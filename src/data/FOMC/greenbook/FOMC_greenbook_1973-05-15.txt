Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Current dollar GNP is expected to increase about $34 billion
this quarter, a somewhat larger rise than projected four weeks ago.
The upward revision reflects entirely an expectation of a larger
average price increase.
The projected second quarter advance in nominal GNP amounts
to an annual rate of 11 per cent, compared with 14 per cent in the first
quarter. We continue also to anticipate a moderation of real growth,
with real GNP projected to increase this quarter at an annual rate of
6 per cent, following rates of 8 per cent in the two preceding quarters.
The rise in the GNP implicit deflator and the private fixed weight
index is expected to slow only a little from the exceptionally rapid
first quarter pace.
Activity in the industrial sector continues brisk. Industrial
production is tentatively estimated to have increased at about an 8-1/2
per cent annual rate in April, about the same as in the first quarter.
Gains in output were widespread, with business equipment particularly
strong. Manufacturing employment also rose considerably further in
April, and the factory workweek edged up to its highest level in over
6 years.
The anticipated moderation of real expansion in the second
quarter reflects primarily an expected slowing of the rise in consumer
spending from the exceptional first quarter pace. Weekly retail sales
suggest a decline in April from the sharply advanced March level.

I -2
Unit auto sales were at an annual rate of 11.7 million in April (9.8
million domestic-type), down somewhat from the first quarter average.
Also, residential construction activity is expected to turn down this
quarter. New housing starts were off 8 per cent in March, and the
decline of permits in recent months suggests a probable further drop
in starts.
Business demands, on the other hand, appear to be strengthen-
ing. The McGraw-Hill survey taken in April indicates an increase of
19 per cent in anticipated business expenditures for plant and equipment
in 1973, compared with 14 per cent indicated by the Commerce survey
taken in February. Much of the upscaling is in durable goods manu-
facturing and is consistent with continued strength in new orders and
increasing reports of pressures on capacity. Inventory/sales ratios
are at unusually low levels, and a sizable increase in inventory invest-
ment appears in prospect in this and coming quarters.
Wage rates advanced more rapidly in March and April than over
the preceding few months, but the average rate of increase in the
hourly earnings index remains moderate thus far in 1973. In real terms,
weekly and hourly earnings have fallen below the highs reached early
last fall.
Wholesale prices of farm products and foods edged up only
slightly in April, following five months of exceptionally large
increases, but prices of consumer finished foods advanced considerably
further. Prices of industrial commodities rose 1.3 per cent, the third
consecutive month of large and widespread increases. On May 2, the

I -3
President announced that prenotification would be required of large
firms that raise the average of their prices by more than 1-1/2 per
cent above that authorized on January 10.
Outlook. The staff continues to assume growth in the mone-
tary aggregates consistent with expansion in M1 at a 5 to 5-1/2 per cent
annual rate this year, and some further rise in market interest rates.
The Federal spending assumptions are unchanged.
The current GNP projection for the second half of 1973
differs little from that of four weeks ago. Growth in real GNP is
still projected to taper off to an annual rate of around 4 per cent
in the fourth quarter, and the unemployment rate to edge down to about
4-3/4 per cent.
We have raised somewhat our projection of business fixed
investment on the basis of the McGraw-Hill survey and also incoming
information on orders. Net exports, on the other hand, are expected
to be a bit weaker. The rise in consumer spending is still projected
to slow appreciably, as growth of disposable income moderates following
completion of tax refunds. Inventory investment is projected to rise
to an annual rate of about $20 billion in the fourth quarter; even
so, stock-sales ratios would remain near recent low levels.
The projected slowdown in the rise in the private GNP fixed
weight price index--from a 6.7 per cent annual rate in the first
quarter to 4.7 per cent in the fourth--reflects primarily the antici-
pation that food price increases will slow sharply from the extra-
ordinary rates of early this year. But rising costs are expected to
exert upward pressure on prices of other goods and services, particularly
producer and consumer durables.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have increased about 0.7 per cent further in April, about
the same percentage as in March, to a level 8.7 per cent above a year
earlier. Gains in output are indicated to be widespread, except for a
number of durable consumer goods which were already at advanced levels.
Production of autos, some household appliances, and color TV
sets have been close to capacity for some months. However, output of
household furniture, room air conditioners, some apparel lines, and
consumer chemical and paper products apparently rose further in April.
Advances in output of business equipment are estimated to be
widespread and to have continued at the rapid rate of growth of recent
months. Among industrial materials, production of raw steel increased
and output of textiles, chemicals and rubber products are indicated to
have risen further, but capacity limitations seem to be restricting
gains in some other materials-producing industries.
Retail sales. Sales in April declined 2 per cent from
March, according to tentative staff estimates based on weekly data.
The lower sales were largely in the automotive, apparel, and general
merchandise groups which had reported unusually large gains in recent
months. Sales of the food group were unchanged from the previous month.
More complete sample counts for February and March slightly
lowered the very large first quarter rise in sales. According to
revised data, first quarter sales were 5.7 instead of 6.0 per cent
above the fourth quarter. The automotive and food groups were primarily
responsible for the lower estimates; the GAF group was revised upward
with the first quarter increase now 6.9 per cent rather than 6.4 per cent.

Unit sales of consumers durables. Sales of new domestic-
type autos were at a 9.8 million unit annual rate in April, down from
the record 10.6 million of March but well above a year earlier. In
the first 4 months of 1973, sales were at an average rate of 10.2
million units.
Foreign car sales in April were at a 1.9 million unit rate,
down 6 per cent from the record level of March but a fourth higher
than a year ago. The import share, on a seasonally adjusted basis was
16.0 per cent, little changed from last month but above the 14.6 per
cent of April last year.
Unit factory sales of major home appliances, TVs, and radios
are estimated to be 4 per cent above March levels, in the basis of
data through the middle of April. Color TV sales increased enough to
more than offset a decline in black and white units and total TV sales
were 5 per cent above March. Appliances were 3 per cent above a month
earlier as air conditioners, washers, driers, refrigerators, and freezers
increased.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted outlays
for new construction were revised upward by 2 per cent to a new high
for March but edged off in April to an annual rate of $136.4 billion.
Private outlays were about unchanged in April while expenditures for
public construction declined owing entirely to Federally owned projects.
The Census Bureau's composite index of construction costs in
April was 144 per cent (1967=100), about the same as the record March
level and 7 per cent above a year earlier. In 1972 as a whole, the
increase had been 5 per cent from 1971.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts dropped sharply
further in March to an annual rate of 2.26 million units. Even so,
the first quarter average matched last year's fourth quarter rate
and was only slightly below the peak--2.43 million units--reached in
the first quarter of 1972. Given the exceptionally strong pace of
housing starts last winter and the downtrend in permits which has
persisted since December, the starts rate may have declined further in
April.

Reflecting continued exceptionally high levels of demand,
rental vacancy rates in the first quarter averaged 5.7 per cent nationally,
the same as the relatively low average in the second half of last year

and only moderately above the average in the first quarter of other
recent years. Vacancy rates for homeowner properties continued at a
minimal 1.0 per cent. However, with the over-all pace of completions
now exceeding a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 million units and
with mobile home shipments expanding considerably further, some rise in
vacancy rates is likely in the period ahead.

Capital spending plans. The McGraw-Hill spring survey of
planned spending for new plant and equipment indicates an increase of
19 per cent in 1973--substantially more than reported in the Commerce
survey released in March. Manufacturers plan to increase spending by
29 per cent, with the sharpest increase relative to previous surveys
coming in durable goods where plans now call for a 38 per cent rise.
Aside from manufacturing, business indicated plans for a 14 per cent
rise, with strength concentrated in utilities, communications, and the
commercial and other category. The increase in this sector was similar
to those shown by earlier surveys.

I -14
Historically, McGraw-Hill surveys taken at this time of the
year and at this point in the cycle have tended to overestimate somewhat
the actual increase realized in capital outlays. A new Commerce survey
should be available in early June.

Bolstered by strength in steel, motor vehicles and defense,
new orders for durable goods showed considerable acceleration in the
first quarter from the fourth quarter. Increases in nondefense capital
goods and household durable goods orders remained close to the high
fourth quarter rates.
Shipments of durable goods were about unchanged in March, but
were up 5 per cent for the first quarter. Backlogs of unfilled orders
continued to increase rapidly in March, and in the quarter as a whole.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturers' inventories rose
at a $14.1 billion annual rate in March (p); the February rate of
$10.4 billion was revised little. For the first quarter as a whole,
the annual rate of increase was $10.2 billion, up from $6.4 billion
in the fourth quarter and the highest since the first quarter of 1967.
Wholesale trade stocks were little changed in March, but the first-
quarter rate of $5.5 billion was higher than the fourth quarter rate.
However, all of these book value increases in large part reflect the
rapid rate of price rise in the first quarter, particularly for foods
and other nondurables.
Manufacturers accelerated their rate of increase in materials
holdings in the first quarter and continued to build work-in-process
stocks at about the advanced fourth quarter rate. The value of
finished goods stocks also rose somewhat, after declining in the fourth
quarter.
By market categories, the acceleration of manufacturers'
book value growth in the first quarter occurred mainly at home goods
and apparel and miscellaneous intermediate goods producers. Book
value increases were slight for consumer staple goods, which probably
declined on a physical volume basis. Stocks of both defense and non-
defense capital goods continued to rise at the relatively high
fourth-quarter rate.

In March, manufacturers' shipments also increased and the
inventory-shipments ratio remained at a low 1.57. Wholesale sales
increased 2-1/2 per cent and the wholesale trade inventory-sales ratio
declined to the lowest point since mid-1966.
At durable goods manufacturers, the inventory-backlog ratio
declined further in March. Overall, this ratio is still well above the
low ratios of previous cycles; but at primary metals manufacturers,
where stocks have been depleted and backlogs have risen rapidly, the
inventory/backlog ratio dropped abruptly in March to the lowest point
since late 1966.MarMar.

Cyclical indicators. The Census composite index of leading
indicators increased 1.4 per cent in March (p), following advances of
1.5 per cent in February and 1.8 per cent in January. The index
before trend adjustment, which has a lead on peaks of at least 6
months, also continued to rise, and by more than its average revision.
The coincident composite index was up 0.9 per cent in March and the

Leading series increasing in March were new orders for durable
goods, industrial materials prices, and the ratio of price to unit
labor cost. The manufacturing workweek was unchanged. Series decreasing
were initial unemployment claims (inverted), contracts and orders for
plant and equipment, housing permits, and common stock prices.
According to revised (but still preliminary) data for March, new orders
rose more than the advance indication used in the preliminary leading
index, and contracts and orders for plant and equipment increased
rather than declined. The change in consumer instalment debt also
increased in March.
In April, common stock prices declined further while the
manufacturing workweek and industrial materials prices rose. It
should be noted that in 1969-72, the materials price index, previously
a leading indicator, behaved more like a lagger.
Labor market. Total employment and the labor force changed
little in April, following sharp advances in the preceding month, and
the unemployment rate remained at 5 per cent--the fifth successive
month at about that rate. Preliminary payroll employment data for
April show a gain of only about 110,000, compared with an average monthly
increase of 240,000 over the past year. Manufacturing employment rose
substantially in April as did State and local government, but con-
struction employment fell owing to bad weather and an increase in
strike activity. A reported decline in trade employment in April may
reflect in part inadequate seasonal adjustments because of the late
Easter this year.

Over the past year, employment expansion has been very large.
Much of the increase has been due to a rapid pick-up in factory jobs,
accompanied by continued gains in service-producing industries. In
addition, the average factory workweek has lengthened, and at 41.1
hours in April was at its highest level since the end of 1966. Over-
time hours have also risen--to 4.1 hours, half an hour longer than a
year ago.
Unemployment and labor force. Although the unemployment rate
has changed little since the end of 1972, it is much lower than a year
ago for most groups. The average duration of unemployment in April
was three weeks shorter than last year. The number of workers
experiencing short-term unemployment (less than 15 weeks) was about the

I -21
same as in April 1972, but there were half a million fewer workers in
the long-term unemployed category. Despite the year-to-year improvement,
unemployment rates for all groups are still well above the cyclical
lows reached in the late sixties.

relatively moderate 5.4 per cent higher than a year earlier and up at

wage increases in the major industry groups over the past year have
been at or below the 5-1/2 per cent wage standard.

Sharply rising consumer prices in recent months have been
eroding real purchasing power. Moreover, an increase in Social
Security taxes for 1973 has further reduced real take-home pay. During
much of 1972 real spendable earnings showed quite substantial increases,
rising at over a 4 per cent annual rate. Since October, however, the
level of real spendable earnings has been declining, and in March 1973
(the latest month for which price data are available) they were no
higher than a year earlier.

Productivity and costs. Productivity continued to grow at a
rapid rate in the first quarter, accompanying the rapid further rise in
output. In private nonfarm activities, output per manhour increased at
a 4.1 per cent annual rate according to preliminary estimates. Output
per manhour has been rising rapidly for the past year and a half,
following a period of cyclical decline in the late sixties, and is now
above its long-run trend.
Compensation per manhour rose sharply--at a 10.6 per cent
annual rate in the first quarter, up from a 7-1/2 per cent rise in the
fourth quarter. Although the quarter's productivity gain was rapid,
the acceleration in compensation resulted in a large rise in unit labor
costs. However, about 3.5 percentage points of the rise in compensation
per manhour in the first quarter was associated with an increase in
employers'contributions to Social Security effective January 1.

I -24
Excluding this Social Security change, unit labor costs in nonfarm
activities rose by about 3 per cent, somewhat less than in the fourth
quarter of 1972.

Industrial relations. In the first of the major manu-
facturing settlements so far this year, the United Rubber Workers
ratified a new three year contract with Goodyear Rubber Co. on April 24
which provides a 16 per cent wage rate increase over the life of the
contract. Covering 23,000 workers in 15 Goodyear plants, the agree-
ment boosts wages 6.0 per cent in the first year, effective July 2,
1973, 4.9 per cent in the second, and 4.5 per cent in the final year
of the contract. There is no cost-of-living provision or wage reopening
clause in the new agreement. In addition to larger monthly benefit
payments, a new early retirement plan was agreed to, whose costs will
depend on the number of workers who opt for early retirement. The
over-all cost of the wage and fringe package apparently averages about
6 per cent a year over the whole period. Negotiations are now under
way at Goodrich, Firestone, and Uniroyal, but apparently worker dissatis-
faction with the Goodyear package led to a strike of 10,000 at 7
Goodrich plants on May 8.
A moderate rate of negotiated wage increase is evident in
data on first quarter major collective bargaining settlements, (those
involving 1,000 or more workers). Wage increases averaged 4.5 per cent
a year over the life of the contract for all contracts, declining from
an average gain of 6.4 per cent in 1972. But the smaller average was
the result mainly of the railroad settlement, involving 500,000 workers,
which provided only a small wage rate adjustment but substantial benefit
increases through reduced payments to the railroad retirement fund.
In manufacturing, the average pay increase of 6.1 per cent over-the-life
of the contract was up slightly from 1972. Very few construction

I -26
industry settlements have occurred so far. For all industries, wage
and benefit gains together averaged 5.5 per cent over the life of
the contract compared with 7.3 per cent in 1972.
In May, major contracts will expire in the electrical
equipment (General Electric) and in the paper industries followed by
the trucking industry early in June.

Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose in March at about the
February rate--10 per cent seasonally adjusted annual rate--as food
prices soared for the third successive month. Prices of other commodities
and of services advanced at annual rates of 4.0 and 3.6 per cent, respec-
tively. Since last December, a 9 per cent annual rate of rise has
boosted the "All items" index to a level 4.7 per cent above March 1972.

In the 3 months from December to March grocery store food
prices climbed nearly 8 percent (not at an annual rate), reaching a
level 11 per cent above March 1972. Meats were up 6 per cent over the
month, 15 per cent from December and 20 per cent from a year ago.
Moreover, poultry prices jumped over 20 per cent in March alone, con-
tributing substantially, as did fresh vegetables and eggs, to the latest
one-month and three-month advances.
According to the USDA chainstore sample, beef and pork prices
in the first half of April remained fairly close to the ceilings imposed
at the end of March. However, there was probably a rise, relatively
small compared to the last few months, between the early March and early
April pricing dates for the CPI.

I -28
The price rise for other commodities has accelerated recently
with a substantial advance for apparel in March and sharp increases for
gasoline and fuel oil in February. Rents have also risen faster in the
last three months--at an annual rate of over 5 per cent, the most rapid
since April 1971. Costs of several other services, including gas,
electricity, and auto and home repair, have advanced in recent months at
rates above those in 1972.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 12.3 per cent between March and April, largely
as a result of widespread and sharply higher prices for industrial
commodities (up 17 per cent at an annual rate). Prices of farm and food
products were only marginally higher, following five months of extremely
rapid increases, although consumer finished foods rose substantially
further.

Further large increases in prices of fuels, especially
gasoline, led the widespread advance in industrial commodity prices in
April. Nonferrous metals and lumber and wood products also increased
in price again; however, there have been some signs of topping out in
lumber prices very recently. Machinery and equipment prices moved higher,
and prices of textile products rose further, at rapid rates. Substantial
increases were also posted for other processed materials and for crude
materials.
Prices for both producers finished goods and consumer nonfood
finished goods have accelerated sharply this year. In 1972, prices of
finished goods, excluding foods, rose about 2 per cent.
The rise in consumer finished foods in the April WPI was
mainly the result of sharply higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables,
poultry, cereal and bakery products, and eggs.

Phase II and Phase III developments--major price indexes.
The recent acceleration in price increases, which is reflected in all
major indexes, appears to be in part a "bulge" following the shift to
Phase III. But much of the rise has been in prices of farm products
and foods, which would have shown comparable increases even if Phase II
controls had been continued. Devaluations of the U.S. dollar with
respect to foreign currencies have also contributed to higher prices.
The GNP deflator and the fixed weight price index for the
private economy increased twice as fast from the fourth to the first
quarter--2 months of which included Phase III--as between the fourth
quarters of 1971 and 1972 which coincide roughly with Phase II. Al-
though the acceleration was sharpest for consumer nondurables (which
include food), it was also marked in consumer durables and services.
In both periods the deflators for the private economy and for personal
consumption expenditures rose less rapidly than the corresponding fixed
weight indexes because of shifts in weights--e.g., a marked increase in
expenditures on durable goods, which have low deflators (with respect
to the 1958 base), relative to other components with high deflators will
tend to lower the over-all deflator.
Consumer prices (CPI) have shown more acceleration in Phase III
than the fixed weight index for PCE largely because the increases in CPI
and components have been computed over the two months from January to
March and the increases in the PCE index from quarterly averages. Food
prices contribute disproportionately to the rise in the CPI in both

I -32
Phase II and Phase II1, but more so in Phase III thus far. However,
commodity prices excluding food (and home purchase and used cars) have
also accelerated recently.
The exceptionally sharp rise in wholesale prices in recent
months reflects in part farm prices and materials prices which are more
volatile than those of finished goods. Soaring prices for farm products
and foods and feeds account for over 60 per cent of the rise in wholesale
prices in Phase II and near half in the first 3 months of Phase III.
Nevertheless, industrial prices rose at an annual rate of 15 per cent
from January to April in contrast to the 3-1/2 per cent rate of
Phase II. The advance in intermediate industrial materials prices has
intensified while crude materials have continued the sharp rise evident
in Phase II. Both producer and consumer finished goods have been
showing sharper gains, with the latter likely to be reflected in coming
months in the nonfood sections of the CPI.

Agriculture. April red meat production declined 12 per cent
from the previous month to the lowest level since mid-1966. The slow-
down in livestock marketings was mainly a response to consumer resistance
and helped keep red meat prices relatively firm. However, broiler prices
have declined 13 per cent since April 1.
Sharply advancing livestock feed prices may curtail expansion
in poultry and hog operations, adversely affecting meat supplies and
prices by late this year. The price of soybean meal has increased
about 50 per cent since April 1 and corn prices have increased 18 per
cent. Continued strong world demand for these commodities, dimming pros-
pects for larger Peruvian fish meal supplies, and weather-delayed plantings
in the U.S. have been major factors causing the large jump in feed prices.
Expected large plantings of corn and soybeans, 12 per cent and
15 per cent greater than last year, respectively, may yet be realized if
wet weather abates. But flooding in the Mississippi Delta is expected to
reduce cotton acreage to 5 per cent below the level farmers had intended
to plant as of March 1. However, high prices may cause farmers in non-
flooded areas to plant more than they had planned earlier. Cotton prices
have risen 20 per cent since April 1, due in part to large sales to
China and Japan.
Winter wheat remains in generally excellent condition.
Higher winter wheat yields combined with larger spring wheat plantings
are expected to result in a record crop, estimated in a May 1 survey to
be 15 per cent above last year.
Agricultural credit. Farm data continue to feature (1) a boom
in land prices and transfer activity, with consequent strong demand for

I -35
mortgage debt; (2) high cash flow and net income, which during the past
winter led to improved rural bank liquidity by permitting relatively
strong deposit gains and production loan repayments; and (3) the prospect
of sharply higher operating expenses to be financed this year, as produc-
tion activity is expanded.
Income and net worth data document a boom in the farming sector.
At an annual rate of $22 billion in the first quarter, net farm income was
running 30 per cent above the $17 billion plateau of 1969-71 and 48 per cent
above the depressed level of 1967-68. The income gain over 1971 averages
$1,800 per farm, at an annual rate, but in farmer psychology may be over-
shadowed by the paper capital gains recorded in the last two years. Due
mainly to higher land and livestock prices, farm proprietors' equity
increased by $55 billion (20.0 per cent) during 1971-72, or by $19,000
per farm--easily the largest two-year percentage gain since the boom of
1950-51. And so far in 1973, higher meat prices have added another $5
billion to the value of the farm livestock inventory, and land prices
have reportedly continued to rise.
New evidence received in April helps confirm that many rural
banks were in a relatively liquid position going into this year's crop
production season. The quarterly agricultural credit conditions survey
conducted by the Minneapolis F.R. Bank found 36 per cent of Ninth District
rural banks with a lower loan/deposit ratio than they desired--the
largest proportion since this question was first asked in 1964--while
only 7 per cent had a ratio higher than desired. Four fifths of the
banks were actively seeking new farm loan accounts. At the same time,
demand for farm loans was evidently strengthening, as one-fourth of the
banks now reported demand greater than usual-double the proportion
reporting in January.

I -36
In spite of the relatively liquid position of rural banks this
past winter, several sources indicate that, apparently in response to
rising short-term money-market yields, bank interest rates on farm
loans have been rising after bottoming out in the third quarter of
last year. The Chicago F.R. Bank's April survey of agricultural banks in
the Seventh District found that the average rate on feeder cattle loans
was 20 basis points above its July 1972 low, and that the average real
estate loan rate had risen 38 basis points over the same interval. In
the April Ninth District survey, 24 per cent of banks reported a trend
to higher short-term rates on farm loans and 18 per cent to higher
long-term rates; none reported a trend to lower rates. The turning
point in these series also appears to be last year's third quarter. In
the FR-FDIC national interest rate survey for the CID, bank rates on
both feeder cattle and other farm production loans began to advance
after July 1972 and had risen 69 and 46 basis points respectively by
April 1973. However, farm lending rates of the two principal institu-
tional suppliers of farm mortgage credit--life insurance companies and
Federal land banks--remain in the range first reached in mid-1972.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Despite a rise in the Federal funds rate since the last meeting
of the Committee, most short-term interest rates have changed little on
balance. Rates on shorter-term Treasury bills are a key exception, and
they have turned down sharply, widening their already large spreads
against the rest of the short-rate structure. This divergent behavior
reflects a reduced supply of Treasury bills and very low dealer inventories.
In addition to the usual seasonal pay-off of tax bills, the Treasury
elected to redeem a sizable part of its maturing May securities and
refunded the rest with longer-term debt. At the same time it announced
that because of its comfortable cash position the usual early summer
need for new borrowing could be deferred until August.
Private short-term rates were about unchanged, except for the
prime rate on bank loans to large businesses and rates on large
negotiable CD's. While banks continued to issue a considerable volume
of CD's in April in the 30- to 89-day maturity range and rates on such
instruments rose 20 basis points further, net new issues of negotiable
CD's were significantly smaller than during earlier months this year.
Business loan growth at banks moderated in April as the
substitution of bank credit for commercial paper financing slowed.
But total short-term business credit demands remained sizable. In
capital markets, demands for funds slackened a bit. With internal
funds generation exceptionally strong, corporate demands remained
moderate. The volume of financing by State and local governments
receded somewhat, reflecting in part rising tax receipts and another
instalment of revenue sharing payments.

II -2
Longer-term security rates continued to fluctuate in a
relatively narrow band. While yields on Treasury notes and bonds
advanced somewhat in response to the debt extension in the May re-
financing, corporate and municipal bond yields have shown little change.
With inflows to nonbank thrift institutions slowing further in April
and outstanding mortgage commitments near record levels, mortgage
interest rates continued to edge higher.
Outlook. Even though corporate internal funds generation
is likely to remain large, the projected continued expansion in
economic activity, and particularly in business investment in fixed
capital and inventories,suggests that corporate demands for credit
will remain sizable. Since underwriters report little build-up in
the prospective calendar of new capital market financing, these business
demands are likely to fall chiefly on short-term markets, especially
commercial banks. However, as the prime rate for large businesses
continues to move up into alignment with the rest of the short-term
rate structure, some diversion of financing back into the commercial
paper market is likely.
Bank issuance of CD's should remain large but below the
record rates of the first quarter. Given the present high cost of CD's,
banks will probably also meet a part of their needs for lendable funds
by further reductions in investments. In this environment bank lending
terms and conditions are expected to tighten further and banks will
probably become less willing lenders.

II -3
At nonbank thrift institutions lending policies are already
being modified in response to the slowing of deposit flows. Deposit
inflows to these institutions are likely to remain depressed in coming
months, assuming no change in Regulation Q ceilings.
To a considerable extent, the impact on rates of expanded
Federal agency borrowing will be mitigated by the absence of any near-
term Treasury demands. Aggregate private short-term credit demands
are likely to remain strong, though not larger than in the first
quarter, and corporate and municipal demands on capital markets appear
likely to be relatively light. Thus, there is little indication that
credit demands, taken by themselves, will generate substantial upward
interest rate pressures. However, continued constraint on the total
supply of lendable funds in the face of currently large demands could
precipitate upward interest rate movements. Moreover, rising interest
rates could lead to an acceleration of financing plans, thereby
reinforcing upward rate pressures--particularly in long-term markets.

II -4
Monetary aggregates. Preliminary data indicate that M1
expanded at an annual rate of 6.5 per cent in April, faster than the
first quarter pace, which had been much slower than might have been ex-
pected given the rapid increase in nominal GNP. 1/ Thus, the April
acceleration may reflect a return to a growth rate more in line with
expanding transactions needs.
Growth in M2 accelerated in April in response to the more
rapid increase in M1, while inflows of consumer-type time and savings
deposits remained close to the moderately strong March pace. In March
and especially in April, inflows of consumer-type time and savings
deposits were temporarily strengthened by deposits of tax refunds.
Also, in mid-April, State of California deposits of tax receipts in
non-negotiable CD's were unusually large. However, given the wide
difference between market interest rates and Regulation Q ceilings,
further growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks
may be expected to moderate from the current pace. Already, inflows
to nonbank thrift institutions have slowed significantly.
Although banks continued to sell a large volume of negotiable
CD's, net sales in April were well below the record levels of February
and March. This slowing was attributable mainly to a moderation in
loan demands. In addition, however, as rates on CD's rose above 7 per
cent, banks apparently began to turn to other, less expensive sources
of funds--including liquidation of investments. They also obtained an
1/ Demand Deposit Ownership Survey data suggest that weakness in the
IPC component of M1 in the first quarter was fairly broadly based.
More detail on this survey will be in the forthccming Supplement.

Bank credit. Total loans and investments of commercial banks
(last-Wednesday-of-the-month series, seasonally adjusted) expanded at
only a 6.4 per cent annual rate in April,1/ sharply below the rapid 20
per cent rate in the first quarter. This slowing was primarily the
result of a moderation in business loan demands, although reductions in
outstanding security and nonbank financial loans and in holdings of
municipals and other securities also contributed. Real estate and con-
sumer loans continued to increase at rapid rates.
By late March, many of the special factors-both international
and domestic--which contributed to the sharp rise in business borrowing
early in the first quarter had begun to dissipate. Consequently, growth
in total short-term borrowings by businesses, as measured by the sum of
bank loans and commercial paper borrowing, slowed from the unusually
rapid pace of January and February. Although below the first quarter
pace, the April growth in these borrowings continued at a strong 19 per
cent rate, above the fourth quarter rate.
Substitution of business loans for commercial paper borrowing
moderated in April, following an almost $4 billion (seasonally adjusted)
run-off of commercial paper in the previous two months. Some modera-
tion in business loan expansion following the record first quarter
growth was to be expected, as corporations drew down their credit lines.
1/ In April the adjusted bank credit proxy increased, on average, at a
13.1 per cent annual rate. However, bank credit, as measured by
total loans and investments, is based on single day, last-Wednesday-
of-the-month data and also includes nonmember banks. Because of this,
the credit proxy often shows somewhat different growth rate patterns
than the bank credit series. If measured from the end of March to
the end of April, the annual rate of increase in the credit proxy
was 9.8 per cent, somewhat closer to the 6.4 per cent growth rate
of bank loans and investments.

Rate relationships, however, still favor corporate use of bank credit,
even though the large business prime rate moved up by 1/4 per cent to
6-3/4 per cent in April, following the CID institution of a two-tier prime
rate, and to 7 per cent in early May.
Weakness in loans to nonbank financial institutions during the
month was largely associated with reduced bank borrowing by finance
companies. This reduction is somewhat surprising since borrowings by
finance companies in the commercial paper market also were relatively
light, even though consumer credit demands remained large. In contrast,
borrowings by other financial institutions at banks--including mortgage
companies-remained strong.
For the second consecutive month, banks experienced a decline
in security loans in April. This decline was associated in part with
a drop in trading positions of government security dealers to unusually
low levels. Also, margin debt of brokers and dealers, other than U.S.
government security dealers, declined sharply in March, and although
more recent data are not yet available, it is possible that this decline
continued in April as well.
The recent reduction in bank security holdings contributed to
a further decline in liquidity ratios at large banks. In April, the
ratio of liquid assets to total liabilities at these banks reached the
lowest level in 16 months.

Consumer credit. In March, consumer credit outstanding rose
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $27.5 billion, about 17 per cent
more than in February and 7 per cent less than the record $29.6 billion
rate of advance in December 1972. In the instalment credit category, the
record first quarter average rate of growth ($24.0 billion) was sharply
above the low in the strike-depressed fourth quarter of 1970 ($2.5 billion),
bolstered mainly by increases in automobile and nonautomotive consumer
goods credit.
Both extensions and repayments for all types of instalment
credit increased during March. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of

extensions rose $5.0 billion from February, with more than one-half of
the growth in personal loan volume.

Consumer borrowing has continued to be facilitated by a reason-
ably ample supply of funds available on terms which have changed little
in recent months. Issuance of the new commercial bank interest rate
criteria by the Committee on Interest and Dividends on April 16 should
contribute to the continued availability of consumer financing at rela-
tively stable rates. Some increase in the attractiveness of commercial
banks as a source of consumer financing is likely to be associated with
the developing trend to use of simple interest instalment loans, which
consumers can readily understand. A large bank in Boston recently
became the third major bank in the nation to convert instalment lending
to a simple interest plan.
U.S. Treasury securities. Treasury bill rates increased about
10 basis points for 3-month maturities to 25 basis points for one-year

II -11
maturities in the week following the April Committee meeting. Since
then, however, bill rates generally have been under downward pressure,
particularly in the past week, when the 3-month and 6-month bill rates
moved down to 6.02 per cent and 6.36 per cent, 17 and 5 basis points
respectively below their levels at the time of the meeting. The rate
on the one-year bill remains somewhat above its mid-April level, however.
The moderate fluctuation in bill rates reflected the influence
of countervailing factors. Upward pressures on bill rates would normally
have been associated with the increases in the bank prime rate, CD rates
and the Federal funds rate over the period. With the further rise in the
average Federal funds rate above 7.40 per cent in the past two statement
weeks, for example, the differential between this rate and the 3-month
Treasury bill rate has widened to nearly 140 basis points, an unuaually
large difference, Other factors, however, insulated Treasury bill rates
from these upward pressures. The market remained in a technically strong
position throughout the period--which is normal for this time of year
when the Treasury seasonally repays debt--as dealer inventories were at
low levels and the volume of bills outstanding was declining. Bill
rates also were held down by the Treasury decision to offer two long term
securities and to pay down $1.6 billion of debt in its mid-May refunding.
Finally, the Treasury announced during the period that it presently
foresees no need to borrow new money in the market until August, and,
in addition, indicated that it plans to reduce the size of its 6-month
bill auction by $100 million for an indefinite period. The lack of
pressure on the market by the Treasury should tend to soften the impact
of continued heavy financing by Federal agencies.

II -12
Yields on longer term Treasury issues generally edged up
about 1/8 of a percentage point in the past 4 weeks, apparently adjusting
to the increase in supply of long term securities resulting from the
Treasury auctions. In these auctions the Treasury sold $2.0 billion of
a 6-7/8 per cent, seven year note and $650 million of a 7 per cent,
25 year bond. Market interest in these issues diminished just prior to
each of the auctions and both issues sold at yields higher than their
coupon rates. The yield on the 7 year note averaged 7.01 per cent with
a stop-out of 7.05 per cent while the average (and stop-out) yield set
in the "dutch" auction of the bond was 7.11 per cent. Both issues have
since been trading at slightly lower yields.
Dealers received relatively large awards in the two auctions,
amounting to $687 million in the case of the notes and $333 million in
the case of the bond. So far, however, they have had good success in
distributing these issues to final investors, and their current holdings
of the notes and bonds are down to about $300 million and $140 million,
respectively.
Private short-term rates. Most private short-term rates have
remained on "dead center" since the April meeting. Rates on short-term
CD's, however, have continued to move higher, apparently responding to
firming in the Federal funds rate and to continued strong bank needs
for lendable funds.
Moreover, the large business prime rate was increased to 6.75
per cent from 6.50 per cent following issuance by the Committee on
Interest and Dividends on April 16 of criteria for a two-tier prime rate.
On May 4, some large banks announced a further increase in this rate to
7 per cent, and many other banks have since followed suit.

Long-term private securities markets. Interest rates on
long-term private securities generally have shown little net change
over the past month. Board indexes of yields on both newly issued
and recently offered Aaa utility bonds have drifted downward 5 to 10
basis points since the April FOMC meeting. Although rates on tax-
exempt bonds rose somewhat in mid-April, the Bond Buyer index
subsequently declined and rates were virtually unchanged over the
period. In corporate and municipal markets underwriter inventory
positions are comfortable, the supply of investment funds ample, and
it appears at present that new issue volume over the second quarter
may be contra-seasonally small. Strong liquidity positions have
reduced dependence of both corporate and municipal borrowers on long-
term markets, and few market participants apparently believe that
long-term rates will rise appreciably over the next few months.

Public offerings of corporate bonds in April amounted to
only $800 million; and, although there are some medium-sized industrial
offerings on the May calendar, the staff estimates that total volume
for this month will be only about $900 million. Scheduled utility
volume for June, however, is already about $700 million, and it is
likely that total public bond volume in June will be over $1 billion.

II -15
For the second quarter as a whole, it now appears that public bond
offerings may remain at about the reduced first-quarter pace. Since
public bond issues usually have a seasonal peak in the second quarter,
this represents an appreciable moderation in corporate long-term
credit demands.

Data on commitment activity and proposed takedowns of bonds
by life insurance companies suggest that private placement volume will
remain large in spite of the small volume reported by the SEC for the
first two months of 1973. The staff estimates that monthly average
takedowns for April and May will be around $600 million, while the
expected volume in June will be considerably greater, reflecting the
usual upward movement in takedowns at the end of each quarter.

II -16
Average new gross equity volume in April and May is estimated
at about $850 million, an historically large volume but more moderate
than in recent months. Some bond fund offerings--which are included
in stock issues--have been reduced in size because of selling problems.
The recent decline in stock prices also has reduced the volume of
smaller equity issues, particularly initial offerings.
Stock prices have fluctuated considerably in the last few weeks
but even with the increases in recent days there has been little
change on balance since the April Committee meeting. At current
levels, stock prices are still well below the recent peak levels in
early January, prior to the shift to Phase III and the developing
concern about rising interest rates. Since the last Committee meeting,
trading activity has averaged lower than the moderate levels of earlier
months this year.

Long-term debt securities offerings by State and local
governments in April fell to about $1.5 billion, a decline which
undoubtedly contributed to the edging downward of yields on such
securities after mid-April. May volume, at about $1.8 billion, is
being boosted by several large revenue bonds but is still less than the
$2.0 billion average of offerings of the last two years. Revenue
bonds account for an unusually high proportion of recent issues, and
these generally higher-yielding securities are particularly attractive
to casualty companies. Underwriters report that banks, too, are
increasing their purchases in the longer maturity ranges in order to
take advantage of the higher yields, although bank holdings of
municipal securities have been declining in the aggregate.

II -18
Nonbank thrift institutions. During April, deposit growth
at savings and loan associations slowed considerably from the upward
revised rate in March. According to sample data, the seasonally
adjusted annual rate of deposit growth at S&L's fell to 5.0 per cent,
the lowest rate since early 1970. However, these sample data may
understate actual deposit growth, as was the case in March. Major
factors contributing to reduced inflows appear to have been higher
interest rates on market instruments relative to those on S&L shares
and the continued high level of consumer spending.
At mutual savings banks, fragmentary data for April suggest
that deposit growth also may have amounted to about a 5 per cent
seasonally adjusted annual rate, a further slowing from the pace during
the first quarter. Deposit experience of large New York City mutual
savings banks--institutions with relatively interest-sensitive deposi-
tors--was especially weak. These institutions had a net outflow of
about $100 million for the month.
While there are reports of a tightening of lending policies
at S&L's recently, outstanding mortgage commitments in March (the
latest available) rose $1 billion. With deposit flows declining and
outstanding mortgage commitments near record levels, S&L's have found
it necessary to increase substantially their borrowing from FHLB Banks
in order to meet takedowns. Such borrowings rose $900 million in April
following a first quarter increase of about $400 million.

Mortgage market. While available data on primary mortgage
market developments for early April show relatively little change,
field reports and trade opinion suggest that yields required by lenders
for home loans have been under upward pressure in recent weeks.
These sources indicate that numerous lenders have stiffened somewhat
their non-rate terms on conventional home mortgages and that low
usury ceilings in certain States have begun to restrain lending.
In the secondary market, expectations of some further increase
in mortgage yields over the period ahead have persisted, judging from
the results of the latest FNMA auctions (April 30) of commitments to
purchase home mortgages within 4 months. In the case of the-auction
for FHA/VA commitments, the average yield to FNMA tended upward
further--to 7.91 per cent, 23 basis points above the recent low late
last year; offerings to FNMA remained near the advanced levels maintained
since mid-March. In FNMA's associated auction of forward purchase
commitments for high-ratio conventional home mortgages, the rise in yields
remained appreciably greater. However, offerings in this auction con-
tinued well below the FHA/VA volume.
Net flows of credit to all types of mortgages apparently
accelerated during the first quarter of 1973 to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of around $80 billion, judging from preliminary estimates.
This was sharply above the recent low of $21 billion in early 1970.
Although net expansion in both nonresidential and residential mortgage
debt outstanding advanced to new highs, the increase for the residential
sector was especially striking--to an annual rate approximating $60
billion, compared with $45 billion a year earlier. Savings and loan

II -21
associations accounted for about half the increase in mortgage debt
outstanding during the first quarter. However, the net contribution
from commercial banks and mutual savings banks was also exceptionally
large for this time of year, and net activity by FNMA and related
agencies operating in the secondary market expanded further on average.

Federal finance. The staff has raised its estimate of fiscal
year 1973 receipts by $1.0 billion since the April Greenbook. The
current projection of $232.5 billion, together with an unchanged out-
lays estimate of $249.8 billion, results in a revised deficit forecast
of $17.3 billion.
The higher revenue projection partly reflects recent larger
than expected receipts (based on preliminary data for April and actual
figures for March). Part of this excess was in withheld taxes,
suggesting that taxpayers have not made any significant adjustments to
overwithholding. Although payments of personal tax refunds were
delayed through March, April refund payments, estimated to be $6.4
billion, were large--almost twice last year's level. As a result, we
also have raised our estimate of refunds by about $1 billion to $21.0
billion for the fiscal year. The table shows the current status of
refund payments compared with a year ago.

While the rate of Federal spending in recent months suggests
that outlays for the current fiscal year could fall about $2.0 billion
short of the budget figure, the staff has not lowered its estimate
below the Administration's figure, on the assumption that the budget
estimate will be achieved by an acceleration of spending in June and
perhaps by a shortfall in planned asset sales (negative outlays).
Through April, we estimate that only $3.4 billion of the projected
$5.5 billion of financial asset sales have been made. Moreover, a
large proportion of the planned $750 million sales from the Defense
Department stockpile of strategic materials remains to be achieved,
including $350 million which requires Congressional approval.
On May 2, Secretary Schultz announced that the Treasury had
raised its revenue forecasts for fiscal 1973 by $5 billion, to a total
of $230 billion, and for fiscal 1974 by $7 billion. The forecast of
outlays was not revised. This reduced the corresponding official
deficit projections for these years to $19.8 billion and $5.7 billion,
respectively. The Treasury is now using income assumptions for 1973
of $1,283 billion for GNP; $1,030 billion for personal income; and
corporate profits before taxes of $115.7 billion. Our receipts estimate
for fiscal year 1973 is $2.5 billion higher than the revised Treasury
projection due partly to our assumptions of higher corporate profits
and effective personal and social insurance tax rates. Secretary Schultz
also presented the Administration's new tax proposals which are dis-
cussed briefly in an Appendix to be included in the Supplement.

II -24
On a high employment budget basis, we are now projecting a
deficit of $3.5 billion for fiscal 1973 and a deficit of $.8 billion
for the calendar year. These deficits are shallower than the staff
had previously projected, and indicate little shift in net stimulus
from calendar year 1972 to 1973. However, the stimulus (as measured
by the high employment deficit) is still considerably greater in the
first half of calendar 1973 than in the second half due to the continued
slowing of growth in expenditures as the year goes on, and the concen-
tration of refund payments in the first half year.
The end-of-April Treasury cash balance was $14.2 billion,
$1.0 billion more than projected in the April Greenbook. The increase
was accounted for entirely by the higher than anticipated revenues
received during the month. Given the projected pattern of outlays and
receipts and assuming no extensive repayment of special issues recently
purchased by foreign central banks, it is unlikely that the Treasury
will need to engage in any further cash borrowing before the refunding
scheduled for August. Moreover, there will be no need for the Treasury
to sharply reduce its currently very large balance at the Federal
Reserve until early June.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. Since mid-March the official settlements
balance has registered a substantial surplus, reversing perhaps one fifth
of the deficit of February and early March. Most of the reduction in
liabilities to foreign official accounts since mid-March has been in
Japanese balances here, partly the result of large official prepayments.
Foreign exchange markets have been functioning smoothly. Euro-dollar rates
have recovered from the distortions of the speculative period, and are
currently reflecting the general firming of interest rates in national
markets.
Some of the improvement in the over-all balance has stemmed
from a favorable shift to net inflows from commercial banks abroad, in
contrast to the large outflows that were a major feature of the period
of speculation. There has probably also been some reversal of the leads
and lags and other financial flows that normally escape statistical
reporting. Data are not yet available for the trade balance or trans-
actions in securities in April, but it seems unlikely that results in
these sectors were as favorable as in March, when the trade deficit was
unexpectedly small and there were still unusually large net foreign
purchases of U.S. corporate stocks.
In the months ahead the trade balance will probably show some-
what larger deficits than in the first quarter -- partly because the
bulge in agricultural exports in the first quarter may have been tempo-
rary, and partly because much of the adverse terms of trade effects from
devaluations still lies ahead. Moreover, the rapid rise of demand in

III -2
the United States that began last year will be exerting a strong pull
on imports for some time to come. On the other hand, the outlook for
nonagricultural exports is bright. Export orders for manufactures have
been rising for some time, and the devaluations have by now probably
begun to have a significant effect on the volume of shipments.
Export prospects are buoyed by high and rising rates of economic
activity in nearly all industrial countries. Although counter-measures
against excess demand and price inflation are being taken -- especially
in Germany and Japan -- overall economic activity in industrial countries
should continue to expand vigorously. In particular, private invest-
ment expenditures for machinery and equipment, which did not contribute
much to economic activity last year, are beginning to rise substantially,
and this sector is of particular importance for U.S. exporters.
At present the odds are probably better than they have been
for some time that confidence in the dollar will not be shaken by a
major disappointment with the trade performance of the United States --
although temporary setbacks may occur -- and that an unwinding of hedged
positions against the dollar will continue. The principal dangers would
lie in a turn for the worse in U.S. price performance and pressures on
the ability of U.S. suppliers to respond to demand from both domestic
and foreign sources.

III -3
Foreign Exchange Markets. Exchange markets have been very
quiet for the most part in recent weeks. The dollar firmed moderately
until May 8 against every major currency save for sterling, with the
sharpest gains occurring after the release of U.S. trade figures for
March. The dollar's overall appreciation was restrained by continued
heavy intervention sales of dollars by the Bank of Japan -- $1.1 billion
in the four weeks ended May 8 and $1.8 billion since markets reopened
on March 19. The unwinding of leads and lags, an upsurge in Japanese
imports in response to a booming domestic economy, and various special
factors have combined to produce a strong demand for dollars in the
Tokyo market. The Bank of Japan seems to have set an implicit floor
for the yen of 16 per cent over its old Smithsonian rate.
The European band was fully extended on most days over the
past month, with the guilder at the bottom and the French franc, and
occasionally the Scandinavian currencies, at the top. The guilder was
also at its lower limit vis-à-vis the Belgian franc within the narrower
Benelux band for most of the period. In intervention operations, the
Netherlands Bank sold in excess of $200 million equivalent of Belgian
francs and other European currencies. Conditions in the Dutch money
market were very easy during April and into early May in contrast to
other national markets in Europe.
The German mark, which had previously occupied the nethermost
position in the snake, firmed against other European currencies, apparently
on the strength of extremely tight money market conditions in Germany.

III -4
(Call money was quoted at rates in excess of 20 per cent on some days
and was seldom below 12 per cent during the period).
Sterling, alone among the major foreign currencies to strengthen
against the dollar up to May 8, has benefited from a shift in expectations
resulting from an apparent improvement in Britain's domestic economic
outlook. Labor relations have seemingly improved and measured inflation
(of non-food prices) has slowed while elsewhere in the world inflation
has worsened.
On May 8 and 9, the mark led a general rise in European
currencies against the dollar. The market turned uneasy following
indications that the German government would soon propose very severe
anti-inflation measures and that the government's economic consultants
had suggested that a further revaluation of the mark against European
currencies might be required within six months. A government denial,
on May 9, that it would even consider a revaluation did little to
reassure the market.
Euro-dollar market. The decline in Euro-dollar rates after
the resolution of the March exchange market crisis ended in mid-April.
Since then, rates have moved up slightly in the shorter maturities, and
somewhat more for 3-month funds, under the influence of rising interest
rates in the United States and abroad (notably Germany). The excess of
the 3-month Euro-dollar rate over the 60-89 day CD rate has widened to
75 basis points as of May 9, but the current differential of 30 points

III -5
between 1-month Euro-dollars and 30-59 day CD's shows little change
from mid-April.
The sharp rise in the Federal funds rate in the past month
has lifted that rate above the overnight Euro-dollar rate from time to
time since mid-April. In the statement week ending May 9, U.S. banks
with reserve free bases found it cheaper, by an average of 64 basis
points, to borrow overnight Euro-dollars than to borrow Federal funds.
But in the two preceding weeks, overnight Euro-dollars were on average
more costly than Federal funds. U.S. banks' borrowings from their
foreign branches continued to decline slowly through the statement
week ending May 2, dropping to a daily average of $2.22 billion compared
with $2.36 billion in the week of April 4. On the other hand, U.S.
agencies and branches of foreign banks substantially increased their
foreign liabilities in the three weeks up to May 2.

U.S. balance of payments. In April, the balance on the
official settlement basis was a surplus estimated at about $1 billion,
as U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks reversed some of the
reduction in liabilities to foreign commercial banks that had occurred
during the monetary turmoil of February and early March. Details on
April transactions are still very meager but the surplus in that month
reflects among other things, a special repayment of $175 million of
post World War II debt by Japan. Allowing for a continuing sizable
deficit on current account and long-term capital, the April surplus
suggests a return flow -- on the order of $1-1/2 billion -- of some
of the funds that had left the country earlier in the year, including
a $400 million reduction in commercial bank claims on foreigners
(according to the weekly banking statistics).
More complete data are now available on transactions in the
first quarter. The overall balance on the official settlements basis
in the first quarter was a large deficit of $10.2 billion (seasonally
adjusted but not at an annual rate). The trade deficit, although
substantially lower than in the fourth quarter, was about $900 million;
bank claims on foreigners increased by about $3-1/4 billion (seasonally-
adjusted) while liquid liabilities to commercial banks abroad and other
private foreigners decreased by $2 billion. Net payments connected
with remittances, pensions, and U.S. Government grants and credits
amounted to about $1.3 billion. These outflows were only partially

III -8
offset by the continued large sales of U.S. securities to private
foreigners -- $1-1/4 billion of corporate stocks and over $1/2 billion
of bonds, mainly offshore issues. On balance there was a net liquidation
of foreign securities in the first quarter; U.S. purchases of foreign
bonds remained at a low level while there were continued net sales of
foreign stocks. The surplus on investment income, other services, and
military transactions is estimated to have been about $1/2 billion.
The sum of these transactions is an outflow of about $5 billion.
If net direct investment outflows were roughly $1-1/2 billion, total
recorded payments would amount to some $6-1/2 billion, compared to an
over-all deficit of about $10 billion. The difference would represent
unrecorded transactions of U.S. investors and others positioning
themselves against an expected dollar devaluation by increasing their
net dollar liabilities and their net foreign-currency assets.
U.S. foreign trade. The trade deficit in March fell sharply
to less than $1 billion at an annual rate (balance of payments basis)
as exports advanced strongly while imports were unchanged from the
high levels of the preceding two months. For the first quarter, the
trade deficit was $3-3/4 billion at an annual rate, nearly $3 billion
less than the deficit rate in the fourth quarter of 1972. Both exports
and imports increased extraordinarily from the fourth to the first
quarter; exports rose by over 15 percent, imports by 9 percent.
A major element in the steep climb of exports, in March as
well as earlier in the quarter, was the very sharp acceleration in

III -9
shipments of agricultural commodities. Although these commodities are
less than one-fourth of total exports, they accounted for more than
one-half of the total rise in exports in the first quarter; about one-
third of the higher value resulted from higher prices -- particularly
for soybeans. The value of agricultural exports in the first quarter
was $15-1/4 billion at an annual rate (over $16-1/2 billion in March).
In calendar 1972 agricultural exports were only $9-1/2 billion.
Although the value of agricultural exports is expected to
remain high in the next few months -- with a further rise in prices
offsetting a possible drop in volume due to supply limitations -- it is
likely that these exports will fall to a lower rate in the course of
the year.

Deliveries of aircraft are also expected to decline from the

rise considerably given the strong expansion in industrial output abroad.

III -10
Foreign orders for machinery rose further in March and for the first
quarter averaged 16 percent higher than in the fourth quarter. Foreign
orders for steel, nonferrous metals and other types of durable equipment
are also on the rise.
Imports in the first quarter were, in total, considerably
higher than in the fourth quarter. Following a sharp advance in
January, however, there was no further advance in February and March
although import unit-values rose quite strongly in March -- nearly
2 percent. Unit values of foodstuffs (coffee, meat, sugar), semi-
finished industrial materials and finished goods (particularly cars)
were all up in March, reflecting the first price effects of the February
devaluation as well as other factors now pushing up prices generally.
The rise in imports in the first quarter was led by imports
of petroleum. Imports of fuel jumped by 19 percent and in March
reached an annual rate of $6-1/2 billion, compared with less than
$5 billion in the year 1972. Other increases are summarized in the
table. Domestic sales of cars from Europe and Japan continued at a
high level in April, holding close to an annual rate of 2 million units,
well above the first quarter level of imports. The strength in April
sales is attributed to heavy purchases of Japanese cars as higher
prices for these cars were not posted by Japanese producers until
mid-April.

The reduction in the trade deficit in the first quarter shows
up in improved U.S. trade balances with Western Europe and Japan.
Heavy shipments of agricultural commodities and aircraft were the main
elements in the strong rise in exports to Western Europe, turning the
deficit that had prevailed with that area throughout most of 1972 into
a surplus in the first quarter. Exports to Japan, particularly
agricultural products but also machinery, rose sharply in the first
quarter while imports from Japan were only moderately higher.
Consequently the trade deficit with Japan in the first quarter fell to
an annual rate of $2-3/4 billion, compared with a rate of over $4 billion
in each quarter of 1972.

III -12
Balance of payments outlook. The outlook for the balance of
payments for the rest of the year has recently been reviewed by an inter-
agency committee, in the light of the striking developments evident in
the still incomplete data for the first quarter. For the basic balance --
current account and long-term capital -- a deficit on the order of
$8 billion is projected for the year, although the first-quarter rate may
have been somewhat lower. No attempt is made to project the official
settlements balance; whether the over-all deficit is much larger or
smaller than the $10 billion registered in the first quarter will depend
on the behavior of volatile funds. While there has been some unwinding
since mid-March of the outflows associated with currency disturbances,
a major reflow is still inhibited by rising interest rates abroad and
lingering doubts about the stability of the present exchange rate relation-
ships.
Projections of the trade balance for the year still anticipate
a deficit of about $5 billion, even though the first-quarter rate was
less than $4 billion. The worsening of the balance after the first
quarter assumes, among other things, that the annual rate of exports of
agricultural commodities, at $15.2 billion in the first quarter, will be
dropping to $12 billion after mid-year. There is a possibility that further
price increases will be large enough to offset the likely drop in volume
of agricultural exports, in which case the trade balance for the year
could be substantially better. However, the adverse effects of the
devaluations, especially the more recent changes in the dollar prices

III -13
and value of imports, will probably be stronger in the months ahead,
and allowance must be made for rising petroleum imports at higher prices.
On the other hand, prospects are good for strong demand for
U.S. exports in other industrial countries, where there is a broadly-
based rapid increase in demand, and also in some of the developing countries
with large reserve holdings. Consequently, after some worsening in the
summer months the trade balance is expected to improve considerably,
though still showing deficits into 1974.
Although the 1973 trade deficit should show a considerable gain
over the 1972 result, net receipts of income on investments are expected
to fall, yielding a rather limited gain in the combined balance on goods
and services. While receipts from U.S. direct investments abroad are
projected to continue to score large gains -- mainly because of the boom
in economic activity in foreign countries -- this will be more than
offset by rising interest payments to foreigners. Taking into account
the higher level of liquid liabilities to foreigners, much of which
came early in the year, and the year-over-year rise in U.S. interest
rates, interest payments on these liabilities will rise by well over
$2 billion.
No important shifts are expected in net military expenditures,
or in the balance of other service transactions. A new element in the
picture is a reduction of nearly $.5 billion in net U.S. Govt. grants
and capital flows, stemming primarily from special transactions with
Japan and advance payments on military export orders.

III -14
An area of great uncertainty is the future of flows of private
long-term capital. In the current projection the net flow of such
capital is projected to be about in balance, as it was in 1972, but
this depends on a number of important assumptions, including general
stability in exchange markets. The net outflow of U.S. private long-term
capital is put at not much above the 1972 rate of $5.4 billion, with
direct investment outflows rising only moderately in response to the
pick-up in economic activity abroad. U.S. banks increased their long-
term claims on foreigners by about $1.3 billion in 1972, and are projected
to have somewhat smaller outflows this year.
The net inflow of foreign private long-term capital was
$5.6 billion in 1972 and is projected to rise slightly in 1973. A
crucial factor will be the attitude of foreign investors toward U.S.
corporate stocks and the offshore borrowings of U.S. direct investment
companies. Such investments accounted for $4.5 billion of the inflow in
1972, and they are projected to be somewhat larger this year. This is
based on the assumption that following the spurt in foreign purchases
of U.S. corporate stocks in the first quarter -- when net purchases totaled
$1.2 billion -- there will be a smaller but still substantial rate of
inflow in the rest of the year, bringing the total to over $3 billion.
However, it is also assumed that offshore corporate borrowing will be
reduced to about $1-1/2 billion from nearly $3 billion in 1972. This
slowdown reflects both some difficulties in placing dollar-denominated
bonds in the Euro-bond market and also the uncertainty faced by the

III -15
direct investors, who prefer to hold down their borrowings in view of
the expected termination of the controls. It appears that the offshore
financing will increasingly take the form of shorter-term bank loans,
so as to result in a minimum of high cost foreign borrowing outstanding
after the end of 1974.
If the present projection is nearly correct, it suggests that
gains in the basic balance will come gradually in 1973, with improvement
in the trade balance showing up strongly only late in 1973 and into 1974
as demand pressures in the United States abate. This picture could be
changed for the better, however, if agricultural exports stay close to
their recent high level.

III -16
Economic Activity in Major Foreign Industrial Countries.
Economic activity in most of the major industrial countries expanded
rapidly during the second half of 1972 and, on the basis of preliminary
indicators, during the first quarter of 1973. As shown in the table on
the following page, real GNP for these countries as a whole grew at an
annual rate of 5.9 per cent from 1971 to 1972, and this rate is expected
to increase to 7 per cent from 1972 to 1973. In most foreign countries,
as in the United States, the underlying strength of activity was somewhat
greater than had been forecast, mainly because private consumption expendi-
tures rose more rapidly than had been anticipated. Private capital
investment, relatively sluggish in 1972, is expected to accelerate and
contribute substantially to growth in 1973, as is inventory investment.
Consequently, rapid growth of output is expected to continue during the
rest of this year -- in most cases with further acceleration as the
expansion becomes broader based.
Unemployment has dropped substantially in most of the countries.
Tightness in some segments of the labor market is exerting upward
pressure on labor costs -- even in countries where the overall unemploy-
ment rate is still high. Despite tightening labor market conditions,
wage increases early this year were relatively moderate. However, the
high current rates of price increases have caused more recent settlements
to be higher -- and in Germany, for example, there is talk of reopening
later this year negotiations on settlements made in January and February.

Thus, in most countries, inflationary expectations rather than labor
market shortages seem to be the major factor making for faster rises
in wage demands.
As illustrated by the changes in GNP deflators in the table,
rates of inflation have been increasing rapidly. The sharp worldwide
upward movement of agricultural and raw material prices which began in
the second half of 1972 has been a notable feature of the situation.
With increasing demand pressures, the OECD's forecasting group now antici-
pates an acceleration of prices of manufactures and services almost
everywhere in the course of this year, as well as continued increases in
basic commodity prices. In addition, the EEC farm price decisions of
May 1 will contribute further to increases in food prices in the
European countries.
With the acceleration of inflationary trends, a number of
countries have adopted a more restrictive policy stance in order to
moderate demand and price pressures. Monetary policy measures have been
widely employed to date, but further and more varied policy moves can
be expected. So far, a comprehensive set of wage and price controls
has been employed only in the United Kingdom.
The economic recovery in Germany dating roughly from the
beginning of 1972 is developing into a broad-based boom. Most
observers now expect the increase in German real GNP in 1973 over 1972
to be about 6 per cent, a more rapid rate than was officially anticipated
just a few months ago.

III -19
Exports have played the leading role in the expansion to date.
The rapid rise in new industrial orders from abroad -- 70 per cent,
annual rate, from July-August 1972 to January-February 1973 -- indicates
that exports will continue to be a major stimulative force. However,
business surveys as well as the rise in domestic new orders suggest that
a marked recovery in private capital investment is also likely to occur
this year.
The high rate of capacity utilization at a time when demand
continues to expand rapidly is adding considerably to inflationary
expectations. The overall capacity utilization rate in industry was
in excess of 85 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1972 (compared to a
peak of over 90 per cent during the boom of 1970) and has certainly risen
since then; the unemployment rate (s.a.) averaged a very low 1 per cent
in the first three months of 1973. The tightness in the labor market
is exerting upward pressure on wages, but a major factor in increasingly
stronger wage demands has been the fast price rise of recent months and
the expectation that prices are likely to continue to rise rapidly.
Although some budgetary restraint is being exercised, the
German authorities currently are relying primarily on monetary policy
to slow inflation. The Bundesbank's determination to maintain monetary
stringency was demonstrated by its willingness to allow the rate on
overnight interbank loans to soar to record-breaking heights. And on
May 3, the discount and the Lombard rates were raised by 1 percentage

III -20
point to 6 and 8 per cent, respectively. However, there are general
expectations that the government will announce an anti-inflation
package which is likely to include various tax measures. Since the
German government believes that developing excess demand is the base
of the inflationary pressures, price and wage controls are not likely
to be instituted.
Economic activity in the United Kingdom has increased rapidly
since mid-1972. Real GDP rose at an annual rate of over 6 per cent
from the first to the second half of the year, although the growth rate
was distorted by strikes in the first and third quarters of the year.
The main expansionary element of demand has been private consumption
expenditure, which rose at an annual rate of 8 per cent from the
first to the second half of last year, and at a rate of 11 per cent in
the first quarter of this year. However, these recent rates of growth
reflect to some extent anticipatory buying before the introduction of
the value-added tax (VAT) on April 1, 1973.
Unemployment began to fall sharply in the second half of 1972.
In April 1973, the unemployment rate (s.a.) in Great Britain was 2.7 per
cent compared with 3.8 per cent a year earlier; a rate of about 2 per
cent is considered optimum. Job vacancies for adults now are higher than
at any time since the boom years of 1965-66.
The outlook is for a growth rate of real GNP in 1973 of about
6 per cent -- above the official target rate of 5 per cent -- assuming

III -21
a continuation of the present policy posture, with heavy reliance on
wage and price controls. A survey recently released by the Confedera-
tion of British Industry confirms earlier forecasts that private
investment expenditures and exports will provide the major stimulus.
However it also suggests that supply constraints will become increasingly
important.
The faster rate of economic expansion in France,which began
in the middle of 1972,is expected to continue with real GNP growing by
about 6.0 per cent, in line with the target rate of the 1971-75 plan.
Industrial production has been increasing exceptionally fast -- 12 per
cent, annual rate, from August 1972 through February 1973.
The most substantial stimuli to economic activity have been
exports and private consumption. With the expected growth in world
trade, export expansion is expected to continue in 1973, and consumer
expenditure may grow even more rapidly than in 1972. The strength of
private consumption is mainly due to the rapid rise in personal incomes.
Hourly wages rose 12.3 per cent in 1972, and the tightening in the labor
market, especially for skilled workers, coupled with stronger union de-
mands, suggests that increases in earnings will be somewhat larger in
1973. Utilization of capacity is now higher than at any time since
1969-70. In addition, planned investment expenditures are being revised
upward and in 1973 may rise by about 8 per cent in real terms.

III -22
As elsewhere, price increases are a major policy concern in
France. The December 1972 consumer price index was 6.9 per cent above
its year earlier level. The government's December anti-inflationary
program included direct action on prices through selective VAT reductions,
as a result of which retail price levels in January and February increased
only slightly or not at all. However, the upward trend resumed in March.
On May 3 the French government renewed its system of price guidelines
with a 3.6 per cent ceiling (compared to 3 per cent a year ago) for
price increases of most industrial goods over the next twelve months.
A sharp upturn in economic activity in Italy in the fourth
quarter of 1972 -- reflected in a 9 per cent rise in industrial pro-
duction -- was induced by a renewed surge in exports and a strengthening
in several components of domestic demand -- specifically, consumer spend-
ing, residential construction, and continued rebuilding of inventories.
Some of this increase resulted from anticipatory buying in advance of
the introduction of the VAT at the beginning of 1973, and some in
expectation of renewed strike activity in the first quarter. In fact,
industrial output in the first quarter of 1973 was sharply lower because
of strikes.
Prospects now appear favorable for a sustained increase in
economic activity in Italy for the first time in four years. The sign-
ing of new wage contracts in the metal and engineering industries in the
first week in April removed a major uncertainty for employers that had

III -23
been a depressant to investment. The contracts provide for large pay
increases that should cause consumer spending to rise more rapidly. A
significant share of the cost pressures that might have resulted from
the large wage increases is expected to be alleviated by the proposed
shifting of part of the cost of social security contributions from
employers to the budget.
Price rises have accelerated sharply since the summer of 1972
with the GNP deflator expected to peak at an annual rate of 9 per cent
in the first half of 1973. The introduction of the VAT and the effect
on import prices of the depreciation of the lira further contributed to
the acceleration of the inflation rate. By the second half of this year,
this rate may drop off to about 6-1/2 per cent, still high by past
standards. Nevertheless, absorption of economic slack remains the main
policy objective at this time,and anti-inflationary measures are likely
to aim at the reduction of costs rather than of demand.
Economic activity in the Netherlands advanced briskly from
mid-1972 through January of this year. Exports appear to have been
the major contributor to the pickup in activity. Seasonally adjusted
unemployment declined from August 1972 through January 1973, but remained
high by Dutch standards. In addition, job vacancies also fell, leaving
the ratio of unemployed to vacancies at around 2 to 1.
Real output statistics are not available beyond January, but
rises in unemployment since then suggest that strikes which plagued the

III -24
economy from the latter part of February to the latter part of April
slowed the growth of output. The strikes stemmed primarily from labor-
management conflict over determination of an acceptable formula for
granting pay increases in connection with rises in consumer prices. A
provisional agreement was reached at the end of April, providing for
proportionately higher cost-of-living wage boosts for lower paid workers.
The government estimates that average earnings will rise by 13-1/2
per cent from 1972 to 1973.
Real GNP this year is projected to exceed last year's total
by 4 per cent. Steep rises are expected in exports and in private non-
residential investment.
Inflation in the Netherlands remains severe -- overall consumer
prices in February were 7.2 per cent above their year-ago level, as
were those for all items excluding food. However, partly because the
economy is still operating at a level well below capacity and partly
because until a few days ago it still had not been possible to form a
new government, the interim government has not pursued a very active
stabilization policy.
The economic expansion in Japan which began in early 1972
accelerated through the year. Real GNP increased by 9.2 per cent in
1972 over 1971. By the fourth quarter of 1972 the rate of growth had
accelerated to 15.2 per cent per annum. Government capital expendi-
ture, private consumption expenditure, private construction, and

III -25
exports were the main factors contributing to growth in 1972. Real
GNP in 1973 is expected to rise by 11-1/4 per cent over the 1972
level, with private investment expenditure becoming an important
factor.
Since late last year, consumer and wholesale prices have
been increasing sharply. March 1973 wholesale prices were 11 per
cent above their year earlier levels, while consumer prices (Tokyo)
were up 9 per cent. Recent large wage increases of 18 per cent in
the transport industry may well set the pattern for other industries.
The Bank of Japan began to tighten its monetary policy late
last year. Credit restraints were introduced for the first and
second quarters of 1973, reserve requirements were increased in January
and again in March, and the basic discount rate was increased from 4.25
per cent to 5.0 per cent on April 2, 1973. But the liquidity position
of the private sector is very comfortable, so that the effect of the
recent monetary policy measures is not likely to be readily apparent.
Monetary policy is expected to remain tight as price inflation is likely
to continue. Fiscal policy, which was very stimulative last year, will
continue to contribute significantly to overall demand, particularly to
investment demand, this year -- albeit at a declining rate.
Economic activity in Canada in 1972 continued to be strong for
the second consecutive year. Preliminary estimates indicate the same
real rate of growth of Canadian GNP in 1972 as in 1971 -- 5.5 per cent --

III -26
despite an interruption in the third quarter of 1972 resulting from
strikes and bad weather. Private consumption expenditure and resi-
dential construction were especially strong during 1972. Forecasts
for the growth of real GNP for 1973 range from 6.5 to 7 per cent, as
business investment is expected to pick up strongly.
The increase in output in 1972 was accompanied by large
employment gains. However, the labor force was also growing rapidly,
and the unemployment rate for 1972 was 6.3 per cent -- virtually the
same as in 1971. The unemployment rate (s.a.) has subsequently
decreased from 6.7 per cent in December 1972 to 5.5 per cent in March
1973 -- the lowest level in three years. However, regional disparities
in unemployment persist. The seasonally adjusted March unemployment
rates ranged from 3.9 per cent in Ontario to 8.3 per cent in the Atlantic
provinces.
Inflation is a problem in Canada as elsewhere. Price rises
accelerated in 1972 and are expected to continue high in 1973. The
March consumer price index was 6.0 per cent above its level one year ago,
and the GNP deflator is rising at an annual rate of about 5 per cent.
Fiscal policy in Canada remains expansionary. The February
budget aimed mainly at encouraging economic growth to reduce unemploy-
ment, although it was also directed toward decreasing the rate of
inflation. There are some indications that the Bank of Canada may pur-
sue a somewhat less expansionary monetary policy in 1973. On April 6

III -27
it raised the discount rate by 1/2 percentage point to 5-1/4 per cent;
this was followed by an increase in the prime lending rates of the
chartered banks on April 9 from 6 to 6-1/2 per cent. Still, economic
activity may not be restrained very much. Most forecasts assume that
the proposed reductions in corporate tax rates and the liberalization
of write-off provisions will be put into effect. But, even if these
were not to materialize, the large increases in business investment
forecast for this year are still likely to come about, because most of
the anticipated spending is already in the pipeline.
