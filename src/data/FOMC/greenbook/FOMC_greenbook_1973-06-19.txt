Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFIANCIAL DEVELOPM ENTS
The staff is now projecting expansion of over $36 billion in
nominal GNP this quarter--$2 billion more than four weeks ago, and an
annual rate of increase of almost 12 per cent. The upward revision
reflects a considerably more rapid rate of price increase than assumed
earlier. Projected expansion in real GNP has been reduced somewhat--to
an annual rate of 5.7 per cent.
A slowing in the pace of real growth from the 8 per cent
annual rate of the two preceding quarters is suggested by the recent
course of industrial production and developments in the labor market.
The rise in the April index of industrial production has been revised
down slightly and the May advance is estimated at an annual rate of 6
per cent. In the first quarter, industrial production had increased
at an 8.5 per cent annual rate. But gains in output were still widespread
in May among consumer goods--both durable and nondurable--business
equipment, construction products, and nondurable materials. Growth in
nonfarm payroll employment has moderated considerably in the last two
months, following an exceptionally rapid rise over an extended period.
Consumer spending is projected to rise about $19 billion this
quarter, following a remarkable first quarter increase of $28 billion.
The advance retail sales estimate for April has been revised to show a
sharper decline than first reported; in May, despite an increase of
1.5 per cent, sales were only about one-half per cent above the first
quarter monthly average. Unit auto sales in May were at an annual rate
of 12.0 million (10.1 domestic), a little below the first quarter average.

I-2
The long-predicted decline in residential construction
activity is clearly under way, with both housing starts and permits
down appreciably further in April. On the other hand, net exports of
goods and services are now expected to improve further in the second
quarter.
Business demands continue strong. A number of indicators
suggest continued expansion in business fixed capital outlays. Newly
approved capital appropriations by manufacturers rose 15 per cent further
in the first quarter, and the unspent backlog also rose sharply. Manu-
facturers' new orders for durable goods have continued generally
expansive, despite a small decline in April. The square footage of
commercial and industrial construction contracts has remained at
advanced levels. Prospective strength in business demands for inven-
tories is suggested by the prevailing, unusually low inventory/sales
ratios. But we have reduced somewhat our earlier estimate of second
quarter inventory investment, partly on the basis of the quite moderate
increase in April book values, which apparently reflected to some extent
delays in deliveries.
The rise in wage rates slowed in May after some pick-up in
the two preceding months. Since last November, the hourly earnings
index has increased at a 5.4 per cent annual rate. Recent wage settle-
ments in the rubber and electrical machinery industries on the whole
appear relatively moderate.

I-3
The rise in wholesale prices of farm products and foods
accelerated sharply in May, following a slowing in April. Prices of
industrial commodities rose 1.2 per cent, about the same rapid pace as
in the preceding three months. Increases were widespread among crude
and intermediate materials and finished goods. Over the past 6 months,
the wholesale price index has increased 10 per cent, not at an annual
rate, with prices of farm products and foods up 21.5 per cent and
industrial commodities up over 5 per cent.
Outlook. For the last half of 1973, our GNP projection
continues to assume growth in the monetary aggregates at rates consistent
with longer-term expansion in M1 at about 5-1/4 per cent, and some further
rise in market interest rates from current levels. The assumptions with
respect to Federal expenditures and tax policies remain unchanged.
The Administration is reportedly considering new stabilization actions
but, we have no basis as of this writing for changing our assumptions
as to price and wage restraints.
Increases in both nominal and real GNP in the second half of
the year are now expected to be somewhat smaller than in the projection
of four weeks ago. Real GNP is now projected to rise at an annual rate
of 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, rather than 3.9 per cent.
The rise in the GNP private fixed weight price index is still projected
to slow to a 4.7 per cent annual rate in the fourth quarter.
The downscaling in GNP reflects in part a somewhat smaller
increase than projected five weeks ago in business spending for fixed
capital. The latest Commerce survey taken in May, indicates an increase

I -4
of around 13 per cent in business spending for plant and equipment
this year, about one-half per cent less than in the March survey, and
we have taken this change into account in our current projection. The
Commerce increase is appreciably smaller than indicated by the McGraw-
Hill survey taken a few weeks earlier, but we have discounted most of
this because of several differences between the two surveys. A second
factor in making for a smaller rise in nominal GNP is that with improve-
ment in the trade surplus coming earlier than had been anticipated, a
smaller increase is now projected for the second half.
The accompanying summary table contains projections only
through 1973 but the detailed green tables show staff projections for
the four quarters of 1974. These longer-run projections will be
discussed in the course of the FOMC presentation next week.

Industrial production. Industrial production rose 0.5 per
cent further in May and at 123.4 per cent of the 1967 average it was 9 per
cent above a year earlier. Gains in output were widespread among con-
sumer goods, business equipment, and materials.
Auto assemblies continued at record levels and were at an
annual rate of 10.0 million units. Production schedules for June and
the third quarter are also set at this 10 million unit rate. Production
of some appliances, furniture, and consumer chemical and paper products
increased further. Production of both industrial and commercial equip-
ment increased further but output of trucks remained at about capacity
levels. Production of aircraft also was unchanged but at a reduced level.
Among materials, output of steel and other durable materials was maintained
at record levels while production of textiles, chemicals, and paper rose
further.
Retail sales. Retail sales rose 1.4 per cent in May, according
to the advance report, but April sales have been revised to show a decline
of 2.4 per cent instead of 1.4 per cent first reported. Altogether, retail
sales for May were only 0.6 per cent above the sharply advanced level of
the first quarter. However, they were 12 per cent above May 1972.

Unit sales of consumer durables. Sales of new domestic-
type autos were at a seasonally adjusted 10.1 million unit annual
rate in May, equaling the average of the first 5 months of 1973,
and a tenth above a year earlier. Auto stocks at the end of May
continued low--at a 46 day supply, slightly below a month earlier
and 15 per cent below a year earlier
Foreign car sales in May were at a 1,9 million unit annual
rate, about the same as a month earlier and a fifth above a year ago.
The import share of total sales came to 15.7 per cent, moderately
above a year earlier.
In May, unit factory sales of major appliances, TVs, and
radios are estimated to have fallen slightly below April levels but
were about 14 per cent above a year ago. Seasonally adjusted appli-
ances sales were down 1 per cent from April, with all 9 items in the
index equal to or below a month earlier. A decline in color TV sales
in May was offset by an increase in monochrome sales. Radio sales
continued to decline.

Consumer surveys. The March-April Conference Board report
indicated a sharp drop in consumer optimism, but a surprisingly large
increase in plans to purrchase autos, major appliances and homes within
the next 6 months. Among the attitudinal questions, evaluations of
business and employment conditions during the next 6 months showed the
most deterioration. The proportions of favorable appraisals of
present business and employment conditions also declined from the
previous bimonthly survey, but were still well above a year earlier.
Income expectations drifted downward slightly for the third consecutive
quarterly survey.
In contrast, purchase plans for homes were at a record high
and plans to purchase autos recovered to the high level of the

I -12
September-October survey. (In apparent contradiction to the volume of
actual auto sales in recent quarters, buying plans for autos were
low in the Conference Board survey earlier this year.) Purchase plans
for major appliances were up sharply from the previous survey to the
highest level in over a year.
The increased uneasiness about the future indicated in the
Conference Board survey is consistent with the more pessimistic trend
in attitudes continuously reported by the Michigan Survey Research
Center since last December. In their second quarter survey covering
the April-May period, the index of sentiment declined another 4.8
points to the general level maintained during the 1970 recession.
Attitudes about the trend in personal financial situations and
expectations for business conditions during the next 12 months were
less favorable, and there was also a slight decline in the number of
households who thought that it was "a good time to buy" household
durables. Although this latter question is still at a relatively
high level and indicative of inflationary expectations, this is the
first indication that "buying in advance of price increases" might
become less important. Michigan reported that appraisals of the
market condition for houses and autos turned down more than for house-
hold durables.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place changed little in May from the revised
April level, and was just below the peak which apparently was passed
in March. Outlays for private residential construction dipped for
the second successive month. Among the other major groups, only
outlays for private nonresidential construction were holding at
earlier highs.

Rising construction costs have continued to be an important
factor in the level of current dollar outlays this year. In May, the
composite cost index continued to edge upward -- to 148 per cent of
the 1967 average. On a year-to-year basis, the increase amounted to

I -15
8 per cent as compared with an upward revised increase of about 7
per cent--year-over-year--in the first quarter as well as in 1972 as
a whole.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts dropped 6 per
cent further in April to an annual rate of 2.10 million units. Some
recovery in starts may have occurred in May. Even so, the accelerated
downtrend in residential building permits and other factors indicate
a second quarter average appreciably under the near-record rate of
2,40 million units in the first quarter, with starts of both single-
and multifamily units declining. Meanwhile residential completions,
which lag starts, have continued to rise.

New capital spending plans. The Commerce May survey of
planned spending for new plant and equipment indicates an increase of
13.2 per cent for 1973--down slightly from the Commerce March survey
and substantially below the 19 per cent rise reported in the McGraw-Hill
spring survey. The downward revision in 1973 spending plans from the
March Commerce survey results from a shortfall of $0.5 billion of actual
from planned spending in the first quarter and a scaling down of planned
spending in the second quarter.

The first quarter shortfall occurred in nonmanufacturing and
in nondurable goods manufacturing, while spending by durable goods pro-
ducers just matched plans. Second quarter plans have been revised down-
ward substantially--mainly in nonmanufacturing. There are differences
in compilation that may account for some of the apparent disparity

I -17
between the Commerce and McGraw-Hill surveys. It appears, however, that
this latest Commerce survey may prove to have underestimated somewhat
the strength of business capital spending, especially in manufacturing.
New orders for capital goods have been quite strong and unfilled orders
are rising. Also, newly approved capital appropriations rose 15.5
per cent in the first quarter according to the Conference Board,
supporting the reports of continued strong spending plans by manufacturing
firms. (Historically, appropriations tend to be spent in about two to
three quarters.) Excluding the volatile petroleum industry, the first
quarter rise was 21.7 per cent. Backlogs of unspent appropriations also
rose sharply in the first quarter and could now support spending at
the first quarter rate for another four quarters.
Manufacturers orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods declined 1.5 per cent in April (p) following a 5.6 per cent rise
in March. The April level was 2.7 per cent above the first quarter
average. Nondefense capital goods orders edged off slightly in April
and primary metals orders--mostly for steel--fell by 7.8 per cent after
rising 12.7 per cent in March.
Shipments of durable goods were up sharplyiin April, and
backlogs of unfilled orders continued to increase rapidly, suggesting
further strength in investment.

Inventories. Book value of business inventories rose at an
$8.7 billion annual rate in April (p), down sharply from the first-
quarter average rate of $22.2 billion. The decline from the first
quarter results mainly from a negligible April rate of book value
growth at manufacturing. The April manufacturing figure may reflect
some involuntary decumulation, resulting from continued rapid growth
in sales, but it also appears in part to result from a seasonal
adjustment problem, suggesting that May could well show a resumption
of book value growth at manufacturing.

Cyclical indicators. The preliminary Census composite
index of leading indicators declined 0.6 per cent in April, following
21 straight months of increase at an average monthly rate of more than
1 per cent. The coincident and lagging indexes increased.
The leading index is usually somewhat irregular, so that it
is quite possible that April's mild decline will be reversed when
later data become available. Even if March turns out to have been a

I -21
peak, such a peak--based on past performance--could foreshadow changes
in the economy ranging from a mild slowdown to a full-fledged recession.

Leading series decreasing in April were initial claims for
unemployment insurance (inverted), new orders for durable goods,
contracts and orders for plant and equipment, housing permits, common
stock prices, and the ratio of price to unit labor cost. Series
increasing were the manufacturing workweek and industrial materials
prices.
Since the preliminary April index was compiled, new orders
and contracts and orders have been revised upwards somewhat, but a
decrease was reported in the change in consumer installment debt.
In May, common stock prices and the workweek declined while
industrial materials prices rose further.
Labor market. Growth of employment has moderated in the
past two months following an exceptionally rapid increase which began

I -22
in mid-1971. Total employment and the labor force changed relatively
little in May and the unemployment rate remained at 5 per cent, where
it has held since the start of the year. Insured unemployment and
initial claims for unemployment compensation also have leveled off
since early this year.
Preliminary payroll employment estimates for May show an
increase of 150,000 following a similar gain in April. This compares
with an average monthly increase of about 285,000 in the preceding
ten months. The recent slowing has appeared in all sectors except
construction and State and local government. The number of manu-
facturing jobs in May was little changed, following virtually continuous
growth from December 1971 to April 1973. The factory workweek fell
0.2 hour to 40.8 hours in May, mainly reflecting a sharp cutback in
overtime at transportation equipment producers and widespread
reductions in hours in nondurable goods industries.

Unemployment. The over-all unemployment rate remained unchanged
in May, and there was also little or no change among most major labor
force groups. Over the past year, however, the number of unemployed
persons has decreased by 550,000. All of the decline has been among
persons who lost their jobs--a typical cyclical pattern--while the
number unemployed for other reasons (i.e. labor force entrants, re-
entrants, and job leavers) has remained the same. Job losers comprise
about 36 per cent of all unemployed in May, as compared with 43 per cent
a year ago.

Earnings. The index of hourly earnings of production workers
in the private nonfarm economy rose at a 3.2 per cent annual rate in
May, after larger increases in March and April. The index, which tends
to move unevenly on a monthly basis, was up by 5.7 per cent over the
year ending in May but has risen at a slightly slower rate over the
past six months. Virtually all of the slowing has occurred in the
heavily unionized construction and transportation and public utilities
categories and may partially reflect the irregular timing of contract
settlements. In manufacturing, as well as in the relatively less
unionized trade and service sectors, there has been some speed-up in
the rate of earning increases in the past six months.19731973

Industrial productivity and labor costs. Although in-
dustrial production continued to rise in April and May, gains in
industrial productivity have slowed, and with continuing strong
increases in labor compensation there have been further increases
in industrial unit labor costs. The latter rose at an annual
average rate of about 6.5 per cent, as compensation per manhour
increased at a rate of over 8 per cent and estimated industrial
productivity gains were at a rate of about 1.7 per cent. Compared
with the same period a year ago, labor costs in April-May were up
4.0 per cent with compensation up about 8 per cent and productivity
3.8 per cent.

Minimum wage. The House passed a minimum wage bill June 6
which would raise the nonfarm minimum to $2.20 an hour by 1975, extend
coverage to about 5 million government employees and 1 million domestic
workers, and bring farm workers' minimum wages into parity with non-
agricultural employees over the next four years. The legislation
provides increases for those covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act
before 1966 from $1.60 an hour to $2.00 an hour, effective when signed
into law, and to $2.20 an hour in 1974. For those workers covered by
the 1966 FLSA amendments and those newly covered by the Act, the minimum
wage would increase to $1.80 an hour this year, $2.00 an hour next year,
and $2.20 in 1975.
The House bill does not provide the youth differential wage
which the Administration had recommended and still desires, but would
authorize wages for full time students below the hourly minimum--a
provision considerably milder than sought by the Administration. The
package is estimated by the Labor Department to add directly about $1.5
billion to the wage bill this year, about $1.7 billion next year, $0.7
billion in 1975 and $0.3 billion in 1976. It is also likely to have
repercussions on wage rates above the minimum wage.
In the Senate, hearings began last week on minimum wage
legislation. Although two bills have been introduced, one by Senator
Dominick and one by the Chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, Senator
Williams, the final Senate version is expected to resemble closely the

I -28
Williams version. This measure is very similar to the House-passed
bill in extensions of coverage and increases in the statutory minimum,
and thus in cost. Last year the Senate passed a bill similar to that
introduced this year by Senator Williams.

I -29
Industrial relations. General Electric and the two major
electrical workers' unions reached tentative agreement on a new
contract covering about 100,000 workers. This agreement is scheduled
for a membership vote shortly. Negotiations between the unions and
Westinghouse continue on a day to day basis.
The General Electric settlement could provide an increase in
wages of up to 88 cents, or 22 per cent, over the life of the three
year contract, depending on cost-of-living adjustments. First year
wage adjustments will total about 7.5 per cent a 6.3 per cent increase
retroactive to May 28 and a 1.2 per cent cost-of-living raise guaranteed
on November 26, 1973. In the second and third contract years the
workers could receive up to 7.0 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively
in wage increases. The contract provides a maximum of 14 cents an hour
in cost-of-living adjustments in the second contract year, of which
10 cents an hour is guaranteed, and there is a 12 cents an hour cap
(maximum) on cost-of-living raises in the third year. The escalator
formula provides a 1 cent an hour raise for each 0.3 per cent rise
in the Consumer Price Index. Thus, the maximum payment would require
at least a 4.2 per cent rise in the CPI during the second contract year
and at least a 3.6 per cent increase in the third year.
New fringe benefits provided under the new agreement include
increased pension benefits, retirement at age 62 and supplemental
unemployment compensation. The estimated cost of these benefits is not
yet available.

In other industrial relations developments the United
Rubber Workers ended a three week strike against B. F. Goodrich by
ratifying a new three year contract June 3. The settlement provides
wage increases identical to the moderate increases in the Goodyear
contract which was ratified last month but it differs in providing a
larger increase in fringe benefits. Specifically the Goodrich
settlement increases pensions for those retiring in the first contract
year from $7.75 to $9.50 a month for each year of service, to $9.75 a
month for those retiring in the second contract year and to $10 in the
third year. Goodyear had agreed to an increase of 75 cents to $8.50
for all three years of the contract. The Goodrich agreement also offers
early retirement at age 55 after 30 years of service, but unlike
Goodyear, the Goodrich settlement does not reduce pension benefits
for early retirees.

I -31
Consumer prices. Consumer prices climbed further in April--
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nearly 8 per cent--to a level
about 5 per cent above April 1972. Food prices continued to rise
extremely rapidly while advances for other commodities accelerated
to an annual rate of 5 per cent. Service costs continued to increase
at the first quarter rate.

A further large increase in meat prices although less
spectacular than in previous months, contributed to the climb in food
costs as did substantial advances for most food groups, particularly
fresh fruits and vegetables and eggs. Retail food prices in May may
rise more moderately, in view of the small increase that month at
wholesale. In the following months, although meat prices will be restrained
by ceiling levels further substantial advances are likely for many other
foods including eggs processed fruits and vegetables, coffee, bakery
products and perhaps broilers.
The acceleration of price rises for other commodities is
seen more clearly in the series excluding used cars and home purchase,
this series has increased since January at a rate of about 6 per cent
compared with 2 per cent during 1972. Apparel and gasoline were of
major importance in the recent advance, and household durables and new
cars rose substantially in April.
Among services, rents were up less in April than in the
previous three months but this was offset by larger increases for
medical and other service costs. When costs associated with home-
ownership--mainly mortgage interest and property taxes--are excluded
from services, the rate of rise since January shows a marked acceleration
to 4.6 per cent, in contrast to 3.3 per cent during 1972. This
reflects the recent advances in rents as well as a faster rise in most
other services.

Wholesale prices, Wholesale prices rose 2 per cent between

Price increases were widespread as prices for farm and food products

modities continued to rise at a very rapid pace for the fourth con-
secutive month.
In the first four months of Phase III, the WPI increased
more than three times as fast as in Phase II.

In May the index of farm and food products increased 4.1

sharply higher prices were posted for manufactured animal feeds,

I -34
soybeans, grains, cotton, fluid milk, and fats and oils. Declines
were few, but included somewhat lower prices for meat, poultry, and
dairy products.
Prices of industrial commodities rose 1.2 per cent, 15.5 per
cent at a seasonally adjusted rate. Of major influence were increases
for fuels and electric power, metals and metal products, lumber and
wood products, machinery, and textile products. Since mid-May, the
BLS raw industrial materials index has continued to move higher with
prices of scrap metals and raw cotton and wool tops of particular
importance. Some strengthening, perhaps temporary, in prices of lumber
and plywood products has been noted recently, but prices are not
expected to return to their recent peaks. The increase in prices of
steel sheet and strip expected by producers to be effective in mid-June,
if permitted by the Cost of Living Council, will be reflected in the
July WPI. A major producer of copper has increased its price and
another has requested approval of a sizable price increase.
Although the increase in consumer foods last month was the
smallest in about a year, other consumer goods continued to rise at a
high rate, reflecting advances for heating fuel, apparel, gasoline,
passenger cars, jewelry, and carpets.
Producer finished goods rose at a rapid rate for the fourth
consecutive month, reflecting higher seasonally adjusted prices for
machinery and equipment, metal commercial furniture, and motor vehicles.

Agriculture. After substantial increases during the month
ending May 15, prices of cattle, corn and soybeans have continued their
rise into early June, and eggs, broilers, hogs and wheat have also
turned upward. During the first week in June, prices of the major feed
items, corn and soybeans, reached levels two and three times those in
November 1972.
High prices of feedstuff result from heavy demand, limited
stocks, and prospects for a continued tight situation, at least for
corn, in the new crop year. With planting not quite complete, an
early estimate of corn production is 5.9 million bushels, 7 per cent
above last year but 5 per cent less than had been hoped for earlier.
If no further delays occur in soybean planting, now half complete, the
crop may be relatively ample at 1.5 million bushels, 11 per cent above
last year.
Harvest of the excellent winter wheat crop has begun and
production is expected to be 11 per cent above last year. Exports of
the new crop will probably be as large as the 1972 crop; world demand
is likely to keep prices strong.
Red meat production increased moderately in May from the
sharp boycott-associated April decline. But output was still 6 per cent
below the January-March level reflecting partly large winter death
losses of cattle and pigs. Slaughter volume is running below expecta-
tions based on recent surveys of the livestock numbers on farms and feed-
lots, so there has been increased doubt concerning the validity of the
survey data. In addition to the reduced volume of red meat production,
supplies of broilers, eggs, and milk are below the levels of last year
and are not expected to expand until the feed supply and price situation
improves.

of Agriculture have underscored the boom in farm land prices and transfer
activity. The national index of farm real estate prices on March 1 was
13 per cent higher than a year earlier (confidential until publication
about June 18), sharply above the average annual gain of 5.8 per cent
during the preceding 10 years. Price strength was widespread, with
only four states showing increases of less than 10 per cent.
The total value of farm land transferred in the year ending
March 1, 1973 was $10.6 billion, far above the former record of $6.8
billion set the preceding year. Eighty-six per cent of the transfers
involved credit financing, and in these sales the debt averaged 78 per
cent of purchase price--both new highs for these series. (Confidential
until publication in late July.)
Department of Agriculture analysts state that the land boom
reflects several factors: rising farm income since 1970; readily
available mortgage credit, particularly from Federal Land Banks, at
stable interest rates; and the accelerated movement of land into nonfarm
recreation and housing uses. Of the farm real estate brokers, bankers,
and other reporters surveyed on March 1, 71 per cent expected price
increases exceeding 5 per cent during the next 12 months, compared to
48 per cent a year earlier.
Demand for farm production loans has been strong this spring,
as expected in view of the Department of Agriculture estimate that
farm production expenses will be $6 billion, or 12 per cent, higher than

I -38
in 1972. Through April, new loans at production credit associations were
running 24 per cent above last year; however, repayments have continued
strong, and outstanding volume on May 1 was only 9 per cent above a
year earlier. Loans at rural banks are also up, but these banks generally
continue in a relatively liquid position as rising farm income has
swelled deposits.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Short-term interest rates have been under considerable upward
pressure since the last Committee meeting, largely in reflection of
recent monetary policy actions. Treasury bill rates have shown the
largest increases as the supply of bills to be absorbed by nonbank
investors has been augmented by Federal Reserve operations, foreign
central bank activity, and commercial bank liquidation of bills in
order to meet loan demands. With private short-term credit demands
remaining strong, other short-term market rates -- including the
prime rate -- have increased about 50 basis points in the intra-meeting
period.
In longer-term markets corporate bond rates have risen 25
basis points, while yields on tax exempts have been essentially
unchanged. In May, yields on home mortgages in the primary market
edged higher, with reports of reduced credit availability and more
restrictive commitment policies associated with continued reduced
deposit inflows to nonbank thrift institutions. Yields in the FNMA
auction of FHA/VA loans have been rising steadily since the first of
the year, advancing about 35 basis points over this period.
Bank credit during May expanded rapidly, with all loan
categories strong. Despite the cessation of run-offs of dealer
placed commercial paper by nonfinancial corporations, business loan
expansion continued to be quite rapid.

II -2
Outlook. The near-term outlook for interest rates depends
importantly on the content of any new Administration initiative in the
wage-price area. Over the longer-run, though with nominal GNP growth
continuing to be relatively strong as projected, interest rates are
expected to be under further upward pressure, assuming moderate growth
in the monetary aggregate.
The spread between the bill rate and the Federal funds rate
is still quite large, despite sharp increases in the bill rate in
recent weeks, suggesting further increases ahead. Early in the summer,
when the Treasury is not expected to be a significant factor in the
market, bill rate increases could once again be moderated by a relatively
scarce supply of bills. But borrowing by housing and other agencies
and Treasury asset sales are expected to be sizable. Private credit
demands in short-term markets are also expected to be strong, and CD
and commercial paper rates -- as well as the bank prime rate -- seem
likely to remain under upward pressure.
Longer-term market rates have continued to fluctuate in a
quite narrow range despite increases of 2 to 3 percentage points in
money market rates in the last six months. During this period, cor-
porations have relied heavily on short-term sources of credit and
their own cash flows to finance their activities. No significant
shift in financing patterns are apparent at this time, but there are
reports that some investment nankers have been counseling corporations

II -3
to accelerate their planned capital market borrowings on the expecta-
tion that fundamental economic factors are leading toward higher
long-term rates.
There have been some indications of commercial bank efforts
to limit loan expansion and some unconfirmed reports that borrowers
who shifted their financing from the commercial paper market to banks
in the spring are being asked, as these loans mature, to pay them down.
Such policies would bring upward rate pressures on the commercial paper
market and -- to the extent that they contribute to a shift toward
capital market financing -- on longer-term rates as well.
Residential mortgage activity is likely to continue to moderate
in line with the reduced inflow of funds to thrift institutions --
assuming no change in the regulatory ceiling on deposit rates. Savings
and loan association borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks --
already large -- is expected to rise further this summer, contributing
to sustained borrowing by that Agency at a time when borrowing by FNMA
and other housing credit agencies is also expected to remain large. In
this environment, the combination of State usury and FHA/VA rate
ceilings can be expected to result in a step-up in the non-price
rationing of new residential mortgage credit. CID restraints are also
working in that direction, at least insofar as banks are concerned.

II -4
Monetary aggregates. Preliminary data indicate that M1 increased
at a 10.7 per cent annual rate in May, bringing the growth rate for the
April-May period close to that of the fourth quarter of 1972. Some acceler-
ation in M1 growth was to be expected in the second quarter in light of
the continued strong pace of economic activity and the unusually slow
growth in the first quarter. In April and May, however, large income
tax refunds may have contributed temporarily to the more rapid growth of
demand balances. Growth in M2 accelerated in May to about a 10 per cent
annual rate. While this acceleration reflected solely the faster growth
in M1, inflows of time deposits other than large CD's have remained sur-
prisingly strong despite increasingly higher yields available on competing
market instruments.
The larger M2 growth in May than in April was offset by a
smaller increase in net sales of negotiable CD's and a decline in U.S.
Government deposits, seasonally adjusted; as a result, the adjusted bank
credit proxy slowed to an 11.5 per cent annual rate of growth.
The $3 billion increase in net sales of CD's in May was almost
$1 billion below the average increase over the preceding four months.
This slower growth apparently reflected both the larger volume of maturing
CD's and the reluctance of some banks to pay the increasingly higher costs
needed to sustain the net inflows at the rapid pace of previous months.
Even though banks were free to bid for longer-term CD's after suspension
of the ceilings on May 16--and the offering rates on such instruments
increased 25 to 75 basis points from their below-market levels--prelim--
inary data suggest that the average maturity of CD's sold over the entire
month remained essentially unchanged from that in April.

As growth in CD's decelerated in May, banks obtained addi-
tional funds by liquidating $1 billion in Treasury security holdings.
They also raised approximately $300 million from non-deposit sources--
primarily through issuance of bank related commercial paper, but also
through increased Eurodollar borrowings. Since the beginning of the
year, however, funds obtained from non-deposit sources have increased
by only $1 billion, as rate differentials have made these funds generally
more expensive than funds acquired through CD sales.
Bank credit. Following moderate growth in April, total loans
and investments of commercial banks (last Wednesday-of-the-month series,
seasonally adjusted) expanded at a 22 per cent annual rate in May, above
the very strong first quarter pace. Most of the increase in bank credit
reflected a sharp expansion in loans, although, for the first time this
year, there was also a sizable increase in bank holdings of "other"
securities, primarily State and local tax warrants and agency issues
acquired late in the month. The increase in "other" securities was
partially offset by a large reduction in bank portfolios of Treasury
securities.
A sharp expansion in loans to non-bank financial institutions
in May in part reflected increased borrowing by finance companies, apparent-
ly induced by both the favorable spread between bank rates and commercial
paper rates and the high level of consumer credit demands. At the same
time, finance companies continued to add substantially to the volume of
their directly-placed commercial paper outstanding. Borrowings at banks
by other non-bank financial institutions, which have been extremely
high all year, showed another large gain in May. In a special Reserve

Bank survey, several large commercial banks indicated that real estate
investment trusts had been drawing more heavily on bank lines of
credit rather than using commercial paper because of relative rate
considerations. Also, some respondents reported an increase in
short-term credit to mortgage companies to finance increased inven-
tories. Only a few banks reported that savings and loan associations
had increased their bank borrowing as a result of reduced deposit inflows.
Business loans in May increased at a 25 per cent annual rate.
For the first time in several months, the rapid expansion in business
borrowing at banks was not associated with a shift out of commercial
paper financing, as shown in the table, thus indicating continued strong
short-term credit demands by business. Faced with heavy loan demands
and rapidly increasing costs of funds, banks in recent weeks have
begun to implement more stringent lending practices. Under the new
CID guidelines, the prime loan rate charged large corporations was
adjusted upward three times in one-quarter point steps from 6-3/4 at
the end of April to 7-1/2 per cent in early June. Furthermore, the
April 15th Quarterly Survey of Changes in Bank Lending Practices in-
dicates a general across-the-board tightening of non-price lending
practices by banks, including more careful screening of applicants,
greater reluctance to make term loans, and stricter compensating
balance requirements. In addition, a survey of loan commitments taken
at selected large U.S. banks revealed a greater reluctance by respondents
to extend new loan commitments; in the three month survey period ending
in mid-April, there was no increase in the volume of outstanding com-
mitments at these banks. A more detailed analysis of the results of
these surveys will be presented in the forthcoming Supplement.

Nonbank financial institutions. Revised data indicate that deposit
growth in April at savings and loan associations was at an annual rate
of 7.2 per cent--somewhat higher than originally estimated. Sample data
for May show a continuation of reduced deposit flows relative to the
first quarter, although deposit growth was slightly stronger than in
April. The large volume of tax refunds disbursed in April and May--
more than double the amount refunded a year ago--may have bolstered
recent inflows to the savings and loans.
Analysis of S&L balance sheet data for April, the latest avail-
able, provides some insight into recent developments. For the first

II -10
time in over a year, deposits held in passbook accounts decreased con-
siderably, while certificate accounts continued to attract additional
funds. Moreover, reflecting the slowdown in deposit growth together
with increased seasonal demand for takedowns of mortgage commitments,
S&Ls increased their borrowings substantially in April. Net advances
from the FHLB Banks increased by $1 billion and borrowings from other
sources rose by $0.4 billion. However, there was little change in liquid
asset holdings during April, with the ratio of liquid assets to savings
and short-term borrowings at about 9.4 per cent for insured S&Ls--
moderately above the 7 per cent legally required at that time. In
early May, the FHLBB reduced this required ratio to 6.5 per cent, and
indications are that some associations drew down liquid assets during
the month. In addition, borrowings from the Home Loan Banks rose by
about $700 million. Since the beginning of 1973, these borrowings
have increased by over $2 billion, with the level of advances out-
standing topping $10 billion at the end of May.
The 5 per cent annual growth rate previously estimated for mutual
savings banks in April appears to have been confirmed by more recent
reports. Preliminary data for May indicate that deposit growth slowed
further. Savings banks located in financial centers (particularly New
York City) fared less favorably than their suburban counterparts, but
over-all savings flows were down sharply from a year ago.

Consumer credit. The April increase in total consumer credit
outstanding amounted to $20.9 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate, considerably less than the $25.7 billion average annual rate of
growth during the preceding six months but still high by historical
standards.
Slowing from March was most pronounced in instalment credit,
where extensions declined and repayments again rose. Growth in auto-
mobile credit slowed along with auto sales, and large income tax refunds
apparently dampened the rise in personal instalment loans. Other instal-
ment consumer goods credit and charge account balances showed larger
increases than in March.
Finance rates on consumer instalment loans have shown little
net change in recent months despite substantial increases in most other
market interest rates. For example, rates on new car contracts pur-
chased by the major automobile finance companies, although up 3 basisBoth

points in April to 11.88 per cent, were about unchanged from the year-
earlier level. At commercial banks, rates on direct loans for new car
purchases remained about unchanged in May at levels near those prevail-
ing since last summer.
The gradual trend toward longer maturities on new car contracts
may have been accelerated by the dip in auto sales during April, At
finance companies, 2.3 per cent of the new car contracts had maturities
over 36 months, up slightly from March and considerably above the 0.7
per cent in April 1972. The weighted average maturity for all new car
contracts acquired by the major auto finance companies reached a new
high of 35.2 months in April.
Short-term markets. The marked further tightening of money
market conditions since the May meeting has been reflected in steep
rate advances on short-term market securities. The yield on 3-month
Treasury bills--which had been unusually depressed relative to the
rest of the short-term rate structure--has risen nearly a full per-
centage point to around 7-1/8 per cent, and rates on other short-term
instruments have advanced 50-70 basis points. Most of the rate in-
creases occurred before the June 11 hike in the System's discount rate
to 6-1/2 per cent. The relatively mild market response to the discount
rate change was attributable, in part, to widespread anticipation of
imminent Administration moves to strengthen wage-price controls.
The rise in bill rates relative to other short term rates
developed partly because earlier shortages in the market supply of
bills were alleviated. The concentration of three Treasury bill auc-
tions in the last week of May (the regular weekly and monthly auctions,

II -13
plus a pre-holiday weekly auction) added substantially to dealer posi-
tions, particularly because bidding by other investors was cautious in
the face of tightening money market conditions. In addition, a sharp
decline in the Treasury's balance was in progress and this led to the
System supplying bills to absorb reserves. In the last week of May
the Desk sold almost $200 million of bills into the market and ran-off
$600 million of bills in the auctions. At the same time commercial
banks and foreign official accounts were adding to market bill supplies.
In general, when foreign official accounts were selling bills their orders
(amounting to some $680 million) were executed in the market, but when
these accounts were buying bills the Desk met such orders (totaling
$330 million) directly out of the System's Account. Taken together,
this combination of influences swelled dealer inventories substantially
at a time when their financing costs were also rising, and this con-
tributed importantly to the general rise in bill rates. More recently,
market expectations of some strengthening of the wage-price control
program, the imminent redemption of June tax bills, and the projected
absence through July of Treasury financing have all contributed to a
stabilization of bill yields. Moreover, the current higher yields on
shorter than on longer maturity bills may indicate that the market is
expecting that short rates are near their peaks.
The general intensification of monetary pressure over the intra-
meeting period was also evident in the markets for negotiable bank CD's
and commercial paper. Bank offering rates on CD's with 3-6 month
maturities moved up to about 8 per cent while the 90-119 day com-
mercial paper rate rose to 7-7/8 per cent. With corporate tax

II -14
liabilities large in June and the amount of maturing tax bills out-
standing smaller than usual, it is possible that tax (and dividend)
payments out of maturing CD's and bank loans could be sizable. Facing
such a prospect, many banks have raised CD offering rates in order to
minimize the impact of possible CD run-offs. Reflecting the higher
cost of funds and continued strong demand for credit some banks have
also raised the prime rate on business loans to 7.50 per cent.

Long-term private securities markets. Yields on long-term
corporate securities have begun to advance in recent weeks, in
response to sharp advances in short-term rates and the consequent
rising cost of financing dealer inventories, the weakening of the
dollar, continued evidence of inflation, and a potential increase in
long-term borrowing by corporations. The FRB index of yields on newly
issued Aaa utility bonds rose almost one-quarter of a percentage
point since the May Greenbook, while market yields on recently offered
bonds increased 14 basis points on balance over this period. The
rise in the latter index would have been greater but for a brief and
vigorous rally in the middle of last week which was sparked by
expectations of action by the Administration on additional anti-
inflationary measures.

Public bond volume in June has picked up to an estimated $1.3
billion, primarily because of a build-up in the utility calendar,
but total public offerings for the second quarter as a whole have been
contraseasonally low. On the basis of present scheduling, the staff
estimates that the July total will be less than $1 billion. However,
there is a potential for sudden growth in the calendar. Many invest-
ment bankers now expect long-term interest rates to rise over the
rest of the year and are encouraging borrowers with 1973 needs to
accelerate their issues. Should prices and interest rates continue
to rise substantially, the build-up in the corporate calendar could
be large.

commitment policy might tighten later in the year should cash flows
come under pressure from rising policy loans, which recently showed an
upturn. New equity issues appear to be tending down. The staff
estimates that June volume will be about $900 million, and July
volume probably will be considerably lower. In addition to the usual
summer slackening in new issues, scheduled issues by utilities for
that month are light.
The decline in corporate stock offerings appears to reflect
in part general deterioration in equity markets. Offerings of shares
by bond funds have been smaller than in the first quarter, and a
number of smaller companies have postponed issues because of the
prolonged slump in stock market prices. Stock prices fluctuated
widely during May and June but on balance declined. Most recently,
however, prices have moved up, as in bond markets, reflecting
anticipations of strengthened price control measures. Volume on the
major exchanges has been light.
Yields on long-term,tax-exempt bonds have edged up only 3
basis points on balance since the May Greenbook. The total volume of
new issues has tapered somewhat in the second quarter, with the volume
of general obligation bonds declining more rapidly than the total.
Commercial banks, which are the principal purchasers of general
obligation bonds, have been able to absorb this reduced volume readily.

While casualty companies are reported to be somewhat more selective in
their buying in recent weeks, they continue to make heavy purchases of
longer-term bonds and revenue offerings.

Mortgage market. Lenders appear to have cut back new commit-
ments for home mortgages somewhat further during the past few weeks,
according to trade reports. These sources suggest that S&L's in
particular have reduced their mortgage purchases in the secondary market
and have concentrated their lending on established customers, due to
uncertainties about future net savings inflows and to the exceptionally
large volume of mortgage commitments outstanding. By the end of April
(latest available data), the backlog of mortgage commitments (including
loans in process) at insured S&L's totaled a near record $21 billion--
equivalent to about 4 months of S&L lending, as measured by the volume
of loans either closed or purchased in April.
Interest rates on home mortgages in the primary market appear
to have been edging higher. Effective yields on conventional first
mortgages closed during early May averaged 7.72 per cent for new-home
loans (up 1 basis point from early April) and 7.77 per cent for existing-
home loans (up 7 basis points), according to the FHLBB series. The
extent of the increase in average credit costs in this sector has been
restrained in part by expanded GNMA purchases of certain FHA/VA mortgages
at prices designed to limit the number of discount points paid by sellers,
and by usury ceilings that have begun to inhibit high loan-to-value ratio
lending on conventional mortgages.1/
1/ Fourteen States, mainly in the East and South, have 8 per cent usury
ceilings, and 4 others have 7-1/2 per cent ceilings. These usury
limits generally are applicable only to conventional home mortgages.

II -21
In the secondary market, yields on home mortgages have continued
to increase, judging by FNMA's auction of its forward purchase commit-
ments for Government underwritten loans that are too large in size to
qualify for GNMA discount subsidy.2/ The average yield on these FHA/VA
loan commitments in the latest bi-weekly auction (June 11) was 8.04
per cent, up 4 basis points from the preceding auction and the highest
level since July 1971. The yield in FNMA's associated auction of high-
ratio, privately-insured conventional mortgage commitments has been
somewhat higher (8.44 per cent on June 11), although offerings have
remained relatively small.
2/ Under its so-called Super Tandem Plan, GNMA stands ready to purchase
regular FHA and VA mortgages of $22,000 or less ($24,500 if 4 bed-
rooms or more) at 96 (new homes) or 95 (existing homes).

Federal finance. In its mid-session review of the 1974
budget, released on June 1, the Administration projects unified budget
deficits of $17.8 billion for the current fiscal year and $2.7 billion
for fiscal year 1974. These estimates are respectively $7 billion and
$10 billion smaller than those presented in the January budget. The
revisions are due entirely to higher estimates for receipts, which are
now set at $232 billion for fiscal 1973 and $266 billion for fiscal 1974.
Most of the revenue increases are in personal and corporate
income taxes. For 1974, estimates of revenues from each of these sources
have been raised by $4.5 billion, partly because of larger expected
growth in personal income and corporate profits, and partly because
experience with tax collections thus far this year suggests that receipts
at a given level of GNP are higher than previously estimated. There
have been some minor changes in the projected composition of spending,
but no change has been made in total estimated outlays of $249.8 billion
for fiscal year 1973 and $268.7 billion for fiscal year 1974.
Current Board staff projections differ little from the mid-
year budget review. For fiscal 1973 our receipts estimate is $500
million higher and our unified budget deficit consequently lower. On
the expenditure side we have not changed our fiscal year 1973 forecast.
It should be noted, however, that in earlier years shifts in the timing
of expenditures between June and July have often produced unanticipated
changes in the fiscal year total amounting to as much as $2 billion.

II -23
For fiscal 1974, we are forecasting receipts $3.8 billion
larger than the Administration estimate, due mainly to higher corporate
income tax projections; but our expenditure forecast also exceeds that
of the Administration, by $1 billion, because we are assuming the
release of some impounded funds for grants to States and local governments.
The staff is now projecting a high employment budget deficit
(NIA basis) of $4.5 billion for the current fiscal year and a surplus of
$1.1 billion for fiscal year 1974. The extended outlook, as shown by
our half-year projections in the following table, indicates a steadily
increasing move toward restraint through calendar year 1974. The
Administration's revised estimates--which are on a unified budget basis
and hence differ from the NIA approach in regard to timing and coverage--
also indicate a shift toward surplus from this fiscal year to the next.

The end-of-May Treasury cash balance was $8.2 billion, $0.6
billion less than we had projected in the May Greenbook. Refund checks
issued in May were about $2 billion higher than we had estimated,
raising total refunds for the month to about $6.6 billion. However,
refunds in June are falling off more sharply than we had projected, and
it now looks as if total refunds for the year will be about $22 billion,
$1 billion more than estimated in the May Greenbook. (Some of the
large May refunds, however, were being cashed early in June.)
Given our projected pattern of outlays and receipts, it now
appears likely that the Treasury will need $1 to $2 billion in additional
funds during August, either in the form of net cash borrowing or by
monetizing the capital gains obtained from the revaluation of gold.
A factor that might provide some pressure to hold down the size of
Treasury borrowing during the summer and fall is the adoption by the
Ways and Means Committee of a five-month extension of the $465 billion
debt limit ceiling. This ceiling is $20 billion lower than that requested
by the Administration. If enacted, it will encourage the Treasury to
aim for low levels in its cash balance and, perhaps, to defer some
outlays and schedule additional asset sales.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. In the past month there have again been
flurries of speculation against the dollar. The dollar has depreciated
against a weighted average of major currencies by almost 3-1/2 percent
since May 9. The market has responded nervously to news of political
difficulties and continuing rapid inflation in the United States, and
exchange rates fluctuated widely. The German mark, in particular, has
been under upward pressure, strengthened by a severe tightening of
monetary and fiscal policy and a rising trade surplus.
Helping to support the dollar during May was the report of
a sharply better U.S. trade balance for April; together with the
generally better trade results for the first quarter, the improving
trend seemed to confirm the view that the devaluations would have a
substantial effect. Contrary to earlier expectations, agricultural
exports seem likely to remain high for quite some time, though they may
slow between crop years. Improvement in the U.S. trade balance is being
facilitated by an accelerated expansion of trade generally, as a broad
upswing in world demand generates gains in both volume and value terms.
The pattern of trade shifts that is emerging tends to support the
impression that the exchange rate changes are pushing trade balances
in an equilibrating direction. The main exception seems to be the
growing German trade surplus.
For the month of April the official settlements balance
registered a surplus of about $700 million -- mainly reflecting

III -2
market intervention and investment of reserves by Japan. In May the
speculation that developed was reflected almost entirely in the
appreciation of other currencies against the dollar -- there was perhaps
a small deficit on the official settlements basis for the month. Such
data as are available do not suggest major capital outflows from the
United States in April or May. Foreign investors purchased, net, about
$140 million of U.S. corporate stocks in April, and reportedly were also
on the buying side in May. Bank-reported claims on foreigners were up
moderately in April -- by about $200 million -- and weekly data do not
indicate a significant outflow in May.
Relatively complete data now being compiled for the first-
quarter balance of payments show a surprisingly large jump in outflows
by U.S. direct investors at that time, probably involving flows of funds
to affiliates to enable them to hedge against exchange rate movements.
This was partly offset by a rise in income receipts and inflows of
foreign investment capital. There apparently were large net unrecorded
outflows for the quarter.
Although the appreciation of some exchange rates against the
dollar since early May has been considerable, the movement of rates
tended to head off cumulative speculation, suggesting that the market
was not convinced that rates were greatly out of line. It seems that
sentiment could readily shift in favor of the dollar if further strong
actions are taken against inflation in the United States and the trade
figures continue to indicate that the realignments are working as
expected,

III -3
Foreign exchange markets. The dollar came under strong selling
pressures in May, principally against the currencies of the European snake.
Nearly all of this pressure, at least against the currencies of the other
G-10 countries and Switzerland, was reflected in a decline in exchange rates
for the dollar, rather than central bank intervention. The dollar depre-
ciated by some 3-1/2 per cent on a weighted average basis against those
currencies between early May and early June. Against the snake currencies,
the depreciation averaged about 7 per cent.
Against the background of growing concern over the U.S. "energy
crisis" and the emergence of Watergate as a cause celebre, the dollar
weakened in early May when rumors circulated in the markets that a part
of the then forthcoming German anti-inflation package would be a revalua-
tion of the mark. Subsequently, the concern over the political and economic
outlook in the United States, fueled by continuing new revelations in the
Watergate investigations and accelerating U.S. inflation, came to the fore
as factors in the dollar's weakness. The dollar was buoyed on May 24 and
25 by the release of favorable U.S. trade figures, but this rally was
short-lived. A further tightening of monetary policy in Germany at the
end of May put additional pressure on the dollar. In recent days the
dollar has held fairly steady pending the expected announcement of new
anti-inflation measures in the United States.
During much of the latter part of May and early June, market
conditions were quite hectic, some would say "disorderly." Rates moved
over a range of as much as two per cent on several days, apparently on

III -4
little volume. In recent days, however, rate movements have been fairly
small, with the dollar moderately above its lows of early June.

The European band did not experience any severe strains in May
as the snake currencies moved up and down in general uniformity. The
Netherlands Bank did have to sell moderate amounts of European currencies
to support the guilder. After the German discount rate increase on May 30,
the German mark began firming relative to its European partner currencies,
and currently is at the top of the band. On June 12, the guilder required
a substantial amount of central bank support against the mark, perhaps
as much as $50 million equivalent.
While the dollar showed its largest declines against the European
band currencies, it showed relatively small changes vis-a-vis sterling
and the yen, in part because of central bank intervention. The pressure
on the dollar in Japan was reflected in a cessation of Bank of Japan
sales of dollars, which had been very heavy from mid-March through early
May and had kept the yen appreciated above levels it would otherwise

III -5
have reached. In the case of sterling, the Bank of England purchased
some $300 million during May in market intervention and added another
$300 million to its reserves from direct conversions of Euro-dollar
borrowings by local authorities in the United Kingdom.
The gold market experienced an orgy of speculative fervor in May
and early June, reflecting the worldwide concern over the U.S. political
and economic situation and, indeed, rampant world inflation. The price
in London rose from $90.70 on May 1 to a peak of $127.00 on June 5 before
falling back to around $117.00 on June 13.
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates have firmed over
the past four weeks under the influence of a general increase in interest
rates both in the United States and abroad. The widespread nature of this
increase in rates is indicated by the number of countries whose central
banks announced discount rate increases during this period. These
included Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, Canada and the United States.
The increases in Euro-dollar rates during the past month have not been
as large as the increases in U.S. market rates of comparable maturity.
The excess of rates on one- and three-month Euro-dollar deposits over
comparable U.S. CD rates averaged less than 1/2 percentage point in the
week ended June 13 compared to nearly 1 percentage point in the week ended
May 16. The overnight Euro-dollar rate has been below the Federal funds
rate almost continuously over the past four weeks, by an average of nearly

U.S. balance of payments. The overall balance on the official
settlement basis in May is estimated to have been slightly in deficit;
in April there was a surplus of $700 million. While there was renewed
pressure on the dollar during May, there was only limited market
intervention by foreign central banks. The pressure on the dollar was
therefore largely reflected in exchange rate changes, with the dollar
depreciating by about 3-1/2 percent against major currencies on the
average.
The liabilities of U.S. agencies and branches of foreign
banks increased substantially (by about $700 million) in May as
overnight interest rates abroad were below the Federal funds rate.
Liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches also increased
in May -- by about $300 million.
Foreign purchases of U.S. stocks dipped in April to a net
of $140 million, compared with a monthly average of over $400 million
in the first quarter. In view of the weakness in the U.S. stock
market and concern about the dollar, these purchases still appear
quite strong. Net purchases in May are expected to be close to the
April level and brokers report a pickup in purchases in the early part
of June. However sales of U.S. bonds (mainly Eurobond issues) to
private foreigners dropped off sharply in May, following a strong
showing in the first four months of the year.

III -8
U.S. bank-reported claims on foreigners increased about
$200 million in April, mainly in export credits which are exempt
from the VFCR program. Claims subject to the program declined.
Weekly data for May indicate only a small increase in bank claims
on foreigners in that month.
A full set of accounts for the first quarter balance of
payments is still not available but early estimates have been made
for some major items. Receipts of income and fees from direct
investments abroad appear to have been particularly strong, generating
a surplus in the service component about large enough to offset the
trade deficit for the quarter. (Figures shown in the standard tables
in this Greenbook do not yet reflect this information.) In the
capital accounts, the outstanding feature seems to have been a sharp
rise in outflows of direct investment capital to well over $2 billion,
compared with a quarterly average of about $800 million last year.
On the other hand, there was a moderate inflow of foreign capital
for direct investment in the United States, in addition to the
sizable inflows to purchase American securities which had already
been apparent in the monthly data. It still appears that there were
substantial net outflows from the United States that were unrecorded
and that the negative errors and omissions for the first quarter
was roughly $4 billion.

III -9
U.S. foreign trade. In April the United States had a trade
surplus of $2 billion at an annual rate (balance of payments basis)
the first monthly surplus in about a year and a half. This followed
a large improvement in March, when the trade deficit dropped to a
deficit rate of less than $1 billion. For the first four months of
1973 the trade balance was a deficit of $2-1/4 billion at an annual
rate, compared with deficits of $6-3/4 billion in the fourth quarter
of 1972 and in calendar 1972.
The improved U.S. trade position this year -- particularly
in March and April -- stemmed from a combination of continuing large
advances in exports while imports, which had also increased very
sharply in January, leveled off in February-March and then declined
in April. Exports in January-April were at an annual rate of
$62-1/4 billion, 18 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 1972;
imports were at a rate of $64-1/2 billion, 8 percent over the fourth
quarter rate. The values of both exports and imports have been buoyed
by rising prices. Import prices accelerated very sharply in April,
rising by over 5 percent from March, largely a reflection of the
February devaluation. The volume of exports has expanded, particularly
in March and April, while the volume of imports has trended downward
since January.
Shipments of agricultural products accounted for about one-
half of the increase in the total value of exports from the fourth

III -10
quarter of 1972 to the first four months of this year. In April,
however, although the value of agricultural exports held at a $16 billion
annual rate (compared with less than $11 billion in the fourth quarter),
the volume of such exports fell for the first time since last
September because of supply limitations, mainly of soybeans. Further
rises in prices of agricultural exports are expected to offset to a
considerable degree any temporary decline in the volume of exports of
agricultural commodities until new crops become available.
Although overshadowed by the spectacular rise in agricultural
exports, nonagricultural exports have also increased sharply this
year. With foreign economic activity on the rise, particularly in
Japan and Europe, exports of machinery and nonagricultural industrial
materials have been exceptionally strong. While foreign orders for
U.S. machinery fell quite sharply in April, the level of such orders
remains high and the backlog continues to grow. Exports of nonfood
consumer goods (other than automobiles), small and relatively stable
in the past, have also been strong in January-April, rising by
15 percent over the value of exports in the fourth quarter to a level
nearly $1 billion greater (at an annual rate) than in calendar 1972.
The increase in these exports was widespread by commodities, including
both durable and nondurable types, and to all major areas.
The flattening in the value of imports since January is
particularly pronounced in industrial materials (other than fuels)

III -11
and consumer goods (other than automobiles). The slowdown in imports
of industrial materials -- paper, lumber, steel and nonferrous metals --
is puzzling in view of the upsurge in domestic economic activity in
the first quarter. One possible explanation is that the world-wide
economic boom has resulted in some supply shortages abroad. It is
also possible, of course, that inventories of these imported goods
had been built up in January and earlier months with a subsequent
slowdown in imports while inventory holdings were being reduced.
The downturn in imports of consumer goods (other than autos) may be
related to the increasing effectiveness of the Smithsonian realignment.
Imports of foreign cars (in numbers) have been generally
flat, and have been below the level of U.S. sales of these cars
since December 1972. This has resulted in a sizable reduction in
inventories. To the extent that there is need to replenish inventories
of imported materials, cars and other imported products, particularly
in view of the projected continued strength in domestic economic
activity through the third quarter, imports can be expected to rise
somewhat in the coming months.
The improved over-all trade balance so far this year has
resulted from a more favorable trade balance with the developed
countries, particularly Japan. The trade deficit with Japan in
January-April was down to an annual rate of a little over $2 billion,
compared with rates of over $4 billion in each quarter of 1972.

III -12
In March-April the deficit shrank further to a $1 billion rate. Exports
to Japan have risen steeply -- particularly agricultural products and
industrial materials -- while imports from Japan have leveled off,
with significant slowdowns in autos, steel and motorcycles. The
share of Japan in U.S. imports, which had risen steeply since the
early 1960's, declined in the first four months of the year.
Our trade balance with Western Europe in January-April was
a substantial surplus of about $1-1/2 billion at an annual rate,
compared with deficits throughout most of last year, as exports (mainly
agricultural commodities but also aircraft and machinery) rose more
sharply than imports. However, the U.S. trade deficit with Germany
remains about as large as it was last year. The entire improvement
has been with other EC countries, mainly the Netherlands but also
France and Italy. Our trade surplus with Eastern Europe increased,
largely reflecting heavy grain deliveries to the Soviet Union.
Our trade deficit with Canada increased moderately in January-
April; imports (largely automobiles and industrial materials) increased
at a faster pace than exports (largely automobile components and
machinery).
The U.S. trade balance with the developing countries, in
total, changed very little in January-April compared with the
corresponding period of a year earlier. There was an improvement in
our balances with the developing Asian countries but this was just about
offset by a worsening in our trade position with the African countries.

III -13
Trade Developments in Other Industrialized Countries. Inter-
national trade has expanded at an accelerating pace since the low point
around the end of 1971. The average export growth of industrial countries,
which had slowed to an annual rate of only 5-1/2 per cent (measured in
local currencies) in the second half of 1971, was at a 16 per cent rate in
the second half of 1972 and is projected to accelerate to a rate of over
18 per cent in the first half of this year.
This acceleration results in part from the general upswing in
economic activity in the industrial countries, the resumption of more
rapid growth in import demand on the part of the less-industralized
countries, and recently, to a significant extent, from price increases.
But volume growth also shows a considerable acceleration -- almost
tripling from a 4-1/4 per cent annual rate in the second half of 1971
to an estimated 12-1/2 per cent in the first half of this year.
This near-record growth of trade in recent quarters should
help to accommodate the expected adjustment of trade flows in response
to the changes in relative price and cost positions resulting from
the exchange rate changes which have occurred during the past two years.
The difficulties of disentangling the various factors explaining shifts
in trade flows are well-known. At this point, cyclical developments
and above-average price changes appear to predominate, but some shifts
in longer-run trends are becoming discernible.
In terms of volume, U.S. exports in recent months appear to
have grown somewhat faster than those of most other major industrial

III -14
countries. And the growth of U.S. import volume has moderated considerably,
despite the very fast expansion of economic activity. In contrast, the
volume of imports in other industrial countries in the first quarter of
this year rose at an accelerating rate -- to a level more than 20 per cent
higher than a year earlier. A notable exception may be Germany, where
March-April data show only a small increase in import volume despite in-
creasingly high levels of economic activity.
These recent changes in the volume of trade appear to foreshadow
some shift in the longer-term trends which are not as yet clearly apparent
in the value data because of the distorting effects of price changes result-
ing from exchange rate changes. Still, the geographical composition of
the value changes (no volume data by region are available) lends support to
the hypothesis that shifts in underlying trends may have contributed
materially to the recent changes in trade flows. In trade with the non-
OECD area in recent months, the United States has maintained its market
share and even increased it marginally -- a basic shift from the trend
towards declining U.S. shares in the markets of these countries. And in
European markets the U.S. share has stabilized, and may now be rising
slightly. However, the shares of Japan and Australia in European imports
have increased considerably more, albeit from a much smaller base. The
increasing Japanese market share reflects a shift of Japanese exports
away from the U.S. market to those of other industralized countries. Such
a shift clearly is associated with the fact that the revaluation of the

III -15
yen was considerably larger vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar than vis-à-vis the
European currencies. But the Japanese voluntary export restraint programs
also would tend to work in that direction.
Trade trends in Japan, in addition to the factors mentioned above,
have reflected the strong upsurge in domestic activity which has stimulated
imports and created restraints for exports. The rise in industrial pro-
duction and the associated upward swing in the inventory cycle have greatly
increased demand for imports of various commodities, in particular of
lumber, wool, steel scrap and soybeans, all which have sharply increased in
price as well. Other factors contributing to the import expansion include
past actions to lower tariffs and reduce nontariff barriers. The decontrol
of gold imports for private use in April has added further impetus to the
growth of imports -- for the year ending next March, this action may
increase Japan's import bill by almost $0.5 billion.
Import volumes, thus, have grown sharply during the past nine
months, rising from a year-to-year rate of increase of 18 per cent in the
second half of 1972 to a 21 per cent rate in the early months of this
year. Preliminary data indicate that this acceleration continued through
May. Export volumes, though rising, have grown much less than imports:
by 9 per cent, year-over-year, in the second half of 1972 and by 14 per
cent early this year.
With export unit values only rising marginally and average import
values accelerating considerably after an initial fall associated with the
revaluation of the yen, the trade surplus, in yen terms, began to decrease

III -16
in the third quarter of 1972. In U.S. dollar terms, it was down from a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5-1/4 billion in the third quarter
of 1972 to about $2-1/2 billion in April, 1973. In May, according to
preliminary reports, the surplus was further reduced. Although some
part of this reduction results from temporary factors, such as supply
shortages of various commodities, some part reflects the beginning
adjustment to the changed cost and price relationships vis-à-vis the
United States following the revaluations of the yen.
In the United Kingdom, the volume of exports remained relatively
unchanged, when measured in terms of half-yearly averages, from mid-1971
through the end of 1972. In the first quarter of this year, however,
export volumes (seasonally adjusted) averaged 12 per cent higher than in
the last half of 1972. The growth in exports this year has been widely
distributed among the various commodity groups, with major gains in food,
textiles, chemicals and metals. The most recent acceleration in export
growth seems to reflect mainly increased sales to North America and to
the EC. This is due in part to the effective devaluation of the pound
vis-à-vis the EC currencies from mid-1972, as well as to the entry of the
U.K. into the EC.
The volume of imports has been increasing at an accelerating
rate since early 1972. In the first quarter of this year it was 8 per
cent above the average volume during the second half of last year. In
contrast to last year when imports of finished manufactured goods rose

III -17
most rapidly, the fastest rate of growth this year has been in imports of
basic materials.
Changes in the value of trade have been affected significantly
by price developments with export unit values rising much less than import
unit values. During the first quarter of this year, exoort and import
unit values were 3 and 11 per cent higher, respectively, than in the second
half of 1972. The increase in import unit values reflected both higher
world prices for many commodities and the downward float of the sterling
exchange rate.
As a result of these developments, the trade deficit has tended
to increase since early in 1972. In terms of U.S. dollars, it rose from
an annual rate of $2-1/2 billion in the second half of 1972 to almost $3
billion in the first four months of this year.
In Germany, the volume of both exports and imports has risen
more or less in line with total OECD trade, but in recent months export
growth has accelerated substantially, while imports seem to have flattened
out.
Prices of exports and imports (in DM) changed only slightly
between 1971 and 1972. In recent months, however, import prices have
risen sharply -- by 6.4 per cent between the end of 1972 and April 1973 --
and export prices by a larger, but more moderate, 4.8 per cent.
Reflecting these price developments, the German trade surplus,
measured in DM, has risen somewhat less than volume change would indicate.

III -18
In U.S. dollar terms, the trade surplus has risen from an annual rate of
about $6-1/2 billion in 1972 to around $8 billion in February-March of
this year. Large increases in export orders indicate that exports are
likely to continue to expand at a rapid rate. But given the high rate
of economic activity, it also would seem likely that import growth will
accelerate in coming months.
In France, the volume of trade rose sharply in the first half
of 1972 and began to rise further towards the end of the year. Buoyed
by rising exports of agricultural products and automobiles, export
volume in the last half of 1972 was 13.3 per cent higher than in the same
period a year earlier. The volume of imports also rose substantially,
particularly those of consumer goods and agricultural products from outside
the EC. Import volume in the second half of 1972 was 14.6 per cent
higher than in the same period a year earlier. In contrast with develop-
ments elsewhere, export and import unit values were virtually unchanged
at the end of 1972 from year-earlier levels.
In U.S. dollar terms, the trade deficit has grown from an
annual rate of less than $50 million in the second quarter of 1972 to a
$1.7 billion rate in the first quarter of 1973. Most of this deteriora-
tion was in trade with the United States, but some part also reflected
a relatively faster growth of imports from other European countries as
compared with the expansion of exports to that area. The latter develop-
ment, in particular, reflects rising internal demand which tends to pull
in imports and to put some constraint on export supplies.

III -19
In Italy, the volume of exports and imports accelerated last
autumn, with imports rising moderately faster than exports. After re-
maining relatively stable during 1971 and the first nine months of 1972,
imports rose sharply in the fourth quarter to a level 19 per cent higher
than in the same period a year earlier. The surge in imports resulted
from a rebuilding of inventories, a new upturn in fixed investment spend-
ing, and a sharp climb in food imports because of a fall in agricultural
output last year.
Exports rose moderately during 1971 and the first nine months
of 1972, but in the fourth quarter increased to a level 16 per cent
higher than in the same period a year earlier. All of the increase in
exports last year was due to non-food items, with foodstuff exports re-
maining relatively stable due to supply problems.
Export unit values (measured in local currency) remained virtually
stable during 1971-72, and import unit values increased only slightly.
In contrast with the experience of most other countries, the stability
in average trade values was maintained through the second half of 1972.
As a result of these developments, the trade deficit (in terms
of lire with imports c.i.f.) has been increasing since the second quarter
of 1972. In terms of dollars, it increased from a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $0.2 billion in the first quarter of 1972 to $1.9 billion
in the December 1972-January 1973 period. In the coming months, rising
economic activity should result in continuing increases in imports. But

III -20
the large effective devaluation of the lira since the beginning of this
year should be reflected both in an upward movement of exports and a
damping down of imports some time hence.
In Canada, the volume of imports during most of 1972 and into
early 1973 has been rising faster than that of exports. This reflects
largely the fast expansion of domestic activity in Canada. Because export
and import unit values rose only moderately, and more or less at the same
rate, during 1972, the Canadian trade surplus was reduced during the year.
The strength in the value of merchandise imports in 1972 was
widespread, with the largest increases being recorded in purchases of
consumer goods and machinery and equipment, including agricultural equip-
ment. Purchases from the United States rose by about 17 per cent, but
those from Japan and Europe rose even faster.
The growth of Canadian exports, other than that of agricultural
products, was largely concentrated in sales to the United States, being
partly a reflection of the virtually unchanged exchange relationship
between the Canadian and the U.S. currencies, and partly a reflection of
increasing demand for industrial materials in the United States.
During the first three months of 1973, both export and import
unit values rose sharply, with export average values rising 4-3/4 per
cent between December 1972 and March 1973 and those for imports 4-1/4 per
cent. Exports in January-April 1973 began to outstrip imports, partly

III -21
because of rising prices for wheat and other commodities, but partly
also because of rising volumes. As a result, the trade surplus for these
four months rose to an annual rate of $1-3/4 billion (seasonally adjusted)
as compared with a surplus of $1-1/4 billion in 1972.
