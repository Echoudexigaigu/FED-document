Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The staff is now estimating a more moderate advance in GNP
for the second quarter than was projected four weeks ago. The increase
in nominal GNP is expected to be about $33 billion, rather than $36.5
billion, and the annual rate of growth in real GNP has been scaled
down to 4-3/4 per cent from about 6 per cent. In the previous two
quarters, real GNP had risen at an annual rate of 8 per cent. The rise
in the private GNP fixed weight price index for the second quarter is
estimated at about 7 per cent, up from the 6-1/2 per cent projected
four weeks ago and close to the peak first quarter rate.
Slowing in the pace of real growth in the second quarter can
also be seen in the data on industrial production and nonfarm payroll
employment. The June index of industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 4 per cent with increases
mainly in business equipment and a few materials. For the second
quarter as a whole, the rate of increase is estimated at about 7-1/2
per cent, compared with 9 per cent in the first quarter. The slower
industrial growth of recent months is attributable in part to constraints
imposed by available capacity in such diverse industries as metals and
metal fabricating, paper, petroleum and other fuels, and trucks.
Nonfarm payroll employment rose in both June and the second
quarter at an annual rate of about 2-1/2 million--a rapid rate, but
below the exceptional pace of the two preceding quarters. In June, the

I -2
manufacturing workweek edged down further. The unemployment rate,
which had been on a 5 per cent plateau for 6 months, dipped in June to
4.8 per cent, the lowest rate in almost three years.
The second-quarter slowing in GNP growth reflects a virtual
halving of the rise in consumer spending--from an extraordinary $28
billion in the first quarter to less than $15 billion in the second.
In June retail sales were down almost 1 per cent from May, according
to the advance report, and for the second quarter as a whole sales were
little changed from the first quarter. Residential construction
expenditures remained near the first quarter level, but starts were
down significantly.
Meanwhile, business demands have continued strongly expansive.
We have raised somewhat our second-quarter estimate of spending on
fixed capital in the light of available shipments data. New orders
for nondefense capital equipment have risen further, as has the order
backlog for durable goods. It still appears that inventory investment
increased from the first quarter pace, although less than we had
expected earlier.
Following relatively moderate increases early in the year,
the rise in wage rates has been more rapid in recent months. The
private nonfarm hourly earnings index was up at an annual rate of about
6.5 per cent from March to June. Over the past year, the index increased
by 6.2 per cent. Recent labor settlements in major industries have
incorporated increases in wage rates and fringes running around 7
per cent per annum.

I-3
Leading up to the price freeze announced June 13 were
dramatic and sustained increases at wholesale (and at retail) in
prices of farm products and foods and an exceptionally large and wide-
spread advance in industrial prices. In the 5 months of Phase III--
from January to June--the wholesale price index increased 9.5 per cent,
not at an annual rate, with prices of farm products and foods up 18
per cent and industrial commodities almost 6 per cent. The June
wholesale price index, not yet affected by the freeze, was up 2.3 per
cent; prices of farm products and foods rose 5 per cent and industrial
prices 1 per cent.
Outlook. For the second half of 1973, our GNP projection
continues to assume growth in the monetary aggregates at the longer-
term rates agreed to at the June Committee meeting, with market
interest rates remaining at very high levels. The assumptions with re-
spect to Federal expenditures and tax policies remain unchanged.
However, we have attempted in our projections to make allowances for
the current price freeze, and for a Phase IV program that we assume
will permit some upward price flexibility designed to reduce current
structural distortions.
For the third quarter, real GNP is still projected to expand
at an annual rate of close to 4.5 per cent. The increase in nominal
GNP is now projected to be smaller than indicated four weeks ago,
reflecting the price freeze. The private GNP fixed weight price index
is projected to increase at an annual rate of 3.6 per cent in the third
quarter, compared with the 4.6 per cent indicated four weeks ago.

I -4
Prices prior to the imposition of the freeze were already appreciably
above the second quarter average; in addition the freeze is assumed
to be lifted relatively soon.
In the fourth quarter, real GNP is now shown to increase
somewhat more slowly than four weeks ago--by 3.3 per cent. The some-
what larger increase now expected in prices reflects a partial "catch
up" following the end of the freeze. Prices of farm products and foods
are expected to be rising throughout the second half, in view of
demand pressures in this country and abroad and prospects for limited
supplies of meats, poultry and some other food products.
Changes in the projection from the last Greenbook for 1974
are minimal. The pattern remains one of very small quarterly increases
in real GNP--averaging only 1.2 per cent from late 1973 to late 1974--
and a rise in the unemployment rate to 5.5 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1974 from 4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year.
Due to the development of tighter financial markets than had been
expected earlier, the decline in residential construction is now
expected to be somewhat sharper in the first half of the year, and
business fixed investment to be slightly less expansive in the second
half.
The price outlook for 1974 as a whole reflects some easing of
upward pressures on non-food prices attributable to Phase IV controls.
But some further "catch up" is assumed in the first few months of the
year. Moreover, prices of farm products and foods now seem likely to
be somewhat stronger on average than had been previously assumed.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have risen about 0.3 per cent in June, to a level 9 per
cent above a year earlier. Incomplete data indicate that the gains
were mainly in business equipment and some industrial materials.
Auto assemblies in June were at an annual rate of 10.2 million
units compared to a 10.0 million rate in May. Production schedules for
the third quarter indicate little change from the June level. Output
of most other consumer goods in June apparently remained at the advanced
May rate, but weekly production data for some household appliances show
a decline. Production worker manhour data suggest a further strong rise
in output of business equipment. Production of steel mill products and
industrial chemicals is estimated to have advanced further, but weekly
output data for raw steel, paper, and crude oil show little change in
June.
The rate of growth in industrial output has slackened since
late 1972, as shown in the table.

Retail sales. Sales in June were down almost 1 per cent from
May, according to the advance Census estimate. The decline was mostly
attributable to the automotive group which reported a reduction of

I -11
4.4 per cent. Except for the general merchandise group, which showed
an increase of 1 per cent, most of the other major categories of
stores reported sales little different from May.
Second quarter sales were about unchanged from the excep-
tionally strong first quarter level. However, from the fourth quarter
of 1972 to the second quarter of 1973 retail sales rose at an annual
rate of 11.6 per cent. June sales were up 12 per cent from a year
earlier.

Unit sales of consumer durables. June sales of new domestic-
type autos were at a 9.1 million unit annual rate, down 10 per cent
from May but 4 per cent above a year earlier. We are unaware of any
special factors that may have contributed to the decline from a month

I -12
earlier. In the second quarter as a whole, domestic sales averaged
9.6 million units annual rate, compared with 10.3 million in the first
quarter.
Foreign car sales in June were at a 1.8 million unit annual
rate, 4 per cent below a month earlier but a sixth above a year earlier.
Foreign sales averaged 1.8 million units in the second quarter, down
from 2.0 million in the first quarter. The import share in June came
to 16.5 per cent compared to 14.9 per cent a year earlier.
Factory unit sales of major appliances, TVs, and radios are
estimated to have fallen 12 per cent in June from the May level but
were 11 per cent above a year earlier. Appliance sales to dealers
were down 15 per cent from May with all components of the index esti-
mated to be either no higher than or below a month earlier. Sales of
color and monochrome TV each declined 9 per cent from May, while radio
sales were up slightly.

Construction and real estate. The seasonally adjusted value
of new construction put in place edged higher in June to an annual rate
of $138.0 billion. In the private sector, outlays for both residential
construction and nonresidential construction apparently reached new
peaks. Outlays for public construction declined, but were still only
moderately below the high registered last January.
The Census Bureauts composite construction cost index in June
apparently was unchanged from its record May level--at 148 per cent of
the 1967 average. Even so, in real terms, total outlays for construction
in June remained somewhat under the peak reached in the first quarter
of the year.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts turned up sharply
in May to an annual rate of 2.43 million units. However, the upturn
followed three consecutive months of decline, and the April-May average
annual rate--2.27 million units--was still appreciably below the advanced
first quarter pace. Moreover, given the considerably reduced level of
building permits in recent months and other factors, some resumption
of the downtrend in starts most likely occurred in June.

Plant and equipment spending plans. A special resurvey by
McGraw-Hill of companies in their sample indicates no significant
change in capital spending plans between April and June; companies
still report plans for a 19 per cent increase in 1973. The largest
change in spending plans over this period was in durable manufacturing
where a number of firms reported reductions in planned expenditures
because they do not believe they can spend the amounts budgeted earlier.
The new survey plans are still well above the 13 per cent
rise indicated in the May Commerce survey. The discrepancy between
the two surveys probably arises from the adjustment made for reporting
bias by Commerce and the difference in samples; the McGraw-Hill survey
is comprised mainly .of large firms while Commerce includes small companies
as well.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 2.2 per cent in May (p) following an upward revised 0.8 per
cent increase in April. Nondefense capital goods orders were up 2.7
per cent in May and primary metals orders gained 4.5 per cent,

I -17
The April-May average for new orders for durable goods was
4.5 per cent above that of the first quarter, but there has been some
slowing in the rate of growth. Growth in capital goods orders decelerated
somewhat from 6.8 per cent in the first quarter to 4,6 per cent in the
April-May period. Orders for primary metals, however, increased more
rapidly than in the first quarter.
Shipments of durable goods were up in May, and backlogs of
unfilled orders continued to increase rapidly.

Cyclical indicators. The Census composite index of leading
indicators rose 1.5 per cent in May (p). The April decline is now
estimated at 1.7 per cent. The rise in the coincident composite
index slowed in April and May and the deflated coincident index de-
clined in both months. The lagging index rose further in April and May.
Leading series increasing in May were initial claims for
unemployment insurance (inverted), new orders for durable goods, contracts
and orders for plant and equipment, housing permits, industrial materials
prices, and the ratio of price to unit labor cost in manufacturing. Series
declining were the manufacturing workweek and common stock prices. Since
the composite was compiled, a substantial increase has been reported in
the change in consumer instalment debt in May.
In June, common stock prices and the manufacturing workweek
declined while industrial materials prices rose,

The lagging index has been rising relative to the coincident com-

"strain" in the economy. The most striking accelerations among the lagging
indicators over these months have been in business loan interest rates
and business loans outstanding.

I -20
Labor market. The labor market continues to be generally
strong, although the intensity of labor demand appears to have
moderated somewhat. Growth of payroll employment has slowed in the
past few months and the factory workweek declined in June for the
second consecutive month. However, the unemployment rate fell 0.2
percentage points in June to 4.8 per cent, following six months at
about 5 per cent, as gains in total employment outpaced a large increase
in the labor force.
Unemployment in June declined particularly for the 18-24
year group, and the rate for adult males was also off. Unemployment
among Negroes dropped to 8.5 per cent, the lowest rate since the fall
of 1970, while the rate for white workers was unchanged. Compared to
a year ago, the number of unemployed workers has fallen by 600,000 and
the unemployment rate has declined 0.7 percentage points. Unemployment
rates, however, are still well above the cyclical lows prevailing in the
late sixties.

After increasing at about a "normal" rate in 1972, the
labor force has grown quite rapidly in the past half year. Nearly two-
thirds of the recent increase in the labor force has been among women
20 years and over, mostly seeking full-time work, and they have also
accounted for over half of the increase in total employment this year.
Employment and hours. Preliminary nonfarm payroll employment
estimates for June show an increase of 200,000 with gains widespread.
Although payroll employment increased rapidly in the second quarter,
the rate of growth slowed from the extremely fast pace of the previous
two quarters. Reduced rates of growth have been evident in both the
goods and service sectors of the private economy; all the slowing in
manufacturing has occurred among production workers. The factory work-
week has also been drifting down in the past few months from the peak
of 41 hours (the same as the high in 1968-69) reached in February.

Earnings. The pace of increase in the hourly earnings index
apparently has picked up in recent months during Phase III, although
over short periods this series has been relatively volatile in the
past. The largest increase has been in manufacturing where the
earnings index rose at a 6.8 per cent annual rate during the past three
months, compared to a 5.4 per cent rate over the preceding nine months.
In some manufacturing industries--such as autos, steel and cans--the
recent rise partly reflects automatic cost-of-living increases. The
rate of earnings increase has also accelerated in trade and service;
both industries had shown relatively moderate rates of rise prior to
the recent speed-up.

Industrial productivity and labor costs. Unit labor costs in
the industrial sector rose at an annual rate of 3.0 per cent in the
second quarter of 1973, according to preliminary estimates. This was
down sharply from the 8.1 per cent rate of the first quarter which had
reflected the increase in employer contributions for social security
taxes, effective at the beginning of the year. Productivity increased
at a 2.9 per cent annual rate, little different from the first quarter,
while the rise in compensation per manhour slowed to an annual rate of
6.0 per cent. Compared with a year earlier, unit labor costs in the
second quarter were up 4.0 per cent with compensation per manhour up
8.0 per cent and productivity 4.0 per cent.

Industrial relations. The Teamsters Union and the trucking
industry reached tentative agreement on a new 33 month contract which
provides wage and benefit increases averaging a minimum of about 7
per cent a year over the life of the contract. The new agreement, which
covers about 400,000 workers, provides first year wage and benefit
boosts of about 7.5 per cent effective July 1, 1973, with 7.0 per cent
guaranteed in the second year and 6.5 per cent in the third year,
including guaranteed cost-of-living adjustments of 8 cents an hour in
the second and third contract years. A maximum of 11 cents an hour
may be paid in each of the second and third years depending on the
increase in the Consumer Price Index. The escalator formula provides
a one cent per hour raise for each 0.3 per cent rise in the CPI.
In the potentially most expensive settlement so far this year,
the postal unions reached tentative agreement with the U.S. Postal
Service on a two year contract which would provide wage and benefit
increases of 8 per cent in the first year beginning July 20, 1973,
and 6 per cent in the second, plus an unlimited cost-of-living adjust-
ment. This escalator pays 1 cent an hour for each 0.4 per cent rise in
the CPI.
In other industrial relations developments, the West Coast
longshoremen reached a tentative settlement with the Pacific Maritime
Association on a two year contract covering about 13,000 dock workers.
Pay boosts total 7.8 per cent in the first year and 5.5 per cent in the
second year with no cost-of-living provisions. The agreement also
provides for paid holidays and a guaranteed work week as well as for
no layoffs during the two contract years.

I -25
Consumer prices. Consumer prices continued to rise rapidly
in May, although the increase of 0.6 per cent in both April and May
was below the seasonally-adjusted March rise of 0.9 per cent. During
the first four months of Phase III consumer food prices rose at an
annual rate of over 20 per cent, and nonfood commodity prices at a rate
of about 5 per cent--about twice their rate of rise in Phase II.
Consumer service prices have accelerated less, however, with home finance
costs moderating the rate of rise in recent months.
In May, prices of restaurant meals advanced sharply and
there were large increases in prices for cereal and bakery products and
fresh vegetables. On an unadjusted basis, meat prices dropped slightly.
Among nonfoods, gasoline, fuel oil, furniture, and used cars increased.
Among services, rents and home maintenance and mortgage interest costs
moved up faster than in April.
The trend of wholesale prices suggests that June will also
see a large rise at the retail level. Wholesale prices of eggs, dairy-
products, fresh fruits and vegetables, and indeed, of most foods, rose
in June. Wholesale prices of consumer nonfoods have advanced at well
over twice the rate of retail prices in Phase III, a differential that
suggests that at least some retail lines may be undergoing a profit
squeeze under the current freeze.

1/ Farm products, and processed foods and feeds.
From May to June the index of farm and food products increased
5.0 per cent, seasonally adjusted. Increases were widespread and large,
especially for manufactured animal feeds, oilseeds--particularly soy-
beans--and feed grains, which together accounted for about three-fourths of
the rise in the index of farm and food products and about one-half of
the increase in the overall WPI.
The increase in consumer finished foods accelerated from May
to June, largely because of higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables,
eggs, fats and oils, and meats.
Prices of industrial commodities rose 1.0 per cent after
seasonal adjustment and 12.4 per cent at an annual rate. Fuels and
power accounted for more than 50 per cent of this advance with higher

I -28
prices for refined petroleum products--35 per cent above a year
earlier--chiefly responsible. Other major influences included increases
for metals and metal products, textile products, chemicals, and paper
products. The decline in the lumber and wood products index--the first
since October 1971 and only the second since December 1970--reflected
lower prices for softwood lumber and softwood plywood.
Price increases for consumer nonfood finished goods
accelerated even beyond the high rates of other recent months; higher
prices for distillates, gasoline, jewelry, and household furniture were
mainly responsible for the rise in this index.
Producer finished goods prices rose 0.3 per cent following
several months of much more rapid increases, reflecting chiefly a much
slower rise for machinery and equipment although nearly all categories
of this group advanced.
The BLS metals index based on Tuesday spot market prices has
not changed since the inauguration of the recent freeze, and the U.S.
prices of several metals, including copper, lead, and zinc are sub-
stantially below those on the London Metals Exchange. The recently
imposed export controls on iron and steel scrap apparently have had
little or no effect on U.S. scrap prices.

total are estimated and exclude foods. Consumer finished foods
are foods in their final state ready for use by consumers and
include some commodities in the farm products group and most
commodities in the group for processed foods and feeds.
Agriculture. Prices received by farmers increased 6 per cent
during the month ending June 15. The increase resulted mainly from
higher prices for corn, soybeans, wheat, hogs, eggs, and potatoes. On
June 13, commodity prices at all off-farm marketing points were frozen
at their levels of June 1-8. Since then, little price movement has
been noted, except for hogs, grains, and soybeans.
Soybean prices declined sharply after export restrictions were
imposed on June 27. Expected outflow of old-crop soybeans and meal
would have left the domestic livestock industry far short of its high-
protein feed requirements.

I -30
Export controls were extended on July 5 to cover all oil-
seed, oilseed meals and edible oils which substitute for soybean
products. Also, demand for protein meals is partially transferable to
feedgrains. The resulting uncertainty regarding the possibility of
curbs on grain exports has contributed to fluctuations in corn prices.
Hog prices, which were not subject to the freeze but remain
under pressure from the meat price ceilings established in March, have
risen about 10 per cent since mid-June. The price ceiling on beef has
kept cattle prices stable for many weeks.
June red meat supplies were about even with pre-boycott
levels, but were still 9 per cent below supplies in the second quarter
of last year. A recent survey of hog farmers indicates there will be
no further increase in pork supplies for about a year. The tight meat
supply situation will be further aggravated by declining poultry supplies,
expected to fall 5 to 10 per cent below last year's level by October.
High feed costs have been a major factor contributing to continued tight
meat supplies and have also been associated with a 2 per cent decline in
milk production from last year.
High feed costs are expected to be somewhat alleviated by
ample new-crop soybean supplies. A record 55.7 million acres of soy-
beans have been planted, 22 per cent more than last year and 31 per cent
above 1971. Corn acreage for grain is 9 per cent more than last year,
but less than hoped. Feedgrain supplies may therefore continue to be
tight during the new crop year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Short-term interest rates, which rose throughout June, surged
in early July after announcement of a one-half point increase in the
discount rate and a hike in reserve requirements. Treasury bill rates
have advanced 65 basis points since the last FOMC meeting, while most
other short-term rates--including the prime rate--have increased 3/4
to 1 percentage point.
Short-term rates currently are around their 1969-70 cyclical
peaks. Long-term rates, however, remain substantially below their
previous cyclical highs. While the sustained rise in short-term rates
and the indications of tightening monetary policy weakened market expecta-
tions of a near-term peak in rates, the continuing moderate volume of
corporate and municipal bond offerings helped limit the increase in
bond yields to 1/4 percentage point or less.
Pressures in mortgage markets have intensified in recent weeks.
With institutional commitment policies reportedly becoming more restric-
tive, mortgage yields have moved significantly higher. Interest rate
ceilings on FHA- and VA-insured mortgages were increased 3/4 of a
percentage point at the end of June, but the failure of Congress to
renew the insurance program has resulted in a halt of new commitments
in this sector of the housing market. The sharply increased attractive-
ness of yields on market securities relative to those on depositary
claims resulted in some disintermedation in key regional markets over

II -2
the June-July interest crediting period. Inflows of savings
funds for the recent quarter as a whole, however, were surprisingly
well maintained, perhaps partly reflecting the large income tax refunds
and the recent slowing of consumer spending.
The bank credit proxy continued to expand at a relatively
fast pace in June. Banks raised their prime rate and reportedly
continued to tighten nonprice lending practices. As pressures on
lendable funds increased, some banks liquidated securities. Business
loan growth slowed in June, but with commercial paper increasing
considerably, total short-term business credit demands remained strong.
Outlook. Interest rates do not appear to have adjusted fully
to the recent further tightening of monetary policy, and credit demands are
still likely to be sizable given the rate of growth projected in
nominal GNP. As the effects of current monetary restraint continue
to work through the system, financial institutions will no doubt
undertake additional tightening of lending policies and portfolio
adjustments, which will contribute to upward interest rate pressures.
At banks, demands for credit from businesses are likely to
remain strong in coming months given their expanding financing
requirements and the projected slowing in their generation of internal
funds. Even with the liberalized Regulation Q ceiling rates, deposit
flows will probably moderate and induce banks to rely on high-cost
CD funds, other non-deposit sources of funds, and further reductions
in liquidity positions. The pressure on lendable funds implies

II -3
further upward adjustments in the prime rate and tightening of nonprice
lending terms. There are scattered reports of banks not accommodating
in total the credit needs of certain customers who shifted their
financing from the commercial paper market earlier this year. As these
borrowers and others are discouraged from financing at banks, demands
on the commercial paper market especially will increase.
Corporations might also be induced to increase their capital
market financing, although underwriters continue to report little
interest on the part of industrial firms to enter the market at the
present time. If expectations should shift to the view that long-term
rates will rise and remain high for some time, the volume of corporate
bond offerings could rise considerably. In the municipal market,
rising rates might cause some borrowers to postpone planned offerings,
particularly for projects employing long-term revenue bonds which
generally carry restrictive call-protection features.
Although the Treasury will not be raising new money in the
market until the fall, borrowing by Federal agencies is likely to be
very heavy. The housing finance agencies, most notably the FHLB Banks,
are expected to support an increased share of residential mortgage
credit financing given the reduced inflows of deposits at thrift
institutions. Additional cutbacks on new commitments for residential
mortgages are in prospect along with rate increases on conventional

II -4
mortgages appreciably larger than in recent months, except in states
with restrictive usury ceilings where the supply of mortgage funds
will presumably dry up.

M2 and M3 also grew at more rapid rates in June than in other
recent months, but the more rapid growth in these aggregates reflected
entirely the faster growth in M1. Commercial bank time deposits other
than large negotiable CD's slowed to a 7.5 per cent rate of increase,
as the interest rates paid on these deposits under Regulation Q
ceilings became increasingly less attractive to investors compared to
the rising rates available on market securities. To permit these time
deposits to be more competitive, effective July 1 ceiling rates were
increased on regular savings deposits by one-half percentage point and
on small-denomination time deposits by one-fourth to three-fourths of
a percentage point on most maturities; ceilings were suspended entirely
on minimum deposits of $1,000 with maturities of four years or more.
In order to shed light on the response by banks to the change
in Regulation Q, an informal survey was made through the Reserve Bank
Contact Group. Most of the banks contacted reported that offering
rates had immediately been adjusted upward to the new ceiling levels
on time deposits, although a few large banks were still paying 4.5
per cent on passbook accounts. Respondents generally were still
uncertain as to the rates which would be offered on the new accounts
with maturities of four years or more. While a few banks suggested 7
to 7.5 per cent as possibilities, others reported that they probably
would not offer more than 6.5 per cent, depending on the rates offered
by competitiors.

Monetary aggregates. In June, M1 increased at a 12.5 per
cent annual rate, even more rapidly than in May. Preliminary data
indicate that deposit growth during the month was widely distributed
among both large and small banks. The June expansion in M1 brought
the annual rate of increase for the first two quarters of 1973 to
about 6 per cent.

Growth in large negotiable CD's slowed in June to the smallest
rate of increase in eight months. This slowdown appears to have been
due to a combination of factors. With demand deposit inflows stronger
and loan expansion weaker (discussed below), banks needed less growth
in purchased funds than in other recent months. In addition, there
were unusually large CD runoffs associated with the mid-month income
tax payments. Moreover, banks incurred increasingly higher costs
for funds, with rates advancing another 50-75 basis points during the
month, although the advance barely kept pace with yields on other market
instruments. The effective cost of CD funds to banks was increased
further by the imposition of an additional 3 per cent marginal reserve
requirement on net sales of these instruments--possibly contributing
to the slower June growth. Reflecting the mid-May suspension of
ceiling rates on longer maturity CD's, which was coupled with
imposition of marginal reserve requirements, the average maturity on
new issues of CD's increased from 2.2 months in May to 2.4 months in
June.
Following substantial declines in the previous two months,
there was a moderate increase in U. S. Government deposits in June.
However, this rise along with the growth in private demand deposits
only partially offset the slower growth in CD's and other time
deposits. Consequently, growth in the adjusted bank credit proxy slowed

II -8
to an annual rate of about 11 per cent in June, somewhat below the
14 per cent rate of earlier months.
Bank credit. Following five months of rapid growth, seasonally
adjusted bank credit, as measured on a last-Wednesday-of-the-month
basis, showed almost no growth in June. This abrupt slowdown is in
sharp contrast to the continued rapid though reduced expansion in the
daily-average adjusted credit proxy noted above. However, the dis-
parities in the month-to-month changes in these two series frequently
are the result of random fluctuations or seasonal adjustment problems
in the single day measurement of the last-Wednesday series, and
estimating end-of-month window dressing is an additional complication
in June. Thus, a better measure of the underlying trend in last-
Wednesday-of-the-month bank credit data is provided by the 11 per cent
average growth rate over the May-June period combined.

Total loans in June declined $400 million, bringing the
May-June net expansion to an annual rate near 14 per cent. The
weakness in June reflected, in part, a sharp decline in security
loans, apparently associated with a reduction in dealer inventories.
Loans to nonbank financial institutions also were substantially
weaker in June following the sharp surge in May. This slowdown
apparently was associated in part with reduced borrowing by mortgage

II -10
companies, which are reported to have been reducing their inventories
of mortgages because of exceptionally high financing costs and the
expectation of rising mortgage interest rates.
Though strong, the June expansion in business loans--at a
14 per cent annual rate--was considerably less than the exceedingly
rapid increases of earlier months. Some of this slowing no doubt
resulted as banks responded to the rising costs and reduced availability
of funds by making substantial upward adjustments in the large business
prime rate (100 basis points over the month to 8-1/4 per cent in early
July) and by applying more restrictive nonprice lending terms. In
addition, corporate borrowing to finance quarterly tax payments appeared
to be somewhat lighter than in previous years as the proceeds of a
large volume of maturing CD's became available close to the mid-month
tax date.
While business loans grew less rapidly in June, preliminary
estimates indicate that dealer-placed commercial paper outstanding
rose substantially, perhaps indicating some switch of borrowers back
into the commercial paper market. Thus, total business demand for
short-term credit, as measured by the sum of business borrowings at
banks plus commercial paper, remained strong. As shown in the table,
the 21 per cent growth rate in total short-term business credit in
the second quarter was only slightly less than the rapid first quarter
pace.

Although banks reduced their holdings of municipals and

on a seasonally adjusted basis, reflecting in part the smaller than
usual volume of bank holdings of June tax bills, which ran off at
maturity.

Nonbank financial institutions. Deposit inflows at mutual
savings banks and savings and loan associations appear to have been
stronger during May and June than many observers expected in light of
rising market yields. May inflows at the two sets of thrift institu-
tions combined were at a 9.3 per cent annual rate, as compared with the
8.0 per cent rate estimated in the last Greenbook. Based on sample
data, the inflows during June are now estimated at an 11 per cent
rate for S&L's and an 8 per cent rate for MSB's.

Pressures toward disintermediation however, may have begun
to manifest themselves in the latter part of June and in early July.
Deposit outflows at large New York City MSB's during the June grace
period were the largest since 1970, and there were very sizable outflows

II -13
(more than twice those of 1970) on the first business day of July. A
sample group of California S&L's reported marked outflows during the
last week of June and extremely weak inflows during the first week of
July; nationally, only interest crediting prevented a small decline
in S&L savings capital during the last 10 days of June.
The confluence of heavy takedowns from a record level of
mortgage commitments and declining inflows of new money has led S&L's
to reduce their liquidity and increase their indebtedness to the
FHLBanks. Cash and liquid assets of insured S&L's declined in May,
the most recent month for which balance sheet data are available,
pushing the liquidity ratio of these institutions below 9.3 per cent,
compared with the recently reduced FHLBB minimum of 6.5 per cent.
One year ago the May ratio was 10.3 per cent, and two years ago it was
11.4 per cent. FHLBank advances to S&L's rose $900 million in June
and increased at a rate of $280 million per week in the last week of
June and first week of July. Since the beginning of the year, advances
outstanding have risen more than $3.1 billion to a record high level.
The heavy volume of advances is cutting deeply into FHLBank liquidity,
which will not be boosted until July 25 by the proceeds of a $1 billion
cash financing.
The new deposit rate ceilings, established July 5, give
thrift institutions more scope to compete for savings, but the gap
between market rates and ceiling rates on shorter-term deposits is

II -14
sizable. Also, under the new regulations the ceiling rate on S&L
passbook accounts is only 25 basis points higher than that on
commercial bank passbooks, as opposed to the previous 50 basis
point differential. How depositary institutions will respond to the
new ceilings and, in particular, to the new 4 year and over no-
ceiling option is as yet unclear. Reports in the press indicate that
the limited number of institutions taking quick action on rates have
employed rather diverse strategies, and there undoubtedly will be a
lag before competitive forces bring about an "equilibrium" rate
structure.
Commercial paper outstanding. Total commercial paper
outstanding rose an estimated $1.5 billion seasonally adjusted in
June, the largest monthly increase since June 1972. Nonbank-related
dealer placed paper expanded $0.7 billion during the month, reversing
the January to May contraction, which totaled $4.0 billion. To some
extent, the June increase reflected the reported return to the paper
market of some firms that had earlier shifted to less costly bank
financing. Although the effective cost of bank borrowing in many
cases remained below the cost in the commercial paper market, banks
apparently were discouraging credit extensions to certain of these
customers.
In the directly placed market, finance companies expanded
their use of commercial paper in June as in other recent months.

Consumer credit. In May, total consumer credit outstanding
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $26.7 billion, up
considerably from April, but still below the near-record March increase.
The April-May average credit expansion continued to represent an
unusually strong rate of growth, both absolutely and relative to the
amount of debt outstanding, but was marginally below the pace of the
previous two quarters.
Seasonally adjusted extensions of instalment credit during
May reached a new high annual rate of $167 billion, while repayments,

II -16
at a$143 billion rate, were down slightly from April's record pace.
The increase in personal instalment loans extended was particularly
strong. Although a loan drive at a major finance company accounted
for part of this increase, personal loans extended by banks and credit
unions also expanded strongly. Extensions of automobile credit also
rose fairly sharply from April, reflecting in part the pick-up in new
car sales.
Finance rates on consumer instalment loans, which have shown
little tendency to rise in recent months, edged upward in some categories
during May. The average rate on new-auto contracts at major auto
finance companies rose another 3 basis points to 11.91 per cent,
exceeding the year-earlier level by a small margin. At commercial
banks, no movement towards higher rates on direct new-auto loans is yet
evident, but rates on mobile home loans apparently rose significantly
during May.
Non-rate terms on new-auto loans continue to be liberalized
gradually at the major auto finance companies, where the weighted
average maturity moved up in May to 35.3 months. About 2.7 per cent
of new car loans made by finance companies in May had maturities
exceeding 36 months, up from 0.6 per cent a year ago and 1.5 per cent
in January this year.
Although some recent loan delinquency statistics suggest
that consumers may be having greater difficulty keeping their loans

II -17
current, personal bankruptcies have shown a different pattern.
Personal bankruptcies declined more than 7 per cent on a seasonally
adjusted annual basis in the first quarter, and were 21 per cent below
the peak in the third quarter of 1970, continuing a downtrend that
has persisted for over two years. Provisions of the Consumer Pro-
tection Act of 1970, which limit the percentage of salaries and
wages that can be garnished and restrict employers' freedom to fire
employees whose wages are garnished, have reduced the necessity for
resorting to bankruptcy and thus probably have contributed to the
magnitude of the decline.

II -18
Short-term markets. Short-term interest rates have increased
substantially since the last FOMC meeting. Rates on 3- and 6-month
Treasury bills, for example, are now both at 7.89 per cent, about
65 basis points above their levels at the time of the meeting, and
the gains in private short-term rates generally have exceeded the bill
rate increases. The highest rates currently being quoted in the three
month maturity range on prime bankers' acceptances (9.25 per cent),
large negotiable certificates of deposits at New York City banks
(9.25 per cent) and prime commercial paper (9.00 per cent) are all
about 100 basis points higher than prevailed 4 weeks ago, and there
are reports that even higher rates must be paid to do a substantial
volume of business. Also bank prime rates are now at 8.25 per cent,
up 75 basis points. As a result of these latest advances, short-term
rates generally are near--and in a few cases are above--their previous
record highs established in late 1969 or early 1970.
While interest rates have increased almost continuously since
the last Committee meeting, the uptrend was the sharpest in late June
and early July. Market participants, noting the continued strength in
M1, began marking rates up in expectation of possible System policy
actions. Confirmation of these expectations, provided by the Board's
action on Friday, June 29, gave rise to further sharp rate increases
in the early part of last week. Rates were sustained at these higher
levels by much tighter conditions in the Federal funds market, as
reflected by funds trading at rates as high as 15 per cent and effective
rates of 10 per cent and 13 per cent on Monday and Tuesday. While
market participants recognized that these exceptionally high rates

II -19
were the result of market churning associated with an end-of-quarter
statement date and mid-week holiday, they nonetheless concluded that
the System had assumed a tighter stance in its provision of reserves
through open market operations. Conditions in the funds market eased
to some extent following the fourth of July holiday--although the
effective funds rate remained around 9.50 per cent--and short-term
Treasury bills rates stabilized, at least temporarily. Private short-
term rates, however, have continued advancing in recent days.
The Government securities market appears to have emerged
from the substantial tightening of credit market conditions in good
technical position. Dealer positions in both bills and coupon issues
are currently on the low side, as they were prior to the sharp run-up
in interest rates. And, while capital losses were incurred by many
firms, the size of these losses appears to have been held to manageable
amounts.
The volume of noncompetitive bids submitted in the Treasury's
weekly bill auction has increased significantly in recent weeks. The
volume of such bids in the auction of July 9, for example, totaled
$613 million, about $300 million higher than the average during the
auctions in May. The current level of bids, however, remains well
below highs established in late 1969 and 1970.

Long-term securities markets. Yields on new private long-
term debt securities have risen from 10 to 20 basis points above their
mid-June levels, with most of the advance occurring in early July. As
money market rates surged in response to Federal Reserve actions, market
expectations of a near-term peak in interest rates seemed to fade, and
prices on inventories of corporate and municipal bonds were marked down.
Yields on long-term Treasury bonds also increased about an eighth of a
percentage point since the June Greenbook.
Corporate offerings of public bonds in June amounted to a

at about $1 billion each. Thus far no buildup in corporate filings has
occurred, although underwriters expect the volume of offerings to increase
sharply in the Fall. Not only will the need to finance projected capital
expenditures bring corporations to the debt market, but some firms may be
encouraged to issue bonds by the increased stringency in the bank loan
market. Furthermore, although corporate liquidity is much improved in

II -23
relation to late 1969 and 1970, it is still well below the levels of
the early 1960's.
Takedowns of private placements increased to $700 million in
April, the last month for which SEC figures are available. Life insur-
ance commitment data indicate that this high level of activity is con-
tinuing into the summer months, and several large industrial companies
recently have announced private placements of long-term debt. The
available data indicate that interest costs of private placements to
borrowers continue to be low relative to costs of public issues.

Staff estimates that new equity issues are likely to average
below $1 billion monthly during the summer reflect the drop in utility
preferred stock schedulings and the impact of a prolonged slump in
stock prices on initial public offerings. Stock prices moved irregu-
larly lower throughout the month of June but ended the month only
slightly lower than at the end of May. Prices declined further to new

II -24
lows early in July, however, when interest rates rose sharply and the
international financial situation deteriorated. The relaxation of
dividend restrictions had little apparent effect on the major stock
price indexes. The CID action, however, did precipitate a marked one-
day increase in NYSE trading volume to 18.5 million shares on the day
following the announcement, as compared to a June average of 12.8
million.
Offerings of long-term tax exempt bonds totaled $1.9 billion
in June, and the staff expects some tapering in the volume of issues
during the summer. Yields, as measured by the Bond Buyer index, rose
about 20 basis points during the last few weeks; and the index is
now near its 1973 high. Underwriters report fairly heavy selling of
shorter-term municipals by large commercial banks recently, reflecting
increased pressure on the availability of bank lendable funds.
Short-term tax-exempt securities outstanding rose about $228
million during the second quarter, but over the first six months of
1973 as a whole, such securities declined by more than $1 billion.
Mortgage market. During recent weeks, new mortgage commitment
volume has declined somewhat further and rates on both construction and
permanent mortgage loans have continued upward, judging from trade
opinion and field reports. Insured S&L's--the dominant residential
mortgage lender--apparently cut back on the volume of new mortgage
commitments again in May to a level sharply below the January high,
according to Federal Reserve estimates. Outstanding mortgage commit-
ments, which are reported directly by S&L's, were down further in May
to a seasonally adjusted level 7 per cent below the peak reached early
this year.

II -25
Interest rates on conventional home mortgages in the primary
market accelerated their uptrend shortly after increases were announced
in the rate ceilings applicable to consumer-type savings deposits and
to FHA/VA mortgages. According to the weekly Federal Home Loan Mort-
gage Corporation series for 120 S&L's, contract interest rates offered
on new commitments for typical 80 per cent loan-to-value ratio conven-
tional home mortgages averaged 7.89 per cent in the week ended July 6--
up 13 basis points above the week-earlier level and up 16 basis points
above a month earlier. On the West Coast, new commitment rates on 80
per cent conventional loans were raised in early July to 8-1/4 per
cent by some lenders. The HUD (FHA) series for late June should be
available for the Greenbook supplement. Early returns indicate that
the series average for contract rates paid by borrowers on all types
of conventional new-home mortgage commitments was somewhat above the
7.95 per cent level reported in late May.
Faced by increasingly large discounts on fixed-rate FHA and
VA mortgages that had begun to discourage transactions, the Secretary
of HUD and the Veterans Administrator on July 5 announced an increase
to 7.75 per cent from the 7 per cent rate that had been in effect for
such mortgages since February 1971. However, mortgages can be under-
written at the new higher rate only after Congress reactivates the
FHA and the VA insurance authority that lapsed at the end of June.
Reflecting increasing yield pressures in the mortgage market
generally as well as uncertainty about private lender reception of
Government underwritten mortgages that would bear the new higher ceiling
rate, the average auction yield on FNMA forward commitments to purchase

II -26
FHA/VA home mortgages increased sharply to 8.38 per cent on July 9--
up 29 basis points from the figure two weeks earlier and the highest
level since December 1970. Offerings to FNMA reached the largest
volume since August 1971, owing partly to the suspension, effective
July 5, of the discount subsidy program under which GNMA had supported
the price of eligible Government underwritten mortgages in order to
prevent excessive discounts.

Agricultural credit. Growth in farm mortgage debt outstanding
has continued to reflect higher land prices and the well-above-average
number of farm transfers. At Federal Land Banks which account for
approximately one-fourth of all outstanding farm mortgage debt, holdings
of farm mortgages at the end of May were $1.6 billion, or 19 per cent,
larger than a year earlier. FLB loans closed during the 12 months
ending in May were up by 60 per cent over the preceding 12-month period,
with the number of loans and the average loan size each up by 25 per
cent. At the same time, mortgage interest rates charged by the Federal
Land Banks have remained stable since August of 1972.
Demand for farm production credit also has continued strong as
farmers have borrowed funds to finance higher-priced feed and live-
stock inventories as well as increased crop production. At production
credit associations (PCA's), new-loan volume during the first five
months of 1973 averaged 24 per cent above the same period of 1972.
Unlike the long-term Federal Land Bank loans, interest rates on short-
term PCA loans have been rising steadily since mid-1972 and in June 1973
were typically between 7-1/2 and 8-1/2 per cent. Interest rates charged
by commercial banks on farm production loans also have increased during
the same period.

II -28
Federal Finance. Final budget figures for fiscal 1973 are
not yet available. Based on preliminary estimates of June activity,
however, it appears that the fiscal 1973 deficit will be about $16.2
billion, with outlays at $248.7 billion, about $1.0 billion less than
had been expected, and receipts at $232.5 billion, a figure unchanged
from the preceding two Greenbooks. The corresponding official Administra-
tion estimates were $249.7 billion for outlays and $232.0 billion for
receipts.
For fiscal 1974 the forecast is still one of a budget close to
balance. In spite of the recent spurt of legislation authorizing in-
creases in spending (see table) our fiscal 1974 budget outlays projec-
tion remains at $269.7 billion. Among the new spending authorizations
are welfare benefit increases and a 5.6 per cent social security
benefit increase effective June 1, 1974 but to be paid beginning July 1,
1974. Together, the effect on fiscal 1974 outlays is about $0.7
billion, and compares with the $1.0 billion spending in excess of the
Budget already allowed for in the staff projections. The fiscal 1975
effect of these authorizations is estimated at $2.8 billion, of which
all but $0.6 billion is for social security and was anticipated in the
estimates presented at the June meeting.
The proposed spending ceiling of $268.7 billion for fiscal
1974 was not included in recent legislation. However, a new temporary
(through November 30, 1973) debt ceiling of $465 billion has gone into

II -29
effect. While this relatively low ceiling may exert some downward
pressure on the pace of outlays during the next few months, the general
features of Congressional influence on the Budget remain largely unre-
solved, since no appropriation bills have as yet been passed and the
Federal agencies mostly are operating on the basis of continuing resolu-
tions.
On the receipts side, the effect of reductions in staff fore-
casts of personal income has been largely offset by an increase in
receipts of $0.5 billion stemming from the recent relaxation of restric-
tions on dividend pay-out ratios by the Committee on Interest and Divi-
dends. Our fiscal 1974 budget receipts forecast is $269.8 billion.
The end-of-June Treasury cash balance was $12.6 billion, a
figure $0.6 billion above that projected in the June Greenbook. Our
current projection of the end-of-July cash balance is $7.2 billion.
The temporary debt ceiling of $465 billion should pose no serious
problems for the Treasury over the near-term. Cash balances may be
sufficient to allow postponement of additional net borrowing from the
public until November. While the debt subject to ceiling will continue
to move toward the limit due to the sale of special issues to the trust
funds, it is not expected to reach it until November, although, given
the seasonal pattern of sales to the trust funds, it may come close in
late August. In mid-August the Treasury will need to refund $4.7
billion of maturing issues held by the public.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. In recent weeks the accelerating decline of
the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against continental European
currencies -- especially the German mark -- has been the dominant feature
of the international financial scene. Although the dollar changed little
relative to other currencies that together account for a large part of
U.S. international transactions (Japanese yen, Italian lira, Canadian
dollar, and sterling), there was mounting disorder in dealings in the
major continental currencies. To a large extent, the effect that tightened
monetary policy in the United States might have had in reassuring the
exchange markets was offset by a similar tightening of monetary policy in
other industrial countries. The U.S. price freeze was widely viewed as
only a stop-gap.
Adding to the many anxieties overhanging the market, U.S. export
restraints were put on a lengthing list of agricultural and other products
to avoid severe domestic shortages in the months ahead. The effect of
these restraints on actual exports is difficult to judge, since so much
depends on the size of the new crops here and abroad, but the market was
shocked by this abrupt turn in the most expansive sector of U.S. exports,
and viewed it as a threat to prospects for further gains in the U.S. trade
balance (which had worsened again in May).
Although the United States was registering a surplus on the
official settlements balance in the second quarter, thanks mainly to sales

III -2
of dollars by Japan, the basic balance probably worsened from the $5 billion
annual rate of deficit registered in the first quarter. The trade balance
improved (though June data are not yet available) in spite of a much faster
rise in import than in export unit values. However, net investment income
receipts were probably lower and, most importantly, there was apparently
little or no net inflow to purchase U.S. securities after April, in con-
trast to large foreign purchases in the first quarter.
If the present set of exchange rates were to persist very long,
it would be necessary to reevaluate the whole balance of payments
picture. Existing exchange rates would distort trade relationships by
significantly undervaluing U.S. goods, and would further complicate the
problems of controlling U.S. prices. A more likely outcome is that
exchange rates will soon adjust so as to become more representative of
relative international costs and prices, and the balance-of-payments
outlook will then focus squarely on the effectiveness of U.S. policy
actions against inflation over the longer run. While it is clear that
the market has now undervalued the dollar, it should also be noted that
there have been some unfavorable developments since February's devaluation,
especially further inflation and fears of scarcities in the United States
and increasingly restrictive monetary policies abroad.

III -3
Foreign exchange markets. The principal feature of exchange
market developments in recent weeks, through July 6, was the sharp depre-
ciation of the dollar, principally against continental European currencies,
and the even sharper appreciation of the German mark. (The dollar showed
little change against the Canadian dollar and the yen, and the Bank of
Japan continued to sell dollars except for a few days preceding July 9.)
Behind the divergent movements of the dollar and the mark was the market's
preception of the outlook for inflation and the balance of payments of
the German and American economies. The market was clearly convinced that
Germany's anti-inflation policies were likely to be more successful than
those so far undertaken by the United States, with obvious implications
for the balance of payments of the two countries. In addition, U.S.
selective export controls were seen as directly hurting the U.S. balance
of payments position.

by press reports out of Zurich indicating that the U.S. would soon intervene
to support the dollar. On Tuesday the rally continued, buoyed by the
announcement of a $6.2 billion increase in the size of the swap network
and heightened market expectations of System intervention.
The System, in fact, did go into the market on Tuesday afternoon,
and that afternoon and the following morning sold small amounts of German
marks, French frnncs, and Belgian francs. (System intervention STRICTLY
CONFIDENTIAL) On Wednesday morning, the dollar's advance persisted, so
that by mid-morning in New York, the dollar had appreciated about 6 per
cent against the mark and the Swiss franc and 7 per cent against the French
franc from the previous Friday afternoon, bringing rates back to around
the levels of end-June. As of Wednesday morning, the mark was 52 per cent,
the Swiss franc 52 per cent, and the French franc 34 per cent above their
May 1970 dollar par values.
Euro-dollar market. Under the influence of rising interest
rates in the United States, rising interest rates abroad, and -- especially
in recent days -- speculative selling pressure on the dollar in exchange
markets, Euro-dollar interest rates have moved up sharply during the past
four weeks. During the week ended July 4, Euro-dollar deposits of one-
month maturity were bid at an average rate of nearly 9 per cent, an
increase of over 1/3 percentage point from levels in the first half of
June. The increase in United States CD rates was also pronounced during
this period and the amount by which the one-month Euro-dollar rate exceeded
the comparable maturity CD rate declined from an average of nearly 1 per-
centage point in the week ended June 13 to an average of less than 1/2

III -6
percentage point in the week ended July 4. The overnight Euro-dollar
rate has been below the Federal funds rate almost continuously since the
middle of June. However on most days this differential has been suffi-
ciently small so that U.S. banks have found overnight Euro-dollar borrowing
subject to the 8 per cent marginal reserve requirement slightly more
expensive than Federal funds borrowing during this period.
U.S. banks have apparently increased their use of Euro-dollars
as a source of funds in response to the reduction in the marginal reserve
requirement rate on Euro-dollar borrowing from 20 to 8 per cent. In the
four weeks ended June 6 (the first computation period during which the
lower rate was in effect) average daily borrowings by U.S. banks from
their foreign branches were $150 million higher than in the previous 4
week period. Some small further increase seems to be indicated by weekly
figures.

U.S. balance of payments. With the exchange rate of the dollar
moving sharply down against continental European currencies, and only
Japan intervening on a substantial scale to avoid a decline in the yen
rate, the traditional over-all measures of balance have relatively
little meaning. For instance, In June the official settlements balance
probably registered a surplus of $1/2 billion or more, representing
primarily sales of dollars by the Japanese authorities but also by non-
G-10 countries; for the second quarter as a whole this balance was a
surplus of perhaps $1-1/2 billion, in contrast to the $10-1/2 billion
deficit (not an annual rate) in the first quarter.
A more meaningful measure under present circumstances would be
the basic balance -- the sum of current and long-term capital transactions --
but it is not yet clear how this balance moved in the second quarter.
In the first quarter, the basic balance was in deficit by $5 billion at
an annual rate, but in the second quarter the rate of deficit on this
basis was probably considerably higher.
The U.S. trade balance for April-May showed considerable improve-
ment (as described below) with the deficit dropping to an annual rate of
$1-1/4 billion compared with a rate of nearly $4 billion in the first
quarter. Some of this improvement was probably offset by a reduced
surplus on income account mainly because of larger interest payments
on U.S. debts.

III -9
However, a major change occurred in private securities trans-
actions, which registered an extraordinarily favorable net inflow of
$1-3/4 billion in the first quarter (not at an annual rate) but were
probably about in balance in the second quarter. In May foreigners sold,
net, about $125 million of U.S. stocks; in April, foreign purchases totaled
about $140 million, and they had averaged about $400 million per month in the
first quarter. Brokers report continued net stocks sales by foreigners in
the first part of June. Sales of offshore U.S. bonds to private foreigners
have also fallen off sharply, following heavy sales through April, and were
reported to be virtually nil in June. U.S. net purchases of foreign
securities continued at a low level in May and June; purchases of new
Canadian bond issues may pick up in the fall as financing is required
for planned new hydro-electric projects in that country.
U.S. bank-reported claims on foreigners rose about $500 million
in April-May, largely for export credits. Preliminary weekly data for
June and early July indicate a further increase in bank claims on
foreigners around mid-June, but no notable movement thereafter. There
was also a sizable buildup during the second quarter of U.S. banks'
liabilities to foreign commercial banks (including foreign branches),
totalling $1.4 billion in April-May, and apparently still rising in
June but at a lesser rate.

III-10
U.S. foreign trade. For May the balance of trade was in
deficit at an annual rate of $3.4 billion (seasonally adjusted,
balance of payments basis). This followed an April surplus of $1.0
billion (annual rate, revised). Thus, for April and May combined
the trade deficit was $1.2 billion at an annual rate, down from $3.8
billion for first quarter 1973 and $6.9 billion for 1972. On a regional
basis, the April-May improvement over the first quarter was dominated
by a $1.1 billion reduction in our deficit with Canada and a $1.9
billion decline in our deficit with Japan (annual rates, Census basis).
The shift from an April surplus to a May deficit reflected
a large increase in the value of imports, which had changed little
during the first four months of the year. While import prices in May
were more than 9 percent higher than in February, when exchange rates
were realigned, the volume of imports, although higher than in April,
was the same as in March and below the January and February levels.
This suggests that the exchange rate realignments, with some help from
supply limitations abroad, held down the rise in import volume that
normally would have accompanied a strong domestic expansion.
Within this pattern of change in the aggregate volume of
imports there were different patterns of growth among broad categories
of imported goods. May import volumes were below first quarter levels
for industrial supplies, automotive vehicles and parts, and consumer
durables. The volume of capital good imports was roughly the same
in May as in February and March, while imports of foods, feeds and

III -11
beverages were almost 4 percent higher in volume than during February
and March. For all these categories, May unit value indices were
substantially higher than in February (when exchange rates were
realigned) -- ranging from 6.4 percent greater for.industrial supplies
to 22.7 percent higher for automotive vehicles and parts from sources
other than Canada.
The value of exports has grown steadily since second quarter
1972. Due to a decline in agricultural shipments, the volume of exports
in May dipped below its April level, although it was still higher than
the volumes exported during the first three months of the year. The
unit value index for exports was 4.3 percent higher in May than in
February.
The volume of non-agricultural exports has increased fairly
steadily during the past year to a May level nearly 25 percent higher
than in May 1972. The unit value of non-agricultural exports in May
was 2 percent higher than in February and 7 1/2 percent greater than
a year earlier. Unfilled orders for exports of machinery, which have
risen steadily throughout 1973, were 5.percent Higher in dollar value
at the end of May than at the end of April, and 28 percent greater than
a year earlier.
Among all categories of trade, the most dramatic changes
have been occurring in agricultural exports, which this year have
represented approximately 25 percent of the total value of U.S. exports.
The unit value of agricultural exports for May was 8 percent greater

III -12
than in April, 14 percent above its February level and 41 percent
higher than in May 1972. The May volume of agricultural exports,
which peaked in March, was down nearly 5 percent from both the April
level and the average volume for first quarter 1973, but nevertheless
was 36 percent higher than a year earlier.
On June 27 the Department of Commerce announced an embargo
on exports of soybeans, soybean oil-cakes and meal, cottonseed, and
cottonseed oil-cakes and meal. The embargo was replaced by a
restrictive licensing system on July 2, which was extended on July 5
to an additional 41 related categories of agricultural commodities,
including edible oils, animal fats, and livestock protein feed. These
controls apply until the end of the current marketing year--end of
August for soybeans; end of September for soybean meal. Their purpose
is to moderate or reverse the price increases that domestic purchasers
have been facing. Contracts for future exports of major grains and
edible oils not subject to licensing are presently being monitored by
reporting requirements, as announced on June 13 (July 6 for cotton).
On July 2 a licensing requirement was also imposed on exports
of ferrous scrap, and the Japanese government announced that it will
license imports of ferrous scrap and defer some purchases until 1974.
We estimate that this will reduce potential 1973 export earnings by
approximately $100 million.
In 1972, exports of the agricultural items now under control
totalled $2.6 billion: $1.5 billion for soybeans, $.4 billion for

111-13
soybean cake and meal, and $.7 billion for the 43 other items combined,
only one of which (tallow) individually exceeded $100 million. The
licensing system will reduce each contract for soybean exports to
50 percent of the quantity originally scheduled for delivery, and
to 40 percent for soybean oil-cake and meal during the 1972/73 marketing
year. This should hold soybean exports for the 1972/73 crop year near
the 490 million bushels we projected last month. It is estimated that
the rescinded exports of soybeans and soybean oil-cake and meal would
have sold for over $400 million at May prices, although evidence of
overselling casts doubt on whether the rescinded contracts could in
fact have been delivered.
Whether an extension of controls will be necessary will, of
course, depend upon the size of the harvest, the level of export demand,
and prices within the United States. Crop estimates released on July
10 are roughly in line with those that underlie the export volumes we
projected last month for the 1973/74 crop year. The monitoring reports
collected by the Department of Commerce indicate that the following
percentages of the projected 1973/74 exports of major crops have
already been sold: wheat, 68; corn, 52; soybeans, 70; soybean meal,
90. Consequently, there is likely to be pressure to extend export
controls into the 1973/74 marketing year. However, such an extension
would not necessarily reduce export shipments below the historically
high rates achieved during the present crop year. Moreover, even if
export volumes fall below projections for 1973/74, export values might
be buoyed by increases in the prices that foreigners offer to pay for
our products.

III -14
Recent developments in monetary policy in selected industrial
countries. Economic activity in almost all industrial countries is
moving along parallel lines to a degree unprecedented in post-war history.
Rates of capacity utilization almost everywhere are nearing -- or
beginning to exceed -- optimum levels, and policy measures generally
are directed towards slowing the pace of expansion and relieving price
pressures. Prices continue to rise rapidly -- and rates of increase
are historically high -- in most countries. For example, recent con-
sumer price increases in the major industrial countries have ranged
from 6 to 21 per cent (annual rates) compared to average increases
ranging from 2 to 5 per cent for the period 1958-59 to 1968-69.
Although some use is being made of price/wage policies, with
emphasis on price policies, and of fiscal instruments, restraint is
mainly being sought through the use of monetary policy. Interest rates
are now at exceedingly high levels in almost all countries, with the
exception of Japan and Italy. (See the table on the following page.)
The main reason why countries have been more or less free to pursue
tighter monetary policies without triggering self-defeating monetary
movements across international exchanges, has been the coincidence of
the cycle among countries. The ability to tighten monetary policy can
be ascribed also, to some extent, to greater exchange rate flexibility
and to a wide variety of restraints on capital movements. But, because

interest rates have been moving in the same direction in almost all
countries, the degree of insulation provided by these new circumstances
has not yet been fully tested.
The main case of conflict between external flows and internal
requirements, has been that of Germany. The agreement among nine
European countries to keep their exchange rates within fixed relation-
ships to each other, removed the insulation provided by exchange rate
flexibility between these countries. Thus, when the DM strengthened
not only against the dollar but also against European currencies, the
Bundesbank was forced to make heavy purchases of the currencies of its
European partners. The unwillingness of the monetary authorities to
continue to provide liquidity to the market through such operations,
coupled with the very strong trade position of Germany, despite repeated
revaluations of the DM, led to the decision on June 29 to revalue the
DM once more.
With the German revaluation and the previously expressed
determination of the EEC ministers to combat inflation, further anti-
inflationary measures have been taken in a number of EEC countries,
as well as in Japan and Canada. (See "Chronology of Monetary Develop-
ments in Major Industrial Countries in 1973," Apendix A.)
Inflation in Germany remains the prime preoccupation of the
German authorities. As elsewhere, rapidly rising food prices have
contributed heavily to the acceleration of the inflation rate, but the

III -17
increases in the non-food comoonents of the consumer and the wholesale
price indexes have also been far above the average of the past decade.
Capacity utilization is now approaching peak levels and unemployment
is down to 1 per cent. Order inflows, particularly to the capital
goods industries, are strong both from domestic and from foreign
customers, and order backlogs are rising.
Under these circumstances, the German authorities have made
vigorous use of demand management instruments, both on the fiscal and
on the monetary side. The stabilization package of last May (see
Appendix to May Greenbook) was followed by a further tightening of
monetary policy on June 1, when the discount rate was raised to 7 per
cent and Lombard lending was virtually suspended.
The Bundesbank's tight money measures have exerted strong
upward pressure on both short- and long-term interest rates in Germany.
The most dramatic rises in interest rates occurred in the day-to-day
money market. On occasion, the call money rate has fallen very low,
but in early April it soared as high as 25 per cent. In mid-April, the
Bundesbank sought to put a ceiling on the call-money rate by introducing
an arrangement under which the Bundesbank agreed to discount domestic
bills offered by the commercial banks at a rate of 12 per cent, with
repurchase mandatory at the end of ten days. The Bundesbank suspended
this arrangement at the end of April -- when liquidity pressures

III -18
eased -- but, with the onset of a new liquidity squeeze, reactivated
it, at a rate of 13 per cent, effective June 7.
There has been some moderation this year in the pace of bank
credit extension. However, this slowing is not primarily a reflection
of tight monetary policy in Germany. It is mainly attributable to the
reduced need for bank credit by German non-bank borrowers because of
the heavy capital inflows in February-March and again in June.
From mid-March, when the DM was allowed to float against the
dollar, to the final days of June, the Bundesbank found that capital
controls coupled with the DM float against the dollar proved a
necessary, though not wholly sufficient condition for implementation
of tight money policies. But when the DM moved to the upper limit of
the EEC snake, heavy support purchases of the snake currencies became
necessary. Because these intervention purchases were jeopardizing the
domestic stabilization program, the German government revalued the DM
against the other currencies in the joint float (by raising the DM value
against SDRs) by 5-1/2 per cent on June 29. This move was facilitated
domestically by the large and rising trade surplus, which materialized
despite the many DM revaluations of recent years.
Economic activity in France has moved along trend lines for
an extended period of time, and capacity utilization is high despite
rather high rates of unemployment. As in other countries, the inflation

III -19
rate has accelerated in recent months reaching an annual rate of 13 per
cent as measured by the wholesale price index.
These developments have led the government to adopt a series
of anti-inflationary measures beginning early this year. Because of
the relatively high rate of unemployment, demand management measures
have concentrated on reducing internal liquidity and have been coupled
with measures aimed directly at reducing price pressures, such as
reductions in indirect taxation and import liberalization.
The latest acceleration in price movements prompted a further
anti-inflation package announced on July 5, which included a discount
rate increase from 7-1/2 to 8-1/2 per cent and a further tightening of
credit restrictions. Ceilings on bank credit expansion were reduced
further, and short-term personal loans by commercial banks were frozen
at their July 3 level, as were loans on residential construction of
second homes. In addition, corporate tax payments will be moved up
from December to October. Other measures included an increase in re-
serve requirements on demand deposits and higher import quotas for
non-EEC countries.
Presumably as a result of the credit restrictions already in
effect, the level of outstanding bank credit in the first quarter of
1973 was 2.6 per cent below the level in the fourth quarter of 1972.
Furthermore, in the first quarter of 1973 the money supply (seasonally
adjusted) rose at an annual rate of only 3.6 per cent.

III -20
In contrast to most other countries, authorities in the
United Kingdom are not pursuing an active policy of monetary restraint,
in spite of the fact that some capacity limitations are being reached
and prices are rising rapidly. Instead, the government is assuming that
economic activity will start to slow on its own as large price rises cut
into real earnings. There is some evidence that a slowdown in consumer
expenditures has already begun, which would allow for expansion in other
private expenditures. Some policy actions have, however, been taken.
Cuts in public expenditures have been announced, partly for this fiscal
year, but mostly for the year beginning in April 1974. The underlying
rate of growth of the money supply has been slowed to about a 15-20 per
cent annual rate -- still high, but below earlier rates of growth. And
the government implemented a price/incomes policy, Phase III of which
is now being discussed with labor and industry.
Also in contrast to other countries, short-term interest rates
in the United Kingdom have been falling, although this partly reflects
an extraordinary rise earlier in the year, and rates still remain high.
A considerable degree of liquidity exists in the economy, for a variety
of reasons which may, however, be temporary. A reluctance to buy long-
term bonds prior to the announcement of Phase III and prior to very
large government financing requirements in the fall, has contributed to the
fall in short-term rates. The Government has welcomed this fall since,

III -21
for political reasons (and to help gain support for its price controls),
a flow of funds into the building societies would be desirable because
of its damping effect on mortgage rates.
Inflation in the Netherlands, as elsewhere, is a major
problem. In contrast to most other countries, however, the Dutch
economy is not operating at or very near full capacity. In fact, un-
employment remains, at least from the political standpoint,
unsatisfactorily high. Consequently, recent monetary policy measures
in the Netherlands have not been directed at fighting inflation through
restraining aggregate demand.
The Netherlands Bank's discount rate was raised by 1/2 per-
centage point at the beginning of June, and by the same amount at the
end of the month -- to 5 per cent -- but these moves were aimed at
halting or slowing capital outflows, not at tightening domestic mone-
tary conditions. At the end of June, to offset the liquidity reducing
effects of the capital outflows -- which were particularly heavy at
the end of the month as speculation about a revaluation of the DM
mounted -- reserve requirements on commercial bank deposits, which have
recently been changed from week to week, were sharply reduced.
It would appear that the burden of any program to slow
inflation will fall upon incomes policy. A price "stop" has been in
effect since last November, but it is a rather loose one, in that cost

III -22
increases can for the most part be passed on, subject to the constraint
that profit margins in absolute terms not be increased. Until the
formation of a rather shaky left-of-center coalition government in May,
after months of negotiations following last year's elections, formula-
tion of any kind of coherent economic policy in the Netherlands was
virtually impossible. Despite the high rates of inflation, the current
account of the Dutch balance of payments remains strong, leaving some
leeway for domestic policy options.
In Japan, the authorities have recently taken several measures
to curb soaring domestic prices and the fast growth of economic activity.
Recent price rises ran at an annual rate of about 20 per cent for both
consumer and wholesale prices. Industrial production (seasonally
adjusted) also rose at an annual rate of 20 per cent in recent months.
On July 2, the Bank of Japan raised its basic discount rate to 6.0
per cent -- the third rate increase this year. Still, the 6.0 per
cent level is not particularly high for Japan by post-war standards,
the rate having generally been in the 5-7 per cent range. In addition
to the discount rate increases, the Bank of Japan has attempted to
reduce bank credit expansion by putting ceilings on the banks' ability
to increase lending: the amount of credit expansion permitted for the
third quarter 1973 is only about three-fourths of that occurring in
the third quarter of 1972.

III -23
Other stabilization measures announced early in July included
a reduction in the rate of public works expenditures and a liberaliza-
tion of agricultural import quotas. For the first half of fiscal 1973
(April-September 1973), the ratio of public works contracts to previously
scheduled expenditures is to be reduced from 60 per cent to 50 per cent.
It is doubtful that the latest tightening measures will have
a reasonably fast braking effect on the rate of inflation. Much of the
upward price pressures stem from soaring international prices of agri-
cultural products and raw materials, and from sharply rising costs of
production for small firms. In addition, the tighter monetary policy
will have little immediate effect on capital spending because of excess
corporate liquidity.
The rapid rate of economic expansion coupled with the high
rates of internal inflation and the revaluation of the yen, have
brought about a decrease in the excess of the volume of exports over
that of imports. The fall in the Japanese trade surplus in recent
months has clearly been a factor in the stability of the floating yen
rate through last week.
In Canada, the strong pace of expansion of economic activity
is continuing. The unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted) has
decreased significantly -- down to 5.2 per cent in May, compared to
an average rate of 6.3 per cent in 1972. Inflation is a severe problem

III -24
in Canada as elsewhere -- wholesale prices are increasing at an annual
rate of 21 per cent and consumer prices at a rate of 8 per cent.
The government's fiscal policy stance remains moderately
expansionary -- the corporate tax cuts and accelerated depreciation
allowances first announced 14 months ago passed Parliament on July 5
(retroactive to January 1) with a compromise provision for review
early next year. However, corporate planners have generally made invest-
ment decisions assuming the measures would be enacted so no additional
stimulus is expected now.
As in most of the other countries, monetary policy has
become more restrictive. Effective June 11, and following the announce-
ment of a U.S. discount rate increase, the Bank of Canada raised the
bank rate to 6.25 per cent. This was the third increase in two months,
producing a total rise of 1-1/2 percentage points. The Bank's policy
aim is to bring about a moderation in the extraordinarily rapid growth
of bank credit, which has been at an annual rate of about 30 per cent
so far this year. In response to the increase in the bank rate, the
chartered banks raised the prime lending rate to 7.75 per cent, the
fourth increase since early April.
