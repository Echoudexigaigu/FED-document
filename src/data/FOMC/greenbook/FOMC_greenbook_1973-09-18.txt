Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

At annual rate. 4/ Commerce survey

I- 1
DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Incoming data this quarter suggest somewhat more rapid expansion
in real GNP than the reduced second quarter pace, and a continued sharp
run-up in prices. GNP growth for the quarter is now projected to be some-
what larger than in the August Greenbook.
Consumer spending for goods, particularly for nondurables,
averaged appreciably higher in July and August than in the second quatter,
even after allowance for sharply higher prices. August retail sales,
according to the advance Commerce estimate, remained at the high July
level, and the average for the two months was 3-1/4 per cent above that
of the second quarter. However, total auto sales declined somewhat in
August to an annual rate of 11.3 million units, moderately below the
average for the first seven months of the year.
Business demands for fixed capital remain strong. The latest
Commerce survey, mainly taken in August, indicates a rise of 13 per cent
for the year, the same as in the preceding survey. More of the rise is
now indicated for the second half of the year, however, as outlays in the
second quarter fell short of anticipations--probably due to supply and
capacity limitations. The Conference Board survey of large manufacturers
showed another substantial increase in new capital appropriations during
the second quarter, and unspent appropriations rose further. Moreover,
new and unfilled orders for nondefense capital goods extended their rise
in July. On the other hand, inventory investment has remained quite
moderate and stock/sales ratios have declined further from already low
levels.

I-2
Capacity utilization rates in major materials industries
remain at very advanced levels. A slight decline in industrial pro-
duction in August resulted from parts shortages, extremely hot weather,
and some wildcat strikes which sharply curtailed auto and truck assemblies.
In other areas, including output of business equipment, production
increased moderately further. Assuming no strike against Chrysler when
the contract expires September 14, industrial output is likely to re-
bound this month.
Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in August, following
two months of small increases. On balance, there has been a distinct
slowing of the earlier expansion, largely concentrated in manufacturing
industries. The factory workweek declined somewhat in August, to the
June level. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.8 per cent.
The August rise in average hourly earnings was moderate, but
figures for June and July have been revised substantially upward. In
consequence, the over-all rise in the private nonfarm hourly earnings
index in recent months has been somewhat more rapid than earlier this
year. In August, the index was 6-1/2 per cent above the level of a year
earlier.
Wholesale prices of farm products and processed foods rose by
a record 19 per cent from July to August, to a level almost 50 per cent
above a year earlier. Part of this increase apparently was of specu-
lative origin; since the August pricing date, prices of some of these
commodities have declined appreciably, but they still remain far above
mid-July levels. Wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose 0.4

I-3
per cent in August, even though the pricing date came only 2 days after
the ending of the freeze on August 12, The increases were widespread,
and were presumably made by firms not subject to the prenotification
requirements of Phase IV. Food prices at retail are likely to be up
sharply in August.
Outlook. The staff GNP projection continues to assume growth
in the monetary aggregates consistent with the longer-run rates agreed
to at the June Committee meeting. Market interest rates in the months
ahead are assumed to remain around current advanced levels. The assump-
tions with respect to Federal expenditures for the fiscal year remain
essentially unchanged.
For the second half of this year and the first half of 1974,
the staff has raised by an average of about 1/2 percentage point its
projection of the annual rate of increase in both nominal and real GNP.
An important factor is the additional strength expected in business
fixed capital spending, as evidenced in recent figures on manufacturers'
appropriations, new orders, and the latest plant and equipment survey.
Real growth is now projected at an annual rate of 4 per cent
in the third quarter and 3 per cent in the fourth. The third quarter
represents a little more thrust in consumer expenditures as well as in
business fixed investment. Partially offsetting the greater strength
in these sectors is an apparent decline in defense spending and, on the
basis of very limited information, a smaller rise estimated for inven-
tory investment. The somewhat more rapid growth in real GNP now
projected for the fourth quarter results primarily from a rebound in
defense purchases from the reduced third quarter rate.

I-4
The private fixed weight price index is now projected to rise
at an annual rate of close to 7 per cent in the third quarter in view
of the sharper-than-expected increases in food prices at retail. In
the fourth quarter, food prices are not expected to rise as rapidly, but
prices of other commodities are likely to bulge as cost increases are
passed on, as is permitted by Phase IV.
In the first half of 1974, continued gains in business fixed
capital spending should help to sustain inventory investment. Projected
growth rates in other major demand categories have been changed relatively
little. Housing starts and residential construction activity are still
expected to be down sharply, owing in large part to stringency in mortgage
markets, and net exports are still expected to rise appreciably further.
The projection for the second half of 1974 is basically the same as that
of four weeks ago. From late 1973 to late 1974, real GNP is now pro-
jected to increase 1.5 per cent, a little more than last time. The
unemployment rate is still shown to increase from 4.7 per cent in the
fourth quarter of this year to 5.5 per cent in late 1974.
Our price projections for 1974 remain unchanged. Increasing
unit labor costs are expected to exert upward pressure on prices through-
out the year, but the rise in food prices seems likely to moderate.

Industrial production. Industrial production was off 0.2
per cent in August because of a 23 per cent drop in auto and truck
assemblies. The August index at 126.2 per cent of the 1967 average
was 8.5 per cent above a year earlier. Output of consumer durable
goods declined because of the reduction in auto production and the rise
in business equipment was slowed by the fall in truck output. Production
of industrial materials rose only slightly as capacity limitations
hampered further expansion.
Auto assemblies for August were scheduled at 800,000 units,
an annual rate of 10.3 million units and the same as in July, but parts
shortages, extreme heat, and wildcat strikes curtailed actual production
to 470,000 cars, an annual rate of 8.0 million units. In early Sep-
tember, auto output rose sharply. Output of household appliances,
television sets, and furniture was maintained at record levels in
August while production of nondurable consumer goods advanced further.
Output of business equipment excluding trucks, rose 1.8
per cent, but because of the 25 per cent drop in truck assemblies, total
business equipment rose only 0.3 per cent. Truck production, as in the
case of autos, increased sharply in early September. Output of
construction products rose in August, but production of steel, other
durable goods materials, and nondurable materials were up only marginally.
Retail sales. Sales in August remained at the high July
level and were 3.2 per cent above the second quarter average. August
sales at durable stores were up slightly from July, largely as a result
of strong sales of furniture and appliances and relatively good sales

I -11
of other durables and nonconsumer items. Outlays for nondurables were
little changed. Compared with the second quarter average, sales were
up 2.5 per cent for durables and 3.6 per cent for nondurables; the auto,
food, and furniture and appliances groups were all up over 3 per cent.
The gain in general merchandise sales from the second quarter, however,
was only about 1 per cent. Total retail sales in August were up 12.5
per cent from a year earlier.

Unit sales of consumer goods. Sales of new domestic-type
autos in August were at a 9.7 million unit annual rate, down a little
from both July and the average rate for the first 7 months of 1973.
Auto stocks, at a 47 day supply by the end of the month, were off
11 per cent from July due to sharply reduced production.
Foreign car sales in August were at a 1.6 million unit
annual rate, 11 per cent below July and a continuation of the downtrend
evident since the first quarter. Total new car sales were at a 11.3
million unit rate with imports amounting to 13.8 per cent of the total
as compared with 14.3 per cent a year earlier.
August factory sales of major appliances, TVs, and radios
are estimated to have risen 4 per cent from July. Appliance sales
were up 8 per cent, but all components of the index, except air condi-
tioners, equaled or exceeded their July levels. TV sales declined
3 per cent, however, sales of radios--which represent only a small
share of expenditures in the home good total--were up.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place changed little in August at a peak
annual rate of $139 billion. Outlays for industrial plants and other
private nonresidential construction, which accounted for all of the
over-all advance in recent months, apparently continued upward in
August to another recored. But outlays for private residential and
public construction remained somewhat below their early year highs.
All of the aggregate increase in current dollars since the
first quarter has reflected cost increases. As a result, total con-
struction outlays in constant dollars in August remained moderately
under the first quarter average. At 150 per cent of the 1967 average,
the construction cost index in August was 8 per cent above a year
earlier, compared with year-to-year increases of 7 per cent in the
previous two years as a whole.

Anticipated plant and equipment spending. The Commerce
September survey of planned spending for new plant and equipment (taken
in late July and August) indicates an increase of 13.2 per cent for 1973--
the same as in the June survey. Manufacturers now plan an increase of
19.4 per cent, compared to the earlier 18.5 per cent, with most of the
additional strength in nondurable goods. Outside of manufacturing, a
rise of 9.9 per cent is scheduled--down slightly from the June anticipa-
tion.
Second quarter spending was $0.8 billion less than planned--
with the shortfall about evenly split between durable goods manufacturing
and nonmanufacturing--resulting in an upward adjusted third quarter
increase larger than that of the second quarter. The survey indicates
that spending in the fourth quarter will increase a bit more slowly than
in the third quarter, but that the second quarter shortfall will be made
up by the end of the year.

This latest Commerce survey indicates somewhat less strength
in business capital spending, especially in manufacturing, than is
suggested by other measures. New orders for capital goods have been
quite strong and unfilled orders are rising. In addition, newly
approved capital appropriations by manufacturing firms rose 11.2 per
cent in the second quarter according to the Conference Board.
(Historically, appropriations tend to be spent in about two to three
quarters.) Backlogs of unspent appropriations also rose sharply in
the second quarter and could now support spending at the second
quarter rate for another four quarters.

I -16
Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods were off slightly in July (p) following an upward-revised gain
of 1.3 per cent in June. Defense capital goods orders were off almost
50 per cent in July reflecting turn of fiscal year volatility.
Excluding defense, orders rose by 1.9 per cent. Orders for motor
vehicles and construction-type goods rebounded from their June declines,
and nondefense capital goods orders were up 0.6 per cent, compared with
a 4.5 per cent rise in June.
For the second quarter as a whole, durable goods new orders
rose at a 5.7 per cent rate following a 6.3 per cent increase in the
first quarter.
Shipments of durable goods rose strongly (4.3 per cent) in
July. Backlogs of unfilled orders rose 1.8 per cent,a slowing from the
strong advances of recent months.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturers' inventories rose
at an annual rate of $11.4 billion in July (p), less than the June rate
of $16.8 billion but about the same as the second quarter average.
Wholesale trade inventories rose at a $4.6 billion rate in July--up
from the downward revised $3.6 billion second quarter rate. By stage
of fabrication in manufacturing, materials stocks rose at an accelerated
$9.5 billion annual rate, while work in process rose moderately and
finished goods stocks declined. Despite these large additions to
book value, it appears that manufacturers may not have increased the
physical volume of their stocks either in July or in the second quarter.
Although the data indicate increases in manufacturers' holdings of
materials--which appears consistent with recent purchasing agents'
reports--there have been continued declines in finished goods.
Since the price freeze was in effect for many products during July
the rapid rate of shipments and the drawing-down of finished goods
stocks may reflect some buying in anticipation of higher prices in
subsequent months.

Manufacturers' shipments increased by a substantial 2.8 per
cent in July and the inventory-shipments ratio declined from 1.58 in
June to 1.55 in July, the lowest level since 1951. The ratio of
inventories to unfilled orders declined further, reaching the lowest
level since October 1969. The wholesale trade inventory-shipments ratio
declined slightly to 1.14 in July, continuing at a low level.

Cyclical indicators. The Census composite index of leading
indicators rose 1.1 per cent in July (p), following increases of 1.0
per cent in June and 1.9 per cent in May. The coincident and lagging
indexes also rose.

Leading series increasing in July were the manufacturing
workweek, initial claims for unemployment insurance (inverted),
industrial materials prices, and common stock prices. Series declining
were new orders for durable goods, contracts and orders for plant and
equipment, housing permits, and the ratio of price to unit labor cost
in manufacturing.
Labor market. Nonfarm payroll employment rose by nearly
300,000 in August on the strength of large increases in service-type
industries. As in other recent months, employment rose only slightly
in goods producing industries. Total employment and the labor force

I -20
were down slightly and the unemployment rate, at 4.8 per cent, was
up 0.1 per cent from July.
Since May, growth of both labor force and employment has
been considerably slower than earlier. Payroll employment increased
at a 1.9 million annual rate from May to August, a more sustainable
rate than the 3.1 million rate in the preceeding nine months. The
slowing was mainly in manufacturing, where job gains slipped to an
annual rate of 115,000 from an extraordinary rate of 1.1 million. In
August, manufacturing employment was little changed and the factory
workweek fell 0.2 hour, to 40.6 hours.

Unemployment. As with the total figure, unemployment was
little changed for major groups, except for Negroes whose rate dropped

back to the June level. Jobless rates continue significantly below a
year earlier for most groups and in some instances are down appreci-
ably from earlier this year. Over the past year, the number of
unemployed has decreased by 660,000 with declines in the number of
job losers accounting for the bulk of the reduction--a typical cyclical
pattern.

Earnings and collective bargaining. The index of hourly
earnings for production workers in private nonfarm activities rose at
a 4.7 per cent annual rate in August, following upward revised annual
rates of increase of 10 per cent in June and 8 per cent in July. The
index, which moves unevenly on a monthly basis, was 6.5 per cent above
a year earlier and now appears to be rising at a more rapid rate than
earlier this year.

I -22
Consumer prices. The rise in consumer prices slowed from
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7 per cent in June to only 2.8
per cent in July, largely because of reimposition of price ceilings
June 13. Because of reporting lags, the July index includes some price
changes which actually occurred before the freeze. Annual rates of rise
dropped to about 6 per cent for food, 1 per cent for other commodities
and 2.6 per cent for services.

Despite the freeze, which, unlike the previous one, covered
raw foods after the farm level, prices of most foods did rise. The
increases were less than seasonal for meats and eggs but particularly
large for fresh vegetables.
The August index for food will reflect much of the enormous
advance registered at wholesale following authorization on July 18 of
a pass-through of raw agricultural product cost increases (except
for beef).
More generally, the bulge in price increases following the
ending of the freeze for most items around mid-August when Phase IV
went into effect should be most evident in the consumer price index in
September and the fourth quarter. Prenotification regulations will
delay the implementation of price increases for large companies and the
index will continue to reflect price change with some lags. Although
the regulations generally permit only a dollar-for-dollar pass-through
of costs, increases are expected to be large, particularly for apparel.
However, these may be offset in part by some rollbacks in gasoline
prices and by the BLS adjustment for quality change on new cars which
may equal or exceed the authorized price increase.
Recent advances in mortgage rates, which are reflected in
the CPI with a lag, will also boost the index in coming months through
their effect on the homeownership costs component. During the last
period of rising mortgage rates, there were quarters when mortgage costs
contributed anywhere from 1/2 to 1 percentage point (annual rate) to
the increase in the CPI.

I -24
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose between July and
August by 6.2 per cent, seasonally adjusted, to a level 19 per cent
above a year earlier. This was the largest monthly increase since
October 1946 and resulted mainly from a surge in prices of farm and food
products, although prices of industrial commodities also rose further.
Price increases for farm and food products were widespread
and the index for this group rose 19.3 per cent, seasonally adjusted,
as huge increases were posted for grains, livestock, meat, poultry,
manufactured animal feeds, soybeans, and eggs. Consumer foods rose
almost 11 per cent, reflecting large advances for almost all major food
groups.

products, paper products, textile products and apparel, machinery and
equipment, lumber and wood products, and furniture and appliances were

Since August 14, prices of farm products have shown a sharp
decline, particularly for grains, eggs, soybeans, livestock, and poultry.
An exception has been raw cotton which is about 25 per cent higher than
at mid-August. Even though they have dropped markedly, farm product
prices remain substantially above mid-July levels.
The Cost-of-Living Council recently gave approval to auto-
mobile manufacturers to increase prices by $51-$74 a vehicle on 1974-
model cars and trucks. These increases, less than requested, are to
cover costs of government-mandated safety and pollution-control equip-
ment. One automobile manufacturer was also permitted to raise prices
to cover the addition of some equipment, now standard, which was formerly
optional at additional cost; this increase together with the increase to

I -26
cover safety and pollution-control devices resulted in a total increase
of $136 a unit or about 3 per cent.
Steel companies were granted approval this week to increase
steel sheet prices about 5 per cent, with no more than one-half of the
increase to be effective on October 1 and the remainder on January 1.
The Council announced that it will not consider requests for price
increases on other steel products before December 1.
In another action, the Cost-of-Living Council suspended
requests submitted by manufacturers for price increases for tires,
paper products, and soap and detergents pending public hearings on the
manufacturers' requests.
Agriculture. Prices received by farmers increased 20 per cent
during the month ending August 15, but about half this rise has since
been erased by a general price decline. Both livestock and grain
prices shared in the sharp rise and decline even though underlying
supply conditions--animal slaughter and crop prospects--continue about
the same.
Livestock slaughter was low throughout August and early
September, resulting in red meat production about 7 per cent below the
July level, and 17 per cent below August last year. A small increase
in hog slaughter was less than the usual seasonal rise. Shopper resis-
tance to high prices, consumption of stocks built up earlier in expec-
tation of high prices, and hot weather have caused meat supplies to
accumulate in marketing channels and were major factors pushing down
prices of farm products.

I -27
Estimates of corn, spring wheat, soybean, and cotton pro-
duction have each been raised between 2 and 4 per cent based on
September 1 crop conditions. Slackening export commitments had already
caused some decline in grain markets and further weakness may result
from this latest report. Soybean export restrictions have been lifted
and previous contracts can be fully met.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
The rally in bond markets which began in early August con-
tinued through the first week of September, reducing coupon yields 50
to 100 basis points below their highs in early August. Several factors
combined to initiate and then extend this rally. Most important was
the growing belief on the part of market participants--encouraged by
weakness in the monetary aggregates and the international strength of
the dollar--that monetary policy would not tighten further and that
perhaps the peak in monetary restraint had passed. The effects of
this shift in market attitude were reinforced by the strong technical
position of securities markets, light new corporate bond offerings,
and shifts of funds by individuals from thrift accounts to market
securities.
Shortly after the last Committee meeting, the Treasury bill
market began to share the bond market's more bullish atmosphere, and
rates on these issues declined as much as 20 to 35 basis points. But
other short-term rates remained stable or edged higher during this
period. Most recently, indications of continued monetary restraint--
including some further rise in the Federal funds rate and the announce-
ment of higher marginal reserve requirements on CD's--tended to force
some reconsideration by market participants of the underlying outlook
for interest rates. As a result, bill rates rose to levels above
those prevailing at the time of the mid-August meeting and in the
first two days of this week yields in the Treasury coupon market
generally advanced about 10-25 basis points below their lows.

II -2
In August, outflows from S&L's accelerated to an estimated
$1.5 billion (confidential), but disintermediation at the MSB's appears
to have moderated somewhat from the July pace. FHL Bank net advances
to S&L's, at $1.2 billion, were as large as in July, even though
FHLBB policy on advances tightened further. In this environment, new
mortgage commitments are reported to have declined further in August,
with residential mortgage rates rising--in those states not restricted
by usury ceilings--by over 50 basis points.
Both thrift institutions and banks issued a significant volume
of the new four year certificates in July and August. At commercial
banks, passbook savings declined and inflows of consumer time deposits
other than the four year certificates moderated significantly over this
two month period, reflecting switches to the new deposit form. While
little of the bank gain appears to have been at the expense of thrift
institutions--with most depository institutions offering about the
same rates on four year certificates--bank inflows of total consumer-
type deposits accelerated in August as households realigned their
financial asset holdings in response to the higher level of bank
offering rates.
Business loans expanded further in the month of August. At
weekly reporting banks such loans rose sharply early in the month
and then dropped back in the last two weeks at money market centers.
Discussion with representative commercial banks failed to provide a
clear-cut explanation for the late August weakness, although there
was some indication that firmer lending policies and higher bank
interest rates were both playing a role.

II -3
Outlook. Credit demand pressures over the months ahead are
still expected to focus more on short- and intermediate-term markets
than on long-term markets. Underwriters continue to report very
light forward calendars in the long-term corporate bond market and
no pick-up is expected in the tax-exempt market. If there are con-
tinuing indications that monetary policy is moving in a more restric-
tive direction, however, long-term yields could adjust upward as
lenders become more reluctant to commit funds.
The short- and intermediate-term market areas are likely to
have to absorb about $10 to $12 billion of new Treasury and agency
offerings between now and year-end. This volume would be somewhat
less than in similar periods of recent years, but it may be larger
than some market participants now expect.
Credit demands from the Treasury and Federal agencies proba-
bly will be accompanied by fairly sizable demand for money market funds
by banks and corporations. The forward thrust of business expansion,
in conjunction with a continued preference for short- rather than
long-term financing, may well induce corporations to continue
borrowing from banks and to sell liquid assets or step up commercial
paper offerings as banks enforce tighter lending standards. Banks
in turn will still likely press CD offerings on the market, although
the amount will be restrained in some degree by the recent increase
in marginal reserve requirements.
Outflows of funds from nonbank thrift institutions are
expected to slacken in the months ahead on the assumption that a
large part of interest-sensitive funds have already shifted. Unless
short- and intermediate-term interest rates drop significantly from current
levels, however, these institutions--and in consequence the mortgage markets-
are likely to remain under pressure.

II -4
Monetary aggregates. There was considerable diversity in
the movements of the major monetary aggregates in August. M1, after
showing a slower rise in July, is estimated to have declined on
average over the month at almost a 2 per cent annual rate. With
growth in consumer-type time deposits accelerating sharply, M2
expanded more rapidly than in July, but outflows at the nonbank
thrift institutions were so large in August that M3 growth decelerated
further.
A large part of the July-August growth in commercial bank
time and savings deposits other than CD's was accounted for by increases
in the new four year time deposits exempt from Regulation Q ceilings.
Based on estimates from the July sample survey of IPC time and savings
deposit rates, and from a special smaller survey conducted in August,
it is estimated that all insured banks issued $2.7 billion of new four
year deposits in July and an even larger amount in August (single day
end of month basis, not seasonally adjusted). Most banks at the end
of July were offering these deposits in the 7 to 7-1/2 per cent range,
about the same as competing S&L's, thus making it unlikely that much
of the bank gain was at the expense of thrift institutions.1/ But,
banks--in contrast to the thrift institutions--apparently continued to
enjoy significant net inflows of total consumer time deposits over the
period, though the inflows seemed to be moderating in late August and
early September.

time deposit rate structure as of the end of July.

Outstanding negotiable CD's also rose rapidly on average in
August with offering rates reaching 10.75 to 11.0 per cent by the end
of the month. The rate of inflow, however, slowed later in the month
and in early September, as some banks become less aggressive issuers
when loan demands moderated (see below). Growth in use of funds from
nondeposit sources also slowed late in August, when the increase was
$600 million compared with $900 million in July.
With total time deposits increasing at a 20 per cent rate
and with both nondeposit funds and Treasury deposits rising, the
adjusted credit proxy accelerated to a 16.5 per cent annual rate of
growth in August--somewhat above the rate in the first half of the year.
Bank credit. The rate of growth of loans and investments at
all commercial banks (last Wednesday-of-the month series) also picked
up in August, to around a 20 per cent annual rate. For the second
consecutive month all of the increase reflected loan expansion, as
liquidation of Treasury issues more than offset purchases of other
securities. Since the beginning of the year, banks have reduced their
total security holdings--particularly short-term issues--by over $2
billion. The general reduction in liquid asset holdings accompanied
by continued increases in deposit liabilities carried the liquidity
ratio of large banks in August to the lowest level since mid-1971.

All categories of loans, seasonally adjusted, were strong in
August. Bank loans to finance companies, nonbank thrift institutions,
mortgage companies and security dealers all rose by relatively large
amounts. Consumer loans increased near the average pace of 1972 and
the first half of 1973, and growth in real estate loans has been
maintained near the strong pace established during the 1971-72 period

of expansive monetary policy. To a significant extent the strength in
real estate loans reflects take-downs of previous commitments, but
there have been reports that, when not constrained by usury ceilings,
many banks--with their fund inflows strong and mortgage yields high--
have sought to maintain their credit flows to the mortgage market.
Business loans increased particularly rapidly in August,
with seasonally adjusted growth at an annual rate in excess of 30 per
cent, but this rate of growth appears to be biased upward--perhaps
significantly--by a changing late summer seasonal pattern. Moreover,
in the last two weeks of the month these loans declined sharply, before
adjustment--particularly in New York and Chicago.
Contacts with representative large banks in Boston, New York,
and Chicago regarding the weakness of business loans after mid-month
produced a somewhat mixed picture regarding possible explanations--as
well as a few expressions of puzzlement as to the cause of the weakness.
Some banks felt that the weakness was temporary, others felt that loan
demand was moderating, possibly in response to higher-interest rates,
and still others saw the decline as a lagged reaction to firmer lending
policies they had established earlier. While some bankers made reference
to the increasing relative attractiveness of rates in the commercial
paper market, there is no indication of a shift by nonfinancial corpora-
tions to that market even though finance companies did increase their
commercial paper borrowing significantly in August. Although not given
as an explanation by any respondent, loans to foreign businesses in
August were weak at the large banks, possibly reflecting both the
strengthening of the dollar and the sharp rise in U. S. interest rates.

II -9
Nonbank financial institutions. Estimates based on sample
data, unadjusted for seasonal, indicate that August was the second
consecutive month in which savings and loan associations and mutual
savings banks experienced substantial net deposit outflows. At S&L's,
the pattern of outflows accelerated as the month progressed; confidential
FHLBB estimates show deposit outflows of $300 million in the first
10 days of August, $500 million in the second 10 days, and $700 million
during the last part of the month. This estimated $1.5 billion outflow
translates into a 3.0 per cent seasonally adjusted rate of attrition
for the whole month. Moreover, August marked the first time on
record that S&L's have experienced a net deposit outflow during a
non-reinvestment period month.
On the basis of sample data from New York mutual savings
banks, it is estimated that there was no net deposit growth, seasonally
adjusted, at MSB's during August. New York State savings banks had a
net deposit loss of over $300 million during August--less than the
$472 million loss in July--with a heavy concentration of deposit
withdrawals reportedly around the date of the recent Treasury financing
on August 24.

S&L's continued to borrow heavily from the Federal Home
Loan Banks during August. Although the net increase in advances began
to taper off during the middle part of the month, volume rose again
thereafter, resulting in a net increase of about $1.2 billion for
August as a whole.
Although firm data are not yet available for August,
preliminary reports indicate that both S&L's and MSB's continued to
draw down liquid assets and to reduce mortgage commitments. At the
same time, reflecting the still heavy volume of mortgage commitments
outstanding, total mortgage portfolios of these institutions apparently
expanded somewhat further.

II -11
Consumer credit. The net increase in total consumer credit
outstanding during July amounted to $26.2 billion, seasonally adjusted
annual rate, compared with $24.8 billion in June and the peak of $29.6
billion in December 1972, Both extensions and repayments of instalment
debt rose sharply, and instalment credit outstanding rose at a near-
record pace. Gains in automobile and nonautomotive consumer goods
credit reflected the advanced level of retail sales in July; personal
loans were bolstered by a change in the New York State small loan law
which increased the maximum loan size to $2,500 from $1,400,

Interest rates on most types of consumer credit at commercial
banks and finance companies rose slightly from June to July. Rates on
new car loans edged up 2 basis points at banks and 8 basis points at
finance companies, extending the modest uptrend that has been evident
since mid-1972. Commercial bank rates for new car loans have risen
14 basis points from their low in May 1972; finance company rates are
up 18 basis points from their July 1972 low.

Commercial paper outstanding. Total commercial paper
outstanding showed a record increase of $2.1 billion during August
on a seasonally adjusted basis. Nonbank-related directly placed
issuers reported a record increase in their paper, and bank-related
paper is estimated to have increased a sizable $600 million,
The rapid expansion of directly placed nonbank paper
apparently reflected both a continuing large need for funds to
finance expanding portfolios of receivables and a leveling off in
the advance of interest rates. However, dealer placed nonbank paper
declined $500 million in August, Dealers report that only a few
issuers have returned to the commercial paper market even though the
rate advantage in borrowing at banks has been eliminated for some
borrowers as a result of the recent rapid rise in the prime rate.

Long-term security markets. On balance, yields on long-term
securities have declined substantially since early August. In the
corporate market, the new issue Aaa utility yield showed a net decline
of nearly 60 basis points over the period, while the corresponding
recently offered yield dropped 30 basis points. In the tax exempt
market, yields on long-term securities fell about 40 basis points. The
rally in long-term markets appears to have been prompted initially by
dealer covering of short positions, but was sustained by increased
demands for securities by institutional investors supplemented by some
individual interest at a time of moderating new issue volume. Some of
this demand is due to widening expectations that long-term interest
rates have peaked. Since the Board's change in marginal reserve
requirements on large CD's, prices in the secondary market have declined,
and one new issue that was priced aggressively did not sell well.
New issues of corporate public bonds in August are estimated
to have amounted to about $750 million, the lowest monthly volume since
August 1969. While August is normally a month of relatively light
volume the calendar failed to build up to expectations as the month
progressed, and the decline from July was more than seasonal. In
September, the projected volume of public bonds--$800 million--is only
a little higher than August even with a $200 million negotiated issue
tentatively scheduled near month end. Although underwriters continue

October volume is

Funds raised by Corporations through sales of stock are also
projected to increase from the unusually low volume in August. The
reduced August volume was heavily influenced by postponements of

II -15
scheduled utility issues due to declining stock prices. Stock prices
fell throughout most of August, reached new lows for the year and
recovered slightly at the end of the month. Trading volume was
moderate. Many of the postponed offerings have been rescheduled for
September and October, and account for the rise in projected stock
issues for these months. While poor market conditions could cause a
significant volume of further postponements, the utilities seem to be
running out of financial flexibility and will find it increasingly
difficult to delay scheduled offerings.

The volume of tax exempt bond offerings in August amounted to
about $1.5 billion, a somewhat larger than seasonal decline from July.
In both September and October volume is projected at $1.8 billion, about
in line with earlier months this year.

II -16
State and local governments remain in a strong financial
position and their financing in long-term markets continues relatively
moderate. The volume of new tax exempt issues is being sustained by
an increasing number of industrial pollution control bond issues, the
proceeds of which are ultimately channelled to the corporate sector.

II -16a
Short-term markets. Since the last FOMC meeting, short-term
interest rates have increased on balance, with most market rates rising
about 10 to 25 basis points and bank prime rates, continuing to move
into closer alignment with the general structure of short-term rates,
advancing 50 basis points to 9.75 per cent.
The extended up-trend in short-term interest rates was
interrupted temporarily following the August FOMC meeting by a market
rally which was centered primarily in the Treasury bill sector of the
market but which also developed with a lag in other market sectors.
This rally appeared to be sparked by a shift in market participants'
interest rate outlook, as they apparently concluded, after noting the
weakness displayed by incoming data on the money supply, that the FOMC
had decided at its August meeting to forego a further tightening of
monetary policy. The downward rate pressures generated by this shift
in attitude were reinforced by a low level of dealer bill inventories,
good news regarding the international position of the dollar, and the
persistence of demands from individuals for bills and other market
securities. (Non-competitive bids in recent weekly bill auctions have
been running $200-300 million higher than in the early part of this year.)
The money market displayed a somewhat firmer tone in the last
two weeks of August, however, as reflected by a further increase in
the federal funds rate of about 25 basis points to a level around
10.75 per cent. Then, in response to the System's announcement on
September 7 of a further 3 percentage point increase in marginal
reserve requirements for CD's, short-term interest rates began moving
significantly higher, particularly Treasury bill rates.

Treasury coupon and federal agency issues. Yields in all maturity
sectors of the Treasury coupon market dropped significantly further
following the August meeting of the FOMC, but most recently have
backed up to some extent. These yield movements mainly reflect the
swings in the market's interest rate outlook discussed in the preceding
section. Despite the recent increases, yields generally are down about
20 to 30 basis points from levels prevailing at the time of the

August meeting and about 50 to 100 basis points from their peak levels
of the year reached in early August.

The continued bullish outlook prevailing in the Treasury
coupon market in late August provided a highly receptive setting for
the Treasury's auction of a 25-month note on August 24. The Treasury
set the coupon on this issue at 8-3/8 per cent in an attempt to assume
comfortable coverage. However, interest in the note was quite strong,
and the average yield set in the auction was 7.94 per cent. Demands
by small savers--noncompetitive tenders amounted to $500 million--
provided a major source of strength for this issue.
It now appears that the Treasury may have to raise around $4
billion of new cash between now and year-end, a somewhat larger volume
than had been expected a few weeks ago. Possibly about half this
amount will be offered in early October.
Total borrowing by Federal Agencies through the end of the
year--including financial asset sales as well as new offerings of the
Federally sponsored and budget agencies may amount to about $6.0 billion.
About $2.0 billion of Agency financing already accomplished in September

II -19
is not included in the $6.0 billion figure. Despite this large pros-
pective borrowing by Federal Agencies, the combined Agency-Treasury
need in prospect over the remainder of the calendar year is still
smaller than comparable totals recorded in similar periods of other
recent years.
Mortgage market. New mortgage commitments at savings and
loan associations were again sharply reduced during August, according
to preliminary indications. At the end of July the seasonally ad-
justed backlog of outstanding commitments (including loans in process)
was $18.6 billion. Although still quite large by historical standards,
this amount was 14 per cent below the February peak.
Interest rates in the primary market for conventional home
mortgages continued strongly upward in late August and early September.
The rate on 80 per cent home loans reported in the FHLMC weekly survey
of 120 S&L's rose 11 basis points during the week ending September 7.
At 8.77 per cent, the rate was 59 basis points higher than at the end
of July. For the third successive week respondents in all 12 FHLB
districts reported that funds for home mortgages were in short supply.
In the secondary mortgage market, yields have also increased
sharply since the end of July. In the September 4 FNMA bi-weekly
auction of forward commitments to purchase 8.50 per cent FHA/VA
loans, the average yield on offerings accepted by FNMA was 9.27 per
cent--up 32 basis points from the previous auction and the highest
yield since June 1970. Offerings in the September 4 auction were the
largest for any auction since August 1971. In FNMA's associated auction

II -20
of forward commitments to purchase high loan-to-value ratio conven-
tional mortgages, the average yield on accepted bids was 26 basis
points above the previous auction. However, owing in part to usury
ceiling constraints--now a major problem in at least 24 states--and
revived competition from FHA/VA mortgages which benefited from a
3/4 per cent increase in the regulatory ceiling rate effective on
August 25, the volume of offerings of conventional mortgages was
below that in other recent auctions.
The delinquency rate on home mortgages (MBA series) in the
second quarter, at 3.8 per cent of outstanding loans held by reporting
institutions, was somewhat above the first quarter level. However,
the rate was still well below the peak registered in the fourth quarter
of last year. The highest delinquency rates continued to involve
FHA loans, especially those related to subsidy programs.

Agricultural credit. Preliminary estimates indicate that
outstanding nonmortgage farm loans at banks on June 30 were 17 per cent
above a year earlier--the largest percentage increase since 1951.
A significant part of this increase occurred in the last half of 1972,
when outstanding loans rose by 5 per cent whereas in most years there
is little change during this period. The remaining gain of 11 per cent
over the first half of 1973 was not unusual, as first-half increases
during the last 10 years averaged 9.6 per cent. The first-half gain
pales in comparison with percentage increases experienced in the other
postwar farm super-boom years, for example, 1946-48 and 1951, when
first-half gains ranged between 22 and 26 per cent.
While banks experienced above-average farm loan growth,
the increase in outstanding loans at production credit associations
was weak relative to historical experience. Since increased amounts of
funds were readily available to most farmers from the latter source, it
is evident that much of the large increase in farm production expenses
this year has through choice been financed internally. Also, for the
farm sector as a whole, part of the rise in expenses consisted of
price increases on farm-produced inputs, such as feed and feeder
livestock, and therefore did not generate a need for external financing.
The principal institutional farm mortgage lenders recorded
considerably varied experiences in the year ended June 30. The Federal
Land Banks, which recently had received more liberal loan-to-value
lending authority and which continued to offer relatively attractive

II -24
variable rates (based on the average cost of funds covering all out-
standing loans and now ranging from 7.5 to 8 per cent), increased
their outstandings by 20 per cent ($1.7 billion). Bank farm mortgage
loans outstanding were up about 12 per cent, while life insurance
company outstandings probably rose by only 2 per cent.
Farm lending operations of insurance companies reportedly
are now being generally curtailed as a result of reduced fund availability
and, in some states, restrictive usury ceilings. Because the Federal
Land Banks (which are exempt from usury laws) constitute a satisfactory
alternative source of funds for most purchasers of farm land, the
main impact of reduced insurance company lending is likely to be on
loan availability for special situations such as large ranches,
timber lands, or tracts with high development potential for nonfarm
purposes. Also, those rural bankers who have farm mortgage loan
referral or origination arrangements with life insurance companies
may temporarily lose this aspect of their ability to provide full
credit services to their farm borrowers.
As in the past periods of high interest rates on farm real
estate loans, financing by sellers of farms (who accounted for 43 per
cent of total credit extended in connection with farm land transfers
in 1972) will likely increase in relative importance. In such past
periods, interest rates on most seller financing are commonly believed
to have remained well below prevailing farm mortgage rates offered by

II -25
institutional lenders. For tax purposes, sellers apparently prefer to
realize a capital gain rather than current income, or perhaps they are
not fully aware of the current discounted value of the below-market
terms that they offer.
Federal finance. Current staff estimates of total Federal
receipts and expenditures on a unified budget basis have not been
changed since the last Greenbook. Budget receipts are projected at
$270.9 billion and expenditures at $269.7 billion. Nevertheless, new
uncertainties have developed in the outlays projection and compositional
changes have been made on the receipts side.
Federal outlays for defense in the current quarter have been
running about $2 billion lower (at an annual rate) than had been
anticipated. On the other hand, recent legislative initiatives in
several areas suggest that increases in non-defense outlays may be
somewhat larger for the full fiscal year. In addition, some uncontrollable
expenditures--interest on the public debt in particular--are running
high. Our estimates now incorporate the Federal pay raise in December,
rather than in January as previously assumed, but the additional cost
of this change is offset by the smaller size of the proposed raise,
4.8 per cent instead of the 5.5 per cent assumed earlier. On the
receipts side, recent increases in the staff's GNP forecast have
not produced a rise in projected total budget receipts because of an
offsetting decline in our estimate of the effective social insurance
tax rate.

II -26
The Treasury has been drawing down its cash balance. While
early September is a time of seasonal decline, the dip has been
larger than expected, resulting in direct borrowing at the Federal
Reserve. The end-of-August cash balance stood at $3.1 billion, down
$1.5 billion from that projected in the last Greenbook. Preliminary
August receipts were somewhat smaller than had been projected and total
outlays were somewhat larger. Because the September seasonal pattern
in receipts calls for a large influx after mid-month, the end-of-
September cash balance is projected to rise to $9.4 billion.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. The dollar has been relatively stable
in foreign exchange markets since mid-August. Preliminary weekly data
suggest that there was a balance of payments surplus on the official
settlements basis in August, following a small deficit in July.
More complete but still preliminary data for the second
quarter show that the basic deficit (on current and long-term capital
transactions) was at an annual rate of a little over $3 billion, rather
than the $2 billion earlier estimated. On the other hand, the first
quarter rate of basic deficit has been revised downward from $5 billion
to $4 billion. In both 1971 and 1972 the basic deficit had been nearly
$10 billion.
The outlook for the U.S. balance of payments continues to
be bright. The trade balance in July was in surplus for the second
time in four months. While there will probably continue to be month-
to-month swings between deficits and surpluses during the remainder of
1973, trade surpluses should occur more consistently in 1974 and be
of growing magnitude. The value of agricultural exports is expected
to remain high throughout the current fiscal year as export unit values
continue to rise for a time and export volumes are well sustained. The
backlog of foreign orders for U.S. durable goods, particularly machinery,
has steadily increased, indicating further expansion in exports of such
goods. Exports of industrial materials continue buoyant. While the

III -2
rate of economic advance in industrial countries abroad seems to be
slowing somewhat, foreign demand for U.S. exports is likely to remain
very strong for at least several more quarters.
Although the value of U.S. imports is likely to be sustained
by rising prices, the volume of imports is expected to continue to
decline as the pace of domestic economic expansion slows and as high
import prices increasingly discourage purchases of imported goods.
The volume and price of oil imports, however, should continue to rise
strongly, and there may be an increase in imports of automobiles since
stocks of imported cars have apparently been drawn down sharply during
the past six months.
Another major element of the basic balance that is showing
renewed strength is net foreign purchases of U.S. stocks. These
totaled over $300 million in July and apparently continued large in
August.
The continued rise in U.S. short-term interest rates has
been roughly paralleled by further interest rate advances abroad, so
that international rate differentials have not changed much.

III -3
Foreign exchange markets. In the last four weeks foreign
exchange markets have been generally calm and exchange rate fluctuations
modest compared to the wide, volatile and periodically disorderly swings
in rates of the past few months. Since mid-August the dollar has firmed
by less than one per cent against the major foreign currencies taken as
a group and was kept from appreciating further by major foreign central
bank intervention sales totaling nearly $1 billion.
On the European continent, developments in Germany, particularly
in the German money market, continued to dominate movements of continental
European currencies. The mark rate edged higher in late August as German
commercial banks positioned themselves for end-of-month reserve require-
ments. Although German call money rates briefly jumped to 40 per cent, a
repetition of the extreme credit squeeze which sent the mark rate soaring
in late July was avoided, partially through the provision of Bundesbank
credit to the banks, and the mark and German call money rates eased in
early September. A further factor bolstering the demand for the dollar
relative to the mark on the exchanges was the continued firming of U.S.
interest rates, indicated by the 1/4 percentage point increase in the
U.S. prime rate to 9-3/4 per cent in late August. The normally favorable
effect of the August 24 announcement that the U.S. trade balance had
moved from a deficit in June to a $1.5 billion annual rate surplus in
July was offset by the nearly simultaneous announcement that the German
trade surplus in July had increased to a record high 2.9 billion marks.
The relative stability of the mark rate allowed the Bundesbank to quietly

III -4
sell approximately $250 million in the last two weeks of August. Other
continental European central banks continued to refrain from intervention
activity in dollars.
The European narrow band agreement experienced little pressure
during the past month. The mark and guilder alternated at the top of
the band against the French franc at the bottom. Intra-European inter-
vention was confined to modest purchases of French francs by the
Netherlands Bank on several days. The Dutch central bank also purchased
a total of nearly $50 million equivalent of Belgian francs during this
period to maintain the narrower Benelux band.
The pound has declined by 2-1/2 per cent since mid-August,
despite intervention support by the Bank of England of $150 million in
the spot market and $200 million on a swap basis. Continued concern
over the outlook for the U.K. balance of payments, reinforced by the
U.K. government's reiterated refusal to reduce domestic demand, has
contributed to sterling's recent decline.
The Canadian dollar also experienced steady selling pressure
over the past month as Canadian interest rates continue to lag behind
U.S. rates. The Bank of Canada has moderated the decline in the
Canadian dollar exchange rate over this period through net sales of
$75 million.
The Bank of Japan has continued to support the yen rate at
a level 16 per cent above its Smithsonian dollar parity through daily
intervention sales of dollars. These sales have totaled nearly $530

III -5
million since mid-August. The effect of these sales on Japanese
official foreign exchange reserves during this period was largely
offset by repayments nearly equal in magnitude by Japanese commercial
banks of maturing dollar deposits previously placed at the banks by
Japanese official institutions.
The gold price has fluctuated between $100 and $110 over the
past month after the speculative gyrations of recent months.
Euro-dollar market. Interest rates in the Euro-dollar market
have risen, on balance, over the past four weeks, but the rise has been
moderate in comparison with the surge of nearly 3 percentage points
between May and early August. In the week ending September 12 the
weekly averages of the overnight rate and the 1-month rate were each
about one-half percentage point higher than 4 weeks earlier. The weekly
average differentials show very little net change over this period. For
the week of September 12 reserve-free overnight Euro-dollars cost U.S.
banks 17 basis points less than Federal funds, while the 1-month Euro-
dollar rate continued to exceed the 30-59 day CD rate by more than a
percentage point.
The increase in U.S. banks' Euro-dollar borrowings came to an
end in mid-August and has since been reversed. Daily liabilities to
foreign branches reported by 49 U.S. banks -- which account for nearly
all such liabilities of U.S. banks -- had risen from a weekly average of
$2.1 billion (close to the 1973 low) in the week of June 13, to a high
for the year of $3.1 billion in the week of August 15, The reduction

III -6
in the marginal reserve requirement on Euro-dollar borrowings from 20 per
cent to 8 per cent in mid-May encouraged such borrowing. The high cost of
Federal funds compared with overnight Euro-dollars also encouraged banks
to borrow Euro-dollars. Subsequently, liabilities to branches fell to
an average of $2.2 billion in the week of September 5. The phasing-out
of the banks' reserve-free bases by 10 per cent (about $150 million) each
reserve computation period, beginning July 5, is subjecting an increasing
proportion of borrowings to the reserve requirement; this factor taken
alone reduces banks' incentive to maintain borrowings.
Weekly figures suggest that borrowings abroad by U.S. agencies
and branches of foreign banks have undergone very little net change since
early July, when reserve deposits against increases in borrowings from
foreign banks (above the average level in May) were called for under the
Chairman's letter of June 1.

U.S. balance of payments. The overall balance on the official
settlements basis in July was a deficit (not seasonally adjusted) of
about $200 million; weekly preliminary data for August indicate a
surplus of roughly $400 million in that month. In the second quarter
the official settlements balance was a surplus of about $1/2 billion
(seasonally adjusted). The surplus in the second quarter reflected net
short-term capital inflows (including errors and omissions) which more
than offset a deficit in the "basic" balance (current account transactions
and long-term capital flows).
Data for the "basic" balance in the second quarter are still
preliminary, but presently indicate a deficit of a little over $3 billion
at an annual rate in that period, moderately smaller than the downward
revised estimate of a $4 billion rate in the first quarter. In both
calendar 1971 and 1972 the basic deficit was nearly $10 billion.
The major elements in the improvement in the basic balance
in the second quarter were a further reduction in the trade deficit,
reduced net Government capital outflows, and a sharp drop in the out-
flow of U.S. direct investments abroad (from an exceptionally high
first quarter level), which more than offset a steep decline in foreign
purchases of U.S. securities.
The trade deficit in the second quarter is now estimated to
have been an annual rate of less than $1 billion (balance of payments
basis) compared with nearly $4 billion in the first quarter. In July

III -9
the trade balance shifted into a surplus of $1-1/2 billion at an annual
rate (see below). The estimate of the second-quarter surplus on income
and services has been revised downward to an annual rate of about
$3-1/4 billion (from $4 billion) as interest payments to foreigners were
higher than earlier estimated. A special advance deposit from Japan
for future deliveries of uranium and prepayments for military equipment
were instrumental in lowering net U.S. Government outflows in the
second quarter. Such net outflows are expected to increase in the
second half of the year in the absence of these special receipts.
While foreign purchases of U.S. stocks fell very sharply in
the second quarter, (in May there were net sales), foreign purchases
picked up strongly in July, totaling $315 million and additional large
purchases are reported by brokers in August. Apparently the average
value of stock purchases in July and August was only moderately below
the very high monthly average of purchases in the first quarter of
1973. Sales of offshore U.S. corporate bonds also increased in July
and August over the low levels of the immediately preceding months
but are still below the amounts sold monthly in the first part of this
year. International organizations -- the World Bank and the Inter-
national Development Agency -- shifted some of their short-term U.S.
assets into longer-term assets by purchasing about $150 million of U.S.
agency bonds in July. U.S. private purchases of foreign bonds remained
at a relatively low level in July and August and there was no significant
U.S. activity in foreign stocks in those months.

III -10
US. bank-reported claims on foreigners (both long- and short-
term) rose further in July but at a lower rate than in the second quarter.
The July increase was largely in claims of U.S. agencies and branches
of foreign banks. Preliminary weekly data indicate a decrease in bank
claims on foreigners in August.
U.S. banks' liquid liabilities to foreign commercial banks
(including foreign branches) which had increased by about $2 billion
in the second quarter, increased by about an additional $1 billion in
July and August (Wednesday data), mainly reflecting increased borrowing
from foreign branches. However, as noted above, liabilities to branches
declined very sharply in early September.
U.S. foreign trade. In July, the U.S. trade balance improved
substantially to a surplus of $1.5 billion at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate (balance of payments basis) from a $1.2 billion deficit in
June as exports rose sharply while imports fell.
For April-July the trade deficit was at a rate of $0.3 billion
compared to the first quarter deficit of $3.8 billion. On an area
basis, the April-July improvement over the first quarter largely
reflected a $1.6 billion reduction (annual rate, Census basis) in our
trade deficit with Japan. There has also been an increase in our trade
surplus with European Community countries other than Germany this year.
With Germany, however, our trade deficit has not changed, running at an
annual rate of over $1-1/2 billion in both the first quarter and in
April-July.

III -11
Price and volume patterns evident since this spring were
reinforced by the July trade figures. Strong export price rises have
kept the value of total exports moving up steadily (by 10 percent from
the first quarter to April-July) but the volume of total exports has
increased by 4-1/2 percent with declines in the volume of agricultural
exports offset by continued growth in the volume of nonagricultural
exports. The value of imports rose from the first quarter to April-
July only because of higher prices. The volume of imports has declined
in almost every month since March. The expansion in nonagricultural
exports and the decline in the volume of imports give evidence of
continuing improvement in the U.S. trade position.
Despite sharp price increases the value of agricultural exports
dropped slightly in July from the exceedingly high June level. The
decline in shipments was broadly based; wheat, corn, soybeans and
animal feeds all dropped sharply. Part of the decline in soybean shipments
may reflect limitations on exports which became effective in July.
For April-July, the value of agricultural shipments increased
10 percent from the first quarter with average prices up about 15 percent
and volume down 5 percent. Because of expected further increases in
the prices of agricultural exports and a continuing large volume of
shipments, the value of agricultural exports is expected to continue at
or above current high rates well into next year.

III -12
There have also been significant increases in U.S. exports of
nonagricultural commodities. In July, nonagricultural exports continued
the strong rise of recent months. The increase in value from the first
quarter to April-July was 11 percent, with prices up 4 percent and the
volume up 7-1/2 percent. Because of strong economic activity abroad and
the continuing favorable effects for U.S. exports of the exchange rate
realignments, there have been rises, some very sharp, in the volume of
virtually all nonagricultural commodity categories. As a result,
nonagricultural exports have taken an increasing portion of U.S. non-
agricultural goods output. According to preliminary estimates, non-
agricultural goods output (in real terms, valued at 1967 prices)
increased by about $22 billion at an annual rate from the last half
of 1972 to the first half of 1973. The volume of nonagricultural exports
increased at a $4 billion rate over that period, nearly a fifth of the
total increase. From 1971 to 1972, exports accounted for only 10 percent
of the growth in total nonagricultural goods output. The outlook for
continued increases in export shipments appears to be good; foreign
orders for durable goods were high again in July and the backlog of
unfilled orders has increased steadily each month since January.
Exports of industrial supplies have been particularly buoyant
because of supply shortages accompaying the strong rise in output
abroad which have contributed to a cumulative buildup of demand. This
year the quantities exported of aluminum, steel scrap, steel mill

III -13
products, chemicals, lumber, and plastic materials have all increased,
by 20 to 90 percent, above shipments in the same period a year ago.
Also, export shipments of some of these products (for example, steel
scrap and aluminum) have taken an increasing percentage of available
U.S. supply; the growth in this supply has also been limited by lower
imports of some of these products. Increased disposals from government
stockpiles have helped alleviate tightness in the supplies of some products.
For example, from January through June 300 thousand tons of aluminum
were released from stockpile (an amount equivalent to 13 percent of first-
half U.S. primary aluminum production) compared to 6 thousand tons for
all of last year and none in 1971. By the end of August, this disposable
stockpile was further reduced by 245 thousand tons; leaving an additional
500 thousand tons available for disposal.
Imports in July, were characterized by declines in foods
(notably coffee and fish), in automotive products from Europe and
Japan, in other consumer goods, and by an unusual but presumably
temporary dip in fuel imports. Between the first quarter and April-
July there were volume declines in all commodity categories except
fuels and capital goods. The increasing cost of imported goods has
had considerable damping effect on the amount of imports being purchased.
The number of foreign cars imported from Europe and Japan declined
between the first quarter and April-July, while their average price

III -14
increased by nearly 20 percent. However, the number of foreign car
sales continued to exceed the number of cars imported, as it has
every quarter for the past year, suggesting that inventories continued
to be drawn down. Possibly this reduction in inventories will lead
to an increased number of auto imports in the coming months.

III -15
Economic activity in major industrial countries. As in the
United States, the exceptionally high rates of growth in aggregate out-
put have begun to slow in most other major industrial countries. This
is indicated by recent data on industrial production -- summarized in
Table 1 -- which show that output, except in Italy, advanced much more
slowly in recent months than it did either earlier in the year or from
mid-1972, when a widespread acceleration in the rate of economic expansion
began.
A major factor in the upswing was the effort to build up stocks
of intermediate goods from their low post-recession levels, partly to
restore stock-sales ratios, and partly in anticipation of rising costs
and prices; inflationary expectations also played a role in the strong
advance of consumer expenditures. In addition, revived private demand
for fixed capital investment broadened out the general advance in early
1973. Meanwhile, rapid expansion of international trade served to
spread the impact of these and other demand forces very widely.
In almost all countries -- including several, such as the
United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Canada, where relatively
high unemployment persists -- capacity utilization rates have risen to
the point where growth is now being inhibited (though to some extent
the statistical evidence of slackening in recent output growth, mainly
because of seasonal adjustment difficulties, overstates the underlying
developments thus far). Furthermore, in order to counter very high

III -16
and rising rates of inflation, several countries -- notably Germany, Japan,
France and Belgium -- have taken measures, of varying intensity, to slow
expansion through damping aggregate demand. However, at least to date,
emerging capacity restraints have been a more important factor than
efforts to ease demand pressures in slowing growth.
The current deceleration in growth was virtually inevitable
in view of the very rapid pace of expansion in preceding months and
reflects a return to more moderate rates of advance, roughly equal, in
general, to the long-term trend. The one exception may be developments
in consumer expenditures in some countries -- particularly the
United Kingdom--- where the high rates of inflation have cut into pur-
chasing power and real spending increases may be moderating significantly.
Inflation rates have remained high everywhere. As indicated
in Table 2, with the sole exception of the United States, the rise in
consumer prices from mid-1972 to mid-1973 exceeded 6-1/2 per cent. And
in every case the rate of increase in this period was at least slightly
higher than from end-1971 to end-1972. The continued rapid rise in
prices can be attributed in large measure to supply problems in the
food sector, to a flattening out of the high rates of productivity
increase associated with the early part of the upswing and to the
wearing off of the moderating effects of exchange rate revaluations.

Official statistics indicate that real economic growth in
Germany, which was very rapid from mid-1972 through the first quarter
of this year, may have slowed, or ceased entirely, in the second quarter.
However, the evidence at this time is unusually difficult to interpret.
Shifts in vacation periods and the very mild winter put seasonal adjust-
ment factors in question. Thus it was possible for one of the most
respected economic research institutes in Germany, the DIW, using its
own seasonal adjustment factor, to compute GNP figures markedly different
from the official ones.
The DIW's GNP estimates trace a smoother growth path than do
the official figures, yielding relatively low growth in the first
quarter, relatively high growth in the second. For the year starting
with the second half of 1972, the DIW estimates a 6-1/2 per cent annual
rate of growth in real GNP. In contrast, the Bundesbank estimates an
annual rate of growth in GNP from June 1972 through March 1973 of about
11 per cent, implying a significant slowdown in the second quarter of
this year.
Despite the difficulty of interpreting the meaning of the real
output statistics for recent months, there appears to be general agreement
that growth in the second half of 1973 will be slower than in late 1972
and early 1973 and that the slowdown will intensify next year, as policy
measures aimed at containing aggregate demand work through the system.

III -20
The Bundesbank has steadily tightened monetary policy for almost
a year, and fiscal measures -- which are expected to grip in coming months --
were taken in May, to supplement a relatively restrictive budget. Thus
slackening in the pace of economic expansion is expected to derive
primarily from a deceleration in the growth of demand, particularly
since existing capacity would allow further expansion, even though some
bottlenecks, as well as a natural reaction to previous very high rates
of expansion, can also be expected to contribute to the slowdown. At
mid-year, the unemployment rate was well above the low, and the capacity
utilization rate in industry well below the high, reached in the previous
boom.
Data on new industrial orders also suggest an easing of demand
pressures. Such orders, after a prolonged rapid rise, declined slightly
from the first to the second quarter, as a continued, if somewhat more
moderate, increase in export orders was more than offset by a decrease
in domestic orders.
Although aggregate demand is apparently responding to the
restraint measures taken so far, price indicators are reacting more
slowly, if at all. There has been some deceleration in the advance of
producers prices for industrial goods in recent months, and the consumer
price index did not rise from June to July. However, the stability of
the index in July was due entirely to a fall in food prices, with the

III -21
advance in non-food prices continuing to accelerate. Seasonally adjusted,
the latter rose at annual rate of about 8 per cent from February-April
to May-July, compared to a rise of about 7 per cent, annual rate, from
November-January to February-April. Little, if any, slowing in consumer
prices is expected before next year.
The government's campaign to reduce the rate of inflation has
recently been threatened by a wave of wildcat strikes, mostly in the
metal and metal working industries. The principal objective of these
strikes is to obtain compensation for the unexpectedly rapid increase in
the cost of living. The walkouts are being conducted mostly by workers
who received a relatively moderate 8-1/2 per cent annual wage hike early
in the year. Wage agreements reached later in 1973 -- when it had become
apparent that price inflation was much more intense than had originally
been foreseen -- generally provided for significantly higher increases.
But the government fears that success by the strikers could markedly
boost the rate of wage inflation.
There are clear signs that Japan's economic upswing, dating from
early 1972, has slowed down. Industrial production, for instance, after
rising at an accelerating oace from mid-1972 through the first quarter,
increased at a high but substantially reduced rate in the next four
months. The fourth-to-first quarter and first-to-second quarter annual
rates of increase were 29 and 16 per cent, respectively.

III -22
The rate of expansion in real GNP peaked at the end of last year,
when the increase from the third to the fourth quarter reached an annual
rate of 17 per cent. The first quarter rise -- at 15 per cent -- was
slightly lower, and in the second quarter there was a rather sharp decelera-
tion, GNP rising at an annual rate of about 6 per cent. The main
stimulative forces have been investment in fixed capital, by both the
private and public sectors, and efforts to build up inventories. Large
balance-of-payments surpluses on current account contributed heavily to
expansion last year, but the surpluses have declined this year.
To a limited degree, the slower pace of economic activity in
recent months may reflect the effects of stabilization measures adopted
by the authorities to combat inflation. Price indicators show that the
rate of inflation has in fact slowed somewhat of late, though both whole-
sale and consumer prices are still rising at very rapid rates. Restrictive
actions taken by the monetary authorities this year include four increases
in both the Bank of Japan's discount rate and reserve requirements and
imposition of increasingly restrictive limits on the rate of loan expansion
by the large city banks. The last increase in the discount rate, on
August 29, was by a full percentage point -- the largest single change
since 1956. Since nid-year the government has tightened fiscal policy,
primarily acting to restrain the volume of public works expenditures.
However, neither these measures, nor, to date, the revaluation,
have substantially reduced aggregate demand pressures. New orders for

III -23
machinery, for example, have continued at a very high level since the
final months of 1972. It would seem, then, that the slower rate of
economic growth in Japan is primarily a function of a steadily decreasing
margin of spare capacity, plus special factors causing supply shortages.
The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing this year has been approach-
ing the very high level reached in the previous boom.
Because of the combination of a restrictive policy stance and
dwindling spare capacity, growth is not expected to return to the high
rates that prevailed from early 1972 through early 1973. The rise in GNP
from 1972 to 1973 is expected to be about 11 per cent.
There is mounting evidence that the growth of economic activity
in the United Kingdom, which has been rapid by previous standards, has
begun to decelerate. Real GNP grew at an estimated annual rate of about
4 per cent from the second half of 1972 to the first half of 1973. The
annual rate of increase from the first to the second half last year was
about 6 per cent.
The principal element in the slowdown in GNP growth has been a
decline in the rate of increase in real private consumption expenditures,
which account for almost three-quarters of British GNP. Growth in con-
sumer outlays from the second half last year to the first half this year
was at an annual rate of 4 per cent, half the rate of increase between
the first two halves of 1972. In the second quarter of 1973 consumer
outlays actually fell, reflecting primarily the bulge in consumer buying

III -24
early in the year in anticipation of the value-added tax which took effect
April 1. A decline had been expected, but the size of the drop -- 3 per
cent -- came as a surprise.
In contrast to private consumption, capital expenditures and
exports grew rapidly in the first half. Total investment rose at an annual
rate of about 7 per cent from the second to the first half, reflecting
a sharp acceleration from the very slow rate of growth during 1972.
Investment expenditures by manufacturing industries grew especially fast
in the first half -- at an annual rate of about 14 per cent. The annual
rate of increase in the volume of exports between the last six months of
1972 and the first six of 1973 was about 25 per cent.
The strength of exports and investment combined with a slowdown
in consumer expenditures sufficient to slow the rate of increase in GNP
as a whole is precisely what the government had hoped for. However,
there are reports that the economy -- despite slower growth and an
unemployment rate of 2.5 per cent (high in comparison to the 1960's) --
is fast approaching an excessively high level of capacity utilization.
Furthermore, the government's success in slowing the rise in
real consumer expenditures has been achieved only at the high cost of
holding down the growth of real income through rapid inflation. Wage
earnings have increased only slightly faster than prices since Phase I
of the government's price/wage policy was introduced last November,

III -25
and real disposable income appears to have risen little, if at all, since
the end of the year.
Official policy this year has been expansionary in the sense
that the very large borrowing requirement in the March budget has been
allowed to produce a very sizable increase in the money supply.
Aggregate output in France, as elsewhere, rose very rapidly in
late 1972 and the first quarter of 1973. There were widespread strikes
in the spring, but there are no clear indications that the general trend
of real GNP is slowing appreciably from the 5 to 6 per cent rate main-
tained on the average since 1971.
Growth is expected to slow moderately next year, however, both
because of capacity limitations and governmental moves to reduce infla-
tion. The relatively high rate of unemployment -- reflecting substantial
increases in productivity and a rapid rise in the working age population --
obscures growing shortages of skilled labor. In addition, about 40 per
cent of French industrial firms report an absence of spare capacity.
Inflation, which had been somewhat mitigated early in the year
by reductions in the value-added tax, has resumed its upward trend. The
authorities have sought to counter inflation primarily by steadily
tightening monetary policy. Monetary measures since April have included
two increases in the Bank of France's discount rate, a reduction in the
permissible growth of bank loans to the private sector, additional reserve

III -26
requirements, and personal loan ceilings. In addition, to supplement
monetary actions in battling price rises, a system of price controls for
most industrial goods has been introduced.
In contrast to most other OECD countries, Italy is neither
experiencing a slowdown in economic growth nor expecting one to occur
later this year or in 1974. The explanation is that the economic
recovery in Italy, dating from late 1972, began from such a low level
of economic activity that unutilized resources are still in abundant
supply. Consequently, the Italian economy is not faced with the capacity
limitations now slowing growth elsewhere and, because of the large amount
of slack, economic policy remains, on balance, expansionary, despite
the severity of inflation in Italy.
The recovery, which was aided by stimulative monetary and fiscal
policies, was interrupted in the first quarter by strikes. However, the
economy rebounded in the second quarter, industrial production rising to
a level over 10 per cent higher than in the second quarter in 1972.
Real GNP, most forecasters agree, will be about 4-1/2 per cent
higher this year than last, and the increase would have been higher still
but for the first quarter work stoppages. The increase from 1971 to 1972
had been only 3.2 per cent. Looking ahead, the OECD predicts a rise in
real GNP from the second half of 1973 to the first half of 1974 of over
5 per cent, annual rate.

III -27
Rises in real consumption expenditures are contributing heavily
to the recovery. Consumption has been stimulated by the large wage
increases in the 3-year wage contracts concluded in late 1972 and early
1973. Fixed investment, which was virtually unchanged from 1971 to
1972, is again rising. Exports are an expansionary force, too, though
the rise may be lower in 1973 than in 1972 because of the adverse effect
on exports of the strikes at the beginning of the year. Rising lira
prices may also inhibit foreign demand for Italian goods.
Fiscal policy remains stimulative, with the central government
budget deficit expected to increase again this year. Monetary policy has
been moderately tightened recently -- credit ceilings were placed on bank
loans to certain borrowers at the end of July -- but probably not enough
to slow the pace of recovery.
In line with developments elsewhere, economic growth in Belgium
is expected to moderate from its current very rapid rate to more normal
levels in response to relatively tight capacity conditions and efforts to
slow a rate of inflation high by Belgian standards. In the Netherlands,
too, growth is likely to slow somewhat from its present rather brisk pace.
Unemployment is very high there but, because of the persistence of severe
inflation, the government is reluctant to institute strong expansionary
measures. Growth is further inhibited by tight capacity conditions in
industry, perhaps reflecting the relatively low level of business capital
investment in 1971 and 1972.

III -28
Sweden may prove an exception to the prevailing pattern of
decelerating growth. High unemployment, a large margin of spare plant
capacity, and the continuing expansionary thrust of policy in spite of
rapid inflation make it possible that GNP growth next year will be no
lower than the anticipated 5 per cent rise in 1973. However, growth in
Sweden, as in all the smaller countries of Europe, will be adversely
affected by slowdowns in the major European countries and in the
United States.
Growth of Canadian GNP, which slowed markedly in the second
quarter and which has been curtailed by strikes in the current quarter,
will probably rebound at the end of the year, barring further strikes.
However, high rates of capacity utilization and slower expansion in the
United States will prevent a resumption of the very rapid advance in
late 1972 and early 1973, when real GNP was increasing at an annual rate
of 11 per cent. Nevertheless, GNP next year may still advance relatively
rapidly, at about 6 per cent, since business investment is expected to
show strength and since the government is still intent on lowering
unemployment. As in France, the high jobless rate is in large measure
a reflection of the fast rate of increase in the working age population.
Prices in Canada continue to rise at a very fast pace, but the govern-
ment has avoided measures that would restrict aggregate demand in its
recent efforts to counter inflation.
