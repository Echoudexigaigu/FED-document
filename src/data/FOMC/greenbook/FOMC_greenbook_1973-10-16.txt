Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Staff estimates indicate that in the third quarter nominal
GNP increased about $32 billion, prices rose sharply further, and real
GNP expanded at an annual rate of about 3-3/4 per cent--somewhat less
than was projected four weeks ago.
Judging from recent retail sales data, consumer spending for
goods in the third quarter was not as strong as projected earlier. For
the quarter as a whole, retail sales are now estimated to be less than
2-1/2 per cent above the second quarter with virtually all of the increase
accounted for by higher prices. September retail sales, estimated on
the basis of weekly data, declined slightly from a downward revised
August level, even though unit sales of autos were quite strong.
Business activity has continued generally strong, however.
Industrial production is tentatively estimated to have increased about
three-fourths of one per cent in September and to have expanded at a
4 per cent annual rate over the past 3 months. Output of business
equipment was up sharply further in September. Business inventory
investment has continued quite moderate, however, with stock/sales
ratios at unusually low levels.
Nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably further in
September. But the rate of increase from June to September was well
below the exceptionally rapid rise of the preceding nine months,
mainly because manufacturing employment little changed over this
interval. The unemployment rate remained at 4.8 per cent.

I -2
In recent months, the rise in the private nonfarm hourly index
has been faster than earlier this year and in September the rate of in-
crease accelerated. In the six month period from March to September
the index rose 7.3 per cent.
Wholesale prices of farm products and foods declined substan-
tially from their August peak to September, following the extraordinary
increase of the preceding month, but were still almost 40 per cent
above September 1972. Some further declines in livestock prices have
been reported since mid-September. Wholesale prices of industrial
commodities rose 0.7 per cent further in September and were about 8 per
cent higher than a year earlier. In August, the consumer price index
had jumped sharply--mainly, but not solely, because of foods--to a
level 7.5 per cent above August 1972.
Outlook. Staff GNP projections now assume growth in M1 at
an annual rate somewhat below 5 per cent through the first quarter of
1974 and at a rate somewhat above 5 per cent thereafter. Under this
assumption, around year-end, market interest rates may have moved some-
what above recent reduced levels. Federal expenditure estimates have
been raised somewhat for calendar 1974, mainly because we now assume the
5.9 per cent increase in social security benefits will become effective
at the beginning of the year rather than at midyear. No allowance has
been made for any potential disruption arising out of the current
mid-East hostilities.
The annual rate of real GNP growth in this quarter and the
first half of 1974 has been raised by an average of close to one-half
percentage point. In the current quarter, consumer spending is

I -3
expected to be a little stronger than projected earlier in part because
of the October date for the Federal pay increase. Inventory investment
is still expected to accelerate appreciably after a rather sluggish
third quarter.
The private fixed weight price index is now projected to
increase at an annual rate of 6.3 per cent in the fourth quarter rather
than the 7.0 per cent projected earlier. The downscaling is primarily
attributable to the smaller increase now anticipated for foods and the
postponement by the Cost of Living Council of any further increases in
auto prices probably until next year. A price surge in line with cost
increases, however, is still expected for other commodities.
Although we still expect the economy to slow further next year,
the faster growth in real GNP now projected for early next year is due
to the somewhat greater strength now seen in business fixed investment.
Capacity limitations and mounting needs for pollution control will likely
result in more spending than earlier foreseen. With two recent private
surveys indicating substantial further increases in capital outlays
next year, business fixed investment is now projected to increase about
11 per cent, compared to 10 per cent in the September Greenhook. In
addition we have raised slightly the projection for housing starts
beginning with the second quarter of next year in view of the support
to housing markets suggested by the President's recent housing message.
However, housing starts are still expected to decline substantially
primarily because of the current tightness in mortgage markets. Net
exports are still shown to rise appreciably further.

I -4
The projection for the second half of 1974 is essentially
the same as four weeks ago, with real GNP rising at an annual rate
of only 1.0 per cent. From late 1973 to late 1974, real GNP is projected
to increase 1.7 per cent, a little more than projected 4 weeks ago
because of the stronger first half now expected. The unemployment rate
is still expected to move up from 4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of
this year to 5.5 per cent late next year.
The price projections for 1974 are little changed from those
presented a month ago, but with a faster rise in the first half than
in the second. Unit labor costs are expected to increase substantially
throughout the year, while the rise in food prices still seems likely
to moderate.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have advanced about three-fourths of one per cent in
September. The increase in output results primarily from a significant
recovery in autos from the reduced August rate and a further large
increase in business equipment. Production worker manhour data indicate
relatively small gains in output in a number of other industries. If
the rise in September is realized, the total index would be about
8.5 per cent above a year earlier.
Auto assemblies rose 13 per cent to an annual rate of 9.0
million units (preliminary) from the low August rate. Production
schedules for October and the fourth quarter are set at a 10.0 million
unit rate. Output of most other durable consumer goods--furniture,
appliances, TV sets--is expected to have continued at record levels,
and production of consumer staples apparently increased further. Among
materials, output of raw steel increased and production of chemicals is
estimated to be up somewhat further, and output of paper and products,
crude oil, and petroleum products was maintained at record levels.
Retail sales. Total retail sales in September are estimated
on the basis of weekly data, to have declined three-fourths of 1 per cent
despite a strong rise in unit auto sales. On the basis of more complete
sample counts, sales in August were revised down sharply to show a
decline of 1.3 per cent. The increase in retail sales in July is esti-
mated slightly higher at 3.9 per cent. For the third quarter as a
whole sales are tentatively estimated to be 2.3 per cent above the
second quarter.

I -11
Unit sales of consumer durables. Domestic-type auto sales
showed a substantial rise in September, as sales of foreign cars slowed
somewhat while the introduction of 1974 domestic models were well
received. Sales of new domestic-type autos were at a 10.6 million
unit annual rate, 9 per cent above August and 4 per cent above a year
earlier. In the first nine months of 1973, sales have been at an
average rate of 10.1 million units. Auto stocks were equivalent to a
42 day supply at the end of September, down 16 per cent from August
with the Chrysler strike and parts shortages, as well as continued
strong consumer demand contributing factors.
Sales of foreign cars were at a 1.5 million unit rate in
September, 2 per cent below August and 7 per cent below a year earlier.
Import sales have declined steadily since their peak in February. The
import share of the market on a seasonally adjusted basis was down to
12.7 per cent in September from 14.0 per cent in September 1972.
September factory sales of major appliances, TVs, and radios
are estimated to have risen 5 per cent from August. The increase is
attributable to a large advance in color TVs and radios. Appliance
sales, however, were down 3 per cent.

Consumer attitudes and buying plans. The latest Michigan
Survey Research Center and Conference Board surveys indicate further
erosion of consumer confidence but this was coupled with fairly strong
purchase plans for durable goods. Usually, attitudes about personal
finances and the business outlook are broadly consistent with plans to
make discretionary purchases.
The index of consumer sentiment, computed by Michigan for
almost 25 years from responses to five questions, declined to a histori-
cal low in the August-September survey. Much of the deterioration since
May has been attributable to pessimistic answers to two questions on
present and expected personal financial situations. But responses to
two questions about business conditions--already gloomy in May--became
even worse. Evaluations of whether it is a "good time to buy" household.

I -13
durables were also somewhat less favorable, but responses to this
question were still optimistic enough to suggest that inflationary
hedge buying may continue.
The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence was lower
in July-August than in May-June, but still above the 1970 recession
levels. This new index, which is a composite of attitudinal questions
on economic conditions constructed from surveys beginning in January
1967, peaked in November-December and has subsequently tended downward.
In the latest survey, more families than in the previous bi-monthly
survey expected business conditions to worsen and jobs to be harder to
find in the next six months. Attitudes toward future income gains
were unchanged from May-June.
The Conference Board's new index of buying plans--a composite
of intentions to purchase cars, homes, and appliances--was essentially
unchanged in the most recent survey. Small declines in plans to purchase
automobiles and major appliances were slightly more than offset by an
increase in plans to buy houses. In contrast, the outlook for demand
for houses worsened in the Michigan survey with only 24 per cent of
respondents saying it was a good time to buy. This is a dramatic shift
from a year earlier when the comparable figure was 51 per cent.

I -13a
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction--revised downward somewhat for August--declined further
in September to an annual rate approaching $137 billion. Outlays for
private nonresidential construction, at a new high in August, apparently
changed little in September. However, outlays for residential and
public construction continued to drop.
Reflecting partly an upward revision in construction cost
estimates for single-family homes, the Census Bureau's composite con-
struction cost index is now reported to have been running in recent
months nearly 10 per cent above a year earlier--about one percentage
point more than had been indicated earlier. This compares with an
average year-to-year rise of 7 per cent in each of the previous two
years. Since the first quarter of this year, higher costs have ac-
counted for all of the over-all rise in construction outlays in current
dollars.
Seasonally adjusted private housing starts, which had risen
in July, resumed their decline in August to an annual rate of 2.05
million units. With residential mortgage commitments continuing down-
ward and with building permits in August quite low, private housing
starts in September probably fell below the 2 million unit mark for the
first time in 2-1/2 years. This possibility suggests an average starts
rate for the third quarter as much as 15 per cent below the first quarter
peak, although still high by pre-1971 standards. Mobile home shipments
are also indicated to have declined appreciably from their first quarter
peak. Meanwhile, although limited in some areas by difficulties in
securing needed materials and supplies, completions of conventional housing
units have tended irregularly higher this year.

Anticipated plant and equipment spending. The latest
(confidential) results of two private surveys indicate that in 1974
businesses plan to spend 12 to 15 per cent more than in 1973.
Lionel D. Edie and Co. is predicting that businesses plan a 12 per
cent gain in 1974, while Rinfret-Boston Associates is estimating
(based on a response of 67 per cent of its sample) a 15 per cent
increase. Both surveys expect manufacturers to increase investment
in 1974 at least as much as in 1973.

The track record of the Rinfret-Boston survey has not been
as accurate as the Edie survey. Since the inception of his independent
survey in 1968, Rinfret has over-predicted growth of investment

(through 1972) by an average of 2.6 percentage points per year. For
the same time span the Edie survey has over-predicted percentage
changes in capital spending by an average of 1.4 per cent per year.
Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods were off nearly 1 per cent in August (p) following a slight
decline in July. Defense capital goods orders rose almost 60 per
cent, recovering most of the July drop which had reflected turn-of-
fiscal-year volatility. Excluding defense, the decline in orders came
to 2.6 per cent after an increase of 1.6 per cent in July. Nondefense
capital goods orders were off 4.0 per cent, compared with little change
in June.
Shipments of durable goods fell (3.7 per cent) in August,
partly as the result of curtailed auto production. Backlogs of
unfilled durable goods orders rose 3.1 per cent, with similarly large
increases in nearly all industry and product groupings.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturers' inventories rose at
an annual rate of $11.6 billion in August, slightly more than the revised
July rate of $10.6 billion and showing little change from the second
quarter average. By stage of fabrication, materials'stocks rose at a
$6.2 billion annual rate--down somewhat from July but above the relatively
high rates in the first two quarters. Work in process inventories rose at
a $7.3 billion rate, the most rapid gain this year. But finished goods
stocks declined. Wholesale trade inventories rose at a $4.3 billion annual
rate in August--off from the upward revised $6.1 billion July rate.

Of the eight leading series available, the only series increasing
in August were price related--the ratio of price to unit labor cost
in manufacturing and industrial materials prices. Series declining
included both current dollar and physical quantity series: down were
initial claims for unemployment insurance (inverted), the manufacturing
workweek, common stock prices, new orders for durable goods, contracts
and orders for plant and equipment, and housing permits.
In September, stock prices rose as did the manufacturing
workweek.

I -21
Labor market. Demand for labor continues relatively strong,
although the pace of employment expansion has slowed somewhat in recent
months. Reflecting gains in service-type industries, nonfarm payroll
rose by nearly 200,000 in September--the same as the (downward revised)
August increase. Growth of payroll employment has slowed in the past
few months from the previous exceptionally rapid pace. Most of the
recent additions have been in services and trade, as growth in manu-
facturing employment has been at a near standstill since June. Both
total employment and the labor force increased substantially in
September following little change during the two prior months and the
unemployment rate remained at 4.8 per cent. Over the past year the
civilian labor force has shown an exceptionally large increase of
2.3 million.

showed little change over the month except the volatile Negro rate which
rebounded 0.7 percentage points to 9.4 per cent, the same rate as in July,
Over the past year the number of unemployed workers has declined by half
a million, and the average duration of unemployment has shortened by
nearly three weeks.

Earnings and collective bargaining. The index of average
hourly earnings for the private nonfarm economy rose at an 8-1/2 per
cent annual rate in September, reflecting large increases in
manufacturing and service industries. Over the past three months
the nonfarm earnings index rose at a 7 per cent annual rate,
compared to a 6.3 per cent rate in the preceding nine months.
The recent speed-up has occurred in the more heavily unionized

industrial sectors, reflecting a number of automatic cost-of-living
increases and the introduction of some new contracts.

Following a one-week strike, the UAW and Chrysler agreed to
a new collective bargaining agreement. The contract, which covers
117,000 production workers, is expected to serve as a general pattern
for over half a million workers at Ford and GM. Overall, Chrysler
estimates that the new agreement will increase labor costs (including
fringes) by about 7 per cent a year during the three year contract
period. But the company's assumption as to the extent of the cost-
of-living increases during the three year period is not known. The
settlement calls for first-year wage increases averaging more than
25 cents an hour, which includes an allowance for cost-of-living
increases since June. Increases in the second and third years will
average 3 per cent (over 15 cents an hour)--equivalent to the "annual
improvement factor" under previous contracts--plus a sweetened cost-of-
living adjustment. The contract contains substantial gains in fringe
benefits, especially in pension payments--allowing workers to retire
after thirty years of service regardless of age--and the introduction
of voluntary over-time provisions.

Consumer prices, Consumer prices jumped 1.9 per cent
in August, seasonally adjusted, as foods posted a record 6 per cent
increase following the relaxation of controls. Prices of other
commodities were up 0.5 per cent, although ceilings were not re-
moved for these until August 12, and the rate of rise in service
costs accelerated markedly to 0.7 per cent, the largest rise in
nearly 3 years.

The leap in food costs reflected extraordinary increases
for pork, and poultry and eggs--which had been allowed to rise at
retail to reflect a dollar-for-dollar pass-through of farm prices--
but beef prices also rose substantially despite ceilings and all
major food components posted (seasonally adjusted) advances. In
September, the retail cost of the USDA's market basket of U. S.
farm food dropped about 2 per cent, seasonally adjusted, according
to preliminary (confidential) estimates. Declines were sharpest for
poultry, eggs and fresh fruits and vegetables. Pork was down
about 5 per cent, but cereal and bakery, oilseed and dairy products
were up,
The August increase for other commodities includes a
contra-seasonal advance for apparel and a large increase for houses,
and a drop in 1973-model car prices which was less than seasonal.
A sharp increase in mortgage interest rates was mainly
responsible for the acceleration in the index for services. Rents,
which are reflected in the index with a lag, rose more than in any
month since early 1971.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices dropped 1.5 per cent
in September, seasonally adjusted, as a result of a decline of
over 5 per cent in farm, food, and feed prices following an even
sharper climb in August. Meat, poultry and egg prices declined
sharply, but dairy prices rose sharply. Industrial prices rose
0.7 per cent, however. From June, when a general price freeze was
imposed, to September, wholesale prices climbed about 3 per cent and
farm and food prices 8 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis.

and processed foods and feeds.
Large price changes for livestock and meat in recent months
have reflected distortions in the market attributable to the ceiling
on red meat imposed in March, the freeze on processors and distributors
imposed in June, and to high but fluctuating grain and feed prices.
In July, as the adverse effect of the freeze on food supply became
apparent, food price controls were relaxed to allow processors and
distributors of food to pass through to consumers farm level cost
increases. Beef prices were an exception--ceilings were maintained
until September 10 causing marketings to be sharply curtailed. Pork
and broiler prices began to shoot up and grain and soybean prices also
soared in response to high world demand. The rapid rise in farm prices

continued until mid-August, when a sharp reversal toughly coincided
in time with the beginning of Phase IV.

Phase IV regulations in effect after August 12 allowed
dollar-for-dollar cost pass-throughs on non-farm commodity prices, subject
to profit-margin limitations. However, the largest firms were
restrained from price increases in September because of pre-notification
requirements. Nevertheless, industrial prices rose 0.7 per cent,
seasonally adjusted, in September, with continued large increases
for fuds and textiles. One major factor was a 35 cents a barrel boost
in crude oil on September 7 when Phase IV took effect for the oil
industry.
Since early September, metals, textiles, and petroleum
products have moved higher. The increases in prices granted thus
far to automobile companies on 1974 models will be approximately offset

I -28
by the quality improvements, so that, on a seasonally-adjusted basis
auto prices may drop in October. (Price rises to offset cost increases
will be delayed until all labor-management negotiations are completed.)
Price increases for sheet steel, detergents, gasoline, paper products
and tires have recently been approved by the CLC.
Agriculture. Prices received by farmers fell 8 per cent during
the month ending September 15, partly offsetting the record 20 per cent
rise of a month earlier. Livestock prices had fallen still further by
early October but grain and soybean prices had stabilized at the high mid-
September level. Strength in the grain and soybean markets recently has
resulted from delays in crop harvesting caused by rain.
September red meat production was 4 per cent above the August
level, seasonally adjusted, as increased cattle slaughter was partly offset
by a decline in hog marketings. But production was 8 per cent below
September a year ago. A 20-pound jump in the average weight of slaughter
cattle indicates that some back-up occurred while the beef price ceiling was
in effect, but marketings of these withheld animals has not been
enough to raise slaughter to last year's level.
Corn and soybean harvesting has just begun but, like last year,
delays caused by wet weather are developing as a factor (along with strong
world demand) keeping feed prices high. The consequent low profitability
in livestock feeding, dairy, and poultry operations provides no incentive
for exoansion of these food supplies.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
With published data continuing to indicate a weakening in the
monetary aggregates in the second half of September, a substantial rally
in credit markets developed as market participants anticipated an easing
of monetary policy. Apart from the Federal funds rate, short-term
market rates declined about 100 to 150 basis points on balance since the
last Committee meeting. Bond rates dropped as much as 30 basis points
since mid-September, and currently are 50 to 70 basis points below their
highs for the year. Some slight easing in average home mortgage rates
also appears to have developed.
Credit demands in September were quite moderate, particularly
in the business sector. Business loans at banks rose less than in any
month since June 1972. Part of this slowdown reflected a diversion of
credit demand to the commercial paper market as rates in that market
declined, but total short-term borrowing by businesses still increased
at the lowest rate in a year. In long-term markets, corporate offerings
of bonds and stocks were modest, with total new issue volume nearly a
third below the pace of the first eight months of the year.
As loan demands moderated, and as banks came to expect further
declines in short-term rates, CD issuance slowed in September and banks
experienced net run-offs late in the month and in early October. Inflows
of consumer-type time and savings deposit also slowed, particularly flows
into the four-year certificates at larger banks.

II -2
Outflows of funds from thrift institutions were quite mod-
erate in September, and these institutions are expected to show modest
seasonally adjusted net inflows for the month. Fragmentary information
suggests only moderate outflows during the late September and early
October reinvestment period.
Outlook. In the near-term, financial markets are likely to
remain unusually sensitive to indications of changes in the stance of
monetary policy, as well as to uncertainties generated by the war in
the Middle East. Markets already appear to have discounted some decline
in the Federal funds rate. Thus, if the funds rate were to remain
around recently prevailing levels, market rates would be likely to rise.
On the other hand, a fairly sizable drop in the funds rate could lead to
a further expectational decline in market rates in the near-term.
However, given our GNP forecast and associated credit demands, it would
appear that market rates of interest could come under upward pressure
by late fall or early winter.
External financing needs of corporations are projected to
expand as outlays for fixed investment and inventories grow more rapidly
than internal funds generation. Thus, corporations can be expected to
draw upon their liquidity and to increase their borrowing demands on
banks, other short-term credit markets, and the capital market. Under-
writers indicate that they have received increased inquiries about
capital market financing and are advising customers who need funds to
enter the market soon.

II -3
The Treasury and Federal agencies combined are expected to
borrow $8 to $10 billion in the fourth quarter (over and above the $1.8
billion bill issue of early October). While Agency financing could be
reduced somewhat by more favorable inflows at the thrift institutions,
any such improvement is likely to be moderate--especially if market
rates start to rise again. Even if inflows to the thrift institutions
pick up somewhat, the overhang of forward mortgage commitments, reduced
portfolio liquidity, and desire to repay high-cost FHLB borrowings are
likely to keep new residential mortgage commitment activity quite limited
at these lenders.
Monetary aggregates. Preliminary data for September indicate
a further weakening of the major monetary aggregates. M1 declined at
a 3,6 per cent annual rate, the second consecutive month of contraction.
Moreover, growth in M2 and M3 slowed significantly in September--to
rates of 2.2 and 1.9 per cent, respectively. The slower growth in M2
represents both the decline in M1 and a slower growth of consumer-type
time deposits at banks. Deposits at nonbank thrift institutions--included
in M --increased by a small amount, seasonally adjusted, in September
after decreasing in August.

The recent decline in M1 probably reflects the lagged
impact of the earlier sharp advance in interest rates, but late
September weakness also may have been associated with greater than
usual use of demand balances to finance corporate tax payments. The
August-September declines resulted in an essentially unchanged level
of M1 for the third quarter; over the year ending in September, M1
rose 5.2 per cent.
After rapid growth in August, time deposits other than
large CD's increased at a much slower pace in September. This reduced
rate of growth appeared to reflect mainly a tapering off in the
volume of 4 year certificates being issued by banks following the
initial surge in such deposit inflows in late July and early August,
In the 4 weeks ending September 26, such certificates outstanding
at weekly reporting banks increased by about $500 million after
having expanded by an average of $1 billion per month in July and
August.
Net sales of large CD's slowed markedly in September
despite relatively strong growth in the early part of the month.
Contributing importantly to the September rise was a $600 million
(not seasonally adjusted) increase in time deposits issued by
weekly reporting banks to other commercial banks--mainly, it appears,
in the form of large CD's--and this followed an even larger increase
in August. Apparently, smaller banks during this period found CD
offering rates at large banks relatively attractive. As market rates

II -6
began to drop around mid-September, banks apparently were slow to
adjust downward their offering rates on CD's, thus generating a
contra-seasonal inflow of such deposits over the September tax
payment period. However, with loan demands moderating and
influenced by the higher marginal reserve requirements and perhaps
by expectations of further declines in interest rates, banks sub-
sequently backed away from CD's. The ensuing cut in CD rates--
although not as large as the decline in other market rates--resulted
in a sharp run-off of these certificates late in the month and in
early October.
Fluctuating relationships between foreign and domestic
interest rates led to large week-to-week movements in bank
borrowings of Eurodollars during September; over the month, such
borrowings declined $250 million. Although this decline was
offset by continued growth in sales of bank-related commercial
paper, the resulting $200 million net increase in use of non-
deposit funds was considerably below the increases in the two
previous months. The weakness in both private deposit and non-
deposit sources of funds in September resulted in a sharp de-
celeration in the growth rate of the bank credit proxy to 5.4
per cent-- the lowest monthly growth rate in two years.

In September, the rate of growth of total loans and invest-
ments dropped sharply--to a 4.1 per cent annual rate. This slackening
reflected a sharp moderation in loan expansion--mainly to businesses.
As noted in the September Greenbook, the reported rate of growth of
business loans in August (on the old basis) appeared to be biased
upward. The revised credit data indicate that business loan expansion
in August--although still strong--was considerably less than originally
estimated. Furthermore, as noted earlier, little of the August
increase occurred after midmonth. This slowing continued in September
as business loans grew at a sharply reduced 3.1 per cent annual rate.
In part, the recent reduction in business loan growth may
reflect the more restrictive credit policies reported by banks in the
recent survey of lending practices. In addition, there have been
unconfirmed reports that U. S. businesses have been arranging to
borrow funds in the Euro-dollar markets--due to relative rate
advantages--which may have contributed to the slowing in domestic
business loan expansion. And, for the second consecutive month, there
was a decline in outstanding loans to foreign businesses, also
reflecting such a shift in relative interest rates.
Some moderation in bank loan demand also appears to have been
the result of the decline in commercial paper rates relative to bank
prime lending rates, and the decline in CD rates below the prime rate,
which has eliminated the incentive to borrow for investment in CD's.

II -9
Evidence of the increasing attractiveness of commercial paper financing
was indicated by the $1 billion increase in dealer-placed commercial
paper in September--the largest increase since June 1972. Even with
this sizable expansion, however, total business short-term credit
use, as measured by the sum of bank loans plus dealer-placed
commercial paper, increased at only a 10 per cent annual rate in
September--much less rapidly than in previous months of this year,
but about the same as in most of 1972.

Real estate loans continued to expand at a rapid rate in
September--16.2 per cent. Most other categories of loans--including
consumer loans--also remained strong. Banks liquidated Treasury
securities for the third consecutive month while adding moderately
to their holdings of other securities, primarily municipals and
agency issues.
The new monthly survey of bank loan commitments at 130
large banks, which will be discussed in more detail in the Supplement,
indicates a moderate increase in outstanding loan commitments to
businesses in August accompanied by a sharp increase in commitments
to nonbank financial institutions--presumably reflecting in part
efforts by thrift institutions to increase lines of credit as a hedge
against future deposit outflows. In contrast, the survey results
showed a moderate drop in mortgage commitments. It should be noted
that the loan commitment survey is new and untested, and the monthly
data are likely to be subject to considerable volatility.
Nonbank financial institutions. FHLBB estimates based on
sample data indicate that net deposit outflows at S&L's (before
interest crediting) were about $250 million in September--substantially
less than the $1.2 billion outflow in August. The September growth
rate for S&L's is projected at about 4.5 per cent (SAAR), although
this figure tends to overstate the improvement in deposit performance
since the large volume of interest crediting accounted for all the

II -11
deposit growth on unadjusted basis. However, these institutions
apparently fared relatively well during the grace day period at
month-end, as compared with other recent tight money periods.
The grace day experience of a sample of large New York
City mutual savings banks was also relatively favorable. Net out-
flows at these institutions were only moderately larger than in 1971
and 1972, and substantially less than in the comparable 1969 period.
A factor that may have contributed to the reduced pressure on thrift
institutions was the rapid decline in short-term market rates in
recent weeks. Moreover, it is likely that the greater portion of the
most interest sensitive depositors already had shifted funds out of
these institutions into higher yielding instruments.

After record increases in FHLB advances of $1.2 and $1.1
billion in July and August, S&L's borrowed $785 million from the
FHLBanks during September. This reduced rate of advances reflects
not only the better deposit experience at S&L's, but also continued
reductions in their holdings of liquid assets as well as the
restrictive lending policies of the FHLBanks. At the same time,
however, in response to the President's recent message on housing,
the FHLBB initiated effective September 24, a forward commitment
program designed to foster continued S&L participation in the mortgage
market. Under this plan, the FHLBanks are authorized to make up to
$2.5 billion in commitments to member S&L's to be taken down 6 months
to 1 year from the date of the commitment, at a rate of 8-1/2 per cent
plus 1/4 per cent commitment fee. By early October about $100 million
had been committed under this program, and an additional $430 million
in applications for such commitments had been received.
Although no data are available on life insurance company
policy loan activity since the recent decline in market rates, new
policy loans reached a record high during August. Data for 15 large
life insurance companies holding about 2/3 of all policy loans out-
standing indicate that gross loans made were nearly 50 per cent
higher than in July and exceeded by more than 25 per cent the previous
record month of July 1969. Although the cash position of life
insurance companies may have eroded somewhat recently, these

II -13
institutions entered the third quarter in a relatively strong liquidity
position which should provide some short-run cushion against larger
than expected policy loan demands.
Consumer credit. Net growth of consumer credit remained at
a high level during July and August, and it appears that the rate of
expansion during the third quarter as a whole will be close to the
record reached in the fourth quarter of 1972. During August, the
seasonally adjusted annual rate of increase in consumer credit slightly
exceeded $24 billion, or 14 per cent. For the 12 months ending in
August, consumer credit rose 16 per cent to a total of $172 billion,
with instalment debt up 17 per cent and noninstalment credit up 12
per cent. Part of the recent growth has reflected the influence of
higher prices on goods purchased, and possibly also inflation hedge-
buying of durable goods during Freeze II.
The rate of growth in auto credit, which had slackened from
January through June, turned up again this summer. The monthly
volume of credit extensions on purchased new car contracts increased
nearly 20 per cent at commercial banks and 16 per cent at finance
companies from July 1972 to July 1973; direct loan volume at banks
rose 17 per cent over this period. Part of the gain reflects an
increase in the average amount borrowed, which has risen about 7 per
cent.

II -14
Interest rates on automobile loans have risen significantly
since June. Finance company rates on purchased new car contracts
increased 8 basis points in July and another 11 basis points in
August, while bank rates on direct new car loans rose 2 points in
July and 15 basis points in August. By way of contrast, these rates
rose only 2 and 7 basis points, respectively, during the first half
of the year.
Commercial paper outstanding. Total commercial paper out-
standing increased an estimated $1.0 billion, seasonally adjusted, during
September. Nonbank-related dealer placed paper grew $1.0 billion, as
effective commercial paper rates declined relative to the bank prime
rate, encouraging some former issuers to return to the commercial paper
market. In addition, bank-related commercial paper increased $200
million.
Directly placed nonbank paper, on the other hand, declined
$200 million during the month, in part as a result of sharply curtailed
demand for funds by finance company subsidiaries of automobile companies.
Also, some firms--expecting stringent short-term market conditions over
the mid-September tax date--reportedly had issued paper in advance of
their needs in August, when finance company paper increased by an
exceptionally large $1.8 billion.

Short-term rates. Short-term interest rates have fallen
sharply, on balance, since the September FOMC meeting. Rates on
Treasury bills in the 3 and 6-month maturity areas, for example, which
had declined about 40 to 50 basis points in the week prior to that
meeting, have dropped an additional 100 to 150 basis points since then.
Similarly, rates on private short-term instruments, which had stabi-
lized at about their yearly highs in the week preceding the last meeting,
have since fallen from 90 to as much as 150 basis points.
Short-term rates began to decline sharply on the Thursday
following the September FOMC meeting, when a small outright System
purchase of Treasury bills was interpreted as signaling a modification
of the tight stance of monetary policy. Once underway, the rally
seemed to generate its own steam, with short rates generally moving

on an unbroken downward course through the remainder of September. In
the early part of last week, however, bill rates and bank CD rates backed
up sharply and other short rates stabilized. This interruption in the
downtrend apparently was attributable to a heavy schedule of Treasury
bill financing and an inability of market participants to perceive con-
firming evidence in the Federal funds market of any policy shift. Late
last week, the downtrend in short-term rates resumed, as market partici-
pants again concluded that monetary policy had shifted toward ease.

II -17
Evidence leading to this conclusion included the continued weakness
displayed in recent data on the monetary aggregates and the sharp
drop in net borrowed reserves during the statement week ended last
Wednesday, when the System had been active in supplying reserves.
Desk injection of reserves last Friday, when the Federal funds market
was already easing, also added further strength to the renewed down-
ward trend.
Treasury and agency financing. The Treasury securities market
generally continues in a strong technical position. Dealers presently
are carrying relatively small positions in both coupon issues and bills,
with holdings of bills in the 3-month or less maturity area being
unusually low.
On October 3, the Treasury auctioned $1.8 billion of 42-week
bills, at an average rate of 7.70 per cent, thus filling the 13th slot
in its 52-week bill cycle. Over the remainder of the calendar year,
the Treasury probably will need to raise at least an additional $2
billion, and quite possibly as much as $4 billion of new money. To
cover this need, the Treasury's temporary debt ceiling must be raised
from the current level of $465 billion, since there is only about $2.0
billion of leeway under the current ceiling level and even this will
expire at the end of November. Present staff projections suggest that
the Treasury could postpone borrowing in the market until the mid-Nov-
ember refunding. If it begins to appear that Congress may delay in
renewing the Treasury's authority to borrow from the Federal Reserve,
however, it is possible that the Treasury will push forward its borrowing
to early November in order to build some precautionary balances.

II -18
Pressures to be placed on credit markets by Federal agency
issues (including sales of financial assets) between now and the end of
the year appear to be about as projected in the last Greenbook. That
is, the total volume of issues to be absorbed by the market in the
fourth quarter should amount to about $6 billion.
Long-term security markets. The rally in corporate, municipal,
and long-term government security markets which began in early August
continued throughout September. On balance, long-term rates have
dropped about 50 to 75 basis points from their August peaks. The
rally was sparked initially by technical factors--low dealer inventories
and the need to cover short positions. But it was sustained increasingly
by market expectations of an easing in monetary policy at a time of
relatively light new issue volume.
In the past few weeks stock prices also have advanced steadily
in unusually heavy trading. Since mid-September the Dow Jones Industrial
average has risen more than 90 points, or 10 per cent, closing at 974 on
October 9. During this period daily trading volume averaged over 21
million shares compared to an average of 12 million shares per day in
August. The rally appears to have been broadly based and dealers
apparently have encountered no major problems in handling the increased
volume.
The September volume of new publicly offered corporate bonds
is estimated to have been about $575 million, about $200 million less
than forecast in the September Greenbook because of the rescheduling
for October of one large offering expected late in September. With

public bond volume at the lowest monthly level in over four years, a
moderate volume of stock offerings, and only a seasonal rise in private
placements, total corporate security volume in September was well below
that in earlier months this year.
The volume of corporate public bonds is expected to pick up
considerably in October and November. Current schedulings by utilities
are relatively high, and the calendar also includes several offerings
by industrial and financial firms. Underwriters report that the
recent decline in interest rates, along with corporate desires to fund
short-term debt and increasing needs for external financing because of

II -20
higher plant and equipment expenditures, has prompted an increasing
number of inquiries from industrial firms concerning bond financing.
Depending on market conditions and interest rate expectations, under-
writers believe that a significant build-up in bond offerings could
occur late this year.
The September volume of municipal offerings was somewhat
lighter than expected--$1,600 million--due mainly to postponements of
several issues apparently because of expectations of lower interest
rates in the future. In October the volume is expected to rise to
about $1,750 million because of a bunching of large issues. The November
calendar probably will drop to about $1,600 million. State and local
governments continue to show large budgetary surpluses and maintain
excellent liquidity positions. An increasing amount of the municipal
volume is made up of industrial pollution control bonds. New offerings
of this type of bond averaged $134 million per month in the first six
months of this year, compared to an average monthly volume of $50
million in 1972.

Mortgage market. With securities market yields down substan-
tially from their summer highs, a growing number of mortgage market
analysts believe that rates in this market also have peaked and may now
move downward, While the supply of new mortgage commitments has con-
tinued quite restrictive, there are field and other reports of some
recent slackening in credit demand.
In the primary mortgage market, the FHLMC weekly survey of
120 S&L's indicates that contract interest rates on home mortgages
edged down in early October, following increases of more than 10 basis
points a week on average from early July through early September. On
October 5, the average rate on 80 per cent conventional home loans
dipped to 8.82 per cent, the first week-to-week decline since late
January. Meanwhile, with mortgage rates still high and bond rates
declining considerably from earlier peaks, the gross yield spread
favoring mortgages over new issues of high-grade corporate bonds has
widened from minus 12 basis points in early August to plus 100 basis
points or more in most recent weeks.
The secondary mortgage market also has shown some signs of a
turnaround. This change is confirmed not only by the weekly FHLMC
survey of S&L's but also by the FNMA bi-weekly auction results. In
the October 1 FNMA auction of short-term commitments to purchase FHA-
and VA-underwritten home mortgages, the yield on an unusually small
volume of offerings averaged 9.11 per cent--down 26 basis points from
the average in the previous auction. 1/
1/ Among the influences limiting the volume of offerings in the October 1
FNMA auction were: (a) seller expectations of declining market rates; (b)
uncertainty about the extension of FHA mortgage insurance authority, which
lapsed briefly at the end of September and then was extended for one year by
Public Law 93-117, effective October 2; and (c) increased reliance by sellers
on marketing arrangements involving issuance of GNMA-guaranteed securities
backed by mortgage pools.

Agricultural finance. Farm credit demand continued strong through
August. Lending at production credit associations was unusually active,
resulting in a contraseasonal rise in outstanding loans during August to
a level 13 per cent above a year earlier.
Longer-term farm mortgage lending also continued its strong pace.
For the year ended August 31, the volume of new loans closed by Federal
Land Banks was up 62 per cent from the preceding 12-month period, and
outstanding volume on August 31 was 20 per cent above a year earlier.

II -25
In reaction to their rising cost of funds, the Federal Land
Banks have made upward adjustments since July in billing rates on their
outstanding variable-rate mortgages. 1/ With four FLB's raising their
billing rate to 8 per cent on October 1, rates at the 12 FLB's now range
between 7.5 and 8 per cent, in contrast to the 7 to 7.5 per cent range
that prevailed from January through July. Rates on farm production
loans at banks and production credit associations also rose rapidly
during the summer months. Rates most commonly charged are now in the
8 to 9 per cent range, generally more than 100 basis points above a
year earlier.
Federal finance. Current staff estimates indicate a unified
budget deficit of nearly $1.7 billion for fiscal year 1974, a net
change of $2.8 billion from the surplus previously projected. Revised
receipts and outlays are now projected at $269.6 billion and $271.3
billion, respectively.
Due largely to a downward revision in our estimate of the
effective personal tax rate, the forecast of total receipts for fiscal
year 1974 has been lowered by $1.3 billion. An apparent shortfall in
corporate tax collections for September suggests that corporations may
be finding ways to postpone some tax payments until the second half
of this fiscal year, in view of recently higher interest rates.
1/ Federal Land Banks first offered variable rate mortgages in 1969
and have since put all new loans on this plan, so that variable
rate mortgages now represent about 70 per cent of their outstanding
loans of $10.4 billion. Because the FLB's are cooperatives owned
by the borrowers, the billing rate on these mortgages is set to
reflect the average cost of funds plus a mark-up to cover operating
expenses. During a period of rising market interest rates, FLB
billing rates will tend to lag the upward move, because each FLB's
average cost of funds will rise only as new money must be raised
and as maturing issues must be refinanced.

II -26
Budgetary developments in recent months indicate strong pressures
for spending in excess of the Administration's target for fiscal 1974.
However, because the Administration seems determined to hold down
spending, these developments have been only partly incorporated into
our forecasts. We have thus raised total fiscal year spending by $1.6
billion, making our current estimate $2.6 billion more than the Adminis-
tration's $268.7 billion figure. Two recent Senate bills would add
either 5.9 or 7.0 per cent to social security benefits as soon as
enacted, replacing the previously legislated 5.9 per cent increase not
due to take effect until July 1974. While no formal House action has
been taken, there appears to be little opposition to some speed-up in
benefit payments. Our present forecast, therefore, assumes a 5.9 per
cent benefit hike effective in January, adding $1.6 billion to fiscal
1974 expenditures. While the net effect of Congressional actions
already taken would raise outlays by an additional $2.8 billion over
the Administration's fiscal year target, an expected $1 -2 billion
cut in defense appropriations would offset much of this effect.
Moreover, increased appropriations for domestic programs may be vetoed
(or impounded) if they are not consistent with the Administration's goal
of limiting spending since Administration goals are already being
threatened by increased spending in uncontrollable categories such as
interest.
Our high employment budget forecast continues to show a strong
shift toward surplus in calendar year 1974. While about half of this
movement is due to the effect of inflation on tax receipts, and thus
does not reflect discretionary fiscal policy, the shift, nevertheless,
does reflect budgetary restraint on the economy.

The end-of-September Treasury cash balance was $8.3 billion,
$1.1 billion less than we had projected in the September Greenbook,
apparently reflecting both stronger expenditures and weaker receipts.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. The U.S. balance of payments improved
further in the third quarter. There was a surplus on the official
settlements basis in that period of about $1-1/2 billion (seasonally
adjusted, not at an annual rate), compared with a surplus of less than
$1/2 billion in the second quarter. The improved showing was accounted
for by the behavior of current account transactions and long-term capital
flows -- the components of the basic balance. In particular, the trade
balance improved further in July-August, foreign purchases of U.S.
securities increased substantially, and long-term U.S. bank lending
to foreigners appears to have declined. Thus, the basic balance in
the third quarter may have been only a very small deficit -- less than
$1 billion at an annual rate -- compared with $3 billion in the second
quarter.
The outlook for further gains in the basic balance in the
immediate future appears to be good. The trade balance is expected to
move into surplus, as exports, already buoyed by high agricultural
shipments, advance further while imports expand less strongly. Prices
for imports are likely to continue rising, but the volume of imports
(aside from fuels) seems likely to decline somewhat in line with the
projected slowing in the somestic economic advance. Foreign orders for
U.S. machinery jumped sharply in August, reaching a record level,
indicating probable further substantial gains in nonagricultural exports.

III -2
The recent heavy foreign purchases of U.S. stocks and bonds
seem likely to continue, at least in the near term. These expanded
purchases may reflect, among other things, a view that the U.S. dollar
will continue to strengthen in foreign-exchange markets, an impression
that interest rates on U.S. bonds may have peaked, and an expectation
of further rises in the prices of U.S. stocks.
A major uncertainty in the balance-of-payments outlook is
the effect of the new conflict in the Middle East, and the extent to
which prices of oil imports will rise as a result of actions taken
by foreign oil-supplying countries, not only those in the Middle East
and North Africa but also Canada and Venezuela. Future developments
in these areas may require a reassessment of our current account
estimates for 1974.
Foreign exchange markets. Exchange markets have again turned
quiet in the past few weeks following a period of unsettlement ensuing
upon the surprise revaluation of the Dutch guilder on September 15.
Dollar exchange rates for major foreign currencies have changed little,
on balance, since immediately after the guilder revaluation. The Bank
of Japan continues to sell large amounts of dollars, and, in recent days,
the Netherlands Bank has purchased substantial amounts of dollars on
a swap basis. Otherwise there has been no substantial net intervention
in dollars by major foreign central banks. The outbreak of hostilities
in the Middle East has as yet had little effect on the exchanges.

III -3
The five per cent revaluation of the guilder caught the market
completely off guard. The guilder had moved to the top of the European
band in the previous few days but Dutch reserve gains from intra-European
intervention were not large (less than $200 million equivalent, certainly
the smallest reserve change for a major country ever to precede a parity
change). Dutch authorities cited, however, a major strengthening of the
current account balance and stated that the revaluation was intended as
part of an anti-inflationary program.
The market immediately turned its attention to the Belgian
franc and the French franc as candidates for revaluation and devaluation,
respectively. Very quickly speculation spread to the mark, which replaced
the Belgian franc as the currency in greatest excess demand. The central
banks of Germany, France and Belgium intervened heavily in support of the
European band limits. Total intervention in French francs amounted to
something on the order of $2 billion equivalent (mostly in marks) in the
week of September 17-21. In moving to combat the speculation the Bank
of France acted to raise French interest rates, while on the other side
the Belgian central bank re-imposed a negative interest charge on non-
resident deposits and the German Federal Bank did not immediately move
to absorb the additional domestic liquidity created by exchange market
intervention in marks. The combination of these moves together with the
substantial intervention tended to dampen speculation, and by September 24
the pressures had subsided sufficiently to render unnecessary any further
intervention.

III -4
The speculation in European currencies was mostly confided to
the sale of one European currency for another -- there was only minor
spillover into dollar exchange rates. The System and the Bundesbank
did sell marks against dollars as the dollar eased somewhat against the
mark, but most of this intervention was reversed subsequently as the
dollar turned firmer.
After the markets had been quiet for two weeks, Germany acted
to soak up excess domestic liquidity by raising reserve requirements and
reducing banks' discount quotas, while Belgium dropped its negative interest
charge and France dropped its restrictions on banks' franc loans to for-
eigners, abolished its 100 per cent reserve requirement on non-resident
deposits and lifted its ban on the payment of interest on non-resident
deposits. (During this period the Swiss also dropped their negative interest
charge on non-resident deposits, which had been in effect since June, 1972).
In recent days the guilder firmed on the basis of a very tight
domestic money market, and the Netherlands Bank acted to ease the pressures
by purchasing nearly $500 million on a swap basis from Dutch commercial
banks. The guilder moved to its upper Benelux limit and the Belgian franc
has received a modest amount of central bank support against the guilder.
The relative weakness of the Belgian franc in the Benelux band encouraged
the System to step up its regular purchases of Belgian francs to repay
pre-August, 1971 swaps.
Among non-European currencies, the Canadian dollar has tended
to firm over the past month, while sterling has held very steady, and
the yen has eased against the dollar. The Bank of Japan sold nearly

$800 million between September 12 and October 10, reflecting continued
large deficits in Japan's basic balance.
Gold moved under $100 on October 1 for the first time in several
months and has generally stayed below that level, despite the events in

Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates have eased over
the past four weeks in line with the decline in U.S. money market rates
during this period. The differentials between Euro-dollar and comparable
maturity U.S. money market rates are little changed from their levels
of one month ago.
Three-month Euro-dollar deposits were bid at an average rate
of 10-3/4 per cent in the week ended October 10, 70 basis points below
the average for the week ended September 12. The three-month CD rate
declined by a similar amount during this period and remained 1 percentage
below the three-month Euro-dollar rate. The average overnight Euro-dollar
and Federal funds rates stood in near equality at approximately 10-3/4
per cent for the week ended October 10, the same position they held four
weeks ago. In the interim, the overnight Euro-dollar rate was below the
Federal funds rate on most days, but overnight Euro-dollar borrowing
subject to the 8 per cent reserve requirement has remained more expensive
than Federal funds borrowing throughout the past month.
U.S. banks' borrowings from their foreign branches averaged
$1,940 million in the week ended October 3, a decrease of $67 million
from the average level of borrowings in the week of September 12.

U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary data indicate that the
balance on the official settlements basis in the third quarter was a
surplus of about $1-1/2 billion (seasonally adjusted). This compares
with a surplus of less than $1/2 billion in the second quarter. While
information on most major components of the balance of payments in the
third quarter is still very incomplete, the data available for July and
August on trade, security transactions and U.S. bank claims on foreigners
suggest that the improvement in the official settlements balance in the
third quarter largely reflected a reduction in the "basic" deficit (on
current transactions and long-term capital flows). The "basic" deficit,
which was about $3 billion at an annual rate in the second quarter, may
have declined to a rate of about $1 billion in the third quarter. While
continued inflows of short-term capital contributed to the official
settlements surplus in the third quarter, these appear to have been
smaller than in the second quarter.
The trade balance for July-August was about zero, compared with
deficits of $4 and $1 billion at annual rates in the first and second
quarters, respectively. Led by an extremely large increase in the value
of shipments of agricultural commodities, total exports in July-August
continued to advance at a faster pace than imports (see below).
Foreign net purchases of U.S. equities picked up sharply in
July and August -- averaging $325 per month -- and brokers report further
heavy foreign purchases in September. The estimated $1 billion of foreign

III -8
net purchases in the third quarter (not at an annual rate) is considerably
greater than the $150 million of purchases recorded in the second quarter
and approaches the record $1-1/4 billion purchased in the first quarter.
Private foreigr purchases of U.S. bonds in July and August were also up
over the second quarter level. Foreign purchases of Euro-bond issues of
U.S. corporations (used to finance, in part, operations of U.S. foreign
affiliates) are again expanding sharply following a slump in the second
quarter; purchases of other types of U.S. bonds, particularly by investors
in Western Europe, are also quite strong. U.S. purchases of foreign bonds
in July-August show little change from the relatively small amounts of
the earlier months of the year. However, greater purchases are
anticipated in the fourth quarter as Canadian provinces step up bond
flotations in the U.S. to finance extensive new hydro-electric projects.
U.S. bank-reported long-term claims on foreigners were reduced
somewhat in July-August, following moderate increases in both the first
and second quarters of this year. Short-term bank-reported claims in
August also declined, partly offsetting a large rise in July. Preliminary
weekly data indicate a further decline in claims in September. It
appears that U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks increased their
claims on foreigners in August, but increased their liabilities to
foreigners by about the same amount, thus holding their foreign net assets
subject to the VFCR program at the June 30 level, as requested by the
Federal Reserve Board in July.

U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. trade balance in August was a
deficit of $1.1 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (balance
of payments basis), compared to a July surplus (revised) of $1.0 billion,
as exports continued to rise but imports rose faster. While agricultural
exports increased by 20 percent to a record $20 billion annual rate
(partly due to price rises but also due to an increased volume of wheat
and corn shipments), the value of nonagricultural exports declined
slightly. About two-thirds of the strong August increase in imports
was due to a sharp recovery in fuel imports after a temporary dip in
July. All other major import categories increased as well in spite
of work stoppages in Canada which depressed imports from that country.
For July-August combined, the trade balance was zero. This
was an improvement of about $1 billion at an annual rate from the second
quarter. Exports in July-August increased by 6 percent, while imports
increased by 4 percent.

Agricultural exports accounted for about half of the total
increase in exports from the second quarter to July-August. All of the
increase was due to price rises as the volume of shipments fell slightly.
The value of nonagricultural exports in July-August increased
4-1/2 percent from the second quarter. This increase was smaller than
the increase in the first or second quarters but was about the same rate
of increase as in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Virtually
all of the increase was due to higher prices as the volume of non-
agricultural exports has held steady since April (at a rate 20 percent
above the average 1972 level) perhaps because of supply shortages in
some industries. Declines in the volume of industrial supplies and
consumer goods were offset by a small increase in the volume of machinery
exports. In addition, foreign orders for U.S. machinery (which account
for one-third of nonagricultural exports) rose very steeply in August
from already high levels. This augers well for exports of these items
in the future, particularly if domestic demand slows down as expected.
The 4 percent increase in the value of imports from the
second quarter to July-August resulted mainly from strong increases
in the value of most major import categories -- particularly cars from
Europe and Japan, fuels, and nonferrous metals. Most of the increases
can be attributed to higher prices. The major elements accounting for
the leveling in the volume of imports since March appear to be higher
prices for imports resulting from the exchange rate realignments and
some supply limitations abroad.

III -11
Price and wage developments in major foreign industrial
countries. Inflation rates in industrial countries on average have
been markedly higher in the early 1970's than they were even in the
second half of the 1960's. But the price changes observed over the
past nine months or so have been extraordinarily high even within
this generally accelerating trend. The slight deceleration in the
rate of increase in the wholesale prices of manufactured products
in recent months, as shown in Table 1, still leaves the rates of
increase unusually high for most countries.
Largely as a result of the simultaneity of strong economic
demand in virtually all industrial countries since late last year,
and low agricultural output in many producing countries, the export
prices of primary commodities have increased sharply this year. As
indicated in Table 2, the United Nations' dollar-based index of
commodity prices increased at an annual rate of 42.3 per cent from
the fourth quarter of last year to the second quarter of this year.
This rate of increase was triple that between the second and fourth
quarters of last year and can only partly be attributed to the dollar
devaluation this year. Prices of agricultural commodities registered
the sharpest increase, but prices for fuels and metal ores also
increased substantially.
Wages have increased at relatively high rates this year,
and except for Japan and Germany (during the first quarter), have not

been matched by equivalent gains in productivity. But with the large
price rises, labor costs per unit of turnover have probably decreased
or, at least, are no higher than last year, so that unit profits have
continued to rise or have remained stable.
In most industrialized countries, real incomes have increased
since wage gains have generally exceeded the rise in consumer prices.
The main exception is Canada where wages have increased only slightly
faster than consumer prices.
In the United Kingdom, the rate of increase in retail prices
has predictably accelerated since April of this year when the price-
freeze imposed under Phase I of the price/wage control program was

III -14
superseded by Phase II. But even after the post-Phase I bulge, price
increases were higher than in the preceding year. Between June and
August, retail prices excluding seasonal food items rose at a 7.8 per
cent annual rate, considerably more than the 6.6 per cent rate of a
year earlier. Sharply higher prices for food, the introduction of the
VAT on April 1, and the devaluation of the pound, combined with rising
world commodity prices, have all contributed to the faster price trend.
However, the rate of increase at the wholesale price level
may have reached its peak in the third quarter when it was 6.4 per cent
higher than in August-October of 1972, the last three months before
Phase I.
Despite the accelerating trend in living costs, wage rates
have been increasing at only a slightly higher rate than last year.
In August basic hourly wage rates were 15-1/2 per cent higher than in
the same month a year earlier. Labor productivity in manufacturing
has increased very rapidly, and in the second quarter was up an extra-
ordinary 11 per cent as compared to the same period a year earlier.
Although unit labor costs have been rising slightly, with higher prices,
profit margins have been largely unaffected and total profits have
been rising.
On October 8, Prime Minister Heath announced proposals for
Phase III of the price/incomes policy, to become effective in November

III -15
and to last for about a year. It is proposed that weekly wage rates
be allowed to rise 7 per cent (or an average of £2.25 per person).
If the retail price index rises at the same -- 7 per cent -- rate
during Phase III, wages can be increased by another £0.4 a week plus
£0.4 a week for each additional 1 percentage point increase in the
price index. Profit margins and dividends will again be controlled to
limit price increases.
It would seem that in Germany some progress is being made
toward slowing the rate of inflation, although the signs are still
not very conclusive. Consumer prices have increased somewhat more
slowly since June of this year, but the slower rate of rise was
primarily because of an easing in the food supply situation. More
significantly, the rate of increase in non-food prices, although still
high, seems to be slowing slightly.
Some further evidence of a beginning success in containing
inflation rates may be seen in the slight deceleration of the rise in
wholesale prices of manufactured products in recent months, from a
rate of 8.6 per cent to 7.1 per cent.
From mid-1972 through the first quarter of this year, large
productivity gains roughly matched the increase in wages, so that unit
labor costs were virtually flat. In the second quarter of this year,
however, productivity gains halted, so that unit labor costs rose by
3-1/2 per cent over the preceding quarter. Preliminary data indicate

III -16
that this pattern may well have continued in the third quarter.
Accordingly, if price rises moderate further, profit margins, which
are quite wide currently, may shrink sufficiently to add a further
cost-push element to the inflationary situation.
In France, as in most industrial countries, the rate of
increase in both consumer and wholesale prices accelerated early this
year. But the rise in wholesale prices, as elsewhere,has begun to
moderate a little and the rise in consumer prices for non-food items,
while continuing to accelerate, is considerably less than in other
countries. Large increases in food prices, however, have brought the
annual rate of increase in the consumer price index to about 7-1/2%,
well within the range of other countries' inflation rates.
Hourly wages presently are rising at a 14 per cent annual
rate, with no slowdown in sight as most wage contracts, as well as the
minimum wage, are tied to the consumer price index. Shortages of
skilled labor and the threat of continuing labor unrest are adding
to wage pressures. Thus, despite substantial productivity gains,
unit labor costs are increasing, but at a rather lesser rate than in
previous periods of inflationary pressure.
In Italy, the strong inflationary pressures have prompted the
Government to extend beyond October 16 the three-month price freeze for
essential foodstuffs and other goods introduced in July. Until the

II -17
freeze, consumer prices were rising at an 11-1/2% annual rate with food
prices increasing even faster.
With the introduction of the VAT in January 1973, movements
in the wholesale price index are not comparable to those of earlier
years, but there has clearly been an acceleration also in wholesale
prices. Some of the major factors contributing to the price accelera-
tion, in addition to the introduction of the VAT, were the depreciation
of the lire coupled with sharp increases in the prices of imported foods
and raw materials.
New three-year wage contracts were negotiated late in 1972
and it has been estimated that as a result of heavy "front-loading" of
the contracts plus supplementary cost-of-living adjustments, labor costs
per person in manufacturing will increase about 18 per cent in 1973.
With an estimated increase in labor productivity of about 4.5 per cent
this year, unit labor costs will rise about 13.5 per cent, adding a
strong wage-push factor to the Italian inflation. Profits margins,
which recovered somewhat in 1972, are expected to be squeezed again
this year as unit labor costs rise substantially. But if the problem
of labor unrest is indeed solved, and output can rise steadily, the
total profit situation may well improve. So far proposed Government
action to reduce the burden of social insurance costs imposed on
employers has not materialized and may well have been postponed
indefinitely.

III -18
Despite the Japanese revaluation of the yen, prices have
accelerated even faster than in the devaluing countries. To some
extent the increase in the Japanese rate of inflation reflects a
rebound from the relatively stable price situation during the 1971
recession. Nevertheless, inflation rates are higher now than at any
time since the Korean War.
Consumer prices in September were 14.5 per cent higher than
a year earlier and wholesale prices in August were up 17.4 per cent.
The main factors contributing to the rise in prices have been the
strong domestic demand, sharply higher import prices for foodstuffs,
textiles and lumber, and some supply constraints. The revaluation of
the yen this year has helped some in holding down the rise in import
prices, but this has been more than offset by the sharp increase in
commodity prices on world markets.
Wages paid in the manufacturing sector have also been
accelerating and in the first seven months of this year were up 20
per cent over the same period a year earlier. But labor productivity --
as output rose rapidly in the first half of this year -- was up 20 per
cent over the same period a year earlier. As a result of these high
productivity gains, unit labor costs have been relatively stable and
business profits have expanded sharply. In the six months ending in
March 1973, business profits were up 47 per cent over the same period
a year earlier, whereas in the previous six-month period they were up
only 7 per cent.

III -19
In Canada, a substantial increase in food prices has been the
main factor contributing to the acceleration of consumer prices. Whole-
sale prices, as in the United States, reflect the high world-wide
demand for agricultural products and raw materials. In June prices
for these commodities were up 26 and 30-1/2 per cent, respectively,
over a year earlier. Finished goods prices are rising at a lesser, but
still accelerating rate.
Hourly earnings have been rising at about a 9-1/2 per cent
annual rate this year. This is close to double the rise in productivity,
so that unit labor costs have been rising at about a 4 per cent rate.
Nevertheless, business profits per unit of output rose sharply
during the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter they
fell back to a rate only slightly higher than the still substantial
13-1/2 per cent recorded in 1972. This suggests that eroding profit
margins cannot be cited as a cause of inflationary pressure.

APPENDIX A: BANK CREDIT REVISION
The seasonally adjusted series on commercial bank credit and its
major components have been revised. The revision included the updating of
seasonal adjustment factors and the usual benchmark revision that incorporates
the latest Call Report data, June 30, 1973, for nonmember banks. Major
changes were made in seasonal factors beginning in 1968 with minor scattered
changes back to 1964. The benchmark revision covered the January-September
1973 period.
June Call Report data indicate that growth in commercial bank
credit was at a somewhat faster pace in the first half of 1973 than had
been estimated previously on the basis of incomplete information. As a
result, the level of the series for this period has been raised by $4.3
billion (Table 1). Over two-thirds of this amount was accounted for by
increased investment holdings, particularly municipal and other securities,
which were sharply higher--$2.3 billion (Table 3). This was a considerably
larger dollar adjustment than required in any previous benchmark revision.
Total loans were somewhat higher on the revised basis, reflecting a sharp
upward revision in real estate loans--and smaller upward revisions in
security, agricultural, and "other loans"--offset in part by downward re-
visions in loans to businesses and nonbank financial institutions. (Con-
sumer loans--which are taken from Consumer Credit statistics--were not
affected by the benchmark revision.) As with "other securities", the upward
adjustment in real estate loans--$2.3 billion--was a record amount (Table 6).
On the other hand, business loans were $1.5 billion lower than previously
estimated (Table 5)--one of the few Call dates for which the level of this
series had been estimated too high. However, most of the difference reflected
an error in estimating "window-dressing" between June 27 and June 30. There-
fore, the basic level of the series was little changed and the only substantial
monthly adjustments, occurring in June and July, were about offsetting.
The level of total loans and investments also was increased over
the first half of 1973 as a result of the review and recomputation of sea-
sonal adjustment factors. Seasonal pattern changes indicated that seasonally
adjusted total credit increased $2.2 billion more on the revised basis than
on the old basis over this period. Over the third quarter, however, credit
expansion was $1.6 billion less than previously estimated with most of the
downward adjustment occurring in August. Although the pattern of month-to-
month fluctuations in credit growth has been revised substantially for the
entire first half, all the additional expansion was concentrated in the
second quarter.
* The revised seasonal factors were prepared by Edward R. Fry and Mary F.
Weaver, and the benchmark revisions by Mary Jane Harrington, Banking
Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

Seasonal pattern changes are most evident in loans and in holdings
of U.S. Treasury securities. Growth in holdings of other securities is now
indicated to have been less rapid in the first quarter and more rapid in the
second quarter than previously, but remains the same for the two quarters
combined. The faster pace continued into the third quarter. Over the first
half, the reduction in U.S. Treasury securities was $900 million less on the
revised basis than on the old, with most of the revision in the second quarter
(Table 2). In the third quarter, the new data show that holdings declined
nominally. These changes in seasonal factors reflect in part changed Treasury
financing patterns during the period under review.
Additional expansion in total loans--like total credit--was
concentrated in the second quarter and was followed by a substantial slow-
ing in the third quarter with a very sharp moderation in August (Table 4).
Seasonal changes reduced growth in business loans by $1.7 billion in that
month and also reduced expansion in loans to security dealers and to nonbank
financial institutions by lesser amounts. The only other major change in
business loans indicated by seasonal factors was a $900 million upward
adjustment in June; changes in other months were small reductions and
resulted in little change over the January-June period. Only nominal re-
visions were made in seasonal factors for real estate loans.
New seasonally adjusted data, on which the tables are based, are
preliminary and may be subject to minor changes. Final seasonally adjusted
series for all bank credit series will be available from the Banking Section
later in October.
