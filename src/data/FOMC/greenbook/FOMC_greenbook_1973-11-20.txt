Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Aggregate output and employment have continued to expand
appreciably, though less rapidly than earlier this year. Recent
declines in prices of farm products and foods have tempered the rate
of over-all price advances but non-food commodity prices have continued
to rise rapidly. Capacity constraints continue to limit expansion in
a number of important areas, and the fuel crisis is adding major uncer-
tainties to prospects for output and prices.
In October, industrial production increased 0.6 per cent from
a September level which has been revised slightly downward. Output of
business equipment continued strongly expansive and output of consumer
goods advanced further, but materials production showed little change,
in part reflecting constraints imposed by available capacity.
The labor market recently has strengthened. In October, the
unemployment rate dropped from 4.8 per cent to 4.5 per cent, the lowest
level since the spring of 1970. Nonfarm payroll employment has shown a
resurgence; the October rise amounted to 300,000, with manufacturing
employment up for the first significant increase since June. Upward
revisions for August and September have brought the rise in total non-
farm employment in the latest three months to an annual rate of over
3 million.
Revised data indicate that retail sales in the third quarter
were not so sluggish as originally reported. In October, retail sales
rose 2 per cent according to the advance report. Unit sales of new
autos, however, were weak. Shortages of small models relative to

I -2
demand may have contributed to the decline, as well as consumer
dissatisfaction with some features of the new models.
Inventory investment has remained exceptionally moderate
relative to activity levels; delays and/or inability to obtain desired
stocks probably have been an important factor holding down inventory
accumulation. Business plans to spend on plant and equipment are still
strong, however, as evidenced by the recent McGraw-Hill survey. Although
the rise in new orders for nondefense equipment has moderated, unfilled
orders have mounted further even though output of business equipment
has continued to increase rapidly.
Wage rates have continued to advance rapidly, with the hourly
earnings index up about 7-1/2 per cent at an annual rate since March.
In the nonfarm economy, productivity growth was at a relatively slow
pace in the third quarter, and unit labor costs rose rapidly.
Wholesale prices of farm products and foods declined further
from September to October, but were still 4-1/2 per cent above the June
level, prior to the freeze. The rise in industrial prices accelerated
in October--to 1.1 per cent for the month--with the index 9 per cent
above a year earlier. Higher prices for petroleum products accounted
for much of the October increase, but price advances were widespread.
In September, the rise in the consumer price index had moderated because
of lower prices for foods, but the index was about 7-1/2 per cent above
a year earlier.

I -3
Outlook. The following staff assumptions are incorporated
in the GNP projections: (1) Growth in M1 will average about 5 per cent
or so over the projection period. Under this assumption, short-term
money market rates are expected to average close to current levels
during 1974, but long-term rates are expected to move up somewhat
further next year. (2) Federal defense expenditures in calendar 1974
have been raised $1.5 billion, reflecting replacement of military equip-
ment going to Israel. (3) Price and wage controls will be continued
beyond the April expiration date, but with further selective decontrol
as the year unfolds. (4) Because of uncertainties as to the time
period over which oil imports may be restricted, and as to probable
allocation programs, no specific allowance has been made for the effects
of an acute oil shortage on real economic activity.
Real GNP is now projected to rise at an annual rate of 3.8
per cent this quarter, rather than the 3.5 per cent indicated in the
October Greenbook. Looking forward to 1974, the most important changes
from the projection of five weeks ago are higher rates of real GNP
growth and a somewhat faster rate of price increase. The unemployment
rate is now projected to rise from a low of 4.6 per cent in the current
quarter to 5.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1974.
The higher rate of growth in real GNP projected for 1974
reflects somewhat more strength in several demand sectors. Business
outlays for fixed capital are now projected to increase over 12 per cent
for the year. The upward revision reflects additional evidence of
strong demands for new capacity and other purposes, and takes into

I -4
account the recent McGraw-Hill Survey. The projected decline in
housing starts and residential construction has been tempered because
savings inflows have improved and are now expected to hold up better
than earlier assumed. On the other hand, net exports of goods and
services are expected to rise less in 1974 from a higher fourth
quarter level than had been assumed previously. Growth in consumer
spending has been raised relatively little despite a faster rise than
projected earlier for wage rates and disposable income.
Nonfood commodity prices are now expected to increase some-
what more rapidly than appeared likely five weeks ago. The GNP private
fixed weight deflator is projected to rise at an annual rate of 5
per cent in the second half of 1974, rather than 4-1/2 per cent pro-
jected previously. Underlying the present projection are expected
higher unit labor costs, the pervasive effects of fuel and other materials
shortages, and the effects of gradual and selective decontrol of wages
and prices.

Industrial production. Industrial production rose 0.6 per
cent further in October, following a slightly downward revised September
increase of 0.5 per cent. The October index at 127.8 per cent of the
1967 average was 7.2 per cent above a year ago. Over the month, output
gains were widespread among consumer goods and business equipment but
production of industrial materials changed little.
Auto assemblies rose 3-1/2 per cent further in October to an
annual rate of 9.4 million units. November production schedules have
been cut back from a 10.0 million unit rate to a 9.8 million rate.
Output of some household goods and most nondurable consumer goods
advanced in October and production of appliances and television sets
remained at advanced levels. Output of business equipment increased a
strong 1.6 per cent further with advances in most lines. Production of
durable goods materials was unchanged at record levels, but output of
nondurable goods materials was off slightly. For both types of materials,
output has been pressing capacity limits for several months.

Retail sales. Recent data suggest more strength in consumer
buying than had been indicated earlier. Total retail sales rose 2.1
per cent in October, according to the advance report, and sales for
August and September were revised upward.
Durable goods sales in October increased in line with the
total, largely as a result of strong sales of nonconsumer items and
miscellaneous durable goods. Nondurable goods sales rose 2.0 per
cent with sales at gasoline stations and food stores rising about 3
per cent.
With August and September figures revised upward, third
quarter sales are now estimated to be 2.8 per cent (instead of 2.2
per cent) above the second quarter. The food group, with a rise of
4.7 per cent, was the strongest of the components. In real terms,
sales edged up from the second to third quarter, but they were still
more than 2 per cent below the first quarter.

Unit sales of consumer durables. October sales of new
domestic-type autos were at an 8.7 million unit annual rate down
nearly a fifth from September and over a tenth from a year earlier.
Primarily as a result of this reduced selling rate, auto stocks at
the end of October rose to a 58 day supply, up 40 per cent from
September and up 30 per cent from a year earlier.
Preliminary estimates place foreign auto sales in October at
a 1.5 million unit rate, slightly below September and 13 per cent
below a year earlier as imports continued the steady decline from
their February peak. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the import share1973

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction activity, which was revised downward for September,
declined further in October to an annual rate of $132.9 billion. The
private residential construction sector accounted for all of the
October decline, but private nonresidential and public construction
also remained below earlier peaks.
The Census composite index of construction costs held in
October at about 153 per cent of the 1967 average, 8 per cent above a
year earlier.

Seasonally adjusted private housing starts dropped sharply
further in September to an annual rate of 1.76 million, the lowest
since February of 1971. Including upward revisions for July and
August, the third quarter average slightly exceeded a 2 million unit
annual rate; however, it was a sixth below the near-record first
quarter. For technical statistical reasons, starts may have risen in
October, but building permits and other indications point to a further
drop over the quarter as a whole.
Mobile home shipments, which also have been declining since
the first quarter, dropped sharply further in the third quarter to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 units, slightly below a
year earlier.
Completions of conventionally built homes have slowed but
some increase is indicated for the period ahead given the large backlog
of units under construction.
Vacancy rates for rental residences in the third quarter
averaged 5.8 per cent of total units available for use. While still
well below earlier highs, this rate equaled the high level of the
previous quarter as well as of the third quarter of 1972. Vacancy
rates for home-owner properties, moreover, increased to an average of
1.1 per cent in the third quarter--the highest since 1970. The increase
was particularly marked in the West.

Anticipated plant and equipment spending. In the fall survey
of 1974 capital spending intentions, McGraw-Hill found that businesses
plan to spend 14 per cent more than in 1973. Manufacturers reported
a prospective gain of 24 per cent, whereas non-manufacturing industries
planned a 7 per cent increase. Within manufacturing, exceptional
strength (expected annual gains of 35 per cent or greater) was re-
ported for iron and steel, nonferrous metals, nonelectrical machinery,
paper, and stone, and clay and glass.

Manufacturers orders and shipments. New orders for
durable goods declined 1,4 per cent in September (p), following no
change in August and a 0.7 per cent drop in July. Excluding defense,
new orders were off almost one per cent in September but nondefense
capital goods orders rose 0.6 per cent. Orders at blast furnaces and
steel mills were down sharply--reflecting in part capacity problems.
For the third quarter as a whole, new orders for durable
goods were only slightly above the second quarter level, according
to the preliminary estimate; excluding defense the rise was a bit
more. The rise of 1.8 per cent in nondefense capital goods orders
was considerably slower than the gains of about 6 per cent reported
in the first and second quarters.
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose at a 7.3 per cent
annual rate in the third quarter--off somewhat from the 11 per cent
rate of the second quarter. In the third quarter, unfilled orders
were about one-third higher than in the third quarter of 1972 and
44 per cent above their level in the fourth quarter of 1970 (the
cyclical trough). Backlogs are particularly high in blast furnaces
and steel mills, motor vehicles and parts and for nondefense capital
goods.
Shipments of durable goods were up 0.9 per cent in September
following a 2.8 per cent drop in August, Backlogs of unfilled orders
continued to increase rapidly.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturing and trade inventories
rose at a $15 billion annual rate in September (p), down rather sharply
from May-August rates. For the third quarter as a whole, the rate was
$18.6 billion, more than $4 billion below the second quarter--reflecting
in part a slower rate of increase in prices. On a GNP basis, the rate of
accumulation in the third quarter may be about the same as in the second
quarter.
Book value of manufacturers' inventories rose at an annual
rate of $10.6 billion in September (p)--off a bit from the August
rate. By stage of fabrication, inventories of materials and supplies
and of work in process were down sharply from August rates while stocks
of finished goods rose after declining in August. Wholesale trade
inventories increased at an annual rate of $3.9 billion in September (p).
Retail trade inventories showed almost no change between August and
September (p) as auto inventories declined sharply and growth in nondurable
stocks slowed appreciably.

Of the eight leading series available, series increasing

declining included new orders for durable goods, contracts and orders
for plant and equipment, housing permits, the ratio of price to unit
labor cost in manufacturing and industrial materials prices.
In October, stock prices increased while the average workweek
in manufacturing declined.

Labor market. The labor market has shown increased strength
in recent months--employment has been expanding at a rapid rate and
unemployment is down. Along with employment, the labor force has grown
rapidly, with about three-fourths of the increase among those seeking
full-time jobs. The October drop of 0.3 percentage points in unemploy-
ment brought the rate to 4-1/2 per cent for the first time since the
spring of 1970. The decline was concentrated among teenagers and young
adults (20-24 years old). Unemployment rates for adults 25 and over and
for most experienced worker categories, however, have been on a plateau
for several months; although down from a year ago, they still remain
above the 1966 to 1969 average.

Earnings. Wages are still moving up at a rapid pace. The
index of average hourly earnings for the private nonfarm economy rose at
a 6.1 per cent annual rate in October, and at a 7.4 per cent rate since
March. An acceleration of wage rate increases has been evident in most
industries since the first quarter. However, real spendable earnings
have been declining; they were about unchanged in September (the latest
month for which consumer price data are available) and down at a 2 per
cent rate from March.

Productivity and costs. Output per manhour in the private
nonfarm sector rose by 1.9 per cent (annual rate) in the third quarter,
according to preliminary figures, compared with no change in the pre-
ceding quarter.
Compensation per manhour increased at a faster rate in the
third quarter, rising at a 7.9 per cent annual rate, with an increase
of over 9 per cent in the manufacturing sector. Since hourly compensa-
tion was up considerably more than productivity, unit labor costs rose
rapidly--6.7 per cent in the private economy and 5.9 per cent in the
nonfarm sector. This is the third consecutive quarter of substantial
unit labor cost increases--an average of 5.8 per cent (annual rate) for
private nonfarm since the start of the year, compared with a rise of under
3 per cent during 1972.

I -26
Consumer prices. The rise in consumer prices slowed in
September to an annual rate of about 4 per cent, seasonally adjusted,
as food prices retreated somewhat from their very advanced August levels.
As in August, prices were about 7-1/2 per cent above the same month a
year earlier. Nonfood commodity prices, little affected as yet by
upward price readjustments permitted by Phase IV, were up at only a one
per cent rate, but the rise in service costs accelerated markedly.

Prices of fresh vegetables and poultry dropped sharply and
declines for pork and eggs also helped to more than offset the effect
of other large increases, particularly for cereal and bakery products,
dairy products and restaurant meals and snacks. Since the early-
September pricing dates for food in the CPI, prices at wholesale of
pork, broilers and eggs have declined further. However, their effect
on retail food prices in the next month or two may be offset by the
substantial increases posted at wholesale in October for fresh and
processed fruits and vergetables, fats and oils, and dairy, cereal and
bakery products.
Consumers have benefited relatively little from sharp drops
in farm prices since August. Price increases authorized after the relaxa-
tion of controls, combined with the reversal in farm prices, appear to
have widened considerably the "spread" between the retail cost and the
farm value of the USDA's market basket, according to preliminary esti-
mates (confidential for October). This spread--which covers all non-
farm costs as well as profit margins of processors and distributors--
has increased about 15 per cent since the first quarter of this year,
suggesting that any overall squeeze on profits from rising costs has
probably been eliminated.

The spread for meats (over one-fifth of the total) appears
particularly high, especially on beef. Retailers may anticipate a
rebound in wholesale beef prices, and thus be slow to adjust their
prices down in line with recent declines. In the case of pork, the
spread had been depressed since last year, but it was high for beef
during most of this and last year. If the spread on beef were at 1972
levels, retail prices would have been over 10 cents less in September,
and near 15 cents less in October.
A temporary drop in gasoline prices helped to offset increases
for other nonfood commodities, particularly household durables. However,
substantial advances have since been authorized for gasoline, starting
in late September, and COLC regulations permit cent-for-cent pass-through
of the large recent and expected further increases in crude oil and
refined petroleum product prices. Retail prices in coming months will
also reflect the large wholesale advances in October for apparel and
other textile products, furniture and tires. However, the delay in
authorizing automobile price increases should result in a seasonally
adjusted decline in October for new cars, as in the WPI.
The near-12 per cent rate of rise for services reflects the
influence of sharply rising mortgage costs. However, the index exclud-
ing these costs also rose faster than in previous months.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices declined between September
and October at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.5 per cent as
prices of farm and food products dropped sharply for the second consec-
utive month and more than offset widespread price increases for indus-
trial commodities.

Prices of farm and food products fell at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 32.8 per cent (monthly decline of 3.3 per cent) as prices
of livestock, meat, and poultry declined markedly. Sharply lower prices
for soybeans were also reported and were a major factor in the decline
in both the farm and food price index and the overall WPI. However,
prices of a number of agriculturally-based commodities increased,
including those for potatoes, processed fruits and vegetables, milk,
eggs, sugar, and vegetable oils.

I -30
The October index of prices of industrial commodities rose at
an annual rate of 14.6 per cent (monthly increase of 1.1 per cent).
Major influences in the rise were increases for refined petroleum
products, metals and metal products, textile products and apparel,
chemicals and allied products, and paper and paper products. Although
prices of passenger cars rose in October, the increase was less than
expected seasonally and this was the chief factor in the decline in
the index of consumer durables.
Higher prices for fuels had a major impact on the WPI for
October as increased prices of gasoline and fuel oil boosted the index
of refined petroleum products to a level about 40 per cent above a year
earlier. Prices of crude petroleum although unchanged in the October
WPI, were about a sixth above a year earlier.
Recently, further increases for refined petroleum products
were announced by some major producers with advances ranging from about
1 to 4 cents a gallon for gasoline and 2 to 3 cents for fuel oil.
Additional increases are expected as most observers expect domestic
prices of crude oil to rise substantially further. The WPI for October
did not reflect the above-ceiling prices permitted by the Cost-of-Living
Council on some crude oil. That is, as an incentive to increase
production, companies which produce crude oil in excess of last year's
production may sell such "new" crude oil at above-ceiling prices.
They may also sell at above-ceiling prices an additional amount of
crude oil equal to the "new" production.

Agriculture. Prices received by farmers fell 4 per cent in
the month ending October 15, for a total decline of 11 per cent since
the mid-August peak. The average, however, was still 42 per cent above
a year ago. Cattle, broiler, and egg prices continued downward through
early November but wheat, corn, and soybean prices firmed.
Clear harvesting weather and expected good yields per acre
were responsible for the earlier weakness in crop prices. Wheat, corn,
and soybean crops are expected to be 12, 2 and 23 per cent larger,
respectively, than in 1972. But usage will increase and wheat stocks
may fall to the lowest level since 1947.
Livestock prices fell in response to larger marketings as
October red meat and poultry production rose 6 per cent from September.
Larger broiler marketings appear sustainable through winter since egg

I -32
settings are up. But numbers and weights of cattle on feed indicates
that the current bulge in marketings is a result of previous withholding
and that slaughter will drop by early next year.
Since July, pork production has been about 10 per cent
below 1972 levels and farmers indicate no plans for expansion despite
profitable feeding margins. Hog raisers who grow corn apparently
intend to sell their grain at high prices rather than enlarge their
feeding operations.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
A marked turnaround in short-term interest rates occurred
late in October as market participants abandoned the view that the
Federal funds rate would continue to decline. Most private short-term
rates have increased 1/2 to 1 percentage point, but at current levels
remain well below the highs reached in mid-September. Shorter-term
Treasury bill rates, however, have risen considerably more than other
rates. The bill market has been subject to special pressures arising
from sales or redemptions of U.S. Government securities by foreign
central banks resulting from movements of funds out of foreign curren-
cies into dollars. The total volume of foreign central bank sales and
redemptions has amounted to nearly $3 billion over the past three weeks,
and to replace part of these funds the Treasury issued a $1.1 billion
bill strip early this month.
In bond markets, interest rates have moved up somewhat under
the pressure of rising short-term rates and increased supplies of bonds.
The volume of new publicly offered corporate bonds rose in October to
about twice the average volume of the earlier months of 1973, and the
higher pace of new offerings continued into November. State and local
government bond issues also rose in October, although by a much smaller
amount than in the corporate market, while the Treasury issued $300
million of a 20-year bond and $2 billion of a 6-year note as part of
its November refunding.
Bank loan growth in October fell far short of the pace re-
corded earlier in the year, as business loans showed no net expansion.
With business loans weak, inflows of demand deposits and consumer-type

II -2
time deposits strengthened, and costs of CD's augmented by the September
increase in marginal reserve requirements, banks allowed large CD's to
run off in volume and reduced their reliance on nondeposit sources of
funds. However, this decline in bank demands on short-term markets was
replaced by sharply increased business borrowing in the commercial
paper market. The combined growth in business borrowing from banks
and the commercial paper market in October was about as rapid as the
average for the first 9 months of the year.
Savings and loan associations experienced a considerable
inflow of funds in October and cut back their borrowings from the FHLBB.
Mutual savings banks, on the other hand, experienced further outflows
of deposits, although fragmentary data indicate small inflows for early
November. With the improved flow of deposits at S&L's, average rates
on new mortgage commitments in the primary and secondary markets have
declined somewhat in recent weeks.
Outlook. Interest rates in private markets are likely to be
under upward pressure between now and year-end reflecting seasonal
pressures on short-term markets and the prospective strong demands in
capital markets. The energy crisis and the potential for further large
reflows of funds from abroad make the overall interest rate outlook
more than usually uncertain. Under these circumstances, any significant
rise in the Federal funds rate is likely to accentuate upward adjustment
in interest rates generally.
The Treasury may have to raise $2-1/2--$4 billion of new cash
in early December (assuming enactment of debt ceiling legislation).
The high end of this range would help provide some cash balance cushion

II -3
to meet further redemptions of special issues by foreign official insti-
tutions.
Borrowing by Federal agencies is expected to moderate if
interest rates do not move sharply higher, in view of the sizable
amount of liquidity already built up by these agencies. But S&L's will
be especially vulnerable in the year-end reinvestment period and in
early 1974 because of a bunching of certificate maturities, and saving
outflows could be quite large especially if interest rates rose sub-
stantially. In that event, S&L's probably would step up their borrowing
from FHL Banks, and this would generate additional market borrowing
demands by the latter.
Even if market rates did not rise significantly further, the
recent decline in mortgage rates is not likely to be extended, given the
most recent upturn in short-term rates. Any further significant tight-
ening of the money market would likely lead to a renewed rise in mort-
gage rates.
Credit demands by the business sector are likely to continue
at advanced rates, given projected investment expenditures and avail-
ability of internal funds. Demands on capital markets are expected to
remain large, adjusting for seasonal slack around year-end, but signi-
ficantly higher long-term rates and lower equity prices would lead
some firms to shift demands to short-term markets. Even without this
prospect, banks will likely face increased credit demands by businesses
because of the recent and prospective rise in the commercial paper rate
relative to the prime rate. As a result, banks can be expected to re-
sume issuance of large CD's to supplement other deposit sources of funds.

II -4
Monetary aggregates. Growth in the monetary aggregates
picked up in October. After two months of decline, preliminary data
indicate that M1 expanded at a 4.6 per cent seasonally adjusted annual
rate in October, probably reflecting the effect on money demand of the
continuing strong expansion in nominal GNP. October inflows of consumer-
type time deposits also were more rapid at both commercial banks and
nonbank thrift institutions, contributing to faster growth in
M2 and M3.
Some of the October increase in consumer-type interest
bearing deposits at both banks and thrift institutions probably reflected
a shift to deposits from market securities, as yields on debt instruments
declined and stock prices fell. At large commercial banks, the growth
in consumer-type time deposits was accounted for entirely by the
four-year deposits on which the new 7.25 per cent rate ceiling did
not become effective until November 1.
With other deposit inflows strong, loan demands moderating,
and CD costs higher as a result of the September increase in marginal
reserve requirements, banks allowed their outstanding CD's to decline
by $3.4 billion in October, and the decline continued in early
November. Along with the runoff of CD's, banks also reduced their
borrowings in Euro-dollar and commercial paper markets.
The sharp decline in CD's and nondeposit sources of funds in
October offset in large part the increased inflows of other deposits.
Consequently, total inflows of bank funds, as measured by the daily
average member bank credit proxy, increased at only a 2.2 per cent
annual rate in October, the slowest pace since May of 1970.

Bank credit. Total credit at all commercial banks (last
Wednesday of the month series, seasonally adjusted) also increased at
a modest pace in October--an annual rate of 6.6 per cent. This rise
was slightly faster than in September, reflecting a sizeable increase
in bank holdings of securities other than U.S. governments--primarily
Federal agency issues. However, banks continued to liquidate Treasury
securities, and growth in total loans, which had moderated noticeably
in September, slackened further in October. Almost all categories of
loans showed some slowing, but business loans were especially weak,
not increasing at all from the end of September to the end of October,
on a seasonally adjusted basis.

While some of the moderation in bank loan expansion may
reflect more restrictive bank lending policies,1/ the recent weakness
in business borrowing from commercial banks since mid-August appears
to be associated primarily with the relatively high cost of bank loans.
Although banks lowered their prime rate in October from 10 to 9.75 per
cent (and to 9.50 per cent at a few banks), commercial paper rates fell
more than 150 basis points to around 8-1/2 per cent on dealer-placed
paper late in the month. As a result, many business firms shifted
their credit demands from banks to the commercial paper market, reversing
the shift from commercial paper to bank financing that had prevailed
earlier in the year, when commercial paper rates had exceeded the bank
prime rate. Indicative of the continued strength of credit demands,
total short-term business credit, as measured by the sum of bank
loans plus dealer-placed commercial paper, increased at a 19.5 per
cent annual rate in October--about equal to the average for the first
9 months of the year.
Consumer credit expansion at banks slowed in both September
and October, probably reflecting in part the recent weakness in sales
of new model automobiles. Growth in real estate loans also moderated
further from the rapid pace earlier in the year. In addition, there
was a large decline in loans to nonbank financial institutions as both
finance companies and other nonbank financial institutions reduced
their borrowings. The reduction in finance company borrowing
apparently reflects mainly the recent substantial volume of financing
by these companies in the capital markets.
1/ A detailed discussion of bank loan commitments is presented in the
Greenbook Supplement.

Nonbank financial institutions. According to estimates by
the FHLBB, S&L's experienced a deposit inflow in October of about $1 bil-
lion, in marked contrast to outflows of $1.2 billion and $250 million
in August and September, respectively. The annual rate of expansion
in October was about 9.0 per cent, seasonally adjusted.
Mutual savings banks apparently had a moderate outflow
during the month. After seasonal adjustment, the growth rate is estimated
at about 1.5 per cent--slightly lower than in September. The bulk of
the outflow occurred early in the month at large New York City
institutions, and coincided with increased investor interest in equity
markets as well as with a sizeable volume of funds collected for
Israel. Reports from a sample of large NYC MSB's indicate a moderate
inflow in the first five days of November.
Reflecting the improved deposit performance at S&L's,
FHLB advances during October totaled $490 million--down from
$785 million in September and $1.1 billion in August. In early
November, outstanding advances increased little. Under the new
FHLBB $2.5 billion forward commitment program, whereby member S&L's
obtain commitments to be taken down 6 months to 1 year later, the
FHLBB had issued $1.5 billion of commitments and received applications
for an additional $160 million as of early November. Despite the
8-1/2 per cent rate on the loans to be made under the commitments,
member S&L's appear to find them an attractive hedge against possible
further deposit outflows given the low (1/4 per cent) commitment fee
and prevailing rates on mortgage loans.

II -10
Policy loan activity at life insurance companies in September
remained near the record high level of August. At 15 large companies
holding 64 per cent of all policy loans outstanding, the September net
increase was $219 million. Scattered reports from individual life
companies indicate that demands for policy loans moderated in October,
although recent increases in market rates of interest could generate
a pick-up in such loans. Nevertheless, available information suggests
that life companies continued to have a relatively comfortable liquidity
position.

Consumer credit. Growth in total consumer credit outstanding
dropped sharply to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $14.8 billion
in September, following four months of growth at rates in excess of $24
billion. Instalment credit outstanding advanced $16.3 billion in
September, SAAR, compared with $22.7 billion in August.
The major factor in the slackened rate of instalment credit
growth was a decline in the rate of credit extensions for automobiles
and other consumer goods. The decline in extensions was particularly
pronounced for retail outlets and bank credit cards.
New car interest rates, which remained relatively stable
during the first half of the year and advanced only modestly during
July and August, rose more sharply in September. During September,
rates rose 19 basis points on direct loans at commercial banks and
15 basis points on purchased loans at finance companies. Following
the advance, both rates were roughly 40 basis points above year-earlier
levels.
Commercial paper outstanding. In October, commercial paper
outstanding expanded an estimated $2.4 billion on a seasonally adjusted
basis. This matched the largest monthly increase on record, and was
attributable to a surge in dealer placed paper reflecting the reduced
cost of paper issuance in relation to borrowing at banks. At the end
of October, outstanding dealer placed paper was only marginally below
the level reached at the end of 1972, just before businesses began
switching in volume from commercial paper to bank credit.
Nonbank directly placed paper increased an estimated $200
million in October. The raising of funds through long-term debt and
the slower pace of retail automotive sales apparently reduced short-term

II -12
funds requirements of some large finance companies. Bank-related com-
mercial paper dropped an estimated $400 million--the first decline in
this category in a year.

Short-term rates. Following the last Committee meeting,
short-term interest rates declined substantially further; but, since
late October, they have turned up sharply, particularly on U.S.
Treasury bills. The recent advance has carried bill yields substan-
tially above levels prevailing at the time of the Committee meeting,
as the table shows, and erased most or all of the post-meeting reduc-
tions in other short-term rates.

Perhaps the most important factor contributing to the recent
turnaround in rates was a shift in market expectations as to the future
course of monetary policy. From mid-September through late October, a
consensus among market participants was that Federal Reserve policy was
likely to move persistently in the direction of ease in future months,
and this provided much of the impetus for the sharp fall in rates over
that period. But, as the Federal funds rate showed no tendency to
drop significantly below 10 per cent from early October on and emerging
data indicated a substantial pickup in growth of the aggregates, the
market lost its conviction as to the likelihood that monetary policy
would shift further in the direction of ease, at least over the near-
term future,
In the Treasury bill market, rate changes prompted by the
shift in underlying market expectations were strongly accentuated when
foreign central banks liquidated Treasury security holdings in volume
to obtain needed dollar exchange. Since the last week in October,
foreign central banks have sold about $1.0 billion of bills directly
in the market or to the Federal Reserve and also have redeemed about
$1.9 billion of special issues. In addition to the direct impact of
these sales on the market supply of bills, the redemptions of special
issues required the Treasury unexpectedly to seek new funds in the market
in early November and increased the possibility of market borrowing in
coming months. So far this additional borrowing has taken the form of
a $1.1 billion auction of a bill strip on November 9 and the addition
of $100 million to the weekly auction on November 12.
Looking ahead, the Treasury will have to raise new cash in
early December. The size of the offering is in some doubt and will

II -15
depend on the extent of cash loss from redemptions of Treasury specials
by foreigners and on the availability of borrowing authority from the
Federal Reserve (currently lapsed). At the moment it would appear that
borrowing would be in the $2.5 to $4.0 billion range, and possibly
would take the form of tax bills.
In the Agency market, the Federal Home Loan Banks have a
reduced need to borrow because inflows into savings and loan associa-
tions have been better than expected. As a result, it presently
appears that Agency borrowing during November and December may amount
to about $1.8 billion, rather than the $2.9 billion projected earlier.
With the recent backup in rates, however, the outlook for Agency
borrowing is more uncertain than usual.
Treasury coupon market. Yields on Treasury coupon issues also
have risen significantly since early October, offsetting about one-
third to two-fifths of the reductions recorded in most maturity areas
over August and September. The backup reflected, in part, the sharp
rise in short-term rates, a build-up in the calendar of new issues
scheduled to be sold in related markets, and the impact of the recent
Treasury refunding which was accentuated when the offering of strip
bills was announced before dealers had made much progress in distribution
issues required in the refunding.

In its November refunding operation, the Treasury sold
$3.8 billion of securities. These included $1.5 billion of 25-month
notes and $2 billion of 6-year notes, both with a 7 per cent coupon,
auctioned at average yields of 6.91 per cent and 6.82 per cent, respec-
tively. Also, $300 million of a reopened 20-year bond carrying a 7-1/2
per cent coupon--first auctioned last August--were sold in a Dutch
auction at an issuing yield of 7.35 per cent. Yields on the two notes
have since moved up significantly in when-issued trading, while the
current yield on the bond remains at about its auction average.
Dealers took large positions of about $1.2 billion in
these issues, but sizable sales to the public have enabled them to
reduce their holdings. As of November 12, dealer net positions in
all coupon issues maturing in more than a year were down to about $650
million.

II -17
Long-term security markets. The bond market rally that
began early in August faded in early October. Since then long-term
rates have risen somewhat, although they are still about 30 to 50 basis
points below their August peaks. The rise apparently reflected a
relatively heavy volume of current and prospective new issues, and un-
certainty about the strength of the economy and the future course of
monetary policy, which previously had been interpreted as easing.

Stock prices declined appreciably from late October into early
November apparently reflecting investor concern about rising interest
rates, the energy crisis, and domestic and international political un-
certainties. The decline erased about one-half of the gains recorded
during the rally throughout most of September and early October. Price-
earnings ratios remain historically low; for example, based on third
quarter earnings the ratio for the Dow-Jones industrial average is
presently about 12, in contrast to a long-term average around 17. 1/
Continued sizable additions to the calendar of corporate
security offerings have resulted in upward revisions in the already
large volume of offerings forecast in the October Greenbook, Corporate
public bond offerings in October are now estimated to have totalled
$1.7 billion and the November forecast is $1.9 billion, about twice
the average monthly volume during the first three quarters of 1973.
In December, corporate public bond offerings are expected to decline
from these levels, mainly for seasonal reasons. Stock offerings in
November also are projected to be somewhat higher than earlier forecasts,
bolstered by the announcement of a $500 million preferred offering by
A.T.& T.
The increased corporate security financing reflects large
capital expenditure plans, the desire to fund short-term debt, and a
general view that long-term rates probably will not fall much further
in the immediate future. However, corporate demands for capital market
financing appear especially volatile since corporations still have con-
siderable financial flexibility and could easily postpone financing if
rates rose to levels that appeared unattractive.
1/ Preliminary national income estimates of third quarter profits for all
non-financial corporations indicate little change from the second
quarter. The Greenbook Supplement will provide an analysis of profit
developments in the third quarter.

Long-term unicipal financing in October is estimated at $2.2
billion, about $.2 billion higher than expected earlier. Most of this
increase consists of industrial revenue bonds and other types of
special revenue bond issues. Looking ahead, State and local financing
is expected to return to a level more in line with that in the first
nine months of 1973-about $1.75 billion in November and a seasonal
drop to $1.35 billion in December.

II -20
Mortgage market. Preliminary data suggest that the volume of
new mortgage commitments at savings and loan associations in October
rose somewhat above the sharply reduced September level. The backlog
of outstanding mortgage commitments remained little changed, however,
at about 23 per cent below the February high.
In the primary market the decline in average contract interest
rates on new commitments for 80 per cent conventional home loans which
began in early October slackened considerably in early November,
judging from the weekly FHLMC survey of 120 S&L's. On November 9 the
rate was 8.59 per cent--26 basis points below the late September peak.
With yields on new issues of high-grade corporate bonds up appreciably
over this period, the spread favoring such mortgages declined 44 points.
Secondary market yields on 8-1/2 per cent FHA/VA mortgages
also have declined, primarily because originations of such mortgages
have been limited and pressure on mortgage companies to complete their
mortgage pools in time to meet earlier commitments for GNMA-guaranteed
securities has increased. Partly reflecting these developments, offerings
to FNMA in each of the October auctions for short-term commitments to
purchase Government-underwritten home mortgages were relatively limited.
Net expansion of total mortgage debt in the third quarter
dipped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $70 billion--down $7
billion from the peak in the first half of 1973. This decline was due
largely to slower growth in the residential sector, even though

II -21
advances to S&L's from the Federal Home Loan Banks were in record
volume and Federal agencies operating in the secondary market stepped
up their purchases of residential mortgages. Altogether, if GNMA pass-
throughs and net FHLB advances are included, Federal agencies accounted
for almost half of the net change in outstanding residential debt
during the quarter.

Agricultural finance. Demand for farm loans remained strong
through the third quarter. In September, for instance, outstanding
loans at production credit associations rose contraseasonally, as they
also had in August. In both months, new loans exceeded collections,
which also is unusual at that time of the year. Higher production
expenses basically explain the strong credit demand, along with such
contributing factors as a sharply reduced level of pre-harvest
Government farm program payments, a continued large volume of farm
equipment purchases, the withholding of cattle from market during the
price freeze, and the postponement of grain marketing for several
reasons--price anticipations, transportation difficulties, and to
minimize income taxes.

However, October 1 surveys of rural banks in the Seventh
and Ninth Federal Reserve Districts indicate that farm loan demand may
be easing in the fourth quarter; in fact, the proportion of bankers
expecting reduced demand for farm production loans set a record high

II -23
in both quarterly surveys. Clearly, bankers expect significant farm
loan repayments to result from this fall's extraordinary net farm
income. As a partial offset, demand for grain storage and farm
equipment loans will remain at high levels.
Fewer loan renewals and large post-harvest deposit gains
should combine to produce a more liquid position at many rural banks
this winter. But during the third quarter, the availability of loan
funds at some rural banks deteriorated. On the October 1 Survey date,
for instance, fewer Ninth District banks were actively seeking new
loan accounts than three months earlier, and more had refused loan
requests because of a shortage of funds. In the Seventh District, an
increased number of banks regarded their loan/deposit ratios as too
high. Such series reflecting credit availability, however, were still
far from the levels they exhibited in 1970.
During the third quarter, interest rates rose sharply at
all major farm lender groups. In contrast, during the first half of
the year, rates had increased significantly only at lenders with
close ties to short-term money markets--the production credit
associations and the larger banks--while rising only slightly at rural
banks and remaining unchanged at the Federal Land Banks.

Federal finance. With fiscal 1974 budget outlays now forecast
at $272.0 billion and receipts at $269.0 billion, our estimate of the
deficit for the current fiscal year has grown to $3.0 billion. This
compares with revised Administration figures of $270.6 billion for budget
outlays and $270.0 billion for budget receipts.*
Federal outlays so far this fiscal year have been lower than
projected, especially for grants-in-aid. Nonetheless, our fiscal 1974
outlays forecast has been raised $0.7 billion since the October Green-
book, for two principal reasons. The first is that we project a "catch-up"
in grants-in-aid later this fiscal year as a result of recent court
decisions that may require the release of a large amount of impounded
funds. The second is the President's request for supplemental
appropriations for defense to replace equipment going to Israel.
We have estimated this program to cost $.4 billion in fiscal 1974
and $1.5 billion for calendar 1974.
In contrast with official forecasts of a 5.9 per cent social
security benefit increase in July 1974, the staff projection calls
for a 5.9 per cent increase in January 1974. While our estimate is
close to the amount enacted by the Senate, the increase that is finally
enacted might be somewhat larger. The House Ways and Means Committee
has approved a 7 per cent benefit increase payable in April 1974, with
a further 4 per cent increase to follow in July.
* The "Administration" figure of $270.6 billion for outlays is not
an official published figure but rather is the sum of the official
$270.0 billion estimate of October 18 and the Budget Scorekeeping
estimate of $.6 billion for Mid-East related defense expenditures.

II -26
Our fiscal 1974 receipts forecast has been reduced $.6 billion
since the October Greenbook due entirely to revised income assumptions.
However, withheld taxes in recent months have been lower than
projected, possibly indicating that an adjustment to over-withholding
finally may be materializing, that is, that wage earners are increasing
their claimed exemptions. Another uncertainty arises from the House
Ways and Means Committee's social security bill that includes a larger
wage base increase than currently scheduled and, if passed, could
significantly raise receipts in the second half of calendar 1974.
As yet, however, we have not responded to these developments in
our forecasts.
The Senate Finance Committee now has the House-enacted bill
raising the Federal debt ceiling to $475.7 billion. This amount is
$4.3 billion below the Administration's request. Nonetheless, staff
estimates indicate that it should be sufficient to finance Treasury
operations through fiscal 1974.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and Outlook. Preliminary data (to be released on
November 15) show a dramatic improvement in the U.S. balance of pay-
ments during the third quarter. There was an official settlements
surplus for the quarter of $8.6 billion (seasonally adjusted annual
rate), following a surplus of $1.4 billion in the second quarter, and
in August and September the dollar appreciated on average against
other major currencies, reversing most of the July depreciation.
Another large official settlements surplus developed in mid-October,
cumulating to nearly $2.0 billion by November 7, and the dollar has
appreciated sharply further in recent weeks, to about its May level.
The data now available indicate that the third-quarter
improvement occurred in the components of the basic balance -- the
current account and long-term capital flows. Both the trade balance
and the balance on long-term private capital shifted from second-
quarter deficits to substantial surpluses.
It is likely that the basic balance will continue to be in
surplus, but unlikely that the rate of surplus will remain so high as
in the third quarter. Net purchases of U.S, stocks by foreigners
reached an annual rate of $3.5 billion in the third quarter, but
October inflows are expected to be down very sharply. The balance on
other long-term private capital flows will probably also turn less
favorable than the unusually high third-quarter net inflow. Further

III -2
increases in the merchandise trade surplus, while not unlikely, would
have to be substantial to offset the probable decline in the surplus
on long-term capital flows.
The Arab cutback in oil production, if sustained, would
have a lesser impact in the United States than in countries
heavily dependent on oil imports for industrial uses, including Japan
and a number of European countries. The rapid rise in the price of
oil implies a larger oil import bill for this and other countries,
in spite of the production cutbacks, but a substantial portion of the
increased earnings of the oil producers will probably be spent or
invested in this country, either directly or indirectly. Considerations
such as these, together with the large September trade surplus, have
brought the dollar under strong upward pressure against other major
currencies in recent weeks.
Most major foreign countries are continuing on a course of
monetary restraint, with high or rising interest rates, and with sharp
drops in the growth of national money stocks (M1) shown by the data
through September. Following the announcement of a sharp deterioration
in the trade balance of the United Kingdom for September, on November 13
the Bank of England raised its minimum lending rate by 1-3/4 percentage
points to a record 13 percent and issued a call for additional special
deposits by the banking system equal to 2 percent of liabilities.

III -3
Foreign exchange markets. The major development in the exchange
markets in recent weeks has been, of course, the explosion of demand for
dollars against European and Japanese currencies consequent upon the release
of U.S. trade figures for September, showing a whopping surplus, and the
subsequent evolution of the oil crisis. The dollar has risen, in a little
over two weeks, by 6 to 9 per cent against the European snake currencies,
5 per cent against the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, and lesser amounts
against Sterling, the lira, and the Canadian dollar. Only massive amounts
of dollar intervention by the Bank of Japan prevented the appreciation against
the yen from being substantially greater.
While a substantial part of the dollar's appreciation followed
directly upon the release of the trade figures, much the larger part of
the rise was, seemingly, associated with the subsequent development of
the oil crisis, which was interpreted by the market to portend a worsening
of European and Japanese industrial capabilities and balances of payments
relative to those of the United States. While the System took the opportunity
of the favorable market reaction to the U.S. trade figures to clean up its
outstanding swap debt in marks, and Germany simultaneously sold dollars
it had purchased in September, during the past week or so, despite often
hectic activity in the markets, there was only token central bank inter-
vention in European currencies. As the dollar moved up against the snake,
the various currencies in the snake changed positions, but no significant
strains on the band developed. The mark, which together with the guilder
suffered the largest losses against the dollar, moved to the bottom of the
snake, but the Bundesbank sold only nominal amounts of Danish kroner, the
currency at the top.

III -4
In contrast to European central banks, the Bank of Japan inter-
vened massively to supply dollars to the market. From October 26 to
November 14, the Bank of Japan sold $1.9 billion. The market seemed to
expect that Japan's balance of payments would be the hardest hit of any
major country by the recent oil price hikes and its economy most affected
by an oil production cutback. The Japanese authorities took some adminis-
trative actions on November 13 to curb the demand for dollars, but these
actions would appear unlikely to have significant impact.
Sterling declined against the dollar by the smallest amount,
2 per cent, of any of the European currencies. On November 13, however,
the U.K. released trade figures for October, showing a record monthly
trade deficit of £298 million. Simultaneously with release of the trade
figures, and partly to blunt the expected market reaction to those figures,
the U.K. announced a 1-3/4 per cent increase (to 13 per cent) in the Bank
of England's minimum lending rate and issued a call for additional special
deposits (cash reserves) of the banking system equal to 2 per cent of
liabilities. The U.K. also declared a national state of emergency over
the oil crisis. In response to this variety of actions, exchange market
activity wound down abruptly, and the dollar's rise against sterling came
to an, at least temporary, halt.
In the gold market, prices tended to decline with the strength-
ening of the dollar and the apparent success of the Mid-East cease fire.
By November 13 the price had fallen to $96.75. On November 14, in response
to the announcement of the ending of the March, 1968 gold agreement, which
had prohibited signatory central banks from selling gold on the private
market, the gold price plunged to $90.00 in rather heavy trading.

III -5
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates have shown net
declines over the past four weeks. Changes in Euro-dollar rates over
this period have generally followed, both in timing and magnitude, changes
in U.S. money market rates, declining throughout October then firming slightly
in early November. The surge in demand for dollars which developed on
exchange markets at the end of October has had little impact on Euro-dollar
rates. This shift in demand has been reflected, however, in decreased forward
premiums or increased forward discounts on major foreign currencies and
increased Euro-currency interest rates on these currencies.
The overnight Euro-dollar rate averaged nearly 9-1/2 per cent
in the week ended November 14, a decrease of 1/4 percentage point from
the week of October 17. The average Federal funds rate also declined by
1/4 percentage point over this period and remained approximately 1/3 per-
centage point above the overnight Euro-dollar rate. In contrast, overnight
Euro-dollar borrowing subject to the 8 per cent marginal reserve require-
ment has remained more expensive than borrowing in the Federal funds market
throughout the period. Three-month Euro-deposits were bid at an average
rate of 9.6 per cent in the week ended November 14, down from the 10 per
cent level of four weeks previous. The three-month CD rate has remained
below the three-month Euro-dollar rate by over 1/2 percentage point
throughout the period.
U.S. banks' liabilities to their foreign branches averaged
$1,893 million in the week ended November 7, a decline of $98 million
from the week of October 10. U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks
increased their foreign liabilities by slightly over $1 billion during
this same period.

U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary data show an official
settlements surplus of $0.9 billion (not seasonally adjusted) during
the third quarter, while the dollar appreciated against most other
major currencies after dropping in early July. Seasonally adjusted,
the official settlements surplus was $2.1 billion for the quarter,
following a deficit of $10.1 billion during the first half of the year.
Since mid-October the official settlements surplus has risen sharply
as countries intervened to moderate the continuing appreciation of the
dollar, which in mid-November recovered its average level for the
second quarter.
The basic balance for the third quarter may have moved into
a surplus of more than $6 billion at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate,
compared with a second-quarter deficit rate of $3 billion and a 1972
deficit of nearly $10 billion. Among major components of the basic
balance, the merchandise trade balance improved by $4 billion (annual
rate) during the third quarter, while the long-term private capital
account appears to have shifted to a substantial surplus. A very
tentative estimate shows a small increase in the surplus on military
transactions and services, but outflows of government grants and
credits, which were abnormally low in the second quarter, increased
considerably.
Incomplete data suggest that the third-quarter inflow of
foreign private long-term capital was about twice as great as the

III -8
$4.1 billion (annual rate) inflow during the second quarter. With
renewed optimism about stock prices and the value of the dollar on
the currency exchanges, foreign net purchases of U.S. stocks increased
to an annual rate of $3.5 billion, compared with $0.6 billion during
the second quarter and $2.3 billion during 1972. These net purchases
declined toward the end of the quarter, however, and appear to have
dropped sharply in October. Third-quarter data are not yet available
on foreign direct investment in the United States, but several large
acquisitions occurred that probably raised the inflow substantially
beyond the record-breaking second-quarter level of $1.8 billion
(annual rate).
Outflows for U.S. private long-term investment abroad are
estimated to have declined sharply during the third quarter. U.S.
direct investment abroad probably dropped substantially after the very
high rate of outflows in the first half of the year. In addition, banks
reduced their long-term claims on foreigners in the third quarter,
reversing outflows during the first two quarters.
Recorded flows of short-term capital showed a reduction in
bank-reported non-liquid claims on foreigners during the third quarter,
compared with large outflows in the first two quarters. Preliminary
third-quarter data also show a continued large net inflow of liquid
private capital.

III -9
U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. merchandise trade balance
for September showed a surplus of $8.9 billion (seasonally-adjusted
annual rate, balance of payments basis), raising the third quarter
trade surplus to a $3.1 billion rate, compared with a second-quarter
deficit rate of $0.9 billion and a 1972 deficit of $6.9 billion.
Improvements in U.S. bilateral trade balances from the second to the
third quarter were widely spread around the world.
Agricultural exports in the third quarter, which provided
just over one-fourth of total export sales, fell in volume by 5 percent
(net an annual rate) from their second quarter level, while increasing
in price (unit-values) by almost 20 percent. On a month-to-month
basis, the volume of agricultural exports has been declining fairly
steadily since March. Nevertheless, third-quarter volume was more than
20 percent higher this year than in 1972.
Exports of non-agricultural commodities grew in volume by
4 percent in the third quarter, while their unit values increased
by roughly 3 percent. Since third-quarter 1972, volume has grown by
23 percent and unit values have risen 10 percent.
The value of imports rose by roughly 3 percent between the
second and third quarters. On the basis of preliminary data, import
volume fell for the second quarter in a row, averaging an 11 percent
annual rate of decline since the first quarter. This decline is notable,
since it occurred at a time of fairly rapid U.S. business expansion.

III -10
Some weakness in import volumes may be due to the pressure of demand
abroad, but the cumulating effect of the increase in import prices, due
in part to the depreciation of the dollar, is also a strong influence.
During the third quarter the unit value of imports rose further by
4-1/2 percent.
Among major end-use categories of imports, both capital
goods and fuels grew in volume in the third quarter, by 10 percent and
5 percent, respectively. Imports in almost all other categories have
declined in volume for at least two successive quarters. Third-
quarter unit values were above second-quarter levels for all major
end-use categories except automotive imports from Canada and capital
goods, for which the indices declined by roughly 3 and 1 percent,
respectively.
Imports of crude petroleum and fuel oil grew in quantity
by 4-1/2 percent in the third quarter, to a level more than 40 percent
higher than in third quarter 1972. The unit value of these imports
rose in the third quarter by 10 percent, to a level nearly 25 percent
higher than in third-quarter 1972.
Unfilled export orders for durable goods (excluding motor
vehicles and aircraft) increased in September (seasonally adjusted)
for the ninth consecutive month. New export orders for these goods
(seasonally adjusted) fell sharply in September after an equally-sharp
increase in August.

III -11
Monetary Conditions and Monetary Policy in Major Industrial
Countries. Though the rapid rate of real economic growth in major in-
dustrial countries that began in 1972 and continued through early 1973
has apparently been slackening for several months, high rates of price
inflation persist. Consequently, monetary authorities almost every-
where in the industrialized world have been pursuing policies intended
to slow the growth of bank credit and money. Efforts to curb inflation
through damping aggregate demand have placed prime reliance on monetary
restraint, with the exception of Germany, where strong anti-inflationary
fiscal measures have been enacted to supplement restrictive monetary
policy.
Initiation of tight money policies generally dates back at
least to mid-1973 and, in the case of Germany and Japan, to the end of
1972. Reflecting the tightness of monetary conditions, short-term in-
terest rates rose very steeply this year, peaking in the late summer
or early fall. Long-term rates likewise climbed, though much less
sharply. In several countries, expansion of monetary aggregates--as
is illustrated by the data on M1 and M2 in Table 1--has decelerated
this year following very rapid growth in 1971 and 1972.
In some instances, efforts have been made--in Canada and
Italy, for example--not only to curtail growth of the money supply and
total credit, but to channel bank credit into certain sectors and to
smaller enterprises.

III -13
One of the consequences of the effort to control and allocate
credit has been an inversion of the normal term structure of interest
rates, as occurred in the United States. In several markets short-term
rates have been appreciably above long-term rates since mid-year.
A second consequence of rising interest rates has been the
strong growth of time deposits in several of the industrial countries.
Spiraling short-term rates have attracted substantial funds into time
and savings deposits while, as stringent credit policies take hold, the
growth of M1 has slowed drastically. In some countries, in fact, M1
has actually declined in recent months.
In Germany, the authorities have been pursuing a tight mone-
tary policy for over a year. The Bundesbank has raised its discount
rate six times, from 4 to 9 per cent, since the beginning of October
1972 and, more important, has taken a variety of steps this year to
more directly limit the banking system's capacity to expand credit.
These steps have included cuts in rediscount quotas, virtual elimina-
tion of the banks' Lombard borrowing privilege, increases in reserve
requirements on resident deposits, and reductions in the base above
which the 90 to 100 per cent reserve requirements on non-resident de-
posits apply.
The Bundesbank's most recent restrictive actions were taken
in early October, to offset the domestic impact of the heavy capital
inflows resulting from the flight from the French franc in the wake of

the guilder revaluation in mid-September. Reserve requirements on
domestic deposits were increased by 3 per cent, rediscount quotas were
cut by about 8 per cent for medium-sized banks and by 25 per cent for
large banks, and the base above which the stiff marginal reserve require-
ment on foreign deposits are imposed was lowered by 15 per cent.
The Bundesbank's restrictive measures have been reflected in
the movement of monetary aggregates this year. Bank lending to domestic
non-banks, for example, rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
about 10 per cent from the end of February through the end of August.
In the year ending in February, the increase had been 17 per cent.
There has also been a deceleration in the growth of the money supply.
The growth of 2 in the six months through September was down to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 11 per cent, compared to a
rise of 17 per cent in 1972 and of over 20 per cent in the year ending
in March. M1 has experienced a substantial net decline since March,
reflecting large-scale switching out of sight deposits into time deposits,
interest rates on which have risen very sharply. Efforts to control
the growth in the money supply have been complicated, even since the
initiation of the EC joint float in March, by heavy speculative capital
inflows, first in June--leading to the revaluation of the DM at the
end of that month--and again in September. Also contributing to the
rise in M2 has been the movement out of savings deposits into short-
term time deposits. Increases in yields on the former have failed to
keep pace with the upsurge in yields on the latter.

III -16
The Bundesbank's tight money policy has produced a general
rise in interest rates this year. Short-term rates have climbed much
more steeply than long-term yields, which are now lower than many key
short-term rates. Long-term rates have shown a softening tendency in
recent months, apparently reflecting, in part, expectations that the
authorities might ease their present restrictive policy stance. But both
the government and the monetary authorities continue to maintain that
inflationary pressures remain too strong to permit any relaxation of
restraint at this time. In contrast to several other countries, the
government has reinforced a tight-money policy with restrictive fiscal
measures, notably steps to curtail government spending and discourage
private-sector investment.
Monetary policy in France continues to tighten. The pattern
of rising discount and bank lending rates evident elsewhere was also
followed in France in recent months, though apparently with a slight
lag behind U.K. and German moves. From July to September, the Bank of
France raised the discount rate up 3-1/2 points to 11 per cent, prompting
banks to raise their base lending rates correspondingly. By September
short-term rates had edged slightly higher than long-term yields.
Recent French policy has been strongly influenced by exchange
market uncertainty which followed the September 17 revaluation of the
Dutch guilder. In early August French controls on tourist expenditures
and private transfers were relaxed, but in September measures were taken

III -17
to encourage capital inflows. Then, in contrast to its continued tightening
of general monetary policy, the Bank of France in October removed the 100
per cent marginal reserve requirement on non-resident franc accounts and
authorized resumption of interest payments on such accounts. Furthermore,
though raising reserve requirements for resident accounts from 12 to
14 per cent, the Bank of France lowered requirements for non-resident
accounts from 6 to 5 per cent.
French monetary authorities have also progressively tightened
direct quota controls to constrain the expansion of bank credit. Year-
to-year credit growth limits of 13-14 per cent are in effect for the
remainder of 1973, and are being strictly enforced. This panoply of
measures has helped to significantly reduce the growth rate of M2 this
year from the near 18 per cent levels of 1971 and 1972. M1 has been
essentially flat since May, as recent growth of the total money supply
has been concentrated in interest-bearing time deposits.
In Italy, a strong economic upswing is now in progress. Until
recently Italian authorities continued to pursue an expansionary monetary
policy to stimulate recovery from the 1970 slowdown. Until early 1973,
in fact, interest rates tended to decline, and monetary policy continued
easy. Signs of a gradual tightening first appeared in July, when inter-
bank loan rates and overdraft rates on the commercial banks began to
climb rapidly toward levels already reached elsewhere. In July overall
credit ceilings were also imposed, with strict ceilings on lending to

III -18
large borrowers from the banks and with preferences for smaller borrowers.
In mid-September the Bank of Italy raised the basic discount rate 2-1/2
points to 6-1/2 per cent, and the rates on advances also rose to 6-1/2
per cent.
In October the rediscounting of loans to smaller borrowers was
exempted from the 3 per cent penalty rates imposed by the Bank of Italy
to discourage repeated discounting.
To avoid inhibiting the recovery in productive investment,
measures have also been taken to hold down long-term rates. Italian
banks have been required to buy large quantities of securities, and long-
term rates have recently fallen below short-term levels.
Further tightening of monetary policy is possible, although
the authorities may be willing to accept higher inflation rates in Italy
than elsewhere, rather than risk inhibiting recovery when considerable
slack capacity still exists.
Money supply figures are not available beyond May. In 1971 and
1972 both M1 and M2 increased in the 18 to 19 per cent range, but after
December 1972 the growth of M1 slowed somewhat.
Monetary policy was sharply tightened in the United Kingdom
this week, with the Bank of England on November 13 raising its minimum
lending rate from 11-1/4 to 13 per cent and increasing the special de-
posits requirement from 4 to 6 per cent. The two percentage point in-
crement will be implemented through four 1/2-points rises between the

III -19
end of November and the beginning of next January. Special deposits
are interest-bearing deposits that British banks can be required to
maintain at the Bank of England. Changes in special deposit require-
ments are used to vary the required reserve rate for British banks
above their base liquid reserve requirement of 12-1/2 per cent.
The immediate causes of the Bank of England's action this
week [was] a worsening in Britain's balance of payments deficit--the
October trade deficit was the largest ever recorded--and a level of
demand for credit deemed to be excessive. Credit--along with other
monetary aggregates such as the broadly defined money supply--has in
fact been expanding at a very rapid rate this year.
The special deposits requirement had been raised earlier
this year, in July, from 3 to 4 per cent. In the same month, the Bank
of England's minimum lending rate was raised from 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 per
cent. By August the base landing rate of the clearing banks had risen
from 8 to 10 per cent. Government bond sales also helped to push up
long-term rates.
One effect of the sharp upswing in British rates was to
encourage extensive switching from sight to time deposits, and especially
to large denomination sterling CD's. Some bank customers utilized their
overdraft facilities to invest in these CD's, the effect of which was
to exaggerate the underlying growth trend in M3.

III -20
There was some easing of both short- and long-term rates in
September and October. However, the Bank of England's latest action
clearly will reverse the downward trend.
In Japan, monetary policy-which, as in most countrieshas
played the major role this year in efforts to restrain domestic demand-
has become increasingly restrictive since the end of 1972.
From January through October the authorities have slowly increased
reserve requirements on time deposits for the large banks from 0.5
to 1.75 per cent, and on sight deposits from 1.5 to 3.75 per cent,
while raising the discount rate to 7 per cent, an historically high
level for Japan. The prime and rediscount rates have climbed apace,
and in October the rate for the rediscounting of short-term bills
due after January 1, 1974, reached 9.75 per cent.
The authorities have also intensified measures introduced in
the early months of the year to restrain the growth of consumer credit
and to reduce the rate of expansion of bank credit. Quarterly ceilings
applied to the loan expansion of the city banks have been progressively
lowered through the year. This action has had the effect of reducing
the annual rate of bank credit expansion from around 25 per cent in
the last half of 1972 to about 14 per cent since May of this year.
Growth in the money supply has also slowed this year. While
M1 rose at an average annual rate of 16 per cent in the 1964-70 period,
the rise in the money supply accelerated to 30 per cent in 1971 and

III -21
declined only slightly, to 25 per cent, in 1972. This year, however,
growth slowed very substantially, and M1 actually declined from July
to August. In recent months, M2 has risen considerably faster than M1--
reflecting the interest sensitivity of Japanese funds--but the increase
in M2 has also slowed markedly.
The pace of monetary tightening in Canada has been steady
and gradual this year, following an expansionary stance which lasted
through 1971 and 1972. Beginning in April, the Bank of Canada discount
rate -which had remained at 4-3/4 per cent since October, 1971 -was
raised in a series of half-point steps to 7-1/4 per cent on September 13.
There was a concomitant rise in the chartered banks' prime lending rates,
from 6 per cent in April to S per cent in mid-September.
Canadian authorities have also encouraged the banks to avoid
discrimination against borrowers in the small business and farm sectors.
This objective is being pursued through a dual lending rate structure
set up by the chartered banks in May.
The chartered banks have raised deposit rates somewhat, in-
cluding the rates for term deposits under the "Winnipeg Agreement,"
which provides for ceiling rates on term deposits of less than one year.
As in other countries, yields on long-term bonds have increased, but
less than those for short-term instruments, and as a result, the term
structure is similar to that elsewhere.
Because of the Canadian concern with high unemployment, efforts

III -22
to slow the growth of the money supply were more cautious than those
in the European countries. As can be seen in Table 1, the growth of
Canadian M1 appears to be keeping up with increases in M2, with both
expanding at about a 15 per cent annual rate. Monetary policy might be
tightened further, but only moderately, as the rate of growth of
Canadian GNP is expected to slow somewhat next year.
