Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act.           
 
   
 
    
 
                                                            
 
1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The energy crisis has begun to have an impact on numerous
sectors of the economy. Employment cutbacks continue to be announced
by the automobile industry and by commercial airlines; prices of petroleum
and products have risen sharply; sales of large autos have fallen, and
gasoline purchases have declined.
Staff estimates now indicate an increase of $29 billion in
nominal GNP this quarter--compared with $32 billion in the last Greenbook--
and prices are increasing faster than had earlier been anticipated. Real
GNP is estimated to be increasing this quarter at an annual rate of only
2 per cent. Consumer expenditures for durable goods will be down
appreciably, with auto sales weakening. Moreover, the decline in resi-
dential construction activity apparently will be steeper than we had pro-
jected a month ago. Business outlays for fixed capital, however, are
still likely to show a sizable increase this quarter, and inventory invest-
ment is now expected to rise appreciably, in part because of the large
back-up of dealer stocks of autos.
Industrial production is now indicated to have been weaker in
recent months than originally reported. The figures for September and
October have been revised down and only a slight increase occurred in
November. The revisions reflect new information in physical quantities
and electric power, and are concentrated in business equipment and
materials. Over the past four months, industrial production has risen

I-2
only 1/2 per cent with output of business equipment--despite the downward
revision--the only major sector showing any appreciable increase.
The labor market, on the other hand, continued strong through
mid-November. Nonfarm payroll employment increased 200,000 further in
November, mostly in nonindustrial activities. The unemployment rate,
however, moved back up to 4.7 per cent, about the level that had generally
prevailed since midyear except for the 4.5 per cent October low.
Toward the end of the month, unemployment compensation claims were
beginning to rise, possibly reflecting to some extent layoffs related to
the fuel crisis.
Retail sales were virtually unchanged in November, according
to the advance report, and the increase previously reported for October
has been scaled down. Unit sales of autos stayed at about the reduced
October rate, with supplies of smaller models increasingly short relative
to demands. Sales of imported models rose in November.
Business capital spending plans have continued strong, according
to available data gathered before the heightened awareness of the energy
crisis. The latest Commerce plant and equipment survey indicates a
substantial further expansion in the first half of 1974, particularly in
manufacturing. New orders for nondefense capital goods rose further in
October.
The November rise in wholesale industrial prices was at a
post World War II record of 3.2 per cent. Fuels, particularly petroleum
and products, accounted for the bulk of the rise. But increases were
widespread for other commodities, amounting to about 1 per cent on

I- 3
average. Wholesale prices of farm products and foods declined for the
third consecutive month. In October, consumer prices had risen sharply,
to a level almost 8 per cent above a year earlier.
Outlook. The energy crisis has injected major uncertainties
into the outlook. The magnitude and duration of the shortfall in oil
supplies are still in doubt, and the Administration is still in the
process of making basic decisions on a conservation program. The current
staff GNP projection is based on the following assumptions with respect
to petroleum and products: (1) The Arab embargo on shipments of mid-
East oil to the United States will not be lifted during 1974. (2) The
shortfall of oil supplies will amount to around 3-1/2 million barrels
per day, or more than 15 per cent of estimated demand, and about 7
per cent of total U. S. energy needs. (3) All classes of users will
suffer at least some cutback in supply, but the burden will fall heaviest
on consumers, with the aggregate supply of gasoline available to them
reduced by 30 per cent in early 1974. Industrial uses for process
heating and for production inputs will be largely insulated from the
shortage to minimize adverse effects on employment and incomes.
(4) Gasoline will be allocated both by permitting sharply higher prices
and by eventually adopting some form of direct rationing, Wholesale
prices of gasoline are expected to rise some 30 per cent from late 1973
to late 1974.
The staff also has incorporated the following assumptions in
the 1974 GNP projections: (1) Growth in M1 will average about 5
per cent over the year. Short-term market rates are expected to average

I -4
somewhat below current levels although fluctuating fairly widely during
the year. (2) With respect to fiscal developments, social security
benefits are now assumed to increase 7 per cent on January 1 and an
additional 4 per cent on June 1. To defray the increased costs, the wage
base has been raised by $600 from the previously scheduled figure, to
$13,200, effective January 1. (3) Price and wage controls will be
continued in some form beyond the present April expiration date, but with
more activities removed from control over the course of the year.
On these assumptions, real GNP is now projected to decline
somewhat in the first half of 1974, and then to resume a modest rate of
increase in the second half. But from late 1973 to late 1974, the rise
in real GNP is projected at only about 1/2 per cent, compared to 2-1/2
per cent in the November projection.
The unemployment rate is now projected to rise appreciably in
the first half of the year, and to increase further to about 6 per cent
by year-end. Prices are expected to advance appreciably more than in
the preceding projection, primarily because of prospective large increases
in petroleum and products. The gross private fixed weight price index
is projected to increase at an annual rate of about 6-1/2 per cent in
the first half and 5-1/2 per cent in the second half.
The further weakness in activity now projected for much of
1974 mainly reflects the consequences of the oil crisis. Apart from
reduced purchases of gasoline, oil, and related petroleum products
(whose effects on GNP will be offset in part by less petroleum imports),
the sectors most likely to be adversely affected are automobiles (and

I -5
complementary products such as tires and accessories), and a variety
of travel-related activities such as motel services, restaurant meals,
recreation, suburban housing, and purchases of aircraft by commercial
airlines. As the year goes on, consumers and businesses are expected
to adapt to the reduced supply of petroleum in ways that encourage a
resumption of growth in overall real economic activity.

Industrial production. Industrial production, following
downward revisions in September and October, rose 0.2 per cent in
November, the same rate of increase as shown by the downward revised
September and October figures. The revisions were centered in business
equipment and durable and nondurable goods materials. The total index
in November at 127.2 per cent of the 1967 average was 5.8 per cent above
a year earlier.

Auto assemblies in November were at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 9.6 million units, up from the 9.4 million rate in October.
December auto production schedules now indicate a 9.2 million rate but
this may not be realized. Output of most household appliances and TV
sets were maintained at advanced levels in November, while production of
furniture declined. Output of nondurable consumer goods changed little
despite curtailment of residential electricity consumption. Production
of business equipment, following a decline in October, rose in November,

I -11
returning to the September level. Output of industrial materials
declined in November. Production of steel was unchanged but output of
most durable and nondurable goods materials, including the textile,
paper, and chemical grouping was down.
Retail sales. In November, retail sales were virtually
unchanged from October, according to the advance estimate, and with a
large downward revision in the earlier estimate of sales in October, the
fourth quarter may be somewhat lower than previously anticipated. In
November durable goods sales declined 0.3 per cent, with a 1.3 per cent
drop in the automotive group partially offset by some recovery in sales
of furniture and appliances. Nondurable goods sales increased 0.3
per cent with the food group almost unchanged, sales of gasoline down and
outlays for general merchandise up 1.3 per cent. Excluding autos and
nonconsumption items, sales were up 0.4 per cent from the previous month.
Compared to the third quarter, sales in November were up only
1.3 per cent, with sales of nondurable goods increasing 2.3 per cent
but with the durable goods group relatively weak.

Unit sales of consumer durables. November sales of new
domestic-type autos were at an 8.7 million unit annual rate, the same
as in October but 13 per cent below a year earlier. Sales of domestic
small cars continued to recover from their third quarter low caused by
production shortfalls and attained a market share equal to the 31 per
cent of the second quarter. Total stocks of domestic-type cars were

1.6 million units at the end of November, unadjusted, a record for the
month; they amounted to a 64.8 days supply, up sharply from the 57.8
days supply at the end of October and the 45.6 days supply in November
1972. The overhang of large cars is extremely heavy.
Foreign car sales in November were at a 1.7 million unit
annual rate, up 14 per cent from October but 6 per cent below a year
earlier. The import share, on a seasonally adjusted basis was 15.0
per cent, about the same as in October and in November last year.
In November, factory unit sales of major appliances, TVs, and
radios are estimated to have risen 3 per cent from October. Factory
sales of major appliances were about the same as in October as three
items of the index were up, three were down, and three were unchanged.
TV sales were up 7 per cent, almost entirely because of strength in
color set purchases; radios, which are largely imported, were up 12
per cent.

Consumer surveys. The two most recent surveys by the
Conference Board and the Michigan Survey Research Center were in the
field before the public was fully aware of the oil shortage. Both
surveys indicated some improvement in the very depressed consumer
attitudes about both present and expected business and personal
financial situations. But Michigan reports that respondents were
progressively more pessimistic as the survey continued from mid-October
to mid-November. In apparent contradiction to the improved attitudes,
buying plans for houses dropped sharply in the Conference Board survey,
and plans to purchase autos and appliances were relatively low.
Michigan does not report intentions to purchase, but responses to their
questions on whether it is a good or bad time to buy have become
increasingly unfavorable. In the latest survey, more than twice as
many respondents said that now is a bad time to buy a car or house
than said that it was a good time; until May of this year favorable
evaluations of market conditions had outweighted unfavorable responses.
The Michigan index of consumer sentiment, a composite measure
of five questions on consumer attitudes toward business and personal
financial situations, increased moderately. The newly devised
Conference Board index of confidence, also constructed from five
attitudinal questions quite similar to the Michigan questions, rose
very strongly. However, both indexes were still below their year-
earlier levels.

I -15
The greater relative improvement of the Conference Board
index may reflect the month-earlier timing of the survey. Michigan
found that there was concern about the energy crisis in the second
quarter, but that it had largely disappeared in the third quarter and
was only emerging again in the first weeks of November. Apparently,
when the Conference Board conducted its interviews from mid-September
to mid-October, the public had largely forgotten the spring gasoline
shortage, and had somewhat adjusted to the Watergate revelations and
higher food costs. Experience with consumer surveys indicates that
the public usually gets used to bad news, and if no new problem emerges,
tends to become more optimistic.
Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place--revised upward somewhat for recent
months--edged down 1 per cent in November to $133 billion. Outlays
for private residential construction continued to fall and were more
than a tenth below the March 1973 peak. Private nonresidential
construction remained at the record rate reached in October. Public
construction tended upward in November but was still below the peak
reached early this year.

Increasing costs in recent months continued to be a significant
factor in the current dollar value of construction put in place. In
the third quarter as a whole, the Commerce Department composite cost
index was 10 per cent above a year ago, compared with an average
increase of 7 per cent in each of the preceding two years. Including
lot value, the price index of comparable new one-family houses sold
during the third quarter was 13 per cent higher than a year earlier,
or double the average increase in 1972.-

Anticipated plant and equipment spending. The Commerce
Department's latest survey of plant and equipment anticipations--
taken in late October and early November--showed that businesses were
still planning a 13.2 per cent increase in capital spending for 1973,
with manufacturers expecting a slightly larger gain than planned
earlier. Actual third quarter expenditures (at annual rates) were $1.0
billion less than indicated in September, continuing a pattern character-
istic of recent quarters. The short-fall is expected to be made up in
the fourth quarter.
The December survey also contained the Commerce Department's
first look at capital spending planned for early 1974. Following an
anticipated 4.0 per cent gain in the fourth quarter, outlays were
expected to rise 3.1 per cent in the first quarter and 3.5 per cent in
the second quarter of 1974, a combined increase of 13.5 per cent over
the first half of 1973. Manufacturers continue to plan substantially
larger increases in capital spending than nonmanufacturing industries,
in line with the findings of private surveys for the year 1974.

Conference Board data also indicate significant strength in
capital spending. Newly approved capital appropriations of large
manufacturing companies continued to rise in the third quarter, sparked
by a sizable gain for durable goods producers. Backlogs of unspent
appropriations remained at very high levels and could support the
current level of manufacturers' spending for another four and a half
quarters.
Manufacturers orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 4.0 per cent in October (p)--3.3 per cent excluding defense--
following a 1.0 per cent drop in September. Nondefense capital goods
orders rose 3.2 per cent.
Shipments of durable goods were up 3.5 per cent in October
following a 1.3 per cent rise in September. Backlogs of unfilled
orders continued to increase rapidly.
For the third quarter new orders for durable goods averaged
only 0.7 per cent above the second quarter, a smaller increase than
earlier in the year. The slowdown was widespread. Nondefense capital
goods orders rose 2.3 per cent compared with gains of about 6 per
cent reported in the first and second quarters.
Unfilled orders for durable goods, on the other hand, continued
to increase rapidly in the third quarter to a level about one-third
higher than in the third quarter of 1972 and 44 per cent above the
cyclical trough in the fourth quarter of 1970.

Inventories. The book value of manufacturing and trade
inventories rose at a $25.0 billion annual rate in October (p)--up from
the $18.5 billion September rate and the $19.8 billion third quarter
rate. Manufacturers' stocks rose a bit less rapidly than in September
as inventories of finished goods were drawn down. But retail trade
inventories increased at an $11.7 billion annual rate--the most rapid
monthly gain in 1973--with accumulation especially noticeable in autos
and nondurable goods. Wholesale inventories rose a little more
slowly in October than in September.

Of the eight leading series available, those increasing
were initial claims for unemployment insurance (inverted), new orders
for durable goods, contracts and orders for plant and equipment,
industrial materials prices and common stock prices. Housing permits
and the average workweek in manufacturing both declined. After the
compilation, the change in instalment credit was reported to have
risen substantially in October.

Labor market. The labor market continued to display sub-
stantial strength in November as nonfarm payroll employment rose
briskly and unemployment for most experienced worker categories remained
little changed. The total unemployment rate, however, climbed back to
4.7 per cent after dropping in October to a recent low of 4.5 per cent.
The November data do not reflect the impact of energy shortages which
probably will not show up significantly in the statistics until January.
The increase in unemployment was centered in those groups
where the rate had dropped in October--teenagers and young men 20-24
years old--although joblessness also rose in November for women 25 and
over. Unlike the payroll employment series, household survey employment
was about unchanged in November, while the civilian labor force increased
nearly 200,000--all among full time workers.

Nonfarm payroll employment (establishment series) rose
200,000 in November and has increased nearly one million since July.
Manufacturing employment rose about 50,000 in November; less than half
of this was among production workers, however, and in durable goods
manufacturing, production worker employment showed no change. The
factory workweek remained at 40.6 hours in November, 0.4 hour shorter
than the recent peak reached in February; and manhours in manufacturing
were little changed. Over the past two months factory employment has
increased 170,000, following virtually no growth from June to September.
Strong employment gains have continued in trade, services and State and
local government.

Earnings. Although wage rate increases have slowed somewhat

at a rapid rate since early 1973. The index has risen at a 7 per cent
annual rate since March compared to a 5.6 per cent rate during most of
Phase II, with a speed up evident in most industries.

Collective bargaining. General Motors and the United Auto
Workers reached agreement on a new three year contract. The settlement
is reported to follow closely those at Chrysler and Ford which called
for basic wage increases of 3 per cent a year, a first-year "catch-up"
of 12 cents an hour, an improved cost-of-living escalator clause and
increased pensions. Subsequent to the agreement, wages in the automobile
industry were decontrolled by the Cost of Living Council.
Consumer prices. The rise in consumer prices accelerated in
October to an annual rate of over 10 per cent, seasonally adjusted.
This brought the "All items" index to a level 8 per cent above October
1972, with the food component up 19 per cent. Food prices resumed their

I -25
rise in October along with a sharp acceleration in prices of other
commodities, notably fuels. Service costs posted their largest advance
since March 1970.

Despite further large declines for meats, poultry and eggs,
food prices rose at a 6.7 per cent annual rate in October. There were
sharp increases for dairy, cereal and bakery products, fruits and vegetables
and restaurant meals and snacks.
The surge in gasoline and fuel oil prices lifted the index
for other commodities and contributed, roughly, 0.1 percentage point--

I -26
over one per cent at an annual rate--to the rise in the "All items"
index. October prices for gasoline were 10 per cent, and for fuel oil
14 per cent, higher than 12 months earlier. Larger increases are
expected in November and later months. However, new car prices were
down, seasonally adjusted, as a result of the COLC delay in authorizing
increases on the 1974 models. The advances approved by COLC in September
involved only the cost of Government-mandated emission control and
safety equipment, but this was less than the estimated adjustment for
quality improvement incorporated in the index. Used car prices also
fell in October.
Service prices jumped as mortgage costs rose sharply in
October for the second month. In addition, the annual adjustment to the
health insurance component weighed heavily in the increase and raised
the index for medical services to a level 5.6 per cent above October 1972.
During the year the rise in the cost of health insurance is estimated
from price indexes for health services. At the end of the fiscal year
for the health insurers, financial data become available and are used
to correct the earlier estimates. The 1972 adjustment was also upward,
although smaller, but in previous years this procedure involved over-
estimates and, therefore, downward adjustments.
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose from October to
November by 1.8 per cent, seasonally adjusted (23.3 per cent at an
annual rate), as a result of widespread and large price increases for
industrial commodities. Prices of farm and food products declined for
the third consecutive month.

The index of industrial commodities rose 3.2 per cent (45.2
per cent at an annual rate) in November, the largest monthly increase
since 1947.1/ The fuels and power group increased by nearly one-fifth
and accounted for more than two-thirds of the overall increase in the
index of industrial commodities. But large increases were also reported
for metals and metal products, textile products, chemicals and allied
products, plywood, paper products, and machinery. Apart from fuels and
power, the index of industrial commodities rose by about one per cent.
1/ This is the largest seasonally adjusted increase recorded since
the seasonally adjusted series was inaugurated in May 1947. The
unadjusted increase of 3.0 per cent was equalled in January 1947
and exceeded in November and December 1946.

The rise in gasoline prices accounted for nearly one-half of
the rise in the fuels and power group, and distillates were responsible
for most of the remainder.
It is possible that a large, but as yet unquantifiable, upward
bias exists in the index for refined petroleum products, and that the
average prices of gasoline and other products are rising less rapidly
than indicated. BLS announced that prices of refined products used in
the index are chiefly quotations from spot markets which now appear

I -29
to represent a declining portion of the transactions taking place in
domestic markets. (BLS now has a study under way to improve this index).
On December 6, the Cost-of-Living Council exempted 40 non-
ferrous metals from Phase IV price controls. Among the metals decontrolled
were lead, zinc, tin, gold, silver, and platinum. Most nonferrous scrap
metals were also exempted. (Other commodities not under regulation
include copper scrap, fertilizer, lumber, and cement.)
Prices of aluminum and copper were not decontrolled because
it was felt that decontrol would result in "unacceptably large price
increases". The Council did authorize price increases for these metals,
however--about 16 per cent, to 29 cents a pound, for aluminum and about
13 per cent, to 68 cents a pound, for copper. Although these prices
are still far below foreign prices, with the differential reduced, it is
hoped that the rising volume of exports will be curtailed.
On December 10, the Cost-of-Living Council exempted major
automobile manufacturers from wage and price controls on the understanding
that producers will limit price increases on 1974 models.
Agriculture. Prices received by farmers declined 1-1/2 per
cent during the month ending November 15, but were still 38 per cent
above a year ago. It was the third straight monthly decline, with lower
livestock prices again a major factor. Milk and potato prices moved up
during the month.
Grain and soybean prices remained at high levels through
harvest peak and have moved up further in early December. Strong export

I -30
demand has absorbed much of the impact of larger crops. A drop in
grain exports to the USSR and the EEC during the 1973-74 crop year will
probably be more than offset by larger exports to Eastern Europe, Japan,
China, Africa and India.
On November 25, reported sales of corn, milo, barley, oats,
and wheat for delivery to identified destinations during the 1973-74
crop year were only 7 per cent below total overseas deliveries in 1972-
73. Inclusion of sales to unidentified destinations pushes the total
to 6 per cent above last year, and more sales later in the crop year
seem certain.
November red meat and poultry production increased 4-1/2
per cent (p) to the highest level in a year and was a major factor in
recent weak livestock prices. Low profitability in feeding operations
has led to declining placements of cattle on feedlots from June through
October (seasonally adjusted). As a result, fed cattle marketings may
drop early next year. However, the large number of feeder calves now
being held on pasture are expected to enter feedlots at heavier weights
and more quickly reach market condition, bringing a recovery in beef
supply in the spring.
High feed prices continue to limit milk production which,
during October, was 5 per cent below a year earlier. Lower protein
feeding rates have brought the first annual decline in output per cow in
30 years. However, November egg settings indicate broiler supplies
will continue above year-earlier levels at least into February.

THE ECONOMIC PICTURE IN DETAIL
DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Since the last Committee meeting, private short-term interest
rates generally moved somewhat higher, while long-term rates showed
little net change. Treasury bill rates declined on balance, however,
as foreign central bank liquidation of dollar assets slackened.
Following the announcement on December 7 of a reduction in marginal
reserve requirements on large CD's and related liabilities, there was
a drop in some market rates, particularly yields on Treasury bills.
Business demand for short-term credit has remained generally
strong, with the total of business borrowing in November at banks and
in the commercial paper market combined close to the third quarter
rate. The increased cost of commercial paper relative to bank loans
last month induced some borrowers to shift back to commercial banks,
and consequently business loans at banks expanded fairly rapidly
following weak growth over the preceding two months. Banks became
more aggressive bidders for large negotiable CD's after mid-November
as demands strengthened and growth in consumer time and savings deposits
slowed.
In the capital markets, stock prices have declined about
15 per cent from the recent high reached late in October prior to the
uncertainties generated by the energy crisis. Investors have absorbed
large amounts of corporate and tax-exempt bonds during recent weeks at
relatively stable rates. Credit demands of the Treasury and Federal

II -2
agencies, however, have declined sharply. In fact, Agency financ-
ings have dropped to the lowest level of the year due to a reduced
need for support of the residential mortgage market.
The improved pace of deposit flows to thrift institutions,
which began in September, was sustained in November. Certificate
inflows (including the 4-year certificates) are reported to have
accounted for a major share of the recent deposit growth. Advances
to S&L's by the FHL Banks in November virtually ceased, and S&L's
have been able to reduce indebtedness to commercial banks and also to
rebuild depleted liquid asset positions. Mortgage rates continued to
decline in November and by early December rates in the primary market
were more than 30 basis points below their late September high.
Outlook. Interest rates over the next few weeks will be
strongly influenced by expectations. Signs of an easing in monetary
policy and/or an appreciable weakness in economic activity would be
likely to move interest rates downward. Total credit demands may be
expected to weaken in the first half of 1974, but over the near-term
the outlook for the total and sectoral pattern of credit demands is
uncertain. It would appear, given the revised GNP projection, that
a decline in demand and a shift in its composition is in prospect.
But such changes are likely to occur with varying lags, depending
on the sector involved.
In the short-term, business credit demands will be sustained
by rising inventory accumulation, continued strength in capital outlays,
and a decline in the rate of internal funds generation. The proportion

II -3
of business credit demands likely to be focused on commercial banks
will depend not only on the relative levels of the bank prime rate
and commercial paper rate, but on borrower attitudes in regard to
the appropriate timing of long-term financing. Some underwriters
report that firms are considering postponing prospective bond offer-
ings in anticipation of a decline in long-term rates.
Demands of the Federal sector on financial markets will
probably be light during the next few months. The Treasury is
projected to need no new cash until March, assuming no significant
liquidation of Treasury special issues by foreign official accounts.
Agency financing should be small as a result of reductions in mort-
gage credit demand and the greater availability of private funds
for housing.
At current short-term market rate levels, and against the
background of recent experience, flows at thrift institutions are
likely to remain generally favorable; and if there is a decline in
market interest rates,savings flows are likely to show further
improvement. Moreover, savings flows could be strengthened by
precautionary demands for liquid assets related to the economic
uncertainties generated by the energy crisis. S&L's likely would
use new funds initially to repay high cost borrowings from the
FHLBanks and to continue rebuilding of liquidity positions. While
thrift institutions also can be expected to seek to increase their
mortgage commitments and acquisitions, the demand for mortgage credit

II -4
will probably weaken as borrowers postpone commitments in anticipation
of lower rates and because of general economic uncertainty. On
balance, given the supply-demand outlook mortgage rates are likely
to decline further.
Finally, consumer credit demands are likely to fall
substantially as the demand for automobiles, motor and mobile homes,
boats, and other recreational goods declines because of the fuel
shortage. These reductions may be offset only in small part by
increased credit demands related to home improvements--especially
those of an energy-conserving type.

II -5
Monetary aggregates. Growth in all the monetary aggregates
accelerated in November as M1 increased at the most rapid rate since
mid-year. The faster growth in the broader measures, M2 and M3, was
solely the result of the accelerated expansion in M1, Inflows of
consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks increased somewhat less
rapidly in November than October, and inflows at thrift institutions
were only moderately higher.
Some of the strong growth in M1 during November probably re-
flected a return to more normal rates of increase in transactions bal-
ances. However, it also may have been associated with the uncertainties
generated by the energy crisis and the steep decline in stock prices.
Special foreign transactions--including an increase in foreign govern-
ment deposits at Federal Reserve Banks 1/ and a rise in deposits of
foreign commercial banks at large U. S. banks--further added to M1
growth in November.
Inflows of time deposits other than large CD's at commercial
banks remained strong, but were below the October pace. Moreover,
most of the increase in the November average was the result of growth
in late October. After mid-November, inflows of small denomination
time deposits weakened considerably.
1/ Foreign central banks liquidated Treasury securities in November in
order to obtain dollars to support their own currencies. About one-
half of these sales were by one central bank which elected temporarily
to hold the proceeds in the form of balances at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. Such deposits are part of measured M1.

With other deposit inflows strong, banks continued to allow
large negotiable CD's to run off during the early part of November. These
runoffs ceased around mid-month, however, when smaller inflows of other
time deposits and increasing credit demands induced banks to bid more
aggressively for CD funds. CD rates, which had declined steadily during
October, increased 50 to 75 basis points in November. Apparently antici-
pating future declines in interest rates, banks emphasized short maturity
CD's. The average maturity of CD's sold in November declined to 1,6
months (preliminary), the shortest maturity in the 8-year history of the
series; the average maturity of outstanding CD's in November, at 2.1
months, is also the shortest on record.
Despite the pick-up in CD sales and overnight Euro-dollar
borrowing late in the month, outstanding CD's declined on average more
than $1.2 billion in November, and non-deposit sources of funds for the
month increased by only $200 million. The CD runoff on average for the
month, accompanied by a decline in U. S. Government deposits, almost
completely offset the increased inflows of private demand and other time
deposits. As a result, the adjusted member bank credit proxy as in
October, increased only marginally in November.
Bank credit. Growth in total loans and investments of commercial
banks in November (last-Wednesday-of-the-month series, seasonally adjusted)
remained relatively moderate for the third consecutive month. Total loans,
however, expanded somewhat faster in reflection of a pick-up in business
loans following two months of little or no growth. Most other loan

II -8
categories--including real estate and consumer loans--were weaker in
November relative to the strong growth rates evidenced throughout most
of the year. Liquidation of U. S. Treasury securities by banks slowed
down considerably in November from the pace set in recent months. Other
security holdings, which had been increasing, declined as well.

While large banks outside New York City also experienced a
noticeable pick-up in business borrowing, a substantial part of the growth
in business loans in November was concentrated at New York City banks.
Data for all weekly reporting banks indicate considerable variability

II -9
in credit demands among industries with borrowing by public utilities--
other than transportation and communication--and commodity dealers
showing unusual strength,
Some of the pick-up in business borrowing probably reflected
the narrowing spread between the 9.75 per cent prime rate--offered by
the majority of banks during November--and commercial paper rates, which
rose more than 50 basis points over the month. As bank credit demands
accelerated, outstanding dealer-placed commercial paper in November in-
creased by less than half the strong expansion of October, when the rate
spread was much less favorable to banks. On balance, total short-term
credit demand, as measured by the sum of business loans and commercial
paper, increased at a 17.1 per cent annual rate in November--somewhat
less rapid than in October but slightly above the third quarter average.1/
Growth in real estate loans at commercial banks has moderated
over the course of the year. In November, these loans increased at a
13.6 per cent annual rate, compared with about a 20 per cent annual rate
in the first half. Consumer loans also are estimated to have increased
less rapidly in November, apparently due in part to the shift in sales
from large to compact automobiles.
The reduced rate of loan expansion since August and the increase
in Treasury bill holdings in November have raised the liquidity positions
of commercial banks. At weekly reporting banks, the ratio of liquid assets
to liabilities has risen for four consecutive months following a steady
decline over the preceding nine months.

Nonbank financial institutions. According to preliminary
data, deposit flows to nonbank thrift institutions were moderately
stronger in November than in the previous month--with deposit growth
at S&L's maintained at about the same improved rate as in October,
and flows into MSB's showing a considerable increase over the reduced
October pace. At both sets of institutions, certificates of deposit--
especially 4-year certificates--constituted the major portion of, if
not the entire, net inflow.

FHLBank net advances to S&L's were nominal during November,
totaling only $60 million as compared with almost $500 million in
October. Although November balance sheet data are not yet available,
S&L's used some of their available funds in October to repay other
borrowings, primarily bank loans. In addition, S&L's used a substan-
tial portion of their increased deposit flow to rebuild liquidity--

following a $3.2 billion reduction in liquid assets during the third
quarter.
At life insurance companies, policy loan activity reached
a peak rate in August. September data showed a small decline in the
growth of policy loans, and comparable sample data for October indi-
cate an appreciable further slowdown, presumably reflecting the easing
of market interest rates between mid-September and late October.
Consumer credit. Consumer credit outstanding rose $25.2
billion in October, seasonally adjusted annual rate. The expansion
in instalment debt--$20.4 billion--equaled the average rate of advance
during the second and third quarters, but was below the record first
quarter rate of $24 billion. Growth in automobile credit during
October slowed to the lowest seasonally adjusted rate of the year,
as extensions continued to decline and repayments advanced to another
new high. Increases in personal loans and home improvement loans in
October matched the third quarter gains, and nonautomotive consumer
goods credit rose further.

The increase in interest rates on consumer loans--
which has lagged changes in most other market rates--generally
slackened in October. Finance company rates on new car contracts,
after a 15 basis point rise in September, advanced 6 basis points in
October; bank rates were up 19 and 9 basis points, respectively, dur-
ing the same months.
The record volume of consumer credit extended during
the past year may be partly responsible for a recent increase in
loan repayment difficulties. The delinquency rate on consumer in-
stalment loans at commercial banks, which had declined on a seasonally
adjusted basis during the summer months, rose to a 20-year high in
October. The number of loans delinquent 30-89 days as a per cent of
all consumer instalment loans held by banks reached 1.83 per cent,
2 basis points above the previous peak in April. Also, personal
bankruptcies rose more than 5 per cent in the third quarter to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 166,000 filings. While this was
the highest rate since the fourth quarter of 1971, it was still well
below the most recent cyclical peak of 193,000 in the third quarter
of 1970. Despite the recent uptrend, personal bankruptcies for the
full year 1973 are likely to be only slightly above the nine-year low
of 159,000 filings in 1972.

Commercial paper outstanding. Commercial paper outstanding
increased an estimated $1.6 billion, seasonally adjusted, during
November--a sizable increase but well below the exceptionally rapid
rise in October. While all types of paper contributed to this expan-
sion, an estimated $1.1 billion was attributable to nonbank-related
dealer placed paper, which benefited from lower interest rates in
relation to the prime rate until the latter part of November.
Nonbank-related directly placed paper registered an
estimated $400 million growth as finance company subsidiaries of
large automotive manufacturers reported continuing needs for funds
to reduce bank debt and finance wholesale receivables. Bank-related
paper showed a small increase in November after declining in October.

Short-term rates. Rates in short-term credit markets have
fluctuated considerably since the November FOMC meeting, to a large
extent because of changing market views about the likely future course
of monetary policy. On balance, key private rates rose somewhat
while Treasury bill rates declined.
For a week or so after the November meeting, rates continued
to decline from their mid-November highs, as many professionals came
to feel that monetary policy would soon ease in response to the
energy shortage and an impending slowdown in the economy. Rates on
short-dated bills, in particular, dropped significantly, perhaps
because precautionary demands for liquid assets by the public rose in
the face of the uncertain economic outlook. Also, foreign central
banks bought over $500 million of bills in the market, reinvesting
part of the funds they obtained from sales of Government coupon and
Agency issues primarily to the System.
In late November and early December, rates rose moderately,
however, as tightness persisted in the Federal funds market, with
trading generally around a 10-1/4 per cent rate. At the same time,
many observers began to feel that the Fed might not ease in response to
the energy shortage, and Chairman Burns' testimony before a Congressional
Committee on December 4 was widely interpreted as support for this view.
Upward rate pressures developed in the banking sector in particular,
as business firms, reacting to the rise in commercial paper rates,
turned back to the banks for short-term credit. Rates on large

II -16
negotiable CD's rose markedly, and bank prime rates moved up into
a 9.75--10.00 per cent range around the beginning of December.
Treasury bill rates also rose, in part because the auction
of tax bills on November 28 was somewhat larger than expected. This
offering--$1 billion of reopened April TABs and $2 billion of June
TABs--wound up largely in the hands of dealers, at a time when
dealer position carrying costs were quite high. Shortly thereafter,
the bill market was affected by uncertainty due to delay in passage
of new debt ceiling legislation. A bill raising the debt limit to
$475.7 billion was passed on Monday, December 3, but only after
the Treasury had been forced to defer the weekly bill auction.
More recently, rates have turned down again, as the market
interpreted a lowering of marginal CD reserve requirements on
December 7 as evidence that the Fed had indeed shifted toward ease.
Bill rates, especially, have declined, continuing the greatly
increased volatility of these rates in the last two months or so.
Looking ahead, the Treasury may not need to raise new cash
until March 1974, barring a substantial renewal of redemptions of
Treasury non-marketable issues by foreign central banks. Such redemp-
tions have slowed considerably--from a pace of about $550 million per
week between the October and November meetings, to about $60 million
per week since then. In the Agency market, both the Federal Home Loan
Banks and FNMA have lowered their borrowing plans, reflecting reduced
demand on these Agencies to support the housing market. As a result,

II -17
it presently appears that Agency borrowing from December through
March 1974 may amount to about $2.7 billion, rather than the $3.9
billion projected earlier.

Long-term securities markets. On balance, long-term rates
have changed little since the last FOMC meeting. They declined during
the latter half of November despite a large volume of new offerings
of corporate and municipal bonds. Early in December, rising short-
term rates and a growing volume of both unsold issues in syndicate and
secondary market inventories led to some back-up in long-term yields,
which continued despite the announcement of a reduction in marginal
reserve requirements on large CD's.

The reaction to the energy crisis and its associated effects
was much more pronounced in the stock market. After reaching a peak
in late October, the Dow Jones Industrial average fell over 153 points,
or about 15 per cent, in active trading; other broader market indices
fell about the same relative amount. Brokers report that the decline
may have been aggravated by the large number of margin calls they had
to make to investors who generally opted to liquidate their positions
rather than put up more collateral.
The over-all volume of corporate security offerings remains
quite high, with the fourth quarter now projected to be about 40 per
cent above the average for the first 3 quarters. Most of the increase
is attributable to a sharp rise in publicly offered bonds, with December
projected to decline less than seasonally from the November total.
Stock offerings also are expected to fall in December from the high
rate of the preceding month, which reflected mainly issues by utilities,
In the private placement market, volume in December is expected to
increase for seasonal reasons.
On the basis of current schedulings, and expected additions
to the calendar, the January public bond volume is projected to rise
from the reduced December level. Underwriters report, however, that
the energy crisis has created expectations of an economic slowdown and
possible interest rate declines later on, prompting some corporations
to reevaluate financing plans and, in some cases, also the associated
capital expenditure plans. But, as yet, there has been no discernible
effect on the bond calendar.

The volume of municipal bond financing in November and the
volume forecast for January are above the monthly average for the
first three quarters, with December being low for seasonal reasons.
An increasing proportion of recent municipal financing continues to
be made up of special revenue issues and industrial pollution control
bonds. These issues, many of longer-term and higher yield, have
reportedly been especially attractive to fire and casualty insurance
companies which have been a major support to the municipal market this
year.
Mortgage market. Mortgage market conditions apparently have
eased somewhat further in November and early December. Savings and
loan associations increased slightly their new mortgage commitments
in October--the first monthly increase since January--and tentative

II -21
estimates suggest that there was some additional rise in November,
after seasonal adjustment. Even so, the backlog of mortgage commitments
outstanding at S&L's apparently declined further in November, as loan
takedowns under earlier commitments continued to exceed the flow of
new commitments.
With lending by savings and loan associations at reduced
levels, commercial banks have been accounting for an unusually large
share of a reduced volume of mortgage credit expansion. For the three
months ending in November, the net increase in commercial bank holdings
of mortgages on all types of properties exceeded that of any other type
of lender.
In the primary mortgage market, recent declines in the average
contract interest rate on new commitments for 80 per cent conventional
home loans at selected S&L's have been smaller than in earlier weeks.
On December 7, this series was 32 basis points below its late September
high. Field reports suggest that some demand for new commitments by
builders and would-be buyers has continued to be discouraged not only
by current rate levels, which are still well above prevailing usury
ceilings in a number of states, but also by the energy crisis and by
anticipations of further rate declines in the near future. These
expectations have been accompanied by a reduction in the number of FHL
Bank districts reporting funds in short supply and also by scattered

II -22
rumors that the present 8-1/2 per cent contract interest rate on FHA/VA
mortgages, which has been in effect since late August, will soon be
reduced.

In the secondary market, yields on Government-underwritten
mortgages have declined further from the mid-September peak, primarily
reflecting a low level of loan originations and continuing strong
demand for such loans by mortgage companies and others in order to
complete mortgage pools to back GNMA-guaranteed securities which they
have already agreed to issue. Reflecting these developments, the
volume of offerings to FNMA of short-term commitments to purchase home
mortgages has remained so low in recent bi-weekly auctions that FNMA
has delayed by one week the auctions originally scheduled for December 10.
The delinquency rate on home mortgages (MBA series) rose some-
what further during the third quarter.to a seasonally-adjusted level
of 4.3 per cent of outstanding loans held by reporting institutions, a
new high for the series which began in 1953. Although delinquency
rates on both conventional and Federally-underwritten home mortgages
were above year-earlier levels, they continued to be particularly high
for FHA-insured loans, especially those associated with the interest-
rate subsidy programs which were suspended earlier this year.
Agricultural finance. Net new borrowing by the farming
sector (farm operators and landlords) is estimated at a record $7.6
billion in 1973, only 4 per cent more than in 1972 but 89 per cent
above the annual average for 1967-71. Capital flows for investment
and farm transfer purposes, estimated at $25.8 billion, were 26 per

II -24
cent above those of 1972, but higher farm income and rising interest
rates apparently prompted relatively greater reliance on internal
funds for financing these flows.
Among major farm capital flows, the sharpest rise in both
1972 and 1973 occurred in the purchase of real estate from discontinuing
proprietors. The farm income gains since 1971 have been accompanied
by a land price boom that has now reached dimensions without parallel
since World War I. The Department of Agriculture's November 1 survey
places the national farm real estate price index 20 per cent above a
year earlier--the largest annual rise since 1919. Increases among
States ranged from 10 per cent in Louisiana to 30 per cent in Colorado.
The land price rise reflects the extraordinary profitability of crop
production in 1973 and in prospect for 1974, as well as widespread
belief that the longer-term equilibrium level of crop prices has moved
upward because of increased foreign demand and new farm legislation
employing a system of "target prices" that are above previous support
levels.
For the first time since 1919, the increase in the total
value of farm real estate exceeded annual net farm income in 1972 and
again in 1973. The unusually rapid increase in wealth probably
raises both the ability and willingness of farm landowners to incur
additional debt.

Given these divergent trends, it forecasts that farmers will choose to
increase net new borrowing from the record $7.6 billion in 1973 to
between $10 and $12 billion in 1974, with much of the increase occurring

Federal finance. The staff has made the following revisions
in its estimates of Federal receipts and expenditures (NIA basis) for
calendar year 1974. These changes mostly reflect the projected economic
impact of the energy shortage and program adjustments expected to result
from Congressional action.

1/ Individual entries may not add to total because of rounding.
The reductions in estimated receipts are due primarily to
lower income projections. No allowance has been made to reflect the
possibility of tax increases on petroleum products. We are assuming a
larger social security tax base because it now appears that Congress
will approve an increase from $10,800 to $13,200 beginning in January.

II -27
Previously, the law had scheduled an increase to $12,600. Because it
is a base rather than a rate change, however, this tax increase will not
affect cash receipts significantly until the second half of the calendar
year when cumulated earnings surpass the former $10,800 maximum taxable
income level.
The increase in social security outlays reflects the current
assumption of a 7 per cent increase in benefits payable in February and
an additional 4 per cent in July. On a gross basis, these benefit boosts
will add $5.2 billion to expenditures, but the previous projection had
already allowed for a substantial portion of this change. Thus far, the
House bill calls for the first increase in payments to be made in April,
while the Senate version contemplates an immediate starting date. Esti-
mates of transfers to persons in the form of unemployment benefits have
also been raised--by $1.6 billion during the coming calendar year--to
reflect the projected increase in unemployment. Finally, some increase
in outlays is earmarked for research on new sources of energy during
the second half of calendar 1974.
It should be noted that the full employment budget shown above
does not reflect a possible downward adjustment in potential GNP related
to the energy crisis, even though the usual assumption of a 4.3 per cent
growth in potential output may no longer be appropriate. The full employ-
ment surplus would, of course, be smaller if such an adjustment were made.
On a unified budget basis, the staff is now projecting a
fiscal year 1974 deficit of $5.5 billion. This reflects a cut of $2.5
billion in estimated receipts since the November Greenbook, $1.4 billion

II -28
of which is due to lower income assumptions and the remainder to a
reallocation of receipts across the calendar year. Our estimate of
outlays in the unified budget is unchanged at $272 billion, with increases
in transfer payments likely to be offset by the already evident shortfall
in other budget outlays and by larger receipts from offshore-oil leases,
which appear in the budget as offsets to spending. In a recent state-
ment, OMB Director Ash estimated a fiscal 1974 budget deficit of $2 to $3
billion.
Corporate tax receipts are projected to be unusually large in
the January-June period of 1974 because final payments will reflect high
1973 profits. Since current tax payments on 1973 profits have apparently
been based primarily on the lower profits of calendar 1972, additional
payments will have to be made in March and June. On the other hand,
personal tax refunds are expected to exceed their large 1973 volume.
On the expenditure side, although the House has cut the regular
defense appropriations bill by almost $3.0 billion below the Administration's
request for fiscal 1974, we have not lowered our defense outlays. We
assume that, as a result of the Mideast war, the Defense Department will
prepare another supplemental request that will offset the Congressional
savings. At present, our projection of defense spending does not reflect
any impact of the oil shortage on the procurement of goods other than oil.
Tentative information indicates that any savings resulting from the pro-
posed military cutback in oil usage will be more than offset by price
increases in this area.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and Outlook. Recent developments in the U.S. balance
of payments confirm the impression of a continuing broadly-based improve-
ment in the trade balance, together with generally favorable developments
in private capital flows. Recent gains are reflected in surpluses in
the official settlements balance and a strengthening dollar in the
exchange markets.
Large weekly surpluses in official settlements began to show up
in late October, and the surplus for November is estimated at more than
$2 billion. Also, during November the dollar appreciated by about 5
percent on average against the major foreign currencies, largely on the
basis of market expectations of the relative impacts of the oil crisis
on the economies of the United States, Europe, and Japan. Sales of dollars
by foreign central banks, especially the Japanese central bank, prevented
the dollar from appreciating even more in November. The Dutch guilder,
in addition to the yen, has been particularly hard hit by the oil crisis,
and has been supported with sales of European currencies rather than
dollars.
On the basis of recent fragmentary data on capital flows,
foreigners were still net buyers of U.S. corporate stocks in October
and possibly in early November, but on a much smaller scale than in the
third quarter; reportedly foreigners were net sellers of corporate stocks
after mid-November. There was also a reduction in net foreign purchases
of U.S. corporate bonds after September, and the recent easing of the

III -2
OFDI regulations will tend to diminish end-of-year off-shore sales of
bonds, or foreign bank financing, by U.S. direct investors. U.S.
investors stepped up their purchases of Israeli and Canadian provincial
bonds in October, and there was also a sizable increase in bank lending
in October.
The outlook for overall economic activity here and abroad is
dominated by the uncertainties of the petroleum situation. Even if
shipments of oil from Arab sources were restored to the September 1973
level by mid-1974, foreign countries generally would experience a major
setback in economic activity. Before the oil crisis industrial production
in major foreign countries was expected to rise by about 3-1/2 percent,
on average, from the second half of 1973 to the first half of 1974,
while it now appears, on the basis of a preliminary appraisal, that
industrial production in these countries may not grow at all over this
period. Hardest hit would be Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany.
There would be major consequences for world trade from an oil
shortage extending well into next year. The growth of world trade would
probably be reduced, and the reduction might be aggravated by dispro-
portionate effects of the crisis in different countries, as well as by
a contraction in world shipping facilities. The net effects on trade
balances, or on overall international balances, arising from such a
situation are well-nigh impossible to foresee, although the U.S. payments
position seems likely to remain strong under all conceivable scenarios.

III -3
Foreign exchange markets. The dollar has been in substantial
excess demand in the exchanges over the past six weeks. It appreciated,
on a weighted average basis, by about 6-1/2 per cent from end-October
to mid-December. In addition, a large part of the excess demand was met
by central bank sales of dollars, producing a U.S. official settlements
surplus over that period on the order of $2-1/2 billion, according to
preliminary and partial data. The dollar's strength appears to have been
based, primarily, on the market's interpretation of the relative impact
of the oil crisis on the economies of the United States, Europe, and Japan
and, secondarily, on the continuation of recent strong U.S. trade figures
and the recent rise in U.S. short-term interest rates.
The currency in greatest excess supply during the period was
the Japanese yen, reflecting the expectation that the Japanese BOP,
already in substantial deficit, would be the most severely affected of
all the industrial countries by the oil crisis. The yen depreciated by
more than 5 per cent against the dollar, and the Bank of Japan sold some
$2.7 billion in market intervention. (Part of this intervention is not
reflected in published Japanese reserve figures as it was offset by some
non-market transactions between the monetary authorities and Japanese
commercial banks). Japan took some modest steps in early December to
ease restrictions on capital inflows, but these measures of yet have not
seemed to have much of an impact.
A second currency under particular selling pressure as a result
of the oil crisis has been the Dutch guilder. The guilder declined by
10 per cent against the dollar from end-October to mid-December. During

III -4
the first week of December the guilder required central bank support at
its lower European and Benelux limits, amounting to more than $500 million
equivalent in various European currencies, and there were rumors in the
market -- officially denied -- that the Dutch would undo their 5 per cent
September revaluation. The Netherlands Bank raised its discount rate
from 7 to 8 per cent on December 5, and money market rates in Amsterdam
soared as the central bank allowed the domestic monetary base to contract
as a result of the exchange market intervention. After the weekend passed
and the exchange market pressures substantially abated, the Netherlands
Bank took measures to ease the domestic liquidity situation somewhat,
Other currencies to show particular weakness during the period
included the Italian lira and sterling. Both currencies depreciated con-
siderably against the dollar while still receiving substantial central
bank intervention support. For the six weeks from end-October, Bank of
Italy intervention totaled perhaps $350 million while the Bank of England
sold $170 million spot and $210 million on a short-term swap basis. In
both Britain and Italy the oil crisis came on top of already-deteriorating
inflation/trade balance prospects.
The other major central bank selling dollars was the German
Federal Bank, which intervened sporadically to sell nearly $500 million.
The European currencies which depreciated least against the
dollar were the French and Swiss francs, which declined by 7 and 3 per cent,
respectively. France, of course, is accorded favored status by the Arab
oil-producing countries while the Swiss franc was benefiting from a relatively
tight domestic liquidity situation. Intervention in French francs tended

III -5
to depress the franc against the dollar as perhaps $250 million equivalent
was supplied to the market as countervalue to intervention in guilders.
The Swiss franc turned easier on December 11 following an announcement
by the BNS that it was reducing the amount of required reserves to be
held at the central bank by 20 per cent over the year-end period. That,
on top of an earlier indication that it would supply some $1 billion
equivalent in Swiss francs through over-year-end swaps, sufficed to sub-
stantially ease the domestic liquidity situation.
The London gold price, after hovering in the low $90's for a while
following the termination of the March, 1968 agreement, suddenly shot up
over the $100 mark on November 28, and subsequently moved as high as $107.25
(fixing price) before easing a bit. The rise in the price of gold appeared
to be part of a general, steep rise in non-ferrous metals prices, perhaps
associated with fears of worldwide shortages and inflation expected to be
engendered by the energy crisis.
Euro-dollar market. Rates on Euro-dollar deposits of 1-month
maturity and more have increased considerably in the past four weeks,
continuing the upturn that began in early November. The 3-month rate
averaged about 10-3/4 per cent in the week of December 12, compared with
about 9-1/4 per cent in the last week of October. In large part the
increase has reflected rising short-term interest rates in the United
States; the 60-89 day CD rate, for example, has advanced one percentage
point in this period. The sharp rise in interest rates in Britain in
mid-November also put upward pressure on Euro-dollar rates; in addition,
the seasonal increase in demand for 1-month funds at the end of November

III -6
had a spillover effect on longer rates. In contrast to most Euro-dollar
rates, the overnight rate has moved up very little in the past month.
The excess of the 3-month Euro-dollar rate over the U.S. 60-
89 day CD rate has become larger in recent weeks, and has recently averaged
close to 1-1/4 percentage points. For banks subject to marginal reserve
requirements on CD's the cost of 3-month Euro-dollars now approximately
equals the cost of 60-89 day CD's even when the Euro-dollar borrowing
is not subject to the 8 per cent marginal reserve requirement. But in
the week of December 12 the excess of the Federal funds rate over the
cost of reserve-free overnight Euro-dollars averaged a bit more than four
weeks earlier, while the cost advantage of Fed funds relative to over-
night Euro-dollars subject to reserve requirements narrowed slightly in
this period. Currently, about $1 billion of net outstanding Euro-dollar
borrowings are subject to reserve requirements.
U.S. banks' gross liabilities to their foreign branches rose
from a daily average of $1.9 billion in the week of November 7 to $2.5
billion in the week of November 28, then dropped back to $2.2 billion
in the week of December 5.

U.S. balance of payments. The balance on the official settlements
basis is estimated to have been in surplus by about $2 billion in November
(not seasonally adjusted and not at an annual rate) and by about $88 million
in October. The large November surplus was accompanied by an appreciation
of about 5 percent in the average value of the dollar in terms of major
foreign currencies. Toward the end of November and the first week of December
there were sizable deficits in the official settlements balance, but these
stemmed mainly from dollar repayments by Japanese commercial banks to the
Japanese Ministry of Finance, which more than offset continued dollar sales
by the Bank of Japan. The large November surplus apparently reflects in
large part reflows from Japan, where the oil shortage looms as a major threat,
rather than a further improvement in the basic balance on current and long-
term capital transactions. In fact, that balance now is believed to have
registered a greater surplus in the third quarter than the $6 billion
annual rate indicated in the last Greenbook, and it may not be as large
in the current quarter.
Information on specific components of the balance of payments in
October and November is limited to trade and transactions in securities
and bank claims on foreigners. As indicated below, the U.S. trade showing
in September and October was the best in many years, with an average surplus
of over $6-1/2 billion at an annual rate in those months. A continued
large surplus is anticipated for the remaining months of the year.

III -9
On the other hand, there has been a sharp decline in net sales of
U.S. securities to foreigners. In October net sales of U.S. stocks to
foreigners were only $94 million, compared with average monthly sales of
$300 million in the third quarter. Brokers report continued net sales in
the first part of November but foreigners reportedly sold off stocks during
the last week of November. Sales of U.S. bonds to foreigners in October
were also substantially below the average monthly amount sold in the third
quarter despite a sharp pickup in sales of offshore Euro-bond issues by
U.S. corporations. At the same time U.S. purchases of foreign bonds
increased substantially in October, reflecting a heavy increase in offerings
by Israel and also by Canadian provinces.
Bank-reported claims on foreigners (including liquid claims)
increased by about $3/4 billion in October. The increase was about evenly
divided between U.S. commercial banks and U.S. agencies and branches of
foreign banks. Most of the increase in claims by U.S. commercial banks
consisted of export credits and Canadian assets, both of which are exempt
from the VFCR program. The increase in claims by foreign agencies was
largely in forms subject to the VFCR program, but was considerably less
than the increase in borrowings from abroad by those agencies, so that
they remained in compliance with the regulations instituted in June.
Preliminary data indicate that claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks
increased more slowly in November.

III -10
U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. trade position, which has shown
steady improvement since early 1973, strengthened further in September
and October as large surpluses were posted in each of these months. The
September-October average trade surplus of $6-1/2 billion at an annual rate,
balance-of-payments basis, represents the best trade showing for a two-
month period in the last 8 years. For the first ten months of 1973 the
trade balance was about zero, a dramatic turnaround from the $7 billion
trade deficit of calendar 1972.
The surpluses in September and October reflected improved trade
positions with both the developed and less-developed countries. Our trade
deficit with Japan, which has persisted for many years and totaled $4 billion
last year, virtually disappeared in these months as exports increased while
imports fell. The trade balance with Western Europe, which had shifted
from a deficit in 1972 to a sizable surplus in the first half of this
year, recorded a substantial further expansion in the surplus in September-
October as the advance in exports outpaced the rise in imports. A sharp
increase in shipments to Canada and little change in imports resulted
in a reduction in our trade deficit with that country.
With respect to the less-developed countries, the expansion in
our trade surplus with Latin America in September-October was particularly
noticeable as exports to that area rose very sharply. Despite the increase
in oil imports from Middle Eastern countries, our trade surplus with them
has changed very little in these recent months.

III -11
As indicated in the accompanying table, the further improvement
in the trade balance in September and October resulted from a continuing
large advance in the value of exports and a decline in the value of imports.

The commodity pattern of the expansion in exports in September-October has,
however, shifted from that of prior months. In the early part of the year,
the export advance was led by a sharp upturn in shipments of agricultural
commodities. The volume of such exports peaked in the first quarter, but
their value has continued to expand because of higher prices, especially

III -12
for wheat, rice and cotton. Currently deliveries of nonagricultural
commodities have taken the lead in the overall export expansion, and have
shown particularly sharp increases in recent months, mainly in volume rather
than price. Shipments of machinery and nonagricultural industrial materials
have been particularly strong. Foreign orders for machinery rose again in
October, following a dip in September, and the backlog has increased further.
Among industrial materials, there have been increasing exports of
chemicals, paper products, steel and nonferrous metals in recent months.
The price freeze of June followed by Phase IV in August has held domestic
prices for some products below world prices, making export markets more
attractive to domestic sellers. Consequently our customary net import
position in copper and aluminum has shifted into a net export position in
the last few months. In recognition of the tendency for these divergent
prices to reduce domestic supplies, the Cost of Living Council removed
price controls on copper scrap in July, on fertilizers in October and on
many nonferrous metals last week (early December). Another reason for the
recent acceleration in nonagricultural exports may have been the expectation
that the exchange rate of the dollar had reached its low point and that
U.S. goods were as cheap as they would get in term of foreign currencies.
The dollar has, in fact, been appreciating since July so that any stimulus
to net exports derived from exchange-rate changes may be diminished in the
future.

III -13
The strong growth in U.S. exports of nonagricultural commodities
this year has been accompanied by an improvement in the U.S. competitive
position in world trade. In the first half of 1973 (the latest period
for which data are available), the U.S. share of the volume of total world
trade in manufactured goods and in most major commodity categories rose
quite strongly.
Imports in September-October declined from the average level of
imports in the two preceding months, while import prices continued to rise.
The decline in value was moderated by a sharp rise in the volume and price
of fuel imports. The effects of the Arab embargo on oil exports to the
United States imposed in mid-October and the surge in oil prices from all
foreign sources will not begin to be reflected in the import figures until
November.
Aside from fuels, the quantity of imports has declined steadily
since the first quarter, and this decline appears to be broadly based among
the major import categories except for imports of capital equipment. The
rise in imports of capital equipment is of course associated with the
acceleration in fixed domestic investment expenditures this year. The fall
in the volume of imports of other finished goods -- nondurable consumer
goods, automobiles and other durable consumer goods -- may be attributable
in large part to the increasing effect of the dollar depreciations of the
past two years combined with some supply difficulties by foreign producers
as they attempted to meet strong internal demands and perhaps reorient
their foreign sales to non-U.S. markets.

III -14
Another major element in the declining volume of non-fuel imports
has been a very sharp fall in import of industrial materials. While there
has been a slackening in the rate of growth in domestic industrial pro-
duction, the decline in the volume of those imports has been greater than
would be expected from that slowdown. World-wide shortages of such goods
may partly explain these declines. The difficulty which domestic producers
have in passing on the rising cost of these foreign products, a difficulty
stemming from the Phase IV price controls (with relatively low base prices
from which cost increases have to justified), may be still another reason
for the weakness in such imports -- at least in recent months. Another
factor may have been the large sale of aluminum from Government stockpiles
this year which may have substituted for comparable imports. Through
September sales of aluminum from Government stocks totaled about 500,000
tons -- equivalent to about $250 million of imports. In 1972 there were
almost no sales of aluminum from Government stocks.
The outlook for a continued improvement in the trade position next
year is largely contingent on the effects of the energy crisis on production
here and abroad. A prolonged cutback in Arab oil production would probably
restrict the growth of industrial output to a greater extent in Japan and
Western Europe than in the United States. If output in Europe and Japan
declines relative to income and demand, these countries would experience
difficulty in exporting, and there would be some increase in their demand
for imports, mainly consumer goods or other products not directly used by
existing production facilities.

III -15
Given the likely "normal" demand for imported oil and the recent
increases in oil prices (which would have been only partly offset by an
induced decline in import volumes), the Arab embargo, if continued all next
year, would reduce potential U.S. imports in 1974 by perhaps $6 billion.
Even with the embargo, our oil import bill would rise by about $3 billion
from 1973 to 1974.

III -16
The impact of oil cutbacks on foreign industrial countries.
The background against which the cutbacks in oil supplies are taking
place is significantly different abroad than in the United States.
First, it had been expected that in most of Europe and, to a lesser
extent, in Japan and Canada, excess demand would persist at least
through mid-1974 -- even though output growth was expected to slow --
whereas aggregate demand in the United States was expected to become
relatively weak. Second, other industrial countries, though more
dependent than the United States on imported oil, had fairly large
stocks of oil and did not expect longer-run difficulties in satisfying
their rising demand for oil. In the United States, the Arab oil
embargo has come at a time when oil stocks were in any case relatively
low, and when imports of oil were counted on as a vital and rapidly
growing source of energy. Third, other industrial countries use much
higher proportions of oil than the United States for essential industrial
and other purposes.
Several conclusions can be drawn from these differences. The
heavier dependence abroad on Arab oil, especially for industry, sug-
gests that the impact of the cutbacks on economic activity will be more
severe in other countries than in the United States, even if shorter-
lived. And it suggests that other countries will not be able to
insulate their industrial sectors to the extent that the United States
may be able to do so. Then, in contrast to the United States, where

III -17
the shortages are expected to affect mainly aggregate demand, the
expected reduction in output in foreign industrial countries can be
viewed as stemming primarily from supply shortages. This will be
especially so if demand abroad is sustained by a general expectation
that the oil shortage will be only temporary.
An attempt has been made to give some quantitative feel to
the magnitude of the impact of oil cutbacks on foreign industrial out-
put. It has generally been assumed that (1) oil supplies from the
Middle East, excluding Libya, Algeria, Iran, and Iraq, will be cut by
20 per cent of September 1973 levels from November 1973 through June
1974, at which time supplies will revert to the September 1973 levels;
(2) alternative sources of oil supply will not be available in
significantly greater quantities; (3) major oil companies will tend
to divert non-Arab oil to ensure reasonably normal global distribution
patterns, although supplies to some countries (notably the Netherlands)
will be cut more than to others; (4) inventories of oil will be run
down only sparingly, given the uncertain duration of the shortages;
(5) given the time horizon assumed (i.e., only to mid-1974), there is
limited scope and incentive for adapting production techniques to
alternative sources of energy; and (6) some system of allocation will
be introduced in every country to try to insulate industry from the
cutbacks by cutting back more sharply on non-essential consumption of
oil.

III -18
Given these assumptions, and the data in Table 1, the follow-
ing kind of calculation was made for each country. The cutback in oil
available to industry was calculated, yielding an estimate of the total
energy cutback facing industry. Based on estimates of the relationship
between energy requirements and production, a first approximation to
the implied cutback in production was derived. Finally, this figure
was modified by considerations peculiar to each country, to yield the
estimates presented in Table 2. Abstracting in the first instance
from the effect of demand shortfalls, it has been estimated that
industrial production in the major foreign industrial countries will
on average be about 3-1/2 per cent lower in the first half of 1974 than
it would otherwise have been. That is, instead of increasing by 3-1/2
per cent, industrial production will remain virtually flat.
The general economic situation seems bleakest in the United
Kingdom, where the impact of the oil cutbacks is strongly exacerbated
by a myriad of labor disputes. These disputes involve notably the coal
miners and electrical power workers -- serious shortages of coal and
electric power have already developed -- but also railwaymen, dock-
workers, and workers in the chemical industry. Some industrial action
may be taken by engineers, as well.
Just in terms of the oil cutbacks themselves, however, the
impact is expected to be sharper in Japan than elsewhere. In part
this reflects Japan's relatively heavy reliance on petroleum as a

source of energy for the generation of electricity. It also reflects
the fact that the demand for energy had been expected to rise more
rapidly in Japan than elsewhere; since cutbacks are based on
September 1973 levels, the shortfall in oil supplies relative to
energy demand in 1974 will therefore be relatively great.
The Netherlands also will be affected rather more than others,
since the Dutch are in principle -- though apparently not in fact --
being cut off entirely from Arab oil. The embargo of the Dutch, in
turn, aggravates the situation in European countries who rely on
them for petroleum products -- particularly Germany. Half of Germany's
imports of refined petroleum, and a quarter of Germany's imports of crude
petroleum, normally come from the Netherlands.
France, along with the United Kingdom, is considered
"friendly" by the Arab countries, so that delieveries of Arab oil to
them will probably not be cut as much as deliveries to other countries.
Italy typically exports a large volume of refined petroleum products,
and the Italian Government has announced that they would cut these
exports to some extent to meet domestic requirements.
Canada, unlike the other major foreign industrial countries,
is not a net importer of crude petroleum. Crude petroleum is exported
from the Mid-western part of Canada and imported into the Eastern part.
Since a small amount of the imported oil comes from Arab countries
participating in the cutbacks, and some of the Venezuelan oil normally
imported may be diverted to the United States, oil shortages may develop

III -22
in Eastern Canada. However, the Government is trying to devise some
means of transporting oil from Western Canada to meet at least part
of this shortage. More significant from the point of view of Canadian
economic activity will be the impact of the expected slowdown in the
United States.
The estimates cited in Table 2 probably represent a fairly
optimistic assessment of the likely impact of the oil cutbacks on
foreign industrial output. Several factors could be operating to
yield a more severe impact. Even purely in terms of supply constraints,
on which the above estimates are primarily based, bottlenecks could well
occur in particular industries which would have serious repercussions
in other industries.
Equally important, there may be significant shortfalls in
demand. Specifically, demand shortfalls could occur in particular
industries -- such as the automobile, travel and hotel industries --
leading to pockets of unemployment and secondary income effects. More
generally, the increase in uncertainty caused by the oil cutbacks
could lead to sharply lower investment and consumer demand. The fall
in real income and wealth, derived both from higher oil prices and
from declines in the prices of equities, will tend to reinforce con-
sumers' hesitancy to spend.
Finally, recent information suggested that most policy-makers
abroad view the present situation as requiring continued restrictive

III -23
measures. A recent (and highly confidential) study prepared by the E.C.
Commission forecast that a 20 per cent shortfall in petroleum in relation
to current requirements would lead in 1974 to a 10 per cent reduction
in industrial production, a 2 to 3 per cent fall in real GNP, an increase
in the level of unemployment from 2 to 4-5 per cent, and an additional
1 to 1-1/2 per cent increase in the general price level. This forecast -
which takes account only of production decreases triggered directly by
supply limitations -- seems excessively gloomy, but it reinforces the
Commission's view that inflation still is the major policy issue facing
Community countries. If this view is adopted by national authorities,
demand reductions may combine with supply constraints to reduce the
growth of output further. In this connection, measures recently taken
by German authorities to encourage investment may be significant, al-
though German policy on balance remains quite restrictive.
The degree to which output is demand-constrained or supply-
constrained has an important bearing on the outlook for foreign trade,
in general, and U.S. trade in particular. If, as is generally assumed
here, supply constraints dominate in most foreign countries, excess
demand would spill over into a greater demand for imports, especially
of finished manufactured goods. Thus, the expectation that U.S. exports
of finished manufactured goods will not rise above previously forecast
levels is based on an assessment of limited U.S. ability or willingness
to supply them, rather than on the state of foreign demand.

III -24
The foreign demand for imports of industrial materials is even
more difficult to assess. As a first approximation, it may be argued
that the demand for industrial materials will be cut back in proportion
to the cutback in industrial production. On the other hand, it seems
likely that given the uncertainty about the duration of the oil shortage
firms may want to build up inventories of industrial materials to ensure
their availability when full production is resumed; the current rise in
prices of raw materials suggests that such hoarding may be taking place.
The demand for industrial materials would in this case not be reduced
so much, and supply constraints in the United States and elsewhere might
be the determinant of trade.
Supply constraints also affect foreign industrial countries'
ability to supply exports generally. Layoffs in the foreign automobile
industry seem to be related primarily to demand shortfalls abroad, so
that foreign automobile producers may be able to satisfy at least part
of a projected increase in U.S. demand for small cars. Other industries
abroad, however, may be supply-constrained to a greater extent. As a
rough guide, foreign exports might fall below previously projected levels
in about the same proportion as industrial production falls below pre-
viously projected levels. If authorities abroad take actions to ensure
that domestic production goes first to supply domestic users with only
a residual available for export (e.g., by the use of export controls,
as some countries have done in the case of petroleum products already),

III -25
the cutback in exports from foreign industrial countries could be cor-
respondingly higher. On the other hand, controls on prices for domestic
sales, such as those in force in the United Kingdom, tend to provide an
incentive to export products rather than to sell at home.
It should be noted that interrelationships among countries
are hardly taken into account in this analysis. Cutbacks in demand
and supply conditions in one country can have strong repercussions on
other countries, in terms of domestic output (and prices) and even more
pronounced effects in terms of trade. Differences among countries in
supply and demand conditions in particular industries may also be im-
portant, and may greatly disrupt normal trading patterns.
Finally, no account has been taken of possible difficulties
in world shipping. If the supply of bunker fuel is reduced and poorly
distributed, the volume of world trade will be reduced, with some
countries being disproportionately affected, unless countries quickly
cooperate to ease the situation. Difficulties with shipping are re-
portedly already important for Japan.
