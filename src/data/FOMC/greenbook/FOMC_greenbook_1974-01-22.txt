Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The energy crisis added to other factors dampening growth in
economic activity in the fourth quarter. Real GNP is estimated to have
increased at an annual rate of only 1 per cent, rather than the 2 per
ceht expected five weeks ago. For nominal GNP, staff estimates now
indicate a rise of $28 billion--compared with $29 billion in the December
Greenbook--but price increases have been even more rapid than anticipated
and we are now estimating an increase of close to 8 per cent, annual
rate, in the implicit GNP deflator.
Weakness in the fourth quarter was especially evident in
consumer purchases of goods and services, which apparently increased at
an annual rate of only 6 per cent while the price deflator for personal
consumption expenditures rose at a rate of over 8 per cent. Unit sales
of autos were down appreciably,and real purchases of some nondurables--
particularly gas, oil and food--also declined. Residential construction
expenditures were off sharply in both nominal and real terms. Business
fixed investment increased moderately while inventory investment
accelerated, in part because of a substantial build-up of dealer stocks
of large cars.
Industrial production is estimated to have declined 0.5 per
cent in December because of a sharp decline in auto output and reduced
use of electricity and gas, mainly by residential and commercial cus-
tomers. Materials output was little changed, while the increase in
business equipment was moderate.

I -2
The labor market also showed some weakening in December.
Payroll employment increased little and the unemployment rate moved up
further to 4.9 per cent. The energy crisis was reflected in layoffs
at automobile dealers, gas stations, hotels, and some other activities.
Unemployment claims have risen sharply since the total unemployment
survey was taken in early December.
Business plans for spending on fixed capital have changed
relatively little. The recent Commerce Survey indicates an increase
of 12 per cent for 1974, somewhat less than reported by earlier private
surveys, but the Commerce Survey was taken too early to reflect fully
the effects of the energy crisis on spending plans. New orders for non-
defense capital goods in November continued to increase faster
than in the third quarter.
Wage rates increased at a rapid pace in December. For the
fourth quarter as a whole, the adjusted hourly earnings index increased
at an annual rate of 7 per cent, about the same as over the preceding
two quarters. Nonetheless, real spendable earnings per worker continued
to decline.
Wholesale prices of industrial products increased 2.6 per
cent further in December. Prices of petroleum and products--and of
other fuels--were a major factor in the sharp rise, but price advances
were widespread among other commodities, which rose about 1 per cent on
average. Prices of farm products and foods rose on average after
several months of decline. In November, consumer prices had risen
sharply further to a level almost 8-1/2 per cent above a year earlier.

1-3
Outlook, Information becoming available since the December
Greenbook has led the staff to modify its earlier assumptions about
the severity of the oil shortage. The short-fall of oil supplies in 1974
is now assumed to amount to 2 -2-1/2 million barrels per day, rather
than 3-1/2 million. At the same time, prices of petroleum products are
now expected to increase more than the staff anticipated five weeks ago.
Thus, in the year ending in the fourth quarter of 1974, we are now
assuming an increase of about 40 per cent (rather than 30 per cent) in
the price of gasoline, with most of the increase taking place early in
1974.
The staff has also incorporated the following assumptions in
the 1974 GNP projections: (1) Short-term interest rates will remain
relatively close to recent levels. (2) This interest rate assumption
would probably be associated with growth in M1 over the year as a whole
of around 6 per cent, but there is more than the usual uncertainty about
the strength of money demand under present circumstances. (3) The
fiscal policy assumptions remain essentially as before; the President's
budget message is scheduled for release January 28. (4) The staff
continues to assume gradual decontrol of prices and wages over the months
ahead.
The projected rate of price increase has been raised in the
first half of this year, with larger advances for petroleum products,
and to a lesser extent for foods, accounting for most of the revision.
Despite large increases in nominal expenditures, real consumer takings
are expected to be quite weak in the first half. However, with more

1-4
gasoline assued to be available fbi cohsMuter use, along with a more
rapid coversion of facilities to production of smaller autos than had
earlier appeared feasible, the decline in unit auto sales may be some-
what less than projected earlier.
Another major change is in imports, which are now expected to
rise much more sharply than earlier in view of the marked increases that
have occurred in prices of crude petroleum. Primarily as a result of
this change, net exports of goods and services are now projected to be
in deficit throughout this year.
Altogether, real GNP is still projected to decline somewhat
in the first half of 1974 and to increase at a relatively slow pace in
the second half. Under these circumstances, the unemployment rate is
expected to rise throughout 1974, reaching about 6 per cent by the end
of the year. The private fixed-weight price index is now expected to
rise at an annual rate of 7-1/2 per cent in the first half, almost a
full percentage point more than last time.

Industrial production. Industrial production declined one-
half per cent in December because of a sharp cutback in auto output
and reduced use of electricity and gas, mainly by residential and
commercial users, Excluding motor vehicles and parts, and electric
and gas utilities, the index increased slightly. The total index, at
126.6 per cent of the 1967 average, was 4.5 per cent above a year
earlier.
Auto assemblies in December were at an annual rate of 8.2
million units, down 14.6 per cent from November. Preliminary January
output schedules indicate a further decline of about 15 per cent.
Production of other consumer durable goods was off slightly in December
as output of some household appliances declined. Nondurable consumer
goods, excluding electric and gas utilities, also edged off. Output
of business equipment rose0.4 per cent further to a new high, 11.5
per cent above a year earlier. Production of construction products
and steel and other durable and nondurable materials were maintained
at advanced levels.

Retail sales. Retail sales were weak in the closing months
of last year. December sales declined 1.3 per cent from November and
the fourth quarter as a whole averaged only 0.7 per cent above the
third quarter. Much of the recent weakness is attributable to the
automotive group, where sales were down both in December and the
fourth quarter.
Excluding autos and nonconsumption items, sales in December
increased 0.9 per cent from November. Nondurable goods were up 1.3 per
cent, with general merchandise up 2.4 per cent and food up 0.6 per cent.
In contrast, sales at gasoline stations were off 1.2 per cent--the
second month-to-month decline--and furniture and appliances were 3.2 per
cent lower than in November.

Unit sales of consumer durables. December sales of new
domestic-type autos dropped to a 7.9 million unit annual rate, 9
per cent below the preceding two months and substantially below
December last year. Sales in the first 10 days of January weakened
further to a 7.4 million annual rate. Small car sales in December
continued strong, reaching a record 36 per cent of the domestic-type
market, up sharply from 22 per cent a year earlier, For the fourth
quarter as a whole, unit sales were down 17 per cent from the third
quarter. Despite this end-of-year weakness, sales of domestic-type
cars totaled a record 9.7 million units for 1973 as a whole.
Stocks of domestic-type autos rose to a 69 days' supply at
the end of December as compared with a 65 days' supply a month earlier.
The available supply of cars was not only large but also unbalanced
as the days' supply was approximately double that for small cars.
Foreign car sales in December were at a 1.7 million unit
annual rate, the same as November, and for the year totaled a record
1.8 million units. Combined auto sales for 1973 were 11.4 million
units, 5 per cent above the previous high in 1972.
Truck sales in December were at a 3.0 million unit annual
rate, slightly above November and 18 per cent above December 1972.
For 1973 as a whole, a record 3.0 million units were sold.
Factory sales of major home appliances, TVs, and radios
in the first three weeks of December were somewhat above November and

I -14
about the same as December a year earlier. Factory sales of major
appliances showed a sharp jump in December, led by strong sales of
air conditioners and refrigerators while TV sales were about equal
to those of a month earlier.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturing and trade inventories
rose at close to a $38 billion annual rate in November (p)--up from the
downward revised $25 billion October rate. A large proportion of this
increase reflected the revaluation of stocks at higher prices.

October. Automobile inventories grew at an annual rate of $6-1/2
billion in November, up $1 billion from the October rate. In November,
stocks of nondurables rose at about twice the October rate. Whole-
sale inventories rose considerably more in November than in October;
the major part of the November rise was in farm products and at
groceries and liquor dealers and was mainly attributable to price
increases.

Of the eight leading series available for November, those

permits. The average workweek in manufacturing was unchanged,
Of the indicators available for December, common stock
prices were down and the average workweek in manufacturing was

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place edged lower in December from the upward
revised November rate. The decline reflected the continued slowdown
in outlays for private residential construction, which were 14 per cent
below the February peak. Private nonresidential construction expenditures
remained at the recent record rate, and outlays for public construction
continued moderately above their mid-1973 low. For 1973 as a whole
outlays totaled $135 billion, 9 per cent above 1972. After adjustment
for cost increases, however, total expenditures changed little from
a year earlier.

Seasonally adjusted sales of new single-family homes by
merchant builders rose 4 per cent in November, but were still slightly
below the third quarter average and a fourth below the last quarter
of 1972. The number of unsold new homes edged down from its recent
high, but continued close to 10 months' supply at the current sales
rate. The median price of new homes for sale rose only slightly.
Sales of existing homes continued lower than a year earlier but the
median price of such units, at $29,950, was 10 per cent higher.

Residential construction and home sales are expected to
decline further into the first half of 1974, according to several large
residential builders interviewed recently. They note that prospective
home buyers--especially those concerned about potential gasoline
rationing or their employment prospects, as well as others anticipating

I -19a
further reductions in mortgage interest rates--appear to be delaying
purchases at this time of general seasonal slack in the market. Despite
unusual uncertainties, most of the builders still plan to operate on
the basis of the pre-fuel shortage outlook, which--it should be stressed--
typically allowed for significant reductions in the number of housing
starts in 1974.
Shortages of home-heating fuels have been a problem for
many builders for more than a year. Given the present concern about
the availability of heating oil, the shift toward electric heating--adding
$500 to $1,000 in unit costs--will increase. Partly reflecting the
reduced level of construction activity, building material shortages
did not seem to be a major concern at this time, although some
builders noted that deliveries of certain petroleum-based and other
products have continued to be delayed.

I -20
Anticipated plant and equipment spending. The ~ommerce
Department's annual survey -- taken in late November and early December --
indicated that businesses were planning a 12 per cent increase in
fixed capital outlays for 1974 as compared with a 13.2 per cent gain
now estimated for 1973. The survey for 1974 indicates that
manufacturers intended to increase spending by 16.8 per cent for the
year, with durable and nondurable producers each planning about the
same increase. Prospective increases were particularly strong.in
primary metals, motor vehicles, paper and petroleum industries, while
cutbacks from 1973 levels were planned in textiles. Outside of
manufacturing a 9.1 per cent gain is expected during 1974, with
sizable advances anticipated by public utilities and railroads, but
with airlines planning to reduce their capital outlays.
There are some differences between the Commerce survey
and earlier private surveys for 1974. Although some plans may have
been revised because of the energy crisis, the Commerce Department
stresses it is still too early to assess the impact of the oil
embargo on spending plans. The various survey results may also differ
because of different sample sizes and response rates.

Labor market. The labor market in recent weeks has shown
some signs of softening. The unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage
points further in December, while payroll employment increased only a
little from the upward revised November level. Initial and continuing
claims for insured unemployment benefits also have tended upward in
recent weeks. Employment reductions which appear to be due to actual
or anticipated shortages of gasoline occurred in several industries --
particularly automotive dealerships, service stations, hotels and

I -22
entertainment activities. Layoffs in the auto industry, however,
occurred after the reporting week for the establishment employment
survey. Preliminary estimates suggest a cumulative total of about
90,000 energy-related initial claims for unemployment benefits since
the beginning of December, the majority since the establishment survey
reporting week.
The unemployment rate moved up in the past two months --
reaching 4.9 per cent in December after dropping to a 3-1/2 year low
of 4.5 per cent in October. A large part of the December increase in
joblessness occurred among female workers -- particularly those 18-24
years of age; since October, however, rates for nearly all groups
are up significantly. Over the past two months the labor force
increased only moderately following a very sharp rise in the early
fall.

Nonfarm payroll employment continued to grow rapidly through
November--averaging 240,000 pet month, about the same as in 1972& But
growth in payroll employment slowed in December. There were substantial
job gains in December in construction--partly due to unseasonable warm
weather--as well as in State and local government; and manufacturing
employment edged up by 25,000 with scattered small advances. But these
increases were largely offset by declines in private service activities--
especially retail trade. The factory workweek remained unchanged at
40.7 hours, but overtime edged off 0.1 hour to 3.7 hours.

EarningSd The average hourly earnings index for private
nonfarm productioh workers rose ahatpiy in December, following some
slowing earlier in the fall, and in the fourth quarter as a whole the
index was up at a 7 per cent annual rate. The index rose at a 7.2
per cent annual rate in the last three quarters of 1973, compared with
6,5 per cent over the four quarters of 1972. The most rapid accelera-
tion in the pace of wage increases has been in services and trade.
But despite the accelerated pace of earnings increases, rising prices
have completely eroded the purchasing power of take home pay for the
individual worker, Real spendable earnings declined throughout 1975,
following a substantial rise in the preceding year.

Collective bargaining. The 1974 collective bargaining schedule
is heavy with at least 5-1/4 million workers covered by major contracts
that either expire or contain wage reopening provisions, compared with
4-3/4 million workers under contracts settled last year. This year's
total does not include workers who may push for contract reopenings
because of the energy crisis or recent and prospective rapid price in-
creases. For example, the Teamsters Union, representing 350,000 workers,
has asked for a contract reopening to protect the present level of earn-
ings for truck drivers affected by fuel shortages.
In addition, about 4-3/4 million workers are scheduled to
receive deferred increases which are estimated to average about 5 per
cent--slightly more than in 1973. These deferred raises do not include
cost-of-living adjustments which will depend on changes in the CPI in
1974. More than 4 million workers are covered by such escalator clauses.
The scheduled bargaining will center in several key, pattern-
setting industries: basic steel, can, aluminum, longshore, telephone,
railroad, coal, and aerospace. In addition, an estimated 2 million
construction workers will bargain this year--an unusually heavy schedule
which primarily reflects the short contracts negotiated under the Con-
struction Industry Stabilization Committee's wage control program.
Negotiations in the steel industry will be influenced by the
1973 no-strike agreement which guarantees workers minimum wage increases

I -26
of 3 per cent in 1974, 1975, and 1976, although greater increases can
be negotiated. Workers will continue to be covered by a cost-of-living
clause with no maximum limit and a 12.5 cent minimum in the second
and third contract years. In addition, national issues unresolved at
the time of contract expiration will be settled by an arbitration panel,
although the right to strike over local plant issues is retained. How-
ever, such limited actions would not be expected to disrupt steel
production significantly.
Traditionally the steel settlement has been influenced by
the contracts reached earlier in the auto, aluminum and can industries
although what effect the new steel agreement will have on this pattern
is not known. The aluminum industry will begin bargaining three months
early in an attempt to reach agreement well before contract expiration.
Since their current contract contains clauses similar to those accepted
as a minimum basic settlement in the steel industry, there seems to be
little likelihood of industry-wide strikes this year.
Of the remaining negotiations, the longshoremen and the coal
miners are likely to be the most militant in their demands. The long-
shore settlement was reached in 1972 after a long strike and the
negotiated wage increases were reduced by the Pay Board. As a result,
there is likely to be some pressure for a sizable settlement. The
Mine Workers, under the leadership of a new president, have already

I -27
announced their intention of seeking a large settlement. Mine owners
may be under additional pressure to avoid a strike, because of the
energy crisis.

Consumer prices. Consumer prices continued to rise in
November at a 10 per cent annual rate, seasonally adjusted, with further
sharp increases for gasoline and oil and a large advance for food. The
12-month rise from November 1972 was 8.4 per cent, the largest since
1951. Service costs increased substantially, although less than food
and other commodities.

Food prices rose--despite declines for meat, poultry and
eggs--mainly because of continued sharp increases in prices of dairy,
cereal and bakery productsand processed fruits and vegetables.
Between August and November, prices of cereal and bakery products rose
17 per cent, and dairy products, 12 per cent (not annual rates). From
November 1972 the advance for cereal and bakery products was as large
as for meats--27 per cent.
The drop in livestock prices from August through November
was reflected only in part at retail as margins continued high, particu-
larly for beef. According to preliminary (confidential) USDA estimates,
the fourth-quarter spread between retail prices and farm value of beef
was more than 80 per cent above its 1967 level and more than 25 per cent
above the average of the previous three quarters. If the spread had
remained at about this previous 1973 average (already nearly 45 per cent
above 1967), retail beef prices in the fourth quarter would have been
reduced by 10 cents or more. This suggests that much of the recent
resurgence of cattle prices could be absorbed.
Sharp price rises for gasoline and, particularly, fuel oil
boosted the index for other commodities, as in October, and further
large advances occurred in December and, especially, January. If not
for these extraordinary increases, prices of nonfood commodities would
have risen in November at, roughly, half the actual annual rate of 9
per cent and the rate of rise in the "All items" index would have been
about 8 per cent rather than 10 per cent.

I -30
Used car prices fell further in November and those of new
cars were unchanged, after seasonal adjustment. In December the
index may begin to reflect the increases announced after the December
10 COLC decision decontrolling auto prices. However, the CPI may
understate the advance this year, since standard and intermediate-
sized cars, for which prices were raised less than the average, are
strongly represented in the BLS sample.
Mortgage costs contributed less to the advance in service
prices than in the previous three months, but residential gas rates
rose sharply.

I -31
Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose 2.2 per cent in
December (29.6 per cent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate) mainly
as a result of widespread price increases for industrial commodities.
However, there was also a large increase in the prices of farm products
and foods--following three months of declines--and this accounted for
about one-fifth of the latest increase in the overall WPI.

Price increases for fuels, which contributed about 60 per
cent to the increase in the index of industrial commodities from

to December 1973, were also of major importance in the rise in prices
for both materials and nonfood finished goods.
Further increases in indexes of prices of petroleum can be
expected because of higher prices for foreign oil, the one dollar
increase in the price of controlled domestic crude oil permitted by
the Cost-of-Living Council on December 19, and other increases for
refined products recently announced by oil companies as a result of
higher costs of crude oil which are permitted to be passed through in
accordance with government regulations. Prices of nonferrous metals
may also rise somewhat further as a result of the elimination of price
controls over some nonferrous metals and the easing of controls on
others.
In December, prices of farm products and foods rose 1.4 per
cent (17.9 per cent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate). The
December-to-December increase of 26.7 per cent was the largest since
the inception of this series in 1947, although more rapid annual
rates were reported for several individual months earlier in 1973.
Increases over the year are shown below for some selected groups of

Agriculture Prices received by farmers increased 1-1/2 per
cent during the month ending December 15. Prices for milk, eggs, grain,
soybeans, and cotton contributed to the rise and have advanced still
further by mid-January. After a four-month decline, cattle and hog
prices also moved up in January. An upturn had been expected but the
sharpness of the rise (for cattle, 20 per cent in two weeks ending
January 11) was surprising.
A drop in red meat and poultry production from November to
December resulted mainly from lower hog and broiler slaughter, down
3 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. More recently a decline in
cattle slaughter has developed and is having increasing impact on
prices. Low feedlot inventories will keep beef supplies low for
several months. While placements of cattle on feed increased 5 per
cent in November, after a four month decline, they were still 15 per
cent below average monthly placements in 1972 and early 1973.
Sales of major grains reported through December 30 indicate
exports will be 10 per cent greater in the 1973-1974 crop year than
last year. Carryover stocks of food and feed grains will likely fall
well below 1973 levels. Prospective wheat stocks are the lowest in
25 years and this is a major factor in the high prices which are
disturbing U.S. bakers.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Corporate financing patterns and international financial
flows have influenced changes in the structure of interest rates since
the last Committee meeting, A pick-up in the pace of current and
prospective capital market borrowing by both financial and nonfinancial
corporations, as well as the larger volume of State and local bond
offerings, contributed to upward yield adjustments in all bond markets
of 15 to 30 basis points. Short-term market yields were subject to
cross-currents. In the Treasury bill market, yields rose about 50
basis points, while yields on private short-term instruments declined
by as much as 25 basis points before beginning to edge up most recently.
The decline in private short-term yields apparently reflected
the shifting in corporate financing patterns from short- to long-term
markets, as well as the market reinvestment by corporations and other
investors of dollar balances obtained from sales of foreign exchange.
Treasury bill rates, on the other hand, were under upward pressure in
reflection of foreign official sales of bills to finance their exchange
support operations. Also, the market appears to have become more un-
certain as to current and prospective monetary policy, with the
Federal funds rate apparently declining less than expected. Most
recently, the rising level of bill rates has contributed to a reversal
of the decline in other short-term market yields.
Total bank loan expansion in December was unusually modest as
potential borrowers shifted to capital markets. However, banks did
continue to acquire mortgages at a relatively rapid rate, although

II -2
below the pace of earlier this y&ars and with inflows continuing to
improve margfially at the thrift institutions new home tottgage commit-
ments probably rose further in December,
Outlook. Barring an unexpected run-off of foreign holdings
of special issues, the Treasury is not expected to require any new
funds until March, and then only about $1 billion. Agency financing
needs also appear likely to moderate further in line with the improved
financial position of the thrift institutions. While the oil embargo
and price decisions regarding crude petroleum still remain factors of
considerable uncertainty in real and financial markets, total private
credit demands are expected to moderate over the winter and spring as
real economic activity slows. The drop-off in such credit demands is
likely to be most marked in consumer and mortgage markets.
The outlook for financing needs is not all one-sided, however.
The projected increase in inventory accumulation and plant and equip-
ment outlays at a time of weakening profits outside the oil industry,
indicates an increasing need for external financing by nonfinancial
corporations. Businesses appear to be planning to continue to meet
an expanding share of this financing in the capital market, reducing t
their demands on banks and the commercial paper market. This financing
pattern will tend to maintain upward interest rate pressures in bond
markets. But, unless the Federal funds rate declines, reduced short-
term credit demands are unlikely to be reflected in more than marginal
declines in short-term market yields.
At current interest rates, net inflows of consumer-type time
and savings deposits to banks and thrift institutions are expected to

II -3
be well maintained, despite considerable certificate maturities this
quarter at savings and loan associations. While these institutions
are projected to continue to build liquidity and also to repay loans
to the FHL Banks, they can be expected to become more willing lenders
in the home mortgage market. Greater availability of mortgage finance
coupled with reduced demands by builders and buyers generated by
general economic conditions should result in downward pressure on
mortgage rates. Indeed, with 8-1/2 per cent FHA/VA mortgages currently
selling at close to par in the secondary market, some reduction in
the administratively-determined FHA/VA contract rate now seems possible.
Monetary aggregates. Growth in the major monetary aggregates
slowed somewhat in December from the rapid pace in November, with
inflows of both private demand balances and time deposits other than
CD's moderating. (No data on the monetary aggregates are shown here
because the final stage of revisions for 1973, which incorporate new
benchmarks, has not been completed. Preliminary estimates of the
new aggregate data will be provided in the Greenbook Supplement.)
December M1 growth was higher than it otherwise would have
been as a result of a late December bulge in deposits held by foreign
commercial banks at large U.S. banks. This increase appears to reflect
a temporary interruption of normal withdrawals on two successive
reporting days--the day after Christmas and the day after New Year's--
when U.S. banks were open, but certain European banks, including all
British banks, were closed.-/ In the absence of this special factor,
J/ These two dryc were Wednecdays, the reporting day for the weekly
reporting bank series. These single-day data are the only source
of information on foreign bank deposits at U.S. banks and are used
to estimate the weekly averages.

II -4
M1 growth in December would have been only slightly higher than October's
rate of around 6 per cent.
After two months of decline, banks increased their outstanding
large CD's in December by about $800 million on a monthly average basis,
with maturities of new issues still very short. Some of this turnaround
may have reflected a more aggressive stance by banks in the CD market
because of the slower growth of other deposits and the reduction of
marginal reserve requirements on CD's effective December 13. However,
there are also reports that domestic sellers of foreign exchange were
anxious to find short-term investments for their dollar balances and
actively sought CD's,
The turnaround in outstanding CD's offset the slower growth
of other deposits and a decline in U.S. Government deposits. Con-
sequently the adjusted bank credit proxy increased at the highest rate
since August. The growth in the proxy, however, still remained low
compared to the early months of 1973.
Bank credit. In December, for the fourth consecutive month,
total loans and investments of all commercial banks (last-Wednesday-of-
the-month series, seasonally adjusted) showed sharply reduced growth.
While total loans expanded at the slowest rate in three years, con-
sumer and real estate loans grew at rates near those of recent months.
In 1973 the moderation of bank acquisition of mortgages was considerably
less than in previous periods of monetary restraint, reflecting the
continued ability of banks to attract deposits and the attractive
yields available on mortgages.

r/ Revised,
The modest business loan expansion in December was not, as in
September and October, reflective of borrower shifting to the commer-
cial paper market to take advantage of lower borrowing rates. Relative
rates made commercial bank loans attractive to borrowers, and though
outstanding dealer-placed commercial paper is estimated to have dropped
slightly over the month, bank loans increased only moderately.
The deceleration in the growth of short-term business credit
appears to reflect mainly repayments from the proceeds of the increased
pace of capital market financing by nonfinancial corporations in
November and December.-/ It is unlikely that much of the slowdown in
short-term credit demands is as yet associated with resource limitations
stemming from the energy crisis. In fact, loans to petroleum refiners
jumped in December, in part related to the financing of purchases of
oil leases.

The continued liquidation of Treasury securities at commercial
banks (on a seasonally adjusted basis), which occurred throughout the
second half, reflects in part the modest volume of Treasury financing
over the period, Banks typically underwrite a substantial portion of
new issues, and our seasonal factors for bank holdings of Government
securities anticipate such financing. But while the smaller volume
of new Treasury issues contributed to a reduction in bank acquisitions
of such securities, banks did step up the purchase of other securities
in December--mostly municipals.
Nonbank financial institutions.
Deposit flows into nonbank thrift institutions were moderately
stronger in December than in the previous month, according to prelim-
inary data. This added strength reflects primarily the larger than
seasonal volume of interest credited at the end of December due to the
higher rates paid on deposits since Regulation Q changes in July,
Interest credited accounted for the bulk of the unadjusted increase
at S&L's and--according to confidential NAMSB estimates--all of the
increase at MSB's.
1/ Repayment of bank loans from capital market borrowing by finance
companies also contributed to the weakness of loans to nonbank
financial institutions, which are not included in business loans.

II -6a
FHLBank net advances to S&L's picked up in December, totaling
approximately $300 million, as compared with $60 million in November.
The December increase, however, was less than seasonal, and mainly
reflected borrowing late in the month in anticipation of reinvestment
period withdrawals. At the same time, with takedowns of mortgage
commitments seasonally slack, S&L's reportedly continued to add to
their liquid asset positions.

Policy loan activity at life insurance companies, which peaked
in AugUst showed a further drop in November, with the net increase in
policy loan holdings the smallest since June, Acquisitions of mortgages
and securities by life insurance companies have been strong in recent
months, but the pace of new commitment activity has declined,
Consumer credit. Consumer credit outstanding increased in
November at about the same seasonally adjusted rate as in October, but
the rise in noninstalment debt was less than half as large. As a result,
the annual rate of increase in total consumer credit outstanding declined
to less than $23 billion, 9 per cent below October and more than 12 per
cent below the peak in the fourth quarter of 1972,
Components of the instalment credit total showed a mixed
pattern during November, A further rise in bank credit-card extensions,
which were more than one-third above a year earlier, led to a record
increase in nonautomotive consumer goods credit, On the other hand,
lower extensions for auto buying reduced the monthly gain in automobile
credit outstanding to the smallest total since April 1972.
The increase in bank credit-card volume has enabled commercial
banks to enlarge their share of the instalment credit market in recent
months, despite the substantial decline in new car financing--their most
important sector, During October and November banks accounted for 43.3
per cent of total instalment credit extensions, an increase of more than
1 percentage point, on average, from the earlier quarters of 1973.
Commercial banks now hold more than one-half of outstanding consumer
instalment indebtedness.

II -9
The rise in finance rates on new car contracts purchased by
finance companies slowed in October and November, New car rates rose
6 basis points in each of those months following an average monthly
increase of more than 11 basis points in the third quarter, The current
level of rates--12,4 per cent--is about 50 basis points above a year
earlier, The shift to a larger mix of small car sales has been reflected
in a reduced average instalment contract size, Despite substantial
price increases on the 1974 models, the weighted average amount financed,
excluding finance charges, declined nearly $50 in November to $3,400,
the lowest point since August,
Commercial paper outstanding, In December, commercial paper
outstanding declined an estimated $400 million on a seasonally adjusted
basis, reflecting reductions in both bank-related and nonbank-related
paper. Between mid-November and late December, the cost to the borrower
of issuing dealer-placed paper gradually approached and then exceeded
the bank prime rate, thus accounting for the decline in outstandings,
The $200 million decline in nonbank directly placed paper was accounted
for entirely by a shift of one finance company subsidiary of an auto-
motive manufacturer from commercial paper(which has a maximum maturity
of 270 days)to 13-15 month notes.
The relatively attractive interest costs on dealer placed paper
during October and the first half of November, in large part, accounted
for the substantial growth in total commercial paper during the fourth
quarter ($3,3 billion). For the year as a whole, large increases in
both bank-related and nonbank directly placed paper as well as modest

II -10
growth in nonbank dealer placed paper resulted in an increase in total
commercial paper outstanding of $6.4 billion, the largest annual rise
since 1969.

Short-term interest rates. Yields on short-term debt obliga-
tions have shown mixed changes over the inter-meeting period. Private
rates generally have remained unchanged or declined 1/8 of a percentage
point, whereas Treasury bill yields have advanced about 1/2 of a per-
centage point.
Bill rates had been under downward pressure at the time of the
December FOMC meeting, The December 7 reduction in marginal reserve
requirements and a sizable volume of Desk reserve injections apparently
had fueled expectations of a significant near-term drop in the funds
rate resulting from an easing in monetary policy. More recently,
however, this outlook has been reassessed in view of the relatively
rapid November-December growth in the monetary aggregates and the
stability of the funds rate around 9-3/4 per cent. In addition, the
continuing need for foreign central banks to liquidate Treasury securi-
ties to obtain dollars has raised questions about the near-term outlook
for bill rates. In this changed atmosphere, the sizable penalty rates
at which dealers have had to finance security inventories have exerted
upward pressure on Treasury bill rates, pushing the quote on the 3-month
issue, for example, toward 8 per cent.
Private short-term rates also declined in mid-December, and
in contrast to bill rates they declined somewhat further in early
January. Most recently, however, they too have started to back up.
While private rates often lag somewhat behind bill rates, this divergent
behavior may also reflect some weakening in business demands for
short-term credit, as well as the reinvestment of dollars recently

II -12
acquired from foreign central banks., The reduced rate of around 9-1/8
per cent on 3-month commercial paper during the latter half of December
induced most banks that "float" their prime rate to lower that rate by
1/4 percentage point, thus falling into line with the more prevalent
9-3/4 per cent rate.
Later this month the Treasury must set refunding terms for
the roll-over of $4.5 billion of publicly held issues maturing in
February. Assuming no further liquidation of foreign special issues
between now and the receipt of March income taxes, the Treasury might
still need to borrow an additional $1 billion of net new money to cover
the seasonal low point in its cash balance around mid-March--particu-
larly if Congress fails to reinstitute the Treasury's special over-
draft privilege at the Federal Reserve before then. While the Treasury
may want to raise this modest amount of new money in conjunction with
the refinancing, the operation could be delayed until late February
or early March. In any event, it will have to raise additional new
money--perhaps $3 billion--to cover the low point in the balance just
prior to receipt of April income taxes.
In the Agency market, as a result of recently expanded deposit
inflows to thrift institutions, the Federal Home Loan Banks and FNMA
have again lowered their January-June 1974 borrowing plans. It now
appears that Agency borrowing and asset sales over this period may
amount to only $4.8 billion, or about $2.5 billion below the amounts
expected earlier.

Long-term securities markets, Long-term rates have risen
moderately, on balance, since the December FOMC meeting, with the
largest advance--about 30 basis points--occurring on Government bonds.
Advances in bond yields, which occurred despite the usual decline in
flotations during the period surrounding the end of the year, appear to
have reflected investor adjustment to the prospective heavy supply of
offerings early in 1974 along with disappointment over progress in
controlling inflation.

Stock prices, which had declined sharply throughout November
because of the prospective energy shortage and related developments,
have fluctuated widely since then with a small net advance from the
recent low reached on December 5. Immediately following the Board's
announcement of a reduction in margin requirements effective January 3,
the Dow-Jones Industrial average rose 25 points in active trading. But
after this brief flurry, prices declined on balance and at mid-January
were a little below their year-end levels.
Neither the recent back-up in interest rates nor uncertainties
about the economy and the availability of fuel have had much discernible
effect on corporate financing plans. In December total corporate
security offerings declined less than seasonally from their high
November level and remained appreciably above the monthly average for
the first three quarters of 1973. In January and February total corporate
security offerings are expected to average about 15 per cent larger
than the relatively high fourth quarter rate.
All of the forecasted rise in corporate security financing is
attributable to increased public bond offerings. In January, the volume
of such issues is expected to total $2.5 billion--the highest level
since March 1971--and the calendar suggests that February will show only
a moderate decline from this amount. The bulk of the increased financing
is accounted for by banks and other financial firms as well as manu-
facturing corporations, with part of the proceeds indicated to be used
for repayment of short-term debt.

The volume of municipal bond offerings in January and February
is expected to average more than one tenth above the average monthly
level in 1973 and about the same as in 1972. Growth in State and local
financing is associated with increased amounts of special revenue bond
issues and industrial pollution control financing. Corporate financing
in the tax-exempt market totaled about $1.8 billion last year and is
expected to be considerably larger in 1974.

II -17
Mortgage market, Seasonally adjusted net mortgage debt forma-
tion slowed markedly during the fourth quarter of 1973 and was about one-
third below the peak $20 billion first-quarter increase, according to
preliminary estimates. Commercial banks accounted for the largest
single share (about one-fourth) of total net mortgage debt expansion
in the quarter as the share for savings and loan associations dropped
further. The share accounted for by Federal credit agencies also
declined, due mainly to slower growth in net FHLBank advances and a
reduction in GNMA's mortgage holdings.
In December, new mortgage commitment activity at insured
savings and loan associations is estimated to have picked up somewhat
further on a seasonally adjusted basis, the third consecutive monthly
increase from the recent low. The stock of S&L mortgage commitments
outstanding (including loans in process), which had been declining for
nearly a year, apparently changed little in December and at year-end was
about 27 per cent below the February peak.
Interest rates on new commitments for conventional home mort-
gages in the primary market, after two months of decline, remained un-
changed during December and early January, according to field reports
and other sources. By year-end, rates on both new- and existing-home
mortgages averaged about 20 basis points below the September peaks
(HUD-FHA series). At around 8-3/4 per cent, however, they continued
above usury ceilings of 8-1/2 per cent or less which now prevail in
13 states and the District of Columbia. Average rates on conventional
home mortgage loans closed--which still reflect to some degree the rapid-
ly rising rates on new commitments in the third quarter--edged up further
in December.

II -18
In the secondary market, supplies of loans remained limited
during December and demands were strong for Government-underwritten
mortgages for loan pools to back GNMA-guaranteed securities. Reflecting
these conditions, private secondary market yields on 8-1/2 per cent
FHA-insured mortgages declined somewhat further. With such loans selling
at a price close to par at year end, speculation continued about a
possible near-term cut in the administratively-determined contract rate.
Because the volume of offerings in the December 17 FNMA auction for
forward purchase commitments of FHA/VA home mortgages was again quite
small, the next auction was postponed until January 14 (results will
be included in the Greenbook Supplement).

nearest 5 basis points. On FHA loans carrying the 7 per cent ceiling rate
in effect from mid-February 1971 until July 1, 1973, a change of 1 point
in discount is associated with a change of 12 to 14 basis points in
yield. FHA rate was raised to 7-3/4 per cent in July 1973. Reliable data

Federal finance. On a unified budget basis, our fiscal 1974
outlays forecast is $272.0 billion, unchanged since the December Greenbook.
Due to revised income assumptions, the fiscal 1974 receipts projection
has been raised $1.0 billion to $267.5 billion, leaving a deficit of
$4.5 billion.
Although the projection of overall budget outlays is unchanged
for fiscal 1974, certain compositional changes have been made which
affect the National Income Accounts expenditure forecast. In particular,
NIA expenditures for calendar 1974 have been increased by $3.3 billion
to reflect higher transfer payments (mainly for the food stamp program,
supplemental security income, medicare, and civil service retirement)
and the recent enactment of legislation providing for a resumption of
public service employment. However, these items have been offset in
our budget outlays forecast by an increase in expected proceeds from
the sale of oil leases--at item which is treated as a negative outlay
in the unified budget but is omitted from the national income accounts.
The general social security benefit increase has now been
enacted with a 7 per cent increase starting in April and a further 4 per
cent increase scheduled for July. The full annual rate effect of these
two increases is expected to be $6.2 billion.
Our receipts projections do not incorporate possible new
taxes on oil. Just prior to Christmas, the Administration proposed a
"windfall profits" tax on the sale of crude oil--a progressive rate
excise tax designed to fade out over a five-year period. A description
of this tax proposal and some discussion of its effects on incentives
will be given in the Greenbook Supplement.

II -20
The fiscal 1975 budget will be presented shortly after the
January FOMC meeting. However, certain preliminary numbers have been
mentioned by budget officials in press interviews. Based on these reports,
fiscal 1975 receipts on a unified budget basis are likely to be forecast
at $294 billion and outlays at around $303 billion for a deficit of
under $10 billion. The receipts figure contains $3 to $5 billion in
new oil tax revenue.
The end-of-December Treasury cash balance was $10.4 billion,
$1.3 billion above the level forecast in the December Greenbook. This
rather sizable difference was due to a short-fall in outlays. The end-
of-January cash balance is now forecast at $11.5 billion.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. On the official settlements basis, the
U.S. balance of payments was in surplus by an estimated $12 billion
(seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the fourth quarter of 1973, reducing
the deficit for the year to about $5 billion. In addition, the dollar has
been extremely strong in the exchanges in recent weeks as market partic-
1pants reacted to the latest round of oil price increases. From about
Christmas to mid-January the dollar appreciated by 5 percent, on average,
against the major foreign currencies, even while central banks were
supplying the market with large amounts of dollars.
The fragmentary data now available for the fourth quarter of
1973 suggest a substantial net inflow of short-term capital, together with
sizable net foreign purchases of U.S. stocks. The trade balance, after
showing extremely large surpluses in September and October, slipped back
to about zero in November. For the year 1973 the trade account is expected
to be approximately in balance, compared to a deficit of $6.9 billion in
1972.
The outlook for the U.S. balance of payments in 1974 is obscured
by uncertainties stemming from the oil situation. Even if the United States
received no oil produced in Arab countries during 1974, our fuel import bill
might rise from about $8 billion in 1973 to some $21 billion in 1974,
solely because of the assumed rise in the average oil price to nearly $10 per
barrel. Largely as a result, the United States might incur a merchandise
trade deficit in the neighborhood of $5 billion in 1974 -- rather than

III -2
the sizable surplus expected earlier -- and a small deficit in the balance
on goods and services. Many other industrialized countries will probably
also experience marked deteriorations in their current-account balances
as a result of the rise in oil prices.
The major imponderables in the outlook include (1) the effects
here and abroad of high oil prices on the course of the business cycle,
which in most countries has already passed the phase of most rapid growth,
and (2) the use by oil-exporting countries of their increased oil revenues,
which may rise from about $27 billion in 1973 to about $90 billion in 1974.
In Japan and most European countries the high cost of fuel is
now expected to weaken aggregate demand, but because of continuing high
rates of inflation governments are less likely to adopt strongly expan-
sionary policies. As a result, from 1973 to 1974 the growth of real
GNP in foreign industrial countries may well be only 1 or 2 percent; and
growth in the volume of world trade may fall off appreciably.
In all likelihood, most of the increase in oil exporters'
revenues will not be used to acquire goods and services or gold, but will
be held as financial assets or other investments acquired directly or
indirectly from the industria countries. The United States may well
receive a share of these investment flows more than sufficient to offset
its increased oil payments as well as any additional outflows resulting
from the recent relaxation of U.S. capital controls.

III -3
Foreign exchange markets. The appreciation of the dollar, which
began around the end of October when the oil crisis erupted, accelerated
in late December and early January following the pre-Christmas doubling
of oil prices by Middle East governments. From mid-December to mid-
January the dollar appreciated by around 5 per cent, on average, against
major foreign currencies, even as official intervention supplied some
$4.2 billion to the market to moderate that rise. Market participants
apparently believed that the United States would be the recipient of
capital flows, arising from the investment of the prospective huge incre-
ment to oil-producing countries' receipts, in excess of the deterioration
of the U.S. current account consequent upon the rise in oil prices.

The largest dollar sales have been by Japan, $1.9 billion, and
Germany, $1.3 billion. In addition, Italy, Britain, and France also sold
substantial amounts of dollars while Switzerland sold a lesser amount.
The System has intervened in Swiss francs in recent weeks, using the proceeds
to repay swap drawings, while the U.S. Treasury has intervened on a small
scale in marks, French francs and Belgian francs.

While for a time all European currencies tended to move more
or less together against the dollar, in the past week pressures within
the European bloc have begun to develop. The French franc is at present
alone at the bottom of the snake, with its partner currencies all clustered
near the top. France has intervened mainly in dollars rather than other
European currencies to keep the franc from depreciating below its European
limits.
One of the results of the downward pressures on European currencies
and the Japanese yen (the Canadian dollar alone has tended to firm against
the U.S. dollar), has been a tendency for several of the major countries
to ease their restrictions on capital flows. In addition to the U.S.
actions (discussed below on p. III -8), Germany has indicated its intention
of lifting its controls on inflows, and on January 11 took the first step
by eliminating marginal reserve requirements on banks' foreign liabilities.
Japan took several steps toward easing its controls on inflows. In particular,
it eliminated restrictions on foreign purchases of Japanese stocks, removed
ceilings on banks' net foreign liabilities, and drastically reduced marginal
reserve requirements on foreign liabilities. France on January 15 eliminated
reserve requirements on French banks' franc-denominated foreign liabilities
while increasing requirements on domestic liabilities.
Gold prices surged in early January, reaching the previous,
July, 1973 high of $127 in London on January 8, reflecting the general movement
out of European currencies and speculation that Arab countries might purchase
gold with a part of their increased oil revenues. Though the gold price
subsequently eased back somewhat, it still remains near its high.

III -5
Euro-dollar markets. Interest rates on Euro-dollar deposits
have declined over the past five weeks. This decline reflected the passing
of the seasonal upward pressure on Euro-dollar rates at year-end, the
decrease in short-term interest rates in the United States and the surge
in demand for dollars on exchange markets during the period. Three-month
Euro-dollar deposits were bid at an average rate of about 9-1/2 per cent
in the week ended January 16, down from an average level of nearly 10-3/4
per cent in the week ended December 12. The smaller decline in the com-
parable maturity CD rate during this period, from 9-1/2 to 9 per cent,
reduced but did not eliminate the higher differential cost of Euro-dollar

than did longer maturity Euro-dollar rates. For the week ended January 16,
as in mid-December, over-night Euro-dollar borrowing was less expensive
than Federal funds borrowing for U.S. banks with a reserve-free base, but
more expensive if subject to the 8 per cent marginal reserve requirement.
U.S. banks' liabilities to their foreign branches declined
from a daily average of $2.4 billion in the week ended December 12 to

U.S. balance of payments. The U.S. international payments
position showed further strong imporvement in the closing months of 1973.
The dollar appreciated sharply on foreign exchange markets (as described
above) and the official settlements balance rose to an estimated
surplus of $3 billion (seasonally adjusted but not at an annual rate)
in the fourth quarter, about $1 billion higher than the surplus in the
third quarter. However, because of the $10 billion deficit posted in
the first quarter of 1973, when the dollar was under heavy attack, the
official settlements balance for the entire year 1973 was in deficit
by about $5 billion. In 1972 this balance was in deficit by over
$10 billion.

III -7
From the very partial information now available for specific
transactions in the fourth quarter, it appears that the improvement in
the fourth quarter stemmed from an inflow of short-term capital. The
U.S. trade surplus in October-November was little changed from the
rate in the third quarter. The basic surplus on current account and
long-term capital transactions was probably not as large as the extra-
ordinarily large surplus of $2-1/2 billion (not at an annual rate ) in
the third quarter when the balance on private long-term capital flows
was unusually favorable.
The fourth-quarter inflow balance on private securities
transactions was probably quite large, although somewhat less than
in the third quarter. Foreign net purchases of U.S. stocks, though
very small in October, increased sharply in November to over $400 million,
the largest amount since February. Large purchases were reported for
Japan, France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. While the U.S.
stock market weakened in November, the oil crisis resulted in an even
sharper decline in the Japanese stock market and generated considerable
uncertainty about alternative investment opportunities in Europe.
Brokers report continued heavy foreign buying of U.S. equities in
December. Foreign private purchases of offshore Euro-bond issues by
U.S. corporations also picked up substantially in the fourth quarter --
particularly in December -- but purchases of other types of U.S. corporate
bonds remained at a very low level. U.S. net purchases of foreign bonds --

IIt -8
particularly Israeli -- also increased in the fourth quarter, totaling
over $500 million compared with only $200 million in the third quarter.
Bank-reported claims on foreigners increased by a total of
nearly $1-1/4 billion in October-November, a greater than seasonal
increase. There was an outflow of about $400 million for long-term
loans in contrast to the third-quarter inflow of net repayments amounting
to about $200 million. Short-term claims were also up in these months.
About half of the reported increase in claims by U.S. commercial banks
consisted of export credits which are exempt from the VFCR program.
The bulk of the increase in claims by U.S. agencies of foreign banks
was in types subject to the VFCR program, but the increase in these
regulated claims was substantially less than the increase in borrowings
of these agencies from abroad.
The various programs of restraint on U.S. capital outflows to
foreign countries have been relaxed, effective January 1, 1974. The
Interest Equalization Tax (IET) on acquisitions of foreign securities
has been reduced from about 3/4 of one percent to the fairly nominal
rate of about 1/4 of one percent. In addition, the controls on U.S.
direct investments in foreign countries have been substantially
liberalized, and the VFCR controls on bank lending to foreign residents
have been relaxed somewhat.
U.S. foreign trade. U.S. merchandise trade for November was
in approximate balance, following very large surpluses in September

III -9
and October. Imports in November rose sharply to about 12 percent above
the October level, while exports rose by 4-1/2 percent. At a quarterly
rate, the trade surplus for October-November was slightly below that in
the third quarter, while for the first eleven months of 1973 there was
a deficit of less than $0.1 billion (balance of payments basis), a
dramatic improvement over the $6.9 billion deficit recorded in 1972.
Over the past year, the unit value of U.S. trade has risen faster than
the volume, accounting for over half of the increase in exports and
90 percent of the rise in imports since the fourth quarter of 1972.

Agricultural exports accounted for 60 percent of the increase
in total exports in November. Agricultural exports in October-November
(at a quarterly rate) were 6 percent above the third-quarter 1973, and
85 percent above the fourth quarter 1972, with most of the latter
increase due to sharp rises in the prices of grains and soybeans.

III -10
The unit value of agricultural exports in October-November was 63 per-
cent higher than in the fourth-quarter 1972.
Nonagricultural exports in November continued their steady
increase. In October-November these exports (at a quarterly rate)
were 9 percent above their third-quarter level, paced by large increases
in the unit value of industrial supplies and materials and in the
volume of consumer goods and automotive exports.
Nonfuel imports jumped by 7 percent in October-November
following relative stability in the preceding two quarters. The increase,
attributed largely to rising unit values, was broadly distributed
across commodity categores. Foodstuffs increased in volume as well
as value (following a decline in volume earlier in 1973), partly
because of the relaxation of U.S. sugar import quotas.
Imports of fuels and lubricants, mainly petroleum, soared
by 24 percent in November and accounted for more than one-fourth of the
increase in total imports in that month. Most of this increase was
due to higher prices, as the unit value of these imports rose by
almost 15 percent over the October level. The volume of fuel imports
in November also rose, by about 8 percent. Statistics compiled by the
American Petroleum Institute indicate, however, that the quantity of
petroleum (particularly crude) imports has dropped off sharply since
November. The average daily quantity imported in the last week of
December and first week of January was about 23.5 percent below the

III -11
daily average for the month of November. The embargo on exports of
Arab crude to the United States appears to have taken effect, though
the inflow of petroleum products from third-country refineries has
dropped off much less than that of crude. Despite the reduced volume
of petroleum imports, the increase in world oil prices portends a
dramatic rise in the value of those imports in 1974.
There is little evidence in the November trade data to
suggest that the world oil situation had at that early date exerted
any significant effect on U.S. trade other than to raise the unit value
of petroleum imports. There have been reports of spot shortages of
bunker fuel for ocean carriers beginning in mid-November, ships have
been moving at slower speeds in order to use fuel more efficiently,
and there was a decline in the volume of automotive imports from
Europe and Japan despite rising demand and very tight small-car
inventory positions at home. However, the volume of total U.S.
merchandise trade in November increased by 5.4 percent (65 percent
at an annual rate) over its October level, and under the U.S. fuel
allocation system, vessels in U.S. ports are to be allocated 100 per-
cent of their fueling requirements.

III -12
The impact of the oil situation on economic activity in foreign
industrial countries. Until very recently the outlook for world economic
activity was dominated by the possible effects on domestic supply potential
of Arab oil cutbacks. With the late December decisions of producers to
ease the supply situation and to double the price, the focus of projections
for 1974 has shifted once more. Now it is expected that supply constraints
will be important only for the first quarter of the year and that the
change in relative prices will predominate.
The price increases announced by the Persian Gulf producers in
October and December (combined with earlier increases in 1973) raised
producer government royalties and taxes (the government "take") from
$1.75/barrel in January 1973 to $7.00/barrel on January 1, 1974. The
difference between the import price, c.i.f., on the one hand, and the
producer royalties and taxes, on the other, comprises the cost of pro-
duction of oil, company profits, and freight and insurance. If these
amounts remain at current levels, the increase in the import price will
be about $5. However, this may be a conservative estimate because the
price of non-Arabian oil seems to be increasing even more sharply, so
that the total revenues of the oil-producing countries and the oil
import bills of the industrial countries may rise more than the Arab
price increase implies.
Estimates have been made of the effect of the price increases
on the oil import bill of the major industrial countries. These

III -13
estimates, however, can indicate only general magnitudes and obviously
depend critically on the assumptions made about both the price of oil
and the volume of imports. The estimates assume an increase in the
average price of about $5-1/2 per barrel. The volume of imports assumed
is less than that normally associated with the projected activity levels,
to allow for conservation measures and energy-source substitution induced
by the substantially higher oil price.
The table on page III-14 shows estimated oil import increases
for the major industrial countries. For all OECD countries the increase
may amount to over $50 billion and for the non-oil-producing LDC's to
about $8 billion; the increase in the total oil bill reaches nearly
$60 billion. Even with very large errors of estimation, the conclusion
that payments for oil will increase at an extraordinary rate is
inescapable. This poses two major problems: the international pay-
ments problems that may be associated with so large a shift of payments
by non-oil producers to oil producers, and the demand management
problems associated with the deflationary effects of these large price
changes.
If the oil-producing countries could and would spend their
increased earnings on goods and services, then the payments problem
would be solely a problem of the distribution and composition of demand
among countries and outputs. Although the amount by which exports to

Note: January 1974 forecasts include estimates of increased exports to oil producing countries.
The difference in the October and January forecasts reflects the effect on current accounts of
changed expectations about the level of economic activity as well as the increased oil import
bill. The exchange rates used in the 1974 forecasts are those prevailing at the time of each
forecast. Current Account is defined as net goods and services and private and official transfers.

the oil-producing countries may increase is extremely difficult to
estimate, only a few can be expected to spend a major portion of these
large earnings. And even for these the import response will take some
time to materialize. The large oil exporting countries that might
significantly expand imports are Iran, Algeria, Iraq, Nigeria,
Venezuela, and Indonesia. They (and some smaller countries with
potentially high absorption capacity for imports) are expected to
account for about 60 per cent of the increases in producer revenues.
The rest, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Libya and other Arab states, would
find it difficult to expand imports by very much. For all oil pro-
ducers together the total increase in imports might reach $10-11
billion and most of this amount probably would be spent in the OECD
countries.
Estimates of the major industrial countries' current accounts
are shown (and contrasted with pre-oil crisis forecasts) in the table.
These estimates incorporate only the net effects of the higher oil
import bill and the associated increased exports to the oil-producing
countries. On this basis, the current account of all OECD countries
might deteriorate by about $40 billion vis-a-vis the oil-producing
countries.
However, the largest part of the higher payments to oil
producers will flow back in the form of investments in the industrial
world. Thus, for the industrial countries as a group, the net overall

III -16
payments position may be little changed, although the structure of
their payments balance would change appreciably. But it is not likely
that the flow of investment funds from the oil-producing countries will
be distributed according to the origin of the increases in their
revenues. Thus, some countries may be experiencing deteriorations in
their overall payments positions as well as in their current account
balances, and others may improve their overall positions despite a
deterioration on current account. To what extent these developments
will put strains on the international payments system depends upon the
policy responses to the pattern of payments changes as it develops.
Attempts by all countries to protect their current balance positions
clearly would not only be self-defeating, but would also compound the
demand management problems that are associated with the deflationary
effects of the increased oil import bills themselves.
The increase in oil prices will have a direct effect on the
price levels of the importing countries, roughly estimated at about
2 percentage points on the GNP deflator on average, as volumes remain
about unchanged and expenditures rise. In the absence of offsetting
policy-measures, this implies any one of a combination of the following
consequences: (1) a reduction in expenditure on domestic goods and
services both for consumption and investment; (2) a reduction in savings
as an attempt is made to protect real consumption; and (3) a fall in

III -17
spending on non-oil imports. The deflationary impact of the reduction
in domestic spending may well outweigh any remaining supply-induced
output shortfalls, leaving a margin of unused resources at a time when
economic activity is already slowing down.
On the whole, despite some fears of recession in the industrial
countries, there has been no marked shift away from demand restraint
yet, nor any indication that moves will be undertaken to offset the
deflationary implications of the oil price increase. This may reflect
a policy lag, but more likely it is the consequence of the continued
emphasis on restraining inflation. A shift to an easier monetary policy
may be limited in some countries by the desire to induce capital inflows
in order to offset worsening current accounts. If lower interest rates
were generally desired, an international understanding concerning common
objectives might be necessary to bring them about promptly. So far
interest rates have been lowered only in the United Kingdom, and there
only by a small amount. The recent reduction in reserve requirements in
Germany is designed only to offset the domestic liquidity losses created
by the capital outflows and do not signify an easing of policy. In
France, Italy and Japan the stance of monetary policy seems to be one
of continued or greater restraint.
The difficulties that the non-oil-producing LDC's have been
placed in by the oil price increases will probably aggravate the
balance of payments and demand management problems of the industrial

III -18
countries. The LDCs' demand for non-oil imports will be directly re-
duced because of the higher oil payments, and also because their level
of economic activity will probably be lowered. Some non-oil primary
producers might try to raise their prices, posing additional problems
for the industrial countries.
A look at economic activity and policy-measures in the major
countries will provide a base against which future developments can be
judged. In Japan, industrial production had increased strongly through-
out 1973 and in November 1973 was 16.6 per cent above November 1972.
However, since October 1973 the rise has stopped and some press comment
indicates actual declines since November. Official and private fore-
casts, issued in December before Japan was told it would be treated as
a friendly country by the Arab oil producers, were very pessimistic.
They predicted a 1-2 per cent increase in production in fiscal year
1974 (which begins April 1, 1974) over 1973. The government forecast
for real GNP for fiscal 1974 over fiscal 1973 was 2.5 per cent.
Japanese real GNP has usually grown by 5-6 per cent in "recession"
years. However, it is not clear how much these forecasts will be
revised following the December oil measures. Policymakers clearly are
still worried over the oil supply situation since they have ordered,
starting January 16, a mandatory cutback of 15 per cent in oil and

III -19
electricity supplies to major industries below what would have been used
in the absence of the oil crisis.
However, the major concern of Japanese policymakers is the
severe underlying inflation. With wholesale prices in December already
29.0 per cent higher than a year earlier, an additional 3-4 points
increase in the rate of inflation due to increases in oil prices is
considered to be relatively less important. Thus, demand restraint
is likely to continue, at least in the near future. Monetary policy
was tightened throughout 1973, and the discount rate was raised from
7 to 9 per cent in December. In addition, public expenditures have
been cut back sharply from earlier plans.
The Japanese balance of payments has switched from a large
surplus to a considerable deficit with great rapidity adding to the
difficulties faced by policymakers. So far the authorities have dealt
with the problem by drawing down reserves, allowing some depreciation
of the yen, and taking some measures to slow capital outflows.
In the United Kingdom,the oil situation's impact is swamped --
at least in the short run -- by serious labor disputes which have
drastically cut total energy supplies. A coal shortage has been created
by the miners' ban on overtime work; this has been exacerbated by a
slowdown by some railwaymen causing reductions of about 40 per cent in
the delivery of coal to electric power stations. The government has
taken drastic measures, most notably institution of a three-day work

III -20
week, to curb the industrial use of electricity. One estimate is that
industrial production is now 20-40 per cent below normal and that on
any given day 3 million workers are unemployed. This situation has
clearly damaged public confidence. This is evidenced in part in recent
surveys of business intentions which indicate that the growth in invest-
ment will be lower than previously expected.
The oil price rise will increase the current account deficit
that the U.K. was previously expected to incur by something approaching
$5 billion. Because of the high import content of British output, the
authorities will probably be unwilling to accept the upward price
pressures that would result from a further depreciation of sterling.
Thus the authorities may encourage continued foreign borrowing by the
public sector (with exchange rate guarantees), borrow officially them-
selves, or run down reserves.
The British authorities, in an effort to continue to accommodate
a shift of resources to exports and private investment, announced large
reductions in public expenditures to start with the new fiscal year
beginning April 1. In addition, controls on installment buying have
been reimposed, and the Bank of England has introduced a new system of
special deposits to enhance its ability to control the growth of money
and credit. However, social conflict is the main problem facing Britain
now, and demand management policies cannot be very successful in the
current social climate.

III -21
In Germany, real GNP in 1973 increased by 5-1/2 per cent over
1972, a little below the 6 per cent that was generally forecast. Before
the oil shortage, growth in 1974 was expected to be 3-4 per cent, slightly
less than the 4-1/2 per cent trend rate; at the onset of the oil crisis
forecasts were revised to predict little or no growth, mainly because of
supply problems. The December oil announcements have created the
possibility that real GNP growth could reach 1-1/2 -2 per cent in 1974.
If supply constraints ease even further, a commensurately higher growth
rate would be possible, given certain policy assumptions. But in 1973,
the German authorities instituted one of the most severe monetary and
fiscal restraint programs of the last decade. In November, restraint
was eased sor what, the main measure being the early removal of the 11
per cent investment tax. But on balance, fiscal policy remains restric-
tive as does monetary policy. The government, in preparing its annual
report on the economic situation due at the end of this month, is review-
ing policy options,and expectations are that there may be some further
relaxation of, at least, fiscal restraint.
Because of a huge trade surplus, the German balance of payments
in 1973 was very strong. And the expected increase in the oil bill may
result in only a relatively small current account deficit in 1974. The
German reserve position is also very strong, net reserves in January
totalling well over $30 billion. To help protect the external position,
the government is about to loosen controls on capital inflows.

III -22
In France, industrial output had been expanding rapidly before
the oil crisis, but since September growth had begun to slow somewhat,
partly in response to restrictive demand management measures taken earlier.
Nevertheless, GNP had been expected to grow at 5.5 per cent in 1974 over
1973, equal to the underlying growth rate for the economy.
Since the oil crisis, forecasts for economic growth have been
revised downward primarily because of a reduction in the expected
expansion of world trade. The slower rate of growth of exports, taken
together with the deflationary effects of the oil price increases, have
led to a downward revision of the 1974 GNP estimates to 2.5 -3.0 per
cent. The automobile industry and some other sectors have already felt
the impact, and it is possible that the unemployment rate in 1974 will
rise from 2 per cent to 4 per cent, which is very high for France.
The officially expected balance of trade surplus of $1-1/2
billion for 1974 has now been revised to a very substantial deficit of
$4 billion. This shift of $5-1/2 billion is rather more than that shown
in the table, but is likely to be substantial in any event. Since
official reserves have been declining recently from the high levels
reached in mid-1973, the French government has begun to worry about
further reserve declines. Accordingly, the government in October
loosened controls on capital inflows and its anti-inflationary policies
seem to be tightening. The authorities hope that the inflationary

III -23
forces will be sufficiently weakened in the first half of 1974 to enable
the economy to return to a higher growth path.
Italy has been enjoying a very strong recovery after the dis-
ruptions caused by work stoppages in 1972 and early 1973. Industrial
production in November 1973 was 13.2 per cent over the same month in
1972 and for the whole of 1973 is expected to be more than 8 per cent
higher than in 1972. The growth of real GNP for 1973 should be 5 per
cent over 1972. However, the outlook for 1974, which before the oil cut-
backs was bright, with real GNP growing at 6 per cent, is now more
doubtful. Compounding the oil difficulties is a very high rate of
inflation; wholesale prices in November 1973 were 22 per cent higher than
a year earlier. The expected improvement in the balance of payments has
failed to materialize and abstracting from the oil price impact, slower
growth abroad may prolong the period of deficit. In order to cushion
the effect of the deficits on official reserves, the Italian authorities
have been requesting public authorities to borrow heavily in Euro-
currency markets. Monetary policy has remained tight. A further large
lire depreciation is a less likely device because of its inflationary
effects.
The Netherlands is still embargoed by the Arab oil producers,
but the embargo has been far from effective. With an increase in total
oil supplies, the Dutch, therefore, are also likely to receive greater

III -24
oil shipments. Still, the impact of the current oil situation is esti-
mated to have reduced the 1974 supply potential of the economy to about
the 1973 level. Consequently, unless oil supplies ease significantly,
GNP is expected to remain level rather than increase by 4 per cent as
earlier expected. However, the rate of inflation is very high and
accelerating: the government forecasts a 13 per cent rise in the cost
of living in 1974. At the same time unemployment is high and continues
to rise. But the balance of payments situation is more comfortable than
in most other countries, since in 1973 a large and growing current account
surplus appeared.
The direct output effects of the oil crisis are not expected to
be very important in Canada. The increased world price of oil has led
the government to tax oil exports at a rate approximately equal to the
difference between the frozen domestic Canadian price and the world
price. However, there is a question whether the domestic price for oil
can remain relatively low compared to world price levels. Moreover, the
effects of the oil situation on the rate of growth of Canada's export
markets, particularly the U.S., could have significant effects on
Canadian growth. Before the December oil announcements, some Canadian
analysts were forecasting real GNP growth for 1974 at about 4 per cent
compared to the pre-oil estimates of 5 -5-1/2 per cent.
