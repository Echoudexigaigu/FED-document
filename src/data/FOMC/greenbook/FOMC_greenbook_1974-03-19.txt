Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act.           
 
   
 
    
 
                                                            
 
1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent economic news has been mixed. Adjustments to the oil
shortage are still acting as a drag on overall economic activity, but
the rate of decline may be moderating, as auto sales and assemblies
have tended to stabilize. Prices have continued to rise rapidly. There
have been more frequent reports that the oil embargo may be lifted; as
of this writing, however, no action has been taken.
Industrial production is estimated to have declined 0.6
per cent in February, following somewhat larger reductions in December
and January. Auto assemblies declined a little in February following
sharp earlier reductions, but production in the auto supplying industries
was off considerably. Output of nondurable consumer goods fell for the
third consecutive month. Production of business equipment appears to
have been maintained close to the downward revised January level.
Recent sluggishness in the business equipment sector appears to be
partly the result of supply and capacity limitations.
Developments in the labor market in February were somewhat
more encouraging than in the preceding few months. The unemployment rate
remained unchanged at 5.2 per cent. Total payroll employment rose
appreciably, following an upward revision of the January estimate, but
there was a further large decline in manufacturing, heavily concentrated
in durable goods industries.
Consumer demand continued weak in February. Unit auto sales
declined a little further from an already low January level, reflecting

I- 2
a drop in sales of both imported cars and small domestic-type models.
Retail sales other than for autos rose in nominal terms in February,
but were down in real terms and apparently were below the average of
the fourth quarter of 1973.
On the other hand, business demands for fixed capital still
appear relatively strong. A rise in new orders for nondefense capital
goods in January made up for a December decline; the January level
was 2-1/2 per cent above the fourth quarter. Order backlogs and unspent
capital appropriations in manufacturing were very large at year-end.
The latest Commerce survey, taken in February, now indicates a rise of
13 per cent in plant and equipment expenditures this year, compared
with 12 per cent in the previous survey. The upward revision occurred
mainly among suppliers of energy.
The rise in wage rates appears to have been quite moderate in
January and February, following large increases earlier. The adjusted
average hourly index for the private nonfarm economy in February was
6-3/4 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Wholesale prices rose sharply further in February, but
average increases for both farm products and foods and for industrial
commodities were not as large as in January. Industrial commodity prices
rose 1.3 per cent, compared with an average of 2.7 per cent over the pre-
ceding three months. Increases were large and widespread, but the
rise in petroleum prices was less precipitous. In January, the consumer
price index rose 1 per cent, with foods and fuels accounting for a
substantial portion of the total increase.

I -3
Outlook. Staff assumptions are virtually unchanged from last
month. (1) The projection assumes continuation of the oil embargo.
(2) Growth in M1 is assumed to average about 5-3/4 per cent over the
year. Short-term interest rates, given the M1 assumption and the
slower growth in nominal GNP, would be expected to decline somewhat
in the next few months from recently higher levels, and then to rise
in the second half of the year. (3) Our fiscal assumptions are close
to those of the budget, although with a somewhat different timing
pattern for expenditures in calendar 1974. We have not incorporated
the "emergency windfall profits tax" for petroleum and products.
(4) The projection assumes that wage and price controls--except for
health services and petroleum--will be ended by April 30, when the
legislation expires.
Real GNP is now projected to be a little weaker in the first
half of the year than in last month's projection, and to be a little
stronger in the second half. For 1974 as a whole, however, the figures
are virtually the same as a month ago. The unemployment rate is
projected to show the same pattern as before, rising to a little over
6 per cent in the fourth quarter.
The staff is now projecting a decline in real GNP at an
annual rate of close to 3-1/2 per cent in the first quarter. Consumer
spending appears even weaker than it did four weeks ago, and the saving
rate is projected to remain near the relatively high fourth quarter

I-4
level. Real purchases of both durable and nondurable goods are likely
to be down for the quarter. Residential construction activity is off
sharply further. Available inventory data are quite limited, but we
expect about the same rate of inventory investment as in the fourth
quarter, even though dealer stocks of autos may not add to the total,
in contrast to the large rise in the fourth quarter.
The main change in the projection for the second half of the
year is a somewhat larger rise in business fixed investment. The new
pattern is consistent with the latest Commerce survey, which indicates
somewhat more expansion in the second half of 1974. We still expect a
rise in real consumer purchases in the second half, with auto sales
increasing because of the greater availability of small cars, also,
housing starts and residential construction activity are still pro-
jected to increase moderately. Business inventory investment, however,
is projected to decline further in view of the generally moderate
nature of final demands.
Price increases in the first half are projected to be slightly
larger than earlier expected, averaging a 7-3/4 per cent annual rate
for the private fixed weight deflator. The sharper increases in
prospect for food prices account for the upward revision. In the
second half of the year, the private fixed weight deflator is still
projected to increase at an annual rate of 5-3/4 per cent.

Industrial production. Industrial production is estimated to
have declined 0.6 per cent further in February, following a drop of 0.7
per cent(revised)in January and 0.8 per cent in December. The total
index at 124.8 per cent, was down 2.1 per cent from the November high
but was 1.1 per cent above February, a year ago.
Auto assemblies declined 4 per cent further in February and
were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.6 million units. Output
of other durable consumer goods was maintained at advanced levels but
production of nondurable consumer goods declined further. Output of
business equipment remained at the reduced January level which reflected
strikes at power equipment manufacturers. Production of steel and non-
ferrous metals was at capacity rates in February but output of consumer
durable materials (mainly in auto supplying industries) declined 3.5
per cent further. Output of the textile, paper, and chemical group and
of some other nondurable goods materials was also down.

Retail sales. Total sales in February wereO.7 per cent lower
than in January and only 3.3 per cent above a year earlier. Sales of the
automotive group declined 5.7 per cent from January and purchases at
gasoline stations were down 4.1 per cent. Excluding autos and non-
consumer items, sales increased slightly in February.
Sales in February were 0.3 per cent below the fourth quarter
average, largely as a result of a continued downtrend in outlays for
durable goods. Purchases of nondurable goods were up 2.5 per cent from
the final quarter of 1973, with sales of food and general merchandise both
increasing more than 4 per cent.

Unit sales of consumer durables. February sales of new
domestic-type autos were at a 7.4 million unit rate, down 4 per cent
from January and off 27 per cent from February last year. Small
cars sold at a 2.7 million unit seasonally adjusted annual rate, down
12 per cent from January; while large car sales, at a 4.7 million
unit rate, were the same as in January. Small cars accounted for 36
per cent of domestic-type unit sales, down from 39 per cent in
January but still above the 27 per cent of February a year earlier.
Stocks of all domestic-type new autos were equivalent to a
68 day supply in February, the same as in January and down slightly
from the December high. The imbalance between stocks of large and
small cars lessened somewhat; nevertheless, large car stocks are
still more than double those of small cars in terms of days supply.
Foreign auto sales in February were at a 1.6 million unit
rate, down 8 per cent from January and down 21 per cent from February
last year when the dollar devaluation encouraged purchases of imports
already landed. The market share of imports (seasonally adjusted)
was 18 per cent, approximately the same as in January but higher than
the 17 per cent in February last year.
Factory sales of major home appliances, TVs, and radios in
the first two weeks of February were up sharply from January due to
strong improvements in the sales of TVs and radios. Sales to
dealers of major appliances were about the same as in January.

Manufacturers orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 4.8 per cent in January (p), but this followed a drop of
6.2 per cent in December. The January increase was widespread but was
especially evident in the defense capital goods industries. Excluding
defense, new orders rose by 2.3 per cent. Primary metals orders
continued to decline. Orders for motor vehicles and parts, after
declining in November and December, increased 4.9 per cent in January.
Nondefense capital goods orders rose 3.7 per cent following a 3.4 per
cent decline in December.
Shipments of durable goods rebounded sharply with a 4.3
per cent increase in January following a 4.0 per cent drop in December;

I -12
both the December drop and the Jahuary rise were across the board.
Unfilled orders increased 1.4 per cent in January--a bit faster than
in December but still much slower than earlier in 1973.
The recent pattern of new and unfilled orders for non-
defense capital goods is broadly consistent with the new plant and
equipment spending plans just released by the Commerce Department.
The pickup in new orders since the sluggish third quarter of 1973 and
the continued strong increases in unfilled orders would suggest
sizable gains in investment through at least the first half of 1974;
the current level of backlogs would support shipments at the current
pace until late in the fourth quarter.

Inventories. The book value of manufacturers' and wholesale
trade inventories rose at a $27 billion annual rate in January (p),
down from the $37 billion December rate. The slowing in manufacturing
inventory growth was widespread, with some net liquidation in steel
mill inventories. Work-in-process inventories declined at a $0.6 billion
annual rate in January after rising at an $8.6 billion rate in December,
while finished goods stocks rose at little more than half the December
rate. However, inventories of materials and supplies increased almost
as much in January as in December. Wholesale trade inventories rose
faster in January than in December with much of the increase in farm
products and foods--areas of substantial price increases in January.

Of the eight leading series available for January, those
increasing were industrial materials prices, the ratio of price to
unit labor cost, new orders for durable goods, common stock prices
and building permits. The average workweek in manufacturing,
contracts and orders for plant and equipment and initial claims for
unemployment insurance (inverted) all declined in January.
Series available so far for February are common stock prices
which declined and the average workweek which rose.
Construction and real estate. Value of new construction
put in place continued downward in February, mainly reflecting a further
decline in private residential outlays, which were 20 per cent below
the peak reached a year earlier. Private non-residential and public
construction expenditures remained relatively close to their earlier
highs.

On a constant dollar basis, the over-all value of construction
put in place was down 12 per cent from the January 1973 peak. Alto-
gether, the Census composite index of construction costs has continued
upward in recent months at a level about one-tenth above a year earlier.
This rise compares with a 9 per cent increase during 1973 and 7 per
cent in other recent years.
Merchant builder sales of new single-family homes rose 6
per cent in January, but remained well below a year earlier and the
October 1972 peak. The number of unsold new homes edged higher and, at
the current sales rate, continued close to December's record 12 months'
supply. The median price of units sold declined 4 per cent, but was
still above the rising median price of houses available for sale.

While median prices of new and existing homes sold continued
high in January, a large part of the earlier increase apparently
reflected a shift in the mix of sales. After allowances for quality
differences, for example, the price index of new homes sold by merchant
builders rose little further from the third to fourth quarter of last
year. Even so, the price index was 10 per cent above a year earlier,
the same as the average increase for 1973 as a whole. Meanwhile, demand
for new rental apartments remained very strong. A near record 75 per
cent of the new units that became available during the third quarter
had been rented by year-end, though this may have reflected to some
extent some slowing in completions.
Anticipated plant and equipment spending. The Commerce
Department's recent survey of plant and equipment spending--taken in
late January and early February--shows that businesses are planning a
13.0 per cent increase for 1974, as compared to the 12.0 per cent gain
indicated in the prior survey taken in December. Manufacturers anticipate
larger outlays than planned earlier, with nondurable goods industries,
sparked by food and beverages and petroleum, showing larger upward
revisions than durable producers. Outside of manufacturing, plans on
average remain unchanged. For all industries, anticipations for the
first two quarters of 1974 have been revised downward, and plans for the
second half of the year show larger increases than plans for the first
half. Actual fourth quarter outlays (at annual rates) were $1.2 billion
less than plans indicated in November; as a result, plant and equipment
expenditures registered a 12.8 per cent increase for 1973, slightly less
than previously expected.

I -18
The results of the Commerce survey differ from those reported
in rechecks of surveys by McGraw-Hill, Rinfret-Boston-Associates and
Lionel D. Edie and Co. These resurveys, taken at about the same time
as the Commerce survey, show anticipated gains of around 19 per cent
for 1974, up significantly from those reported in the fall. The pri-
vate surveys also indicate large upward revisions in the plans of
energy supplying industries--a pattern that is not so pronounced in the
Commerce survey. It should be noted that the McGraw-Hill, Rinfret,
and Edie samples are dominated by large firms, whereas the Commerce
survey is more comprehensive; this explains a good deal of the discrep-
ancy between the Commerce and private surveys.

Newly approved capital appropriations of large manufacturing
companies, as reported by the Conference Board, edged upward in the
fourth quarter of 1973. The dollar value of appropriations remained
at a high level and backlogs of unspent appropriations continued to
climb; backlogs could support the current level of capital spending in
manufacturing for close to five quarters.
Labor market. The unemployment rate remained at 5.2 per cent
in February as both total employment and the labor force were unchanged.
Jobless rates for most major labor force groups showed little change
over the month. Since October, however, the number of unemployed workers
has increased by 650,000 and the over-all unemployment rate has climbed
over a half a percentage point, with increases in joblessness wide-
spread. Particularly hard hit have been semi-skilled blue collar work-
ers and sales workers in industries affected by energy shortages. In
addition, the number of full time workers reduced to part-time status
because of adverse economic factors has increased by half a million
since October.

Manufacturing employment declined again in February although
a rise in trade and service jobs and a rebound in construction pushed
total nonfarm payroll employment up by 175,000, following declines in
the preceding two months. The February increase and a large upward
revision in the January figure returned the payroll job total to the
level reached in November 1973, but the number of manufacturing jobs
was down by 235,000. Job losses in manufacturing have been largest in
the transportation equipment industry reflecting, in large part, reduced
consumer demand for autos stemming from the gas shortage. In addition,
employment in trade is down since November (much of it in gas stations
and auto dealerships), and the pace of service employment growth has
slowed somewhat.

Preliminary data based on employer reports indicate that
from November to February between 125,000 and 200,000 jobs were lost as
a direct result of employer inability to obtain sufficient supplies of

I -21
fuel and petroleum-based products to maintain previous levels of
operation. Principally affected were gasoline service stations and air-
lines. Another estimate of the employment impact of energy shortages
comes from the unemployment insurance program, where about a quarter
million of the over 2 million workers filing continuing claims for
benefits report that their joblessness is either directly or indirectly
energy related.
Earnings. The average hourly earnings index for private
nonfarm production workers rose moderately in January and February and
generally has been growing at a reduced rate since the fall; slowdowns
from the pace earlier in the year have been evident in all industries.
Over the year the hourly earnings index has increased 6-3/4 per cent,
with similar rates of increase in all major industries.
Minimum wage. A comparison of the minimum wage legislation
currently before Congress is shown below. The Senate recently passed
S. 2747 (the Williams-Javits bill) and the House bill (Dent)--
H.R. 12435--has been reported to the full Labor Committee which is
expected to act soon. The major differences between the Senate and
House bills are: (1) the wage package--the Williams-Javits bill has a
lower minimum but a faster schedule of increase than its House counter-
part. (2) coverage--the Senate proposal would extend coverage to all
domestics who qualify for social security (earn $50 a quarter) while the
House bill limits coverage to those who work at least 8 hours a week.
Both bills are expected to cost about $1.5 billion this year if they are
enacted.

Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose 1.2 per cent,
seasonally adjusted (not at an annual rate), from January to

The index of prices of industrial commodities increased 1.3
per cent, seasonally adjusted, with higher prices for fuels and power,
metals and metal products, textile products and apparel, chemicals,
and building materials accounting for most of the rise. After
adjustment for seasonal influences, the lumber and wood products
group declined.
Although increases in prices of industrial commodities have
been widespread in recent months, the fuels and power group has been
especially important in the large overall rise that has occurred since
last September, as may be seen in the table below.

The increase in prices of fuels was of major importance in the rise in
wholesale prices from January to February, but the rise was smaller
than in recent months and the overall advance in industrial prices
also slowed despite large increases for metals and some other products.

I -25
A significant decline has occurred in spot prices of food-
stuffs since the end of February, but it is too soon to conclude that
it will continue. Livestock prices have been falling recently, but
the decline appears to be a temporary result of higher slaughter rates
due to relatively large numbers of heavy-weight cattle on feed and the
end of the truckers' strike. Livestock prices are expected to rise
again during the next few months as slaughter rates fall, and meat
prices--which have declined somewhat--are then likely to rise.
The March drop in grain prices follows an earlier climb to
very high levels. The decline may continue, but demand, nevertheless,
remains high in relation to likely increases in supply this year and
any deterioration in crop prospects could lead to higher prices.
Since the last week in February lower prices have also been
reported for some industrial commodities--fibers, silver, and hides,
for example--but prices of some other commodities, notably scrap
metals, have risen. The net effect of these changes has been little
movement in overall industrial materials prices in comparison with
the drop that agricultural prices have shown.
Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of
12.6 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in January as food prices resumed
a steep advance and fuel prices climbed further. The index was 9.4
per cent above January 1973. Excluding the food and energy components,
the 12-month increase would have been about 5 per cent, and the annual
rate of rise from December, about 5-1/2 per cent.

Meat, particularly poultry, and egg prices were up sharply
after receding from last August's peak levels. Most other food groups
also posted substantial advances, especially processed fruits and
vegetables, but the increases were not as large as in previous months
for prices of dairy products and cereal and bakery products, which have
soared since last July.

I -27
In February, according to preliminary, confidential estimates
from the Department of Agriculture, beef prices at retail were up
sharply and the retail cost of the USDA market basket rose consider-
ably more than in January.
The "spread" between the retail cost and the farm value of
the market basket continues at the high levels reached last quarter,
about 15 per cent above those in the first quarter of 1973. Since
this spread--which includes all nonfarm costs as well as profit
margins of processors and distributors--accounted for 56 per cent of
the retail cost in QI 1973, its rise contributed more than 8 percentage
points to the estimated increase at retail of over 20 per cent between
QI 1973 and QI 1974. High spreads on meat products, particularly
beef, appear to have been maintained, and those for fruits and
vegetables and cereal and bakery products also contributed dispro-
portionately to the total.

The index for nonfood commodities was boosted further by
sharp increases for petroleum products, prices of which have risen
since last September by about one-fourth (not annual rate). Prices
of other commodities, including household durables and housekeeping
supplies, increased more than in recent months, offset in part by
a decline for used cars.

A sharp jump in gas and electricity rates contributed to the
over 8 per cent rate of rise in service costs, while prices of medical
and other services also rose substantially.
Agriculture. Prices received by farmers increased 1-1/2 per
cent during the month ending February 15, to a level 36 per cent above
a year ago. Higher prices for vegetables and grains were partly

I -29
offset by lower livestock prices. In early March livestock prices
had dropped another 10 per cent and grains had also declined, but
not so steeply.
Red meat production in February was only slightly below
January despite a week during the trucker's strike when cattle and
hog marketings fell almost 20 per cent below the average for the
month. Slow movement of livestock during the strike and the
relatively large number of heavy-weight cattle on feed contributed
to the large marketings, and were a factor in the weak prices.
The decline in cattle prices relative to feed prices since
mid-January further worsens the situation in feeding operations,
which have been unprofitable since August. The number of cattle on
feed rose 2 per cent during January, to a level 4 per cent below a
year ago.
Prices of the traditionally low-priced foods--potatoes,
dry beans, and rice--increased 31, 20 and 8 per cent, respectively,
from mid-January to mid-February. Prices of these items are now,
respectively, 204, 368 and 209 per cent of their levels a year ago.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
In January and again in February, capital market borrowing by
businesses remained near the rapid rate of the final months of 1973,
while short-term borrowing from both banks and the commercial paper market
also continued large. The strength of businesses credit demands is
apparently indicative of a slowing in internal corporate cash flows and
a continued high rate of inventory accumulation. In addition, the higher
prices of goods and services require a larger volume of credit to finance
any given pace of real activity.
Although banks and other financial institutions also are
borrowing more and State and local bond offerings continue high, other
sectors have not been large demanders of funds. Mortgage and consumer
credit flows have continued at a reduced level, and the Treasury and
Federal agencies have borrowed little.
Commercial bank net inflows of consumer-type time deposits
remained high in February. Meanwhile, large weekly reporting banks per-
mitted negotiable CD's to run off in the course of the month in light
of other deposit inflows. Inflows of deposits to the savings and loan
associations in February continued near the improved pace which began
in the fourth quarter, while inflows at savings banks increased from
their low January rate. S&Ls continued to increase their liquidity,
which still remains below that of early 1973, and have begun to repay
FHLB advances. In late February, for the first time in a year, all
twelve FHLBank districts reported funds for home mortgages in adequate
supply relative to demand. Mortgage rates have continued to edge down-
ward, and there are scattered reports that some S&L deposit rates are
being reduced and advertising for deposits curtailed.

II -2
Since the February Committee meeting, short-term market rates
generally have increased by 1/4 to over 3/4 of a percentage point as
market expectations of a further easing in monetary policy were disap-
pointed in light of the stability of the funds rate, Chairman Burns'
congressional testimony stressing the need to combat inflation, and the
sharp increase in the aggregates in February. The bill rate came under
particular pressure from dealer financing costs, System sales of bills,
and a tax bill offering for new cash in late February. The prime rate,
however, was generally reduced 1/4 of a point from the 9 per cent level
in lagged reaction to declines in the commercial paper rate.
Dealers reduced their inventories of coupon issues acquired
in the February refunding through sales at declining prices. As a
result,Treasury note and bond yields have risen 15-35 basis points
since the last meeting. Corporate and municipal underwriters increased
their re-offering yields from 10 to 30 basis points in the last three
weeks as issues were moving slowly at the yields prevailing in mid-
February and the prospective new issue volume remained high,
There has yet been no statistical evidence of any significant
capital flows into or out of U.S. financial markets associated with the
removal of capital controls or large Arab oil payments, although there
have been market reports of U.S. investor funds moving into the Euro-dollar
market. Recent announcements of near-term foreign borrowing in U.S.
capital markets have totaled only about $150 million, while loans to
foreign businesses by large U.S. banks in February continued to decline.
Outlook. Interest rates have been in process of adjusting
upward to a revised market evaluation of the current stance of monetary

II -3
policy. Interest rates over the longer-run will depend not only on the
course of monetary policy but also on pressure of credit demands.
If economic activity remains on the weak side, as projected,
corporate working capital needs will be reduced and, consequently,
short-term credit demands of corporations on banks and the commercial
paper market will decline. Consumer credit demands are also likely to
continue to be constrained by reduced automobile sales and the generally
sluggish pace of retail sales.
With consumer type time and savings deposits inflows likely
to remain relatively large, banks can be expected to channel more of
their funds into securities, and to continue less aggressive in the CD
market. Short-term markets in the U.S. might also benefit from invest-
ment of oil revenues, depending, of course, on international rate rela-
tionships. With reduced business borrowing in the commercial paper
market, as well as the projected modest need for funds by the Treasury
and the Federal agencies, market factors may be placing some downward
pressures on short-term rates.
Capital market financing, on the other hand, is likely to remain
large as corporations fund their short-term obligations and finance the
expected high level of capital outlays during a period of reduced internal
funds generation. In the mortgage market, fund availability appears ade-
quate relative to demand, but demand by builders and buyers of housing is
being restrained by economic uncertainty. Such uncertainty could moderate
the rate of growth of new commitments, although seasonal factors will be
increasing demand in the period ahead. The level of other market rates
suggests that mortgage lenders will be likely to attempt to increase mort-
gage credit flows more by easing non-price terms and conditions than by
further reduction in interest rates.

II -4
Monetary aggregates. M1 in February is estimated to have
increased at almost a 13 per cent annual rate, following a decline in
January. The growth of M1 in December through February suggests that
the January decline may have been a random event; the average 5.5 per
cent growth rate for these three months appears to be more reflective
of underlying Ml expansion than individual monthly movements.
The December and January patterns of M1 change were
accentuated by movements in foreign bank and foreign official deposits.
The February increase in M1, on the other hand, was broadly based
geographically and by size of bank, and apparently was associated with
a sharp decline in U.S. Government deposits--the largest in the history
of the series. A reduction as large as this in Treasury deposits could
be expected to have a significant temporary impact on private demand
deposits. This would be particularly true when the reduction is
associated with large personal income tax refunds as in February, since
individuals are likely to adjust the imbalances less rapidly than
corporations.
Reflecting entirely the surge in Ml, growth in M2 and M3
accelerated in February. Time deposits other than CD's at large banks
continued to expand relatively rapidly, while deposit inflows at S&L's
and mutual savings banks stayed well below the pace at commercial banks.
However, data from a special monthly member bank survey suggest that
this recent more rapid growth in the "other time" component of M2
relative to deposit growth at thrift institutions may have been

accounted for primarily by balances other than consumer accounts. The
survey showed that in January, close to two-thirds of the growth in
the "other time" component of M2 at member banks (not seasonally
adjusted) was in deposits with denominations of $100,000 or more other
than large-bank negotiable CDs,1/ with four-year certificates account-
ing for most of the remainder.2/ February data from the special survey
are not yet available, but it is possible that the continued strength
of "other time deposits" in February, relative to the thrift institu-
tions, could have reflected further expansion in these large denomina-
tion deposits.
Although on a monthly average basis outstanding CD's at large
commercial banks also increased substantially in February, they
declined $1.1 billion from the last Wednesday of January to the last
Wednesday of February. This run-off appears to have been mainly in
response to continued rapid inflows of other time and savings deposits,
but may also relate to expectations of further easing in monetary
policy and near-term availability of funds at lower rates.
1/ These deposits would include non-negotiable time deposits in
denominations of $100,000 or more issued by weekly reporting banks and
negotiable and non-negotiable time deposits in these large
denominations issued by non-weekly reporting banks.
2/ The January survey results will be discussed in more detail in the
Supplement.

Although there was a sharp increase in private demand deposits
and in time and savings deposits other than CD's, as well as a modest
increase in nondeposit sources of funds, the sharp decline in Treasury
deposits over the month lowered growth in the member bank adjusted
credit proxy to the lowest rate since 1970.
Bank credit. Despite the slow growth of the daily average
adjusted member bank credit proxy, the all commercial bank last-
Wednesday-of-the-month series shows that bank credit grew in February
almost as rapidly as in January. Bank holdings of Treasury issues
declined considerably less than seasonally, with banks increasing
appreciably their holdings of coupon issues, apparently through partici-
pation in the February refunding. Total loans increased only moderately
less than in January, but the composition of loan growth was
considerably different.

Business loan growth in February moderated from the January
pace, but still remained unusually large given the high cost of bank
credit relative to the cost of borrowing in the commercial paper market.
The prime rate, although it dropped 75 basis points in February, was
substantially higher than the 30-59 day commercial paper rate through
most of the month, but the spread narrowed considerably in early March.
Nonfinancial businesses also continued to borrow large amounts in the
commercial paper market in February, and their total short-term
borrowing was well above the average for the second half of 1973. 1/
Such credit demands may reflect substantial outlays for inventory
accumulation and other investment, including adjustments necessitated
by the fuel shortage, in a period of reduced corporate cash flows.
Loans to nonbank financial institutions expanded quite
moderately in February. Moreover, these institutions obtained no
additional funds in the commercial paper market. Their reduced short-
term credit needs apparently were associated with the continued weakness
in sales of automobiles and other consumer durables, as well as some
repayment of short-term debt from the proceeds of capital market
financing.
1/ The February 15, 1974, Lending Practices Survey indicates that nearly
half of the respondents expect loan demand to weaken in the next
three months. An appenidix in the Supplement will discuss the survey
results.

The rate of growth in real estate loans at commercial banks
in February dropped to about half the January rate, a sharp departure
from the gradual deceleration in recent months. A Reserve Bank survey
of weekly reporting banks, however, suggests that this drop was not
accompanied by a large reduction in the flow of bank credit for real
estate financing. Instead, it was largely attributable to mortgage
loan sales--including sales to S&L's that have been experiencing
difficulty in finding mortages to absorb their increased deposit

II -11
inflows--and loan reclassifications at a small number of banks in the
1/2/Northeast and South.
Security loans rose sharply in February--$1.5 billion, sea-
sonally adjusted. About one-half of this increase appears to have
been associated with the rise in inventories of U.S. Government
security dealers growing out of the February refunding. However, the
reason for the surge in other security loans is not clear since
corporate and municipal bond dealer positions were unchanged or lower
in February.
1/ The survey indicated that one large New York City bank had sold
almost $100 million in mortgage loans, for example, and accounted
for all the weakness in real estate loans in the District. The
Atlanta District's weakness can likewise be attributed to a single
bank which re-classified $60 million of outstanding real estate
loans to other categories.
2/ The reduction in growth for loans other than business loans is
overstated to an indeterminate degree by loan sales in February.
Sales of loans other than business loans are not reported by type,
and hence no adjustment can be made in these other categories.
The volume of sales of loans other than business loans was
unusually large in February--$500 million.

II -12
Nonbank financial intermediaries. Following a $2.2 billion
net savings inflow in January, S&L's received an estimated additional
$1.6 billion in February. On a seasonally adjusted basis, these inflows
translate into annual growth rates of 9.8 per cent and 8.5 per cent,
respectively.
Flows into mutual savings banks picked up during February,
resulting in an estimated seasonally adjusted annualized growth rate
of 5.5 per cent--considerably above the weak January pace.

The 4-year certificate account continues to attract the major
portion of savings inflows at S&L's. According to confidential FHLBB
estimates, these accounts comprised nearly 10 per cent of total savings
at large S&L's at the end of January. Although most of the inflow in
recent months has been into 4-year accounts, there are indications that
some institutions are beginning to bid less actively for these funds.
There have been reports of noticeably less advertising by many institu-
tions (including several New York MSB's) and in some cases, S&L's have

II -13
lowered the offering rate on 4-year accounts to 7.00 per cent from 7.50
per cent.
During February, S&L's repaid $285 million in FHLB adances--
the first decline in outstanding advances since January 1973. Repay-
ments of borrowed money, in conjunction with continued additions to
liquid assets, have strengthened the liquidity position of these insti-
tutions. The liquidity ratio (cash and investment securities divided
by the sum of savings capital and borrowings) at S&L's was 9.1 per cent
in January, somewhat below the 10.5 per cent average achieved during
the first half of 1973, but substantially above the current required
minimum of 5.5 per cent.
Consumer credit. Seasonally adjusted growth in total con-
sumer credit outstanding recovered somewhat in January, but even so,
the $9.5 billion annual rate of increase was the second smallest in
two years. Increases in the three major components of instalment debt
exceeded their sharply reduced December rates, but these were partly
offset in the total by a $1.5 billion rate of decline in noninstalment
credit outstanding.
Instalment credit outstanding increased at an $11 billion
annual rate in January, double the December rate, as "other consumer
goods" and personal loans expanded rapidly. Automobile credit, which
had declined slightly in December, edged higher again in January, but
the gain was still far below the rate of increase in any recent quarter.
Other consumer goods credit rose at an annual rate of $5.6 billion in
January, with a record two-fifths of the rise accounted for by open-end
accounts in the form of bank credit-card balances outstanding. Personal

II -14
loans were up at a $4.5 billion annual rate--the only type of credit to
increase faster than in the last half of 1973. To some extent the
strength in personal loans may be related to the rising burden of con-
sumer debt, as indicated by the record ratio of total consumer credit
outstanding to disposable personal income of 19.4 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1973, up from 18.6 per cent a year earlier, and the
further recent uptrend in consumer credit delinquency rates.
Rates on new car loans financed through major auto finance
companies edged down 3 basis points in January to 12.39 per cent, the
first decline in this series in almost a year.

Short-term interest rates. At the time of the February FOMC
meeting, the market generally expected a further near-term easing in
monetary policy; and short-term rates, which had been declining since
early December, were at levels that could be substained only by a further
drop in the Federal funds rate. These expectations, however, were shaken
by subsequent developments, such as the persistence of the funds rate at
about 9 per cent, Congressional testimony by Chairman Burns, the precipitous
rise in the money stock during the first three weeks of February, and some
recent evidence that the economy is not slowing as much as market partici-
pants had expected. As a consequence, many market participants have con-
cluded that the System will not encourage a further significant drop in
the funds rate over the near-term, and most rates have adjusted upward.
Treasury bill rates, which have been rather volatile in recent
months, rebounded most sharply, rising 65 to 100 basis points. Several
special influences have added to the upward pressure on bill yields.
For example, the System has reduced its bill holdings by nearly $1.0
billion through sales and redemptions since the last FOMC meeting, partly
to absorb funds released by the sharp decline in the Treasury balance
at the Fed in late February and early March. Also, the Treasury auc-
tioned $1.5 billion of reopened April TABs on February 26; although
this offering was expected by the market, it was not well received.
Further, with bill yields generally one to two percentage points below
dealer borrowing costs, the resulting large negative carry on dealer
positions has been an additional source of market pressure. On the
other hand, foreign accounts brought about $400 million of bills during
the inter-meeting period.

II -16
Private short-term rates have risen about 1/4 to 1/2 of a percent-
age point, reflecting not only the recent shift in market expectations
but also strong business credit demands at banks and in the commercial
paper market. The lagging bank prime rate, on the other hand, has
declined to a general level of 8-3/4 per cent--with a few banks as low
as 8-1/2 per cent--in reaction to the interest rate declines that had
taken place earlier.
Treasury coupon market. Yields on Treasury coupon issues rose
slightly in the week before the last meeting and have risen another 15
to 35 basis point since then. For example, prices of the three new
issues in the February refunding are now all between 1-1/3 and 2 points
below the levels at which they were issued. Moreover, the coupon market
remains in a somewhat vulnerable position. Dealer coupon inventories,
initially enlarged by awards of the new issues, were distributed rather
slowly during the refunding period and still are almost double their
1973 average. Also, dealers have become more aggressive in seeking to
reduce their positions, and these efforts have given an added impetus
to the most recent yield advances.
Looking ahead, the Treasury may need to raise about $3.0 billion
of new money in early April--possibly $2.0 billion through a 2-year note
and $1.0 billion through a June TAB. Additional new money may need to
be raised in early June. It should be noted that foreign redemptions
of special issues have continued to subside, amounting to less than
$50 million, net, over the past month.
In the Agency market, there has been little change in financing
plans since the February Greenbook.

Long-term securities markets. Long-term interest rates have
increased since the February FOMC meeting, with rates on corporate issues
showing the largest advance--about 30 basis points. Dealers in this
market had been holding substantial inventories in anticipation of
price increases. As yields began to rise, however, inventories were
liquidated, thereby intensifying downward pressure on prices. In the
municipal market, inventory levels have remained relatively high, and
the rise in yields has been somewhat smaller.

Rumors of an end to the Arab oil boycott and the belief that
the decline in energy related stocks had proceeded too far apparently
caused investors to bid up stock prices during the last three weeks of
February and in early March. The rally has been broadly based, with
stock of many small companies participating. At first, trading volume
was light, but has increased recently with the continuing rise in
prices.
Total corporate security offerings in March are expected to
increase more than $1 billion above the February level to $4.1 billion.
In April, total offerings are expected to decline only moderately.
The build-up is accounted for by increases in. both bond and stock
offerings. The projected level of public bond offerings is particularly
large, with the March and April volume expected to be more than twice
the monthly average for 1973. The volume of stock offerings also is
expected to increase in March and April but to remain below 1973 levels.

An Analysis of the industrial composition of public bond flota-
tions indicates that offerings by manufacturing, public utility, and
banks and other financial firms have increased substantially beginning
in the fourth quarter of 1973. While the volume of public utility bond
issues in the first quarter of this year will be more than twice that
of the comparable period a year ago, issues of banks and financial firms
will be nearly triple. For manufacturing firms the rate of increase is
the greatest, with offerings rising from $85 million in the first quarter
of 1973 to over $700 million in the current quarter. Utilities have
needed long term funds not only to finance a substantial expansion
of capacity, but also to fund short term debt and restore reduced
liquidity positions. Although liquidity positions of banks and manu-
facturing firms are more comfortable, these firms too have felt the need
to restructure balance sheets and finance expansion.
The level of municipal offerings is expected to increase in
March largely because of special revenue bond issues, and then show a
slight decline in April. While casualty insurance companies reportedly
have continued to acquire municipals at about the same pace as last year,
bank purchases of municipals have picked up in recent months.

Mortgage market. The supply of residential mortgage funds
has continued to improve, but demand for mortgage loans by builders
and potential buyers has remained relatively slack for this time of
year. However, interest rates and non-rate terms have eased only
slightly further. Both the volume of new mortgage commitments and
the backlog of outstanding commitments at savings and loan associations
changed little in February after seasonal adjustment, according to
tentative estimates. By January, S&L new mortgage commitments were
still running about 40 per cent below the peak rate a year earlier,
and outstanding commitments were about 25 per cent below the high
reached in February 1973.
Contract interest rates on new commitments for 80 per cent
conventional home loans at selected S&L's have continued gradually
downward in most recent weeks, and on March 8 averaged 8.41 per cent--
44 basis points below the September peak but still significantly
above prevailing usury ceilings in 10 states and the District of
Columbia. With 8-1/4 per cent FHA-and VA- underwritten mortgages
currently selling within about 2 points of par in the secondary
market, there is an expectation in the trade of a small further cut
in the maximum contract rate on these loans.
Due partly to increases in yields on new issues of high-grade
utility bonds, the average gross yield spread favoring home mortgages

II -23
over such securities recently narrowed further. After allowance for
their higher servicing costs, these mortgages--whether originated
directly or purchased in the secondary market--now offer no net
investment incentive over such bonds for diversified lenders.
Savings and loan associations now report that funds for
home mortgages are in adequate supply relative to demand in all 12 of
the FHLBank Districts--in sharp contrast with the situation last
August when all Districts reported funds in short supply. With improve-
ments in the supply of funds, some loosening of nonrate terms occurred
as lenders attempted to attract home mortgage borrowers at interest
rates which are still high by historical standards. For example,
about 70 per cent of S&L's were offering 90 per cent 25-year financing
for the purchase of new homes in February, up from 53 per cent in
October but still well below the 85 per cent offering such contracts
early last year.
Delinquency rates on home mortgages (Mortgage Bankers
Association series) declined slightly from the September high and at
year-end averaged 4.3 per cent of outstanding loans held by reporting
institutions, after seasonal adjustment. Delinquency rates continued
to be particularly high for FHA-insured mortgages, and averaged
almost 15 per cent for loans associated with the Sec. 235 interest-
rate subsidy program which was suspended last year.

Agricultural finance. Through January, the cooperative
Farm Credit System agencies continued to show high levels of both new
loans and repayments, in short-term and mortgage lending alike. This
experience appears to reflect simultaneous sharp increases in farmers'
costs, receipts, and net income. Receipts from farm marketing reached

II -25
a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $108 billion in the last quarter
of 1973, 57 per cent above the 1972 average. On the same basis,
production expenses were 58 per cent higher, which still permitted
total net farm income to rise by 55 per cent.
The Department of Agriculture (USDA) has revised its estimate
of the 1973 increase in total farm debt upward to $9.3 billion (estimate
published in December was $7.5 billion). At the revised level, the
net addition to farm debt surpassed by 29 per cent the previous record
gain in 1972 and was about double the average annual increase during
1968-72. The debt increase projected by the USDA for 1974 has been
revised upward to $11.9 billion, which would raise total farm debt
to $93.1 billion at year-end.

II-26
Federal finance. The staff's budget forecasts for the current
fiscal year have not been substantially altered since the February
Greenbook. The receipts projection is essentially the same at $267.2
billion, while the forecast of outlays has been lowered by $0.7 billion
to $271.3 billion, primarily reflecting an apparent shortfall in
expenditures during February. The resulting $4.1 billion deficit is
slightly less than the Administration's $4.7 billion estimate, which
reflects projected outlays of $274.7 billion and receipts of $270.0
billion.
During the past month, however, there have been several legis-
lative developments related to the energy crisis that could have
significant effects on the budget, particularly in fiscal year 1975.
The recent Senate failure to override the President's veto of the energy
bill which would have rolled back gasoline prices may have given alterna-
tive proposals, such as the Administration's emergency excess profits
tax, a new lease on life. In view of the diversity of tax proposals
in this area, however, the staff's Greenbook projection does not
include a revenue allowance for such measures.
The President's energy message proposes to increase greatly
the acreage allotment for offshore oil drilling. The resulting increase
in rents and royalties from the previously projected level of $5
billion (recorded as negative outlays in the unified budget) could
reduce the estimated unified budget deficit in fiscal year 1975
by several billion dollars. (These transactions do not affect the NIA
budget.)

II -27
Several bills extending unemployment benefits are pending
in Congress; but our forecast does not include any additional spending
for such transfers mainly because of uncertainty about passage, given
the substantive differences in pending legislation. The Administration's
February 13 proposal would extend unemployment benefits 13 weeks in
areas experiencing high unemployment. It would also provide 26 weeks
of benefits for workers in industries not previously covered by unem-
ployment insurance. One point of major Congressional opposition to
this proposal arises from the fact that it is appended to legislation
submitted last year which would prevent strikers from collecting
unemployment benefits.
With regard to public service employment, on February 8,
Senator Javits co-sponsored the Emergency Energy Employment Act of 1974,
which authorizes up to $4 billion to be appropriated for this purpose
in fiscal years 1974 and 1975. All these funds would become available
if the national (seasonally adjusted) unemployment rate were to exceed
6 per cent for three consecutive months. This measure reportedly
could provide as many as 500,000 jobs during the period. At this time,
however, our spending estimates include only the $350 million program
provided in the budget for fiscal year 1975.
During February the average tax and loan balance (seasonally
adjusted) declined $3.2 billion. The cash balance is projected to
remain at a low level through early April. A comparison of this year
with previous years indicates that the low level of borrowing during
February (actually a $0.2billion net redemption) partly accounted for

II -28
the large decline. Other contributing factors were relatively high
personal tax refunds and an increase in deposits at the Federal Reserve.
Personal tax refunds in February are now estimated to have
totaled $1.8 billion, or $0.7 billion more than in February 1973; they
averaged $365 per payment. Based on early March IRS reports we currently
are estimating that such refunds will total $8 billion during this month,
as compared to $6.8 billion a year earlier. The faster processing of
refunds this year suggests that a smaller percentage of such checks
will be paid during late May and early June compared to last year.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. The U.S. dollar, after appreciating
against leading foreign currencies by about 15 percent (trade-
weighted basis) from October through late January, depreciated about
5 percent during the first three weeks of February. During the
past three weeks, it has shown little net change. It is now down
about 15 percent from its May 1970 level.
The U.S. payments balance on the official settlements basis
has shown a roughly corresponding movement. The large surplus in
January ($3.1 billion, not seasonally adjusted) was followed by a
deficit of about $1/2 billion in February, judging by preliminary
weekly data, with most of this occurring early in the month.
The weakening of the dollar in February probably reflected
a shift in net flows of short-term private capital. There had been
substantial net inflows late last year and in January. These
apparently diminished, or gave way to net outflows, in February.
Factors that would have contributed to such a shift included the
removal of U.S. capital controls at the end of January, relaxation
by several foreign countries of restraints on capital inflows, and
a decline in U.S. interest rates during February while rates abroad
remained high.

III -2
Monetary authorities in most industrial countries are
continuing to follow very restrictive policies. Recent reappraisals
of the economic outlook abroad have led most observers to be somewhat
less gloomy about the adverse impact of the oil crisis on economic
activity, but also somewhat more pessimistic about the possibility
of bringing inflation under early control.
In January, the U.S. trade surplus was still large, though
down moderately from the exceptionally large December surplus. The
trade balance is expected to shrink during the months ahead as U.S.
imports more fully reflect higher oil prices.
Gross capital flows into and out of the United States
are expected to be large this year, but there is still little basis
for predicting how they and the current account may balance out.
In exchange markets there seems to be no strong feeling that the
dollar will move very much further in either direction.
The increasing flow of funds to oil-exporting countries
is apparently still being placed mainly in the Euro-dollar market.
Demands for medium-term credit in that market, including demands
by governments, have greatly increased in recent weeks, and Euro-
dollar rates have risen. Evidently this market will be handling
much of the recycling of funds between oil-exporters and oil-
importers for some time to come.

III -3
Foreign exchange markets. In the first three weeks of February
the dollar depreciated by an average of nearly 5 per cent under the influence
of declining U.S. interest rates, the elimination or relaxation of capital
controls by the U.S. and most major foreign countries, and adverse price
and output developments in the U.S. economy. In the past three weeks,
the dollar has on balance held steady, despite occasional erratic fluc-
tuations.
During February and so far in March foreign central bank inter-
vention has been largely confined to Italy, Canada and the United Kingdom.
The Bank of Italy made total intervention sales of $1 billion in February
and has continued to intervene on the same scale in March. During this
period the lira has depreciated sharply against other continental European
currencies while appreciating slightly against the dollar, influenced by
political instability, worsening inflation and a deteriorating payments
position in Italy. Half of the Italian intervention sales in February
were financed out of reserves while the other half were financed from
state-controlled borrowing in the Euro-dollar market and by swaps with
Italian commercial banks.
The Bank of Canada took in $360 million in February to hold
down a rise in the Canadian dollar resulting mainly from an increase in
Canadian relative to U.S. interest rates. So far in March interest rate
differentials have moved in favor of the U.S. and the Canadian dollar has
eased, prompting net intervention sales of $50 million by the Bank of
Canada.

III -4
The pound received a total of $200 million intervention support
from the Bank of England during February and a further $200 million on
March 1 following the U.K. general election. Subsequently the pound has
firmed to $2.34, an increase of 6 cents from its level of four weeks ago,
influenced by a tightening in the U.K. money market.
The System intervened on four days in late February and early
March selling marks and, on one occasion, French and Belgian francs at
times when the dollar was experiencing downward pressure in the New York
market.
The Bank of Japan has not intervened in the Tokyo market since
late January. During January, the yen received a total of $1.7 billion
in intervention support to keep the dollar from rising above the 300 yen/$
level. Since then the yen has floated upward against the dollar, rising
to a current level of 283 yen/$.
The gold price has fluctuated downward in March after a specu-
lative jump of nearly 40 per cent in February. Gold shot up from $130
on February 1 to a peak of $180 on February 27 in very active trading.
In recent weeks the price has fluctuated erratically between $160 and
$170 and in recent days has held just below $165.
Euro-dollar market. Since mid-February Euro-dollar rates have
reversed part of their sharp decline begun the month before. The 3-month
deposit rate averaged 8.79 per cent in the week of March 13, up 40 basis
points from one month earlier, and over the same period the overnight
rate advanced 30 points to an average of 8.54 per cent in the latest week.
While U.S. CD and Federal funds rates also showed net increases over the

period the increases in the Euro-dollar rates were larger, at least partly
because of extraordinarily heavy demand for medium-term Euro-dollar loans.
The excess of the 3-month Euro-dollar rate over the 60-89 day U.S. CD
rate -- which had contracted to one-quarter percentage point by mid-February -
widened to around one-half percentage point in the week of March 13. The
cost to banks of overnight Euro-dollars, adjusted for reserve requirements,
was about 35 basis points above the Federal funds rate in the latest week.
(Beginning March 14, reserve free bases were entirely eliminated).
The yield advantage of Euro-dollar deposit rates over comparable
U.S. rates apparently led to a sizable outflow of U.S. funds into Euro-
dollar deposits immediately following the removal of U.S. capital controls
on January 29. Several sources report that U.S. investors (including

thrift institutions and corporations) placed about $1 billion in CD's and
deposits with banks in London, particularly branches of U.S. banks, between
January 29 and about mid-February. In addition to the higher yields
obtainable in London these U.S. investors are said to have been attracted
by the availability there of CD's in the 1 to 5 year maturity range. No
official data are yet available with which to evaluate these reports, nor
do we know on what scale this flow may be continuing.
The cost of bank credit has remained lower in the Euro-dollar
market than in the United States (allowing for the cost of compensating balances
but not for reserve requirements on foreign branch loans to U.S. residents).
although the gap has narrowed in the past month with the rise in Euro-dollar
rates and the further drop in the U.S. prime rate. For prime borrowers
the cost of short-term dollar loans in the Euro-market averaged about 9.25
per cent in the week of March 13, compared with 10.3 or 10.9 per cent
in the United States with 15 or 20 per cent compensating balances, respectively.

III -7
Such differentials help to explain why the termination of the VFCR has
been followed by a decline rather than a rise in claims on foreigners
reported by the weekly reporting banks. They are also consistent with
reports that the end of the Foreign Direct Investment Program has not
resulted in more than modest repayments of foreign loans by U.S. direct
investors. What repayments have occurred may reflect the lower cost of
borrowing in the commercial paper market here compared with the costs of
either U.S. or Euro-dollar bank loans.
In the rapidly expanding market for medium-term (over one year)
Euro-dollar loans, demand for credit has soared to record levels in recent
weeks. According to World Bank estimates, from very late January to the
end of February loan agreements were signed for $5.2 billion of new medium-
term loans; for January and February together commitments averaged $3.6
billion a month compared with the already high $2.5 billion monthly average
in the latt half of 1973. In these two months French public sector
borrowers obtained commitments for $2.0 billion in an effort to shield
official reserves from the effects of higher oil prices, and Italian state
enterprises also agreed to borrow $2.0 billion (of which $1.2 billion by
Mediobanca) in reflection of continuing Italian payments difficulties.
Early in March three French public sector entities raised another $260
million and the Greater London Council $500 million; the latter followed
an earlier $500 million loan this year to the British Electricity Council,
as Britain continued to encourage external borrowing to avoid reserve
losses or depreciation of the pound.

III -8
U.S. balance of payments. In February, the official settle-
ments balance is estimated to have slipped back into a deficit for the
month of about $1/2 billion (not seasonally adjusted, not at annual rate),
following substantial surpluses in the fourth quarter and January. As
U.S. capital controls were removed and interest rates in the United States
declined, the net inflow of short-term funds probably slowed markedly
from the very heavy inflow recorded in the fourth quarter and through
mid-January. With the concurrent weakening of the dollar against most
foreign currencies that began in late January, partly in consequence of
these reduced inflows, foreign central banks, which had been selling
dollars heavily, either withdrew from the exchange market or began to
buy dollars in moderate amounts.
Information on specific components of the balance of payments
for January is still very partial. The trade balance was again in large
surplus in January -- $560 million (seasonally adjusted, not at an
annual rate ) -- down moderately from the exceptionally large surplus of
$665 million in December, as imports rose more sharply than exports.
About two-thirds of the increase in the value of imports stemmed from
a 30 percent rise in the price of imported oil. The trade balance can
be expected to weaken further in the coming months as U.S. imports more
fully reflect higher oil prices announced by the oil-exporting countries
in December and the higher Canadian tax on oil exports to the United States
that became effective on February 1.

sharply in December, increased further in January but by a much smaller
amount -- less than $300 million (not seasonally adjusted, not at an
annual rate). Long-term claims actually declined by a small amount but
short-term claims rose by over $350 million. However, these short-term
outflows of bank credit in January were more than offset by an inflow
of funds in the form of additions to bank-reported liabilities to banks
and nonbanks abroad.
The net inflow on private securities transactions in January
was about as small as in December. U.S. purchases of foreign bonds,
especially new Canadian provincial issues, increased substantially from
December to January. Foreign net purchases of U.S. stocks also increased;
they were $174 million, compared with a small net sale in December. The
January purchases were credited principally to France, Switzerland and
the Netherlands, with the bulk of the purchases made through branches of
U.S. brokerage firms in these countries; some of these may have been
for the account of the Middle Eastern oil-exporting countries. Foreign
net purchases of U.S. bonds in January were about the same as in December;
purchases of Eurobond issues of U.S. corporations fell sharply, but this
decline was just about offset by higher net purchases of other types of
U.S. bonds.

U.S. foreign trade. In January the U.S. trade balance was
again in large surplus -- $6-3/4 billion at an annual rate (balance of
payments basis) -- down only moderately from the high surplus recorded
in December. January was the fifth consecutive month of trade surplus;
the surplus has ranged from a monthly low of $3.0 billion (November)
to a high of $8.0 billion (December).
In real terms -- 1967 dollars -- the monthly movement in both
exports and imports has been quite erratic over the past five months
but exports have generally grown more rapidly than imports, particularly
in December and January.

The considerable difference in the size of the trade surplus
in nominal and real terms indicates the strong influence of the
differential rise in export and import prices. In January the excess
of the surplus in real terms over that in nominal terms widened some-
what as prices of imports rose faster than prices of exports. During
the last five months of surplus (September 1973 to January 1974), export
prices rose at an annual rate of 31 percent, slightly higher than the
27 percent rate of increase from January through August 1973. The
acceleration in the prices of imports has been much greater -- 50
percent at an annual rate in the last five months, double the rate of
increase in the earlier months of 1973.
The rate of increase in prices of exports of nonagricultural
commodities increased very sharply from September to January, by
30 percent at an annual rate, compared with a less than 15 percent
rate of increase from January to August 1973. Prices of the two
major components of nonagricultural exports -- capital equipment and
industrial materials -- both increased steeply in the more recent
period. In contrast, the rate of price increase for agricultural exports
from September to January slowed markedly to less than half the
75 percent annual rate of increase in the first eight months of 1973.

For imports, the recent acceleration in prices largely reflects
the higher oil prices set by the oil-producing countries in the last
quarter of 1973. From September to January the price of imported fuels
more than doubled, going from an average price of about $3.35 per barrel
(crude and refined products) to over $7.10 per barrel in January.
Further increases can be expected in February and March as the price
increases announced by the oil-supplying countries at the end of
December and the increase on February 1 in the Canadian export tax on
crude oil (from $2.20 to $6.40 per barrel) are more fully reflected in
the value of imports. The volume of U.S. imports of oil has declined,
as a result of the Arab embargo, from an average of 6.5 million barrels
per day in January-September 1973 to less than 6 million barrels per day
this past January, and even less in February (particularly in the early

III -13
part of the month) according to weekly data of the American Petroleum
Institute. The value of imports over this period, however, has risen
from $7 to $14 billion (annual rate). If the oil embargo were to be
lifted by the end of March so that an additional million barrels of
oil per day could be imported at an estimated price of $10 per barrel,
the value of fuel imports this year could be more than $2 billion higher
than the current estimate of $21 billion.

Prices of imports other than fuel rose on average at an annual
rate of 16 percent from September to January, down from the 25 percent
rate of increase posted in the earlier months of 1973, although prices
of industrial materials (other than fuels) continued to rise at a rate
of 35 percent. The appreciation of the dollar in exchange markets between

III -14
October and January may well have been a factor in slowing the rise
in these prices expressed in terms of dollars while the equivalent
prices in terms of the currencies of other industrial countries rose
more.
Although import movements in recent months have been dominated
by the developments in oil, the January trade data suggest that imports
of cars may have begun to respond to the shift in domestic demand toward
smaller cars. Imports of cars from Europe and Japan in January rose
very strongly, exceeding the number of such cars sold in the United States
by a considerable amount and permitting some rebuilding of inventories
that had been drawn down last year. Although sales of foreign cars in
the United States in January and February were relatively low -- 1.6
million units at an annual rate -- a continuation of imports at the
January level would suggest a rise in domestic sales of these foreign
cars.

III -15
Monetary and credit conditions in major industrial countries.
With inflationary pressures remaining very strong in all industrial
countries, most countries -- except for Italy and Canada -- are con-
tinuing to pursue tight monetary policies. In many countries in recent
weeks, however, these policies appear to have ceased becoming pro-
gressively tighter. In both Italy and Canada, monetary policy can be
characterized as one of moderate accommodation rather than restraint.
The recent rise in oil prices can be viewed as having a one-time
impact on general price levels, except that it may be adding to wage-
push pressures. But underlying upward pressures on prices remain strong,
and it is for this reason that most authorities are continuing to maintain
relatively tight demand management policies. There is considerable
concern about the spring round of wage negotiations in some countries.
A number of countries, including Germany, France, Switzerland,
Belgium and Japan have relaxed their curbs on the inflow of capital or
taken action (other than on interest rates) to encourage inflows. Such
actions reflect concern about a weakening in the balance of payments as
a result of higher payments for oil imports.
There are some signs of a slowdown in monetary and credit
expansion in recent months. Although the rates of increase remain high
in some countries, M1 growth in the latter part of 1973 was slower in
Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Japan than it had been
last spring. Because the earlier rapid growth in credit and money produced

III -16
high liquidity ratios for the private sector, most monetary authorities
are reluctant to implement expansionary policies at this time.
As indicated in the table on the following page, both short-
term and long-term interest rates are at relatively high levels in most
countries. Except in the U.K., Germany and Canada, short-term rates
have increased in recent months. Long-term rates have increased in
recent months for all countries, and the rates are particularly high in
the U.K., France and Germany.
At present, the outlook is for the maintenance of relatively
tight monetary and credit conditions in most countries in the coming
months. No significant easing of monetary policies is likely to occur
until there is a marked slackening in domestic demand pressures or a
significant downturn in international commodity prices.
Germany has been pursuing a tight monetary policy since the
autumn of 1972 and is likely to continue this policy in view of the
absence thus far of as much weakening in economic activity as had been
expected earlier, and because of the relatively large increase in wages
(an effective rise of about 12.5 per cent) granted to the public service
workers in February. The wage boost exceeded the government's guideline
of 9-1/2 per cent. In order to avoid a severe squeeze on bank liquidity,
the Bundesbank in January reduced the reserve requirements on bank
liabilities to both residents and non-residents. At the same time, the
Bundesbank underscored its intention not to undertake any net relaxation

of monetary policy by terminating the special Lombard loan facility that
had been activated at the end of November.
At the end of January, the authorities lifted or relaxed most
of the barriers to free movements of capital except for the ban on interest
payments by German banks on liabilities to non-residents and the restric-
tions on non-resident purchases of short-term debt assets. The Bardepot
law also remains in effect, but the deposit requirement has been reduced
from 50 to 20 per cent and the amount of a given loan exempt from the
requirement has been raised from 50,000 to 100,000 DM. The main factors
prompting these actions were the general strengthening of the dollar and
the expectation that Germany's basic balance of payments would not registar
a surplus this year because of the increase in oil prices.
Although there is very little excess liquidity in German
money markets, the extremely tight conditions of last spring and summer
have not recurred in recent months. There has been some softening in
private loan demand as a result of the slowdown in business activity.
Primarily because of reduced demands for credit, short-term
interest rates have been declining in recent months. Long-term yields,
however, increased in February as bond holders sold in anticipation of
rising long-term rates.
In the United Kingdom the Bank of England's efforts to slow
the growth of monetary aggregates have been interrupted by the temporary

III -19
economic disruption in the country. Although the Bank of England intro-
duced a new Special Deposit scheme in mid-December with the aim of making
the Bank's control over the money stock more effective, the Bank hesitated
to restrict the banking system too vigorously. Instead, it tried to
ensure that the banks were sufficiently liquid to help those non-banks
whose liquidity might be adversely affected by a reduced cash flow
stemming from the three-day work week (which was terminated March 8),
and those fringe banks threatened by a crisis of confidence. Three-
month market rates of interest have been in the neighborhood of 15 per
cent.
Bank liquidity was under pressure in the second half of January
when the Government experienced a larger surplus than had been expected.
This caused a further rise in short-term interest rates, which led the
Bank of England to repay in early February a part -- 0.5 per cent of
bank deposits -- of the Special Deposits that had been placed with the
Bank. As a consequence, short-term rates dropped back a little. The
Bank of England's minimum lending rate decreased from 12.75 to 12.50
per cent on February 1.
Long-term bond yields have been rising persistently during
the past year, presumably reflecting an increasing premium for infla-
tionary expectations.
Bank credit to the private sector expanded at a relatively
high rate last year, while the monetary aggregates registered somewhat

III -20
divergent trends. The broad version of the money supply, M3, increased
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 25 per cent from July
through mid-January. In contrast, the narrow version of money supply,
Ml, fell during that period after having increased moderately during
the previous six months.
The new Labor Government acted quickly to end the miners' strike
and to restore the normal work week. The Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Denis Healey, will announce the Budget for 1974/75 on March 26. If, as
is generally believed, the public sector borrowing requirement is sig-
nificantly reduced, attempts by the Bank of England to slow the growth
of M3 may become more successful.
France has been pursuing a progressively tighter monetary policy
during the past year and a half. Bank credit ceilings have been steadily
tightened, and in mid-January reserve requirements against resident
deposits were increased further by 2 percentage points. At the same
time, reserve requirements against non-resident deposits were abolished
in order to encourage an inflow of short-term capital.
In contrast to the high degree of business liquidity that still
prevailed during much of 1973, businessmen in January reported that their
cash positions were much tighter. Banks and other financial institutions
have been reporting that their financing conditions have become difficult
since they are being pressured for both domestic and export investment
credits at the same time that higher corporate and personal income tax
payments are falling due.

III -21
The tighter credit conditions have contributed to a sharp
rise in French interest rates during the past six months, although some
rates have recently eased. The call money rate recently stood at about
12 per cent, down from a brief high of 15 per cent in January, but still
above the 11 to 11-1/2 per cent rate prevailing during the fourth quarter
of last year. Long-term rates are also at record levels, with the yield
on public sector bonds exceeding 10 per cent.
French monetary policy is likely to remain restrictive in the
coming months, but further tightening appears unlikely. Some of the
demand for credit may be relieved by overseas borrowing, as well as a
tightening of controls on capital outflows.
Restrictions on French long-term credits from abroad have been
eased, and the French Treasury's $1.5 billion Euro-dollar loan has led
the way for similar smaller borrowings by French industry.
Italian monetary policy has remained relatively easy, as the
main concern of the authorities has been not to stifle the economic
recovery that began in mid-1972. The inflationary and balance-of-payments
situations have worsened substantially during the past 12 months.
Beginning in July of last year the authorities adopted several
measures in order to permit the expansionary monetary policy to continue.
These measures included a price freeze in July and a tightening of capital
controls on outflows of funds. In September the Bank of Italy raised
its basic discount rate from 4.0 to 6.5 per cent in order to bring its
lending rate to commercial banks more in line with market conditions.

III -22
Last year the Bank of Italy also undertook a series of measures --
including a ceiling on the rate of growth of bank credit -- aiming at
restricting speculation and channeling funds toward both small- and
medium-sized businesses, as well as toward productive enterprises.
In general, short-term money rates have been rising, while
long-term rates have been relatively stable. One indicator of money
market rates -- the interbank deposit rate -- increased from 7.75 per
cent in October 1973 to 9.6 per cent in February 1974. Yields on public
corporation bonds have remained relatively stable during the past year,
fluctuating generally between 7-1/2 and 7-3/4 per cent.
Any further restraint at this time is likely to result from
the delayed impact of measures taken last year, particularly the 12
per cent credit-ceiling measure. There are strong political and social
pressures opposing tightening measures. As a case in point, the coalition
government recently fell following the resignation of the Finance Minister,
who had earlier agreed to conditions attached to a proposed IMF drawing
that other cabinet members felt were too restrictive.
In Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands, the authorities
are generally pursuing tight money policies, although the Dutch have
taken some actions recently to mitigate the severe strains in the money
market. Short-term interest rates have been rising substantially, with
long-term rates moving up at a somewhat slower pace. In all three countries,
monetary and credit policies are likely to remain relatively tight in the
near future.

III -23
All three countries have recently eased or removed some of
their restraints on capital inflows. But the Swiss authorities are
trying to discourage capital inflows by restraining the rise in short-
term rates.
In Japan, monetary policy has been steadily tightened since
early last year. Reserve requirements have been raised six times since
then. On December 22 the Bank of Japan's basic discount rate was increased
an unprecedented 2 percentage points to 9.0 per cent. Late last month
commercial banks were ordered to restrict their credits for the financing
of land, distribution activities and unnecessarily high inventory ac-
cumulation. The authorities are likely to maintain their tight monetary
and fiscal policies until the rise in prices is slowed substantially.
Recent news reports,which may prove false, indicate that the Bank of
Japan plans to increase its discount rate again in March.
Large monthly deficits in the balance of payments since March
of 1973 have prompted the Government in recent months to revise its
foreign capital controls so as to encourage the inflow, and to discourage
the outflow, of capital.
Although credit conditions have tightened considerably in
recent months, loan demand continues strong. Much of this reflects
the demand for additional funds to bolster working capital, as well as
to make payments for goods at much higher prices. There are signs that
the rate of credit expansion has begun to slow down. During the last

III -24
half of 1973 bank credit increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 14 per cent as compared to 19 per cent in the first half of the year.
As a result of the tighter credit conditions, interest rates
have risen substantially. Call loan rates, for example, increased
throughout 1973, with the rate for money at a day's notice reaching a
10-year high of 12.75 per cent in mid-February, as compared to a rate of
6.75 per cent in June of 1973 and 9.0 per cent last October. Similarly,
the yield on industrial bonds rose from 8.23 per cent in September of
1973 to 9.71 per cent in February 1974.
Following the removal of U.S. capital controls on January 29,
the Canadian Government rescinded the guidelines it had imposed in 1968
to prevent a pass-through of funds from the United States following
Canada's exemption from the U.S. capital controls program.
Ml increased in Canada at an annual rate of 5.4 per cent from
August-October to November-January, a much slower rate than earlier in
1973. Time deposits rose strongly, as savers and investors found the
banks' deposit interest rates relatively attractive.
Interest rates on short-term paper have declined since December,
but the prime lending rates of the chartered banks increased in December
and remained at a relatively high level through February.
