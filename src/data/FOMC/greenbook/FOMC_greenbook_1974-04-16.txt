Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The staff now estimates that real GNP declined at an annual
rate of 4.2 per cent in the first quarter. Nominal GNP is estimated to
have risen some $15 billion, annual rate, about the same as indicated
in the last Greenbook, but prices rose even more rapidly than anticipated--
the private fixed weight index apparently rose at an annual rate of
nearly 11 per cent.
Lifting of the Arab oil embargo on March 18 came too late to
affect first-quarter output and employment; real consumer purchases and
residential construction activity declined appreciably further. In
the fourth quarter of 1973, declines in these two sectors had been offset
by a surge in inventory investment, much of it a buildup of auto stocks.
In the first quarter, inventory investment apparently declined abruptly,
with dealer stocks of autos worked down about as much as they had risen
earlier. Business fixed investment rose further, as did Government
purchases.
Consumer demand appears to have strengthened in March. Retail
sales are estimated on the basis of weekly data to have risen appreciably,
apparently faster than prices. In addition, February retail sales have
been revised up moderately. Unit sales of autos appear to have leveled
off, with total March sales (domestic-type cars and imports) remaining
at the February level of about 9 million units--a somewhat lower rate
than in January. The strength in housing starts in January and February
suggests that activity in this sector may also be bottoming out.

I-2
Surveys pointing to vigor in business demands for fixed capi-
tal are supported by the recent sizable rise in new orders for nondefense
capital goods, in constant dollars as well as in nominal terms. Such
orders in February were up appreciably both from January and from the
fourth-quarter average. Unfilled orders for durable goods also rose
further in February.
Industrial production is tentatively estimated to have declined
somewhat further in March, for the fourth consecutive month. Reductions
were apparently fairly widespread among industries, but output of busi-
ness equipment appears to have changed little.
The unemployment rate edged down in March to 5.1 per cent,
compared with 5.2 per cent in the preceding two months. But State insured
unemployment rose further and nonfarm payroll employment declined after
a sizable rise in February. In manufacturing, employment declined again
in March and the workweek fell back to the January level.
The rise in wage rates was relatively moderate throughout the
first quarter. In March, the adjusted hourly earnings index in the
private nonfarm economy was 6-3/4 per cent above the level of a year
earlier.
Wholesale prices of farm products and foods declined sub-
stantially in March, following three months of increase, but prices of
industrial commodities jumped 2.9 per cent. Increases among industrial
commodities were widespread, with metals contributing most and petroleum
products second in importance. Factors in the exceptionally large March
rise included price increases granted the steel and other industries

I -3
and the decontrol of a number of major industries. In February, the
consumer price index rose 1.3 per cent, following a 1 per cent rise in
January. Foods and fuels again contributed most to the advance, but
increases also occurred among a number of other goods and services.
Outlook. Staff projections have been extended to mid-1975,
and incorporate the following assumptions: (1) With the lifting of the
embargo, oil imports will increase, beginning around midyear, by about
1 million barrels a day from the first-quarter average--to a total of
about 7 million barrels per day. This level is a little below that pre-
vailing last fall, and further below levels then projected for 1974.
The price of imported crude is assumed to remain near $10 a barrel, the
estimated price for March. (2) Growth in M1 is assumed to average about
5-3/4 per cent, annual rate, over the projection period. Since nominal
GNP is expected to grow substantially faster, short-term interest rates
are projected to rise further and remain above current levels. (3) The
staff is now assuming a modification in withholding schedules to effect
a reduction in the amount of overwithholding, at an $8 billion annual
rate, beginning about August 1; a public employment program with out-
lays amounting to $1.65 billion for fiscal 1975 to bring State and local
government employment under the program to 200,000 by the third quarter;
and an extension of unemployment insurance benefits in areas of high un-
employment to 52 weeks. Other Federal expenditure assumptions remain
close to the budget for fiscal 1975. (4) It is assumed that wage and
price controls--except for petroleum--will be ended by April 30, when
the legislation expires.

I- 4
The decline in real GNP is now projected to be largely
completed by the end of the first quarter, with the second quarter
showing only a small negative figure. The expected leveling off of
real GNP stems primarily from a stronger rise projected for consumer
spending, in contrast to the sizable first-quarter drop, and a
slower rate of decline in residential construction activity.
In the second half of 1974, growth in real GNP is projected
to resume at a little over a 3 per cent annual rate. Auto sales are
expected to pick up, and total real consumer purchases are also expected
to expand further, as disposable incomes are augmented by the recently
enacted increase in the minimum wage, by the assumed reduction in over-
withholding, and by Federal pay increases. Residential construction
activity is projected to be rising moderately, but housing starts--
though higher than in the first half--are now expected to level off late
in the year as the availability of mortgage credit becomes increasingly
restricted. Business fixed investment is projected to rise further at
a fairly rapid pace; for the year as a whole, the increase is about in
line with the recent Commerce survey. A moderate slowing in inventory
investment and continued deterioration in net exports are expected to
hold down the rate of expansion.
In the first half of 1975, the rate of growth in real GNP
is projected to fall back to an average of around 2-1/4 per cent,
mainly reflecting increasing weakness in residential construction.
Net exports of goods and services are projected to decline further, as

I -5
growth in exports slows and imports continue rising. Growth in real
consumer spending is projected to hold up reasonably well, even though
increases in disposable incomes are slowed by a reduced volume of tax
refunds, because the saving rate is projected to decline. Business
spending on fixed capital is also expected to continue rising, in part
to meet needs for energy and materials capacity.
Labor force growth is projected to be below normal through-
out the projection period. Even so, with growth in real GNP falling
short of its long-term potential throughout this interval, the un-
employment rate is projected to rise fairly steadily to around 6-1/4
per cent by mid-1975.
The increase in prices is expected to moderate from the
exceptionally rapid first quarter pace, in large part because of a
sharp slowing of increases for foods and petroleum after mid-1974.
Nevertheless, pressures from labor costs are expected to continue
strong, and even in the second quarter of 1975 the rate of increase for
the private fixed weight deflator is expected to average 5 per cent.

Industrial production. The Board's production index has not
yet been calculated. But tentative indications suggest that the index
dropped a little further in March with cutbacks in output of consumer
durable goods, industrial materials for further processing, and con-
struction products. Output of business equipment appears to be about
unchanged.
In March, manhours in manufacturing were down 1 per cent fur-
ther. Output of raw steel was also off. Auto assemblies were at a 6.6
million unit rate, the same as February but output in the auto supplying
industries apparently continued to decline in March.
The index is expected to be calculated in time for inclusion
in the Greenbook Supplement, April 12.
Auto sales. Sales of new domestic-type autos in March were
at a 7.4 million unit rate, the same as a month earlier, but 30 per cent
below March 1973. In the first quarter of 1974, sales were at a 7.5
million unit rate, down 27 per cent from a year earlier.
Sales of large cars picked up in March, apparently in response
to a strong sales incentive program, but sales of both small models and
foreign car sales declined. Sales of imported cars were down 27 per cent
from a year earlier and accounted for 16.1 per cent of total U.S. auto
sales compared with 15.6 per cent a year earlier.

I -12
Retail sales. Strong weekly sales in March and a large upward
revision in February sales, on the basis of the more complete sample
count, suggest that sales in the first quarter may be about 1-1/2 per
cent above the fourth quarter average. Excluding autos and non-consumer
items, first quarter sales might be up about 3.5 per cent, a larger
increase than forecast earlier.
According to present data, sales in February increased 0.2
per cent from January--instead of declining 0.7--with autos, furniture
and appliances, and sales of gasoline stations revised upward. Sales
of general merchandise were weaker than originally reported. The
level of sales in January was unchanged, according to the final sample
count, with offsetting changes primarily among the food, general
merchandise and gasoline station groupings.
Consumer survevs. The most dramatic deterioration in consumer
attitudes in the more than 20 year history of the Michigan surveys
occurred over the last 15 months. In February, the index of consumer
sentiment--a composite of five questions about personal financial
situations, business conditions, and whether it is a good time to buy
household durables--was about 15 points lower than it was at its pre-
vious cyclical low in the second quarter of 1970. Concern about fuel
shortages contributed to the decline, but increased worry about infla-
tion and unemployment were also factors. Moreover, 76 per cent of the
respondents said that the government would probably be unsuccessful in
reducing inflation during the next year or so.

I -13
In a similar vein, the Conference Board survey taken in late
January and early February found substantially more pessimistic evalua-
tions of business and employment conditions. Income expectations were
also unchanged at a low level. There was some slight improvement from
the historic lows of the previous November-December survey in expecta-
tions for business and employment conditions in the next six months.
The Conference Board also reported that buying plans for new autos
were off sharply from the previous survey and from a year earlier,
and home purchase plans continued relatively unfavorable.
It seems unlikely, however, that spending will be curtailed to
the extent implied by these surveys. Because inflation is expected to
continue as bad as (or worse than) now, twice as many people in the
SRC survey say that now is a good time to buy large household goods
than say it is a bad time. In recent months, responses to this ques-
tion have deteriorated much less than the other four questions in the
SRC index of sentiment. The Conference Board also reported relatively
good purchase plans for major appliances.
Construction and real estate. The seasonally adjusted value
of new construction put in place was essentially unchanged in March.
Private residential outlays are estimated to be up 1 per cent, but
were still 18 per cent below the February 1973 peak. 1/ Private non-
residential expenditures, although up less than 1 per cent, reached a
new high in March. Public construction outlays were down 1 per cent.
In constant dollars, total value of new construction put in place rose
somewhat, but remained 12 per cent below the January 1973 peak.

1/ Data for March 1974 are confidential
case should public reference be madeCensus Bureau extrapolations.
to them.
Reflecting a particularly sharp further upthrust in February,
private housing starts in the first two months of 1974 averaged 1.64
million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate)--3 per cent above the
rate in the fourth quarter of last year. But new residential building
permits have remained stable at a reduced annual rate of 1.3 million
units and starts in March may have declined somewhat following their
unusually large rise in February. Completions have continued near a
2 million unit annual rate through early 1974, and with the backlog of
units still under construction down only 2 per cent from a year earlier,

Anticipated plant and equipment spending. The Commerce
Department reports that energy shortages had little net effect on
aggregate plant and equipment expenditures planned for 1974, with
largely offsetting increases and decreases among industries. This
information was obtained from a special supplement to the regular
quarterly survey of business intentions and was taken in late January
and early February. Manufacturers on average stepped up planned out-
lays by $360 million, with the petroleum industry reporting the largest
energy-related increases. This offset most of an anticipated decline
of $420 million outside of manufacturing, with fuel shortages causing
cutbacks in the plans of air transportation, electric utilities, and
the commercial and other sector.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 2.3 per cent in February (p), following a comparable rise
the previous month. The increase in nondefense capital goods orders
in February was particularly strong. Despite two months of over 2
per cent growth, the February level of durable goods orders was only 0.3
per cent above the fourth quarter average. But when motor vehicles
and parts and primary metals are excluded, orders in February were up
5 per cent from the fourth quarter average.
In real terms, durable goods orders in February were almost
3 per cent below the average level in the fourth quarter; however,
orders for nondefense capital goods continued to improve strongly from
their third quarter low point.
Shipments of durable goods increased 0.6 per cent in February
following a 1.5 per cent gain in January. Unfilled orders rose 2.1
per cent in February to a level 35 per cent above a year earlier.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturing and wholesale trade
inventories rose at a $35 billion annual rate in February (p), up from
the sharply upward-revised $31 billion January rate. The average
increase for January and February combined was $33 billion--up from the
$25.6 billion rate in the fourth quarter. However, the more rapid
price increases in the first quarter than in the fourth will presumably
result in a larger inventory valuation adjustment, and thus, a smaller
inventory increase on a GNP basis.

I -19
With the sharp upward revision in January, the two month
average rate of book value increase in manufacturing was almost $24
billion as compared to $19 billion in the fourth quarter. The more
rapid pace appears to be in nondurables--particularly chemicals and
petroleum, where price increases have been sizable. By stage of pro-
cessing, book values of both materials and supplies and of finished
goods stocks were growing more rapidly than in the fourth quarter.
Wholesale trade inventories rose less rapidly in February than in Jan-
uary with much of the slowing occurring in furniture, hardware and farm
products.

Leading indicators now available for March are the average
workweek in manufacturing which declined and common stock prices which
rose.
Labor market. The unemployment rate edged down in March to
5.1 per cent--about the same rate as in the preceding two months--but
payroll employment and the workweek declined and the State insured
unemployment rate continued to rise. Both total employment (household
survey) and the civilian labor force remained about unchanged in March
for the second month in a row; there were employment and labor force
advances among adult women but these were offset by job losses and
reduced labor force participation among adult males. In fact, total
employment has remained relatively stable since late fall following
over two years of rapid growth, though there have been job losses among
adult men--mainly in the industrial sector--offset by employment gains
for adult women.

The payroll data for recent months show continued weakness
in demand for industrial labor. Total nonfarm payroll employment fell
by 125,000 in March, following an increase (upward revised) of 240,000
in February. Nearly all of the March loss occurred in manufacturing.
Total nonfarm employment in March was little changed from November,
although the number of manufacturing jobs was down 315,000. The
heaviest job losses have been in transportation equipment, due in large
part to reduced consumer demand for autos stemming partly from uncer-
tainties over gasoline supplies. Some employment reductions have also
occurred in primary and fabricated metals industries, nonelectrical
machinery, and textiles and apparel.
The manufacturing workweek continued to ease, falling .2 hour
in March with declines widespread. At 40.3 hours, the factory workweek
was the same as in January and half an hour below the high reached in
1973.

Earnings. The average hourly earnings index for private
nonfarm production workers rose quite moderately in the first quarter
following a rapid increase in the last half of 1973; the recent slowing
was probably due in part to irregularities in the timing of wage adjust-
ments. Over the year, the earnings index was up by 6-3/4 per cent, about
the same as the average annual rate of increase from 1968 to 1973. Over-
the-year increases in manufacturing earnings were slightly larger than
the longer run average, but the rise in construction was considerably
smaller than the average increase for the 1968 to 1971 period of
extremely rapid construction wage increases.

Minimum wage. The President recently signed amendments to
the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) which ultimately will raise minimum
wages to $2.30 an hour for all covered workers from the present $1.60
an hour ($1.30 for farm workers) and which will extend coverage to an
additional seven million workers, (an increase in coverage of 14 per cent),

I -24
primarily State and local government workers, household domestics,
farm workers, and small business employees. The new law is estimated
to raise the annual wage bill by $1.9 billion or O.5 per cent beginning
in May 1974 and another $0.8 billion in the first quarter of 1975. In
addition, overtime compensation would be guaranteed for the first time
to more than 8-1/2 million workers primarily employed in agricultural
processing, retail trade, government, hotels, motels, and restaurants.
About 7-1/2 million workers in small service and retail trade
establishments and employees of small farms (less than 500 man days
of work) will remain outside the new minimum wage provisions. In
addition, full time students may be employed on farms and in service,
retail, and educational establishments at 85 per cent of the statutory
minimum so long as it is certified that other employees will not be dis-
placed and they total no more than a limited proportion of the work force.

Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose 1.3 per cent seasonally
adjusted (not at an annual rate), from February to March. Sharp and
widespread increases for industrial commodities were only partly offset
by sizable decreases for prices of farm products and foods, especially
for farm products.

for steel and decontrol of other products in major industries such as
chemicals, paper and paper products, rubber and plastics were associated
with the large March rise.
Although the rate of increase in prices of industrial
commodities in the first quarter was not very different from the fourth,
the fuels and power group accounted for about 60 per cent of the increase
during the fourth quarter of 1973 and for about one-third of the rise
from December 1973 to March 1974, with the rise in prices in this group
dropping from an annual rate of more than 150 per cent to about 60
per cent. Owing in part to an accelerated program of decontrol, however,
prices in most other important groups rose faster in the first quarter,
as shown in the following table.
The index of prices of farm products and foods declined 2.1
per cent, seasonally adjusted, from February to March, owing mainly to
lower prices for farm products such as livestock, grains, cotton, and
wool. Prices of meat and manufactured animal feeds also declined.

Beef prices in February climbed 7.5 per cent (not annual
rate) and most food groups posted very large increases, in particular
fresh vegetables, processed fruits and vegetables, eggs and dairy
products, cereal and bakery products. However, retail prices of
meat have declined since February, as have wholesale prices of meat
and other farm products, notably poultry, eggs and fresh vegetables.
The index for nonfood commodities was boosted by a further
climb in gasoline prices to an average of about 49 cents for regular
and 53 cents for premium, about one-third higher than in February 1973.
Moreover, retail apparel prices, which had appeared to be lagging
prices at wholesale, rose more than one per cent (not annual rate), and
large advances were reported for household durables and a wide range
of other products. Used car prices, however, declined further,

In recent months, wholesale prices of several categories
of consumer finished goods have risen very sharply, notably textile
housefurnishings, appliances and tires. Most of these increases
have not yet been reflected at retail.
In February, service costs rose at over an 8 per cent
annual rate, as in January, with gas and electricity rates climbing
more than 2 per cent (not annual rate), following an even larger
increase in January. The cost of medical care and some other
services rose more rapidly than in other recent months.
Agriculture. Record cattle slaughter in March contributed
to an overall increase in total meat production of about 8 per cent,
seasonally adjusted. These increased marketings helped reduce prices
of farm products, which were down 4 per cent in mid-March from the near
record high of February. Grains also showed major decreases in March
and dropped further by early April.
The price of wheat declined a third from February 15 through
April 5, while corn was down a fifth. March 1 surveys confirmed
farmers' intentions to plant larger crops in 1974 which was a factor
in the declines. Foodgrain acreage (including winter wheat which is
nearing harvest in some areas) may be up 19 per cent and feedgrain plant-
ings are expected to increase 4 per cent. Also a factor in the recent
weakening of feedgrain prices is a downward revision in expected usage,
resulting from fewer cattle on feed.
Placements of cattle onto feedlots during February fell to the
lowest level since the early stages of feedlot development, prior to
1969. On March 1, total cattle on feed were 5 per cent below a year

I -31
earlier but many of these cattle were in the heavier weight groups.
Larger slaughter of nonfed cattle was also a factor in the
expanded beef supply. Preliminary estimates of first quarter cow
slaughter (i.e., slaughter of beef brood cows and milk cows) was
sharply higher and marketings of grass fed steers and heifers appear
to have quadrupled from the 1973 average. These are indications that
livestock farmers see little improvement in their earnings outlook.
Pessimism apparently extends to the hog industry where
there also has been a heavy slaughter of breeding stock during recent
months. The December-February pig crop was down 3 per cent from last
year, indicating a decline in pork supplies for the second half.
March pork production advanced 4 per cent from February, seasonally
adjusted, as slowed marketings during previous months had resulted
in a large number of animals ready for slaughter.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Interest rates have risen considerably further in recent weeks
in adjustment to unusually large business credit demands, a tightening,
of money market conditions, and indications that the economy is stronger
than many market participants had expected. Since the last Committee
meeting, short-term rates have risen from one-half to 1 percentage
point and long-term rates by about one-half to three-fourths of a percent-
age point. At current levels, short-term market rates remain below
their late summer highs, but many long-term rates are above them.
Total short-term business credit demands in March and early
April continued to be very high. Businesses in a wide range of industries
are still borrowing heavily apparently to finance inventory accumulation
in a period of reduced cash flows. While no firm indications are
available, the pace of inventory accumulation appears to reflect not
only unintended inventory build-ups, but also desired stockpiling in
anticipation of further price increases and to obtain scarce raw materials.
Higher prices are also increasing financing needs. In March and early
April, banks provided an exceptionally large volume of short-term
credit, as credit demands shifted from the commercial paper market to
banks with the prime rate low relative to market rates. The prime has
risen one percentage point to a prevailing 9-3/4 per cent since the last
meeting (with a few banks at 10 per cent).
Banks in March also extended over $1 billion of credit to
foreign commercial banks. This increase reflected not only the low U.S.
loan rate relative to the Euro-loan rate, but also Japanese bank borrow-
ing to channel dollars to the Bank of Japan.

II -2
U.S. banks, in order to finance loan expansion, borrowed
heavily in CD and Euro-dollar markets. CD sales were particularly sharp
after mid-March, but some of these sales may have reflected positioning
for expected April CD maturities to finance income tax payments and petrol-
eum outlays to the mid-East. Large Euro-dollar borrowing since early
March, on the other hand, is associated with relatively low rates on very
short-term Euro-dollar deposits which are reported to be under downward
pressure from large Arab deposits in the Euro-dollar call market.
With long-term rates rising sharply, there have been some can-
cellations of scheduled bond issues and some slowing in the growth of
the forward calendar of new issues. Underwriters are becoming much more
cautious in their bidding as syndicate terminations have resulted in
significant losses. The tax-exempt market has also, reportedly, had to
absorb portfolio sales by banks late in March. On the other hand, U.S.
Government security dealers by late March had succeeded in reducing their
previous large positions in coupon issues. Even so, the 2-year note
offered by the Treasury in late March was barely covered.
With market interest rates rising, individuals have recently
become more active purchasers of Treasury bills and coupon issues as
well as corporate and tax-exempt offerings. While no unusual outflows
occurred at the thrift institutions in late March, New York City savings
banks had large outflows in early April. Mortgage lenders are reported
to be becoming more cautious in making new residential mortgage commit-
ments. The average interest rate on S&L new commitments has edged
higher since late March and in the secondary mortgage market yields rose
almost 20 basis points toward the end of March as offerings to FNMA rose
sharply to the highest level in nearly three years.

II -3
Outlook. Short-term rates are likely to show little further
increase over the next few weeks, assuming no change in the Federal
funds rate. Long-term rates could rise somewhat further, although further
cancellations of prospective issues may well temper rate adjustments.
The mortgage market appears to be positioned for a further rise in rates,
in reflection of the increase that has already taken place in long- and
short-term security market rates.
Over the longer run, staff GNP projections imply a further
general increase in market interest rates. As a result--absent changes
in interest rate ceilings--net inflows to thrift institutions would
begin to moderate this quarter and be quite small by late summer. Under
these circumstances, the mortgage market would tighten further. Thrift
institutions are likely to be very cautious in extending further new
mortgage commitments this quarter, and to borrow more heavily from the
FHL Banks, who would in turn step up their own borrowing demands.
Offerings to FNMA would also rise, requiring increased financing by that
agency.
Corporate credit demands, already large, are expected to remain
so as cash flows improve considerably less than financing requirements
for fixed and working capital. Despite recent cancellations, the rising
pace of capital outlays suggests that capital market borrowing will
remain considerable. With such demands bringing upward pressures on
bond yields, diversified lenders are likely to shift increasingly from
mortgages to bonds.
Commercial banks can be expected to reduce their portfolio
liquidity and to rely heavily on CD and Euro-dollar borrowing to finance

II -4
credit demands on them in a period when growth in other time and
savings deposits may be coming under more restraint. The distribution
of bank borrowing between Euro-dollars and CD's will, of course, depend
importantly on relative rates. If mid-East countries continue to invest
in very short-term Euro-dollar deposits, U.S. banks may tend to finance
a growing portion of their credit expansion from this source.

II -5
Monetary aggregates. M1 grew at about a 10 per cent annual
rate in March, only slightly below February's rapid pace. But because
of the contraction of M1 in January, growth for the quarter as a whole
was at a 6.4 per cent annual rate--one percentage point below that in
the fourth quarter. Both M2 and M3 grew less rapidly in March than
M1. The slower M2 growth reflects a slackenening of flows into time
and savings deposits other than large CD's; preliminary data suggest
that the slowing was concentrated in non-CD accounts of $100,000 or
more.
Banks relied heavily on both the CD and Eurodollar markets
in March and early April. Funds were needed to meet unusually large
credit demands, and banks were no doubt positioning themselves to take
care of large CD maturities in April. As usual, corporations are
relying on CD holdings to help finance corporate income tax payments
in mid-April; in addition petroleum companies are expected to draw
down CD's to make April payments to mideast oil countries. On a daily
average basis, outstanding CD's rose $1.1 billion in March, but from
the end of February to the end of March, net issuance of CD's was $2.6
billion, with another $2.7 billion occurring in early April.
In markets for non-deposit instruments, banks acquired $1.5
billion from the end of February to the end of March and $200 million
in early April. About two-thirds of these inflows were Eurodollar
takings from foreign branches. Relatively low short-term Eurodollar
deposit rates--particularly in the call market--made such borrowing
advantageous for U.S. banks. The lower short-term Eurodollar deposit
rates are apparently associated with dollar deposits of oil-exporting
countries.

Bank credit. Business loans expanded sharply in March and
accounted in large part for the continued strong growth of total loans
and investments at all commercial banks (last-Wednesday-of-the-month
series, seasonally adjusted). Analysis of loans by industry indicates
that business borrowing in March was broadly based, with wholesale and
retail traders, metals firms, and public utilities particularly heavy
borrowers. Growth of real estate loans picked up again following a
temporary moderation in February that was largely the result of loan
sales. Consumer loans remained weak, however, and during February and
March expanded at the slowest pace in more than three years.
With total loans growing rapidly, banks did not increase
their holdings of Treasury securities or other securities in March on
a seasonally adjusted basis. The heavy borrowing at banks in the first
quarter has reduced bank liquidity, especially at large New York City
banks whose liquidity ratio had fallen by March to the lowest level
since the summer of 1971.
The acceleration of business loans at banks in March was
encouraged partly by the more favorable rates on bank loans as com-
pared to commercial paper. With commercial paper rates increasing
sharply, this advantage persisted until early April when the prime
rate was raised for the fourth time since mid-March to 9.75 per cent.
(Some banks raised it a fifth time to 10 per cent.) Total commercial
paper outstanding fell in March, as dealer-placed paper contracted.
Nonbank financial institutions borrowed relatively little in the
commercial paper market, keeping most of their new borrowing at

II -8
banks. However, outstanding bank-related commercial paper increased
an estimated $500 million.
While relative rates diverted short-term credit demands to
banks, the sum of short-term nonfinancial business borrowing, as
measured by the total of business loans at banks and dealer-placed
commercial paper, grew somewhat more rapidly than in January-February.
The large volume of total short-term business borrowing in each
month of the first quarter may to some degree be explained by inven-
tory accumulation, part of which is involuntary and part desired be-
cause of expectations of higher prices and shortages of raw materials.
In addition, higher prices paid for inventories during the period
accentuated the need for external financing. A staff estimate puts
the rise in the energy bill of industry due to the increase in
petroleum prices at $2 billion for the first quarter alone, though much
of this increase is likely to have been passed forward to final
purchasers. Finally, some corporate bond issues originally scheduled
for March were cancelled, which may have resulted in a transfer of
credit demands to short-term markets.
In addition to meeting strong business credit demands, banks
extended $1.1 billion of loans to foreign commercial banks during March
when short-term lending rates in New York were lower than Eurodollar
lending rates. There are reports that a sizeable proportion of these
loans were to Japanese commercial banks which were borrowing to supply
the central bank of Japan with dollars. Other categories of foreign
deposits and loans did not show any major changes.

Nonbank financial intermediaries. Savings flows into nonbank
thrift institutions were maintained at about the same pace in March as
in February. A tapering off of deposit inflows was evident toward
the end of March -- with many institutions experiencing net outflows
during the final week. However, moderate net losses have been typical
of other recent reinvestment periods. At the large New York City
mutual savings banks, deposit performance during the March grace days
(the last three business days of the month) was somewhat stronger than
a year earlier; in early April, however, these banks experienced
relatively large outflows. While aggregate savings flow data for early
April are still incomplete, there reportedly has been a substantial
recent increase in individual participation in the securities markets.
This allegation is supported by the increased number of noncompetitive
tenders in recent Treasury bill auctions and by comments from corporate
bond dealers.

During March, S&Ls borrowed a seasonally moderate $100 million
of FHLB advances. All of the net increase in advances occurred in the
last week of March, as S&Ls borrowed to cover actual and anticipated
reinvestment period withdrawals.
The liquidity ratio at S&Ls (cash and other liquid assets
divided by the sum of savings capital and borrowed money) edged up in
February, the latest month for which data are available. On March 20,
the FHLBB announced an increase in the minimum liquidity requirement
from 5-1/2 per cent to 6-1/2 per cent to become effective June 1,
1974--a move that does not appear to affect many S&Ls since most
institutions are currently comfortably above the 6-1/2 per cent mark.

II -14
Long-term securities markets. The bond market decline, which
began in mid-February, accelerated after mid-March. Rising short-
term interest rates, inflation, and increasing signs that the economic
slowdown will be brief all contributed to a rise of 50 to 75 basis
points in long-term yields. On a tax-equivalent basis, the greatest
relative increase has been in the municipal market where rates have
reportedly been under heavy selling pressure from banks and, more
recently, fire and casualty insurance companies concerned about potential
underwriting losses from tornados. Tax exempt yields are currently at
their highest levels since August of 1971, and corporate yields last
reached their current levels in November of 1970. These attractive
rates have reportedly begun to bring individual investors back into
the bond market.
Unsettled conditions in the bond market have been causing
problems for corporate and municipal underwriters, making them more
cautious in their approach to new issues. Several recent corporate
issues sold poorly at higher yields, so underwriters quickly released
price restrictions, rather than increasing their sales effort in hopes
of an eventual sell-out at the original terms. Moreover, the
difference between the winning and second best bid has widened
appreciably since the beginning of the year, reflecting uncertainties
and risk aversion. One major underwriting house has announced that,

II -15
henceforth, it will bid only on issues for companies with whom it has
a long-standing investment banking relationship. In the municipal
market it is reported that market developments have weakened new
issue syndicates and led to a backing away of dealers from secondary
markets.

Led by quotes on equities of financial firms, stock prices
on the NYSE began falling in the middle of March. Market observers
have attributed this decline mainly to rising interest rates.
Previously, share prices had been rallying in anticipation of an end
to the Arab oil boycott and an easing of the energy shortage. Most
recently, issues in the Dow-Jones Industrial average have been trading
around 840, only 40 points above their February lows.

During early 1974 the average monthly volume of total corporate
security offerings has been about $450 million more than a year earlier.
Although public bond offerings are almost twice as high as in early
1973, the volume of new stock issues is still below last year's pace,
and the estimated level of private placements is about unchanged.

II -17
The increase in yields has had a depressing effect on the
volume of new security issues. In March there were over $400 million
of postponements of new debt issues in the corporate market, and about
$200 million in the municipal market. Also, the rate at which new
corporate public debt offerings were being announced decreased
significantly in March relative to January and February. Thus, the
March level of corporate public bond offerings was about $600 million
below the amount projected in the last Greenbook, while State and
local offerings were about $200 million short of their projected
volume. Projections of corporate public bond volume in April and May
show little change from the average pace in the first quarter, although
any improvement in market conditions could prompt a rise as issues
previously postponed re-enter the market.
Consumer credit. Growth in total consumer credit outstanding
during February slowed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.6
billion, the smallest change in outstandings since November 1970 when
sales of new cars were reduced by a major work stoppage in the
industry. The annual rate of expansion in instalment debt--$8.1
billion--was down moderately from January as extensions declined and
repayments edged up to another new high. Noninstalment credit out-
standing, which had declined in January, contracted at a more rapid
annual rate--$3.4 billion--in February.

II -18
The lower rate of instalment credit growth in recent months
primarily reflects the substantial direct effects of the energy
shortage on new and used car sales. Although the ratio of auto
credit extensions to retail sales at automotive outlets has moved
erratically since November, the average for the December-February
period--46.5 per cent--was only a little above the pre-embargo months
of 1973. On the other hand, there has been a marked decrease from
the record third quarter level in the ratio of credit extensions for
the purchase of "other consumer goods" to retail sales at GAF (general
merchandise, apparel, appliance, and furniture) outlets. Part of
this decline reflects the decrease in extensions for recreational
vehicles and mobile homes; these units are included in "other consumer
goods" credit but not in GAF sales.

Finance rates on nonautomotive consumer loan contracts
purchased by finance companies rose further in January. Rates on
mobile home contracts, which are generally below legal ceilings in
States regulating this type of financing, increased 12 basis points
from November and were 73 basis points above the January 1973 level.
Despite the higher rates and the weakness in consumer demand for
mobile homes, price increases of as much as 10 per cent were made by
some smaller producers on April 1. Rate increases from November to
January on furniture and appliance loans and personal loans were
somewhat smaller than for mobile homes, and rates in these categories
are still below year-earlier levels.

Several factors have combined to send market rates sharply
higher. Business loan demands have been exceptionally strong, leading
banks to bid aggressively for lendable funds in the CD market and to
raise the prime rate to as high as 10 per cent. The Federal funds
rate has risen nearly 70 basis points since the March FOMC meeting,
after advancing about 30 basis points in the preceding inter-meeting
period. At the same time, market participants appear to have raised
significantly their forecasts of interest rate levels likely to prevail
over the months ahead. This adjustment in expectations has been
prompted by the strength displayed by the monetary aggregates and by
the further quantum jumps in consumer and wholesale price indexes.
Also, a number of recent developments, most particularly the lifting
of the Arab oil embargo, have encouraged the view that the current
weakness in the economy may not be as severe or long lasting as
previously expected.
One result of the higher level of bill rates is the increase
in noncompetitive tenders in the regular weekly auctions. In the April 8
auction, such tenders amounted to $841 million. This figure is $200
million above levels reached late last summer and represents the
largest volume of tenders since the Treasury raised the minimum
denomination on bills to $10,000 in early 1970.
Treasury Coupon Market. Interest rates on Treasury coupon
issues have also continued to move higher since the March FOMC meeting.
Yields in the short, intermediate, and long-term sectors of the market

II -22
are now about 180,120 and 60 basis points, respectively, above their
mid-February lows, as the table shows. While yields on Treasury
bonds in the 20-year maturity area are now at the highest levels in
the history of the series and were 15 basis points above their peak
levels of last summer, yields on issues in the other maturity areas
remain somewhat below their highs of last summer.

In addition to the factors that have been pushing rates up in
other sectors of the money and bond markets, rates on Treasury coupon
securities were subject to special pressures early in the inter-
meeting period, as dealers continued to pare their holdings of such
issues. Most recently, dealer coupon positions have totaled about
$250 million, in sharp contrast with the $2.3 billion level reached at
the time of the mid-February refunding.
With interest rates on coupon issues generally backing up,
bidding in the Treasury's March 28 auction of 2-year, 8 per cent notes

II -23
proved quite weak. Indeed, the volume of bids submitted barely
covered the $1.5 billion offer, even though non-competitive bidders
acquired more than 30 per cent of the issue. In its first week of
trading, the note declined about one-half point below its average
auction price.
While there were anxious moments, the Treasury managed to
squeeze by the early April low point in its cash balance without
emergency borrowing. Thus, its next financing operation will be the
mid-May refunding. At that time, debt ceiling limitations may force
a paydown of about $1.5 billion of maturing debt. This would force
the Treasury to borrow about $2.5 billion to cover the temporary low
point in its balance before mid-June. However, a substantial $4.5
billion runoff of tax bills is scheduled for the latter part of June,
so that on balance the Treasury is likely to reduce its debt about
$3.5 billion over the remainder of the fiscal year. Federal asset
sales and Federal Agency borrowing are expected to total about $3.0
billion during the rest of the second quarter.
As the following table shows, if our current projections
prove to be reasonably accurate, the combined volume of Treasury-
Federal Agency financing in the current quarter will fall substantially
short of the volume last year. But looking beyond the second quarter,
it seems likely that combined Treasury and Federal Agency financing
over the second half of the year will be on the high side of recent
experience.

Mortgage market. There has been a marked change in the tone
of mortgage markets in recent weeks. Primary market interest rates on
new commitments for home mortgages apparently have bottomed out, while
mortgage yields in the more sensitive secondary market have risen sub-
stantially.
Contract interest rates on new commitments for 80 per cent
conventional home loans at selected S&L's have edged up since mid-March.
On April 5 they averaged 8.44 per cent--close to or above prevailing
usury ceilings in 13 states in the eastern and central portions of the
nation, which together account for about a third of our total population. 1/
However, the competitive attractiveness of home mortgages to diversified
lenders has deteriorated further as yields on new issues of high-grade
utility bonds have risen above those on home mortgages, even before
deduction of mortgage servicing costs. 2/
Amid growing anticipation among mortgage bankers that mort-
gage prices are likely to fall further in the near future, offerings
in the April 8 FNMA auction for forward purchase commitments of FHA/VA
home mortgages were unusually high for the second consecutive auction.
1/ An additional 6 states, accounting for about 6 per cent of the total
population, have usury ceilings of 9 per cent; these ceilings un-
doubtedly discourage some mortgage lending to the most marginal
risks or under the most liberal terms. Some ceilings are currently
under review by State legislatures, and in Maryland a change in the
ceiling from 8 to 10 per cent is imminent. Some states have usury
ceilings that vary depending on the course of market rates (Pennsyl-
vania) or administrative decision (New Jersey and New York).
2/ This is despite the fact that, for comparison with bonds, the
mortgage yields should be converted to the equivalent of a semi-
annual interest investment--which, at current rate levels, means
adding 15 basis points to the gross mortgage yield.

1/ Gross yield spread is average mortgage return before deducting servicing

call protection.
Reflecting the strong demand for commitments, the average yield on
accepted bids rose to 8.95 per cent--52 basis points above the level 4
weeks earlier.
Through at least early March, nonrate terms on commitments
for conventional home mortgage loans in the primary market continued
to loosen. The proportions of S&L's offering higher loan-to-value and
longer term loans increased further, but remained below the share
offering such contracts early last year.

II -27
Although the volume of new mortgage commitments at S&L's
increased in February for the fifth consecutive month, preliminary
data indicate little further change during March, after seasonal
adjustment. Outstanding commitments at S&L's also increased in
February but were 24 per cent below the high reached a year earlier.
However, through April 8, S&L's continued to report funds for home
mortgages in adequate supply relative to demand in all 12 of the
FHLBank Districts. Trade reports suggest that, with expectations of
increases in mortgage rates as well as a slackening of deposit inflows,
thrift institutions have been taking a more cautious approach to
longer-term mortgage commitments.

Federal Finance. The staff's current estimates of unified
budget receipts and outlays for fiscal 1974 are $266.8 billion and
$270.0 billion, respectively. The resulting deficit of $3.2 billion
is somewhat smaller than the Administration's January estimate which
was based on projected receipts of $270.0 billion and outlays of $274.7
billion.
Our new outlay estimate for fiscal 1974 is $1.3 billion below
the figure reported in the March Greenbook. This change is based on
data for recent months which show a continuing shortfall which we do
not expect to be totally recouped by the end of the current fiscal
year. If these shortfalls persist in coming months, they may require
a further downward adjustment in the estimate of fiscal year outlays.
However, it should be noted that in the past some agencies, especially
the Department of Defense, have accelerated their spending schedules
in the closing days of the fiscal year so as not to spend less than
their fiscal year appropriation.
The staff projections for the coming fiscal year incorporate
three new assumptions. First, we are assuming that the Administration's
proposal to modify the personal income tax withholding schedule will re-
duce overwithholding by $8.0 billion (annual rate) beginning in August
and then lower refunds by a corresponding amount the following spring.
Second, on the expenditure side, we are assuming that the Administration's
proposal for an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits will be
passed, and that it will have a growing impact on outlays beginning in
the third quarter of calendar year 1974. Third, we are assuming that

II -29
legislation for public service jobs will add about $1.3 billion to the
$350 million already appropriated for fiscal year 1975. In addition to
these assumptions, a lump-sum payment to federal employees (stemming
from the 1972 Presidential postponement of the pay raise) is expected
to increase outlays in the third quarter by another $0.5 billion. A
substantial offset to these increased expenditures is expected,
however, from expanded offshore-oil sales (recorded as negative outlays
in the unified budget).
On a high employment budget basis, we are currently projecting
a shift from a $1.3 billion (annual rate) surplus in the first half of
calendar year 1974 to a $4.3 billion (annual rate) deficit in the second
half, largely reflecting the assumed $8 billion (annual rate) change in
withholding beginning in August. In the first half of calendar 1975,
however, we are forecasting a $9.1 billion shift toward surplus. This
largely reflects reduced refund payments resulting from the assumed
reduction in overwithholding.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. In the first quarter of 1974, the balance
of payments surplus on the official settlements basis shrank to about
$1 billion (seasonally adjusted), compared with $2-3/4 billion in the
preceding quarter. A substantial surplus in January, when the dollar
was still appreciating against foreign currencies, was followed by growing
deficits in February and March as the dollar depreciated.
Available data provide only a partial explanation of the
weakening of the dollar in February and March. The trade surplus
diminished further in February as the value of imports, particularly
of fuels, rose even more rapidly than the value of exports. Gross bank-
reported flows of private capital were large in February, with a small
net outflow for the month, in contrast to earlier net inflows. There
may well have been substantial net outflows of corporate funds during
the first quarter, although data on these are not yet available.
The balance on goods and services is now projected to
deteriorate fairly steadily from a record surplus of $16 billion
(seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the final quarter of 1973 to a
deficit of around $6 billion in the second quarter of 1975. Virtually
all of the projected deterioration is expected to occur in the
merchandise trade balance, with the value of fuel imports rising
sharply, especially during the first half of 1974, and the value of

III -2
agricultural exports falling off after mid-1974 as agricultural
commodity prices decline in response to enhanced supplies abroad. By
contrast, the surplus on services and military transactions is expected
to hold up well, exceeding an annual rate of $7 billion throughout the
projection period, and could even increase if the foreign earnings of
major U.S. oil companies exceed our somewhat conservative guess. The
projection assumes only moderate growth in output in major industrial
countries abroad, with prices rising about as fast as in the United States.
It also assumes that petroleum prices will remain at current levels; if
they were to decline by 10 percent, the import bill would be about
$3 billion lower (annual rate) in early 1975.
How inflows and outflows of capital will balance out over the
period ahead remains highly uncertain. Interest rates have declined
slightly in recent weeks in Britain and Germany, but monetary policies
remain generally restrictive abroad, reflecting deep concern over the
recent rapid rates of inflation. Many European countries and Japan,
faced with large increases in payments for petroleum, have arranged
further borrowings in the Euro-dollar market. Very large payments to
oil-producing countries are scheduled for this month, and a large
proportion of these funds will probably be placed by the recipiants
in Euro-dollars.

Foreign exchange markets. Exchange market activity in recent
weeks has been dominated by changing expectations concerning a revaluation
or appreciation of the German mark. In the period from the week ended
March 13 to the week ended April 5 the mark appreciated by 4-3/4 per cent
against the dollar, while the dollar, on a weighted average basis depre-
ciated by 2-3/4 per cent. In the most recent week the dollar has rebounded
as speculation on an imminent revaluation of the mark abated and movements
in interest differentials, in favor of dollar assets, moved to the fore.
Intervention by major central banks in the past four weeks amounted
to net sales of $700 million. In addition there was roughly $700 million
equivalent of intervention within the European snake, with central banks
selling marks against all other snake currencies. As far as dollar inter-
vention is concerned, the Bank of Italy sold on the order of $1 billion,
while the Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve purchased $325 million
against marks.
As indicated above, the mark was the focus of attention for
most of the period and was the currency to appreciate most against the
dollar. The speculation flared up on March 20 with the publication of a
report by the Hamburg Economic Research Institute which stated that the
mark might have to be revalued. It intensified following the release of
U.S. trade figures for February and the delay in the release of German
trade figures which were rumored to show a huge surplus. In addition,
many market participants anticipated that the spring report of five German
research institutes, due to be released on April 8 would recommend a mark
revaluation. By the time that German trade figures were released, the

III -4
market had already discounted the news, and in the report of the five
institutes only a minority recommended a mark revaluation or independent
float. That seemed to take the steam out of the mark's upward movement
And when the Bundesbank did not move to mop up domestic currency liquidity
created by exchange market conditions, and in fact reduced the rate at
which it discounts Treasury bills, while U.S. interest rates continued
to climb, the mark began to ease against the dollar.
In addition to Germany, policy actions were taken in Switzerland,
the U.K. and France to ease domestic liquidity, and these moves probably
contributed to the dollar's broad advance in recent days.
Italy continued to support the lira with massive intervention
in March and early April. By April 8 it had sold a total of around $550
million for the month, a somewhat greater rate than the monthly average
of $1 billion in the first quarter. Italy's March dollar sales were
financed by the proceeds of its $1.8 billion drawing on the EC fund at
mid-March. It is currently financing intervention from the proceeds of
a $1.2 billion Euro-dollar borrowing by Mediobanca, an Italian state credit
agency.
Gold prices have moved in a range of $164 to $180 over the past
four weeks, and were most recently quoted near the upper end of that range.
Euro-dollar market. Interest rates on Euro-dollar deposits have
risen substantially further in the past four weeks. Bid rates on April 10
for 1- and 3-month deposits were 10-3/8 and 10-9/16 per cent, respectively,

about 1-3/4 per cent above average levels in the week of March 13. Rising
interest rates in the United States were the main reason for the increase
in Euro-dollar rates, and there has been little net change in the differ-
entials vis-a-vis CD rates in the United States. The 3-month Euro-dollar
deposit rate exceeded the 60-89 day CD rate by an average of 63 basis points
in the week of April 10. This differential was larger in the last week of
March when seasonal factors and speculation on a revaluation of the German
mark put added upward pressure on Euro-dollar rates.
The overnight Euro-dollar rate rose little until the past few
days, perhaps in reflection of a larger increment to supply than for the
longer maturities. As a result, the relative costs to U.S. banks of
overnight Euro-dollars and Federal funds underwent a substantial shift;
overnight Euro-dollars adjusted for reserve requirements averaged more
than one-half per cent less than Federal funds in the week of April 3,
compared with a 25-point differential of opposite sign in the week
of March 13. The shift in relative costs accompanied a substantial
increase in U.S. banks' Euro-dollar borrowings, as reported elsewhere.
In the most recent week, a rise in the overnight Euro-dollar rate and a
slight easing in the Federal funds rate again made Euro-dollars more
costly than Federal funds.

III -7
The cost of short-term Euro-dollar loans to nonbank borrowers
advanced much more sharply during March than bank loan costs in the
United States. The excess of the Euro-dollar loan rate for prime borrowers
over the U.S. prime rate widened by about 80 basis points from March 1
to March 29, to show a difference of about 1-1/4 per cent on the latter
date, and as noted on p. 11 U.S. banks' loans to foreign commercial banks
rose sharply in consequence. But this cost differential contracted to
only about 3/4 per cent by April 5 as the U.S. prime rate continued to
climb.
In March, agreements were signed for $6.7 billion of publicized
medium-term Euro-currency loans according to provisional IBRD estimates,
bringing the total for the first quarter to $13.6 billion. In addition
to those reported in last month's Greenbook, major borrowings announced
in March included the British Treasury ($2.5 billion), the Government
of Mexico ($500 million), the Central Bank of the Philippines ($500
million), the Kingdom of Denmark ($300 million), the Spanish National
Institute of Industry ($300 million), and the Republic of Austria ($115
million).

III -8
U.S. balance of payments. The U.S. balance of payments
weakened noticeably in February and March. Between the end of January
and the end of March the dollar depreciated by nearly 8 percent, on
average, against the major foreign currencies, and the balance on the
official settlements basis for the same period was a deficit of perhaps
$1-1/2 billion (not seasonally adjusted, not at an annual rate). For
the first quarter the official settlements balance was probably a
surplus of around $1 billion (seasonally adjusted), compared to a
surplus in the fourth quarter of about $2-3/4 billion.
Although data on specific balance of payments transactions
for February-March are very limited, it appears that the weakening
resulted from an adverse shift in private capital flows as well as a
decline in the trade surplus.
In February there was an outflow of bank-reported private
capital as described below, compared to a small inflow in January and
a substantial inflow in the fourth quarter. Data on flows of corporate
funds during the first quarter are not yet available. There could well
have been substantial direct investment outflows, as in the fourth
quarter, and some repayment of short-term debt following the lifting of
controls.
In February there was a small net inflow on private securities
transactions which was about the same as in January. Foreign net
purchases of U.S. stocks at $156 million in February were little changed

III- 9
but foreigners sold U.S. bonds net in February, following large net
purchases in the two preceding months. U.S. net purchases of foreign
bonds were very small in February, compared to large net purchases in
January. However, Canadian provincial flotations in March were
reported to have been substantial. So far as is known there has been
only one new security issue in the United States by any foreign borrower
subject to the Interest Equalization Tax for which the rate is now
zero.
The trade surplus in February fell to $130 million (seasonally
adjusted, not at an annual rate) from close to $400 million in January
as imports rose very sharply, exceeding the more moderate rise in
exports. About 50 percent of the increase in imports in February
resulted from the increase in oil prices announced in previous months,
as the unit value of imported oil rose to an average of $9.25 per
barrel, compared to $7.10 in January. A further rise in this unit value
probably occurred in March.
For the fourth quarter of 1973 the basic balance (on current
account and long-term capital) was a surplus of $0.2 billion (seasonally
adjusted, not at an annual rate), down sharply from the extraordinary
$2.5 billion surplus in the third quarter. The decline was accounted
for mainly by an adverse shift in net private long-term capital flows,
which more than offset an increase in the surplus on goods and services.

III -10
U.S. bank-reported capital flows. In February and March, bank-
reported capital flows in the U.S. balance of payments were substantial
in both directions. The net balance (excluding transactions with foreign
official institutions) shifted from a $100 million net inflow in January
to a $350 million net outflow in February. The further large flows in
both directions shown by weekly data in March for the most part reflect
arbitraging with the Euro-dollar market. These data omit many flows,
and so cannot be relied upon as an advance indicator of the net balance.
In February, bank-reported claims on foreigners rose $2.1 billion
(none of which was recorded by the weekly figures). The termination of
the VFCR was presumably the main factor behind the rise, which included
increases of $600 million in loans to foreign commercial banks (mostly
in Europe and Latin America), $450 million in acceptances for foreign
account (concentrated in Asi[a]), and $900 million in other claims,
principally on Nassau branches, Canada, and Japan. Liabilities to
private foreigners were up $1.7 billion in February, principally because
of an increase of $500 million in demand deposits of foreign commercial
banks and an $300 million rise in liabilities to the Bahamas and
Cayman Islands. Plausible explanations for these increases in lia-
bilities are lacking.
In March, for which data are incomplete, claims on foreigners
reported weekly by large commercial banks in the United States rose
$1.5 billion in the four weeks to March 27; their loans to foreign

III -11
commercial banks increased $1.1 million and their loans to other
foreigners nearly $400 million. The increase in loans to foreign
commercial banks largely concerned Japanese banks, and was touched off
when the cost of such loans (reportedly 1/2 to 1 percent above the prime
rate, with no additional balances required) fell below rates on short-
term Euro-dollar loans. On the liabilities side, U.S. banks' gross
liabilities to foreign branches increased $1.1 billion in the five weeks
to April 3 (balance-of-payments basis) and a rise of close to $600 million
occurred in the foreign liabilities of New York agencies and branches of
foreign banks in the same period. The decline in the overnight Euro-
dollar rate relative to the Federal funds rate would appear to have been
the main cause of these inflows.
U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. merchandise trade surplus for
February fell to $1.6 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate, balance
of payments basis), compared with $4.7 billion (revised) in January and
$5.4 billion in fourth quarter 1973. The major development underlying
this deterioration was the rapid increase in the cost of fuel imports,
which rose from an annual rate of $11.5 billion in fourth quarter 1973
to a $20.0 billion rate in February. Net of fuel imports, the rate of
surplus for January and February was $3.9 billion higher than the fourth
quarter rate.
The (average monthly) volume of agricultural exports was only
slightly higher in January-February than in fourth quarter 1973. However,

III -12
these exports increased 8 percent in value during this period as prices
continued to rise rapidly.
Exports of nonagricultural commodities were 10 percent higher
in (average monthly) value during the first two months of this year than
during fourth quarter 1973. Roughly two-fifths of this increase was in
volume, and three-fifths in unit value. Exports of nonagricultural
industrial supplies and materials rose by nearly 3 percent in volume
and 12 percent in unit value during this period as price increases were
large and widespread. Exports of capital goods grew by 2 percent in
volume and increased 4 percent in unit value.
With the gradual relaxation of domestic price controls, which
are expected to be removed almost completely by April 30, it has been
suggested that the growth of export volumes will decline if U.S. suppliers
find their domestic customers willing to pay higher prices. Nevertheless,
for machinery, primary metals, and other durables (excluding automotive
products and aircraft), both the backlog of unfilled export orders and
the rate of new export orders reached new highs (in value terms) during
January and February.
Imports of fuels and lubricants continued to increase sharply
in value during February, as the unit value of petroleum rose to $9.26
per barrel from $7.11 in January. In part, this price rise reflected
the continuing effects of the price increases instituted by the oil-
producing countries last December. In addition, the higher unit value

III -13
reflected the increase in the Canadian export tax from $2.20 to $6.40
per barrel, effective February 1; this tax approximated the difference
between the Canadian domestic price and the price received at that time
by other suppliers of the United States and Eastern Canada. A further
rise in the U.S. import price probably occurred in March. Beginning in
April, the Canadian export tax has been lowered to around $4 per barrel,
but the Canadian domestic price has been fixed at a level which precludes
any significant effect on U.S. import prices. With the suspension of the
oil embargo, imports of petroleum may rise another million barrels per day
by the middle of the year; and unless oil prices decline, the trade
balance may well shift into deficit during the second quarter.

The (average monthly) value of non-fuel imports in January-
February was 6 percent higher than in the fourth quarter. The volume
of these imports grew by 5 percent and the unit value increased by less
than 1 percent during this period, but major components of these imports
showed substantially different changes. Among the major non-fuel import
categories, only automotive products has shown striking volume growth
during recent months.
For automotive products, the (average monthly) value of imports
from Europe and Japan was 12 percent higher,during January-February
than during fourth quarter 1973, and import volume increased proportionately
more. However, the January-February import volume exceeded new foreign
car sales by nearly 40 percent, reflecting a rebuilding of inventories,
which had declined steadily from mid-1972 through December 1973.

III -15
Price developments in foreign industrial countries. During
1973 the problem of high inflation rates began to dominate economic
policy considerations in almost all industrial countries. Three major
factors contributed to these concerns. First, a rapid runup of prices
for agricultural goods began early in the year, caused by shortfalls
in grain and oilseed production. Second, and more important, there was
an increasingly sharp worldwide competition for supplies of raw and
intermediate materials, as aggregate demand rose simultaneously in a
number of the major consuming countries. Third, the steep price rises
for petroleum and petroleum products in the aftermath of the Mid-East
oil embargo announced on October 17.
Although the pace of inflation accelerated somewhat in the
late 1960's, the sort of rates recorded in 1973 were unprecedented on
a world scale in peace time (see Table 1). Much of this new impetus
is directly related to the price of commodities. According to the
Economist's index, overall spot commodity prices in dollar terms were
70 per cent higher at the end of June 1973, than a year earlier. At
the end of December they were 64 per cent higher than at the beginning
of the year, and since then they have risen further at an annual rate
of almost 50 per cent. In the first half of 1973 price rises for food
and other agricultural products accounted for a large part of the change.
Since then the main upward impetus has come from the rapid surge of
petroleum and metals prices. In countries such as the United Kingdom,

Italy and Japan, depreciation of effective exchange rates during 1973
magnified the effect of the rise of world prices on the domestic price
level, while for countries whose exchange rates appreciated, such as
Germany, these effects were moderated.
The large increases in raw food prices seem to have worked
through to the retail stage to a considerable extent. For the seven
countries shown in Table 2 combined, the rise in food prices in 1973
accounted for more than two-fifths of the total price increase, con-
siderably more than in the 1963-72 period. The major role played by
food in the acceleration of consumer prices was widespread, except for
Germany, Japan and the Netherlands, where non-food price rises con-
tributed even more. But in all countries the contribution of services
to the overall price rise in 1973 was well below earlier averages.
As shown in Table 1, price increases at the wholesale level
have historically tended to be more moderate than those at the consumer
price level. By the last half of 1973, however, and even before the
oil crisis, this pattern had been reversed. A conclusion which might
be drawn from this is that a good part of the recent increases in non-
food commodity prices has not yet been passed through to the retail
level.
Such further increases in the cost-of-living are widely
anticipated and may have an impact on forthcoming wage negotiations.
The latter are now at the center of policy concern, because in 1973

wage bargains were fairly moderate in the U.S. as well as in other
industrial areas, so that there was a consequent decline in real wages
for the year as a whole. Wage demands this year are likely to attempt
to make up for real income losses last year and to avoid a recurrence
of such a shift this year.
In the United Kingdom problems of inflation are coupled with
steadily worsening balance of payments prospects. In an attempt to protect
the purchasing power of lower income groups without increasing wage costs,
the Labour Government has announced extensive subsidies on various food
items, designed to cut food prices by 6 per cent and to reduce the overall
retail price index by about 1-1/2 per cent. In addition, rents on public
and private housing had already been frozen for the remainder of 1974.
On the other hand, prices for output of nationalized industries
are to be raised, as are some excise taxes. The coverage of the value-
added tax was also extended. The total impact of all measures presented
in the recent budget announcement will be to raise the retail price index,
but to lower those components that loom large in the budgets of wage-
earners and old-age pensioners.
Nevertheless, the pressure for more generous labor settlements
is high and rising, especially in the wake of the settlement of the
miners' strike, and even though statutory wage controls have not yet
been lifted. At the same time, with output growth slowing,productivity

III -21
increases have fallen well below the exceptionally high levels of 1972
and early 1973, and may well be relatively small. In addition to possibly
high new wage contracts, further wage increases are already in the
pipeline: labor agreements concluded under the wage guidelines of 1973
have an automatic escalator clause which is triggered when the retail
price index rises 7 per cent above the level of October 1973. By
February 1974, the index was already 5.2 per cent above that level, so
that the escalator provision may be activated quite shortly. About
3-1/2 million workers -or one seventh of the labor force -are covered
by such agreements so far. Thus, the prospect that a cost-push inflation
can be avoided is not very likely.
The Italian situation in 1973 was marked by extremely rapid
pass-throughs of recent increases in commodity and energy prices. In
addition, two factors contributed noticeably to the acceleration of
inflation rates. First, the price freeze imposed in the summer of 1973
has gradually been relaxed, leading to a bunching of price increases.
Second, the sharp depreciation of the lira in the early part of the
year increased the costs of imported goods, and was particularly
important in the case of raw and intermediatematerials, inventories
of which were very low. Both the price freeze, which was applied largely
at the retail level, and the depreciation tended to reinforce the
divergence of the WPI and CPI. Between January and October (the latest
month for which sectoral details are available) the prices of both

III -22
industrial materials and investment goods rose by more than 20 per cent,
while those for consumer goods were up nearly 15 per cent. It should
also be noted that the value-added tax introduced in January is estimated
to have added about 2 points to the Italian CPI in 1973.
Even with the high inflation rates, real wages have increased
in 1973 faster than in 1972. Hourly wage rates in manufacturing were
up nearly 28 per cent from December 1972, to December 1973, and expecta-
tions for 1974 are that wage demands cannot easily be kept even to the
1973 level. The authorities are not well placed to resist wage demands
strongly because of the danger of renewed widespread workstoppages,
which plagued the Italian economy intermittently since 1969. At the
same time the government is committed to restrain demand forces in the
economy. The conditions attached to the "letter-of-intent" associated
with an IMF statutory credit, point to limiting the rate of domestic
credit growth through March 1975, as a main instrument for achieving
this.
Of the major industrial countries Japan is clearly the hardest
hit by the current inflationary climate. Japanese prices began a steep
upward climb in early 1973, pushed mainly by soaring world prices for
raw materials, on which the economy is heavily dependent. Throughout
the year the acceleration of wholesale prices consistently outstripped
increases in consumer prices (particularly unusual for Japan). While in

III -23
the third quarter of 1973 wholesale prices were 17.3 per cent above
year-earlier levels, by February 1974, they had skyrocketed to 37
per cent above year-earlier levels. Price rises for durable and
capital goods contributed least to this price surge.
The impact of the petroleum situation also has been
particularly severe on Japan. Overall, the economy is 75 per cent
dependent on oil for its total energy requirements, and almost 100
per cent dependent on imports for its oil requirements. In addition,
in Japan as in Italy, major growth sectors of the economy involve
petroleum-related products: chemicals, fertilizers, plastics and
other synthetic materials.
On March 16, in an attempt to slow the rapid inflationary
surge, the Japanese government froze prices of 53 major industrial
commodities and 148 retail items. There are signs, however, that at
least the rate of increase in wholesale prices was already slowing
before the freeze was imposed. In December, the WPI climbed 7.1 per
cent over the previous month, but in January and February the monthly
rise was 5.5 and 3.9 per cent, respectively.
In addition to the recent price freeze, the Japanese
authorities have tightened monetary conditions in successive steps
and cut back government expenditures. For fiscal 1974 (which began
on April 1) the government forecasts a 15 per cent increase in wholesale

III -24
and a 10 per cent rise in consumer prices. Forecasts by the Japan
Economic Research Center are, however, substantially higher (26 per
cent for the WPI and 22 per cent for the CPI).
In France price reactions to the increase in materials
prices in 1973, and especially to the petroleum price increases late
in the year,were rapid because such cost rises could be passed on
under the price-contracts concluded between the government and industry.
By February 1974, French wholesale prices had risen by 29.2 per cent,
and consumer prices by over 11 per cent in a twelve-month period.
Despite high levels of structural unemployment, the labor market for
skilled workers tightened considerably during the year, and 1973 wage
rate gains of 15.1 per cent exceeded even those of 1968.
French government policy during much of 1973 was aimed at
restraining aggregate demand by slowing the growth of credit in the
economy. In March of this year, an anti-inflation package was announced
which is geared to the government's present belief that the worst of
the inflationary tide will have passed by mid-year. Tax payments were
accelerated, and value-added tax rates are to be lowered later in the
year, when aggregate demand is expected to fall off. The budget deficit
is also to be cut drastically. On the other hand, limits on growth of
bank credits have been eased somewhat.

The possible impact of inflationary wage agreements is a
real concern in 1974. To discourage overly-large settelements, French
firms have been granted permission to pass on cost increases stemming
from higher materials and energy prices, but not "internal" costs such
as higher wage settlements. In certain cases involving mostly
agricultural products, price or profit margin freezes are in effect.
Rents are also frozen until July 1974, and an attempt has been made
to stabilize public utility charges. Political uncertainties in
France, which existed before and continue after the death of President
Pompidou, however, may lessen the effectiveness of government efforts
to hold down 1974 wage increases.
In Germany inflation rates have been consistently lower than
in other industrial countries, but as elsewhere have accelerated in
recent months, at least at the wholesale price level. The repeated
revaluations of the Deutsche mark (3 per cent against the parities of
Germany's joint float partners in March 1973, and 5.5 per cent in June
1973) were a factor which, until recently, helped moderate German price
increases, but in late 1973 the price effect of the world commodity boom
and the oil crisis was somewhat heightened due to the relative decline
of the DM from revaluation levels set in the middle of the year.
The German government continues to follow fairly tight monetary
and fiscal policies to manage demand levels and hold further price

III -26
increases in check. Official policy for 1974 is oriented toward
stability in the standard of living and restraint in consumption
demand. Labor and management have both been warned not to try to
increase their relative shares of output this year. This approach
may be somewhat more successful in Germany than elsewhere, because
consumer prices, though rising fast, did not outstrip wage increases
in 1973. Still, with the considerable acceleration in wholesale
prices in recent months, the announced target of a 10 per cent or
less increase in the CPI for 1974 may be too optimistic. Germany's
very strong external position has led to recommendations that the DM
should again be revalued. A revaluation, should it occur, would
enhance the chances for keeping inflation in rein.
The problem of inflation in the Netherlands is somewhat
attenuated by the large energy reserves of that country and reliance
on domestic gas resources is growing rapidly. The revaluation of
the guilder on September 17, 1973, has also served to cushion the
impact of the inflation in materials prices in the latter part of the
year.
The course of recent price developments in the Netherlands,
in fact, bears strong resemblance to the experience in Germany, to
which the Dutch economy is closely tied. Wholesale prices in February

III -27
were up 14 per cent, and consumer prices 0.4 per cent above year-
earlier levels, but these figures are still at the lower end of the
European scale. Prior to the oil crisis, with the introduction of
the 1974/75 Budget, the government had hoped to cut the increase in
the CPI to the 6-7 per cent range for 1974, but this now seems an
unrealistic goal. Following a breakdown in labor-management talks,
on March 20 the Dutch government imposed what appears to be a rather
moderate settlement. Dutch real wages are broadly protected by
cost-of-living escalators, so that further price rises are quickly
translated into increased wages.
Unlike the other industrial countries, Canada as a whole is
self-sufficient in petroleum. However, Western Canada is a net
exporter, while Eastern Canada is a net importer of crude petroleum.
On March 27, Premier Trudeau reached an agreement with the provincial
premiers to raise the price of Western Canadian crude petroleum by
$2.50 per barrel to a level of $6.50 per barrel for the next 12-15
months. The federal government will receive the revenue from the
export tax (which is set at about four dollars per barrel for April)
and use it to subsidize the price of imported oil in the East, so that
there will be a uniform national price for petroleum within Canada.
This increase will put some further upward pressure on the Canadian
price level, but clearly nowhere near as much as in some other countries.

III -28
In January 1974, overall wholesale prices were 26.6 per cent
above their year-earlier level, but rates of increase had stabilized
in the second half of 1973. Consumer prices in 1974 are expected to
increase by approximately 7-1/2 per cent over 1973, about the same
rate as for 1973 over 1972. However, the rate of increase is expected
to decelerate in the second half of 1974.
In all of the countries reviewed above, inflationary prospects
for 1974 depend critically on two factors which have yet to take shape
with clarity. First, the question whether commodity prices are likely
to come down or at least level off. This is an assumption underlying
most forecasts, and depends greatly on the course of industrial activity
in the major countries in the next months.
The second question centers upon the degree of success with
which each country can keep wage increases within anti-inflationary
guidelines. Whatever else occurs, it now appears that 1974 will be
marked by strong labor sentiment in favor of catch up settlements to
compensate for the rapid increases in the cost-of-living generated
during the past year.
