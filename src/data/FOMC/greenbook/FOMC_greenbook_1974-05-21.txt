Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent data suggest a leveling out in overall economic
activity in the second quarter and a continuation of rapid price
increases. The first quarter turned out weaker than the staff had
expected--with real GNP down at an annual rate of 5.8 per cent and prices
as measured by the private fixed-weight index up at a rate of 12.5 per
cent, according to the initial Commerce estimates.
An improvement recently in industrial output payroll employ-
ment, and retail trade reflects to a large extent some recovery of
domestic auto production and sales. Industrial production is now esti-
mated to have risen 0.4 per cent in April, and figures for February and
March were revised up. The April index level is about the same as the
first quarter average. In addition to an appreciable increase in auto
assemblies, increases occurred in output of steel and other durable
auto supply industries. Production of business equipment was revised
up for March and increased moderately further in April to a new high.
Most other sectors of the index changed little.
The unemployment rate edged down to 5.0 per cent in April,
the second straight month of slight decline. The civilian labor force
was also off a little, and has shown little change in the last three
months. Nonfarm payroll employment increased moderately in April, with
manufacturing employment showing its first advance since last November.
The sharp decline in the factory workweek in April appears to be
attributable mainly to the occurrence of Good Friday within the reporting
week.

I-2
Retail sales rose moderately in April, with the automotive
group accounting for much of the advance. Unit sales of domestic-type
autos increased 6 per cent but sales of domestic-type small cars showed
no increase and there was a further decline in sales of imported cars.
The slight increase in retail sales outside the automotive area was
apparently less than the rise in prices.
Although the sharp decline in activity in the first quarter
was accompanied by some easing in rates of capacity utilization in manu-
facturing, business demands for plant and equipment remain strong,
according to the latest McGraw-Hill survey. However, new orders for
nondefense capital goods in constant prices have changed little on
balance in recent months. Purchasing agents continue to report
numerous basic commodities in short supply, but the list is not quite
as extensive as a few months ago.
The increase in wage rates has accelerated somewhat in recent
months, rather than slowing as initial reports had indicated. The
adjusted hourly earnings index for private nonfarm workers was revised
up for February and March and a sizable further increase was reported
for April, when the index was 7.1 per cent above a year earlier. Unit
labor costs in the private nonfarm economy increased by an exceptionally
large amount in the first quarter.
Inflationary pressures continue to be acute, even though
wholesale prices of farm products and processed foods declined sub-
stantially in April, for the second consecutive month. The drop of 3.0
per cent in this category did not, however, fully offset the 2.3

I-3
per cent rise in industrial commodities, and the total index increased
0.7 per cent. Increases in April were again widespread among commodity
groups, with metals, paper, and chemicals accounting for more than half
of the advance. With price controls ended on April 30, except for
petroleum and products, a further sizable increase seems in prospect
for the May index. In March, the consumer price index had risen 1.1
per cent, and increases were widespread among commodities and services.
Outlook. Staff projections through mid-1975 incorporate the
following policy assumptions: (1) Growth in M1 is assumed to average
an annual rate of 5-1/2 per cent for the second and third quarters of
this year, and an annual rate of 5-3/4 per cent over the remainder of
the projection period. Nominal GNP is expected to grow faster than this,
and short-term interest rates are projected to rise somewhat further.
(2) The staff still assumes an adjustment in withholding schedules to
effect an $8 billion annual rate reduction in the amount of over-
withholding, beginning about August 1. (3) A public employment program
is assumed with outlays amounting to $1.6 billion for fiscal 1975,
bringing the number of State and local government employees under the
program to 200,000 by the second quarter of calendar year 1975. Other
Federal expenditure assumptions remain close to the budget for fiscal
1975. (4) Wage and price controls have now ended except for petroleum,
and it is assumed there will be no reimposition of controls during the
projection period.

I -4
Real GNP in the second quarter is still projected to stabilize,
following the sharp first quarter decline, as real consumer spending
firms following earlier sharp reductions, business fixed investment
strengthens, and the drop in residential construction slows considerably.
Such a leveling off would be consistent with further monthly increases
of industrial production.
Growth in real GNP in the second half of 1974 is now pro-
jected at an annual rate of 2-3/4 per cent, somewhat slower than last
time. Projected new car sales have been revised down; 1975 models are
not expected to be as favorably received as anticipated earlier,
partly in view of the large auto price increases occurring and in
prospect. Housing starts are still expected to rise and then level
off in the second half of the year. The stimulative effect of the
Administration's newly announced mortgage financing program is expected
to be about offset by smaller inflows to thrift institutions than
previously anticipated.
In the first half of 1975, the rate of real growth in GNP
is projected to slow to an annual rate of 2-1/4 per cent--about the
same as expected earlier--mainly reflecting a drop in residential con-
struction. Housing starts and activity should hold up a little better
than earlier expected because of the new Administration program, but
real consumer expenditures are expected to be a bit weaker.
An important difference between the current projection and
that of four weeks ago is the faster rate of price rise now expected,
particularly over the balance of this year. The upward revision reflects

I-5
much larger than expected recent increases in wholesale prices of
industrial products and consumer prices of goods and services, suggest-
ing that underlying inflationary pressures are stronger than we had
anticipated. We continue to expect strong pressures from unit labor
costs as workers strive to recoup--or improve--real earnings that
have already been significantly eroded by inflation. However, the
staff is still projecting a continued slowing of the rate of price
increase over the entire projection period, largely because of the
likelihood of a substantial moderation in the rise of prices of foods
and petroleum products.
The unemployment rate is projected to rise to just over 6
per cent in the spring of 1975. This is a little less than projected
last time, because the rate most recently has been held down by
failure of the civilian labor force to show any growth.

Industrial production. After falling for four consecutive
months, industrial production rose 0.4 per cent in April, following
upward revisions in February and March of 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points,
respectively. The April rise in production reflected increased output
of autos, business equipment, and durable goods materials. Most other
sectors of the index showed little change.
Auto assemblies rose 13.5 per cent in April and were at an
annual rate of 7.5 million units compared with 6.6 million units in
March. May and June production schedules indicate some further
increases. Output of other durable consumer goods and nondurable
consumer goods changed little at advanced levels. Production of business
equipment which was revised up for March, increased further in April
as did output of steel and other durable goods materials, mainly in
the automotive supplying industries. Production of nondurable goods
materials and construction products was unchanged. Pressures on
capacity in most materials industries continued strong.

Retail sales. Although the current value of sales in April
rose 1.4 per cent from March, this largely reflected some recovery in
expenditures for the automotive group. Excluding autos and non-
consumption items, sales were only 0.5 per cent above the previous month.
April outlays for durable goods were up 3.1 per cent, as the
5.9 per cent gain of the automotive group more than offset a 1.7
per cent decline for furniture and appliances. Sales of nondurable
goods advanced 0.7 per cent, but probably declined in real terms. Out-
lays for the food group were virtually unchanged but sales of the
general merchandise category rose almost 1 percentage point following a
strong gain in March. Sales of gasoline stations rose 6.5 per cent
and were about 15 per cent above a year earlier, but prices have risen
very sharply in recent months and by March were 42 per cent above a year
earlier.

Unit sales of consumer durables. April sales of new
domestic-type autos were at a 7.8 million unit annual rate, 6 per cent
above the rate in February and March but a fifth below that of April a
year ago. Large cars sold at a 5.2 million unit rate, up 8 per cent
from March but a fourth below last year. Sales of domestic-type small
cars continued to show little change at a 2.6 million unit annual rate,
the same as in March but 13 per cent below a year earlier. The small
car share edged down further accounting for 33 per cent of domestic-
type sales, slightly below 34 per cent a month earlier but up from 30
per cent a year earlier.
Stocks of all domestic-type new cars continue to decline on a
seasonally adjusted basis. Combined with the increased sales of April,
stocks were equivalent to a 58 days supply, down from a 63 days supply
at the end of March and a recent high of 69 days supply at the end of
December.
Foreign auto sales in April were at a 1.3 million unit annual
rate, down 10 per cent from a month earlier and a third below the same
month a year ago. The import share of the market, seasonally adjusted,
amounted to 14 per cent, down from the 16 per cent of both a month and
a year earlier.
Factory sales of major home appliances, TVs, and radios in
April are estimated to have declined 7 per cent from March; all items
included in the index, except washers and driers, were below the March
levels.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods declined 2.4 per cent in March (p), following a 1.7 per cent rise
in February. Much of the drop occurred in defense capital goods;
excluding this category, orders were down about 1 per cent. Nondefense
capital goods orders were off 2.6 per cent (compared with the 4.7 per
cent drop indicated in the advance report) after rising 4.0 per cent in
February.
For the first quarter, as a whole, new orders for durable
goods fell 1.7 per cent (p) following a fourth quarter rise of about
the same size. Orders for motor vehicles and parts and for primary
metals were very weak in the first quarter, and the rise in nondefense
capital goods orders slowed perceptibly. In real terms, new durable
goods orders were off 5 per cent in the first quarter and orders for
nondefense capital goods were essentially unchanged.

Shipments of durable goods were off slightly in March and
down 0.8 per cent for the first quarter as a whole. Unfilled orders
continued to rise but a bit more slowly than previously.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturing and trade inven-
tories increased at a $30 billion annual rate in March (p), following
a $37 billion rate in February. For the first quarter as a whole,
the book value increase was $35.4 billion annual rate--about the same
as in the fourth quarter. The current first quarter estimate is about
$3 billion below the $38 billion January-February (p) average rate
which was available at the time the preliminary first quarter GNP esti-
mates were made by the Commerce Department.
In manufacturing, the $21 billion annual rate of increase in
book value in the first quarter was a bit more rapid than the fourth
quarter rate. By stage of processing, stocks of materials and supplies
and of finished goods rose more rapidly in the first quarter than in the
fourth while work-in-process inventories grew more slowly. Auto stocks
at retailers dropped $2.5 billion, annual rate, in the first quarter and
this was the major factor making for slower growth of retail inventories.
Wholesale trade inventories grew more rapidly in the first quarter than
in the fourth mainly because of rapid increases in prices.

The overall manufacturing and trade inventory-sales ratio
edged down from 1.45 to 1.44 in March, thus continuing at the low
level of late 1972 and early 1973. The ratio of inventories to unfilled
orders at durable goods producers was about unchanged at .713.

labor cost, building permits, initial claims for unemployment insurance
(inverted) and common stock prices. New orders for durable goods, the
average workweek in manufacturing, and contracts and orders for plant
and equipment all declined.
Leading indicators available for April are the average work-

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted outlays
for new construction put in place edged off further in April. Except
for a temporary rise in February, such outlays have tended downward in
every month since July 1973, primarily reflecting lower private resi-
dential expenditures which were down further in April to a level 20 per
cent below their February 1973 peak. Private nonresidential and public
construction outlays also slackened from their peaks 2 months earlier.
With construction costs continuing to rise, the total value of new
construction in constant dollars dipped again in April and was 13 per
cent below the January 1973 high.

Merchant builder sales of new single-family homes, up sharply
in March, increased 9 per cent during the first quarter. This was the
first quarterly rise since the fourth quarter of 1972, although it was
still three-tenths below the peak rate in that quarter. Stocks of
unsold new homes declined only slightly in March and, even at the
improved sales rate, represented more than 9 months' supply. The
median price of units sold was up 3 per cent further and continued
above the rising median price of units for sale. Sales of used homes
remained moderately below a year earlier, while the median price of
such units, at $31,350, rose 2 per cent and was more than a tenth above
March 1973.
Residential rental vacancy rates in the first quarter of
1974 averaged 6.2 per cent. While this was the highest average since
the second quarter of 1965, it was well below the peak reached in that
year. The increase reflected, in part, the relatively high pace of
completions and a shift into the rental category of condominiums and
other "for sale" units for which demands had slowed appreciably this
winter. Even so, at 1.2 per cent, the homeowner vacancy rate remained
at the high average of last year's fourth quarter.

Anticipated plant and equipment spending. The latest
McGraw-Hill survey, conducted in March and early April, indicates that
businesses are planning a 19 per cent increase in plant and equipment
outlays during 1974--a little more than reported two months earlier.
Manufacturing industries continue to plan especially large increases,
with primary metals and nonelectrical machinery showing the greatest
strength among durable producers, and petroleum, paper, and chemicals
planning the sharpest gains within the nondurable groupings. Outside
of manufacturing, mining, railroads and public utilities are planning
large increases. The survey also indicates that manufacturers plan
to devote 53 per cent of this year's anticipated capital expenditures
to expansion, up from an average of 49 per cent since 1968. Manufac-
turing capacity is expected to increase by 6 per cent this year, close
to the recent historical average but below the 7 per cent rise reported
for 1973.

I -23
This McGraw-Hill survey, as did the preceding one, shows
significantly more strength than the latest Commerce survey; this
discrepancy can largely be attributed to bias adjustments and the
dominance of large firms in the McGraw-Hill sample.

Labor market. The unemployment rate edged off 0.1 per cent
in April for the second month in a row. The drop was primarily the
result of labor force withdrawals by teenagers and adult men; however,
some firming in labor demand was evident in payroll employment, which
rose by 125,000 in April.
Unemployment recently has hit hard workers with strong labor
market attachment. Despite declines in their labor force, the unemploy-
ment rates for prime working age men (25-54 years) and married men
have been rising. Although initial claims for unemployment insurance
suggest that layoffs have slowed, there has been no significant re-hiring
and insured unemployment has risen considerably since January.

The civilian labor force has shown a small net decline since
January. Slowing in labor force growth during a period of reduced
output growth is not unusual, as fewer marginal workers enter and
some leave the labor market. The monthly pattern of labor force
growth is volatile--frequently, several months of little or no growth
are followed by a big jump. Part of the recent drop in the labor force
has occurred among teenagers (which is unusual). Meanwhile, labor
force growth among adult women has continued at the rapid pace of 1973.
Payroll data for April suggest some improvement in labor
demand from the winter months and the March data have been revised
upward considerably and now show only a small decline. The April
payroll advance was led by a 75,000 gain in manufacturing (concentrated
in transportation equipment)--the first factory job increase since
November, when the impact of the oil embargo was first felt. The
volatile construction series showed a decline for the second month.
Since last November, total payroll employment has increased at a half
million annual rate, compared to 2-3/4 million over the four quarters
of 1973. Manufacturing employment however remains well below its
recent peak in that month. The factory workweek, after edging down
for several months, dropped sharply in April. Most of the decline
probably is attributable to the fact that Good Friday fell within the
survey period, but some of it may have reflected an attempt to reduce
labor inputs.

Earnings. The average hourly earnings index for private non-
farm production workers rose strongly in April and figures for the
preceding two months were revised up. Since April 1973, the index has
risen by 7.1 per cent--compared to 6.7 per cent over the four quarters
of 1973--with the largest increases in manufacturing and services.
The recent acceleration probably reflects a response to the prolonged
period of decline in real spendable earnings, and rapid wage increases
are likely to continue.

Collective bargaining. Major collective bargaining agreements
in the first quarter provided somewhat larger wages increases than
settlements reached in 1973, but continued to be relatively moderate.
However, these data exclude possible cost-of-living increases provided
in agreements which cover more than half the workers bargaining during
the period. Also, in a number of recent contracts cost-of-living
protection has been extended and improved.
Settlements concluded in the first quarter covered only about
500,000 workers--about 10 per cent of those scheduled to bargain this
year. First year wage adjustments averaged 6.2 per cent, up from the
5.8 per cent gain in 1973. Slightly larger increases were evident in
both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors where major settle-
ments included the can, aluminum, food, and transit industries. Pay
increases in construction remained modest. Over the life of the
contract, wage adjustments were about the same as in 1973, and wages

and benefits combined averaged 5.9 per cent over the life of the
contract--down slightly from 6.1 per cent in 1973.

Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices rose 0.7 per cent,
seasonally adjusted, between March and April. The change reflected
another sharp increase in prices of industrial commodities, only
slightly less than the average of the last six months, and the largest
drop in prices of farm products and foods in the last six months.
The index of industrial commodities increased by 2.3 per cent,
seasonally adjusted (not at an annual rate), to a level more than 20
per cent above that of April 1973. Price increases were widespread,
but those for metals, pulp and paper products, chemicals, and machinery

I -29
and equipment were especially important. The index of refined
petroleum products, a prime mover in the rise in the WPI in recent
months, declined for the first time since last August as prices of
both gasoline and distillates fell.

Since the April pricing date of the WPI, announcements of
price increases have included those for steel mill products, copper,
and motor vehicles. What the precise quantitative effect of these
changes will be on the May WPI is not yet known, but we estimate that
of themselves they will probably amount to an increase of about one-
half per cent.
Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose at nearly a 13 per cent
annual rate in March--almost as much as in February. Despite a fall in
meat prices, the advance for foods was at a substantial 9 per cent
rate. Prices of other commodities and services, however, advanced
even more than in January and February, and the first-quarter rise in
the CPI marked a sharp acceleration from the already large quarterly
increases of 1973.
The acceleration for nonfood commodity prices since December
appears to have wiped out much of the lag which had developed with
respect to increases at the wholesale level. This is not apparent in
the aggregate CPI and WPI statistics because the latter are distorted
by an enormous rise in the index for refined petroleum products (revised
index to appear in June). If we look at comparable commodity groupings,
however, we now find only a few for which a substantial "catch up" at
retail still seems needed.

In March, apart from meats, poultry and eggs, most food groups
registered further large increases, though not quite so much as in
February. Beef prices, however, fell 2 per cent and have declined
further since the early-March CPI pricing dates. Pork prices have also
declined substantially, following the fall in animal prices, but the
farm-retail spreads for both pork and beef continued high in April,
according to preliminary Department of Agriculture data.

Gasoline prices rose about 6 per cent (seasonally adjusted,
hot annual rate) for the third successive month, but fuel oil prices
were down somewhat. Apparel prices were up about one per cent, as in
February, and those of other nondurables, as well as of household
durables, continued to advance strongly.

The rise in service costs accelerated in March as large and
widespread advances were registered for most categories. Since
December, gas and electricity rates have increased nearly 7 per cent,
medical services nearly 3 per cent, and housekeeping and home main-
tenance services 4 per cent (not annual rates, not seasonally adjusted).
Agriculture. Prices received by farmers fell 6 per cent
during the month ending April 15, but they were still 17 per cent above
a year earlier. Lower prices for livestock, grains, and oilseeds were

I -33
only partly offset by higher cotton and potato prices. By early May,
wheat and hog prices had fallen another 27 per cent and 15 per cent,
respectively, and there were smaller declines in cattle, corn, soybean,
and cotton prices.
Recent declines in feed grain prices have not been large
enough to make livestock feeding profitable, partly because hog and
cattle prices also have fallen further. Based on price relationships
during the first week in May, hog and cattle feeders would lose about
$10 and $75 respectively on each animal marketed. Losses are reflected
in the reduced scale of feedlot operations as marketings of fed cattle
continues to outnumber placements.
April production of red meat and poultry was 2 per cent below
the March level, seasonally adjusted, but cold storage stocks of meat
and poultry are at very high levels. On March 31, beef and pork stocks
were about 40 per cent above a year ago while poultry stocks were 90
per cent larger.
The 1974 grain crop outlook is good with record acreages
and yields expected to result in a 27 per cent larger winter wheat
crop, compared to a year ago. Sowing of the expected 4 per cent larger
feed grain acreage is ahead of recent years. Planting of the expected
18 per cent greater cotton acreage is ahead of last year but behind
other recent years.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Business credit demands in short- and long-term markets
continued large through April. Financial and nonfinancial businesses
drew heavily on bank lines last month, with some of this demand repre-
senting shifts from other financial markets. Although capital market
financing remained large, scheduled corporate bond issues aggregating
about $650 million were either postponed or cancelled in April and
outstanding nonbank commercial paper declined a further $800 million
last month. Investors were reported to be increasingly hesitant to
purchase less than the highest quality obligations in the commercial
paper market, and some issuers, particularly REIT's, had to draw on
bank lines to refund maturing paper.
Banks financed their continued large credit demands in large
part by very heavy CD borrowing and by tapping the Euro-dollar and
commercial paper markets. Enlarged bank demands for short-term funds,
in combination with the System's restraint on reserve availability,
led to increases of up to 1-1/2 percentage points in short-term rates
since the last Committee meeting. Most recently CD offering rates have
trended downward for the highest quality issues, with the range of
offering rates on 90 day paper between 11 and 11-1/2 per cent.
While Treasury bill rates have moved through a wide range,
they did not rise as much as other short-term rates, and the three-
month bill rate most recently has been below its level at the time of
the last FOMC meeting. Bills have been in scarce market supply
partly as a result of foreign and Federal Reserve purchases. In

II -2
addition, demand for Treasury securities from domestic investors
has been strong, reflecting in part increased investor emphasis on
higher quality assets. Also, the bill market has been influenced by
anticipated reinvestment from the $1.5 billion mid-May paydown in
the current Treasury refunding,
Rate increases in longer-term markets have been substantially
less than in short-term markets. Rates on securities have risen from
20 to 40 basis points, as buying interest--particularly on the part of
small investors--increased at the higher yields. Small investors have
been increasingly attracted to the entire maturity spectrum of market-
able financial assets in recent weeks, and noncompetitive tenders for
bills and recent Treasury and agency notes and bond offerings have
been large.
Paralleling the public's shift to market instruments, inflows
of savings to thrift institutions slowed in April and there were reports
that in early May inflows continued weak, with outflows at New York and
Massachusetts savings banks. Thrift institutions were forced to liquidate
assets (including, it is reported, corporate bonds at the Massachusetts
savings banks), to step up their borrowing from the FHLB and related
sources, and probably to cut-back on their new mortgage commitment
activity. At commercial banks, the estimated inflow of time and
savings deposits in denominations of less than $100,000 moderated
sharply in April, but banks, in the aggregate, were able to supplement
the slower consumer-type inflows with negotiable CD's and other large
denomination time deposits.

II -3
Rates on new mortgage commitments rose 45 basis points since
the last Committee meeting, with S&L's reporting mortgage funds in short
supply in 11 of 12 FHLB districts; at the time of the last FOMC meeting,
only 2 Districts reported inadequate supplies of funds. The current
primary mortgage rate nationally averages nearly 9 per cent, which is
at or above the mortgage rate ceiling in 16 states. It also compares
with rates on FHLB advances in excess of 10 per cent for those maturing
in under one year and 8-3/4 per cent for the special subsidized advance
program announced May 10.
Foreign financial flows through the U.S. banking system re-
mained sizeable in April and early May. Foreign deposits at New York
City banks, mainly foreign official time accounts, increased about $1
billion in this period, probably reflecting the lower relative yield
available on Treasury bills. Bank lending to foreigners was also active.
About $500 million of loans were made to foreign commercial banks by
Midwestern and Western U.S. banks, less than half to Japan with the
balance broadly distributed. And about $400 million was lent to foreign
businesses, with a significant share accounted for by a loan to a French
firm for the purpose of financing oil imports.
Outlook. The recent Board announcement regarding the avail-
ability of Federal Reserve credit to Franklin National appears to have
been well taken in financial markets. However, investors can be expected
to continue to favor high quality borrowers in coming weeks. Thus,
Treasury and agency securities, as well as prime name CD and commercial
paper issues, are likely to be in good demand. Yield spreads between
such instruments and lower quality assets are likely to widen.

II -4
The emphasis on credit quality could make market financing
more difficult and more expensive for some borrowers, and a number of
these may be forced to fall back on banks as a last resort. To the
extent that individual banks facing such increased loan demands may
experience difficulties in selling their CD's, liquidity pressures would
intensify. In any event, given the present structure of market rates,
the prime loan rate may be expected to rise somewhat further in the
weeks ahead. Such pressures would be intensified if loan demands at
banks continue strong. Under such circumstances, banks could also be
expected to withdraw further from the tax-exempt and mortgage markets.
The attractive yields available on market instruments are
likely to contribute to continued difficulties for thrift institutions.
As inflows to intermediaries remain limited, mortgage market conditions
will tighten further. However, increased support activity by the housing
agencies, particularly with the housing programs already announced by
the Administration, may be expected to limit upward pressures on mortgage
rates and to increase credit availability. The increased supply of
agency securities will at the same time though add to upward rate
pressures in securities markets generally and exacerbate the problem of
the thrift institutions.

II -5
Monetary aggregates. The latest data available indicate
that M1 in April slowed somewhat relative to the rapid March pace,
expanding at a 7.9 per cent annual rate, somewhat lower than estimated
earlier. At its level in April, the narrow money stock was 6.7 per cent
higher than 12 months previously. Foreign official and foreign commercial
bank demand balances accounted for roughly 2 percentage points of the
April growth, after having contributed little to the March expansion.1/
Despite the slower growth of M1 in April, expansion of M2 was essentially
the same as in March, due to a pick-up in "other time" deposits.
However, reduced inflows to nonbank thrift institutions lowered the rate
of growth of M3.
The strength of commercial bank "other time" deposits is not
indicative, of inflows of small denomination deposits in April. Esti-
mates based on data reported by member banks subject to marginal reserve
requirements suggest that large time deposits included in M2--i.e.,
those other than negotiable CD's at weekly reporters--may have accounted
for most of the April strength in this component. After removal of these
large time deposits, the estimates shown in the table indicate that
savings and small denomination time deposits at commercial banks slowed
markedly in April, paralleling the reduction of inflows to thrift
institutions. While these estimates are subject to some uncertainty in
reflection of the lack of knowledge regarding the typical seasonal
movement in large time deposits, it is clear that consumer type deposit
inflows at banks in April slowed markedly.

Quarter is presented in the Greenbook Supplement.

and large negotiable and nonnegotiable CD's at nonweekly reporting

CD's at weekly reporting banks. The figures in column 2 reflect the

II -8
Although aggregate net inflows of demand and other time
deposits were relatively strong in April, they were not sufficient to
meet the continued rapid expansion in bank credit demands. As a result,
large banks had to expand their already heavy reliance on the negotiable
CD market in April, raising CD offering rates in the process by about
1.5 percentage points. The average volume of outstanding CD's increased
by a record breaking $7.6 billion during the month, and CD sales have
continued strong in early May. From the end of February to early May,
outstanding CD's have increased by close to $12 billion (seasonally
adjusted)--the sharpest percentage increase (17.5 per cent) for any
two month period since the spring of 1970.
About 85 per cent of CD sales in this period have been con-
centrated in the major money market centers of New York, San Francisco
and Chicago. Although these three centers have traditionally accounted
for a large proportion of CD sales, their share of recent net issues
has been somewhat larger than their share of outstandings--especially
in San Francisco. Banks in this city, while accounting for only 11
per cent of total outstanding CD's, were responsible for 30 per cent
of the overall March-April increase. A survey of selected member banks
in the three districts suggests that somewhat greater than normal
sales of CD's were being made to commercial banks and to commercial
bank trust departments seeking high yielding liquid assets, and to
foreigners; somewhat fewer sales were made to nonbank financial insti-
tutions.
In addition to CD sales, banks also continued to borrow Euro-
dollars in April and to obtain funds from their affiliates' issuance of

II -9
commercial paper. With these other sources of funds rising, the
adjusted credit proxy in April rose at the fastest rate in the history
of the series--nearly a 32 per cent annual rate.
Bank credit. Total loans and investments of commercial banks--
last-Wednesday-of-the-month series, seasonally adjusted--expanded at a
16.5 per cent rate in April, continuing the strong growth trend of
the first quarter. As in March, rapidly expanding business credit
demands provided the main source of bank credit growth in April, with
business loans rising at a 35 per cent annual rate. Additional demands
for bank credit in April came from nonbank financial institutions and
foreign commercial banks. In contrast, security loans declined, and
consumer loans--which have evidenced slower growth since the beginning
of the year reflecting the weakness in retail sales generally--stopped
growing entirely in March and were estimated to remain unchanged in
April.
Banks added moderately to their security holdings in April,
acquiring both U.S. Treasury issues and some tax warrants. However,
liquid asset holdings of banks rose less rapidly than liabilities, and
at large banks the liquidity ratio dropped to the lowest level since
July. Although the ratio of liquid assets to liabilities at these large
banks has declined almost a percentage point since January, it still
remains well above the very low levels reached in 1969-70.
The expansion of business loans in April continued to be
broadly based across industry categories, with only loans to commodity
dealers showing weakness. Trade, manufacturing, public utilities, metals,
chemical and rubber, and mining firms all borrowed heavily during the month,

as they had in March, along with foreign businesses. The weakness in com-
modity loans probably reflects some paying down of borrowings which had
been very large earlier in the year and in late 1973.
Despite a 2 percentage point rise in the prime rate in April and
early May, many nonfinancial business borrowers in April, as in March,
still found bank credit to be relatively more attractive than the commer-
cial paper market.1/ In addition, in recent weeks there have been reports
of increasing hesitancy on the part of investors to acquire lower quality
commercial paper, causing some paper issuers to draw more heavily on their
bank lines. Also, bank credit has apparently been buoyed by cancellations
and reductions in the size of scheduled corporate bond offerings as the
cost of capital market financing continued to rise.

FOOTNOTE 1 FROM P. II-10.
1/ A 50 basis point spread of the prime rate over the commercial paper
is considered "normal". With the paper rate most recently at
11-1/8 per cent, a prime rate of 11-5/8 would be required to
establish this rate relationship, but the volume of paper being sold
is so small that the paper rate itself may not be indicative of
equilibrum rate pressures.

Reflecting special factors, and despite continued reductions
in outstanding dealer placed commercial paper, total short-term credit
flows to business increased at a historically high 31 per cent annual rate
in April. While, as noted above, some shifting from long to short-term
markets has occurred, the sustained pace of total short-term credit
demands since year-end has been unusually large. Available data suggest
that this strength cannot be explained by inventory accumulation alone, even
when adjusted for inflation. Reduction in estimated internal funds gen-
eration in the corporate sector for the first quarter suggest that total
external financing needs have been rising faster than anticipated. More-
over, it is possible that aggregate measures of the financing gap tend to
understate credit requirements in some industries.
Accompanying the expansion in business credit in April, banks
extended a large amount of credit to nonbank financial institutions, both
finance companies and others. With the cost of commercial paper rising
rapidly and with more selective investors, finance companies no doubt
shifted at least some of their borrowing from the commercial paper
market to banks; the rise in bank loans to finance companies was accom-
panied by a decline of $600 million in directly placed commercial paper
in April. Loans to institutions other than finance companies were also
very strong especially in California and New York City. In California,
S&L's and mortgage companies were responsible for a large proportion of
such loans, while in New York City, REIT's accounted for a significant
share followed by mortgage and insurance companies.

Loans by large U. S. banks to foreign commercial banks, which
had increased over $1 billion in March, rose an additional $500 million
in April. Most of these loans were extended by banks in San Francisco
and Chicago; while some of the borrowing was identified with Mexican
and Japanese customers, the large share of such loans was reportably
distributed among a wide number of countries. The growth in borrowings
by foreign businesses in April, of about $400 million, was concentrated
primarily in one large bank which reported borrowings by French interests
related to oil payments.

II -14
Nonbank financial intermediaries. Seasonally unadjusted
sample data indicate that nonbank thrift institutions experienced net
deposit outflows during April. On a seasonally adjusted basis, growth
at S&L's and MSB's is estimated to have fallen sharply below the
first quarter pace. Some of the slowing is undoubtedly attributable
to the mid-April tax payment date, but small investors apparently have
turned increasingly to competing market instruments offering higher
yields--especially Treasury securities, as evidenced by the exceptionally
large amount of noncompetitive tenders in recent Treasury offerings.

NOTE: These growth rates incorporate revised seasonal adjustment pro-

Unfavorable deposit experience at both S&L's and MSB's has
continued in the early part of May. A sample of 17 large New York City

II -15
mutual savings banks experienced a $13 million outflow during the first
five business days of May, compared to inflows averaging $50 million
during the comparable period in recent years. A sample of 13 large
S&L's in California had only a small net inflow during the first few
days of May--a period when deposit inflows are normally strong.
Advances from the FHLBanks to S&L's increased by over $1
billion in April. Even though the FHLBB attempted in late April to
slow the pace of borrowings by imposing stricter standards of need,
the net increase in advances during the first 10 days of May totaled
approximately $300 million. As a result, the liquidity of the FHLBank
System has declined to about $750 million, below the low point reached
last summer.
During April, $175 million out of $1.7 billion of special
forward commitments were taken down. Under this program S&L's paid
a 1/4 per cent commitment fee last fall to obtain commitments for
8-1/2 per cent, 2-year advances which could be taken down six months
to one year from the date of the commitment. At current rate levels,
advances under the special program are quite attractive relative to
other borrowings.
Fragmentary data from large life insurance companies indicate
that policy loan activity during April increased from the first quarter
pace, but did not approach the record volume experienced last August
and September. At this point, life insurance company representatives

II -16
indicate that these institutions are in relatively comfortable cash
positions and appear to be prepared for increased policy loan demands.
Long-term securities markets. Bond yields rose further over
the inter-meeting period. In the corporate market, the advance was
somewhat slower than it has been in the preceding 2 months, with the
indexes for new and recently-offered Aaa utility issues moving up
roughly 1/4 of a percentage point. As rates neared the record levels
of 1970, investor buying interest seemed to increase--particularly
among individuals. Nevertheless, no sustained rally developed in the
face of a further increase in short-term rates, still rapid inflation,
and higher forecasts of business investment. Furthermore, dividend
omissions by Consolidated Edison and Franklin New York heightened
investor concern about the quality of credit. Yields on municipals
increased a bit more than corporate yields and there was no indication
of a deceleration in the rate uptrend in that market. The relative
rise, on a taxable-equivalent basis, of municipal yields is attributable
in part to decreased commercial bank interest.
Although the Dow-Jones Industrial average fluctuated in a
narrow range around 850, the broader NYSE composite index declined to
the lowest level in 4 years. Utilities and financial corporation shares
were exceptionally weak. Trading volume was light, worsening the
economic strains on securities firms.

Corporate bond volume declined in April and was substantially
below earlier estimates, as the rise in rates led to approximately $650
million in postponements of scheduled offerings. However, some of
these postponed issues were scaled down and rescheduled for May, adding
to a substantial volume of other scheduled offerings. Publicly-offered

$2.1 billion, is forecast for June. This would put second quarter
public bond volume above the first quarter level, and sharply higher
than the 1973 average. Corporate stock and privately placed bond
volume is estimated to have been light in April and is expected to
continue so in May and June.

Total corporate security offerings in the first half of 1974
have been exceptionally large, particularly when considered in light of
the contemporaneous surge in short-term business borrowing. There have
clearly been large needs for funds to finance plant and equipment
expenditures and for working capital, and internal funds generation
has slowed. The financing gap may in fact be greater than is indicated

II -19
by preliminary GNP accounts data. Examination of recent corporate
earnings reports suggests that profits in the first quarter may have
been significantly lower than the implicit Commerce Department
estimate.
Tax-exempt bond offerings were somewhat larger than expected
in April, with a major New York City issue boosting the total above the
average of recent months. There were a number of issue postponements.
The forecasted May and June volumes represent a return to something
closer to first quarter levels and assume an increased volume of
postponements. Municipal bond offerings continue to be augmented by
a large volume of pollution control issues, including some sizable
floatations for oil company facilities. In addition, short-term
borrowing by State and local units has increased in recent months,
and this may reflect some temporary deferment of long-term financing,
as well as pressure on current municipal budgets from rising expendi-
tures and slower growth of tax receipts.

II -20
Consumer credit. The net increase in total consumer credit
outstanding during March amounted to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of $10.4 billion; instalment credit advanced $7.4 billion, and growth
in noninstalment debt reached $3.0 billion. Even though the increase
in total credit was the largest since November--when growth was at a rate
of nearly $23.0 billion--the underlying data for March indicate no
significant change in the pattern of instalment borrowing from the re-
duced December-February level. The sharply lower rate of expansion in
instalment debt in this year's first quarter, as compared with a year
earlier, reflects a virtual leveling in extensions and a continued
rise in repayments.
The slowing since last November has been centered in automobile
loans and "other consumer goods" credit. Automobile debt declined $720
million in March, seasonally adjusted annual rate, and showed no growth
during the first quarter for the first time since the strike-affected
fourth quarter of 1970. Other consumer goods credit outstanding in-
creased at a $4.5 billion annual rate in the first quarter, down
sharply from the preceding quarter. More than two-fifths of the first
quarter growth in other consumer goods credit resulted from a further
expansion in bank credit card outstandings; during the fourth quarter,
growth in these balances accounted for less than one-fifth of the
growth in other consumer goods indebtedness.
Consumer finance rates on new car contracts purchased from
dealers by the major automobile finance companies declined in March
for the third month in a row. At 12.29 per cent, rates averaged 13
basis points below the December peak but were 44 basis points above a

II -21
year earlier. The recent easing reflects not only reduced loan
demand but also lagged reaction to declines in other market rates during
the fourth quarter of 1973. The average amount financed per new car
contract (excluding finance charges) rose to $3,450 in March, slightly
above the previous high reached last October. The increase in contract
amount can be traced to higher unit prices and to a modest expansion
in the proportion of sales accounted for by large cars, rather than to
an easing of downpayment requirements as the ratio of amount financed
to wholesale value, at 88 per cent, remained unchanged for the sixth
consecutive month. Meanwhile, auto loan delinquency rates at major
finance companies declined 14 basis points in March from the near-
record February rate of 2.66 per cent.

Short-term markets. Private short-term interest rates have
continued to advance sharply since the April FOMC meeting, responding to
a further significant tightening of the Federal funds market and to the
persistence of strong credit demands, particularly at commercial banks.
Rates on 3-month commercial paper and bank CD's, for example, are up
about one percentage point to levels of 11 per cent and 11-1/8 per cent,
respectively. And banks, faced with strong loan demands and sharply
rising costs of funds to service these demands, have generally raised
their prime rates into the 11.00 to 11.25 per cent area.

Treasury bill rates generally rose in unison with private
short-term rates in late April and early May, but in recent days they
have declined sharply, reflecting the combination of reduced avail-
ability of issues to private investors and a strengthening in demands for
these issues. Dealer positions in bills, particularly short-term bills,
have been very low for some time now, because of Desk purchases of bills
for System and, more importantly, for customer accounts, and because of
the seasonal decline in bills outstanding associated with the runoff of
April tax anticipation bills. In conjunction with this shortage, demand
for these instruments has been bolstered in part by the positioning of
investors to utilize funds to be obtained from the Treasury's paydown of
$1.5 billion out of the $5.6 billion of debt maturing on May 15. In
addition, there have been reports of a shift in investor preference
toward securities (such as Treasury bill and coupon issues, Federal
Agency issues, and top grade CD's) of the highest quality, resulting
from the liquidity difficulties acknowledged by the Franklin National
Bank and rumored for some other banks.
A moderate relief to the shortage of bills should be forth-
coming, as the Treasury has announced its intention to add $200 million
to each of the weekly bill auctions starting on May 16 and running
through June 13. Other Treasury financing plans are discussed in the
Treasury Coupon section.
Treasury coupon market. Treasury coupon yields have also con-
tinued to advance since the April FOMC meeting, rising about 15 to 25
basis points on intermediate and long-term issues. The same factors
influencing developments in other sectors of the credit markets appear
mainly responsible for these increases.

from the general public aggregated nearly $1.7 billion, an unprecedented
40 per cent of the total public awards. As indicated by the table, auction

cover the low point in its cash balance just prior to the mid-June tax
payment date. The issue to be offered in this financing has not yet
been announced but it will probably be in the short-term area, possibly
a strip of bills. $4.5 billion of June tax anticipation bills are sched-
uled to mature, thereafter, and the Treasury should not need to return
to the market for additional money until sometime in the second half
of July. The calendar of Federal Agency borrowing--including operations
by both sponsored and budget agencies, as well as financial asset sales--
likely to be conducted over the near-term future appears quite heavy,
perhaps amounting to $3.0 billion or so in both June and July.
Mortgage market. The mortgage markets tightened markedly
during April and early May, following about six months of gradual
easing. Interest rates on new commitments for home mortgages have risen
sharply in both the primary and secondary mortgage markets since late
March. By May 10, S&L's reported funds in short supply relative to
demand in 11 of the 12 FHLBank districts--in contrast to the situation
in early April when all districts reported adequate supplies of funds.
Contract interest rates on new commitments for 80 per cent
conventional home loans at selected S&L's averaged 8.98 per cent by
May 10--58 basis points above the recent low late in March.1/ In
areas of the country with relatively liberal usury laws, rates were
generally higher--averaging as much as 9.38 per cent in the Los Angeles
area. While a few states have recently raised or eliminated usury
ceilings applicable chiefly to conventional home mortgage loans, 11
1/ According to the HUD(FHA) field office opinion survey, average
interest rates on new commitments for conventional new- and existing-
home mortgages rose by 30 basis points during April to levels of
8.90 per cent by the beginning of May. Also, the yield on 8-1/2 per
cent FHA-insured mortgages sold in the secondary market rose 51
basis points from that for comparable 8-1/4 per cent mortgages in
March.

II -26
states still have ceilings of 8-1/2 per cent or less and 6 states have
9 per cent ceilings. Despite the recent increases in home mortgage
rates, this type of investment has continued relatively unattractive
to diversified lenders as yields on new issues of high-grade utility
bonds have remained above even gross yields on home mortgages in most
areas of the country.
Average yields on accepted bids in FNMA's May 6 auctions of
short-term commitments to purchase FHA/VA home mortgages and high
loan-to-value conventional mortgages rose to 9.34 per cent and 9.44
per cent, respectively. Offerings in the latest two auctions declined
substantially from the volume posted in the March 25 and April 8 auc-
tions, due in part to FNMA's reimposition of its former $3 million
ceiling on the maximum size of competitive offers. In lieu of bidding
in the auctions, mortgage originators have also been taking increased
recourse to FNMA's one-year standby commitments which are available at
a posted yield that is somewhat above the auction average for contracts
to be delivered within 4 months.
Reflecting the moderate improvement in commitment activity
last fall and early in 1974, seasonally adjusted net mortgage debt
formation in the first quarter of 1974 increased slightly from the
relatively low rate of $14.2 billion in the previous quarter as S&L's
resumed their position as the dominant lender group. Seasonally ad-
justed new and outstanding commitments at S&L s actually increased
somewhat further in April, according to preliminary estimates. However,
outstanding commitments were still well below year earlier highs and,

with savings flows deteriorating, reliance on advances from the Federal
Home Loan Banks was increasing once again.
On May 10, the Administration announced a number of measures
designed to bolster the mortgage and housing markets over the period
ahead. These include an increase in the maximum permissible contract
interest rate on FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgages to a new high
of 8-3/4 per cent from the 8-1/2 per cent ceiling in effect since April 15
of this year. They also include the following plans for subsidizing
below-market rates on loans for potentially more than 300,000 units:
(a) a further expansion of GNMA's Tandem Plan to cover up to 100,000
new-unit FHA/VA mortgages bearing a special contract interest rate of
8 per cent; (b) authority for FHLMC to make forward commitments through
the end of 1974 to purchase up to $3 billion of 8-3/4 per cent conven-
tional new-home mortgages, financing perhaps 100,000 units; and (c)
authority for the FHLBanks to extend subsidized advances of up to $4
billion at a rate of $500 million per month during the remainder of this
year at an interest rate at least 1/2 percentage point below the FHLB's
own borrowing cost. Actually, the initial rate on such advances was
set at 8 per cent--3/4 point below the FHLB's latest 5-year debt issue
rate.
If money market conditions do not permit the FHLB System to
obtain the necessary funds from the private market to cover the FHLMC
forward commitments, it is understood that Treasury will provide finan-
cing under its statutory standby loan authority. Cost of the subsidized
advances, it is expected, will be met from FHLB System's undivided profits.

II -29
In addition, new rules were authorized to provide for FHA-insured
mobile home loans on terms appreciably better than those presently avail-
able in the market.
Agricultural finance. Following receipt of data on year-end
1973 farm loans at banks, net new borrowing by the farming sector in
1973 was again revised upward to a record $10.0 billion, 41 per cent
above the previous record of $7.1 billion set in 1972. In the second
half of 1973, outstanding farm loans at banks rose by 8.4 per cent, an
unexpectedly large gain in view of the seasonal declines generally
experienced during harvest periods. Farm loan demand on banks apparently
rose as farmers delayed marketings and accelerated purchases in order
to reduce 1973 taxable income as well as in response to expectations of
future price increases. In addition, several surveys have recently con-
firmed earlier indications that the availability of credit from suppliers
of farm inputs has been sharply reduced, with the loan demand shifted
to banks and production credit associations.
Through much of the first quarter, prices indicated for 1974 crop
output exhibited considerable strength and apparently stimulated further
increases in farm land prices. Nationally, farm land values on March 1
were estimated to have risen by 10 per cent since November 1 and by 25
per cent from a year earlier (preliminary and confidential USDA estimate).
West Coast States showed the lowest gains (10 to 15 per cent) for the
year ending March 1, whereas the increases in some Corn Belt States
exceeded 30 per cent.

Federal finance. On Monday, May 13, the Administration
requested a Congressional increase in the Federal debt ceiling to
$505 billion. Action on the debt ceiling will be needed by the end
of the fiscal year when the ceiling reverts to its permanent level.
However, in the absence of earlier action, the Treasury may also
have to resort to special measures to remain within the debt ceiling
near the end of May and just prior to the redemption of maturing
June tax bills.
At the debt ceiling hearings, the Administration presented
revised budget estimates for fiscal years 1974 and 1975. For the
current year, the outlays estimate has been revised downward to
$269.5 billion from the January projection of $274.7 billion.
In addition to an increase of $2.1 billion in offshore oil sales,
the new estimate primarily reflects a $1.0 billion decrease in
defense spending and reductions of $.9 billion and $1.6 billion,
respectively, in education and health programs. The major decreases
in the health area are in Medicare and Medicaid. The receipts
estimate for fiscal 1974 has been lowered by $4.0 billion to $266.0
billion, primarily reflecting the recent weakness in corporate income
tax collections. These receipts and outlays revisions have reduced
the Administration's estimated fiscal 1974 deficit from $4.7 billion
to $3.5 billion.
The staff's forecasts for the unified budget remain largely
unchanged since the April Greenbook, and are roughly similar to the
new Budget projections. Outlays are projected at the same level

II -32
of $269.5 billion as in the new Budget; this still implies an
acceleration in spending during May and June. Receipts are projected
at a slightly higher level of $266.7 billion, mostly due to higher
estimates for individual taxes.
Based on the experience in March and preliminary data for
April, it appears that we had consistently overestimated corporate
tax receipts this calendar year. The apparent shortfalls in final
payments on 1973 liabilities imply a significant drop in the effective
corporate tax rate from over 35 per cent in 1972 to 32 per cent in
1973. The shortfall in current payments in April suggest that the
effective rate in 1974 will continue at about the 1973 level. While
this phenomenon implies a possible redistribution of the share of
profits going to corporations with relatively low effective marginal
tax rates (such as those in the oil industry), it probably indicates
that the overall level of corporate profits in 1973 has been
overestimated.
Recent data implies that individual final payments on
1973 liabilities have remained higher than estimated, and that
disbursements of individual refunds have receded from their weekly
peak of $1.9 billion at the end of March to a level of $1.3 billion
for the week ending May 17. Together, these suggest a greater than
expected responsiveness of individual tax payments to the growth
in taxable income. In 1973, for each 1.0 per cent rise in taxable
income, there probably was a corresponding 1.4 per cent increase in
individual tax liabilities--a response which is at the high end of

II -33
the range of previous experience. Given the progressiveness of our
personal tax schedule, this undoubtedly reflects the impact of
inflation on nominal incomes, although it could also indicate a
redistribution of income going to individuals and unincorporated
businessess with higher than average marginal tax rates.
In fiscal year 1975, we are projecting a unified budget
deficit of $13.0 billion, compared to the Administration's revised
forecast of $11.4 billion. Both the staff's and the Administration's
outlays estimates--totaling $304 billion and $305.4 billion, respectively--
include additional spending for unemployment programs and interest
payments. While the staff is assuming a higher level of off-shore
oil sales (which are recorded as negative outlays in the Budget),
neither set of estimates includes the potential budget impact of
the President's recently announced plan to make more mortgage money
available. Depending on market conditions, Treasury loans to the
FHLB under this plan could add as much as $3.0 billion to fiscal
year 1975 outlays.
Despite an upward revision in income assumptions for
calendar 1974, particularly a $10 billion increase in corporate
profits before taxes, the Administration's new receipts estimate for
fiscal 1975 is $1.0 billion less than the January figure. The revised
estimate of receipts reflects lower corporate collections which more
than offset expected increases in personal taxes. The staff's estimate
of fiscal 1975 receipts is $3.0 billion less than the Administration's
$294.0 billion figure, despite our higher profits assumptions. This

II -34
is largely due to assumptions regarding new tax proposals. The
Administration's number assumes passage of the Ways and Means
Committee's proposal for a phaseout of the percentage oil depletion
allowance combined with a windfall profits tax. Together, these
would add about $1.3 billion to receipts in the coming fiscal year.
The staff has not allowed for the adoption of these proposals.
Moreover, in contrast with the revised Budget, we are assuming that
the Administration's proposed change in the withholding rate schedule
for individuals will be enacted; this latter assumption reduced our
fiscal year 1975 receipts estimate by $4.0 billion. Neither staff
nor Administration estimates include other tax legislation under
consideration in Congress.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. The weakness in the U.S. balance of
payments which began to appear at the end of January continued into
April and early May. In terms of the over-all balance on official
transactions there was a deficit on the order of $2 billion in
April (not seasonally adjusted), which would bring the accumulated
deficit after January to over $3½ billion. Meanwhile the dollar
has depreciated in the market by about 9 per cent from late January
to mid-May, in contrast to the buoyancy of the German mark.
A major element in this deterioration is the worsening
of the trade balance, which moved into substantial deficit in March
(an annual rate of $4.4 billion). Such a development had been
expected because of the higher price for oil, but other imports
-- foodstuffs and materials -- rose in both price and quantity in
March while exports, apart from agricultural sales, flattened out.
With oil imports still rising the April trade balance may have
also been a large deficit.
Another element in the picture has been stepped up
foreign lending by banks in the United States, with claims on
foreigners rising by about $5 billion in February-March, and,
according to weekly data, by further substantial amounts in April
and early May. Though the banks also substantially increased their
takings from the Euro-dollar market during this period, and their

III -2
liabilities to foreign official accounts increased, there was
a net outflow, on balance, after January. There was little or
no net inflow from transactions in securities in the first quarter,
and information on corporate capital flows is still scanty. In
general, however, the recent shift in the trade balance has not
been countered as yet by rising net capital inflows.
Looking ahead, projections of the trade balance point
to further weakening during this year and in early 1975. The
prospects for attaining reasonable over-all balance and exchange
rate stability depend largely on the extent to which income from
direct investments in petroleum abroad will grow and the extent to
which capital flows will begin to respond to the tightening of U.S.
credit markets. In the somewhat longer run, investment outlets in
the U.S. should prove attractive assoil producers begin to place
their excess funds into longer-term investments.
Trade deficits will also be experienced by other oil-
consuming countries, and efforts to contain these deficits may put
further stress on the U.S. trade situation. Many industrial countries
will also face more aggressive demands for wage increases than in the
past year, intensifying their inflation and payments problems. In
the background are anxieties about the safety of funds being
placed in international capital markets, and solutions are still
being sought for the special difficulties of financing oil
importers whose credit-worthiness is in doubt.

III -3
Foreign exchange markets. The dollar has depreciated in the ex-
changes by 2.8 per cent on a weighted average basis since mid-April, despite
a sharp change in interest differentials in favor of dollar-denominated
assets. The German mark led the appreciation of Continental currencies against
the dollar as the continued strong German trade balance persuaded the market
that the DM would appreciate. In recent days political developments in the
United States have tended to act as an additional depressant on the dollar.
Dollar intervention by major foreign central banks since mid-April has con-
sisted largely of dollar sales by the Bank of Italy and, to a lesser extent
by the Bank of France, together totaling perhaps $1 to 1-1/4 billion. This
intervention, of course, acted to depress the dollar in the exchange markets.
On May 14 and 15 the dollar snapped back sharply against Continental currencies
on the basis of news reports from Basle that concerted intervention by the
Federal Reserve, the Bundesbank, and the Swiss National Bank was under serious
consideration.

Speculation on a revaluation/appreciation of the mark, which had
flared up in March only to subside in early April, arose again after mid-
month with rumors in the market of forthcoming German trade figures for March
showing a DM 7 to 8 billion surplus. The actual figures, released at the
beginning of May, showed instead a DM 5 billion surplus, down slightly from
the previous month, but still very strong when compared with the rapid declines
of the trade balances of other industrial countries, including the United
States. The strength of the mark pulled up other snake currencies against the
dollar as snake central banks were obliged to purchase other snake currencies
against marks in the amount of nearly $500 million equivalent over the past
four weeks.
At the other end of the spectrum from the mark was the Italian
lira. The lira was supported by some $1 billion of market intervention by
the Bank of Italy in April, and continued to receive support at roughly
that rate in the first ten days of May.
After the first-round French election results and the public opinion
polls which indicated that Finance Minister Giscard d'Estaing was a very
slight favorite to win the runoff election for President, the French franc
appreciated sharply along with the Swiss franc and the currencies of the
mark bloc.
The Canadian dollar and sterling firmed moderately against the
dollar from mid-April while the Japanese yen showed little change.
Euro-dollar market. Rates on Euro-dollar deposits have risen sharply
in the past five weeks, particularly in the overnight category where the rate
earlier had lagged behind in the general advance underway since mid-February.

The overnight rate rose about two percentage points to an average of 11.3 per
cent in the week of May 15, in which week their cost to U.S. banks (including
required reserves) was about 80 basis points above the cost of Federal funds.
This differential was larger than earlier in the month, and contrasted sharply
with the situation in late March and early April when the differential was often
of opposite sign. The 3-month Euro-dollar rate moved up to an average of 11,7
per cent by the week of May 15, when it exceeded the U.S. 60-89 day CD rate
by 3/4 per cent.
U.S. banks' gross liabilities to their foreign branches increased
substantially from mid-March to early April, as the cost of Federal funds rose
relative to the cost of overnight Euro-dollars. Since then, liabilities to
branches have increased still further, although less rapidly than before, even
though the cost of overnight Euro-dollars relative to Federal funds has been
rising and is now greater than before mid-March. Gross liabilities to foreign
branches averaged $3.4 billion in the seven days ended May 10, compared with
$2.9 billion in the week of April 17 and about $2 billion in early March.
There has been little change in the relationships between the cost
to non-bank borrowers of short-term Euro-dollar loans and of short-term borrowing
in the United States, as indicated in the accompanying table showing rates
for prime borrowers.
Publicized medium-term Euro-currency bank loans arranged in April
are initially estimated at $2.7 billion by the World Bank, down from a monthly
average of $4.5 billion in the first quarter. (Almost all such loans are in
U.S. dollars). Arrangements in April for loans in excess of $100 million were

III -7
made by the Spanish Railways ($300 million), the City of Glasgow ($200 million),
the Central Bank of the Philippines ($150 million), the Kraft Corp. ($150
million), and the Argentine Maritime Agency (two loans totaling $157.5 million).
The Kingdom of Denmark arranged a $300 million loan in early May.

III -8
U.S. balance of payments. According to preliminary data, the
U.S. official settlements balance in April was in deficit by more than
$2 billion (not seasonally adjusted, not at an annual rate). This was
the third consecutive month of deficit (with the deficits becoming
increasingly large) and is in sharp contrast to the large surpluses
recorded in the fourth quarter of last year and in January. In addition,
the international value of the dollar depreciated by about 6-1/2 percent
against major foreign currencies from the average rate for January to
the average for April and has declined further in May. For the first
quarter as a whole, there was a small official settlements surplus,
$0.9 billion, seasonally adjusted, compared to a $2.7 billion surplus in
the fourth quarter.

actions for the first quarter and virtually no information is available

about April, it seems that the worsening in the overall balance largely
reflects a substantial weakening in the U.S. trade position and a large
shift from a net inflow to a net outflow of bank-reported private short-
term capital.
In March, the U.S. trade balance swung into substantial deficit
as the lagged effects of earlier oil price increases continued to push up
the price of imported oil and as other material prices continued to rise.
For the first quarter, the trade surplus was only $160 million compared
to a fourth quarter surplus of about $1-1/2 billion (not at an annual rate).
(See the discussion of trade on page 13.)
The bulk of the $4 billion shift from net inflow to net outflow
of private bank-reported short-term funds is attributable to the sizable
increase in foreign lending by banks in the United States (including U.S.
agencies and branches of foreign banks) in February and March. (See
the above table.) On the liabilities side, while there was a very large
capital inflow from abroad reported by banks in the United States, it
was about the same size as the fourth quarter inflow. In April, pre-
liminary weekly data suggest that bank claims on foreigners continued
to rise strongly, though not at the unusually high rate of February and
March; liquid liabilities to private foreigners, in April, appear to
have declined somewhat. (A more complete discussion of U.S. bank-
reported capital flows in March and April is on page 11.)

III -10
Net private security transactions apart from transactions by
international institutions (which mainly represent shifts among U.S.
assets) showed a small net outflow in the first quarter compared to a
relatively large net inflow in the fourth quarter of last year. Foreign
purchases of U.S. equity securities were declining during the quarter,
and offshore Euro-bond issues by U.S. corporations were virtually nil
in the first quarter compared to $.4 billion sales in the fourth quarter.
U.S. purchases of foreign securities were slightly greater in the first
quarter than in the fourth quarter, mainly because of increased purchases
of Canadian new issues. Scheduled offerings of foreign bonds in the
U.S. market in the second quarter by borrowers in countries previously
subject to the interest equalization tax are still relatively small.
Some prospective offerings by such borrowers have been withdrawn or
postponed because of the rise in U.S. interest rates.
The sum of the trade and capital transactions described above
more than explains the $2 billion decline in the official settlements
balance from fourth quarter 1973 to first quarter 1974. This would
suggest considerable improvement in other balance of payments accounts.
(See the table above.) One major missing category is corporate income and
capital flows; it may be that income receipts of oil companies were
rising sharply or that net corporate capital flows were relatively
favorable.

III -11
U.S. bank-reported capital flows. The net private capital out-
flow from changes in bank-reported claims and liabilities in February
($240 million) was followed by a $700 million net outflow in March.
The rise in gross claims in March was again large, and the net outflow
was held down greatly by a one-day surge in U.S. banks' Euro-dollar
borrowings at month-end. Partial data indicate that April will show
another net outflow, magnified by a decline in banks' Euro-dollar
borrowings from their exaggerated level at the start of the month.
In March, claims on foreigners rose $2.9 billion, bringing to
$5.0 billion the total increase since the end of January. Short-term
loans to foreign banks, together with acceptances for foreign account,
were up $1.4 billion, of which $700 million was increased credit to
Japanese borrowers. In addition to increasing demand for foreign
credit in Japan and elsewhere, the slower rise in U.S. short-term
interest rates relative to Euro-dollar rates during March attracted
foreign borrowers to the United States. Much of the remaining $1.5
billion increase in claims in March consisted of increases in
collections ($350 million) and in claims of New York agencies and
branches of foreign banks on their head offices ($530 million). All
agencies and branches increased their total foreign claims in March by
$1.2 billion.
Liabilities to private foreigners rose $2.2 billion in March,
all (and more) accounted for by a rise in U.S. banks' Euro-dollar
borrowings (liabilities to foreign branches) of $3.6 billion, of which

III -12
$2.0 billion occurred at month-end and was reversed April 1, in reflec-
tion of Friday technical factors. Liabilities of agencies and branches
of foreign banks fell $800 million, and liabilities to international
organizations decreased nearly $400 million (partly reflecting a
$215 million shift into Agency bonds by the IBRD).
In April, foreign claims of U.S. weekly reporting banks con-
tinued to rise, advancing $1.2 billion in the five weeks to May 1.
Relative movements of U.S. and Euro-market interest rates in April
itself do not appear to have been a major causal factor in this outflow,
which included loans to foreign governments and business firms as well
as banks. On the liabilities side, U.S. banks' liabilities to foreign
branches were down $1.5 billion -- all reflecting the $2 billion April 1
contraction -- and weekly data suggest a net decline for the month in
liabilities of agencies and branches of foreign banks as well.

III -13
U.S. foreign trade. The U.S. merchandise trade balance for
March was a deficit of $2.9 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate,
balance of payments basis), the first deficit in seven months. The shift
to a deficit in March reflects, in part, unusually large increases
in imports of foodstuffs and nonfuel industrial materials, and a sharp
reduction in exports of civilian aircraft, which typically show large
month-to-month fluctuations. The balance for the first quarter 1974
was $1.2 billion, compared with $5.4 billion for the fourth quarter
1973. A major source of this quarter-to-quarter deterioration was a
doubling of the cost of fuel imports.

The value of merchandise exports for the first quarter was up
by 11 percent over the preceding quarter, mainly because of higher prices.
The unit value of agricultural exports rose by 11 percent, with aggregate
volume holding steady. While the volume of shipments of wheat fell by
one-third in the first quarter 1974, and other food exports also fell

III -14
somewhat in volume, nonfood agricultural exports, notably tobacco and
cotton, rose substantially.
The value of agricultural exports may well decline in the
second half of the year. Spot export prices, which normally lead export
unit values by several months, have fallen off sharply from their
historically high levels in recent weeks. The spot export price of
wheat in the first week of May, for example, was about 30 percent below
its January-February peak. Record crops are anticipated in the United
States this year, and there may be further price declines.
The value of nonagricultural exports in the first quarter
rose by 10 percent over the fourth quarter 1973, including a 7 percent
increase in unit values. The sharpest price increases were for non-
agricultural industrial supplies and materials, particularly in commodities
such as coal and fertilizer, for which petroleum is either a substitutute
or a material input. There were also sharp increases in the unit values
of other basic commodities that are in short supply world-wide, including
iron and steel scrap, nonferrous metals and wood. Despite heavy foreign
demand, there was a decline in the quantity of coal and nonferrous metals
exported during the first quarter, as domestic producers, either troubled
by strikes or operating at peak capacity, were unable to produce enough
to accommodate total domestic and foreign demand. With the gradual
removal of domestic price controls, producers may have been encouraged
to supply relatively more to the domestic market as the spread between
world and domestic prices narrowed.

III -15
The value of consumer goods export continuted to rise -- by
16 percent in the first quarter -- with all of the increase attributed
to a surge in volume -- while a 7 percent increase in capital goods
exports reflected principally rising unit values. The backlog of foreign
orders for machinery remains high, and a continuation of the growth
in exports of such goods can be expected.
By region, the sharpest percentage increase in first-quarter
exports was to petroleum exporting countries (excluding Canada) -- up by
18 percent in the first quarter over the fourth quarter 1973. However,
imports from those countries increased even more shaprly -- reflecting
higher petroleum prices -- and our large trade deficit with them increased.
Meanwhile, our surplus with Western Europe increased, and our trade
balance with Japan shifted into a small surplus for the first time in
nearly ten years.
Imports of fuels and lubricants rose from $20.0 billion
(seasonally adjusted, annual rate) in February to $22.1 billion in March.
Unit values increased by almost 20 percent to over $11 per barrel, as
the impact of late December price increases was being reflected more fully
in import arrivals. The volume of petroleum imports in March was 5.5
million barrels per day, 30 percent below the pre-embargo peak in August
1973. With the suspension of the embargo the volume, and therefore the
value, of imports will probably increase substantially, though high prices
should have some restraining effect.

III -16
Non-fuel imports in the first quarter of 1974 were 8 percent
above their fourth quarter 1973 level, with much of the increase
attributable to rising volumes. Nearly half of the increase in value
was accounted for by industrial materials; imports of metals rose sharply,
partly because of tight supply conditions here, and partly in anti-
cipation of a possible strike in the copper industry. The partial removal
of domestic price controls may also have stimulated imports of high
priced metals, since these higher input costs could be more easily passed
on to the domestic consumer in the absence of administrative review of
price increases.
There were sizable increases in the import volumes of coffee,
cocoa and sugar, partly due to inventory accumulation in anticipation
of both possible future world price increases and a possible dock strike
in the fall; also, a 5 percent upward adjustment in the sugar quota was
made in January.
Automotive imports from Europe and Japan were also higher
in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter 1973, with much of the
increase going to replenish inventories that had been depleted during
1973. Foreign car sales in the United States have been weak over the
first four months of 1974, averaging 1.5 million units at an annual rate,
as compared with 1.8 million units in calendar 1973. The decline in
sales is due largely to relative price increases stemming from past
dollar depreciations and rising transportation costs and production costs
abroad. Imports may decline in coming months, especially as the supply
of domestically produced compacts increases.

III -17
Cost pressures in major foreign industrial countries. Pressures
which are likely to lead to continued high rates of price inflation
are already built into the economies of virtually all the major foreign
industrial countries. These pressures derive notably from two sources.
First, and probably most important, wage demands have been scaled up
considerably from the relatively modest levels of 1973 in an attempt
partly to catch up for past price increases but largely to insure against
future price increases. Indeed, to the extent that escalator clauses
have been included in a growing number of labor settlements, such cost
of living adjustments are inevitable.
Rates of increase of nominal earnings, real earnings, and
real GNP, are shown for major countries in Table 1. In spite of a
rapid rate of increase in wages and average earnings last year, sharp
increases in the cost of living -- especially beginning late last year --
have caused real wages to rise relatively slowly in many countries.
With the exception of France and Italy, real wages grew less rapidly
over the year to 1973-Q4 than they did in the preceding five years.
If the effects of progressive taxation and higher employee contributions
for various items are taken into account, the slowdown in the growth
of real wages is even more marked. Moreover, the slowdown took place
at a time when total real output had been rising at or above trend
rates. Consequently, labor's share of total income tended to fall in
many countries last year, again excluding notably France and Italy.

If output growth is sluggish this year -- as it is expected to be in
many countries -- labor is likely to attempt vigorously to protect its
share of income.
A second source of upward cost pressures that is already built
into the economy derives from the sharp increases in commodity prices
last year. In the discussion of price developments abroad in last month's
Greenbook, it was concluded that the large increases in raw food prices
seem to have worked through to the retail level to a considerable extent,
but that a good part of the increases in non-food commodity prices had
not yet been passed through. Of course, if commodity prices were to
fall, the upward pressures on domestic prices in the industrial countries
would tend to be offset at some later stage.
Authorities in many of the industrial countries have adopted
a variety of techniques to prevent these cost pressures from manifesting
themselves in higher prices. In most countries, except notably Canada,
by moderating the growth of aggregate demand through demand management
policies authorities hope that some easing of labor markets will tend
to restrain wage demands and that expectations of relatively weak demand
will reinforce industry's resistance to granting high wage demands.
Controls on incomes or prices -- such as those in force in the United
Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan and a number of smaller countries -- tend
to have similar effects. To the extent that price controls are effec-
tive, while controls on wages are absent or ineffective, industry's

III -21
profit margins, and consequently its investment plans, will be ad-
versely affected. But lower price increases may themselves moderate
increases in wage costs.
Other measures taken to moderate the increase in prices were
also cited in last month's Greenbook. They include Government subsidies
to keep down prices of some items that weigh heavily in workers' con-
sumption, reductions in indirect taxes, and other actions to absorb
the cost of higher social benefits in the Government budget rather
than in industrial costs. Of course, there may be inflationary impli-
cations in the consequently higher level of Government expenditures,
as well.
A more detailed discussion of important wage settlements in
some major countries, and of the growing use of escalator clauses,
follows.
In Germany, an increase in excess of Government guidelines
(of 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 per cent) in the salaries of public employees in
February of this year is being cited as a benchmark by other groups of
German workers. The February settlement provided for an increase of
about 13 per cent in average wages and salaries and other benefits.
Because wages in the public sector had risen faster than those in the
private sector in 1973, and the Government's aim is to preserve relative
shares, the bargaining position of workers in private industry seems
especially strong. Since the public employees' settlement, workers

III -22
in the metal industries have been awarded a 15 per cent increase.
About 700,000 workers in the chemical industry settled in early May
for a 12-13 per cent increase in wages. Settlements in the steel and
construction industries also exceeded the Government's guidelines.
One aspect of recently negotiated contracts in Germany, which
affects several sectors, is the inclusion of accelerating increases in
hourly rates in the last months of the contract period. Thus, a
"quasi-escalator" has been written into most recently negotiated
settlements. This contrasts with other countries, where contracts tend
to be "front-loaded". German unions are also bargaining for the
right to reopen wage talks before the official expiration of the con-
tract if price increases are much higher than expected.
Coalminers in the United Kingdom based their claim for a
35 per cent increase in wages this year largely on the fact that their
real earnings were growing slowly, relative to growth in the immediately
preceding years and relative to the growth of other workers' earnings.
After an overtime ban and strike which caused major disruption and
added costs to the economy, the miners were awarded virtually all they
had asked for. Both the Government and the Trades Union Congress ex-
pressed the view that the miners' settlement would not set a precedent
for other wage negotiations. In particular, they agreed that the
unions should adhere to the limits imposed by Stage III of the Con-
servative Government's counter-inflation policy until the Labour

III -23
Government abolishes those controls; subsequently, unions would abide
by a "social contract" in which they would exercise restraint in their
wage demands in exchange for desired social reforms. But demands and
statements by many unions -- including recently the large engineering
unions -- suggest that rank-and-file workers will not easily accept the
demands for moderation voiced either by the Government or their own
national leaders.
An estimated 15 per cent of all British employees have
escalator clauses in their contracts. Those clauses negotiated under
Stage III are triggered when the retail price index rises 7 per cent
above the October 1973 level. In March, the index had risen 6.1 per
cent, so that the clause is likely to be triggered this month or next.
When it is, wages automatically increase by roughly 1 per cent; there-
after each 1 per cent increase in the price index triggers a further
approximately 1 per cent increase in wages.
Workers in Italy, in contrast to those in most other countries,
did very well in 1973. Output was rising very rapidly, and wage
settlements were negotiated in the beginning of the year which provided
for very large increases immediately together with built-in escalator
clauses. This year, in what is generally regarded as a pattern-setting
agreement, Fiat accepted what were close to maximum union demands in the
contract negotiated in March. In order to maintain the fragile labor
peace, the Italian Labor Minister had intervened in the negotiation, and

III -24
had pressured Fiat into accepting the union demands. Fiat suffered
losses in 1973 as a whole due to the sharp fall in demand brought on
by the energy crisis at the end of the year; the March settlement will
increase their difficulties. In general, wage agreements during 1974
are expected to be very large. Other Italian firms enjoyed strong
profits last year and thus are better placed to absorb wage increases,
although the continuation of price controls will tend to narrow their
profit margins.
The anti-inflationary package announced in France at the
end of March renewed the price contracts between Government and industry,
which now include a 6-month moratorium on increases in real wages.
Nominal wage increases were tied to increases in the consumer price
index, although trade unions and opposition political parties do not
consider that index to be a true indicator of the cost of living. Pre-
sumably, a victory by M. Giscard d'Estaing in the forthcoming election
would imply little change in this policy. M. Mitterrand, on the other
hand, proposes an immediate 6-month price freeze (not to apply to farm
prices) coupled with major negotiations between labor and government
aimed at achieving a "new harmonization of incomes within the limits
of the country's present growth."
Real wages in the Netherlands remained virtually unchanged in
1973. Nominal wages per worker rose about 15 per cent, while the price
of consumer goods rose only 9 per cent. But social insurance contributions

III -25
were increased, and fiscal drag increased the tax burden, thus eroding
what would otherwise have been a substantial increase in real wages.
Much the same result is expected in 1974 for wage earners as a group,
but there will be significant redistribution of income within the group.
A wage settlement imposed by the Government in March, under the Special
Powers Act, provided for an across-the-board increase in wages now, with
subsequent increases tied to the price index. The across-the-board
increase, together with a scheduled tax cut and higher benefits paid to
low-income groups, is expected to increase the real disposable income
of low-income groups by about 3-4 per cent, with corresponding declines
in the real disposable income of high-income groups.
In Japan, the spring wage round in the manufacturing sector
concluded with the largest wage settlement negotiated in the immediate
post-war period -an increase of 30 per cent. This compared with a
rise of 20 per cent in the 1973 wage round and average rises of 16 per
cent in the period 1968-72. The 1973 wage increase, despite accelerating
price advances, was sufficient to allow real wages to grow by 10-1/2
per cent in 1973 over 1972, the same rate at which they had grown a year
earlier. However, early in 1974 the oil price increases, combined with
further price rises for raw materials, added sharp upward impetus to the
already high inflation rates. Thus, consumer prices in the first quarter
of 1974 alone rose by 10 per cent over the preceding quarter. Conse-
quently, real wages began to fall and in February were more than 5 per

III -26
cent below the preceding year's level. Thus, the 30 per cent wage
increase negotiated for fiscal 1974 may, by the end of the period,
prove sufficient only to restore the real income level that prevailed
at the end of 1973 plus some rather small -by Japanese standards-
increased beyond that.
Although Japanese industry appeared relatively satisfied with
the wage bargain, primarily because it avoided inclusion of escalator
clauses, rising wage costs will be a major factor in the inflationary
climate in Japan in 1974, in particular because productivity increases
are likely to be very small. In Japan, changes in productivity are
rather more heavily influenced by the cycle than elsewhere because
traditionally low rates of activity are not reflected in unemployment
to the extent that they are elsewhere. Thus, with employment growing
at a more or less steady 1 per cent per annum, increases in output
largely reflect productivity increases. Thus, in 1973 productivity rose
by over 20 per cent with output rising 17.4 per cent. However, at times
of sluggish output growth, productivity rates tend to fall to about 3
or 4 per cent, clearly adding to pressure on profit margins. This sort
of development is clearly indicated for 1974.
In Canada, real average hourly earnings in manufacturing rose
much more slowly in 1973 than they did in the previousfive years. A
substantial part of the explanation for this lies in higher labor force
participation rates (in this case, for young people and adult women).

III -27
Higher participation rates tend, for a time, to pull down the growth
of total labor productivity. Another result of high participation rates
has been to increase the proportion of part-time work, thus slowing the
average increase in labor income per employed worker.
Labor's share of total income in 1973 did fall, from the
exceptionally high shares of 1971 and 1972. But the fall was much less
than the data on average real earnings would suggest, because of the
rapid rise in the employed labor force.
