Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Real GNP in the second quarter apparently is averaging close
to the first-quarter level, while the rate of price advance, although
still large, is not quite as rapid as in the first quarter. No strong
expansive force has as yet emerged.
Industrial production is now estimated to have risen 0.4 per
cent in May, the second consecutive monthly gain. Moreover, the index
levels for March and April have been revised up. In May output of
business equipment increased appreciably further and there were
advances for autos and for nondurable consumer goods. Overall pro-
duction of materials was unchanged. The May index was 0.5 per cent
above the first quarter average.
The unemployment rate rose to 5.2 per cent in May, as the
civilian labor force rose sharply, after changing little since early
in the year. The increase in unemployment was concentrated among
younger workers. Unemployment declined for adult men, although weekly
initial claims for unemployment insurance tended up during the month.
Nonfarm payroll employment increased substantially in May, but manu-
facturing employment changed little. The workweek in manufacturing
recovered most of the sharp April decline--which was apparently
attributable to the occurrence of Good Friday in the reporting week.
Consumer spending remains sluggish, particularly after adjust-
ment for price increases. The dollar volume of sales increased
moderately in May, according to the advance report, but the rise

I -2
indicated earlier for April was revised down substantially, to show
virtually no change from March. Unit sales of domestic-type autos
remained at the somewhat improved April level, but sales of imported
cars declined further--for the fifth consecutive month.
Prospective expenditures for plant and equipment have been
reduced slightly, according to the latest Commerce survey. The planned
increase in total outlays for 1974 is now 12.2 per cent rather than
the 13.0 per cent indicated by the previous survey. The downward
revision is concentrated in the second half of the year. New orders
for nondefense capital goods rose sharply in April, even after allowance
for price increases, but the trend of new orders since last fall has
been comparatively flat.
The increase in wage rates has accelerated further, although
the sharp advance for May did include some special factors, such as
the initial effects of the May 1 minimum wage increase. In May, the
adjusted hourly earnings index for private nonfarm workers was 7.7 per
cent above a year earlier.
Prices of farm products declined in May for the third con-
secutive month, and were about 7 per cent above a year earlier.
Especially sharp reductions have occurred in prices of meat animals.
The wholesale price index for May is not yet available, but prices of
industrial commodities probably rose substantially further. In April,
the consumer price index had risen 0.6 per cent, with the marked slowing
from the rate of the preceding three months mainly attributable to a
decline in food prices.

I -3
Outlook. Staff projections through mid-1975 incorporate the
following policy assumptions: (1) Growth in M1 is assumed to average
an annual rate of about 5-1/2 per cent over the last three quarters of
1974 and to be somewhat more rapid thereafter. Nominal GNP is pro-
jected to increase more rapidly than M1, and short-term interest rates
are expected to rise somewhat above current levels later this year.
(2) The staff has eliminated the assumption of downward adjustment in
personal tax withholding schedules because the Administration is no
longer pushing such a measure. (3) An expanded public employment
program is still assumed. (4) It is now assumed that an oil tax
effective July 1, will be enacted along the lines of the measure
reported out by the House Ways and Means Committee, and that about $1
billion ($2 billion annual rate) would be collected during the second
half of 1:7A,. (5) Although other Federal expenditures remain close
to the Budget for fiscal 1975, the full employment surplus is increased
by assumptions (2) and (4).
Growth in real GNP in the second half of 1974 is now projected
at an annual rate of about 1-3/4 per cent, about 1 per cent less than
projected four weeks ago. The projected growth in disposable income
has also been reduced by dropping the assumption that withholding
schedules would be liberalized. The rise in consumer spending has
been scaled down in view both of the slower expansion of disposable
income and the continued sluggishness recently in retail sales.

I -4
Sales of new cars--both domestic models and imports--have been weak
and sales are expected to improve only moderately from current levels,
given the large recent increases in car prices, and the additional
substantial rise in prospect for the 1975 models.
The projected increase in business fixed investment also has
been reduced for the second half of 1974, in line with the recent
Commerce survey. The revision is more marked in real than in nominal
terms, in view of prospective price developments. It is still antici-
pated that housing starts will rise moderately and then level off.
Growth is expected to slow for both exports and imports of goods and
services, but with some net worsening in the balance.
In the first half of 1975, the rate of growth in real GNP is
now projected to be at an annual rate of only 1.6 per cent, compared
to the 2-1/4 per cent rate indicated four weeks ago. In real terms,
both consumer spending and business fixed investment are expected to
increase more slowly than had been projected last month.
Prices seem likely to rise even more rapidly in the second
half of this year than expected earlier, and the staff has raised the
projected increase in the GNP fixed-weighted index by about 1/2 per cent
in the last two quarters. In the fourth quarter, this index is pro-
jected to rise at an annual rate of around 7 per cent. Recent price
increases have been exceptionally large and further sizable advances
have already been announced in such important industries as steel and
autos. The recent acceleration in wage rates also suggests additional
pressures on the cost side. Nevertheless, the staff still expects

I -5
a slowing in the rate of price increase over the entire projection
period, with the fixed-weighted index rising at an annual rate of
under 5-1/2 per cent in the second quarter of 1975. The anticipated
moderation of the rise of foods and petroleum products is a major
factor in the projected overall slowing.
As a result of the slower growth in output, nonfarm employ-
ment is projected to increase by about a quarter of a million over the
next four quarters, compared to an increase of half a million projected
last time. As a result, the unemployment rate is now expected to rise
to 6.3 per cent by mid-1975, with the slower growth in employment partly
offset by a smaller projected growth in the labor force.

Industrial production. Industrial production rose 0.4 per
cent in May, slightly more than in April. The March and April indexes
were both revised upwards by 0.2 per cent. Output of consumer goods
and business equipment increased further in May and production of
materials was unchanged.
Auto assemblies rose 2.6 per cent further in May and were at
an annual rate of 7.7 million units. June production schedules indicate
an increase to an 8.1 million unit rate. Output of home goods and non-
durable consumer goods rose further in May. Production of business
equipment rose 0.8 per cent further as output of industrial equipment
showed a large increase. Overall production of materials was unchanged
as a small rise in durable goods materials was offset by a decline in
output of nondurable goods materials. (Confidential until release
June 14 p.m.)
Retail sales. The Census Bureau reports that sales in May
were 1 per cent above April and 2.5 per cent above the first quarter
average; in real terms there was probably little, if any, increase.
Excluding autos and nonconsumption items, sales in May were up by
2.0 per cent from the first quarter average. In the last few months,
sales of durable goods have recovered somewhat from the substantial
losses of the previous two quarters, and in May were 4.6 per cent
above the first quarter average. The increase in sales of nondurable
goods, on the other hand, has been slower; in May such sales were only
1.5 per cent above the first quarter.

I -11
The second quarter projection of consumer outlays for goods
has been lowered to reflect the unusually large $450 million downward
revision in the advance estimate of April retail sales and the relatively
small May advance. Downward revisions in the more complete sample
count for April were mainly in the automotive and general merchandise
categories. Total sales in April and May are currently estimated to
be 6.7 per cent and 6.4 per cent, respectively, above year-earlier levels.

Unit sales of consumer durables. Sales of new domestic
type autos in May were at a 7.8 million unit annual rate, the same
as in April but 23 per cent below a year earlier. Small cars sold at
a 2.5 million unit rate, slightly below April and 17 per cent below
May 1973. Large car sales were at a 5.3 million unit rate, up slightly
from a month earlier but one-fourth less than a year earlier. Small
cars accounted for 32 per cent of domestic-type sales in May, about
the same as in April; a year earlier, the percentage was 30 per cent.
Stocks of domestic-type new cars declined slightly in
May to the equivalent of a 57 days supply, There was a 58 days supply
in April and a 55 days supply in May 1973.
Preliminary estimates indicate that foreign car sales were
at a 1,2 million unit annual rate in May, somewhat lower than a month
earlier and down 30 per cent from December 1973. The import share
of total auto sales was only 14 per cent, well below the 17 per cent
reached in December 1973.
Estimates of unit factory sales of major home appliances,
TV's, and radios in May were 5 per cent above April but 4 per cent below
May 1974.

Conference Board survey of consumer attitudes and buying plans.
Consumer attitudes about the economy recovered substantially in the
March-April survey from their very depressed state at the beginning of
the year. But the composite index of purchase plans for autos, homes,
and appliances continued its year-long decline and in the latest survey
reached the low of the 1970 recession. It thus seems unlikely that
there soon will be a significant rise in discretionary purchases.
Fewer families planned to purchase major appliances and buyingplans
for autos and homes remained around the unfavorable levels of the
last two or three surveys.
Most of the improvement in attitudes reflected expectations
that income and business and employment conditions in the next six

I -14
months would be better than they are now. However, responses to
these questions remained more pessimistic than in the survey taken
prior to the energy crisis, and the more favorable expectations
represent a comparison with the period of energy shortages.

Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 4.9 per cent in April (p), following a 1.2 per cent drop in
March. The gain in April was widespread with nonelectrical machinery
the only major industry showing a decline. Nondefense capital goods
increased strongly, by 5.0 per cent, following a 2.4 per cent drop in
March. (The advance, partial-sample indication of a 0.7 per cent decline
in April nondefense capital goods orders was due, in part, to a clerical
error at the Census Bureau.)
Shipments of durable goods were up 1.1 per cent in April and
unfilled orders grew by 2.5 per cent.
Census is revising the shipments and orders data in the air-
craft, missiles and parts industry, which will affect total durables
and the capital goods series back to 1970. Revisions for months before
February 1974 have not been completed, hence the quarterly data in this
table are based on unrevised data.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturing and trade inven-
tories increased at a $26 billion annual rate in April (p), following a
$34 billion rise in March. A $23 billion, annual rate, rise in manu-
facturing stocks in April occurred mainly in durable goods, particularly
machinery, primary and fabricated metals, and motor vehicles and parts.
By stage of processing, the pickup was most noticeable in work-in-process
inventories; stocks of finished goods rose at about one quarter the
March rate. Wholesale trade inventories increased at a $3 billion rate
in April as a decline in farm products inventories partially offset an
$8 billion rise in motor vehicle and parts stocks. Retail trade inven-
tories were unchanged in April from March as a $3.8 billion, annual
rate, decline in auto stocks offset gains elsewhere.
For the first quarter as a whole, book value of manufacturing
and trade inventories rose at a $37 billion annual rate, the same as
in the fourth quarter. The amount of this book value increase that
carries through into the GNP accounts will be less, however, because of
a larger price adjustment.

Cyclical indicators. The Census composite index of leading
indicators fell 0.7 per cent in April (p)--the first drop since December.
The Boston FRB deflated leading index (with no trend adjustment) was
off 2.0 per cent; the Census deflated coincident index rose after four
straight months of decline.
Of the eight leading series available for April, those increas-
ing were industrial materials prices, the ratio of price to unit labor
cost, initial claims for unemployment insurance (inverted), new orders
for durable goods, and contracts and orders for plant and equipment. The
average workweek in manufacturing, common stock prices, and private
building permits all declined.

Of the leading indicators available for May, the average work-
week in manufacturing rose but common stock prices declined.
Construction and real estate. New construction outlays, in
both current and constant dollars, were essentially unchanged in May
from the upward revised April total. Current dollar outlays for private
residential construction edged up, but remained 18 per cent below their
February 1973 peak. Private nonresidential expenditures, which rose
only slightly, were at a new peak in May in both current and constant
dollars. The more irregular series for public construction expenditures
declined.
Based on available information from F.W. Dodge, indications
are that the rate of nonresidential construction activity will not be
sustained. So far this year contract awards for commercial and indus-
trial construction--which account for nearly half of total nonresidential
outlays--have been running below a year earlier in both current dollars

extrapolations. In no case
and real terms. In fact, contracts awarded during the first quarter of
1974 for commercial and industrial floor space were a sixth below the
peak in the third quarter of 1973. Contract awards increased somewhat
in April. Although some further strength is indicated for industrial
plants in the period ahead, these comprise about a third of nonresi-
dential outlays.
New home prices rose further during the first quarter of 1974,
after adjustment for changes in the mix of units sold. The price index
of new single-family homes sold, which also reflects changes in lot
value, increased 2 per cent after a somewhat smaller rise during the
fourth quarter of 1973. Year-over-year, the first quarter index was
up about a tenth, compared with increases of 8 and 6 per cent in 1973
and 1972, respectively.

I -20
Anticipated plant and equipment spending. The latest Commerce
survey of plant and equipment expenditures--taken in late April and
early May--shows business planning a 12.2 per cent increase for 1974,
down slightly from the 13.0 per cent indicated in the previous survey.
This reduction of planned spending is concentrated in the second half
of the year, with cutbacks by public utilities, communications, and
mining accounting for most of the change. The fixed capital outlays of
manufacturing industries are still expected to increase by close to 20
per cent in 1974. The nondurables grouping, sparked by a further upward
revision in petroleum, continues to plan larger increases than durable
goods producers. Within durables, primary metals producers revised
plans upward and motor vehicles and air transportation equipment revised
plans downward.
In the first quarter, total outlays for plant and equipment
were about the same as had been indicated in the February survey--the
first time since 1970-II, in which current quarter anticipations have
not been greater than actual expenditures. Anticipations for the
second quarter now indicate more strength than in the previous survey.
For the second half of the year, however, an increase of only 5.2
per cent over the first half is now indicated; this is a smaller rise
than the 7.2 per cent reported in the previous survey and less than the
6.5 per cent increase now indicated for the first half of the year, with
the growth in manufacturing slowing sharply.

I -21
Newly approved capital appropriations of large manufacturing
companies, as reported by the Conference Board, edged off (down 0.6
per cent) in the first quarter--the first decline since 1971-II.
However, backlogs of unspent appropriations continued to climb and could
support the current level of capital spending in manufacturing for over
four and a half quarters.

Labor market. The labor force rose sharply in May and the
increase exceeded the gain in employment; as a result, the unemployment
rate rose by .2 percentage points. The labor force advance was con-
centrated among adult men and teenagers following three months of little
or no growth--but while the teenage unemployment rate rose, joblessness
among adult males declined, reversing the upward trend of recent months.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance have been rising since mid-May
(except for Memorial day week), however, suggesting that the improved
situation for experienced workers may only be temporary.

Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 180,000 in May, somewhat
more than in April. These payroll employment gains followed a sluggish
period associated with the winter gasoline shortages, but the recent
rate of increase is substantially less than during 1973. Although employ-
ment advances have continued in the public sector and in services and

I -24
trade, manufacturing employment has shown little strength since last
fall and in May was still 170,000 below the recent peak in November.
Employment in the volatile construction industry has also been weak--
declining in May for the third consecutive month to a level more than
100,000 below February. The factory workweek rebounded in May from the
unusually low April figure (reflecting the fact Good Friday was in the
survey week) and at 40.3 hours was just slightly below the March level.

Earnings. The increase in the average hourly earnings index
for private nonfarm production workers accelerated further in May, with
the increase since January at an 8.6 per cent annual rate. Part of the
rise in May probably reflected the introduction of a large cost-of-
living increase in steel as well as the first effects of the May 1
minimum wage boost and the official end of controls on April 30. But

I -25
the widespread nature of the speed-ups--particularly in manufacturing--
suggests that the consumer price increases of late 1973 and thus far in
1974 are increasingly being reflected in wage adjustments throughout the
private sector.

Recent price developments. Farm prices have declined for the
three months ending in May to a level only about 7 per cent above a
year earlier, according to the Department of Agriculture. Although
crop prices are still almost one-third above a year earlier, meat
animal prices are down 18 per cent, poultry and eggs 14 per cent. The
large drop in meat animal prices has resulted in some declines to
consumers in recent months. Largely because of a 4 per cent drop in
meat prices, consumer prices for all food declined in April for the
first time since last September.
Retail food prices may have changed little in May, although
meat prices apparently dropped further as slaughter continued very
heavy. The number of cattle in feedlots has continued to decline,
however, so that shorter supplies of animals for slaughter may cause
a temporary rise in meat prices later this year.
Fuel price increases have also tapered off and were less
important in April and May than in the preceding six months. For
example, gasoline and motor oil at retail rose between March and
April at only about a third the rate that they had in the December-March
period; at the wholesale level, prices of petroleum products apparently
dropped in April and again by mid-May. (Revised indexes for refined
petroleum products are being released this week by the BLS.)
A slower rise in food and fuel prices is expected to have a
moderating effect on general price measures in the second half of the
year. From April 1973 to April of this year, food prices rose 16 per
cent, gasoline and motor oil prices 40 per cent, and fuel oil and coal
over 60 per cent. If these costs had increased at the same pace as

I -27
other items, the rise in consumer prices would have been about 6 per
cent instead of 10 per cent.

Another favorable development has been a drop in spot prices of
sensitive industrial materials since early April. Spot prices of textiles
and fibers have been declining since December of last year when cotton
prices peaked out, and hides and rubber prices have also dropped.
Metals prices have been strong, but recently copper and aluminum scrap
have declined. Steel scrap prices have risen in the last month, but
are still below early April highs. Further declines are expected, but
it seems unlikely that spot prices will fall the 30 per cent that would
be necessary to bring them back to year-earlier levels--let alone the
more than 50 per cent necessary to regain their 1971 average.

I -28
Unfortunately, the limited reduction in volatile raw materials
prices is not having a measurable impact on the upward thrust in
producers' prices of major processed materials. Large increases in
producers' prices of steel, copper, aluminum, paper products, chemicals
and plastics are now taking place. The increase in prices of industrial
commodities--which has been at an annual rate of about 30 per cent in
the seven months ending in April--indicates a protracted period of
inflation for both consumer and producer finished goods.
Apart from food and energy, consumer prices for goods and
services continued to rise in April at rapid rates similar to those in
February and March. In addition to the prospects for continued sharp
advance in nonfood commodities, a faster rate of rise for medical
services and rents, in the services component, may lie ahead.

Agriculture. Prices received by farmers fell 4 per cent during
the month ending May 15, to a level only 7 per cent above a year earlier.
Prices of livestock, grains, and cotton all contributed to the decline
but the lower crop prices, which have now firmed, are still well above
levels of a year ago. After further declines in early June, cattle and
hog prices were at the lowest levels in two years.

I -30
Downward pressure on livestock prices has resulted mainly
from record meat production in the U. S. (based on preliminary May
estimates) as slaughter of hogs, cattle, and poultry each advanced to
near all-time highs. Hog slaughter was 7 per cent above April and was
the largest in almost three years.
Stocks of meat in cold storage on April 30 were one-half
greater than a year ago, partly resulting from larger imports of
frozen beef. Japan and Western European countries have begun limiting
meat imports in order to protect their domestic producers. Larger
foreign meat supplies have consequently entered the U. S. (20 per cent
more frozen beef in March 1974 than 1973), but here also pressure is
increasing to reimpose meat import quotas.
Excessive moisture has kept corn and soybean planting to
about the same pace as last year. On June 2, 83 per cent of corn was
planted compared to the average 90 per cent completion, and soybeans
were 39 per cent planted compared to 64 per cent average completion.
Only 15 per cent of soybeans had been planted in Illinois, the major
producer, compared to a three year average of 70 per cent completion
by June 2. Heavy rains continued during the following week.
Crop yields may fall below trend again this year because of
late planting and the reduced care it will be possible to give to
this year's much larger acreage. With world grain stocks low and
continued drought in South Asia and North Africa, grain prices may

I -31
remain quite high compared to levels in recent years. Resulting high
prices for feedstuffs may continue to hurt the U. S. livestock
industry.
The number of cattle on feed dropped 3 per cent in April,
seasonally adjusted, as marketings of fed cattle continued to exceed
new placements. The number of cattle on pastures has increased rapidly
because of recently large calf crops, and the slow rate of feedlot
placements. Pressure to move animals off grass will increase as
pastures deteriorate in the hot weather. But at present fed cattle
prices and high feed costs, feeder calf prices may fall much further
before feedlot operators resume a normal rate of calf placement. The
losses which have severely hurt feeding operations may begin to affect
cow-calf operations also.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Financial and nonfinancial business borrowing remained large
in May in both long- and short-term markets. In contrast to April,
there were only a few postponements of bond issues, and public bond
offerings were the largest in over three years. The total increase in
short-term credit remained substantial, although below the exceptional
April pace and with less of the increase occurring at banks. With
lenders emphasizing investment quality, prime borrowers found the cost
of financing in the commercial paper market attractive relative to bank
borrowing and outstanding commercial paper rose after declining the pre-
vious two months. As these borrowers shifted out of banks, non-prime
borrowers appear to have stepped up their bank credit demands as they
found market borrowing increasingly difficult and expensive.
Market interest rates generally are currently slightly lower
than at the time of the last FOMC meeting. Most rate series are based
on high-quality financial instruments, however, and consequently do not
reflect the rising yields on lower quality securities that developed
over the past month. Home mortgage rates edged up only a little further
in the past few weeks, as stabilization of market rates and announce-
ment of Administration measures to support housing eased mortgage market
pressures.
Thrift institution inflows slowed further in May, as did the
rate of growth of commercial bank time deposits in denominations of
less than $100,000, and S&L's continued to borrow heavily at the FHL
Banks. FNMA secondary market support declined, particularly after

II -2
mid-May, as forward credit demands were diverted to the FHLMC, the FHLBB,
and the GNMA by the recently announced Administration subsidy programs.
Commercial banks had no difficulty continuing to raise large
sums in the negotiable CD market, although there were reports of
regional banks having to pay somewhat higher rates. Euro-dollar inflows
to U.S. banks--as well as to U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks--
were also large as banks here took advantage of the continued inflows of
Arab-owned dollars to the call-Euro-dollar market. However, in contrast
to April, U.S. bank lending to foreigners was apparently quite small in
May.
Outlook. Market expectations are in an unusually sensitive
state at this time, influenced in part by public statements of some
bankers that interest rates may have peaked. Recent declines in the
prime rate by a few banks provided support for this view. In addition,
concern about the liquidity and solvency of individual large financial
institutions is thought by some market observers to limit the Federal
Reserve's flexibility to tighten policy further. On the other hand, the
continued tautness in the money market has acted to brake downward expec-
tational movements in interest rates.
Abstracting from policy actions, the fundamental supply and
demand factors in financial markets are unlikely to cause significant
movements in interest rates in the near-term. Although seasonal tax-
related borrowing is likely to be substantial in mid-June, U.S. financial
markets are also expected to be benefiting from dollar inflows from both
the Euro-dollar market and short-term dollar investments by foreign

II -3
official accounts, as well as the large volume of maturing tax bills at
mid-month.
However, between mid-year and fall, total financing demands
are expected to increase, placing renewed upward pressures on market
interest rates. The combined Treasury and agency net financing needs
for the third quarter are likely to be much more than seasonal (almost
$12 billion), with over half related to housing support activities. At
the same time, State and local bond offerings will likely remain large,
with pollution control and public utility support issues an important
portion of the supply of new issues.
Moreover, with capital needs of corporations projected to re-
main large in nominal terms, there is no reason to anticipate a signifi-
cant slowing in business credit demands over the summer. But even if a
slowing in business financing demands should occur, it is likely that
long-term rates will be under upward pressure in the period ahead. In
the corporate market, the cost of short-term finance is now 1-1/2 to 2-1/4
per cent higher than long-term finance and this kind of rate relationship
has continued for several months now. Borrowers therefore may increasingly
shift their financing demands to intermediate and long-term markets,
particularly should expectations of declining short rates become less
widely held.
Particularly with continued slack inflows to thrift institutions,
upward rate pressures in long markets should extend to the mortgage market,
although state usury ceilings and the new Federal subsidy programs should

II -4
tend to moderate upward rate movements on home mortgages. However,
with 8-3/4 per cent FHA/VA mortgages currently selling at discounts of
5 or more points in the secondary market, another upward adjustment
seems likely in the administratively-determined contract rate on these
loans.
Monetary aggregates. In May rates of growth of all the
monetary aggregates continued to decelerate. Not only did the narrow
money stock grow less rapidly, but both commercial banks and thrift in-
stitutions were less successful in attracting small denomination interest-
bearing deposits, contributing importantly to the moderation of growth
in M2 and M3. Moreover, staff estimates based on partial data suggest
that all of the growth in time deposits other than CD's--the commercial
bank component of M2 and M3--was accounted for by large denomination
time deposits. As shown in the table, staff estimates suggest that in
both April and May outstanding commercial bank time and savings deposits
in denominations of less than $100,000 were unchanged or declined.
With small deposit inflows weak and loan demand still large,
banks continued to seek large denomination certificates of deposit and
nondeposit sources of funds. Sales of CD's slowed somewhat from the
April pace, but to date there is no evidence of any bank, other than
Franklin National, having difficulties in issuing negotiable CD's.
Those banks that have shown runoffs in such deposits have been contacted
by the Reserve Banks, and in no case has the reason for the runoff been
an inability to sell CD's. Aggregate sales of CD's have been strong in
New York as well as outside New York, and every District has reported

relatively large sales of CD's in May. Moreover, the average maturity
of CD's sold did not decline as reported in the press, but was the
same as in April, 2.0 months (preliminary), and longer than the maturity
of CD's sold in the first quarter. There have been scattered reports,
however, that some banks located outside money centers were paying CD
rates above those offered by major money center banks.
Nondeposit sources of funds increased in May by $1.2 billion,
reflecting mainly the persistence of a relatively low call deposit rate
on deposits flowing from oil-exporting countries into the Euro-dollar
market. In addition, banks sold loans to their affiliates, which the
latter financed in the commercial paper market.
Bank credit. Total loans and investments of all commercial
banks (last-Wednesday-of-the-month series, seasonally adjusted) slowed
in May, mostly due to a reduction in business loan growth.¹ The compo-
sition of business loan expansion changed as the growth rate moderated.
In March and April, bank borrowing by nonfinancial firms was broadly
based by industry and appeared to represent both prime and nonprime
borrowers. In May, however, as market sentiment toward commercial paper
changed drastically, the lowest quality issuers could not roll over
their maturing issues. Rate spreads among differently rated issues
have widened considerably, but financing was very attractive in the
commercial paper market for prime corporate borrowers. With the rate on
short-term prime paper declining, the differential between the bank
prime rate and the rate on short-term, dealer- placed commercial paper
reached over 100 basis points by the end of the month.

in an appendix to the Greenbook.

Consequently, prime nonfinancial borrowers shifted from bank credit to
the commercial paper market, and other borrowers were forced to use
their back-up credit lines at banks.
Among business loan categories at banks, public utility
borrowing was particularly large, reflecting cash flow problems arising
from the lagged adjustment of rate schedules to increased costs and con-
commitant difficulties in both the money and capital markets. Cost
overruns are increasing the financing needs of the construction industry,QI

and there are large inventories of unsold residences that must be
financed. There is evidence from a survey by District Banks that
commercial banks are extending more than seasonal credit to these firms
until conditions improve. In addition, energy firms borrowed heavily
at New York banks to finance oil lease payments in May. Together, these
three industries accounted for virtually all the loan expansion at
large commercial banks in May. Loans to foreign commercial businesses
did not maintain the pace of April growth, and loans to foreign commercial
banks and official institutions also moderated.
Despite the shifts of borrowers between markets, the total
increase in short-term nonfinancial business credit, as measured by the
change of business loans at banks plus dealer-placed commercial paper,
remained at the high first-quarter rate. The pace of short-term borrow-
ing by business has been high since the beginning of the year and re-
flects both enlarged working capital needs and rising book value of inven-
tory accumulation. Also, as newly available estimates from the Department
of Commerce show, there was a reduced level of corporate profits in the
first quarter after adjustment for inventory profits.

The very large April-May growth of bank loans to nonbank
financial institutions was due to lending to thrift institutions in New
York, California, and Arizona, and to other nonbank financial inter-
mediaries, particularly real estate investment trusts and nonprime
finance companies. However, prime finance and commercial credit companies
were able to sell commercial paper at rates well below the bank loan
rate, and as a result May was the first month since January that the
volume of outstanding directly-placed (monthly finance company) paper
rose. Thus, although lenders in the commercial paper market became
increasingly selective in May, the volume of issues of both nonfinancial
and financial businesses grew substantially. High quality bank affiliates
also sold paper, and total commercial paper outstanding rose $1.3 billion.

Nonbank financial intermediaries. According to sample data,
the deterioration of deposit flows into nonbank thrift institutions
continued during May. At S&Ls, savings flows weakened as the month
progressed, with the intra-monthly pattern of net flows estimated to
have been $300, $100, and -$100 million during the successive 10-day
periods. Although the actual deposit losses at mutual savings banks
were substantially less than in April, the seasonally adjusted deposit
performance at MSBs remained quite poor. Most recently, however, a
sample of New York MSBs reported a small net increase in deposits
during the first week of June, although the deposit experience at
individual banks varied considerably.

are available, the most popular accounts appear to be the 1 to 2-1/2-year
6.50 per cent certificate, and the 4-year 7.50 per cent certificate.
A new phenomenon, the payment order of withdrawal (POW) account,
surfaced at some of the New York MSBs recently. Thus far, 7 MSBs have
offered this account--which resembles a checking account in nearly all
respects--but early reports of its acceptance have been inconclusive.
Two large MSBs reported moderate activity in these accounts, but another
savings bank indicated that many of its POW accounts were opened by
employees. A system to monitor activity in these accounts is being
developed and data should be available later this month.
The net increase in FHLB advances was approximately $800
million during May, down from $1 billion in April. About half of this
increase was attributable to advances taken down under last fall's
8-1/2 per cent special commitment program, leaving approximately $1.1
billion of such commitments outstanding at the end of May. The new
program of subsidized advances, whereby S&Ls pay a rate 50 basis points
below the rate paid on debt issued to finance these advances, became
operational in early June. Allocations of $500 million per month are
to be made available under this subsidized program. To finance the
projected demand for regular advances as well as borrowings under the
two special programs, the FHLB System has offered $1.5 billion of debt
in June--which represents a break from their pattern of issuing debt on
a quarterly basis in the mid-month of a quarter. In addition, the
System is issuing $100 million of short-term discount notes per week,
and the District Home Loan Banks are actively seeking funds for use in
their interlending network by offering rates on member deposits that
are competitive with rates on alternative investments.

II -15
Long-term securities markets. Corporate and municipal yields
are still at about the same level as at the time of the last meeting,
although Government bonds are about 10 to 15 basis points lower. The
near-record level of rates in the corporate market has been sustained
by continuing concern over inflation, and a heavy supply of new issues.
Recently publicized difficulties of utilities and some financial insti-
tutions, Moody's actions down-rating bond and commercial paper issuers,
and their announcement that they are "reexamining all money-sensitive
industries" have heightened investors preferences for quality. Bank
demands for municipals--although reportedly still weak--have improved
somewhat recently, and individual interest in all bond markets remains
strong.
Stock prices fell below their 1973 lows in the latter half
of May, and then rallied in early June. Although the Dow-Jones
Industrials, which include many stocks with high dividend yields, are
at about the same level as at the time of the last meeting, other more
broadly based indices have not fared as well. The recent recovery seems
to have been prompted by widening belief that the prime rate and other
interest rates have peaked.
The total volume of corporate security offerings expected to
be marketed in June is quite large, reflecting continued new additions
to the calendar and a slackening of postponements and cancellations.
Public bond volume has been especially strong, and the forecasted
volume of $2.6 billion in June is the largest since March 1971. The
market decline in May prompted a large number of postponements of
scheduled stock offerings, some of which are expected to appear in June
and July. While there were only a few postponements of scheduled bond

offerings in May, and corporate capital spending plansrremain quite strong,
some utilities have announced cancellations or stretch-outs of plans for
expansion at the time of postponing financing. The volume of private place-
ments has declined in recent months, perhaps in response to increased policy
loans of life insurance companies and their cautious commitment behavior es-
pecially with respect to lower quality issuers.

Based on current schedules, the volume of municipal offerings
is expected to be about $2 billion per month in June and July, although
two recent developments could increase supply pressures in this market
in the near future. The State of New York has agreed to have the
State power authority buy and complete two unfinished generating plants
of Consolidated Edison and thereby provide the company with additional
working capital. The financing, which is awaiting the completion of an
engineering audit that will take two to three months, should be between
$500 and $800 million. Also, the State has recently empowered New York
City to set up a special Stabilization Reserve Corporation to issue
long-term bonds. The City is currently up against a debt ceiling for
general obligation bonds, and the Corporation will be used to help
alleviate its problem of financing large operating deficits with
short-term notes.

Consumer credit. The net increase in consumer credit outstanding
totaled $18.0 billion in April, seasonally adjusted annual rate, the
largest increase since last November. All major categories of credit
expanded more rapidly in April than in the first quarter, but with the
exception of home improvement loans and noninstalment credit, rates of
growth remained well below earlier highs.

The faster rate of growth in instalment debt during April re-
sulted from a larger volume of new credit extensions--with modest
increases in all types of credit--and a slight reduction in the rate
of repayments. Repayments had advanced to new highs in each month
of the first quarter.
Recent developments in rate and nonrate terms on consumer loans
indicate a less favorable climate for potential borrowers. Finance
rates on new car loans, which had edged down in recent months at both
commercial banks and finance companies, leveled off in April. In more
recent weeks, a number of banks in major cities throughout the country
have raised new-car loan rates from 50 to 150 basis points. Prior to
the increases, rates at these banks had been somewhat below the average
for all banks surveyed in April--10.51 per cent, annual percentage
rate. At finance companies, rates on new-car contracts purchased
from dealers averaged 12.28 per cent in April, down 14 basis points
from the peak in December but 40 basis points above the year-earlier
level. Nonrate loan terms at finance companies, as measured by an
index based on downpayment requirements and contract maturities,
tightened in the first quarter to the most restrictive stance
since the third quarter of 1972.
Finance rates on personal loans, which have been relatively
stable at both banks and finance companies in recent months, have also
been adjusted by a number of commercial banks since early May. In
general, rates on small, short-term loans were increased about 150
basis points while rates on larger, long-term loans--36 months and
over--were either reduced or left unchanged. In April, before the

adjustments, the most common rate for 12-month personal loans at commer-
cial banks averaged 13.00 per cent, annual percentage rate, down 1 basis
point from the first quarter average and 3 basis points below the peak
in the last year's fourth quarter.
There is additional evidence that consumers are encountering
difficulty in making repayments on existing indebtedness. Personal
bankruptcies are estimated to have increased in the first quarter to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 172,000 filings, up 9 per cent from
the full-year 1973 average, and 11 per cent above the fourth quarter
rate. Also, a year-end survey by a large bank of its finance company
customers indicated that the proportion of loans delinquent 60 days or
more at consumer finance companies rose to 3.59 per cent, an increase
of 22 basis points from 1971 and 1972 levels, but still below the
3.91 per cent rate at the end of 1970. The delinquency rate at sales
finance companies, however, was well above the preceding 2 years and
16 basis points higher than the 1970 figure.

II -22
Short-term interest rates. At the time of the May FOMC meeting,
short-term interest rates were receding from the high levels reached in
early May, and they edged down somewhat further in the days immediately
following the meeting. More recently, however, they have fluctuated in
a fairly narrow range, and at present most rates are about 5 to 20
basis points below levels prevailing at the last meeting.
The recent relative stability in rates reflects, in part, the
development of a market view that the stance of monetary policy will
not change significantly over the near term. Market hopes for a
near-term decline in yields have been dampened by the persistence of
the Federal funds rate around the 11-1/2 per cent level and by recent
statements of Board members that have made clear the System's deter-
mination to resist inflation. At the same time, however, fears among
market professionals that the System might tighten further have faded
somewhat, as recent data have shown some slowing in price increases and
in the growth of the monetary aggregates. Moreover, some professionals
have concluded that the System cannot tighten significantly further
without running the risk of a financial crisis.
In private markets, rates have remained fairly stable despite
continued strong short-term credit demands. The pressures generated by
these demands, however, may not be fully reflected by the rates shown
in the table, which are primarily rates on prime quality debt instru-
ments. Many investors reportedly have developed a strong preference
for top quality instruments, in the wake of the difficulties encountered
by Franklin National Bank and other institutions. As a result, the

II -23
yield spread between medium grade and high-grade dealer-placed commer-
cial paper, for example, widened to as much as 150 basis points at the
end of May, and very few sales of the lowest grade paper are even
taking place.
In the Treasury bill market, rates have continued to be
unusually low compared with those on other instruments. In addition
to the increased investor preference for quality, the persistence of
this wide spread reflects foreign central bank bill purchases, which
have been quite large since February and reached $1.4 billion (net)
in May. Noncompetitive tenders in weekly bill auctions have also
continued to be unusually large--around $600 to $700 million each
week since the May FOMC meeting. Against this background of strong
demands, bills have remained in relatively short supply, with dealer
positions at exceptionally low levels. In early June, the Treasury
raised only $800 million of new cash through a bill strip, whereas
the market had expected a $1 to $2 billion offering. Moreover, the
already limited market supply of bills will be accentuated later this
month by the redemption of $4.5 billion of outstanding TAB's.
The bill strip, auctioned on May 30, was needed primarily
to cover the low point in the Treasury's cash balance just prior to
the mid-June tax payment date. It consisted of $100 million additions
to each of eight outstanding bill series--maturing between September 19
and November 17--and has been readily absorbed by the market.
Looking ahead, the Treasury may not return to the market for
financing until late July, When about $3.0 billion of new money will be
needed. Federal Agency borrowing in July--as in June--is projected to be

II -24
quite heavy, amounting to about $2.8 billion. In the third quarter
as a whole, it still appears that combined Treasury and Agency borrowing
may amount to nearly $12 billion, compared with only about $6.0 billion
for the same period in both 1972 and 1973.

Mortgage market. The mortgage markets tightened further
during the past month. Interest rates in both the primary and secondary
mortgage markets continued upward to new-highs in early June. Tenta-
tive indications are that seasonally-adjusted new mortgage commitments
at savings and loan associations declined somwhat during May, after
7 months of gradual recovery from last fall's low. Over the past few
weeks, S&L's reported funds in short supply in virtually all of the
12 FHLBank districts.
Contract interest rates on new commitments for 80 per cent
conventional home loans at selected S&L's edged higher through June 7
to a level of 9.06 per cent--21 basis points above the peak in
September 1973. However, returns on such loans, after adjustment
for servicing costs, continued below yields on new issues of high-
grade utility bonds. Nonrate loan terms tightened somewhat last month,
with the proportion of S&L's offering 90 per cent 25-year financing
for new-home purchase dropping to 69 per cent in early May--down from
this year's high of 73 per cent in April and well below the high of
85 per cent in January 1973.
The further recent increase in home mortgage yields has
carried average contract interest rates on conventional loans above
the usury ceilings of 9 per cent or less which prevail in 16 States

II -26
and the District of Columbia.1/ In addition, approximately a dozen
states--including California and Florida--have usury ceilings of 15
per cent or less that are applicable to corporate as well as to in-
dividual borrowers. Such ceilings may now be affecting yields on both
new and outstanding construction loans, on which rates are often
pegged 2 to 5 percentage points above the prime rate.

and VA-guaranteed loans in 13 States. Regardless of usury ceiling
limits, national banks may currently lend at rates of up to 9 per

centage point above the discount rate on 90-day commercial paper
in effect at the district Federal Reserve Bank.

II -27
Offerings in the June 3 FNMA auctions of forward commitments
to purchase FHA/VA loans and high loan-to-value ratio conventional
home mortgages declined substantially from the volume posted in the
last several auctions, and average yields on accepted bids rose
moderately to new record levels. Also, negotiated purchases of FNMA's
one-year standby commitments, which had been quite heavy in March and
April, dropped to quite low levels after the first week in May.
The slackened pace of FNMA's secondary market support has
reflected not only the reduced demand for new mortgage credit generally
but also the impact of the recently-announced Administration subsidy
measures which have diverted credit demands to other federal agencies.
For example, under the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation's new
program which became effective May 20, more than $1.5 billion in commit-
ments were issued through June 7 to purchase 8-3/4 per cent conventional
new-home mortgages. In addition, the FHLBanks have reportedly been
receiving applications for the new subsidized advances well in excess
of the $500 million to be made available each month. Under its Tandem
Plan, GNMA since the beginning of May has issued commitments to purchase
below market-rate FHA/Va mortgages on about 38 thousand units--two fifths
of all commitments issued since the plan began in late January. 1/
1/ The January 22 plan providing for GNMA purchase of 200,000 new-unit
FHA/VA mortgages bearing a contract interest rate of 7-3/4 per cent
is still in effect. The plan announced May 10 provides for purchase
of an additional 100,000 mortgages with contract rates of 8 per cent.

Delinquency rates on home mortgages (Mortgage Bankers Associ-
ation series) edged up in the first quarter, after seasonal adjustment,
to 4.36 per cent of outstanding loans held by reporting institutions--
a new high for the series which covers more than two decades. The
foreclosure rate, however, remained about the same as that shown
throughout last year, as 0.25 per cent of outstanding home mortgage
loans were placed in foreclosure. Delinquency and foreclosure rates
continued to be particularly high on FHA-insured loans--especially
those associated with the Sec. 235 interest-rate subsidy programs
which were suspended early in 1973.
Agricultural finance. As livestock prices have moved downward
since August 1973, financial losses have been experienced by the cattle-
feeding industry. Last summer and early fall, feeders paid extremely
high prices for feeder cattle, in the expectation that beef prices
would rise further after removal of price controls in September.
Feeders also held animals past normal slaughter weights, first in
anticipation of still higher prices and subsequently in hopes of a
reversal in the downward price trend that ensued. As prices fell,
feeders lost money on the initial weight they had purchased as well as
on the weight put on during feeding.
Primary lenders for cattle feeding operations--banks and
production credit associations (PCA's)--confirm that their borrowers
have suffered financial losses. Lenders surveyed in late May reported

II -30
that some nonfarm investors have lost their entire cattle equity, and
that some farmer-borrowers have mortgaged land to repay cattle loans.
However, each lender reported that most loans are being repaid, so that
loan losses are small. The lenders believe that the period of greatest
losses has passed, because the sale of cattle purchased at last year's
peak prices is largely completed.
Farm Credit System data through April indicate that farm
borrowing increased at roughly last year's pace.

Several Federal Land Banks raised their rates to 8 per cent on May 1,
with three-fourths now charging 8 per cent. PCA rates as of April 1
averaged 9.34 per cent, 163 basis points above a year earlier. At
large commercial banks, rates on both feeder cattle and farm production
loans in early April rose only slightly from March, thus remaining
roughly at the level first reached in September 1973.

II -31
Federal finance. On May 30, the Administration released the
Mid-Session Review of the 1975 Budget showing the same budget estimates
released earlier for the debt ceiling hearings (see May Greenbook).
At this point, our estimate of the Federal deficit for the current
fiscal year is nearly $1.0 billion less than the Administration's $3.5
billion figure, because of our lower expenditure assumptions. Experience
in recent years has shown, however, that there is an exceptional amount
of error in budget estimates for June, because the Administration has
fairly wide latitude in determining the June outlays figure and because
the heavy corporate tax payments made in June are difficult to forecast
accurately.
Our estimate of fiscal 1975 outlays has not changed signifi-
cantly since the last Greenbook, but the legislative assumptions under-
lying our receipts projections have been changed. First, we have
dropped the assumption that Congress will reduce overwithholding, as
proposed by the Administration (the Administration no longer seeks
this action); thus, our estimate of receipts for fiscal year 1975 has
been increased by $4.0 billion. Second, our revenue estimates, as
well as the Administration's, now include the revenue impact of the
"Oil and Gas Energy Tax Act of 1974", which was recently reported
out by the House Ways and Means Committee. As a result of these
changes in legislative assumptions and partially offsetting changes
in income assumptions, we have increased our estimate of Federal

II -32
receipts to $296.0 billion in fiscal 1975,with the deficit reduced
from $13.0 billion to $8.0 billion.
Because of the large number of important tax and expenditure
bills pending in Congress, considerable uncertainty still pervades
projections of both Federal receipts and expenditures. On the outlays
side, Congress has not completed action on any of the regular appropri-
ations bills for the fiscal year beginning July 1. Receipts projections
are complicated by the large number of proposed tax measures--in
addition to the Energy Tax Act--on which some Congressional action is
due in the next few months. By the end of June, the Ways and Means
Committee expects to complete action on a general tax reform bill,
which may include some revision of the minimum tax on preference in-
come, and a change in the tax on capital gains. Meanwhile, in the
Senate, there are a number of proposals, generally involving floor
action, for cuts in personal income taxes and for increased taxes on
business in general and on the oil industry in particular.
Provisions of the Ways and Means Energy Tax Act mentioned
above, include: (1) a tax on windfall profits on oil production which
is largely rescinded if plowed back into development of domestic
sources of oil; (2) the phase-out, generally by 1977, of percentage
depletion for oil and unregulated natural gas; and (3) a number of
foreign income tax measures designed to reduce the tax advantage of
foreign production. The Ways and Means Committee estimates indicate
that annual revenues, derived from their proposed Energy Tax Act,

II -33
would be about $1.8 billion in the first full year, increasing to
about $3.4 billion in 1979. However, the outcome of this bill and
other tax measures is highly uncertain due to the expectation of an
unusual amount of floor action in the House and Senate.
Recently, the House passed a $19.3 billion increase in the
temporary debt ceiling to $495 billion, $10 billion less than requested
by the Administration. Thus far, the Senate has taken no action on
the temporary debt ceiling, which is due to expire on June 30 when the
ceiling reverts to its $400 billion permanently authorized level. It
should be noted, however, that the whole House and the Senate Banking
Committee, in separate legislation, recently approved renewal of
authority, which expired last October, for the Treasury to borrow up
to $5 billion directly from the Federal Reserve.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. After showing considerable weakness in
March and April, the overall U.S. payments position appeared to strengthen
somewhat in May. During the last half of May, the dollar appreciated by
about 1-1/2 percent, on average, against the major foreign currencies,
while the official settlements balance for the month was probably close
to zero. By contrast, during both April and March there were official
settlements deficits of about $1-1/2 billion (not seasonally adjusted,
not at an annual rate), and during each month the dollar depreciated by
about 2 percent, on average. Preliminary data indicate that the official
settlements balance in the first week of June was in substantial deficit --
over $1 billion -- mainly reflecting oil payments to Venezuela.
In April, the merchandise trade deficit decreased to $1-1/2
billion from $5-1/2 billion in March (annual rate) despite a steep rise
in the value of fuel imports. This rise was more than offset by a decline
in nonfuel imports and a sharp increase in nonagricultural exports,
neither of which is expected to continue at this rate. Bank-reported
net capital outflows continued to rise during the month of April, but
may have subsided or even been reversed in May.
The rise in the price of oil continues to transform the U.S.
balance of payments. The fuel import bill is now running at an annual
rate of more than $30 billion, a rate which may well be maintained through
the first half of 1975, provided prices remain fairly stable. A relatively small

III -2
part of the increase in the fuel import bill has been offset by a rise in
income receipts from the operations of U.S. oil companies abroad. Apart
from possible further changes in the value of oil imports or income receipts,
the balance on goods and services will probably deteriorate fairly steadily
through the second quarter of 1975, mainly because of an anticipated decline
in the prices of agricultural exports as supplies of these commodities
increase.
Some improvement in capital flows is still anticipated, but the
timing and magnitude of such changes remains highly uncertain. The
tightening in U.S. credit markets and the attractiveness of investment
opportunities in the United States are conducive to a reversal of the large
net capital outflows reported by U.S. banks in recent months, and we may
have begun to see the beginning of such a reversal in May.
Abroad, the impact of the higher oil prices has led to substantial
deteriorations in the trade and current account positions of the major
foreign industrial countries in the first few months of 1974, with two
exceptions: the German surpluses on trade and current account have increased,
and the Canadian current account position remains in rough balance. A number
of countries have borrowed heavily abroad to finance their growing current
account deficits and to support their exchange rates. The most critical
situation is the Italian, where official intervention in support of the
lira has taken place at the rate of $1 billion a month thus far this year,
and where the prospects of future borrowing in the private capital market
seem limited. Political differences over domestic economic policies led
to the fall of the Italian government this week.

III -3
Foreign exchange markets. The decline of the dollar's exchange
value, which had amounted to over 9 per cent (weighted average) since the
end of January, was halted in mid-May, and the dollar has subsequently
appreciated by about 2 per cent. The dollar's weighted average exchange
value is currently about 6 per cent higher than in October, 1973.
It is difficult to pinpoint exactly the reasons for the dollar's
turnaround. The immediate stimulus was the news report from Basle on May 14
that the Federal Reserve, the Bundesbank, and the Banque Nationale Suisse
were seriously considering concerted intervention to maintain orderly
exchange market conditions. In fact, there were no immediately subsequent
intervention purchases of dollars, but perhaps this report tended to change
market participants' expectations about the possibilities of the dollar
moving any lower. Later in the month the release of U.S. trade figures
for April, showing a swing back into surplus (Census basis) caught the
market by surprise and stimulated an increased demand for dollars. Also
a factor, probably, was the renewed commitment of Germany to its partici-
pation in the snake, disappointing market expectations of a German revaluation
or independent float. Late in May, with the dollar's rise on the basis
of the U.S. trade figures, the Bundesbank sold nearly $400 million, while
the System purchased a substantial amount of marks. In the following few
days a portion of this intervention was reversed, as speculation on a mark
revaluation again flared briefly. On June 11 the Bundesbank again purchased
dollars as the dollar spurted in reaction to developments in Italy.
The Italian lira remained under strong selling pressure in recent
weeks. The Bank of Italy sold some $900 million in May and by June 10 had

III -4
sold an additional $400 million. The lira dropped fairly sharply against
the dollar on June 10 on the news that the Italian government had fallen
(after less than three months in power) because of the inability of the
coalition to agree on policy measures to remedy Italy's acute economic and
financial difficulties.
Among other major currencies, the other mark bloc currencies --
the snake currencies and the Swiss franc -- moved roughly in line with
the mark against the dollar, while the French franc, sterling, and the yen,
have shown no great change against the dollar over the past few weeks. The
Canadian dollar turned easier on June 10 and 11 as U.S. firms reportedly
repatriated funds for corporate tax payments. The Bank of Canada sold roughly
U.S. $30 million to moderate the rate movement.
In the gold market prices have ranged between $153.50 and $165.50
over the past month, with prices currently at the low end of that range.
Market expectations of possible official sales (particularly by Italy) seem
to have dominated expectations that U.S. citizens may soon be allowed to
deal in gold.
Euro-dollar market. Over the past four weeks the overnight Euro-
dollar rate has declined slightly, and is now a bit lower in comparison
with the U.S. Federal funds rate. It averaged 11.19 per cent in the week
of June 12, and after adjustment for reserve requirements the effective
cost to U.S. banks was about 70 basis points above the Federal funds rate,
compared with about 85 points four weeks earlier. The 3-month Euro-dollar
deposit rate, averaging 11.63 per cent in the week of June 12, was likewise
slightly lower than four weeks earlier, but with the U.S. 60-89 day CD rate
also down a bit the rate differential is about the same.

U.S. banks' gross liabilities to their foreign branches continued
to increase through most of May, reaching an average of $3.7 billion in the
week of May 22 compared with about $2 billion in mid-March. The increase
in liabilities was strongly encouraged by massive inflows of Arab-owned
dollars into call deposits with U.S. bank branches in London. Rates paid
on Arab-owned call Euro-dollars have reportedly been below both the over-
night rate and the call rate received by other depositors. In the past
three weeks, however, liabilities to branches have declined quite sharply
to $3.0 billion in the seven days ending June 7.
In the London interbank market, more tiers have emerged in the
rate structure as lenders have become more conscious of the quality of
borrowers or have run up against country exposure limits. Some sources say
U.S. regional banks now pay 1/8 or 1/4 per cent over the quoted interbank
offer rate, while Italian and Japanese banks pay premiums ranging from 1/8
to 3/8 per cent.
Relationships between the cost of short-term Euro-dollar loans
and short-term borrowing costs in the United States have shown somewhat diverse
movements in recent weeks. From May 3 to June 7 the 90-119 day commercial
paper rate moved down, both absolutely and by close to a full percentage
point in relation to short-term Euro-dollar loan rates. But, as shown in
the accompanying table, the increase in U.S. bank loan costs has approximately
paralleled the rise in the 3-month Euro-dollar loan rate.
The amount of publicized new credits arranged in the market for
longer-term Euro-currency bank loans declined to $2.2 billion in May, according
to World Bank initial estimates which show a $4.5 billion average monthly

III -7
rate in the first quarter and $2.7 billion for April. In May, loans of $100
million or more were arranged by the Kingdom of Denmark ($300 million), the
Irish Republic ($250 million), Yugoslavia ($216 million, for a nuclear power
project), the National Bank of Hungary, Petroleos Mexicanos, and the Mexican
Federal Electricity Commission ($100 million each). Negotiations for a $200
million loan to the Italian Railways have been delayed by the Italian govern-
ment crisis.

III -8
U.S. balance of payments. According to preliminary data, the
U.S. official settlements balance was in approximate balance in May (not
seasonally adjusted) following deficits of $1-1/2 billion in both March
and April. In addition, the average foreign currency value of the dollar
began to appreciate after mid-May, following a fairly steady depreciation
since January. The balance swung back to a substantial deficit of $1.4
billion in the week of June 5, as foreign official holdings rose because
of very large oil payments to Venezuela.
Some basis for the improvement in May can be seen in preliminary
data on bank reported capital flows. U.S. bank liabilities to foreign
branches rose by $2 billion in May, more than double the average increase
in March-April. Almost all of the May increase, however, was accounted for
by a large end-of-week inflow on the last day of the month, which was
reversed early in June. There may also have been a net inflow in May of
private capital through agencies and branches of foreign banks, and a drop
in the (gross) outflow of funds attributed to U.S. bank claims on foreigners.
Available information for April shows that the trade deficit
narrowed substantially -- from $0.5 billion in March to $0.1 billion
(seasonally adjusted, not at an annual rate) in April. The improvement in
the trade balance was more than offset by an increased deficit on the
capital account. Bank reported claims on foreigners rose by $1.5 billion
(not seasonally adjusted) in April, including an unusually large $0.6
billion jump in long-term claims. Of the total, claims by U.S. banks

III -9
increased by $2.0 billion (nearly all for their own account), while claims
by U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks declined by $0.5 billion.
Meanwhile, bank liquid liabilities to private foreigners rose by $1/4 billion
in April. On balance, banks reported a net outflow of $1-1/2 billion in
April, twice the outflow in February and March combined. However, the
April increase is considerably overstated because March, as in the case of
May, ended with a large temporary end-of-week inflow of $2 billion.

The substantial net outflow of liquid and nonliquid bank funds
that took place between February and April reflected heavy dollar borrowing
by foreigners -- both directly from U.S. banks and indirectly through
foreign branches -- to meet their rising oil import bills. This outflow

III -10
also reflected the dismantling of U.S. capital controls on outflows of
bank funds at the end of January, as well as the easing of foreign controls
over capital inflows.
Security transactions in April were about in balance, with foreign
purchases of U.S. bonds of about $200 million offsetting U.S. purchases of
foreign bonds, mostly Canadian. The first foreign issue subject to the
Interest Equalization Tax to be floated in the New York market since
the tax rate was set at zero in January appeared in April, and amounted
to $41 million.
U.S. foreign trade. In April the U.S. trade balance (balance
of payments basis) was again in deficit -- $1.4 billion at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate. This compares with a revised March deficit rate of
$5.5 billion. The smaller deficit in April occurred as imports increased
by only 2 percent while exports showed an unusually strong (7 percent)
increase. However, for March-April combined, compared with January-
February, exports increased by less than 7 percent while imports increased
by nearly 15 percent, resulting in a downward swing in the trade balance
of about $6-1/2 billion (annual rate) between the two periods. (See table below)
By area, about half of this $6-1/2 billion deterioration was
accounted for by a reduction in our trade surplus with EC(9) countries,
particularly with Germany. The other half of the decline can be attributed
to an increasing deficit with the developing countries, primarily the oil
producing countries of Venezuela and Nigeria.

The major factor contributing to the worsening of the balance has
been, and will continue to be, the fuel import bill. In April, fuel imports
amounted to $30 billion (annual rate) compared to a $15 billion rate just
four months earlier in January. Most of the increase, has come about because
of price rises. The average price of imported oil in April was $11.67 per
barrel compared to $7.11 per barrel in January. The Arab oil embargo
affected the volume of imports throughout the period. In April, oil imports
rose to a rate of 6.7 million barrels per day (they were 6.0 million b/d
in January) and this rise only partly reflected the effects of the lifting
of the embargo in March. The volume of imported oil is expected to increase
further in the coming months as imports from Saudi Arabia return to more
normal levels.
Aside from fuels, there were also significant changes in other
commodity categories. Nonagricultural exports showed considerable strength,

III -12
particularly in April. Part of the increase was due to higher export prices,
but an equally important part was due to an increased volume of shipments.
Price rises (particularly for fertilizer) contributed to the strong increase
in chemicals exports and to the strength in nonferrous metals exports.
Increased volumes were particularly apparent in exports of machinery,
automotive products to countries other than Canada, and steel mill products.
Export orders for durable goods continued to rise in April and the backlog
of unfilled orders was still high, giving rise to expectations of continued
strength in U.S. exports of these commodities in the coming months.
Agricultural exports increased by more than 8 percent from January-
February to March-April but most of the increase was due to higher prices.
By April, however, export prices of most major agricultural commodities
appear to have leveled off or turned down slightly and the value of
agricultural exports in April was the same as in March.
The value of nonfuel imports increased in March-April from the
rate of the previous two months in spite of a sharp decline in April. The
growth in the volume of these imports as a whole continues to be relatively
weak. Moderate volume increases were the primary cause of increases in
the value of imports of foreign cars, capital goods, and food (mostly coffee).
Higher import prices were more important for increases in steel, other metals,
and consumer goods imports. Foreign car sales in the United. States continue to
be very sluggish; in May such sales averaged 1.2 million units (annual
rate) compared to sales of 1.8 million units in 1973. Projections of

III -13
foreign car sales for the rest of 1974 have been revised downward to an
annual rate of about 1-1/4 million units. Since foreign cars were still
being imported at over a 2 million unit rate in April, the volume of imports
may be cut sharply in the second half of the year, particularly if stocks
are adjusted to the estimated level of sales.

III -14
Balance of payments of major industrial countries. Early
estimates -- such as those by the Secretariat of the OECD and the
IMF -- of the effects of the oil-price increases on the payments
positions of the OECD countries indicated that there would be a de-
terioration of the combined OECD current account of about $45 billion
in 1974. This would result in an aggregate current account deficit
(defined to include official transfers) of about $40 billion. The
trade statistics for the first few months of this year confirm that
a substantial worsening of the trade and current balance is, in fact,
taking place for the major industrial countries, with the exceptions
of Germany and Canada.
Authorities in some countries appear to be expecting their
own current account positions to turn out better than is forecast by
the OECD Secretariat or the IMF; the basis for the relatively favorable
outlook is, in some cases, a planned export promotion drive, or, in
other cases, merely a different assessment of the situation. Indeed,
in the United Kingdom, and perhaps in other countries, reliance is
being placed on the growth of net exports to help stimulate domestic
recovery. It is not clear, however, that these national forecasts are
consistent. Some part of the higher growth of net exports in one
country will come at the expense of another OECD country. Attempts to
reduce a deficit by increasing exports to the non-oil LDCs are also
likely to be frustrated in the aggregate because the impact of the oil-
price increase on the balance of payments of the non-oil LDCs will

probably necessitate a reduction in their imports from the OECD
countries. Finally, since the capacity of the oil-exporting countries
to absorb imports is believed to be limited, one country's success in
reducing its deficit by increasing its exports to the oil-producing
countries implies that another's will tend to increase. Thus, the
aggregate OECD deficit cannot be significantly reduced and some countries'
expectations about increases in net exports will not materialize.
When the oil-price increases occurred, some countries were
in relatively strong payments positions, notably Germany and the
United States, and others, in particular Italy and the United Kingdom,
were in relatively weak positions. A movement by the latter towards
balance would require that other countries allow their current accounts
to deteriorate by more than the amount implied by the oil-price increase.
There is little evidence that such equilibrating movements have begun
to take place in two most extreme cases of Italy and Germany: the
underlying Italian situation may well have worsened, while the under-
lying German position has markedly strengthened. On the other hand,
the British non-oil current account seems to be moving in the desired
direction.
Changes in exchange rates or demand management policies that
might bring about the desired current account adjustments do not seem
to be occuring on the required scale. Some changes in effective exchange
rates have taken place, and the appreciation of the DM and depreciation

III -17
of the lira are in the direction that the non-oil deficits would
indicate. But demand management policy has been mostly concerned with
the internal objective of reducing the rate of inflation and not
primarily with balance of payments goals, except in the Italian case.
There is no general understanding that demand management should be
co-ordinated so that countries in relatively strong external positions
should deflate less and the weaker deflate more. In particular, German
monetary policy currently appears to be among the most restrictive in
industrial countries.
Most of the impact of the oil-price increases has been absorbed
by external financing, and very large amounts of borrowing, or decreases
in net lending, have already taken place this year. The greater part
of this financing has been in the Euro-currency market. This financing
-- not all of which related to the oil crisis -- has sometimes been in
response to official encouragement or requests, as in the United Kingdom,
Italy and France, or to changes in regulations on capital flows, as in
Japan and again in France. Because of the large shifts in net borrowing
that have taken place this year, the official reserves of some of the
countries that have experienced a large deterioration in their current
account positions have not declined commensurately. As long as such
large-scale financing is feasible, adjustment can be postponed, but
for some countries the limits on continued borrowing in private capital
markets may soon be reached.

III -18
The German balance of payments continues to show exceptional
strength. In 1973 the trade balance surplus reached a record $15.4
billion and the current account surplus was $4.8 billion. For 1974 the
trade surplus was originally forecast by the Bundesbank early this year
at $5-1/2-7-1/2 billion. However, the cumulative trade surplus for
January-April has already reached $6.7 billion and the current account
surplus for the first four months was $3.7 billion.
The surplus on current account grew in 1973 despite the sub-
stantial cumulative revaluation of the DM, and this year despite the
greatly increased cost of oil. The continued strength of German exports
is not fully understood. German industry seems to have been operating
at lower levels of capacity utilization than foreign competitors, giving
German exporters a delivery time advantage and offsetting the increasing
foreign-currency price of exports. Mark revaluations may have created
anticipations of future revaluations and led to speculative buying,
although it is not clear that this factor could have been important
after the revaluations of the first half of the year. An additional
factor is the strong rise in German exports to Eastern Europe in 1973.
Also contributing to the trade surplus was a slowing down of
imports in 1973. For the early part of the year this was attributed to
a speculative drawing down of inventories of imported goods and anticipation
of further DM revaluations. For the latter half of 1973 and early 1974,
the slower growth of domestic activity was reflected in a smaller than
normal increase in import demand.

III -19
The usual German deficit on services and transfers rose last
year because of the stimulus to German tourism from the DM revaluation
and an increase in foreign worker remittances due to the strong rise in
domestic earnings; however, in November 1973 further recruitment of foreign
workers was suspended and it is expected that up to 100,000-workers (4
per cent of the total) will return home in 1974, tending to reduce re-
mittances and strengthening the German current account still further.
Although the original forecasts for the German trade and current
account surplus in 1974 already seem to be far too low, the surplus
for the entire year may well be lower than that indicated by the present
rate. New foreign orders grew sharply during January-March, but re-
ports for April indicate a leveling off. Also, domestic activity is
expected to pick up in the second half of the year, increasing import
demand. On the other hand, Germany's trading partners will not be
operating at full capacity this year, tending to offset Germany's previous
advantages in merchandise deliveries.
Despite stringent measures to discourage capital inflows,
the German capital account was heavily in surplus in 1973. Because the
inflows were reversed in the latter half of last year and early this year,
the capital control measures were greatly liberalized this February.
Recently capital flows may have again reversed themselves.
Italy's balance of payments, which had deteriorated sharply
in 1973, has, under the impact of the oil-price increases, become

III -20
extremely grave this year. In 1973, the current account, which normally
is in surplus, went into a deficit of about $2 billion. The causes were
the sharp deterioration of Italy's terms of trade due to the rise in the
world price of raw materials and foodstuffs, and the strong economic up-
swing which led to a large increase in imports of food and industrial
materials. Capital outflows, motivated in part by lack of confidence in
the Italian economic and political situation, weakened the external
position further. A substantial part of these outflows shows up as an
increase in the current account deficit, because of overinvoicing of
imports, underinvoicing of exports, and lower recorded receipts from
tourism and emigrant remittances due to the purchase abroad of exported
Italian banknotes. The official settlements deficit, adjusted for about
$4.4 billion of compensatory Euro-currency borrowing, was about $4.8
billion in 1973.
The oil-price impact was expected to add about $5-6 billion to
the current account deficit this year. Preliminary trade data for the
first four months indicate that this pessimistic forecast is being borne
out. The overall deficit is larger because of heavy capital outflows.
To prevent a further lira depreciation, the Bank of Italy has
intervened at the rate of $1 billion a month this year. In order to
finance the intervention Italy has been forced to borrow heavily. It
has arranged the following official credits: $1.87 billion from the
European Monetary Cooperation Fund (3 months, renewable once--which

III -21
the EMCF may roll over into a one-year loan) all of which has been drawn;
a standby credit of $1.2 billion from the IMF (not yet drawn); and
$4 billion in swaps from central banks (also not drawn). In addition,
state corporations have been directed to borrow in the Euro-currency
market and have raised $2.3 billion so far this year which the Bank of
Italy has drawn on. The interest costs of this borrowing have been
rising to what may be unacceptable levels, and the Italians may decide
no longer to tap this market. Italy's foreign exchange holdings are
nearly exhausted, and the amount of unused medium- or long-term credit
that is available is manifestly inadequate to finance the deficit.
The Italian authorities have reacted to the balance of payments
crisis partly by tightening credit, and partly by restrictions on capital
outflows and trade. In May they imposed an import deposit measure
requiring importers of specified goods to deposit for 6 months 25 or
50 per cent of the value of imports in a non-interest bearing account
at the Bank of Italy. The measure is intended to absorb liquidity as
well as reduce imports. However, the gravity of the crisis will require
further measures to be taken.
After an effective depreciation of about 15 per cent from
January 1973 to February 1974,. the lira has not been allowed to depre-
ciate further, because the authorities apparently believe that the
present rate is now at a proper level and that further depreciation will
be inflationary.

III -22
The United Kingdom's trade balance deteriorated steadily and
sharply from 1972 through 1974-Q1; the current balance has also worsened
steadily and sharply, from approximately zero in 1972 to a deficit at
an annual rate of about $10 billion in 1974-Q1. In April the trade
balance -- and consequently the current balance -- showed what is hoped
to be a significant reversal of the downward trend. Exports rose
sharply, both because of an assumed increase in export unit values
and continued growth of export volume.
Much of the very sharp increase in the trade deficit since
1973-Q3 is attributable to the higher cost of petroleum imports. The
non-oil current account balance began to improve in January and it is
widely expected that the deficit will decline and be eliminated
by the end of 1974, as export volume increases strongly and the terms
of trade improve somewhat further.
A major share of the burden of financing the current account
deficit has fallen on the nationalized industries and local authorities
who have borrowed almost $1.5 billion this year and about $4 billion
since official encouragement of such borrowing began in March 1973. As
a result of this, official reserves have increased almost $1 billion
over the past year, despite sizeable deficits on current and private
capital accounts.
In France, the trade balance showed a surplus of about $1.4
billion in 1973, and the current account a deficit of nearly $150 million.

III -23
For the first four months of 1974 the trade deficit was $1.1 billion.
This substantial deterioration occurred despite strong export growth
over the last year. Export orders continue to be high, but export
growth will be adversely affected by the slowdown of activity in most
of France's major trading partners.
The French have begun an export promotion program directed towards
oil-producing countries with large populations, non-oil LDC's which
are producers of other raw materials, and East European countries. The
French, perhaps unrealistically, hope to bring their trade account into
balance by end-1975.
The French have responded to the oil-price impact on their
external position by leaving the EEC snake and allowing the franc to
float downward, and by increasing net capital inflows, through removal
of restrictions on long-term borrowing. The Treasury and public sector
enterprises have already negotiated loans of about $3 billion in the
Euro-currency market. As a result of this borrowing, official reserves
have remained unchanged.
Among the smaller industrial countries, Denmark, which uses
oil for 90 per cent of its energy supplies, has been particularly badly
hurt by the oil-price increases. The trade deficit for 1974-Q1 was
$700 million, almost double the level for the first quarter last year,
and the first quarter current account deficit of about $500 million was
$36 million greater than the current account deficit for all of 1973.

III -24
The current account deficit for 1974 is expected to be about
$1-1/2 billion. To help finance this deficit, the Danes have recently
activated about $50 million of a $150 million standby credit arranged
between the leading Danish commercial banks and a group of international
banks. The Danish Government has also adopted an extensive excise tax
measure to cut consumer spending and imports.
Japan's trade and current accounts worsened substantially in
1973, with the trade surplus declining from $9.0 billion in 1972 to
$3.7 billion, and current account from $6.6 billion to rough balance.
Mainly because of the increase in oil prices the deterioration in the
trade balance has continued into 1974, and the cumulative deficit for
January-April was $1.5 billion. The cumulative current account deficit
(not seasonally adjusted), was $4.1 billion for the same months.
The OECD has forecast a 1974 current account deficit of $7.5
billion. However, the Japanese authorities expect a much lower deficit,
primarily on the basis of a significantly slower growth of imports than
is forecast by the OECD.
Because of very large long-term capital outflows in 1973
($9.7 billion), the overall balance of payments showed a deficit of $10.1
billion last year. This year net long-term capital outflows have declined,
and the Japanese have increased their short-term foreign borrowing,
particularly in the Euro-dollar market. As a result of this reduction in
net capital outflows, the overall deficit for 1974-Q1 was only $4.2

III -25
billion despite the current account deficit (not seasonally adjusted)
of $3.3 billion.
Because of Canada's self-sufficiency in energy resources, the
current balance is likely to be affected only indirectly by the oil-
price increases. There is little reason to alter the OECD's pre-oil
crisis forecast of a current account deficit of about $1/2 billion,
unless there is a serious recession in the United States, which accounts
for 70 per cent of Canada's trade.

APPENDIX A
BANK CREDIT REVISION*
Seasonally adjusted bank credit data (last-Wednesday-of-the-
month series) have been revised for the period July 1973 through April
1974 on the basis of the December 31, 1973, Call Report data. These
revised data have been used in the current Greenbook tables.
According to the December Call Report data, growth in total
commercial bank credit was at a somewhat faster pace than the partially
estimated data had indicated. The annual rate of growth of total loans
and investments in the fourth quarter of 1973 had been estimated to be
4.4 per cent, but on the basis of Call data was changed to 6.3 per cent
(Table 1). In the first quarter of 1974, the growth rate for total
credit changed only nominally, rounding off at 16 per cent in both
cases. (All 1974 data are subject to further revision when the June
30, 1974, Call Report becomes available.)
The higher year-end credit level reflected larger holdings of
total loans and "other" securities (securities other than U.S. Treasury
issues) than had been estimated (Table 2). In each of the major
bank credit areas--total loans, U.S. Treasury securities, and other
securities--the ratio of nonmember to country member assets increased
between June and December, and thereby raised the basic monthly series
level by raising the assets of nonmembers. The upward revision of
total bank credit as of the year end was in part offset by a downward
revision for both members and nonmembers of U.S. Treasury security
holdings between the last Wednesday of December (December 26) and the
Call date (December 31). The previous estimate was based on the
typical increase of holdings of Treasury securities between these two
dates but this did not occur last year. There was a decline, in fact,
and the downward revision resulted in a considerably larger reduction
of Federal securities in bank portfolios in the fourth quarter than
had been estimated.
On the other hand, holdings of other securities were sub-
stantially larger on the December Call date than estimated. This was
due in part to a considerably stronger expansion in bank holdings of
these securities between December 26 and December 31 than had been
reflected in the "window dressing" estimate. Perhaps the unusually
rapid accumulation of these securities in the last five days of
December was related to the decline in holdings of U.S. Treasury
securities noted above.

Division of Research and Statistics.

Total loans were also higher on the December Call date than
estimates had indicated. In the fourth quarter, bank loans expanded
at an annual rate of 7.1 per cent compared with the estimate of 5.5
per cent. Loans were $2.9 billion higher on December 31 than
estimated, and about half of the shortfall of the previous estimate
was due to an overestimate of interbank loans which are deducted
from the level of total loans.
Real estate, agricultural, security, and nonbank financial
loans were all somewhat higher on the December Call date than had been
previously estimated, while business loans were lower. Differences in
the major loan items were relatively small,however. For example, real
estate loans increased at an annual rate of 15.9 per cent over the
fourth quarter of 1973 compared with an estimated 14.2 per cent, and
business loans increased 4.6 per cent compared with an estimated 5.1
per cent. Consumer loans--which are taken from Consumer Credit
Statistics--were not affected by the benchmark revision.
