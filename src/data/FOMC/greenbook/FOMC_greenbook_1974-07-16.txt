Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted 
passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act.           
 
   
 
    
 
                                                            
 
1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and 
tables were not reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The staff currently is estimating that real GNP changed
little--or possibly edged down--in the second quarter. There are no
present indications of an emergence of forces making for significant
economic expansion. Meanwhile, the upward momentum of nonfarm prices
continues very strong, and wage rates have been rising at an exception-
ally rapid rate in recent months. Productivity in the private non-
farm economy apparently declined further in the second quarter.
In June, industrial production is estimated to have changed
little, following two months of moderate increase. Auto assemblies
were maintained at the May rate, and highly tentative data suggest
that output of business equipment, steel, and some other major
materials was relatively stable. For the second quarter as a whole,
industrial output is estimated to have risen around 1/2 per cent from
the first quarter.
Conditions in the labor market in June were about unchanged.
The unemployment rate remained at 5.2 per cent, as the second con-
secutive increase in the civilian labor force was matched by a rise
in total employment (household series). However, nonfarm payroll
employment edged down, following two months of sizable increase. In
manufacturing, both employment and the workweek were lower in June.
For the second quarter as a whole, nonfarm payroll employment increased
by about 400,000.
Consumer spending has remained sluggish. Weekly data suggest
a slight decline in the dollar volume of retail sales in June,

I -2
following a moderate increase in May. Unit sales of autos, however,
edged up in June, with imports unchanged after several months of
decline. For the second quarter as a whole, the increase in retail
sales is estimated to have about matched the apparent rise in prices.
Both housing starts and residential building permits were
down sharply in May, and for the quarter as a whole, starts probably
were below the level of the two preceding quarters.
Manufacturers' new orders for durable goods rose sharply in
May, as they had in April, with primary metals especially strong.
Nondefense capital goods orders remained at the advanced April level.
The limited data now available on business inventories indicate a
large rise in book value in the second quarter. On a GNP basis--that
is, after adjustment for the increased value of stocks because of
higher prices--inventory investment apparently remained relatively low.
Wage rates increased at an exceptionally rapid rate in Hay
and June. For the second quarter as a whole, the adjusted hourly
earnings index for the nonfarm sector rose at an annual rate of about
9-1/2 per cent; in June, the index was about 8 per cent above a year
earlier.
From mid-May to mid-June, prices of farm products declined
for the fourth consecutive month. More recently, however, farm prices
have been rising, particularly for meat animals. The wholesale price
index for June is not yet available, but announced price increases

I-3
for steel, chemicals, autos and other commodities indicate that
industrial commodity prices probably advanced considerably further.
In May, the consumer price index had risen 1.1 per cent, with increases
widespread among commodities, including foods, and services. The
consumer index was almost 11 per cent above a year earlier.
Outlook. Staff projections through mid-1975 incorporate the
following monetary and fiscal policy assumptions. (1) Growth in M1
is assumed to average an annual rate of about 5-1/4 per cent in the
second half of 1974 and to be somewhat higher in the first half of 1975.
This would imply that short-term interest rates by the end of the
projection period would be somewhat above current advanced levels
unless GNP growth is weaker than we are projecting. (2) An expanded
public employment program is still assumed. (3) Other Federal
expenditures are assumed to remain close to the budget for fiscal 1975.
Real GNP is now projected to change little in the third
quarter and then to expand at a minimal pace to mid-1975. From the
second quarter of 1975 to the second quarter of 1975, real growth is
now projected to amount to less than 1 per cent, a slower rate than
expected four weeks ago.
The further downscaling of real growth reflects a weaker
housing outlook than appeared likely four weeks ago, a somewhat larger
projected decline in net exports and continued sluggishness in real
consumer purchases. Housing starts are now expected to remain at

I-4
the reduced second quarter rate in the last two quarters of 1974 and
to decline somewhat in the first half of 1975. These downward
revisions reflect greater weakness in multifamily starts than had
been anticipated, in part, because of increasing difficulties in
construction financing. The housing projection does not, however,
make allowance for any serious deterioration of savings inflows to
thrift institutions attributable to the spread of new competitive
market instruments.
Price prospects also appear bleaker than four weeks ago.
The price increase for industrial products has been larger and more
pervasive than anticipated, and increases for fuels, materials, and
intermediate products are likely to be passed on through later pro-
duction stages. Also important is the sharply accelerated pace of
increase in wage rates; the emerging pattern of wage increases and
the prospect of prices rising more rapidly has caused us to raise our
projections with respect to compensation per manhour and unit labor
costs. The increase in the GNP fixed-weight price index has been
raised by an average of about 3/4 per cent over the next four quarters.
In the fourth quarter of this year, this index is now projected to be
rising at an annual rate of almost 8 per cent, and in the spring of
next year at a 6 per cent rate.
With growth in real GNP now projected to average less than
1 per cent over the next four quarters, total employment is expected

I-5
to change relatively little rather than increasing as had been anticip-
ated four weeks ago. The unemployment rate is now projected to rise
to about 6-1/2 per cent by mid-1975, even though growth in the civilian
labor force is expected to be relatively slow.

Industrial production. Industrial production is tentatively
estimated to have changed little in June. If this estimate holds,
the second quarter average would be 0.4 per cent above the first
quarter level.
Auto assemblies in June, which had been scheduled at an 8.1
million annual rate were reduced by a strike at Ford and output
remained at the May level of 7.7 million units. Auto production
schedules for the third quarter have been revised upward to an 8.7
million rate, reflecting a decision to produce a larger number of
1974 models in July.
Estimates of output in the business equipment area and in
the electric power based sector of the total index based on pro-
duction worker manhours were both about unchanged in June.
Production of raw steel and of the chemical, textile,
and paper group apparently changed little.
(Note: The June production index will be ready for the Friday
supplement.)
Retail sales. Our estimate of retail sales for June based
on the weeks through June 29 suggests that sales were off about half a
per cent from May with little strength evident in any major categories.
More complete sample counts have raised earlier estimates of sales in
April and May; April is now 0.9 per cent above March and May is 0.7
per cent above April.

Unit sales of consumer durables. Sales of new domestic-type
autos in June were at an 8.0 million unit annual rate, slightly above
figures for April and May (revised upward because of changes in the
seasonal factors) but a fifth below a year earlier. Small car sales
were off 4 per cent from May, While large car sales were up by an
equal percentage. Small cars accounted for 30 per cent of domestic-
type sales in June, the same as a year earlier but well below the
recent high of 39 per cent in January.
Preliminary estimates indicate that foreign car sales were
at a 1.2 million unit rate in June, the same as in May but a third
below last June. Imports accounted for 13 per cent of total auto sales,
down from 16 per cent in June of last year.GAF

Stocks of domestic-type new cars declined further in June
to the equivalent of a 53 days supply, compared to a 57 days supply
at the end of May. The stock/sales ratio in June of last year was at
a 46 days supply.
Factory sales of major home appliances, TVs, and radios in
the first three weeks of June remained at the May level but were 4
per cent below June of last year. Sales of color TVs and radios were
up substantially from May.

Michigan Survey Research Center survey of consumer attitudes.
The Michigan index of consumer sentiment--a composite of five questions
on personal financial situations, business conditions, and whether it
is a good time to buy household durables--indicated less pessimism in
April and May than when the previous survey was taken in February,
at the height of the energy crisis. However, attitudes were still
somewhat less favorable than last fall and the index of these res-
ponses was notably lower than in past cyclical downturns.
The unusually low level of the index of consumer sentiment
both before and after the energy crisis appears to be the result of
intensified inflationary expectations and lack of confidence in
government economics policies. For some time, those survey respondents
who expected at least 10 per cent inflation and who think the govern-
ment will be unsucessful in dealing with economic problems also have
tended to have unfavorable attitudes toward personal financial
situations and business conditions.
At present, however, a willingness to buy ahead of expected
price increases may have loosened the relationship between the index
of sentiment and outlays for household durables. In other downturns
in consumer sentiment, large increases in pessimism about personal
financial situations and business conditions were associated with
marked deteriorations in the percentage of households who thought it
was a good time to buy household durables. In contrast to earlier

I -12
experience, the percentage of households who continue to think that
it is a good time to buy large household durable has declined rather
moderately over the last 18 months. In the April-May survey, more
respondents still said that it was a "good time" to buy large house-
hold durables (39 per cent) than said it was a "bad time" (22 per cent).
On the other hand, for over a year, consumers have not changed their
opinions that market conditions for autos or homes are unfavorable
because of high prices, high operating costs, and interest costs.
Manufacturers' orders and shipments. New orders for durable
goods rose 5.9 per cent in May (p), following a 5.1 per cent increase
in April. The gain in May was widespread with especially strong
advances in primary metals, machinery and aircraft. Nondefense capital
goods orders were virtually unchanged following a 5.5 per cent increase
in April. In real terms, durable goods orders rose 3.6 per cent in
May, but nondefense capital goods orders were off 2.2 per cent.
Shipments of durable goods were up 2.9 per cent in May and
unfilled orders increased by 3.7 per cent.

Inventories. Book value of manufacturing and wholesale
trade inventories increased at a $35 billion annual rate in May (p),
following a $23 billion rise in April. The $28 billion annual rate
of rise in manufacturing stocks in May occurred mainly in durable
goods, particularly nonelectrical machinery, blast furnaces and steel
mills and the non-auto components of transportation equipment. By
stage of processing, the acceleration in rate of increase was mainly
in materials and supplies. Wholesale trade inventories increased at
an $8 billion rate following a $1 billion decline in April.

Of the eight leading series available for May, those in-

for unemployment insurance (inverted), the average workweek in manu-
facturing, new orders for durable goods, and contracts and orders for
plant and equipment. Industrial materials prices, common stock prices,
and private building permits all declined.
Of the indicators currently available for June, the average
workweek declined but common stock prices improved a bit.

Construction and real estate. Seasonally adjusted value of
new construction put in place in June, at an annual rate of $135.7
billion, held at the May level. However, expenditures for private
residential building approached a new low for this year and were
almost a fifth below the peak in February 1973. Private nonresidential
outlays remained little changed from their recent high in March, and
outlays for public construction rose somewhat, but stayed below their
April peak. For the second quarter as a whole, total outlays averaged
only 1 per cent below the high reached in the third quarter of last
year.

Measured by the Census Bureau's composite index, construction
costs in recent months have continued more than a tenth above year
earlier levels. For the year 1973, such costs were up almost 9 per
cent from 1972.
With private housing starts down sharply in May and residential
building permits substantially reduced, it now appears that starts in
the second quarter as a whole may have dropped below the reduced rate
of the fourth quarter of 1973. As in the first quarter, the April-
May average for single-family starts showed some improvement. However,
starts of multifamily units dropped considerably further, owing to the
still very large volume of units under construction and the adverse
influence of increasingly higher costs for materials and construction
loans. Moreover, difficulties currently being experienced by the
REITs, which tend to specialize in interim financing for this sector,
have also been an inhibiting factor.
Labor market. There was little overall change in labor market
conditions during June. The unemployment rate remained at 5.2 per
cent, seasonally adjusted, and nonfarm payroll employment changed
relatively little. The factory workweek declined somewhat as overtime
hours were curtailed.
The unemployment rate has been on a plateau a little above
5 per cent since the beginning of the year, following a rise from
last October's low of 4.6 per cent. Unemployment among adult men and

I -18
blue-collar workers dipped in May, but their jobless rates returned
to previous levels in June, and unemployment among most other groups
remained about unchanged.

The civilian labor force and total employment rose by about
a quarter of a million in June, following an even larger increase in
May. The gains in the labor force were in sharp contrast to the
sideways movement shown during the January-April period. Since
January the adult female labor force has advanced at a rapid pace,
but this increase has been partially offset by declines among teen-
agers and adult men.
A small decline in nonfarm payroll employment in June
followed substantial gains in April and May. Manufacturing employ-
ment fell by 20,000, and the factory workweek shortened by 0.2
hours to 40.1 hours--a half hour less than a year ago. Construction

I -19
employment fell again in June, in part due to increased strike activity,
putting the total 150,000 below the February level. Employment in
services and State and local government--two sectors which have
generally been a source of employment strength throughout the recent
period--again showed considerable gains in June. Since November 1973,
nonfarm payroll employment has advanced at an annual rate of less than
one million, compared with 2.7 million over the four quarters of 1973.

Earnings. The average hourly earnings index for private
nonfarm production workers has been rising at an accelerated pace in
recent months. For the second quarter as a whole the nonfarm total
was up at a 9.6 per cent annual rate. Large earnings increases have
been occurring in most industries, with the fastest rates of rise in

I -20
manufacturing, trade and services. In the construction industry, the
earnings index has also been rising more rapidly, after a period of
moderate increases when wages were under control of the Construction
Industry Stabilization Committee.

Collective bargaining. A number of recent collective bar-
gaining settlements have provided large wage increases. The longshore-
men at North Atlantic seaports settled for a wage and fringe package
estimated to cost more than 33 per cent over-the-life of the three year
contract. Workers will receive a first year wage increase of nearly
15 per cent on October 1 and about 8-1/2 per cent in each of the next
two contract years. Prior to the settlement, the longshoremen had
received a 2,5 per cent pay raise on June 1 which restored the amount
that had been disapproved by the Pay Board in May 1973. The new con-
tract covers 25,000 workers and is expected to set the pattern for an
additional 10,000 dock workers at the South Atlantic and Gulf Ports
where contracts also expire September 30.
In other negotiations, the machinists and Northwest Airlines
reached agreement on a 26 month pact which provides first year wage
increases of about 7-1/2 per cent on top of a 3 per cent pay raise
retroactive to September 1, 1973. Second year pay raises will average
about 5 per cent. The cost-of-living formula was liberalized, but
retains a cap--l0 cents or about 1.3 per cent a year maximum in the
second and third contract years. The new agreement, which covers 3,000
workers, is identical to the recent United Airlines settlement and is
expected to be closely followed by TWA, National, Continental, and
Allegheny where negotiations are continuing.
The men's clothing workers settled on a three year agreement
which will give them pay raises of about 13 per cent in the first year
and about 7 per cent in each of the remaining contract years as well as
a cost-of-living escalator--the first in the clothing industry--which

I -22
will pay out a maximum of 10 cents an hour or 2.4 per cent in the
second and 15 cents or 3.3 per cent maximum in the third contract year.
Finally, the steel workers and seven other unions apparently
reached agreement with Anaconda Company on a new three year contract.
Although the terms have not yet been released, it is estimated that
the pact is very similar to the basic steel settlement negotiated
earlier in the spring. Bargaining is continuing with other major
nonferrous metal companies, affecting a total of 115,000 workers.

I -23
Recent wholesale price developments. Price developments in
recent weeks have been less encouraging than had been hoped. Prices of
farm products declined from February to mid-June (a sizeable May-June
drop will be reflected in the June WPI which will be released July 12
and reported in the Greenbook supplement, but in recent weeks prices of
foodstuffs have risen appreciably. Spot prices for corn, wheat, and
soybeans have all increased, reflecting uncertainty over crop yields
and high export demand. Prices of steers and hogs--particularly the
latter--have also moved up, although this could be a temporary develop-
ment resulting in part from a hold-back on marketings of meat animals.
Spot prices of industrial materials have for the most part
been firm except for such agriculturally-based raw materials as cotton,
hides, and rubber. Prices of copper scrap and aluminum scrap in some
areas nave dropped from peak spring (April-May) levels, but steel
scrap prices have rebounded to levels approaching earlier highs in
April. Recently, announcements have been made of further substantial
price increases for steel mill products, lead, and fabricated aluminum
products. Prices of chemicals also have been increased sharply.
In the finished goods category, announcements of higher prices
for motor vehicles have been prominent.
Consumer prices. Consumer prices rose at a 13 per cent
annual rate, seasonally adjusted, in May to a level nearly 11 per
cent above a year earlier. Food prices advanced appreciably following
their April decline. Increases in energy costs, although substantial,
were well below the peak first-quarter rates, but prices of other
nonfood items rose considerably faster than in earlier months this year.

for fresh fruits and vegetables. In June retail meat prices continued
to fall--according to USDA's chainstore sample data (preliminary, con-
fidential). Recent advances in livestock prices may have an impact on
subsequent months but are still expected to be temporary.

1/ From same quarter of 1973.
2/ April-May averages; May estimate preliminary, confidential.
The widening of farm-retail spreads has contributed very
importantly to the increase in retail food prices over the last year.
In the first quarter they were nearly 20 per cent, and in the second
quarter about 24 per cent (preliminary, confidential), above their levels
a year earlier. These estimated spreads--which reflect all nonfarm
costs (wages, packaging, etc.) as well as profit margins of processing
and distribution--accounted for about 55 per cent of the retail cost
of USDA's market basket of foods of U.S. farm origin in the first and
second quarters of 1973. Their increase thus contributed about half
of the 22 per cent rise in the market basket between the first quarter
of 1973 and the first quarter of 1974. Using second quarter data
(preliminary, confidential) the estimate would be about 13 out of 16
per cent.
Energy prices rose substantially further in May, as in April,
though much less than in the first quarter. The major impact on prices
is now coming from other commodities and from services which have
registered unusually large advances this year. In view of the recent
pace of price rise for consumer finished goods at wholesale, a quick

I -26
slowdown at retail appears unlikely. The April and May CPI increases
were also boosted by a sharp climb in used car prices--of nearly 20 per
cent in these two months following eight months of decline.

Agriculture. Production of red meat in June matched the
record high level in May as increased beef output offset a decline in
pork. Increased availability of meats was a major factor in the further
reduction of average farm prices of 6 per cent during the month ending
June 15. But prices have since turned sharply upward. On July 8,
hog and steer prices were 55 and 25 per cent higher, respectively,
than on June 15, while wheat, corn, and soybeans were about 15 per
cent higher.
The advance in livestock prices mainly has reflected recent
actions by Government and industry to increase demand. The Department
of Agriculture will purchase more meat for the school lunch program
and negotiations are under way to increase beef exports to Canada and
to restrain imports from Australia and New Zealand. Also, retailers
recently have promoted beef sales with specials and increased advertising.
The higher price level may be sustained during summer months by shorter
supplies of fed cattle.
Weather, on the other hand, has been the major factor in
higher crop prices. Rains have caused grain and soybean crops to be
planted later than usual and this may result in lower yields. Also,
erosion and flooding have damaged some areas where planting was finished.
Agricultural officials recently lowered the corn crop estimate from 6.7
to 6.4 billion bushels but the crop will likely be even smaller, though
substantially exceeding last year's large harvest of 5.5 million bushels.
Winter wheat harvest from Texas northward through Nebraska
is well along if not complete, but yields have been hurt by dry weather.

I -28
One well-known private analyst is now forecasting 12 per cent larger crop
than last year as opposed to a 21 per cent larger crop that earlier had
been predicted by agricultural officials.
The Department of Agriculture has raised its estimate of 1973
net farm income by $6 billion, to $32.2 billion. Crop receipts proved
to be about $4 billion higher than previously estimated, primarily
because sales of grain and soybeans stored from previous years had
been underestimated. Receipts from livestock were also revised upward
by about $1 billion, and the estimate of production expenses was lowered.
The Department's projection of net farm income for 1974
remains at $24 to $26 billion, but this now appears as a sharp drop
from the 1973 level.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SITUATION
Total credit flows to businesses continued relatively large
in June and early July. As money and credit markets came under
increasing pressure after mid-month, and investor quality preference
became more prevalent, market financing subsided and credit demands
accelerated at large New York and Chicago banks.
Most recently, yields on CD's and commercial paper rose about
75 basis points as the Federal funds rate increased to around 13-1/2
per cent and short-term credit demands intensified. In the commercial
paper market, spreads between prime and lower quality issues widened
and rumors have developed about the solvency of some issuers. In
early July some regional banks were said to be having difficulty placing
their acceptances or to issue CD's, but at this writing the staff has
been unable to confirm these reports. Treasury bills have not shared
in the general upward movement in yields as foreign official, Federal
Reserve, and private domestic demand remained large in the face of low
and often short dealer positions.
In capital markets, yields on corporate and municipal bonds
rose 30 to 50 basis points, and equity prices declined over 7 per cent--
reaching levels last seen in 1970. Postponements, cancellations, and
reductions of scheduled new issues were quite large in June, amounting
to $575 million of corporate bonds (mostly public utilities), almost
$250 million of stock, and $450 million of tax-exempt issues, Post-
ponements and cancellations have continued into July. Rising interest

II -2
costs were only one factor in these developments. Underwriters faced
some difficulty in forming syndicates and many issuers have been forced
to add more restrictive covenants to bond indentures (such as 10 year
no call provisions). Some corporations chose to offer intermediate-
term secutities as a way to tap a wider range of potential investors
and to obtain lower interest costs, but many also shifted their financ-
ing to banks. In the tax-exempt market, offerings of short-term obliga-
tions rose very sharply as borrowers found themselves blocked by bond
usury ceilings or sought to avoid locking themselves in at high
interest cost.
Although relatively weak in late May and early June, business
loan demands--particularly at New York City and Chicago banks--rose
sharply from mid-June to early July. Takedowns of commitments are
reported to reflect continued diversions of credit demands from borrowers
unable to finance in the commercial paper market, and financing originally
scheduled for the capital markets. With declining internal fund flows
and reduced liquidity, many large borrowers are also reported to be
drawing on their lines for the first time in years. In addition, for-
eign business loans in New York City and in San Francisco remained
large in June.
The pick-up in business loans in New York and Chicago after
mid-June was financed mainly in the CD and Euro-dollar market at rising
rates. Foreign official and foreign commercial banks appeared to be
large buyers of CD's, and, for the first time, the staff has reliable
reports that Arab oil proceeds are being invested directly in CD's

II -3
as well as Treasury issues. In April and May, foreign purchases of
Treasury securities apparently had not reflected direct Arab investment.
Seasonally adjusted nonbank thrift deposit inflows rose in
June from the depressed April-May level and the staff estimates that
small denomination time deposits at commercial banks rose after two
months of decline. However, available data for late June and early
July indicate that relatively large outflows from the thrift institutions
are occurring during the mid-year reinvestment period.
The average rate on mortgages in the primary market and secon-
dary markets rose moderately in recent weeks to new highs, and FHA/VA
ceiling rates were raised 1/4 percentage point to 9 per cent. New
residential mortgage commitments at thrift institutions declined in May
and probably in June as mortgage funds continued to be reported in short
supply throughout the country.
Outlook. Federal financing demands--including those of the
agencies--are expected to be large this summer. The Federal Financing
Bank may offer its first issue of $1 to $1-1/2 billion this month
and over the balance of the third quarter the Treasury and Federal
Financing Bank combined are expected to raise another $4-1/2 to $5
billion. Sponsored agencies, mainly those supporting housing--whose
issues are not purchased by the Federal Financing Bank--are also
expected to need $6 billion this quarter.
The expanded Treasury offerings could be expected to raise
bill and other Treasury yields. However, the market impact of these
issues is likely to be blunted by foreign official purchases--either in
the market or special issues--with an Increasing share of the foreign

II -4
demand from oil-exporting countries. If foreign buying is large, the
supply of marketable Treasury issues available to the domestic public
would contract further this summer, although the supply of agency
offerings will expand. Such developments would tend to widen further
the spread between Treasury and other securities yields.
About 45 per cent of projected corporate bond offerings in
the current month are accounted for by the still uncertain $850 million
offering of Citicorp and $200 million by Chase. These securities, with
floating rates and "cash in" privileges each six months, are designed
to attract small investors. As such they are likely to result in out-
flows from thrift institutions and commercial banks, as well as the
Treasury bill market, rather than absorbing funds from traditional bond
investors. Nevertheless, these issues have affected the scheduling
of regular corporate bond issues, and if these two issues do not
materialize, other more traditional issuers would likely accelerate
their offerings to fill the void in the corporate calendar. Thus,
under current money market conditions, bond yields would probably rise
from current levels although postponements and cancellations of scheduled
issues could continue.
Inflows of consumer time and savings deposits to banks and
thrift institutions are likely to be under considerable restraint over
the summer, as the pull of market yields continues to shift small savers
to the securities markets. Marketing of Citicorp and Chase issues
would, of course, increase fund outflows in July from these institutions.
Even if these issues do not come to market, however, new residential

II -5
mortgage commitments can be expected to decline further, mortgage
availability to become even more restricted, and Federal agency support
to the mortgage market even larger.
Business loan demands at banks are likely to continue to be
sustained by takedowns of commitments by borrowers unable or unwill-
ing to finance in money and capital markets. In the current financial
environment, banks can be expected to tighten their lending terms
further and to review their commitments policies, but to meet their
existing commitments by borrowing mainly in the CD market and perhaps
also the Euro-dollar market. Large prime banks may continue to attract
time deposits from abroad, but less-than-prime banks could face some
difficulty in placing CD's if financial market confidence deteriorates
further.

II -6
Monetary aggregates. In June, rates of growth of M1, M2, and
M3 were more rapid than in May, but for the second quarter as a whole
they were below first quarter rates. Part of the growth of M in June--
about 1-1/2 percentage points--was attributable to the temporary lodging
of payments to oil-exporting countries in foreign official deposits at
Federal Reserve Banks and commercial banks. M2 accelerated to almost
twice the rate of the previous month, reflecting both a sharp increase
in inflows to banks of time and savings deposits other than large CD's
and faster growth of M1.Staff estimates suggest that the acceleration
of the "other time" component of M2 was due to a reversal of the two-
month decline of small denomination deposits. As with M2, the growth
of M3 reflected stronger inflows of consumer deposits at thrift insti-
tutions.
Loan growth moderated at banks in late May and early June;
consequently, banks did not increase their outstanding CD's, and
Euro-dollar borrowing and outstanding bank-related commercial paper
declined over that period. But around the June tax date, as business
loan demand picked up, Euro-dollar borrowings of banks began to expand
once more, and CD's were issued in volume--particularly by the large
New York City and Chicago banks. There are reports that regional
banks have experienced difficulty in placing their CD's, but at this
writing the staff has been unable to confirm the rumors. Through the
month, foreign official institutions and foreign commercial banks pur-
chased a sizeable volume of CD's. Despite the pick up after mid-month,
the weakness in late May and early June resulted in a monthly average
decline of non-deposit sources of funds in June, mostly associated

with reduced Euro-dollar borrowing, and growth of CD's was considerably
less on average than in April and May.
Bank credit. Total loans and investments at commercial banks
in the month of June as a whole expanded considerably less than in the
prior three months. Enlarged purchases of securities accompanied the
deceleration of loan growth. Municipal bonds were added to bank port-
folios during the month, with New York City banks being major pur-
chasers of large local issues, and banks generally bought a substan-
tial part of new Federal agency offerings (included in other securities)
at mid-month.
The monthly bank credit statistics mask the sharp pick up
in business loan expansion between mid-June and early July that offset
weaker business loan expansion early in the month. Most of the strength
in loans after mid-month occurred at large New York City and Chicago
banks, and it appears that many of the borrowers were diverted not
only from commercial paper but also from capital markets where a
large volume of issues were postponed, cancelled, or reduced. The
heavy borrowing at large banks took place against a backdrop of con-
tinued tightening in bank lending terms and commitments policy and
continued large aggregate financing needs of both financial and non-
financial corporations.
The composition of business borrowing at large banks in
June was less concentrated in a few industries than in May when
public utilities, construction companies, and oil companies accounted
for almost all the loan growth. The business loan growth in June was
broadly spread among public utilities, textile firms, metal fabricating

Loans to nonbank financial institutions rose less than seasonally
in June after showing substantial increases in April and May. The June
decline, however, may be more apparent than real, since the seasonal
factor anticipates a large shifting from the commercial paper market to
bank loans as the holders' proceeds of maturing paper are used for mid-

As noted earlier, the commercial paper market remains highly
quality conscious, and commercial paper outstanding showed no growth in
June. Dealer-placed paper by prime borrowers, however, had been quite
strong until late in the month, at which time these borrowers apparent-
ly shifted bank to banks as the commercial paper rates rose relative
to the lagging prime rate. Over the month as a whole, total short-
term business credit expansion--as measured by the sum of business
loans and dealer-placed commercial paper--moderated considerably to the
lowest rate of growth of the year.

Nonbank financial intermediaries. Deposit growth at S&Ls
and MSBs during the second quarter is estimated to have been relatively
weak, as in the summer of 1973. At both institutions deposit growth
was stronger in June than during the first two months of the quarter.
June experience at S&Ls showed moderate inflows partially offset by
deposit losses in the last 10 days, followed by an estimated $2.7
billion in interest credited at the end of the month. Interest
credited also bolstered MSB deposits in June, but these institutions
had deposit losses (exclusive of interest) throughout the month.
During the 3-grace days at the end of the month, a sample of large New
York City MSBs had net deposit losses of $143 million--only moderately
larger than in other recent years. However, more recent data for
these New York City MSBs indicate they experienced heavy withdrawal
pressures in early July. On just the first day of the month these
large MSBs had a net loss of $75 million, as compared with a loss of
$89 million during the first 5 business days of July a year ago. Losses
during the first 5 days of July 1974 totaled $171 million.

The net increase in FHLB advances during June was approximately
$800 million, about the same as in May. Over half of this increase
was attributable to advances taken down under the 8-1/2 per cent
special commitment program instituted last fall, leaving about $650
million of such commitments outstanding at the end of June. The
remaining $400 million of regular advances and advances given out
under other special programs in June were available only to those S&Ls
that had reduced their liquidity to the 6 per cent level--a require-
ment imposed by all District FHLBanks in mid-May in order to allocate
funds to those members who demonstrated need. In early July, the
demand for advances continued strong and net advances accelerated to
a pace of about $75 million per day.Both

Long-term securities markets. Corporate and municipal yields
have risen about 60 basis points in the last four weeks, while the rise
in long-term Governments has been substantially less. The market has
been dominated by a preference for quality, and several utilities have
been forced to take new tacks to obtain needed financing. Some have
come to market with 10-year call protection and strict sinking fund
requirements--provisions typically found only on industrial issues.
Others have shortened the maturity of their issues to the 5 to 8 year
range to take advantage of favorable yield spreads and, more importantly,
to tap a market where there is currently substantial demand by individual
investors. The yield spread between different rating categories has
been widening, and investors have become increasingly wary of the
verdicts rendered by rating agencies. In some cases, bonds with the
same rating have differed in yield by as much as 80 basis points.
Several poorly priced issues were recently freed from syndicate restric-
tions only one or two days after offering, and dealer positions in the
corporate and Government markets are especially light.
Following a short rally in the beginning of June, stock
prices fell sharply in the last three weeks of the month and early July.
While the Dow-Jones Industrials fell about 8 per cent, other more
broadly based indices fell by even greater amounts to levels last seen
in 1970. The decline was led by bank stocks, as investors became
increasingly concerned about the adequacy of bank capital, the quality
of loans, especially to REITS, and particular incidents such as the
problems of Franklin National and the closing of Bankhaus Herstatt in
Cologne.

The volume of corporate security offerings in June was sub-
stantially less than previously expected as the decline in bond and
stock prices precipitated about $900 million of postponements, can-
cellations and reductions in size of several issues, mostly by utilities
and financial institutions. Citing financial conditions, reduced
demand for electricity, and other unfavorable factors, several utilities
have recently announced reductions in planned capital expenditures.Long-term

Corporate financing in July is expected to be unseasonably
heavy although the amount is particularly uncertain at this time. The
postponement activity of late June has continued in July. The calendar
includes over $1 billion of long-term issues by Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan specifically designed to attract individual investors instead
of the institutional buyers which normally dominate the bond market.
The interest rate on the issues will change every six months, and will
be one percentage point above the average of the 3-month Treasury bill
rate in the first three bill auctions the month before the interest pay-
ment date. Also, the investor has the option, on each interest payment
date, of redeeming the issues at par. If the issues are successful,
other institutions may try this form of financing. On the other hand,
if they are cancelled because of political or regulatory pressures,
several other nonbank companies that are registered for traditional bond
financing but do not have definite offering dates could jump in to fill
some of the resulting void in the market. Given current and expected
schedulings, the August volume of offerings will be slightly less than
July, although still quite large for this month.

The volume of municipal offerings is expected to decline
slightly in July and August. Several municipal governments have also
recently postponed scheduled financial offerings citing unfavorable mar-
ket conditions and, in some cases, statutory interest rate ceilings.
Some units apparently have chosen to increase their issuance of short-
term notes as a means of temporary financing. The volume of gross new
issues of tax-exempt short-term notes rose substantially in June, and is
expected to remain high in the near term.
Consumer credit. Total consumer credit outstanding rose $19.7
billion in May, seasonally adjusted annual rate. Growth in April was
at a rate of $18.0 billion. While the gains during the first two months
of the second quarter represent a substantial acceleration from the
first quarter rate of $8.2 billion, the rate continues below the $24.1
billion of the second quarter of 1973.
Instalment debt rose at a $15.1 billion seasonally adjusted
annual rate in May compared with $13.8 billion in April. The modest
increase resulted from a larger advance in automobile credit and the
second consecutive monthly record in home improvement loans. Growth in
"other consumer goods" credit and personal loans remained at about the
April rate.
Both extensions and repayments of instalment credit reached
new highs in May. Extensions were at record levels for all categories
of instalment credit except automobiles. Repayments, which had eased
slightly in April after successive highs in each month of the first
quarter, rebounded sharply in May.

Although extensions of automobile credit are still running
somewhat below the rate that prevailed throughout most of 1973, the
decline in credit extensions this spring has not matched the decline in
unit sales. The number of new car sales on credit as a proportion of
total new car sales has been relatively stable, but average contract
size has been increasing. This increase reflects the leveling in the
proportion of small car sales, higher prices on all models, and rising
finance rates. In May, the average amount financed on new car contracts
purchased from retail dealers by finance companies reached $3,531, an
increase of $50 from April and nearly $200 from December. Finance
charges are adding to the burden in two ways--rates have turned up again
after declining during the first quarter, and contract maturities are be-
ing extended. At finance companies, the weighted average maturity of new
car contracts is 35.6 months with 6 per cent of all contracts having
maturities in excess of 36 months. At commercial banks, more than 7
per cent of the contracts now have maturities over 36 months.

II -19
Short-term interest rates. At the time of the June FOMC
meeting, most short-term interest rates had resumed their upward climb,
after edging down somewhat in late May. Since that meeting, most private
short-term rates have risen substantially further to new historical
highs, while, in sharp contrast, Treasury bill rates have changed
much less, with rates on shorter-term bills actually declining.
Much of the recent rise in private short-term rates has been
the usual lagged response to movements in the Federal funds rate, which
rose toward 12 per cent just prior to the June meeting and has moved
considerably higher since. On most days recently, the daily effective
Federal funds rate has been above 13 per cent, reaching a record high of
14.33 on July 1. An additional source of upward rate pressure has been
the surge in short-term business credit demands, which have been bolstered
recently by borrowers waiting for conditions to improve in the bond
market. Moreover, money market pressures continue to be greatly aggravated
by the strong investor preference for top quality instruments. There
are widespread reports, for example, that less than prime nonfinancial
borrowers, REITs, and some regional bank holding companies are encount-
ering progressively greater difficulties in raising funds in the
commercial paper market.
As a result of such pressures, record rate levels have been
reached in the markets for commercial paper, CD's, and bankers accept-
ances--in the neighborhood of 12 per cent and above. Similarly, the
prime rate has generally risen to 12 per cent, with a few banks moving
further to 12-1/4 per cent.

II -20
In the Treasury bill market, most rates have increased
relatively little if at all, thus leading to a further increase in rate
spreads between bills and other money market instruments. The Desk
bought over $1.2 billion (net) of bills for foreign central banks in
June, including some investment of oil proceeds by a Mid-east country.
Noncompetitive tenders in the weekly bill auctions have continued to be
unusually large, and there was some reinvestment demand by holders of
$4.5 billion of maturing June TABs, of which only about $.8 billion
were turned in for taxes. Against this background of exceptionally
strong demands, dealer bill holdings have decreased still further and
have been in a net short position on most days since the last meeting.
Indeed, the System has had some technical difficulties in supplying
reserves recently, because of the shortage of bills available for pur-
chase in the market.
Looking ahead, the Treasury is expected to come to the market
in the near term with the first security offering of the Federal
Financing Bank, amounting perhaps to $1.0 to $1.5 billion. Further, it
currently appears that the Treasury may need to raise about $2.0 to $2.5
billion of new money in late July or early August, perhaps partly in
the form of September TABs. Over the third quarter as a whole, the
Treasury and the Financing Bank are expected to raise a total of about
$5.0 billion of new money, about in line with past average third
quarter borrowings of the Treasury and Budget Agencies combined. The
calendar of borrowing by the sponsored agencies over the third quarter,

II -21
however, has risen still further to an exceptionally large amount,
averaging nearly $2.0 billion per month, so that the combined calendar
of Federal and Federally sponsored borrowing appears to be fairly
heavy.
It should be noted that the Treasury is reported to be
negotiating with the oil producing countries about channeling a large
share of their proceeds into Treasury issues. Such foreign purchases
would, of course, considerably reduce the pressure that the expected
Federal financing needs will place on the Treasury securities market.

Mortgage market. Mortgage markets tightened somewhat further
during June and early July. While the increases were moderate and
irregular, interest rates on new commitments for home mortgages reached
new highs in both the primary and secondary mortgage markets, and non-
rate loan terms continued to become more restrictive. Seasonally
adjusted new commitments for mortgages at savings and loan associations,
which had declined substantially in May after seven consecutive months
of recovery from last September's low, apparently dropped further in
June as S&L's continued to report funds in short supply in virtually all
of the 12 FHLBank districts.
Average contract interest rates on new commitments for 80
per cent conventional home loans at selected savings and loans tended
higher through July 5 to a level of 9.14 per cent. This was above pre-
vailing usury ceilings in 16 states and the District of Columbia. More-
over, mortgage investment generally has remained relatively unattractive
to diversified lenders as yields on new issues of high-grade utility
bonds have held above yields on home mortgages in most areas of the
country, even before allowance for the higher servicing costs associated
with mortgages. Non-rate loan terms offered on home mortgage commit-
ments also tightened further in June. Even so, about two-thirds of
S&L's were still offering 90-per cent 25-year financing to eligible
borrowers; this compared with a low of about one-half of the S&L's in
this category last September.

mortgage bankers that mortgage prices may fall further in the near
future. At the same time, the average yield on accepted bids rose by
11 basis points to a new high after leveling off in the first half of
June.

Activity under the subsidy programs announced by the Admini-
stration in May generally has remained strong. Through July 5, the
FHLMC had already issued $2.1 billion in commitments under the program
to purchase up to $3 billion of 8-3/4 per cent conventional new-home
mortgages. Furthermore, applications to the FHLBanks for the new
subsidized advances have been exceeding the $500 million per month pace
scheduled for the rest of the year. Some support is also being generated
by the GNMA Tandem Plan, although in June GNMA issued commitments to
purchase below-market-rate mortgages on fewer than 13,000 units--and,
altogether, commitments for only about 100,000 units have been issued
since the first phase of the program began in late January.1/ One reason
mentioned by the trade for this relative sluggishness is that the low
contract rate on the mortgages involved in the program at a time of
rising market interest rates tends to make the cost of warehousing pro-
hibitive for mortgage originators, despite the potential appeal of such
mortgages to home buyers and builders.
With 8-3/4 per cent FHA/VA mortgages selling at discounts of
more than 5 points, the maximum contract interest rate on Government-
underwritten mortgages was raised one-quarter percentage point by
administrative action to a record level of 9 per cent, effective July 8.
This was the third such rise since mid-April. Rates specified for
mortgages under GNMA's Tandem Plan, however, remain unchanged.
1/ The January 22 plan provides for GNMA purchase of 200,000 new-unit
FHA/VA mortgages which must bear a contract interest rate of 7-3/4
per cent. The supplemental plan announced May 10 provides for pur-
chase of an additional 100,000 mortgages with contract rates of
8 per cent.

II -27
Federal finance. The budgetary outlook for fiscal 1975 is
quite tentative at this time because of pending Congressional action
regarding both expenditure and tax programs. As yet, action has not
been completed on any of the major appropriations bills. Considerable
debate is expected on the "Oil and Gas Energy Tax Act of 1974".
Although this measure has been approved by the Ways and Means Committee,
floor procedures regarding amendments have not yet been fully determined
(staff projections assume enactment) Recently, the Ways and Means
Committee rescheduled the target date for completion of its report
on tax reform legislation from June 30 to July 20. The Congress has
passed the "Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974"
that would affect budgets beginning in fiscal year 1976. It is
uncertain, however, whether the President will sign the bill because
of its anti-impoundment provisions.
While there has been no official change in the Administration's
budget forecast, the President has stated that an anti-inflation spending
cut of $5 billion has been targeted for the current fiscal year.
However, little information has been provided on where reductions
might take place, and this target could be difficult to achieve
given the level of commitments implied by existing legislation and
court rulings on impoundment. On the tax side, Secretary Simon re-
ported that the Treasury is currently studying the possibility of a
"balanced tax package" that would provide incentives for business
investment and give tax relief to low-income individuals; he indicated
that some offsetting revenue might be obtained from changing the tax
treatment of capital gains in a way which would "unlock" investors.

II -28
Because of these various uncertainties, the staff has not
changed its $304 billion outlays projection for the new fiscal year.
The receipts estimate, however, has been lowered by $1.1 billion to a
level of $294.9 billion in response to revised income assumptions and
a lower estimated effective corporate tax rate. These projections
result in a $9.1 billion deficit for fiscal 1975. For the preceding
fiscal year, preliminary data suggests a deficit of $3.0 billion,
reflecting receipts of $264.5 billion and outlays of $267.5 billion.
On July 1st, the Treasury released a report stating that it
would seek legislation permitting it to invest its tax and loan account
balances in interest-bearing instruments, and directly compensate banks
for the services they render. In the interim, the Treasury said it
would reduce the level of these balances, and experiment with placing
funds in thirty-day time deposits. No legislation is required as long
as the funds are kept in the form of deposits. (A summary of this
report will be presented in an Appendix to the Greenbook Supplement.)
On June 30, the President signed the bill raising the debt ceiling to
$495 billion through March 31. Originally, the Administration had
requested a $505 billion ceiling through June 30, 1975.

of the market activities of budget agencies are expected to be handled by the Federal Financing
Bank in fiscal year 1975.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Summary and outlook. The dollar has appreciated by about 1/2
per cent on a weighted average basis over the past month, to a level
about 2-1/2 per cent above its mid-May low. This improvement has
occurred despite a probable further deterioration in the trade balance
(already in deficit at an annual rate of $6.8 billion in April-May
combined), and while net private capital flows are still probably tending
to move outward.
Data for bank-reported claims on foreigners showed a jump of
about $3 billion in May (about equally divided between U.S. commercial
banks and agencies and branches of foreign banks) and weekly data for
member banks show some further rise in June. Banks' liabilities to
foreign commercial banks were also rising, but by lesser amounts.
Foreign dealings in U.S. corporate stocks appear to have turned negative
in May, and a pickup since then seems unlikely. Finally, some of the
inflows of capital in the first quarter associated with the activities
of the major petroleum companies were probably reversed during the
second quarter to meet payments of taxes and royalties to oil-producing
countries.
In terms of the official settlements balance the United States
had a deficit of about $2 billion in June, and probably over $4 billion
(not seasonally adjusted) for the second quarter as a whole. However,
this does not reflect to any great extent a buildup of dollar holdings

III -2
as a result of official intervention in exchange markets to support
the dollar against other major currencies; reserves of the major indus-
trial countries as a group changed very little in June, and rose only
about $1/2 billion during the second quarter. The main increase in
official dollar holdings in the United States was by other countries --
and partial data indicate that most of the gain was by oil producers.
Thus, the placement of funds by these countries has provided consider-
able support for the U.S. dollar in recent months. Apart from this
feature, the strength of the dollar in exchange markets probably
reflects the generalized effects on market attitudes of high and
rising interest rates in the United States.
The near-term outlook for economic activity in other industrial
countries (with the exception of Canada) is for continued slow growth
in internal demand, and in some countries for a further slowing in the
rates of growth. In Japan, France and Italy, policy actions aim at
achieving such a slowdown; in other countries the effects of past
restrictive actions, combined with an erosion in the growth of real
incomes, are acting to depress economic activity. Disruptions of
banking markets may also dampen activity. In most countries, exports
are looked to as a major support to economic activity rates, but such
expectations cannot materialize if internal demand remains sluggish
in most industrial countries. However, with inflation rates remaining
in the two-digit range almost everywhere, except in Germany, Austria
and the Netherlands, policy concerns continue to focus primarily on
reducing inflationary pressures.

III -3
The outlook for the U.S. balance of payments has not changed
materially; the balance on goods and services is expected to worsen
considerably over the year ahead, with over-all balance and the
strength of the dollar depending largely on the extent to which oil-
producing countries place funds in U.S. capital markets, as well as
on the net flow of private capital between the U.S. and other countries.
Foreign exchange markets. The weighted average exchange
value of the dollar has increased by 1/2 per cent from its level of
four weeks ago, and currently stands 6 per cent above its value of
last October and 6 per cent below its high of late January.
The dominant feature of exchange markets during the past
month has been the sharp drop in trading activity following the June 26
foreign exchange related failure of the Herstatt Bank in Germany.
Uncertainty created by the Herstatt failure caused an immediate drop
in the volume of trading on the New York and European foreign exchange
markets to below half of its normal level. Although trading activity
has increased somewhat so far in July, it remains well below normal.
The mark-dollar exchange rate experienced conflicting pressures
over the past month. The strong upward movement of U.S. interest rates
during the period and the Bundesbank's move to provide increased re-
discount assistance to the German banking system put upward exchange
rate pressure on the dollar relative to the mark. Pressure in the
opposite direction was generated by the swing into substantial deficit

III -4
of the May U.S. trade balance and the further increase in the May German
trade surplus to 4.9 billion marks. On balance, the dollar has shown a
net gain of 1-1/2 per cent against the mark since mid-June, moving up
by smaller amounts against the other snake currencies and the Swiss franc.
During the last two weeks of June the Bundesbank made intervention sales
of $130 million and the System purchased marks in the New York market and
made swap repayments totaling $106 million equivalent.
The dollar has depreciated by 1-1/2 per cent against the French
franc and lira over the past month. The rise in the franc was stimulated
by a tightening of the French money market and the announcement of a $5
billion export agreement with Iran. The increased demand for the lira
followed the announcement of stringent anti-inflation measures by the
Italian government. The central banks of France and Italy both made inter-
vention purchases totaling about $200 million in the last two weeks of
June. The Italian intervention purchases partially balance intervention
sales by the Bank of Italy totaling $500 million earlier in June.
In other intervention activity, the Swiss National Bank made
substantial swap dollar purchases to provide quarter-end liquidity to the
Swiss banking system while the Bank of England engaged in sales of dollars
on a swap basis in order to reduce excess liquidity in the British money
market. The Bank of Canada made small net sales of dollars during the
period to moderate an easing of the Canadian dollar rate.
The gold price dropped sharply from a high of $160 on June 14
to a low of $129 on July 4, then made an equally sharp recovery to a current
level above $140.

III -5
Euro-dollar market. Euro-dollar interest rates, along with U.S.
interest rates, have risen to record highs in recent weeks. In the week
ended July 10 the overnight deposit rate averaged 13-7/16 per cent, up
2-1/4 percentage points from four weeks earlier. Three-month Euro-dollar
deposit rates averaged 13-13/16 per cent in the week ended July 10, also
an increase of 2-1/4 percentage points in four weeks.
U.S. banks' liabilities to their foreign branches, after declining
sharply in the first half of June, turned up, rising by nearly $1 billion
in the two weeks to July 5 to a level of $3.6 billion.
Apart from the influence of U.S. interest rate movements, and
continued strong loan demand in the Euro-markets, one additional factor
putting upward pressure on Euro-dollar rates in recent weeks has reportedly
been an increase in the "risk" premium demanded by investors in that market,
particularly arising from the Franklin National and Herstatt troubles,
and in general from the widespread talk about the Euro-markets lacking a
lender of last resort, etc. Presumably it is this increased risk premium
which accounts for the wide differential (1-3/4 per cent, or so) which
has opened up between U.S. CD rates and three-month Euro-dollar deposits.
A wider differential between Euro-dollar loan rates and U.S.
bank loan rates has also developed in recent weeks as can be seen in Table 2.
This reflects both a wider differential on deposit rates and
a wider spread between deposit and loan rates in the Euro-market, the
latter emerging as the lending banks themselves have perceived greater

risks, perhaps related to problems of maturity structure of their assets
and liabilities and/or perhaps to growing concern over the creditworthiness
of borrowers.
Arrangements for publicized medium-term Euro-currency loans
came to $2.1 billion in June, according to preliminary World Bank estimates,
off from the revised level of $2.8 billion in May. For the second quarter,
publicized arrangements averaged $2.6 billion per month, down sharply from
the $4.6 billion monthly average for the first quarter. In June, loans
of $100 million or more were arranged by the Royal Dutch Shell group ($400
million), Mexicana de Cobre S.A., ($300 million), the Bank of Greece ($200
million), the Government of Brazil ($150 million), the Gabonese Railways
($150 million), the Central Bank of the Philippines ($150 million), the
Government of Argentina ($100 million), and the Xerox Corporation ($100
million).
U.S. balance of payments. Over-all indicators of the U.S.
international position showed mixed movements in June. The dollar
appreciated slightly, on average, against the major foreign currencies,
following a steady depreciation since January. However, based on very
preliminary data it appears that the official settlements balance was
in substantial deficit in June -- over $2 billion (not seasonally
adjusted, not at annual rate). For the second quarter this balance is
estimated to have been in deficit by around $4-1/2 billion (seasonally
adjusted, not at annual rate). This compares with surpluses of $1 billion
in the first quarter and $2-3/4 billion in the fourth quarter of 1973.

III -8
U.S. liabilities to official institutions of the major oil-exporting
countries rose by about $1 billion in the first quarter and probably by
more than $2 billion in the second.
There is very little information available on the components of
the balance of payments for the second quarter, but information which is
available for April-May indicates that the deterioration in the official
settlements balance stems, at least in part, from a large trade deficit
and a further increase in bank-reported net capital outflows. For April
and May combined the trade deficit was over $1 billion (seasonally adjusted,
not at annual rate), compared with a small surplus in the first quarter;
the deterioration reflects a sharp rise in the price of imported oil.
Bank-reported capital flows for April-May show a net outflow of $1-3/4
billion (not seasonally adjusted, not at annual rate), compared with about
$3/4 billion for the entire first quarter. Bank-reported claims on
foreigners in April and May combined increased by $4-1/2 billion, with
almost $3 billion reported by U.S. commercial banks and the remainder by
U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks. For the same period liquid
liabilities to private foreigners increased $2-3/4 billion, of which
$1/2 billion was reported by U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks.
Private securities transactions resulted in a small net outflow
in April and May together, compared to a small net inflow in the first
quarter. Foreigners sold, net, a small amount of U.S. stocks in May and
reduced their net purchases of bonds. U.S. purchases of new foreign

III -9
bond issues also dropped in May; issues by countries previously affected
by the Interest Equalization Tax continued to be small.
Complete information on the U.S. balance of payments for the
first quarter of this year indicates that much of the change from the
fourth quarter resulted from petroleum-related transactions. The removal
of controls on capital flows, both by the United States and foreign
countries, was also a significant element. The total balance on goods and
services in the first quarter was essentially unchanged from the fourth
quarter, holding at the large surplus of $2.9 billion (seasonally adjusted,
not at an annual rate). However, the first quarter results were affected
favorably by a steep and probably temporary rise in the reported foreign
earnings of U.S. oil companies. The trade balance showed an equal and
offsetting decline.
The basic balance (sum of current account and long-term capital
transactions) was in surplus by over $2 billion in the first quarter
compared with a deficit of $1/2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1973.
This shift reflected a substantial decline in U.S. direct investments
abroad and a rise in foreign direct investments in the United States.
The favorable changes in these accounts are also probably temporary,
reflecting delays by U.S. oil companies in payments to their foreign
affiliates as well as an inflow representing unpaid dividends to Saudi Arabia
on its share of petroleum earnings. To an extent, which will not be known
for some time, these transactions that strengthened the international
accounts in the first quarter will be unwound in the second and subsequent
quarters.

U.S. merchandise trade. In May, the U.S. trade balance
deteriorated sharply, registering a deficit of $11.9 billion at an
annual rate (balance-of-payments basis) as exports declined by 8 percent,
while imports rose by more than 2 percent. For April-May combined the
trade balance was in deficit by $6.8 billion at an annual rate, as
compared to a small surplus in the first quarter. The dominant factor
in the worsening of the trade balance between the first quarter and
April-May was the more than $9 billion increase in fuel imports. There
was also a dip in agricultural exports. The trade balance, excluding
agricultural exports and fuel imports, would have shown a more than
$3 billion improvement (at an annual rate) in April-May.

By country, the U.S. trade balance with the less-developed
petroleum supplying countries deteriorated sharply, even though U.S.
exports to those countries rose appreciably. The trade balance with other
developing countries improved slightly or remained steady, as the increase
in exports and imports was evenly matched. However, the U.S. trade
balance with the developed countries declined in April-May; sharp increases
in imports from Germany and Japan combined with a flattening out in
exports to both of those countries were responsible for most of that
decline.
U.S. exports for April-May were at an annual rate of $93.8
billion (balance of payments basis),5 percent above their first quarter
level. The increase resulted entirely from larger shipments of non-
agricultural products; exports of agricultural goods declined by nearly
$1 billion from the record first quarter rate.
The decline in the value of agricultural exports -- the first
decline since the second quarter of 1972 -- stemmed from a drop in
volume, particularly wheat, while the export unit value showed a small
increase. However, in May, export prices of many commodities such as
wheat, corn, rice, and soybeans levelled off or declined. With the
increased supply of agricultural goods in world markets, U.S. agricultural
export- prices may decline further in coming months.
The value of U.S. exports of nonagricultural goods increased
in April-May in all major categories, except civilian aircraft. Increased

III -12
shipments of both machinery and industrial supplies accounted for most
of the gain. While the increase in the value of machinery exports was
in volume, the advance in the value of industrial supplies was largely
the effect of higher prices. With the weakening in world demand for
industrial supplies, as evidenced by recent declines in prices of metals
in commodity markets, the rate of increase in prices of materials exports
may slacken. On the other hand, foreign orders for U.S. durable equip-
ment (excluding aircraft) continued to rise in April-May suggesting
continued strength in such exports.
U.S. imports for April-May were at annual rate of $100.6 billion
(balance of payments basis), an increase of nearly $12 billion from the
first quarter rate. The 45 percent jump in the value of fuel imports in
April-May was responsible for most of the gain in the value of total
imports. The average price of oil imports was $11.61 per barrel in
April-May compared with $9.10 in the first quarter. With the lifting of
the oil embargo in late March, the volume of oil imports averaged more
than 6.5 million barrels a day in April-May, as compared with an average
of 5.9 million barrels per day in the first three months of the year,
and it is expected that the volume of oil imports will average about
7 million barrels a day during the rest of the year.
The somewhat higher value of nonfuel imports in April-May
resulted entirely from higher prices; volumes declined. Decreases in
the volume of food imports (particularly coffee, cocoa, and meat) and

III -13
automotive vehicles from Canada were responsible for most of the decline
in volume. With the continued sluggishness in U.S. activity, the volume
of imports of industrial supplies has remained virtually flat. In addition,
the April-May volume of imports of consumer goods (excluding cars and
food) rose only slightly above the first quarter level. So far this year,
the monthly volume of consumer goods imports has continued below the
average monthly levels of 1972 and 1973, probably reflecting in large
part the effect of the exchange rate realignments begun in 1971.
In contrast, the volume of imports of foreign-type cars in
April-May continued to increase -- more than 20 percent above the
already high first quarter rate. In every month this year, imports
have been far in excess of U.S. sales, and some foreign car suppliers
have announced plans to cut back their deliveries to the United States
in order to reduce the current high stock-sale ratio.

III -14
Economic activity in major foreign industrial countries. At
the recent meeting of the OECD's Economic Policy Committee in Paris, it
was clear that the main policy concern of the industrial countries
was the need to bring the rapid rise in the level of prices under con-
trol. The consensus was that the series of restrictive policy
measures taken in most countries over recent months has been appropriate.
However, opinions varied as to whether actions taken so far would be
sufficient to achieve the desired moderation in price increases,
whether further restriction would be necessary, and at what point
relaxation of these measures would be appropriate. Most authorities
are facing the same policy dilemma: will restrictive actions create
a downturn leading to possible "stag-" or "slump-flation," or are
inflationary pressures still so tenacious that, despite the downward
risks, continued or additional restriction is necessary? A further
consideration is that restrictive policy measures are being taken
simultaneously in many countries and could, therefore, have a
cumulative effect on economic activity.
The authorities' present concern with the need for restriction
represents a change from early this year when the major concern for
many countries was the possibility of a world recession in the wake
of the oil crisis. This fear receded when countries came out of the
oil-embargo period with a somewhat smaller decline in economic
activity, but with much more rapid price increases, than had been

III -15
expected. This situation led almost all governments to tighten monetary
policies, and in most cases also to tighten fiscal policies. Consumer
prices in all of the industrial countries, with the exception of Austria,
Germany, and the Netherlands, are now rising at year-over-year rates of
from 10 to over 20 per cent, and there is little hope that these rates
of increase will decline significantly before the end of the year.
Inflationary pressures are also being aggravated as wage earners attempt
to protect their real earnings by demanding large catch-up wage settle-
ments. Although excess demand is not a general problem any longer,
most authorities are relying on traditional demand management instru-
ments in their attempts to control inflation. Except in a few
countries, such as Austria, where price and wage controls have worked
fairly well, it appears that most policy makers have become dis-
enchanted with the use of these auxiliary policy instruments; thus,
they are now willing to accept the risks of depressing demand levels
more than they might otherwise think desirable.
In all of the major industrial countries except Canada, a
slowdown in rates of growth of real GNP began in the third or fourth
quarter of 1973. (See table.) Given the further slowdown -- or
actual decline -- in the growth of real GNP in the first quarter of
this year and the cumulation of recent restrictive policy measures,
the official projections for 1974 over 1973 shown in the table would
appear to be at the upper range of what seems feasible. First, most

of the country projections assume a relatively fast expansion of
exports; if this expansion is less than expected, total activity
could be significantly lower than predicted. Second, the outlook is
based on a general expectation of relatively strong private investment
demand. The capacity shortages which became evident last year are
expected to motivate businesses to increase their investment plans
regardless of any short-term sluggishness of demand. However, because
of weak capital market conditions, it may be difficult for some
companies to realize their investment intentions. And third, since
inflation rates have cut into real purchasing power in most countries,
forecasts of some increase in consumption expenditures are predicated
upon falls in savings rates, which may not be as significant as expected.
A major danger in underestimating the downward risks inherent
in the current situation is that, if activity rates begin to fall off
much more rapidly than currently expected and if liquidity squeezes
produce a relatively large number of business failures, governments
may be forced to take expansionary action on a larger scale than
would be consistent with the aim of avoiding renewed inflationary
pressures. Thus, the acceptance of the considerable downside risk does
not necessarily rule out the risk of continued inflation.
The United Kingdom provides a good example of the policy
dilemma facing the governments of the major industrial countries.

After a very sharp upward spurt from mid-1972 through early 1973,
economic activity remained flat, although at a high level through
the rest of 1973. The growth of real GDP in 1973 over 1972 was a
record 5.6 per cent, as compared to a longer run average rate of
just under 3 per cent. Because of the disruptions associated with
the miners' strike and the oil crisis, there was a large drop in real
GDP in the first quarter of 1974, but not as great a decrease as
had been originally expected. Measures announced in mid-December to
restrict demand have been maintained and were reinforced at the end
of March by the 1974/75 Budget. However, in view of the likely
cumulative effects of these measures, the authorities now are considering
some easing of policy, despite the fact that consumer prices are
rising at a year-over-year rate of about 16 per cent.
Private consumption expenditure has been weak, and expected
slow or negative growth of real incomes, combined with the possibility
that consumers may want to rebuild their savings after a first quarter
rundown,suggests that it may remain so. Private investment also is
not likely to show much strength, because of uncertainties about
current proposals regarding government participation in industry and
also because of financing problems. As in other countries, tight
monetary conditions have led to a considerable fall in residential
construction.

III -19
There are indications that there has been some shift of
resources into export industries, which is essential for the
achievement of the government's second major policy goal, the improve-
ment of the external balance. But the achievement of that goal, like
the fight against inflation, is likely to be a slow process, and
external pressures are not likely to be significantly relieved until
the pumping of North Sea oil in substantial volume begins.
In France, real P in the six months ending in March 1974
rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 6 per cent, the
economy's potential rate. However, since the beginning of 1974 growth
has slowed, and for the year as a whole the French authorities expect
real output to grow at a rate of about 5 per cent. The recently
announced anti-inflation program aims at slowing growth in all sectors
of internal demand, in part because supply bottlenecks continue to
exist in various industrial sectors. The stated goals of the plan are
first, to bring the rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, down
from an average monthly increase of 1.4 per cent during the first five
months of 1974 to 0.5 per cent by mid-1975; and second, to reduce the
present monthly trade deficits, which averaged about Ff. 2 billion
per month during the first four months of 1974, by one-half by mid-
1975 and eliminate them by end-1975. Since unemployment is already
high by French standards, the authorities hope that a strong demand

III -20
for French exports will offset the decrease in domestic demand and
consequently, that output will not be affected.
The growth in government spending, consumption expenditure
and residential construction should weaken considerably this year com-
pared with 1973. At present, investment is forecast to increase by 5
per cent in volume this year. However, this estimate seems optimistic
because of tight financial conditions. In addition, the latest
government measures will undoubtedly limit borrowing possibilities
further, and the imposition of an 18 per cent surtax on 1973 corporate
taxes will put an additional burden on industry. In this respect, the
government's austerity program seems to focus more on balance of pay-
ments aims than on eliminating capacity shortages in various sectors.
In Germany, the positive overall rate of growth in the first
quarter of 1974 obscures a fall in internal demand which was more than
offset by a large increase in the external surplus, with the volume of
imports decreasing and that of exports rising strongly. With the slowing
of the overall growth rate, the inflation rate has slowed to about 7
per cent, as measured by the year-over-year rate of increase in the
CPI, still high by German standards. The government's policy is still
aimed primarily at moderating the inflation rate, and in particular,
at forestalling a further upward push on the price level because of
wage increases. The spring negotiations yielded wage increases of
about 13-15 per cent, well above the government's 9 per cent guideline,

III -21
and with current policies it is hoped to bring the rate of increase
below these figures in negotiations later this year.
Because there was little excess demand as early as the middle
of last year, the government began to ease up on its restrictive fiscal
policy towards the end of the year. The 11 per cent investment tax
imposed on private investment in May 1973 was lifted in December,
government budget ceilings were relaxed, and the 10 per cent surtax on
middle- and high-income groups was allowed to expire as of July 1,
1974. (Revenue from that source amounted to 1.6 billion DM in 1973.)
Under current legislative proposals, tax reform will add 12 billion DM
to disposable income at the beginning of next year. Monetary policy
has been eased slightly in the past few weeks.
Official forecasts expect an increase in real GNP of about
2 per cent in 1974 over 1973, mainly because of continued strength of
the external sector, but with the rate of internal growth rising
through the year. If internal demand fails to rise, the government
has indicated its willingness to take stronger expansionary measures.
The authorities are clearly concerned about the current structure of
demand with its heavy emphasis on exports, but expects that as capacity
constraints ease in other countries, the enormous trade surpluses will
recede, and the pattern of growth will shift towards greater dependence
on domestic demand factors.

In Italy, an alarmingly accelerating rate of inflation, with
year-over-year rates of increase of about 15 per cent for the CPI and
45 per cent for the WPI, coupled with intolerably large balance of pay-
ments deficits, has forced the government to impose severely restrictive
measures. Last year, the Italian authorities had hopes of returning
the economy to a steady growth path after years of crippling social
strife. In particular, it was hoped that an upsurge in private invest-
ment demand would provide the basis for further increases in output.
But the current situation has necessarily changed these policy goals.
Limits on credit extension and the import deposit scheme
have produced a liquidity squeeze which is becoming increasingly severe.
Short-term interest rates have risen sharply; the prime rate rose from
9.5 per cent early this year to 15.5 per cent in June. The government
is now reenforcing these measures with a fiscal package that includes
increases in taxes and charges by public utilities and limits on the
growth of government expenditure. The situation is sufficiently critical
to have enabled the precarious government coalition to obtain a
favorable vote of confidence for this stabilization program. The aim
of the program is to slow down internal demand markedly by the end of
this year.
So far this year, the unemployment rate has continued to fall
and in April was 2.6 per cent compared to 3.0 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1973; also, the labor force participation rate has increased.

Industrial production, excluding the automobile sector, probably
remained stable during the first five months of this year. However,
the large fall in demand for automobiles produced a decline in the
overall index.
With the shift in policy, the outlook for this year has
changed markedly. Before the introduction of the stabilization pro-
gram, real GNP was expected to grow by about 4 per cent in 1974 over
1973, partly because of large increases in private investment and
buoyant private consumption. Now, both of these sectors are likely
to provide only a minor source of strength and it is hoped that most
of the slack will be taken up by export demand, although the authorities
are worried that demand conditions in other countries may be such as to
make this difficult.
Under the impact of the energy crisis and the restrictive
monetary and fiscal policies pursued by the Japanese authorities,
output has generally declined since late last year. Real GNP in the first
quarter declined by 5 per cent (over 20 per cent at an annual rate)
from the fourth quarter level, largely because of a 5-1/2 per cent
fall in real personal consumption expenditures. The rapid upsurge
of inflation in Japan, with year-over-year rates of increase of con-
sumer prices now over 20 per cent, cut heavily into real incomes and
caused consumers to curtail their purchases. The large -- even by
Japanese standards -- wage increases negotiated this spring are likely

III -24
to stimulate consumption expenditure over the next few months, but
on balance, no substantial contribution to growth is expected from
this source.
The Japanese authorities are trying to achieve the dual policy
objectives of moderating inflation and bringing about a very substantial
improvement in the external balance. There appears to be some progress
toward achieving both goals. Price increases have moderated somewhat,
although they still remain high and consumer prices may accelerate again
in coming months because of planned increases in transportation and
communication rates, as well as in rice prices. On the external side,
exports have been increasing rapidly in recent months, outpacing the
rise in imports. Consequently, the trade deficit has been cut down
from $1-1/4 billion in the first quarter of this year to a quarterly
rate of under $1/2 billion in April/May.
Despite the progress that is being made towards the government's
stated policy goals, the authorities have repeatedly declared that tight
policies will continue to be pursued until at least late this year,
because of a general fear that inflationary expectations could easily
be rekindled. Thus, government estimates put the change in GNP in 1974
over 1973 at minus 1-1/2 per cent.
In contrast to the situation in some of the other countries,
internal demand in Canada is quite strong. Even if Canadian exports

III -25
do not contribute to growth because of the slowdown in U.S. demand,
real GNP for 1974 as a whole still is expected to increase at a rate
of about 5 per cent, approximately equal to potential. Although as
elsewhere, consumer spending may weaken and tighter credit conditions
may discourage investment, the world commodity boom and the energy
crisis have served to stimulate economic activity in Canada.
With year-over-year rates of increase in the CPI now about
11 per cent, there is a great deal of concern in Canada about inflation,
but policies have been less restrictive than in other countries.
Monetary policy has been tightened considerably since the early part
of 1973 in order to stem inflation, but official statements have
emphasized that monetary policy will continue to accommodate the
growth of output and employment.
The Canadian authorities have chosen to fight inflation by
trying to expand capacity and increase productivity rather than by
deflating demand. However, the Canadian opposition parties did
advocate the use of wage and price controls when they voted against
the government's budget. The pre-election budget represented a more
or less neutral policy stance, and Prime Minister Trudeau had pledged
to reintroduce the same budget proposals if elected. Thus, given
Trudeau's victory in the July 8 election, the general strategy for
dealing with inflation will probably remain the same.
