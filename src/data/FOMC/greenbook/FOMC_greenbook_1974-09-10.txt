DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Judging by incoming but only partial data for August, there
has been little basic change in the lackluster performance of the
economy. No major category of activity is providing any significant
thrust to overall activity. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures continue
intense.
Data on industrial production for August are still fragmen-
tary, and it now seems likely that the index will remain little changed
for the third consecutive month. Auto assemblies were at about an 8.0
million unit annual rate, an increase of only 2 per cent from July--
earlier schedules had called for a 10 per cent increase. Production
has been hampered by continuing parts shortages resulting from strikes
at some suppliers, but a large overhang of 1974 small cars has probably
also contributed to reductions from scheduled output. Production of
other consumer goods has been relatively stable in recent months,
with no indications of improvement.
Production of materials, meanwhile, is likely to show some
decline in August. Strikes at coal and copper mines are partly
responsible. Construction materials output probably declined further
as a consequence of continued weakness in building activity. Raw steel
production in the first three weeks of August was maintained at about
the July level.

II -2
Some further easing in the labor market in August is suggested
by recent data for initial claims for insured unemployment. For the
first four weeks in August, claims averaged about 320,000 (seasonally
adjusted), up more than 10 per cent from July. This rise appears
to be due largely to small, widespread increases in layoffs in
manufacturing and a rise in construction unemployment. The recent
level of initial claims is the highest since November 1970, except
for the period of the energy crisis. The rise in initial claims in
August appears to have been among workers with strong attachments to
the labor force. Thus, if there has been a continuation of the
recent rate of growth in the labor force, the overall unemployment
rate in August might well rise from the 5.3 per cent of July.
Retail sales appear to have risen somewhat further in August
following the sharp July advance, according to staff estimates based
on weekly data. The increase reflects the recent pick-up in auto
sales. Total retail sales, excluding autos and nonconsumer items,
apparently changed little, and in real terms were probably only
a little above the second quarter average.
The auto market has been strong since late July. Sales
of new domestic-type autos in the first 20 days of August were at
a 9.6 million unit annual rate, compared with 8.2 million in July.
The recent strength in sales appears to represent an effort by consumers

II -3
to beat the large price increases announced for 1975 models. The small
car share of domestic-type sales in August, not seasonally adjusted
came to about 33 per cent of the total, the same as in other recent
months, but less than early this year. However, with sales of smaller
cars below expectations, stocks have been.rising steadily--reaching a
78 days' supply at the end of July. In some cases, for example Pinto
and Valiant, the days' supply exceeded 100, apparently necessitating
cutbacks in production schedules.
Total new orders for durable goods rose 2.1 per cent in July.
In real terms, however, orders fell slightly, following declines in
the first two quarters. (Table 1) The composite index of leading indicators
also rose sharply in July. But the Boston FRB index of deflated leading
indicators fell .5 per cent--the third decline in the past four months.
(Table 2)
Recent indicators of business fixed capital spending reflect
divergent trends. New orders for nondefense capital goods rose in
July in real as well as nominal terms, and revised data now show a
moderate rise in real orders for the second quarter. Order
backlogs expanded further. Moreover, capital appropriations of large
manufacturing companies rose at a record rate in the second quarter
(according to the Conference Board). Strength was concentrated in
the capacity-short materials industries. (Table 3) About half of the rise was
in the petroleum industry and the balance came mainly from producers of

II -4
chemicals and nonferrous metals. However, the Conference Board
anticipates on the basis of a limited number of returns for the third
quarter that appropriations for capital spending may have reached their
peak.
Outside of the materials producing sector, there have been
increasing reports that tight financial conditions, rising costs, and
depressed demand have led to a reexamination of capital spending plans.
In manufacturing, the motor vehicles industry has scaled down spending
plans; and some other firms also have made cut-backs. In nonmanu-
facturing, some additional reductions in planned outlays have recently
been announced by the electric utilities, and there have also been
increasing reports of further weakness in commercial construction in
many parts of the country.
Book value of manufacturing inventories jumped sharply in
July, exceeding the second quarter average monthly rate of increase,
but this probably reflects the extraordinarily rapid rise in prices
in recent months. It is not now anticipated that there will be much
change in nonfarm inventory accumulation on a GNP basis in the third
quarter.

II -5
Despite overall sluggishness, there is still a good deal of
intended inventory accumulation. Coal is being stockpiled in anticipa-
tion of a strike on November 12. Businessmen apparently are also
continuing to stock some materials and components, partly in anticipation
of further price increases.
However, the ratio of inventories to GNP final sales in
constant dollars is very high suggesting a significant amount of
involuntary investment. There are persistent reports that many firms
are becoming more cautious and are making strong efforts to prevent
further accumulation, as delivery times shorten and shortages ease.
Newspaper reports over the past few weeks have reported that some
companies in the electronics, glass, auto, home appliances, and rubber
industries plan to or have already laid off workers in order to reduce
current large backlogs of inventories.
Private housing starts were down sharply in July, to a level
more than two-fifths below the high in the first quarter of 1973--
the largest drop in starts in the post World War II period. Prospects
are that the third quarter average will, at best, approximate 1.4
million units--the smallest number for any quarter in over four years.
So far, the decline in starts this year has been concentrated in multi-
family units. In July these were at the lowest level since mid-1967
and accounted for only 30 per cent of the total, compared with two-
fifths in other recent years.
Prospects for halting some further decline in residential
construction activity appear to have diminished. There has been

II -6
further deterioration in net depositary inflows at savings institutions,
and interest rates have risen still more for both construction loans
and permanent financing. Mortgage lenders have cut back new commitment
activity appreciably. In addition, there is still an exceptionally
large number of units under construction or in builders' completed
inventories.
The rise in consumer prices moderated in July because of a
fall in retail food prices and a smaller advance for energy items.
The August index, however, is expected to rebound, reflecting a sharp
reversal in meat prices--wholesale farm prices climbed in both July
and August. Most nonfood commodities in July rose at an accelerated
pace following earlier and continued advances at wholesale. Service
prices have also been rising at a steadily increasing rate, as mortgage
rates, medical costs, and gas and electricity have continued to climb.
(See Table 4.)
Prices received by farmers during the month ending August 15
increased 3 per cent. With expected production cut by drought, feed
grain prices moved sharply higher. Since mid-August, however, grain
prices have declined moderately in response to some slackening in
domestic and foreign demand.
The FR price index for industrial materials (not for publi-
cation) has declined recently, although it is still nearly 30 per cent
above a year ago. Reductions in spot prices since July include copper

II -7
and steel scrap, cotton, cotton printcloth, lumber, and plywood. Most
of these--steel scrap is a notable exception--are below year-ago levels.
Major automobile manufacturers have announced increases on
1975-model automobiles averaging about 8 per cent. Safety and pollu-
tion control equipment included in these increases account for less than
3 per cent of the increase. Part of the advance may be reflected in
the September consumer price index, as the new models are reaching
dealers for sale earlier than usual.
Recent and prospective rises in consumer prices have heightened
labor efforts to maintain purchasing power. Wage rates in August are
likely to have continued their upward momentum; increases negotiated in
the communications industry became effective and workers in the steel,
can, aluminum, and clothing industry received large cost-of-living raises.
In the previous three months the average hourly earnings index had
advanced 10 per cent, with gains somewhat above the average in manu-
facturing.
Wage negotiations have begun in the soft coal industry, with
the contract scheduled to expire November 12. The rank and file will
vote on the contract for the first time. This is likely to put
additional pressure on the new union president to push for a large
settlement. It is generally believed that a strike of considerable
duration could take place and, therefore, substantial stockpiling of
coal is now under way. Another important challenge to the wage

II -8
structure is scheduled to take place when railroad contracts covering
some 500,000 workers expire at the end of December; announced union
demands are extraordinarily large.
The impact of the newly established Council of Wage and Price
Stability remains uncertain. Its major function will be to spotlight
price and wage increases which are deemed to be excessive. Since it
has no enforcement powers, the Council will have to rely mainly on
persuasion to limit prospective price increases or wage demands.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL SECTORS
Monetary aggregates. Preliminary data suggest that M1 and M2
increased more rapidly in August than in July, but the growth rate of
M1 in August is estimated to be considerably below the second quarter
pace of 6-1/2 per cent. Time and savings deposits other than negotiable
CD's are estimated to have grown at near the 9.5 per cent rate of July,
slightly above the second quarter pace. Outflows of savings deposits
continue, and there is a presumption that large denomination time deposits
other than negotiable CD's at weekly reporters are accounting for most
of the sustained strength in other time deposits. Continued weakness in
thrift institution deposits in August is expected to have reduced growth in
M3 to about a 4.5 per cent rate.
With loan growth moderating, and the total of private and U.S.
Government demand deposits expanding rapidly in August, large banks
increased their outstanding CD's less than seasonally, and significantly
less than in July; in addition, banks reduced, on daily average, their
use of nondeposit sources of funds. As in July, banks outside of New
York and Chicago increased their outstanding CD's by a relatively large
amount, suggesting that, at least in the aggregate, regional bank ability
to issue such instruments is not being constrained.
Bank credit. Preliminary data suggests that growth in bank
credit so far in the third quarter, after adjustment for sale-purchase

III -2
transactions with the Trading Desk,1/ has continued at the slower pace
that began late in the second quarter. Before such adjustments, growth
in August (on an end-of-month basis) was close to the second quarter
pace of 11-1/2 per cent. Despite bank acquisitions of coupon issues
in the August refunding, holdings of Treasury securities on a seasonally
adjusted basis are expected to show little over-all change in August;
other security holdings are also expected to be about unchanged.
Business loan expansion in August is projected to be relatively
large, although for the third consecutive month it is likely to be
several percentage points below the first half pace of 23 per cent.
The slowing of business loan expansion this summer has reflected not
only a general tightening of bank loan policies, and possibly reduced
inventory acquisitions, but also a prime rate that has remained high
in relation to rates on commercial paper, which may have encouraged
some prime borrowers to shift to the open market. However, total
short-term borrowing of businesses appears to have moderated in August.
Food processors, textiles, and durables manufacturing--particularly
machinery and transportation equipment--accounted for most of the business
loan growth at large banks. For the first time since early this year,
public utilities reduced bank loans in August, possibly with proceeds
from market financing.
1/ Sale-purchase transactions inflate security loans as dealers
increase their borrowing to finance the securities they purchase
from the Desk.

III -3
Although growth in dealer-placed commercial paper appears
to have slowed from the July pace, and outstanding bank-related paper
is expected to decline sharply, finance companies increased their
outstanding commercial paper, using the proceeds in part to repay
bank loans.
Nonbank financial intermediaries and mortgage markets. Sample
data indicate that both savings and loan associations and mutual savings
banks experienced large deposit losses on an unadjusted basis in August.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, growth of thrift institution deposits is
estimated to have been at about a 1 per cent annual rate or slightly
worse than the weak July experience. To obtain funds for meeting deposit
withdrawals and outstanding commitments, S&L's and MSB's reportedly
continued to rely mainly on repayment flows, reductions in liquid assets,
and for S&L's borrowing from the FHLBanks. S&L borrowings from FHLBanks
is estimated to have been about $1 billion in August, up from the $875
million average monthly pace in June and July.
Seasonally adjusted outstanding mortgage commitments at savings
and loan associations and New York mutual savings banks declined further
in July to the lowest level since November 1971. New mortgage commitments
at these institutions also dropped again in July and were only 45 per
cent of the combined volume posted in April of this year, according to
Federal Reserve estimates. Furthermore, S&L's continued to report
funds in short supply in all 12 of the FHLBank Districts throughout August.

III -4
Average interest rates on new commitments for 80 per cent
conventional home loans at selected S&L's rose by 27 basis points
during August to 9.74 per cent--134 basis points above the recent
low in March. These rates are above usury ceilings in 16 states but
below the yields on new issues of high-grade utility bonds. Average
yields on accepted bids in the August 26 FNMA auction rose to 10.38
per cent on FHA/VA mortgages and to 10.42 per cent on high loan-to-
value ratio conventional home mortgages--almost 2 percentage points
above the March lows.
Delinquency rates on home mortgages (MBA series) edged up
in the second quarter, after seasonal adjustment, to 4.34 per cent
of outstanding loans held by reporting institutions--a new high for
the series.
The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, signed
into law August 22, contains a number of provisions designed to aid
home construction. These include extension of all basic FHA programs
to October 1977, increases in the maximum size of FHA-insured home loans,
decreases in the downpayment requirements on such loans, and increases
in the maximum size of home mortgage loans by Federal S&L's.
Consumer credit. Finance rates on consumer instalment loans
have advanced sharply since the Economic Stabilization Act expired at
the end of April. At commercial banks, the average rate for direct
new car loans in July rose to 10.94 per cent, up 13 basis points from

III -5
June, and 43 basis points above the level that prevailed in April.
Finance company rates on new-car contracts have shown an upsurge of
similar magnitude since April.
The delinquency rate on auto loans at major finance companies
(contracts delinquent over 30 days as a percent of total accounts)
declined to 2.63 per cent in June from the near-record high of 2.75
per cent in May. Refinancings also declined in June, but both
delinquencies and refinancings are well above their year-earlier
levels of 2.31 per cent and 1.12 per cent, respectively.
Securities markets. After the August FOMC meeting, most
private rates rose by another 1/8 of a percentage point or so, while
rates on Treasury bills jumped 60 basis points or more to new highs.
Subsequently, however, most rates declined, largely in response to
the recent decline in the Federal funds rate below the 12 per cent
level and the growing market belief that monetary policy may have
eased to come extent. Currently, a number of short-term rates are
close to their levels at the time of the August FOMC meeting, but
bill rates remain 30-40 basis points higher while CD rates are
appreciably lower.

III -6
The initial sharp rise in Treasury bill rates was prompted
mainly by further sizable increases in the supply of bills. The
Treasury raised $400 million of new money in the weekly bill auctions
on August 26 and August 30 and auctioned $2.0 billion of June 1975
bills on August 28. Also, there were $3.0 billion of Federal Financing
Bank bills and September TABs sold in late July and early August, as
well as previous increases in the weekly bill auctions. As a result,
the spread between bill rates and private rates has narrowed signifi-
cantly towards more normal levels.
While rates on Government coupon issues, recently offered
corporate bonds, and municipal bonds have tended to edge down in the
last few days, these rates are up appreciably from the levels prevailing
at the time of the August FOMC meeting--by 15 to 30 basis points on
most issues, Earlier upward pressures on these rates came from the
relatively large size of Government dealer inventories, rising short-
term rates, and sizable current and prospective demands in longer-term
markets. In the corporate market, underwriters report that pension and
trust accounts in general have diverted an increasing portion of their
funds to bonds and away from equities. In addition, these investors
appear to have sizable short-term investment positions.
The total volume of public and private corporate security
offerings in August was slightly less than the monthly average for
the first half of the year. Public bond offerings were unseasonally
heavy despite $250 million of postponements, cancellations, and

III -7
reductions in size of previously scheduled issues. This amount
includes $95 million of reductions in the size of floating rate note
offerings, which have been receiving a mixed reaction in the market.
The volume of private placements and stock offerings, however, was
relatively small, reflecting in part policy loan drains from life
insurance companies and a sharp drop in stock prices.
Total corporate security offerings, bolstered by a seasonal
increase in private placements and a higher projected level of stock
offerings, are projected to increase in September but then decline
seasonally in October. The level of public bond offerings is expected
to remain high, and underwriters report a heavy backlog of potential
borrowers who will need long-term financing later in the year.
Municipal offerings in the coming months are expected to show an
appreciable increase from the seasonally low $1.1 billion volume in
August, which was held down by high interest rates and postponements or
reductions in size of scheduled offerings. Borrowing by Federally
sponsored agencies, which currently are expected to require $6.4
billion of new funds over the last four months of this year, will be
adding to pressures in securities markets. In 1973 new money needs of
the Federal agencies were $1 billion less than projected this year and
in earlier years the volume was smaller.

Federal finance. On the basis of the new Administration's
budget plans, the staff has cut fiscal year 1975 budget outlays by $5
billion since the last Greenbook to a level of $299.5 billion. The
details of the Administration approach are still to be worked out in
consultation with Congressional leaders. In our estimates, $2.6
billion of the decline occurs in purchases of goods and services,
where the projection is now consistent with recent Senate cuts in
defense appropriations and with the Administration's proposal to post-
pone the Federal pay raise from October this year to January 1975.
Spending estimates also were lowered for grants to States and local
governments, partly reflecting a later phase-in of the assumed expansion
in public service employment program which is now unlikely to start
until the spring of 1975. A portion of the remaining spending cut was
allocated to asset sales and timing shifts between fiscal year 1975 and 1976.
Staff projections of budget receipts for fiscal year 1975 amount
to $293.3 billion, so that a $6.2 billion deficit is now estimated.

2/ The sum of sponsored and budget agency debt issues, financial asset sales, and borrowing by the
Federal Financing Bank does not necessarily reflect the volume of debt absorbed by the public,
since both the sponsored and budget agencies acquire a portion of these issues. Most of the
market activities of budget agencies are expected to be handled by the Federal Financing Bank
in fiscal year 1975.

sales are netted against Federal Budget Outlays shown above.
4/ Budget agencies such as U.S. Postal Service, Export-Import Bank, and Tennessee Valley Authority,
borrow directly from the public or from the Federal Financing Bank. The Federal Financing Bank
in turn borrows from the public or from the Treasury. To avoid double counting only net borrowing
from the public is shown in the table.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange and Euro-dollar markets. The dollar appreciated
by nearly 3 per cent on a weighted average basis against leading foreign
currencies during August, with somewhat larger gains against most European
currencies and smaller gains against the Canadian dollar and the yen.
Central banks of the G-10 countries sold some $3/4 billion in August,
moderating the dollar's advance. Principal factors behind the dollar's
strength included renewed market expectations that OPEC countries would
invest increasing proportions of their revenues in dollars, continued market
apprehension over the problems of the German banking system, and the increas-
ingly gloomy outlook for the economy of the United Kingdom.
The German mark showed particular weakness in the exchanges in
August, and was supported by central bank purchases of marks against dollars
to the extent of $272 million and against other snake currencies to the
extent of over $400 million equivalent. The Japanese yen was also under
substantial downward pressure. The Bank of Japan sold nearly $460 million
to support its currency.
Euro-dollar deposit rates have shown divergent movements in the
past three weeks, and a further widening of the gap between very short-
term rates and rates on longer maturities. The 3-month rate resumed its
upward movement, reaching an average of 13.8 per cent in the week of
September 4 (after briefly exceeding 14 per cent in late August), and the
excess of the 3-month rate over the 60-89 day CD rate widened to about 2.4
per cent. The overnight rate declined to 11.2 per cent in the latest week.

IV -2
U.S. banks further increased their gross liabilities to their
foreign branches to an average of $4.3 billion in the week of August 28,
up from $4.1 billion three weeks before, although there was a sharp inter-
vening decline.
U.S. balance of payments. Preliminary data indicate that U.S.
liabilities to foreign official institutions declined by about $3/4 billion
in August after increasing in each of the previous five months. Oil-exporting
countries continued to add to their official U.S. assets, but other central
banks, notably in Japan and Germany, sold dollars in more than offsetting
amounts. Also,U.S. reserve assets increased in August by about $600 million,
as a result mainly of a drawing by the Bank of Mexico of $180 million on its
swap line with the Federal Reserve and an Italian drawing of dollars from
the International Monetary Fund which increased the U.S. reserve position
in the Fund.
There appears to have been a fairly strong net inflow of private
capital during August, particularly through U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks. These inflows must have more than offset the deficit on
current account.
There is still little detailed information available about trans-
actions in July. Nearly all of the official settlements deficit of $1
billion can probably be attributed to inflows of official funds from oil-
exporting countries. U.S. liabilities to official Japanese agencies were
reduced as the Japanese Ministry of Finance increased their dollar deposits
with Japanese commercial banks by $450 million, In July there was a net

IV -3
inflow of short term bank reported capital for the first month since January.
Bank lending to foreigners, about $1-1/4 billion, was only half the monthly
average rate of the second quarter even though bank acceptance credits
(particularly to Japan) which are included in these claims on foreigners,
rose to record levels. And there was an increase of $2 billion in liabilities
to private foreigners reported by U.S. banks in July. The July trade
balance, as described below, was in deficit by $3/4 billion, not annual rate,
primarily reflecting increased petroleum imports.
U.S. Merchandise trade. In July the U.S. trade balance showed
a large deficit of $9.4 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate), about
equal to the average deficit for May-June -- as compared to a average deficit
rate of only $0.6 billion in the first four months of 1974. The marked worsen-
ing in the trade deficit in recent months can be attributed to continued
large increases in fuel imports and some decline in agricultural exports,
with unusually large declines in aircraft exports in May and July also con-
tributing to the large deficits in those months. In contrast to the total
trade deficit, the deficit excluding agricultural exports and fuel imports
for May-July was unchanged from the $2 billion deficit rate in the preceding
four months.
The value of fuel imports in May-July was nearly 30 per cent higher
than the January-April average, with about two-thirds of the increase attri-
butable to higher prices. In July, however, there was a sharp rise in import
volume -- to nearly 7 million barrels per day, compared with less than 6-1/2
million barrels per day in each of the preceding three months -- reflecting,

IV -4
in part, an increase in stocks of petroleum products. Prices of oil
imports in July held fairly steady at than April-June level i.e.,
slightly over $11.60 per barrel. With stocks now at a very high level
and domestic consumption of oil relatively constant, it is unlikely
that the high volume of oil imports in July will be sustained.
Agricultural exports have declined in both volume and unit
value since April. Agricultural export prices recovered slightly in
July; this rise, however, was still too soon to reflect the recent
run-up in U.S. agricultural prices, and further large rises in these
export prices can be expected. Nonagricultural exports and nonfuel
imports have both risen by about 20 per cent over the first seven months
of 1974. All of the increased value in nonfuel imports and about two-
thirds of the increase in nonagricultural exports were attributable to
higher prices.
Petroleum. A substantial world oil surplus developed during
the second quarter of 1974, with free world oil supplies exceeding con-
sumption at current prices by around 3 million barrels a day (6 per cent)
in June. Storage tanks almost everywhere are full, and sizable quanities
of oil are, in effect, in storage at sea in tankers steaming at below-
normal speeds or queuing up to unload.
Any hopes for a decisive break in prices, however, have been
disappointed as the OPEC countries have reacted since June by cutting
back production rather than by offering large amounts of oil in the
auction market.. Recent substantial cuts in output have occurred in

IV -5
Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. For the longer run, Iran and
Nigeria have asked the producing companies to scale down their expansion
plans.
Total OPEC petroleum output in August was at a rate 5 per cent
lower than the 1973 average. Percentage cuts in output have been parti-
cularly large this year in Libya and Kuwait, where August output was 45
and 31 per cent, respectively, below 1973 average rates. Other OPEC
countries producing less in August than in 1973 on average included
Algeria and Venezuela (15 per cent) and Iraq and Qatar (9 per cent).
While there have been increases from average 1973 levels in the United
Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria, and Indonesia, the tendency
in most of these countries, too, is now to cut back (as in Saudi Arabia)
or slow expansion.
Ministers of OPEC countries will meet in September to consider
future pricing and perhaps a more systematic sharing of curbs on output.
The economic situation in the United Kingdom. The air of
gloom surrounding the British economy is thickening. There are many
major problems facing Britain, and there is a lack of confidence in the
present Government's -- or any Government's -- ability to solve them.
As can be seen in the table below, prices and wages have been rising
at high and accelerating rates, and upward pressure on wages is likely
to increase further. Output in the second quarter -- though presumably
recovered from the electricity cutbacks in the first quarter -- remained
below the average level of the second half of last year, and is likely

to be fairly flat for the next several quarters. Unemployment has been
rising. The latest forecast by the National Institute for Economic and
Social Research -- published at the end of August -- shows real GNP rising
by less than 1 per cent between the second halves of 1974 and 1975, with
the number of unemployed rising to 900,000 by the end of next year. Some
other forecasts paint an even weaker picture.
On the external side, the current account deficit is likely to
be over £4 billion, or about $10 billion, this year -- roughly 6 per cent
of British GDP. In the first 7 months of this year, the trade deficit
(S.A.) averaged £449 billion, compared to an average monthly deficit of
£198 million last year. The bulk of that deterioration has represented

IV -7
the increase in the deficit on petroleum trade. Indeed, one of the
few relatively favorable aspects of the British economic situation
is that the deficit on non-oil trade has been declining this year,
after reaching a peak at the end of last year.
So far Britain has been able to finance its large current
account deficit with little change either in the effective exchange
rate of sterling since July 1973 or in the level of official reserves.
A sizable part of the deficit reflects imports of equipment needed to
exploit North Sea oil resources, and these imports have largely been
financed by direct investment inflows. In addition, foreign liabili-
ties have increased considerably, largely reflecting foreign currency
borrowing by the local authorities and nationalized industries (amount-
ing to $1.9 billion in the first eight months of this year, and $2.5
billion last year), and increased holdings of sterling assets by oil
companies and oil exporting countries.
