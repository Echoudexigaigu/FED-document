Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that 
material was received on a confidential ba sis.  Redacted material is indicated by 
occasional gaps in the text or by gray boxe s around non-text content.  All redacted

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Signs of a slowing in the recent rapid pace of economic
recovery have become prevalent in the last several weeks. In October,
increases in industrial production and nonfarm employment were more
modest than in earlier months. However, retail sales strengthened,
and unit auto sales improved.
Liquidation of business inventories may now be at an end,
and some accumulation seems likely in the fourth quarter. However,
business capital spending remains depressed and the near-term outlook
is questionable in view of the weakness in orders for nondefense
capital goods. The longer-term outlook appears better if the private
surveys of investment plans are adjusted for the downward bias generally
experienced in the early periods of recovery.
Wholesale prices rose sharply in October, with both foods and
industrials higher. Wage rates also increased substantially. However,
recent declines in basic commodity prices and the cyclical improvement
in unit labor costs stemming from rising productivity should help to
moderate the increase in prices in the coming months.
Industrial production is estimated to have risen about 1/2
per cent in October--substantially less than the previous four monthly
increases, in the 1 to 2 per cent range. Production of business
equipment, which rose slightly in August and September, apparently
edged down a bit in October reflecting weakness in output of heavy
machinery and large trucks. Production of consumer goods other than

II -2
autos--both durable and nondurable--continued to expand in October.
Auto assemblies rose 3 per cent to a 7.7 million unit annual rate.
Production of materials appears to have risen a bit in
October--mainly in nondurables. Output of raw steel was down about
5 per cent, following a 6-1/2 per cent rise in September prior to an
October 1 price increase. Capacity utilization in major materials
industries moved up only slightly as the drop in steel production nearly
offset a strong increase in the nondurables in this group.
Total unit auto sales rose about 3 per cent to a 9.2 million
unit annual rate; sales of domestic units rose to 7.8 million, annual
rate--the highest level so far this year. Sales of foreign models
declined from 1.7 million units to 1.4 million in October, possibly
reflecting supply shortages. However, the initial impact of improved
mileage of domestic autos and the new sub-compact recently introduced
by General Motors may also have been factors. Retail sales, ex autos
and nonconsumer items, rose about 1-1/4 per cent in October. Most of
the increase came from the food group, reversing a previous dip in
that category.
Indicators of business fixed capital spending continue to
provide a mixed pattern. In September(p), new orders for nondefense
capital goods declined for the second month in a row with orders
received by the electrical machinery industries off sharply. On the
other hand, contracts for commercial industrial buildings (measured

II -3
in square feet) rose 16 per cent in September, reversing an 18 per
cent drop in August. While this volatile series remains far below its
recent highs, it may now have bottomed out. Much of the September
increase was in the manufacturing sector which had been a source of
weakness in recent months.
The recent McGraw-Hill survey of planned capital spending
indicates a 9 per cent rise for 1976 following this year's 1 per cent
gain in nominal terms. But McGraw-Hill also reports that respondents
expected prices to increase by about 9 per cent, thus implying no gain
in real investment. However, in past recoveries, private surveys
have tended to underpredict spending increases by about 5-6 percentage
points. All of the surveys now available suggest that the relative
strength in 1976 will be centered in the nondurable manufacturing,
electric utilities and communications sectors.
Liquidation of inventories appears to be coming to an end.
The book value of retail trade inventories has risen from June to
August. Wholesale trade inventories rose at a $2.3 billion annual
rate in September, for the second month in a row. The decline in the
book value of manufacturers' inventories in September was only $1.0
billion, annual rate, compared to the $6.2 billion annual rate decrease
for the third quarter as a whole, and the $12.5 billion drop in the
second quarter. Inventories of nondurable goods producers rose in
September for the second consecutive month, while stocks of producers'

II -4
durable goods continued to decline--but at a less rapid pace than
before. Over half the September runoff was accounted for by producers
of steel, where shipments surged in anticipation of the October 1
price hike.
Private housing starts in September held close to the August
level and were up 17 per cent for the third quarter as a whole.
Multi-family starts rose by more than a third--the first significant
increase in almost three years--while starts of single-family dwellings
advanced by about 12 per cent. Building permits rose in September and
were up by 15 per cent in the third quarter, following a 30 per cent
increase in the second. Outstanding mortgage loan commitments also
advanced in September. These indicators suggest some further recovery
of housing over the near-term. Additionally, the Administration has
announced reactivation of an interest-rate subsidy program for low and
moderate income families effective January 5, 1976.1/
Nonfarm employment continued to advance in October although
the net increase (217,000) and the number of industries that increased
employment (about 63 per cent of the 172 industries) were below that
of other recent months. Nondurable manufacturing (up 82,000) and
1/ This program (FHA Section 235, revised) releases $264 million in
previously appropriated funds for subsidizing mortgage interest
payments on over 250,000 new or substantially rehabilitated
dwellings. These HUD payments could reduce the homeowners' mortgage
interest costs to as low as 5 per cent. While final regulations are
not scheduled for release until January 1, 1976, units on which work
was begun after October 17, 1975 could qualify under the program.

II -5
services (up 48,000) recorded the largest advances in October. Settle-
ment of strikes accounted for over half of the 62,000 increase in
State and local government employment. Average weekly hours were
unchanged in manufacturing but rose slightly in trade, services and
finance.
The total unemployment rate showed an increase of 0.3 to
8.6 per cent in October. Some or all of this increase appears to
reflect seasonal adjustment problems. Use of an alternative seasonal
adjustment technique, suggests little change over the month. Taking
all programs into account, the number of insured unemployed continued
to drift downward during October. However, initial claims for
unemployment compensation remain relatively high, and have levelled
off since July, after dropping sharply between February and June.
The average hourly earnings index, which adjusts for inter-
industry shifts in employment and manufacturing overtime, rose 11 per
cent (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in October, following a 3 per
cent increase in September. When the monthly volatility in this
series is smoothed out, it appears that the index has been rising
at about an 8 per cent annual rate.
Wage rate adjustments in third quarter major collective
bargaining agreements(which covered only 800,000 out of the 10.3
million workers under major contracts) averaged 10 per cent for the
first contract year compared to about 11 per cent in the first half.

II -6
Settlements reached so far this year have provided slightly larger
first-year wage gains than those negotiated during all of 1974.
Output per hour in the private nonfarm economy is estimated
to have risen sharply in the third quarter (9.4 per cent at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate)--the second consecutive quarterly gain and the
largest increase since 1961. The third quarter movement is the result
of a large--and possibly overstated--rise in overall output combined
with a modest increase in hours worked. In manufacturing, productivity
rose at an 8.9 per cent annual rate.
The sharp rise in private nonfarm productivity resulted in
the first quarterly decline in unit labor costs since 1972. These
costs fell at an 0.8 per cent annual rate in the third quarter, following
a 1.9 per cent rate of increase in the second quarter and an average
13 per cent rise in the previous 5 quarters. Manufacturing unit labor
costs also declined in the third quarter--by about 1 per cent, annual
rate.
Wholesale prices rose 1.8 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in
October to a level 5 per cent above a year earlier. Once again, the
rise in the total index exceeded the rise of the component parts.
Industrial commodities prices, which have been rising more rapidly
in recent months, jumped 1.2 per cent in October following a 0.7 per
cent September increase. While much of the more rapid October rise

II -7
was due to introduction of new model cars, higher prices for metals--
especially steel--along with textiles and fuel and power also were
important. Prices of farm and food products rose sharply further,by
1.7 per cent, following a 2.3 per cent increase in September. Large
increases occurred in dairy products, animal feeds and poultry. Since
the mid-October pricing date there have been substantial declines in
prices for many agricultural products.
The seasonally adjusted consumer price index rose 0.5 per
cent in September as compared to 0.2 per cent in August. Prices of
foods were about unchanged for the second month while nonfood commodities
prices rose 0.3 per cent. Costs of services jumped 1 per cent, however,
boosted partly by the rise in New York City transit fares. Costs of
gas and electricity, fuel oil and medical services also rose rapidly.
The probability of a default by New York City now appears
considerably greater than a month ago. In the event of a default,
even if the city were allowed to bypass debt service payments, receipts
from taxes and other sources would still fall short of spending needs
by about $1.25 billion over the next 4 months. This excess in
expenditures will require a massive round of expenditure cutting if
some program of Federal aid is not enacted. And while this deficiency
is small relative to the $227 billion total of State and local govern-
ment spending, a retrenchment of spending outside of New York City

II -8
is an increased likelihood because of constraints developing in
financial markets. So far the reports of major impacts have been
confined largely to the Northeast.
The staff is now projecting a unified Federal budget deficit
of approximately $69 billion for FY 1976. The current estimate of
outlays remains unchanged at $370 billion, and Federal tax receipts
are now estimated at about $301 billion for FY 1976. Our estimates
assume an extension of the current tax rate during 1976 and thus are
to a large degree consistent with provisions recently adopted by the
House Ways and Means Committee.
The Administration has recently revised the budget projections
for FY 1976. The deficit for the current fiscal year is now estimated
at about $69 billion, with receipts of $298 billion and outlays of
approximately $367 billion. It should be noted, however, that the
Administration estimates of receipts reflects the President's recent
tax reduction proposals. Moreover, the revised outlay forecast
assumes favorable Congressional action on $3.6 billion of previously
proposed expenditure reductions. If these reductions are disallowed,
the Administration forecast implies FY 1976 expenditures of $370
billion.
On a high employment basis, the staff is projecting a decline
in fiscal stimulus from a deficit of about $36 billion (annual rate)

II -9
in the second quarter of CY 1975 to one of $11 billion in the last
half of the year. The full employment deficit continues at about this
level in the first half of CY 1976.
These estimates reflect recent revisions in the calculation
of the high employment budget, the details of which are discussed in
the Greenbook Appendix B.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The rallies in private and U.S. Government securities
markets which began in early October have continued into November.
Moreover, home mortgage rates in the primary market have edged down
since the October FOMC meeting and yields in the secondary mortgage
market have dropped sharply. Municipal bond yields, on the other hand,
have risen in recent weeks to near-record levels. Developments in
the municipal market have had some impacts on other financial markets
as investor preference for quality has intensified.
M1 declined at nearly a 3 per cent annual rate in October,
while total consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks and non-
bank thrift institutions rose somewhat more rapidly than in September.
Nonfinancial businesses increased their borrowing at banks and reduced
their borrowing in the commercial paper market by roughly equal amounts.
Household demands for consumer and home-mortgage credit remained strong,
and S&L's became somewhat less cautious about making mortgage commit-
ments as the outlook for savings inflows improved.
Short-term securities markets. Yields on private short-
term credit instruments generally have fallen 20 to 40 basis points
since the October FOMC meeting, and those on Treasury bills have
declined 35 to 65 points. From their late-September peaks, short-
term rates have now dropped 75 to 150 basis points. This sustained
rally reflects to a considerable extent adjustments to the decline in
the Federal funds rate--which has fallen since early October from around

6-3/8 per cent to around 5-1/4 per cent. In general, market partici-
pants have concluded that the drop in the funds rate reflects the
System's response to the shortfall in the monetary aggregates and the
uncertainty being generated by the New York City financial crisis.
These developments, along with the recent indications of a slower pace
of economic growth, have convinced many participants that credit demands
accompanying the expansion in general economic activity are unlikely
to produce significant upward pressures on interest rates over the re-
mainder of this year.
The money markets have been appreciably affected by increased
investor preference for quality. In the bill market, dealers report
retail demand from buyers who normally invest in private short-term
instruments.¹ Dealers also report that some investors are shying
away from the CD's of certain large New York City banks, and that
yields on these instruments have risen relative to rates on CD's of
major banks outside New York City. In the commercial paper market,
where a substantial shift to the highest-rated paper occurred last
year, some investors who in the past have preferred bank holding
company obligations are reported to be moving into high quality non-
bank-related paper.
Long-term securities markets. The general easing of money
market conditions and the growing investor preference for less risky
instruments has contributed to a further decline in yields in the
Treasury coupon market. Shorter-term coupon yields have fallen 35
1/ The bill market also benefited from heavy buying by foreign central
banks during October--nearly $1.4 billion net in the second half of the
month. This was a sharp reversal of the equally heavy foreign selling
that occurred in September.

to 50 basis points since the October FOMC meeting, returning to their
mid-June levels, while longer-term rates have declined by 10 to 20
basis points. In the November refunding, which raised $1.1 billion
of new money, the Treasury took advantage of the improved market con-
ditions to lengthen its debt; it sold $2.5 billion of 7-year notes and
$1.0 billion of a reopened 8-3/8 per cent bond due in nearly 25 years.
The issues were well received, with an auction average of 8.23 per
cent for the bond--21 basis points below the average when this issue
was first auctioned 3 months earlier. Good progress has been made in
the distribution of the notes, although the bond issue has been moving
more slowly. Moreover, while the note yield has been falling since the
auction, the yield on the bonds--which were bid for quite aggressively--
1/has shown little change.¹
Gross issues of publicly-offered bonds by domestic corpora-
tions totaled $2.3 billion in October, a sizable increase from the
$1.4 billion recorded in August as well as September. Although to
some extent seasonal, the increase also was in response to the sharp
decline in long-term bond yields that has occurred since the end of
September. New issues by industrial corporations during October
surpassed utility offerings for the first month since July, with non-
prime issues (A-rated or below) accounting for nearly three-fifths of
the aggregate volume. This larger than usual share of lower-rated
1/ Estimates of Treasury borrowing needs over the balance of the year
remain unchanged from the October Greenbook, and Treasury financing is
expected to be concentrated in bills. Estimated Federal agency re-
quirements have been revised downward, due to expected reduced demands
by housing-related agencies.

issues implies that the corporate market has largely escaped any adverse
spillover effect from recent municipal market developments.
Foreign bond offerings in domestic capital markets were quite
small in October; however, they are expected to increase to a record
$950 million during November in the wake of the recent decline in rates
in U.S. bond markets. Canadian public and private corporations, which
traditionally finance in the U.S. market, account for the bulk of
this volume. New bond issues by domestic corporations are expected
to fall to only $1.8 billion in November, due in part to the competi-
tion from foreign issues.
New stock offerings by corporations, buoyed by a $550
million issue by AT&T, totaled $1.5 billion during October--the largest
volume in over two and one-half years. Public utilities continued to
account for the bulk of these issues; a number of utilities have been
restructuring their balance sheets, in many cases selling equities
below book value. Major stock market price indexes have shown little
over-all change since the October FOMC meeting. However, share prices
of the major New York bank holding companies fell, on average, by
approximately 6 per cent over this period as investors continued to
be concerned about the impact on bank earnings of a New York City
default and prospective losses on loans to REITs.
During the inter-meeting period, average yields on long-term
municipal securities declined initially--along with other market rates.
But recently, as a New York City default began to be viewed as a
virtual certainty, municipal bond yields have moved up close to the

III -7
historic highs of early October, reflecting a further increase in the
differential between yields on highest-rated and lower-rated securities
to an all-time high. The market for new higher quality municipal
issues has continued to function fairly well and the volume of securit-
ies distributed has remained substantial.
Monetary aggregates. In October, M1 declined on a daily
average basis to about its August level, following three months of very
slow growth. While weakness in the third quarter may have reflected
in part portfolio adjustments in response to the earlier large spurt
in demand deposits associated with tax rebates and special social
security payments, the continuation of weakness into the fourth quarter
has been puzzling. The recent pattern suggests that M1 growth measured
on a quarterly average basis will be relatively slow during the fourth
quarter.
Growth of the more broadly defined money stock measures--M2
and M3--slowed slightly in October, but this was due primarily to the
contraction in M1. Expansion in time and savings deposits other than
large CD's at commercial banks picked up somewhat. Growth in deposits
at nonbank thrift institutions, which had been slowing from the record
rates recorded in the first half of the year, was at about the same
pace as in September. As market interest rates have declined, competi-
tive pressure on thrift institutions from market instruments has eased;
for example, noncompetitive tenders as a share of total tenders in the
three Treasury note auctions held during October were sharply below the
comparable ratios established in September's note auctions.

The build-up in outstanding CD's which began in September,
as some large banks acquired liquid assets for statement-date window
dressing and to position themselves for adverse market responses to
possible loan or security losses, ended after the first week in October.
However, after mid-month, some large banks--particularly in New York
City--sharply increased their borrowings from the Euro-dollar market
as domestic money market participants became more reluctant to invest
in their CD's. In recent weeks, many of the major institutions in New
York City were extending the maturity of their managed liabilities by
reducing borrowing from the overnight Federal funds market as well as
by lengthening the maturity of CD issues and Euro-dollar borrowings.
Loan developments. Lending by commercial banks picked up
substantially in October and accounted for all of the 6 per cent increase
in total bank credit as holdings of securities by these institutions
declined.¹ Most major types of bank loans expanded, with commercial
and industrial loans showing what appears to be the first significant
2/rise since last year.- Business loans at the largest banks continued
to be relatively weak, although not so weak as in other recent months.
1/ Bank holdings of Treasury securities, which had been rising rapidly
since January, dropped off in October. Strength in the "other securit-
ies" component at large banks was attributable mainly to a pickup in
net acquisitions of Federally-sponsored agency issues early in the month.
Moreover, some municipal tax warrants were acquired later in the month,
in some cases substituting for holdings of agency securities.
2/ Growth in business loans outstanding would have been at an annual
rate of about 11.4 per cent in the absence of large write-offs of loans
to W.T. Grant in October.

III -11
A substantial portion of the increase in commercial bank loans to
business appears to reflect lending by smaller banks to firms which have
inadequate internal funds and lack access to market financing.
Despite the sharp rise in bank loans to business, total
short-term business credit outstanding increased only modestly in
October as net issues of commercial paper by nonfinancial corporations
declined by a substantial amount for the second consecutive month. Even
though commercial paper rates have fallen by more than the bank prime
rate since early October (the spread is currently 160 basis points),
issuance of paper by nonfinancial businesses has remained limited due
to reduced cash needs of these issuers. However, total commercial
paper outstanding rose moderately in October as net issues by nonbank
financial corporations--primarily finance company subsidiaries of auto
companies and large retail stores--increased sharply.
Savings and loan associations have continued to dominate
the private mortgage market despite some pickup in net mortgage lending
at other depositary institutions. Although estimated new mortgage
commitments at S&L's fell slightly in September, outstanding commit-
ments increased further to the highest level in over 2 years. By mid-
October, S&L's in as many as 4 FHLB Districts were reporting mortgage
funds to be in short supply relative to demand, but the number has
declined since then as conditions in the money and bond markets have
continued to improve. Indeed, field reports indicate that the thrift
institutions, which are in a strong liquidity position, have become
more optimistic about the near-term course of deposit flows and less
cautious about entering into new mortgage commitments.

III -12
Average interest rates on new commitments for conventional
home mortgages at S&L's, which had been rising moderately since mid-
August, have declined slightly since the last FOMC meeting. In the
secondary market, average yields in FNMA's auctions of 4-month
commitments to purchase home mortgages fell as much as 60 basis
points in this period, after rising substantially during the previous
3 months. Demands for FNMA's commitments weakened considerably in the
most recent auctions as market expectations about future mortgage yields
were revised downward. Also, prices of GNMA-guaranteed mortgage-backed
securities rose with bond prices generally, thus making FNMA a less
attractive marketing alternative for originators of Government-underwritten
mortgages. The decline in secondary mortgage market yields has
relieved pressure on the Administration to increase the 9 per cent
ceiling rate on FHA and VA loans.
New extensions of consumer instalment credit reached a record
level in September, and the net increase in credit outstanding was the
highest for the year--an annual rate of growth of $13 billion or more
than 8 per cent. Credit unions have continued to account for the
largest share of the expansion, although a sharp turnaround from earlier
liquidation has occurred at commercial banks where credit outstanding
expanded at an annual rate of about 7 per cent in September. Auto
loans have paced the growth in total instalment credit, accounting for
two-fifths of the September increase. Maturities on auto loans showed

no further lengthening in September and interest rates on such loans
at finance companies rose somewhat after holding steady for several
months.
As the economic recovery has developed, consumers have been
able to meet their debt obligations more readily. Personal bankruptcies
declined 8 per cent during the third quarter, and were up only
9 per cent from a year ago--as compared with 30 per cent year-over-year
increases in other recent quarters. At commercial banks, during the
third quarter delinquency rates on instalment loans were well below the
near-record levels which had prevailed early in the year.

Foreign exchange markets. In the four weeks since the last
Greenbook the trade weighted value of the dollar has fluctuated within
a very narrow band of less than one per cent, and on net has declined
about 1/3 of a per cent. The dollar remains about 8 per cent above its
level in early June and about 10 per cent above its March low.
The forces tending to depress and strengthen the dollar during
the last month seem to have approximately canceled out. Among the factors
tending to weaken the dollar were: the decline in U.S. interest rates and
the expectation that this decline would continue in the near future; the
financial difficulties of New York City; and the more rapid rise of U.S.
wholesale prices. Factors tending to support the dollar included: the
announcement of another sizeable U.S. trade surplus in September, discount
rate cuts by Switzerland and Japan, the elimination of the German ban on
the issue of mark-denominated bonds by foreigners, and net purchases of
over $1.3 billion by foreign central banks.
The major purchaser of dollars during the past month was the
Bank of France which acquired about $600 million to prevent the franc
from appreciating against the mark. The central banks of Canada and
Germany also bought dollars -- $250 million and $215 million respec-
tively. No major central bank sold dollars on net during the month.
The System purchased and sold German marks during the month in
small amounts that approximately canceled out.

IV -2
Euro-dollar interest rates in the longer maturities followed
U.S. CD rates in declining 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point in the latter
part of October, but have changed little since then. Shorter maturity
Euro-dollar rates fluctuated throughout the period, with little net change.
In the last month the price of gold has fluctuated in a narrow
range between $142 and $147 per ounce. On November 12 it was $143.40,
just 65 cents above its level four weeks before.
International financial markets. According to World Bank data,
publicized medium-term Euro-credits arranged in the third quarter amounted
to $4.9 billion, slightly exceeding the second-quarter level and well above
the first-quarter volume despite seasonal factors tending to reduce third-
quarter market activity. As shown in the accompanying table, the $1.2
billion of loans arranged by borrowers in developed countries was 50 per
cent greater than in the second quarter. The increase reflected larger
borrowings by governments or firms in Britain, Ireland, and South Africa;
these increases more than compensated for a reduction in French borrowings
in the wake of French Government restrictions on the taking up of foreign
credits. U.S. companies' recourse to the market was slightly less than in
the two preceding quarters.
Credits arranged by non-oil developing countries showed another
large increase in the third quarter, to $2.6 billion, as Brazil, Greece,
Mexico and Spain stepped up their borrowings. As in 1974, for the first
nine months of 1975 Brazil and Mexico were by far the largest borrowers
in this group, and their borrowings this year have been at a slightly

higher rate than last year. Credits to oil exporters fell to $0.8 billion
in the third quarter as Indonesia, which had borrowed nearly $1 billion
in the first half, temporarily withdrew from the market, and negotiations
for a large loan to Algeria were delayed. Iraq arranged a $500 million
borrowing, its first in the medium-term Euro-credit market. Indonesia
arranged a new $300 million loan last week. Borrowings by other countries,
mostly in Eastern Europe, decreased in the third quarter; more recently,
credits to Eastern Europe picked up again in October.
Lending spreads were little changed in the third quarter, and
remained at 1-1/2 to 2 per cent over LIBO on the majority of credits although
top quality borrowers have sometimes been able to borrow at a 1-1/4 per
cent spread. Loan maturities remained almost exclusively in the 5 to 7
year range, but with some tendency toward lengthening.
In the international bond markets, new issue volume held up
well in the third quarter considering the seasonal lull in August and
the closing of the D-mark sector at the end of July. At that time the
German Central Capital Markets Committee took action that effectively pro-
hibited further D-mark issues by foreigners in either the Euro- or domestic
bond market, in order to facilitate easier monetary conditions in Germany.
This prohibition lasted until November 1. New Euro-bond issues in the
third quarter came to $2.5 billion, not greatly below the first two quarters
of the year. The proportion denominated in U.S. dollars rose sharply
from 33 per cent in the second quarter to 64 per cent in the third; this
resulted principally from the ban on D-mark issues which forced borrowers
to choose other currencies, with the rise of the dollar on the exchange

IV -5
markets also being cited as a factor. D-mark issues were 16 per cent
of the total, down from 38 per cent in the second quarter. There were
no further SDR-denominated issues.
Euro-bond yields continued to show little change in July despite
heavy new issue volume, but turned up in August and rose sharply in Sep-
tember as U.S. bond yields increased further. Yields on outstanding dollar
Euro-bonds rose 50-75 basis points between end-July and end-September to
their highest levels since the beginning of the year. Yields on D-mark
issues underwent more moderate increases as the German policy move cut
off the supply of new bonds. In the first half of October a decline in
dollar bond yields reversed about one-fourth of the August-September rise,
while D-mark yields were stable.
Foreign bond issues (i.e., foreign issues in national bond markets)
amounted to $2.6 billion in the third quarter, about equal to the second
quarter total. While issues in the German market were not possible after
July, there was a resumption of placements with monetary authorities in
OPEC countries (mainly consisting of the $100 million AT&T placement in
Saudi Arabia) and new issues in Switzerland increased about $100 million.
Foreign issues in the United States were nearly unchanged from the second
quarter at $1.3 billion, of which close to $500 million by Canadian bor-
rowers and $500 million by international organizations. As reported on page 10,
a surge in Canadian issues is expected to raise sharply the total of foreign
issues in the U.S. market in the fourth quarter.

U.S. International Transactions.
Major developments in U.S. international transactions in the
third quarter of 1975 included 1) an upturn in the volume of both
exports and imports and a continuation of the substantial trade surplus;
2) continued small net outflows through securities transactions as
increased foreign purchases of U.S. stocks offset the high rate of
foreign bond issues here; 3) a shift to net inflows through bank-reported
private capital flows; 4) a large decline in liabilities to foreign
official agencies of the non-OPEC countries, the first net outflow since
the third quarter of 1974; and 5) a stepped-up rate of inflow from the
OPEC countries. Partial data for October indicate an increase in U.S.
liabilities to foreign official agencies and a decline in liabilities to
private foreigners, reversing the third quarter pattern.
Based on actual data for merchandise trade and projections for
net service transactions, it is estimated that the U.S. current account
was in a strong surplus position in the third quarter. This surplus,
together with large reported inflows of private capital which occurred
mainly in response to a widening of differentials between U.S. and foreign
interest rates, resulted in a rise in the value of the dollar in foreign
exchange markets. The upward trend was, however, moderated -- and the
inflow of private capital accommodated -- by an increase in tne market
supply of dollars arising from foreign central bank interventions to
limit the depreciation of their currencies.

IV -7
Merchandise trade. -- In the third quarter, the United States
recorded its third consecutive quarterly surplus. The surplus of exports
over imports was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $9.1 billion
(balance of payments basis), down from the $13.4 billion rate in the
second quarter but in line with the average in the first half of 1975.

Following substantial declines in the second quarter -- especially
for imports -- U.S. exports and imports expanded in both value and volume.

IV -8
The pickup in imports was more pronounced and, to some extent, appeared
to reflect the upturn in U.S. economic activity. Although much of the
export advance consisted of agricultural commodities, shipments of non-
farm products also picked up. The latter development can, in part, be
traced to a modest strengthening in business activity in Japan and Canada
and the bottoming out of a cyclical contraction in other countries. Price
movements in the third quarter reflected the worldwide sluggishness in
demand: export prices, as measured by the unit value index, declined
slightly again, while import prices dropped for the first time in many
years.
The quarterly pattern of agricultural exports has shown wide
swings this year. The recovery in the volume of shipments in the third
quarter was stimulated by strong foreign demand stemming from a further
reduction in supplies abroad -- the world grain stock/consumption ratio,
for example, is estimated to have dropped by mid-1975 close to the
extremely low 1972/73 level -- combined with large U.S. export availabil-
ities. Even though labor disputes hampered the loading of grain shipments
to the U.S.S.R., about one-fourth of the increase in farm exports
represented shipments to that country.
The third quarter increase in nonagricultural exports was
largely confined to transportation equipment -- automotive equipment to
Canada and aircraft. Nevertheless, the volume of industrial materials
shipments leveled off following four successive quarterly declines, and
machinery exports flattened after they had fallen in both the first and
second quarters.

IV -9
Most of the third quarter advance in U.S. imports represented
imports of nonfuel products -- particularly cars and foods -- which rose
by 10.5 per cent in volume following five successive quarterly declines.
The relatively strong pace of auto sales in this country stimulated
imports of cars from both Canada and overseas suppliers. The increase in
food imports was largely related to stepped-up arrivals of coffee as
importers sought to build up inventories in anticipation of reduced
supplies from frost-damaged Brazilian fields. Imports of industrial
supplies fell again but at a lower rate than in the preceding quarter;
most of the decline was concentrated in steel-mill products and related
materials.
Imports of petroleum and products averaged a seasonally adjusted
daily rate of 6.9 million barrels in the third quarter, up from 5.7 million
in the second quarter. Stockbuilding in anticipation of a continued rise
in U.S. industrial activity probably contributed to the pickup; inventories
at the end of the September remained below levels reached a year ago,
nonetheless. Some of the speed-up in arrivals, especially in September,
occurred as oil companies scheduled a faster turnaround of tankers in
order to move more oil out of producing areas prior to the October 1 price
increase decreed by the OPEC countries.
Securities transactions. -- The net outflow of funds from the
United States through securities transactions amounted to $230 million
in the third quarter, somewhat below the second quarter rate. A notable
development was the $400 million increase in foreign purchases of U.S.

IV -10
corporate stocks. Foreign purchases were especially heavy early in the
quarter but began tapering off in late August and September as market
activity and stock prices declined in the United States. An especially
large increase was recorded in the third quarter for Switzerland, some
of which may have represented purchases in behalf of OPEC buyers. Direct
OPEC purchases of U.S. corporate equities amounted to $300 million, about
the same quarterly rate as in the first half. Indications are that
foreigners stepped-up their stock purchases somewhat in October as the U.S.
stock market moved up.
Although the third quarter total of $1.3 billion in foreign bond
issues showed little change compared with the second quarter, foreign
offerings declined in both August and September as borrowing conditions
deteriorated and some issues were switched to the Euro-bond market and
others postponed. The downward trend was reversed in October as U.S.
interest rates began to decline; in October the value of new issues more
than doubled to $400 million and those scheduled for November and December
approach $1.6 billion. For 1975 as a whole foreign issues are estimated
at over $6-1/2 billion, far above the previous record amount registered
in 1974.

Bank-reported capital. -- In a sharp reversal of the first half
1975 pattern, bank-reported capital transactions shifted from large
net outflows in the first two quarters to an inflow of $3.3 billion in
the third. Underlying this development was the rapid rise in U.S. interest
rates relative to those in most major financial centers; for example,
rates on 60-89 day U.S. CD's averaged 78 basis points higher than in the
second quarter while the Frankfurt interbank loan rate declined by 72
basis points. The impact of changes in interest rate differentials was
evident on both U.S. claims and liabilities. The increase in claims was
only $800 million -- the smallest quarterly growth of bank assets abroad
in two years -- compared with outflows averaging $3.7 billion in the first
two quarters. Following declines in the first and second quarters, bank-
reported liabilities to private foreigners rose by $4.1 billion which
approached the quarterly rate registered in 1974. In October, however,
a renewed outflow was recorded.
Following a small increase in the second quarter, U.S. liabil-
ities to foreign official agencies of the non-OPEC countries fell by an

IV -12
estimated $4.3 billion (not seasonally adjusted) in the third quarter.
The drawing down of these official dollar holdings largely reflected the
foreign exchange support operations by a number of central banks --
particularly those of Japan, Germany, and Italy. Partial data for October
indicate that, as the dollar began to weaken early in the month, central
banks shifted to net dollar purchases in order to limit the appreciation
of their currencies.
Liabilities to the OPEC countries continued to rise in September,
and preliminary data for October show a further increase. In the third
quarter, holdings of such dollar assets of the oil producing countries
increased $1.6 billion compared with only $1.2 billion in the two previous
quarters combined. If direct purchases of U.S. corporate securities are
added to the $1.6 billion and some allowance is made for the indirect
acquisition of stocks through European investment houses, total OPEC
placements of surplus earnings in the United States amounted to over $2
billion in the third quarter.

IV -13
Economic activity in major foreign countries. There seems
to be a consensus among private and official forecasters that the
cyclical decline in economic activity in major foreign industrial
countries has ended -- or will end -- sometime this year, but that the
recovery will be slow and uncertain. Signs of an upturn are already
apparent in Japan and Canada, but evidence of an upturn is more difficult
to find in Europe. Unemployment rates, which have increased sharply in
most countries -- except in Japan and Italy -- are not expected to fall
significantly for some time, because of the slowness of the recovery
and the current underutilization of employed persons. Rates of inflation
have generally diminished this year, but they still remain uncomfortably
high in many countries and the outlook is for continued high inflation
next year, with many countries expected to record price rises of close
to or above double-digit rates.
In Japan, industrial production in September was 8 per cent
above its low in February (rising in six out of the past seven months),
as residential construction and public works have increased in response
to stimulative actions by the Government. Inventories of finished
goods rose in July and August after declining since last December;
inventories of raw materials continued to increase in those two months.
Latest data suggest that foreign demand for Japanese products has also
increased recently, but other components of final demand -- especially
business fixed investment -- have remained weak. In Canada, where the
recession has been milder than in most other industrial countries, real
GNP rose slightly in the second quarter of this year, and the monthly

IV -14
indicator of real domestic product was 1-1/2 per cent higher in August
than at its low in March. Most indicators of activity in the manufacturing
industries in Canada, such as shipments, new orders, and the inventory/
shipments ratio, also showed gradual but steady improvement through
August.
After declines in April-July, German industrial production
(including construction) rose strongly in both August and September,
although the third quarter average remained slightly below the second
quarter, and well below the first. More significantly, new industrial
orders in Germany (in volume terms) rose sharply in September. There
now seems to be a clear uptrend in foreign orders since June; the trend
in domestic orders was distorted by the need to place orders for investment
goods prior to June 30 to qualify for a bonus, but latest figures show
some strength in that series, as well.
In Italy, activity continues to be very weak, and there are
no signs yet of an upturn. Inventories, according to recent surveys,
are still considered by businessmen to be quite high. There is little
hard evidence of recovery in France, either. Household consumption rose
in the third quarter, unsold inventories of new housing are declining,
and consumer confidence is thought to be picking up. But excess capacity,
low profits, and weak cash flow are leading many firms to revise down-
ward their investment plans for 1976.
In the United Kingdom, officials at the Bank of England and
the Treasury have asserted, both publicly and privately, that the
inventory liquidation has been largely completed. Latest available

IV -15
data show that the stock/output ratio in manufacturing was at an historically
high level in the second quarter; this ratio has been high just before
the recovery phases of previous cycles in Britain. The volume of retail
sales increased moderately during May-September, but remains at a low
level. Sterling advances to the private sector -- which had been flat --
showed some increase in October, with much of the lending going to the
manufacturing industries.
Economic activity in the smaller European countries has
recently been more sluggish than in the major countries, in contrast
to 1974 and early 1975 when their performance was stronger. Since
activity in the smaller countries tends to lag behind activity in the
major countries -- because of the importance of exports in the former
group of countries -- this relative sluggishness is expected to continue
next year.
The recovery in OECD countries is generally expected to be
fairly slow. In documentation recently prepared for a series of
international meetings, the Secretariat of the OECD has forecast that
real GNP in the six major foreign industrial countries will be only about
3 per cent higher in 1976 than in 1975 (see Table 1). These forecasts
are presently being revised upward, taking into account the latest
national forecasts, which are more optimistic. GNP in the smaller
OECD countries is forecast to rise by only 1-1/2 per cent. By way of
perspective, GNP in the six major foreign countries grew at an average
annual rate of over 6-1/2 per cent from 1960 to 1973, while in the

smaller OECD countries the long-term average growth rate was 5-1/2 per
cent. Only in Canada (and the United States) is the rate of growth
in 1976 forecast to be close to its long-term average.
The moderate pace of the forecast recovery is attributable to
the absence of any strong sector to sustain the upturn. With the
exception of Canada, the slowing of inventory liquidation -- and
possible rebuilding -- is the primary cause of the forecast upturn, and
the stimulus from this source cannot be expected to continue for long.
Private consumption expenditures, which generally led the downturn, are
expected to strengthen (except in the United Kingdom), but unless
saving rates fall significantly from their present very high levels
(see below), such expenditures will not provide a major source of strength.
The proposed increase in the value-added tax in Germany, scheduled for
the beginning of 1977, might induce a buying spree in the second half
of 1976, but only at the expense of 1977 expenditures. Private fixed
investment has been especially weak, and, given the exceptionally high
margins of excess capacity, is not likely to increase rapidly. Public
expenditure has been the only component of aggregate demand that has
generally continued to increase in 1974-75. But the need to finance
the already huge public sector deficits and the fear of rekindling
inflation are likely to inhibit further increases in government
expenditures. Finally, the coincidence of weak aggregate demand in
all the industrial countries means that no individual country can rely
on external sources of demand to stimulate recovery. Financing
difficulties that are expected to constrain the imports of non-oil-

IV -18
exporting developing countries also will contribute to the slow growth
of world trade.
It should be stressed that current forecasts for real GNP
are clouded by major areas of uncertainty. Principal among these is
the outlook for personal saving behavior. If the rise in saving rates
in most countries in recent years was induced by increasing rates of
inflation, then one would expect some decline in saving rates next year
in response to the slowing of price inflation that has already been
observed. Similarly, if saving rates rose in an attempt to restore
previous levels of real wealth that had been eroded by higher prices
for goods and services and lower prices for financial assets, then the
decline in interest rates this year, together with any increase in the
stock of net liquid assets that may already have taken place, would
also suggest a decline in saving rates. On the other hand, expectations
of continued high or even rising levels of unemployment provide a
precautionary motive to maintain high saving rates.
On balance, the OECD forecasts presented in Table 1 -- which
assume, inter alia, that saving rates will remain essentially unchanged
in most countries -- seem to be more pessimistic than most other private
and official forecasts. Official national forecasts in the European
countries, in particular, show rates of growth in 1976 considerably
higher than those in Table 1; in addition to showing a general upward
bias that they have exhibited in the past, these forecasts are based
on assumptions of relatively strong growth of world trade and a decline

IV -19
in personal saving rates. FRB staff forecasts are in fairly broad
agreement with the Secretariat's, although they show a somewhat higher
growth rate for the United Kingdom.
All of these forecasts, however, imply that a considerable
degree of underutilization of resources will persist for some time.
Table 2 (below) represents an attempt to suggest the magnitude of the
gap between actual GNP and potential GNP that is forecast for the second
half of 1976. In this table the OECD Secretariat's forecasts of growth
through the end of next year have been converted into an index based
on the second half of 1973 -- a period of generally high employment.
The resulting index for 1976H2 is then compared with two crude measures
of potential GNP in that period. The first measure, labeled "potential,"
assumes simply that GNP could have increased from 1973H2 to 1976H2 at
the same rate it increased on average in 1960-73 (see the first column
of Table 1). The second measure, labeled "adjusted potential," assumes
that historic growth rates are no longer feasible and that feasible
growth rates are 1 percentage point below long-term growth rates for
all countries except Japan, where the feasible growth rate is 4 percentage
points below the long-term average. The lowering of feasible growth
rates for 1974-1976 reflects the loss of income and the costs of
adjustment associated with a sharply different set of relative prices
(i.e., higher oil prices); it also allows for the possibility that the
low levels of unemployment in 1973H2 were not sustainable, i.e. that
economies were above their long-run non-inflationary growth paths.

The results of this exercise, even allowing for its crudeness,
suggest that a very large gap between actual and potential GNP -- of
over 10 per cent -- will remain at the end of next year. Although the
gaps shown in Table 2 have been calculated on the basis of OECD forecasts
for growth in 1976, which are on the lower end of the range of current
forecasts, similar calculations based on the very optimistic forecasts
of the national authorities would tell substantially the same story.

APPENDIX A
Bank Credit Revision
The commercial bank credit figures used in this month's
analysis of financial developments reflect revisions based on the
June 30, 1975, Call Report. This Appendix explains the effects of
the revisions on our previous estimates.
According to the June Call Report data, growth in commercial
bank credit was somewhat larger over the first half of 1975 than the
partially estimated data had indicated. The annual rate of growth in
total loans and investments was 5.1 per cent over the January-June 1975
period compared with an estimated 3.4 per cent as shown in Table 1, and
was revised upward in both the first and second quarters. The new higher
total credit level over the first half reflects larger than estimated
holdings of total loans and "other" (than U.S. Treasury) securities off-
set in part by lower than estimated levels of U.S. Treasury securities,
as shown in Table II.
There were two sources of error involved in the original
monthly estimates of "commercial bank credit:
1) Nonmember bank figures for both loans and "other"
securities were initially estimated too low. These
estimates were derived by applying nonmember/country
member bank ratios of these items to loan and invest-
ment levels from the December 1974 Call to total loans
and investments reported monthly by country member
banks. The June 1975 Call ratios were higher than those
for December reflecting more rapid growth in these
credit items at nonmember banks than at country member
banks. Actually, loans declined at country banks while
increasing slightly at nonmember banks. In the case
of U.S. Treasury securities, however, the June ratio
was lower than the December ratio indicating somewhat
less rapid growth at the nonmember banks relative to
the country banks. The resulting revision of nonmember
estimates added $3.9 billion to loans, and $1.2 billion
to "other securities" and subtracted $0.7 billion from
U.S. Treasury securities as of June 30, 1975. These
revisions in nonmember bank shares of loans and invest-
ments in June were allocated to earlier months back to
January 1975 and carried forward in monthly estimates
subsequent to June 1975.

Division of Research and Statistics.

2) "Window-dressing" estimates were too low. An estimate
of the difference in levels between the last-Wednesdays
of June and December and the Call dates (termed "window-
dressing") must be made and incorporated in the series
except for the rare instances when the last-Wednesday
dates coincide with the Call dates. Between Wednesday,
June 25, and the June 30, 1975 Call date, the actual
amount of "window-dressing" was $1.5 billion higher
than estimated for loans, $0.3 billion for "other"
securities, and $0.1 billion for U.S. Treasury securities,
Therefore, the ratio errors in the basic series noted
above in (1) stemming from changes in the ratios of non-
member to country member bank assets were augmented by
these amounts. However, the "window-dressing" errors
affect only the monthly changes involving June, i.e.,
the larger increases or smaller declines in June were
followed by correspondingly smaller increases or larger
declines in July.
There are two other sources of error that may be involved in
original monthly estimates but neither contributed directly to changes
in the June 1975 levels. From time to time, estimating errors in
levels of domestic interbank loans have been large and have added
considerably to total errors but these loans were estimated only
nominally too high in June 1975 and did not constitute a significant
source of error in the series. Interbank loans, estimated initially
for nonmember banks on the basis of the December 1974 nonmember/country
member bank ratio, were subtracted from total loans to derive "loans
adjusted", the concept used in the Board's seasonally adjusted series.
Also there may be errors in the original reported member bank
data which are incorporated into the credit series. And since nonmember
estimates are based on country member bank reports, the nonmember bank
levels would correspondingly be in error. However, the volume of error
in such reporting cannot be determined for June 1975; it can only be
determined when the last-Wednesday of June or December happens to be
a Call date. Data for past available dates have indicated that report-
ing errors do occur and in some cases, have been fairly substantial.
Among the major loan categories, business loans were $1.1
billion higher on the June Call than had been estimated while real
estate loans were $0.4 billion lower. Consumer loans, which are a part
of consumer credit reports, were not affected by the benchmark revision.
However, it should be noted that there are no all member bank reports

-A3 -
for classes of loans, these figures are available from large commercial
weekly reporting banks only. Estimates for other commercial banks are
made largely on the basis of the movement of total loans at the smaller
banks, the trend of business and other loans as indicated by the most
recent Call Report, and patterns for previous years established in the
monthly benchmarking of the series. Over the first half of 1975, busi-
ness loans declined at an annual rate of 6.6 per cent compared with an
estimated 7.7 per cent while real estate loans increased at an annual
rate of 2.2 per cent compared with an estimated 2.6 per cent.
Levels of loans to nonbank financial institutions and to brokers
and dealers in securities (not shown on the tables) were the same on the
June Call as had been estimated. Ordinarily these loans change little
between Calls at nonweekly reporting banks where the volumes outstanding
are very small compared with those at weekly reporting banks. However,
incorrect estimates for "window-dressing" at the large banks have produced
substantial errors for some past dates. Agricultural loans, which are
concentrated at the smaller banks, were also the same on the Call as
had been estimated. On balance, $4.6 billion of the $5.4 billion esti-
mating error in total loans was in the residual "all other loans."
In the July-September period, the new higher ratios established
from the June Call Report were used to derive revised estimates for non-
member banks, and the estimated level of the commercial bank credit
series was raised accordingly. Over the third quarter of 1975, total
loans and investments were estimated to have increased at an annual rate
of 3.6 per cent compared with 4.8 per cent indicated earlier. 1/ Growth
in all major credit categories was slightly smaller on the revised basis
than on the original basis except for business loans which showed no
change compared with a small decline shown previously. All data subse-
quent to June 1975 are subject to further revision when the December
1975 Call Report becomes available.
1/ Growth rates were lower in the third quarter even though the
estimated levels for July, August, and September were raised
because the upward revision for June was greater than in subse-
quent months due to the one-month effect of window-dressing
errors.

APPENDIX B
THE FULL EMPLOYMENT BUDGET: ALL ADJUSTMENT IN PROCEDURE*
For some time, the staff has recognized the need to modify
its calculation of the full-employment budget in order to make our
estimates of this measure more representative of recent economic
experiences. The issues which demanded attention most urgently were
(a) the degree of responsiveness of personal tax rates to rising
levels of nominal income (calculated at full-employment), and (b) the
appropriate adjustment to unemployment benefits for the impact of
high levels of unemployment. The revisions adopted by the staff are
generally consistent with those adopted by other government agencies
which produce estimates of the full-employment budget.
Previously, the tax rates used by the staff in calculating
personal taxes at full-employment had implied that, due to the pro-
gressive structure of personal tax rates, a 1 per cent rise in full-
employment income would be accompanied by roughly a 1.25 per cent
increase in personal taxes. However, recent economic studies have
indicated that the sensitivity of personal taxes to rising incomes is
actually greater, especially during periods of high rates of inflation.
Accordingly, the staff is now assuming a faster groth in effective
personal tax rates which results in an annual increase of l.4 per cent
in personal taxes for each 1 per cent rise in fall-employment income
during the forecast period.
On the expenditure side, the calculation of the full-employ-
ment budget required an adjustment to take account of the fact that
the observed level of unemployment benefits would be much lower if the
economy were operating at full capacity. In the past, full-employment
outlays were derived by reducing actual outlays by $1.4 billion for
each percentage point the unemployment rate exceeded [4] per cent.
However, a study by the staff of the Council of Economic Advisors
indicates that, while this dollar adjustment was approximately
correct for 1974, it should be increased to $1.8 billion in 1975 and
$2.3 billion in 1976. These larger adjustments reflect (a) increases
in average weekly benefits and the number of eligible persons, and
(b) extensions in the number of weeks an individual is eligible for
benefits.

Division of Research and Statistics.

B -2
The following table shows the full-employment budget estimated
both with and without the staff's revisions. It should be noted that
our new approach is more consistent with that of the Council of
Economic Advisors and the Joint Economic Committee, but that the
estimates may still differ due to different assumptions regarding the
path of expenditures and the projected rate of inflation. Using 1967
GNP as a base, our estimates as well as those provided by other
analysts assume a constant 4 per cent growth rate for the potential path
of real GNP which presumably would yield an unemployment rate of around
4 per cent over the long run. 1/ If one were to assume that a higher
unemployment rate of 5 or 5-1/2 per cent represented a non-inflationary
state of full-employment, the level of capacity GNP would be lower.
However, the staff has not adopted such an assumption since the growth
rate of capacity GNP would be affected very little, and hence, the
period-to-period changes in the full-employment budget would not differ
by much. Also, the assumption of a higher unemployment rate for full-
employment calculations would make our method inconsistent with that
of other government agencies.

1/ The 4 per cent growth in potential GNP reflects an assumed 1.8 per
cent growth in the labor force, a .3 per cent decrease in annual
hours worked, and a 2.5 per cent rise in output per man-hour when
the economy is operating at its potential.
