Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic expansion continued at a slow pace in July,
suggesting a note of caution in the appraisal of third quarter
prospects. Retail sales declined following the June rebound, and
there was little change in industrial production. There was a
solid gain in total employment following two months of virtual
stability, but the labor force also rose strongly and the unemploy-
ment rate increased three-tenths to the January 1976 level. On the
favorable side, prospects for business capital spending are showing
continued--if belated--signs of improvement, and underlying price
and labor cost pressures appear to have remained essentially unchanged.
Despite a pick-up in June, consumer markets do not yet
appear to have regained the momentum that existed earlier in this
recovery. Total sales in July are estimated to have declined about
1.2 per cent from June. Within durables, sales of the automotive
group declined sharply and furniture and appliance sales were
unchanged. Among nondurables, substantial declines were recorded
in sales of general merchandise and food. Excluding autos and non-
consumer items, sales were off 0.7 per cent for the month. After
rising vigorously early in the year, with autos a major source of
strength, retail sales have been nearly flat since March.
Sales of new domestic type autos were at an 8.7 million
unit annual rate in July, off somewhat from June. Stocks of the now
popular large and intermediate cars remain low and trade reports

indicate that sales of these models would have been higher in July
had the supply situation been better. Foreign car sales held at
about the June level.
The latest Conference Board consumer survey, conducted in
late May and early June, showed some improvement in confidence and
buying plans. But the results of this bi-monthly survey, which have
been moving quite closely with retail sales, do not show the optimism
reflected earlier in the year.
Thus far, the recovery in consumption has kept pace with
gains in disposable personal income; by 1976-II both series in real
terms stood over 7 per cent above trough levels registered five
quarters earlier. Despite the recent pause in consumption and a
concomitant slowing of production, total income gains have been
holding up fairly well. However, in June personal income grew only
slightly as wage and salary disbursements fell for the first time in
16 months--reflecting the lack of employment growth and the drop in
the average workweek in June. Employment and wage data for July
indicate a probable rebound in wage and salary disbursements and
transfer payments will rise steeply reflecting the 6.4 per cent cost
of living increase in social security payments.
Following small changes in May and June, nonfarm payroll
employment (adjusted for strike activity) rose by 280,000 in July--
about as large as the peak rates of expansion from late 1975 through
April 1976. The July gains occurred mainly outside of manufacturing--
with State and local government, trade, services, and finance showing
the largest increases. Excluding the effects of strike activity,

nondurable manufacturing recovered almost all of the 25,000 jobs lost
in May and June. The rubber strike continues, with 60,000 workers
still off their jobs. Employment was off slightly in durable manufacturing.
Although total employment increased by just over 400,000 in
July, the unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage point to 7.8 per
cent, as the civilian labor force grew substantially--by almost
700,000. While joblessness worsened most among adult women, unemploy-
ment of prime-age males (aged 25-54) also rose significantly. The
seasonally adjusted level of initial claims for unemployment insurance
benefits was stable at 400,000 weekly in July--a level somewhat above
the first quarter average.
Industrial production is estimated from tentative data to
have risen slightly in July, and for the past two months the index has
risen on average only about a quarter of a percentage point. This is
the weakest two month period for total output since the trough in
March 1975. Continuing the trend evident throughout the second
quarter, production of nondurable consumer goods showed little change
in July, as the adjustment to high inventory stocks and weak sales
continued. Gains in production of durable consumer goods are estimated
to have weakened--as auto assemblies declined in July, reflecting model
changeovers and producers' efforts to restore balance to dealers'
stocks. With momentum contining in capital goods orders, there was
some further growth in output of business equipment, but at a slower
rate than in recent months.
Materials output apparently rose modestly in July and capacity
utilization in this sector remained at about 81 per cent. The utili-
zation rate for durable materials is still considerably below the 86
per cent operating rate in the nondurable materials sector.

In large part, the recent lull in industrial expansion
appears to have been intended to prevent excessive inventory accumulation.
Nevertheless, the book value of manufacturers' inventories rose at a
$20.9 billion annual rate in June, nearly twice as fast as the May
rate of increase and the largest change in manufacturing book value
since December 1974. June stocks rose more at all stages of production
that they did in the prior month and the gain of work-in-process and
finished goods stocks was larger than at any time since early 1975.
The inventory/shipments ratio for total manufacturing rose for the
first time since last fall; for durables, the ratio held constant,
while in nondurables it rose for the second successive month. Even so,
these book value ratios in current dollars still remain low by historical
standards. The book value of wholesale trade inventories rose at a
$7.4 billion annual rate in June, slower than the May increase of
$11.7 billion.
Private housing starts have continued to edge upward as
the June advance just about matched the 5 per cent May increase.
ultifamily starts backed down a bit in June and the level remains
historically quite low, but for the second quarter as a whole they
were up more than 20 per cent to their highest rate since 1974-III.
Single-family starts rose again in June but in the second quarter
were a bit below the first quarter rate. Moderate near-term gains
appear likely to continue in housing activity, as sales of new and
existing homes are rising again, and mortgage credit is readily

available. Saving deposits at thrift institutions resumed their high
rates of growth in July. The overall strength in deposit flows has
kept mortgage interest rates from rising significantly despite increased
mortgage credit demand.
Commitments data for business fixed investment improved
in June. New orders for nondefense capital goods rose 1.5 per cent
in June--adding a sixth month to the unprecedented string of consecutive
gains in this series. Since December the total gain has been 16.5
per cent in nominal terms and 13.4 per cent in constant dollars,
however, these orders in real terms still remain nearly 1/4 below
the peak ordering rate of July 1974.
Unlike recent months, nonresidential construction contracts,
which are quite volatile, advanced along with equipment orders in June.
Contracts (measured in floor space) for commercial and industrial
buildings--where activity has been severely depressed--also rose in
June, and in the second quarter were 24 per cent above the first
quarter level. Most of this strength came in the industrial sector.
Activity in the nonbuilding area also continued strong in June.
Expenditures for producers' durable equipment, in real
terms, have only recently regained the level recorded in 1975-I--the
trough in aggregate activity. Orders also were late picking up in
this recovery and, given an average nine month delivery lag, their
recent strength suggests an optimistic outlook for machinery expendi-
tures later this year and in early 1977.

Wage and price increases continued in June at rates quite close
to those observed earlier in the year. The private nonfarm hourly
earnings index increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.3
per cent in July--above the gain in June but below the 8.2 per cent
rise for all of 1975. So far this year, the earnings index has
increased at just under a 7 per cent annual rate. Over the first half
of 1976, wage rate adjustments for the 1.7 million workers covered
by new major collective bargaining settlements averaged about 8.4
per cent for the first year of their contracts, down from last year's
10.2 per cent.
Productivity in the private business economy increased at a
3.6 per cent annual rate, according to preliminary second quarter data.
(This is a BLS new series reflecting changes in coverage). Productivity
has risen 8 per cent from its trough level, but remains well below
the postwar trend rate of growth. Because of the cyclical recovery
in productivity and some moderation of wage increases, gains in unit
labor costs have decelerated to a 3.3 per cent annual rate over the
past year.
Consumer prices rose by 0.5 per cent (seasonally adjusted) in
June--equal to the average gain of the prior two months and considerably
above the first quarter pace which was dampened by exceptional declines
for food and gasoline. After removing food and energy items from the
CPI, the second quarter advance was 5.5 per cent (annual rate), well
below the 7-1/2 per cent rate recorded over the prior two quarters
but back at about the average inflation rate of the middle quarters
of 1975.

The June rise in retail prices was characterized by the sharp-
est increase in energy prices since July 1975, and a smaller increase in
food prices than occurred in May. Price advances for nonfood commodities
edged off despite a rise in gasoline (over 2 per cent not at an annual
rate) and fuel oil prices. Gasoline prices evidently rose again in
July and appear to be close to last summer's peak. The smaller June
rise in food prices reflected slight declines for beef and pork which
had risen sharply in May. Livestock prices have continued to decline
since the survey date and meat prices can be expected to provide a
source of moderation. Coffee prices rose further in June; there were
also increases in prices of dairy, cereal and bakery products, and
food away from home. The rate of rise in service costs accelerated as
gas and electricity costs were up sharply.
The wholesale price index for July will be released on August
12 and will be reported in the supplement.
Summary data released by the Treasury Department indicate
that the Federal deficit for FY 1976 amounted to $65.6 billion, the
result of receipts and outlays totaling $300 billion, and $365.6 billion,
respectively. While the revenue total generally conformed to earlier
projections, the final outlay figure was about $2 billion less than the
level projected by the staff in July.
This most recent shortfall of actual outlays is attributable for
the most part to expenditures which are largely outside the control of
disbursing agencies--such as income transfers and interest on the public

II -18
debt. Thus, since this does not reflect decisions to shift outlays
intentionally to the third quarter, the staff has not changed its pro-
jection for Federal spending in the transition quarter from the $100.5
billion level. Incoming data for July are generally consistent with
this spending rate.
For FY 1977, the staff is forecasting unified budget outlays
of $410 billion. This reflects Congressional enactment over the Presi-
dent's veto of the Public Works Employment Act which is expected to
add approximately $2 billion to FY 1977 spending. This should be
reflected in State and local purchases later this year. Offsetting
this aid package is a downward revision in outlay projections for
interest payments and unemployment compensation. Consequently, the
staff estimate of aggregate Federal spending for FY 1977 is unchanged
from last month's forecast. The tax legislation recently passed by the
Senate extends last year's tax cuts through 1977 and calls for numerous
tax reform provisions. The extension of tax cuts continues to be con-
sistent with previous staff assumptions, but the tax reform measures
have not been incorporated in the current forecasts due to uncertainties
surrounding its Conference outcome. Thus, receipts are currently
estimated at $353 billion, and the deficit is expected to total $57
billion in the fiscal year beginning in September.
On a full employment budget basis, the staff projection
indicates a quite modest shift toward restraint, with the deficit
being reduced by approximately [$8 billion] in calendar year 1977 from
1976.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The public and private sectors have continued to raise sub-
stantial amounts of funds in financial markets, despite some moderation
in the pace of the economic expansion. While issuance of long-term
bonds and equities by domestic corporations declined somewhat more
than seasonally in July, total short-term business credit expanded
for the third consecutive month. Also, household demands for home
mortgages and consumer credit probably were quite strong in July, as
in June, while bond financing by State and local governments moderated
about seasonally. As has generally been the case throughout the
current recovery, the Treasury placed the largest demands on the
financial markets, meeting most of its July and August cash needs
through sales of coupon securities.
The cost of long-term funds has changed little on balance
since the last FOMC meeting. Short-term borrowing costs, on the other
hand, have declined moderately for the second consecutive month. Most
short-term interest rates currently are about 40 to 60 basis points
above the lowest levels reached during the recession and recovery
period, while most long-term rates are no more than 15 to 20 basis
points above their respective lows.
Growth in the monetary aggregates rebounded in July following
a slowdown in June. M1 increased at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent, after
contracting slightly the previous month. The rate of expansion of
consumer-type time and savings accounts at banks and thrift institutions

III -2
also increased. The acceleration in growth of these deposits--particularly
savings deposits--apparently was associated in part with the recently
reduced level of interest rates on short-term market instruments.
The ability of the financial markets to meet credit demands
at virtually unchanged or declining yield levels has been enhanced by
a widespread opinion among market participants that monetary policy will
not tighten appreciably, and that aggregate credit demands will remain
moderate. Fears that the sharp pickup in the growth of the monetary
aggregates in early July might presage an increase in rates--as occurred
in late April and May--have been allayed by the relative stability of the
Federal funds rate around 5-1/4 per cent and by Chairman Burns' recent
testimony indicating that the FOMC had not changed the M1 growth rate
range for the next year.
Money markets. Since the July FOMC meeting, yields on Trea-
sury bills and private short-term credit instruments have dropped by
10 to 20 basis points, bringing the cumulative declines since early June
to more than 40 basis points on most securities. Three-month Treasury
bills most recently were bid around 5.18 per cent, about equal to
rates prevailing in early May.
The spread between commercial paper rates and the bank prime
rate widened further in July, and total commercial paper outstanding
rose by $900 million on a seasonally adjusted basis--the largest increase
since April 1975. Nonfinancial corporations and finance subsidiaries
of the auto companies accounted for most of the rise.

Bond and equity markets. Since the July FOMC meeting, yields
on short- and intermediate-term Treasury coupon securities have declined
10 to 20 basis points, while yields on long-term issues have shown
little change. Although the terms for the August refunding announced
by the Treasury on July 28 were set aggressively with respect to size
and maturity, the package was in line with market expectations and was
favorably received. The Treasury announced that it would sell at least
$7 billion of new securities in order to redeem $4.5 billion of debt
maturing on August 16 and to raise new cash. Three issues were in-
cluded in the operation: $2 billion of 3-year notes auctioned on
August 3, $4 billion of 8 per cent 10-year notes sold at par through
subscriptions which were taken through August 4, and $1 billion of
25-year bonds auctioned on August 7. The Treasury also indicated that
it would increase the volume of 10-year notes if demand was large.
The 3-year note was sold at an average auction yield of
6.91 per cent, in line with yields on similar outstanding issues.
The 25-year bond also was well received with an average yield of 8.01
per cent. The Treasury attracted more than $24 billion of subscriptions
for the 10-year note, and made allotments of $7.6 billion.
The Treasury has raised a total of $11.5 billion of new cash
in the market since the beginning of July. During the remainder of
the third quarter, Treasury borrowing in the market is expected to amount
to only about $2 billion. In view of the projected budget deficit, the
Treasury thus will need to run down its cash balance by about $5 billion
over the quarter--from the very high $14.8 billion level on June 30.

III -5
Gross issues of publicly offered corporate bonds were $1.3
billion in July, down somewhat more than seasonally from the $2.5 billion
monthly average in the first half of the year. The decline was due
principally to a dearth of prime-rated issues; the larger, higher-
rated corporations apparently had accelerated their bond financing
earlier in 1976 in the expectation that bond rates would move upward as
the year progressed. Privately placed issues, which are sold mainly by
lower-rated firms, are estimated to have remained quite sizable in July.
Access to the public bond market by such issuers had been constrained to
some degree earlier in the year when investors were more quality conscious.
Although corporate bond yields have risen slightly on
balance since the last FOMC meeting, the increases occurred soon after
the FOMC meeting. Yields have moved downward more recently, reflect-
ing the relatively light forward supply of new issues and the edging
lower of short-term rates.
New issues of common and preferred stock by domestic cor-
porations totaled $800 million during July, down about seasonally from
the $1.1 billion pace in the first half of the year. Stock offer-
ings of utilities remained close to the second quarter average, while
those of manufacturers fell off considerably. The major stock
price indexes have fluctuated within a narrow range over the past
several months.

Gross issues of long-term tax-exempt securities amounted to
about $2.6 billion in July, down about seasonally from the second quarter
average. Average yields on municipal securities have edged down a bit
since the last FOMC meeting.
Monetary aggregates. M1 expanded at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 7.5 per cent in July, rebounding from the 0.8 per cent
rate of decline in June, which was associated with a temporary tax-
payment related reduction in private demand balances and a large
build-up of Treasury cash balances. The average growth rate for June
and July was 3.3 per cent, well below the average for the first half
of the year.
Growth of the more broadly defined money stock measures--
M2 and M3--also picked up in July. While due in part to the rebound
in M1, these advances also reflected substantial increases in savings
and consumer-type time deposits at both banks and thrift institutions.
Savings accounts at commercial banks, which failed to increase in
June after several months of rapid growth, expanded at an 11-1/2 per
cent rate in July. Deposit flows to thrift institutions, which also
had slowed in June, resumed the strong growth that had characterized
the first five months of the year.1/ Most of the deceleration in
deposit flows to savings and loan associations in June was due to a
1/ Deposit growth for S&L's and MSB's combined picked up from 11.8 per
cent to 13.9 per cent, measured on a monthly-average basis. However,
on a month-end basis, the June slowdown and July pickup are much
sharper. On this basis, combined growth went from 10.1 per cent
in June to 17.6 per cent in July.

drop in savings deposit growth. The resumption of savings deposit
growth at banks and thrift institutions in July probably was associated
in part with the reductions in short-term market interest rates since
early June, reversing the outflows that followed the back-up of
short-term rates in late April and May.
After advancing by $2.4 billion in June--the first increase
in six months--negotiable CD's at weekly reporting banks contracted
by $1 billion in July. The June increase in CD's apparently was due
primarily to greater-than-usual window dressing for the mid-year
statement date. In fact, a single bank accounted for more than half
of the June increase in CD's and for about half of the decline in July.
Loan developments. Bank loans increased at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of more than 8 per cent in July, representing
almost all of the 6 per cent rise in total commercial bank credit.
Holdings of Treasury securities, which had been accounting for the
bulk of the growth in bank credit over the past 1-1/2 years, declined
sharply in July while holdings of other securities--particularly tax
warrants--grew sufficiently to offset the decline in holdings of
Treasurys.
Business loans at banks declined less than usual in July
following a smaller than usual rise in June, resulting in a seasonally
adjusted rise in July at an annual rate of 5.5 per cent--the largest
increase of the year. Total short-term business credit--bank loans plus
nonfinancial commercial paper--rose by $1.1 billion in July, the third

consecutive monthly increase. The prime lending rate at major banks
held at 7-1/4 per cent throughout July, but the general decline in
short-term market rates induced most major banks to lower their prime
rates to 7 per cent in early August.
Mortgage market activity, which has remained concentrated
in loans for the purchase or construction of single-family homes,
has continued to increase as the value of new residential construction
put in place has picked up somewhat further and sales of existing
homes have reached record levels. Although commercial banks have
been adding to their mortgage holdings at a moderate rate, S&L's
have continued to dominate the conventional home mortgage market to
an unusual degree in this recovery. Moreover, most newly originated
Government-underwritten home loans have been flowing into pools
backing issues of GNMA-guaranteed securities, and S&L's have been
acquiring about 20 per cent of these issues. Issues of GNMA securities
were a record $1.3 billion in July.
In June (latest data available), total mortgage debt
formation at S&L's reached an all-time high of $4.0 billion, and at
the end of the month mortgage commitments outstanding (including
loans in process) were a near-record $20.5 billion. Although S&L's drew
down liquid assets by $1.7 billion in June as deposit flows slowed
temporarily, these institutions remained in a relatively strong balance
sheet position despite the high level of loan commitments. Average
rates on new commitments for home mortgages at S&L's have risen
slightly since mid-July, while yields in the more sensitive secondary
mortgage market have edged downward.

The expansion in outstanding consumer instalment credit
slowed somewhat in June, but the 9.7 per cent annual rate of increase
was about equal to the average for the first five months of the year.
Credit unions accounted for the largest share of the growth, as the
increase at commercial banks was considerably smaller than in May.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. The dollar was relatively unaffected
by the various cross-currents in the exchange markets over the past four
weeks. A firming of the mark led to the re-emergence of speculation on
a snake realignment, but this was countered
by interest rate increases in the Netherlands and
Belgium.
.The yen was also firmer. On the other hand, the French franc
declined somewhat further
, and the Canadian dollar dropped by 2 per cent
Sterling held fairly
steady .The
net effect of all of this was to leave the dollar's weighted average exchange
value essentially unchanged,
The troubles in the snake arose around month-end when the mark
suddenly advanced against all currencies. This led to
a rekindling of speculation that
Germany, with an inflation rate continuing to hold at half that of its
snake partners, would soon have to revalue the mark with respect to other
snake currencies.

.The National
Bank of Belgium raised its discount rate by 1 per cent to 8 per cent on
July 23 and subsequently raised various other official interest rates.
The Netherlands Bank raised its discount rate by 1/2 per cent to 5-1/2
per cent on July 30.
Italian officials announced publicly that they
had repaid all drawings on the System. On July 21, the Bank of Italy
announced a three-month extension of its import deposit scheme which had
been scheduled to expire on August 3.
The French franc was under downward pressure early in the period
under the impact of the growing concern about the effects of the drought
and upward revisions of inflation forecasts. Toward month-end the franc
was bouyed by news of the much better-than-expected consumer price index
for June, but later on the franc came off again, reaching new lows.
Bank of France
raised domestic interest by other means to offer some support
to the franc. On July 22 the Bank of France raised its discount rate by
1-1/2 per cent to 9-1/2 per cent.

The Canadian dollar dropped sharply from just under $1.03 on the
date of the last Green Book to below $1.01 on August 6, before recovering
slightly. Volume in the Canadian dollar market was at record levels
.A hiatus in Canadian bond issues abroad, increased
concern that Montreal and Quebec had lost a lot of money on the Olympics,
and the publication of a pessimistic OECD report on Canada's inflation
prospects contributed in varying degrees to the pressure on the Canadian
dollar.

quarter of this year, or from the average quarterly rate in 1975. However,
the disposition of the increment to OPEC assets in the second quarter
showed a number of major differences from the first quarter pattern. In-
vestments in both the United States and the Euro-currency market were
substantially larger than in the first quarter, while lending to the IMF
Oil Facility terminated in the second quarter and net liquidation of sterling
assets in the United Kingdom rose sharply from the first-quarter level.
Investment flows into the United States increased to $2.8 billion
in the second quarter from a net amount of $0.8 billion in the first quarter
made up of 1) additions to money market and security holdings of $2.2
billion (revised upward from $1.2 billion reported earlier), and 2) negative
direct investment of $1.4 billion reflecting withdrawal of accumulated
earnings from a U.S. oil company by a Middle East government shareholder
(a transaction not previously reported). With respect to the money and
capital market assets, in the second quarter Middle East oil-exporting
countries reduced their incremental investment here to $2.7 billion from
a first-quarter total of $3.0 billion that included $1.4 billion of ac-
quisitions of short-term assets (of which $1.0 billion not reported earlier)
with funds obtained from the above-mentioned liquidation of direct investment
holdings. However, African oil exporters, Venezuela, and Indonesia each
shifted from net disinvestment in the first quarter, totaling $0.8 billion
for the three, to net investment in the second quarter of $0.1 billion.
The higher net inflow of OPEC funds into U.S. money and capital market
assets took the form of stepped-up purchases of both short-term assets
and Treasury bonds and notes.

IV -6
U.S. Treasury estimates of OPEC net additional investment in
the United States have also been raised substantially for 1974 and 1975 --
to $12.0 billion in 1974 (from the earlier-reported figure of $11.25 billion)
and to $9.5 billion in 1975 (from $6.3 billion previously). The 1974
revision takes account of $0.3 billion of OPEC direct investment in a U.S.
oil company and an estimated $500 million of debt repayments. The higher
level for 1975 now reported reflects Treasury estimates that, in addition
to money market and security investments of $6.3 billion (revised upward
from $5.9 billion), OPEC countries made $1 billion of direct investment
in a U.S. oil company, another $500 million of debt repayment, about $1.5
billion of prepayments of U.S. goods, and $200 million of real estate
and other investments. These estimates -- most of which are subject to
wide margins of error -- are shown in the attached table; except for direct
investment, estimates for the two halves of 1975 separately cannot be made.
OPEC countries added $2.8 billion to their Euro-currency deposits
in London and elsewhere in the second quarter, much more than in the three
preceding quarters and close to the rate of addition to these deposits
in the first half of 1975. The stepped-up accumulation of Euro-currency
deposits reflected the phase-out of the IMF Oil Facility and the rundown
of sterling assets. Lending to the Oil Facility was negligible in the second
quarter as the Facility made its final disbursements. OPEC loans to the
Facility totaled $5.7 billion during the Facility's two-year existence.
Net disinvestment by OPEC countries in sterling assets in the
United Kingdom became much larger in the second quarter; this was the fifth

IV -7
consecutive quarter in which sterling holdings in Britain were either
reduced or not increased. Liquid sterling holdings declined the equivalent
of $1.2 billion in the second quarter, compared with $0.4 billion in the
first, while net acquisitions of other sterling assets (including corporate
securities and real estate) were $0.1 billion in each quarter. For the
five quarters 1975-II through 1976-II, liquid sterling holdings fell $2.7
billion and net acquisitions of other sterling assets came to $0.4 billion,
for a net reduction in total sterling assets in the U.K. of $2.3 billion.
British borrowers obtained $0.6 billion of non-sterling loans
from OPEC lenders in the second quarter, the first such borrowings since
the second quarter of 1975. Direct loans of this type were a substantial
$1.2 billion in 1974, but they amounted to only $0.2 billion in 1975.
The loans this year have not been publicized, but presumably they concern
loans to U.K. public authorities by Gulf state oil producers.
In addition to the current account surplus, another source of
investible funds -- at least temporarily -- for the OPEC countries this
year has been foreign borrowing. According to World Bank data, in the
first half of 1976 OPEC countries arranged $1.7 billion of medium-term
Euro-credits, principally by Iran, Algeria, the UAE and Indonesia. In the
table, the residual entry (line VI) is necessarily on a net basis, and
includes liabilities corresponding to proceeds of foreign loans temporarily
invested pending their expenditure on goods and services. However, because
of data limitations, it is not possible to add drawdowns of foreign loans
to the estimate of the surplus on goods and services and show the dis-
position of the combined amount.

U.S. International Transactions. The U.S. merchandise trade
balance showed a $4.7 billion deficit at a seasonally-adjusted annual
rate during the second quarter, compared with a $6.0 billion deficit
during the first quarter. With the surplus on service account expected
to be slightly larger than in the first quarter, the current account
balance should show a small surplus, after being essentially zero in
the first quarter.

U.S. exports rose to $113.9 billion at a seasonally-adjusted
annual rate during the second quarter, up $6.1 billion from the first
quarter. About two-thirds of this increase represented an increase
in non-agricultural exports.
The increase in non-agricultural exports from $86.4 billion
during the first quarter to $90.6 billion during the second quarter
compaised about a 3-1/2 per cent increase in volume and a 1 per cent

increase in prices. This increase was largely attributable to increases
in world demand, which has been rising at a rate somewhat above trend
as recovery from the recent recession continues. The weighted-average
value of the dollar has appreciated about 7 per cent since January, but
the effect of this on the foreign currency prices of U.S. goods has been
approximately offset by foreign price increases. About 20 per cent of
the increase in non-agricultural exports was in automotive equipment to
Canada, typically related to Canadian assembly of automobiles for the U.S.
market; another 20 per cent of the increase was in exports of non-
agricultural industrial supplies, typically related to expansion in foreign
economic activity; and about 25 per cent of the increase was in exports
of civilian aircraft and parts, a volatile series. New export orders
for durable goods (excluding motor vehicles and aircraft) rose about 7
per cent to $3.5 billion during the second quarter, while unfilled
orders (excluding motor vehicles and aircraft) fell about 4 per cent
to $7.1 billion.
U.S. agricultural exports increased by $2.0 billion to a
seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $23.3 billion during the second quarter,
with an estimated 10 per cent of the increase in volume and unit values
down slightly. This increase largely reflects the poor European crop
outlook and low stocks of several months past. The European drought has
not yet affected U.S. agricultural export statistics, since volume and unit
value figures reflect sales contracted earlier. During the second
quarter, spot agricultural prices rose sharply and then fell back some-

IV -10
what as improved prospects for crops in the United States and the
Soviet Union enabled the market to absorb the current and anticipated
increased European demand without a substantial price rise. Unit values
will probably rise in the third and fourth quarters, reflecting higher
prices in contracts signed in late June and early July, and should then
recede somewhat.
Over eighty per cent of the increase in U.S. exports went to
other developed countries, whose imports from the United States increased
by about 9 per cent over the preceding quarter, compared with a rise
of only 3 per cent in exports to the developing countries. U.S. exports
to the developing countries have tended to lag behind exports to the
developed countries because many developing countries are taking
measures to hold down imports in the face of large accumulated debt and
weakened international reserve positions. Based on preliminary data,
U.S. exports to non-oil developing countries were flat through the
second quarter and down somewhat from the first quarter, while U.S.
exports to the oil-exporting developing countries rose steadily through
the second quarter, at about the same rate as exports to the developed
countries.
U.S. imports rose to a rate of $118.5 billion during the
second quarter, from $113.8 billion during the first quarter. The bulk
of the increase is attributable to increased imports of fuel.

IV -11
U.S. fuel imports rose from a rate of $31.9 billion in the
first quarter to $36.4 billion during the second quarter, primarily
because of increased domestic demand associated with rising income,
and to a lesser degree because of a continuation of the gradual decline
in domestic U.S. production. While recent House-Senate conference agree-
ment on a bill to permit the price of domestically-produced crude oil to
rise at a rate of 3-10 per cent year indicates the bill's likely passage,
the price provisionsof this bill are unlikely to have much impact on U.S.
oil consumption. The U.S. crude oil price control program does not
affect the price of refined petroleum products, although it does affect
the cost of crude oil to domestic refiners, and hence their costs and
profits. The U.S. price of petroleum products has stayed in line with
the world market prices of these products, which is determined by the
OPEC price of crude and the margins charged by European refiners
(currently low, but rising with increasing world demand). Thus, an
increase of about 25 cents in the price of a barrel of refined petroleum
products in the first half of 1976 occurred at the same time that
Federal regulators rolled back the domestic price of crude oil by about
65 cents per barrel.
U.S. imports of non-fuel products were virtually unchanged at
$82.1 billion during the second quarter. Prices increased by about
2 per cent, while import volume declined after what appeared to be a high
rate of inventory accumulation during the first quarter.

IV -12
Bank-reported claims on foreigners increased by about $4.4
billion during the second quarter. The increase in claims in June
reflects U.S. banks' funding of their branch lending activities. This
would be in line with the relative easing of U.S. interest rates in
June.
Bank liabilities to private foreigners increased by $2.8
billion during the second quarter, compared with an increase of $1.3
billion during the first quarter. Of the second-quarter increase, $900
million represented increaseddemand deposits held by foreign banks with
U.S. banks. The $2.8 billion reduction in liabilities to foreigners
during June was largely attributable to reserve transactions associated
with the last business day of May being on Friday.
Private securities transactions, other than dealings in U.S.
Treasury obligations, accounted for an outflow of $1.2 billion during the
second quarter, somewhat less than the outflow of $1.5 billion during
the first quarter. Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks fell
to about $200 million during the second quarter, down about $800 million
from the first quarter, and reflecting, to some degree, the end of the
earlier sharp run-up in U.S. stocks prices. But the outflow on U.S.
purchases of foreign securities declined as well, largely owing to a
decline in new bond issues to $1.5 billion, affer a first quarter outflow
of $2.8 billion. New issues in July amounted to $1.9 billion, much of
which was accounted for by a $750 million IBRD issue and a $470 million

IV -13
privately-placed Canadian provincial issue not announced earlier. The
August bond-issue calendar indicates little activity, but conditions
remain attractive for Canadian issuers and new issues could quickly
be brought on the market, as happened in July.
Foreign official assets in the United States increased by
$2.5 billion during the second quarter, compared with an increase of $1.9
billion during the first quarter. OPEC member countries increased their
liquid and securities investments in the United States by $2.9 billion,
compared with an increase of $2.2 billion during the first quarter. Most
of this change in asset accumulation went into short-term instruments as
OPEC member countries held purchases of corporate securities at $600
million, about the first quarter rate. Official assets of other countries
held in the United States declined by about $400 million,

IV -14
Recent Trade Developments in Major Foreign Industrial
Countries. The downturn in economic activity during 1974 and early
1975 was accompanied by the first significant decline in the volume of
international trade in the post-war period. For the OECD area as a
whole, import volumes fell by 8 per cent between 1974 and 1975, while
export volumes declined by 5 per cent. The volume of world trade
picked up sharply in the last quarter of 1975, reflecting the recovery
of economic activity in the major industrial countries and the importance
of inventory swings, which, because of the high import content of stocks,
gave an extra boost to trade. So far in 1976, the growth of trade has
continued, but at a somewhat slower pace. (See Table 1).
The role which trade played in the economic downturn and
subsequent recovery varied among the industrial countries. The decline
in the volume of international trade in late 1974 and early 1975 originated
in the fall in import demand in some of the major industrial countries,
particularly the United States, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and
Japan. At the same time, exports of these countries held up quite well.
These countries thus had large swings toward surplus in their trade
accounts during the first half of 1975 (see Table 2), and the external
sector played an important role in moderating the impact of the recession
during the period. In other industrial countries, notably Germany, the
Scandinavian countries, and Canada, export volume turned down sharply
while imports were maintained or increased, and the decrease in foreign
demand had a considerable contractionary impact on economic activity.
These countries experienced declines in their trade surpluses, or increases
in their trade deficits, in value terms.

During the current upswing in economic activity, strong exports
have provided impetus to the recovery in Japan, the United Kingdom and,
to some extent, France. In other countries, notably Canada and Germany,
export volumes remain below 1974 peak levels, and only recently have
exports shown some sign of becoming a major factor in the revival of
economic activity.
During the first half of 1976 the trade surplus of the six
major foreign industrial countries, taken together, increased by about
$9 billion at an annual rate over the last half of 1975. The increase
was attributable mainly to the sizeable increase in the Japanese surplus.
In view of the problems of indebtedness and financing of the developing
countries, it is interesting to note that although the trade surplus of
the major foreign industrial countries with the world as a whole increased
in the first quarter of 1976, their trade surplus with the non-oil-
exporting developing countries declined from the previous quarter by about
$4 billion at an annual rate.
In Japan, foreign trade has played a major role in the
recovery, leading some observers to characterize the current upswing as
"export-led". The increase in the current-account surplus accounted for
about one-third of the increase of almmst 15 per cent at a seasonally

adjusted annual rate in real GNP in the first quarter of 1976. Japanese
exports, in particular to the United States, have been very strong in
large part due to stock replenishment by foreign importers of Japanese
durable consumption goods. Japanese imports, on the other hand, until
very recently remained virtually unchanged, probably because of carryover
of high Japanese inventories of imported goods. This pattern resulted
in large trade surpluses, averaging almost $12 billion at an annual rate,
for the first half of 1976. In June, however, the seasonally adjusted
volume of imports rose sharply, which may signal the beginning of an
acceleration in Japanese imports. The trade balance thus is expected to
decline somewhat during the second half of 1976, both because of the
anticipated increase in imports, and because stock adjustment abroad, which
contributed to the first-half export surge, should be completed.
The volume of French exports held up relatively well in 1975
compared to the world average, while import volume fell sharply, primarily
reflecting stock liquidation. The merchandise account thus shifted from
a deficit of $3-1/2 billion in 1974 to a surplus of $1-1/2 billion in
1975. This movement was reversed in the fourth quarter of 1975, as
imports picked up sharply in pace with the economic upturn, and exports
stagnated, resulting in a shift toward a deficit in the trade balance for
the fourth quarter. The trade deficit has decreased, however, since the
beginning of the year as exports have been growing slightly faster than
imports. This improvement will probably not continue; the European drought

IV -19
is expected to have a substantial negative impact on the French
agricultural trade balance, offsetting any further improvement in the
other trade accounts during 1976.
As in the case of France, Italian exports did relatively well
during the downturn, growing slightly in volume terms despite the weakness
in Italian export markets. At the same time, the severity of the Italian
recession produced a sharp drop in imports. In fact, Italian trade was
near balance in the second quarter of 1975, a sharp turnaround from the
deficit of nearly $10 billion at an annual rate during the third quarter
of 1974. The beginning of the economic upturn and inventory rebuilding
in Italy stimulated imports in the last quarter of 1975, when the
merchandise trade deficit increased to an estimated $16 billion at an
annual rate. So far in 1976, the deficit has continued at about that rate,
but the slowdown in Italian economic activity and the depreciation of the
lira should limit import growth and stimulate exports so that the trade
account is expected to improve in the second half of this year.
Economic recovery in the United Kingdom during late 1975 and
early 1976 was led by strong growth in export volume. Import volume fell
during the same period due to the lagging position of the United Kingdom
in the present cycle. In the second quarter of 1976, however, continued
growth in export volume was overshadowed by a surge in imports, which,
coupled with a deterioration in the U.K.'s terms of trade, doubled the
merchandise trade deficit over the exceptionally low first-quarter figure.
Despite the second-quarter increase, which was attributable in part to

IV -20
stockbuilding, the trade deficit for all of 1976 is expected to be
slightly smaller than in 1975. The present incomes policy and the decline
in sterling are expected to curb demand for imports and keep British
exports competitive.
The drop in Germany's trade surplus was a major factor in the
decline in German GNP last year, as German exports declined sharply
in volume terms in the first quarter of 1975 and remained below the
exceptionally high 1974 levels. Import volumes, which fell by a lesser
amount in late 1974 and early 1975, resumed a slow upward trend in the
second quarter of 1975 and have since continued rising. As a result,
the perennial German trade surplus, seasonally adjusted at annual rates,
declined in dollar terms from the peak of slightly over $24 billion in
the first quarter of 1974 to about $16 billion in the fourth quarter of
1975, despite some improvement in the German terms of trade during the
period. The decline in the surplus was larger in DM terms due to the
appreciation of the DM relative to the dollar during the period. So far
this year, both imports and exports have grown moderately, and the quarterly
trade balance has increased slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis. Most
observers predict that the German trade surplus will be somewhat smaller
this year than the $19 billion recorded in 1975 due to the leading position
of Germany in the cycle.
Weak external demand was the major factor in the slight economic
downturn in Canada, as well. In real terms, Canadian exports fell

IV -21
throughout almost all of 1974 and 1975, while imports, responding to
fairly bouyant domestic demand, remained relatively strong. These
volume changes, combined with a slight deterioration in Canada's terms
of trade during the period, caused the trade surplus to narrow during 1974
and fall into deficit during 1975. In response to the economic expansion
abroad, particularly in the United States, Canadian exports have been
growing moderately since late 1975 in both real and value terms. Canada's
net export position is expected to improve throughout 1976, thereby
strengthening the domestic economy.
The smaller OECD countries, taken as a group, recorded an
unprecedented trade deficit of $22 billion in 1974, which decreased only
marginally in 1975. This exceptionally large deficit persisted mainly
because, while activity in the larger countries fell in late 1974 and
early 1975, the GNP of the smaller countries in general continued to
grow. Considering the lagged timing of their upswing, compared with the
larger countries, a slight decline in the collective deficit of the smaller
OECD countries to $17-1/2 billion in 1976 is expected.

APPENDIX A*
JULY REVISION TO THE NATIONAL INCOME AND RODUCT ACCOUNTS
The overall contour of real economic activity was little
changed by the July revision of the national income and product accounts.1/
The level of nominal gross national product (GNP) was revised upward by
$.2 billion in 1973, $6.3 billion in 1974 and $17.4 billion in 1975.
The GNP price indexes were also revised and now indicate slightly larger
advances in 1974 and 1975. On balance, on a year over year basis, real
GNP is now estimated to have risen a bit more in 1973 and fallen only
slightly less in each of the following two years (see Table I).
Quarterly real GNP growth rates are higher or unchanged in
eight of the thirteen quarters covered by the revision. There was an
especially large upward revision to real growth in 1975-II, a downward
revision in each of the latter two quarters of 1975, and an upward revi-
sion in 1976-1. Prior to the revision real GNP showed a peak to trough
decline of 6.6 per cent and this figure remains unchanged. Similarly,
by 1976-1 real GNP was previously estimated to have risen by 7 2 per
cent from its trough and this figure has now een edged up to 7.3 per
cent.
The most important implications of the revision are the fol-
lowing:
1. Personal consumption expenditures were revised up con-
siderably starting in early 1975; as a result, by 1976-I
the saving rate was reduced by about three quarters of a
percentage point.
1/ This annual revision covers the three year period 1973-I to 1976-I
and incorporates new source data that was not available when the
prior estimates were made; in addition, seasonal factors were also
updated.

2. Nominal purchases of goods and services by State and local
governments were revised up markedly, but the revision
in real purchases was much smaller. Prior to the revision
the growth in nominal purchases slowed somewhat in 1975;
these utlays are now shown to have risen at near peak
rates for the year as a whole.
3. Rates of change in prices, using the GNP fixed-weighted
index, were revised up on average by .4 percentage points
in both 1974 and 1975. The largest upward revisions came
in consumption prices and prices for State and local
government purchases.
4. Revisions in the income accounts now show a weaker cor-
porate profits picture than was indicated earlier, but
this is due mainly to a larger capital consumption adjust-
ment.
Personal Consumption Expenditures
Starting in 1975-I there were increasingly large revisions to
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and by 1976-I current dollar
PCE was revised upward by $14.0 billion; over $10 billion of this revision
was in services, $5½ billion was in durables and the level of non-
durables was revised down over $1 billion. Almost all of the upward
revision in durables was in motor vehicles and parts, whereas for services
it was more widespread. On average, over the five quarter period 1975-I
to 1976-1, about two-thirds of the upward revision in nominal PCE was
offset by upward revisions in prices--especially for services.
On balance, consumption activity is now shown to have recorded
a stronger recovery than indicated by earlier estimates. After peaking
in 1973-III real PCE is now estimated to have dropped 2.9 per cent before
reaching its trough in 1974-IV--a figure unchanged by the revision; however,
from this trough to 1976-I real PCE is now estimated to have risen by 7 per
cent and this is close to a full percentage point higher than the gain
indicated prior to the revision. Not surprisingly, the saving rate was
reduced throughout the recovery period so that by 1976-I the rate is now
estimated to have been 6.9 per cent rather than the 7.6 per cent pre-
viously indicated. In particular, the saving rate now shows a sharper
downward drift beginning in 1975-III. This revision in the saving rate
came despite average upward revisions in disposable personal income of
$6 billion in recent quarters (see below).

A-3
Business Fixed Investment
By the end of the period covered by the revision, current
dollar business fixed investment (BFI) was lowered by $4.7 billion,
but most of this revision came in 1975-IV and 1976-I. Constant dollar
BFI was not revised down proportionally as there were partially off-
setting downward adjustments to prices. The revisions in outlays in
these two quarters are largely based on the results of the Commerce
plant and equipment survey, which were not available when the quarterly
GNP estimates were made. From its peak in 1974-I to the trough in
1975-III the decline in real BFI is now 17.5 per cent and this is
essentially the same as that shown previously. But, because of the
downward revision beginning in 1975-IV, the investment recovery through
1976-I now appears even weaker as real BFI rose by only 2.3 per cent
from its trough level compared to the 4.4 per cent gain shown earlier.
Residential Construction
Housing outlays were revised upward beginning in late 1974
and by the end of the revision period (1976-I) were $2.7 billion higher.
Most of this revision was also carried through to real outlays as
housing prices were very little changed after the revision. The charac-
teristics of the sharp cyclical swing in housing expenditures were
little affected by the revision. From peak levels in 1973-I real hous-
ing outlays dropped 45 per cent to the 1975-I trough--only a bit less
than the previous data indicated. Similarly, for the recovery starting
in 1975-I real housing rose 24.5 per cent by 1976-I, virtually the same
as indicated previously.
Change in Business Inventories
In both current and constant dollars the level of total
business inventory investment by 1976-I was little changed by the July
revision. However, for the nonfarm sector the rate of accumulation
was revised upward for 1974-II and downward for the four quarters that
followed; over the same four quarters there was an upward adjustment to
farm inventory accumulation. Furthermore, the revision now shows a
larger rate of liquidation for nonfarm inventories in 1975-IV.

A -4
Movements in the inventory/sales ratios were changed very
little by the revision. However, there was a definitional change in the
nonfarm ratio and this resulted in a downward level adjustment over the
entire postwar period.2/ The inventory/sales ratio for total business
inventories is now indicated to have fallen a bit further in 1976-II--
continuing the drop from the extremely high peak level of 1974-IV.
Net Exports
Net exports were very little changed by the July revision.
By 1976-I net exports were less than $1 billion lower than indicated
earlier. Beginning in 1975 current dollar imports are now a bit stronger
than they appeared to be previously. In addition over the 1973-74
period there were substantial upward revisions in implicit import
prices. The international sector has been subjected to volatile move-
ments over the past several years and the revisions have done little
to alter the magnitudes of the various swings in the U.S. net export
position.3/
Federal Sector
The pattern of federal government purchases of goods and
services was little changed by the revision. Outlays were revised
upward in all quarters of 1975 and there was a particularly sharp
upward revision in 1975-II; however, in 1976-I outlays are about $2
billion lower and now show a decline of over $1 billion from the prior
quarter. The federal sector deficit (NIA basis) is somewhat smaller
2/Previously, nonfarm sales were used to calculate this ratio, but
because of the unreliability of farm sales data, total business
sales (including final sales by farms) are now being used in the
denominator.
More specifically, after peaking in 1974-I, real net exports
dropped 19 per cent by 1974-III (prior figure was 19.2 per cent)
then rose 63.1 per cent by 1975-II (prior figure was 64.9 per cent)
then dropped 31.7 per cent by 1976-I (prior figure was 30.1 per
cent).

A- 5
in 1975 than our prior data indicated and by 1976-I is almost $5 billion
less than the prior indication. About $4 billion of this reduction comes
from an upward revision to receipts--almost solely in corporate tax ac-
cruals.
State and Local Government Sector
Growth in nominal State and local purchases was revised up sub-
stantially for 1975 from 9.8 per cent to 11.9 per cent--almost as high as
the peak 1974 growth rate. Prices were also revised up, and so the up-
ward revision in real purchases was considerably smaller than for current
dollar purchases. For 1975 as a whole, for example, nominal purchases
were revised up by $6.5 billion but real outlays were raised by only
$1.9 billion. On a quarterly basis, the revision of nominal purchases
of goods and services was as high as $8.7 billion in late 1975 but then
fell back to $7.4 billion in 1976-I. The resulting pattern of spending
now reflects a more distinct slowdown in late 1975 and early 1976--
presumably due to the New York City crisis.
The upward adjustment in expenditures, combined with a smaller
upward revision of receipts, caused the surplus of the State and local
sector to be revised down considerably; the $6.9 billion surplus in
1975 is almost $3 billion below the figure previous data suggested. The
"operating surplus or deficit"--which excludes the social insurance funds--
was also revised downward4/ beginning in the latter half of 1975; however,
the revised data still show an improved fiscal position for the State
and local sector in the first quarter of this year.
Prices
As pointed out above the major comprehensive price indexes
were revised up somewhat beginning in early 1974. The implicit GNP
deflator is now estimated to have risen by 10.0 per cent in 1974 and
9.3 per cent in 1975; the latter inflation rate is about .5 percentage
point higher than the indication before the revision. Only a small part
of this revision can be attributed to the revised mix of GNP as upward
revisions to the GNP fixed-weighted price index were only a bit less
than those for the implicit deflator5/
4/ Furthermore, there was an increasingly large upward revision to
social insurance funds.
It should be pointed out however, that upward revisions to the fixed-
weighted price index for gross domestic business product averaged only
about a quarter of a percentage point over the years 1974-75.

A -6
As to the composition of price revisions for 1974 and 1975,
the largest upward revisions on a fixed-weighted basis were in consump-
tion and State and local government. The change in the PCE price index
was revised up about .3 percentage points in 1974 as well as in 1975;
in both years the largest upward revision was in the services component
although the index for PCE goods prices was revised up as well. In the
government sector the fixed-weighted price index is now estimated to have
risen about one percentage point more for 1975 than indicated previously
and this is solely attributable to upward revisions in the index for
State and local government purchases. Fixed-weighted price changes for
business fixed investment were raised .5 percentage point in 1974 but
lowered by about the same amount in 1975.
As to the quarterly pattern of the revised price picture the
upward revisions in the major indexes were not really significant until
1975-I. Revisions to aggregate price movements were slight through the
remainder of 1975 and for 1976-I the small gain in prices that had been
previously indicated was revised down even further.
Income
Table II highlights the impact of the July revisions to the
income side of the accounts--given the upward revisions in nominal GNP.
Most significantly, by 1976-I the profits share (with IVA and capital
consumption adjustment) was reduced considerably from the prior indica-
tion as was the net business component of personal interest income.
Large offsetting upward adjustments were made to the share of proprie-
tors income--especially nonfarm--and to the share of the capital con-
sumption allowance; the share of wages and salaries is only a bit higher
than shown previously. On a quarterly basis, the level of corporate pro-
fits (with IVA and capital consumption adjustment) was revised down
throughout the period covered by the revision.- By 1975-II the downward
revision totaled $10 billion; thereafter, this revision was a little bit
less. From trough levels in 1975-I the recovery in profits over the
following four quarters was little changed by the revision.
The revisions in disposable personal income ranged from $4½
to $7 billion over the period 1975-II to 1976-I. The revised personal
income data indicate less severe contractions of real personal income
and real wage and salary disbursements during the 1973-75 period than
did the data prior to the revision.
6/ However, by 1976-I a larger capital consumption adjustment accounted
for over three-fourths of this revision. In essence, this adjustment
is used to reconcile depreciation reported in tax returns with that
implied by a more appropriate measure of economic replacement.
