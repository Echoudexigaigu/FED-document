of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Weather-related problems had significant cumulative impacts
on economic activity in January and early February, but current
information suggests both a prompt recovery of activity and somewhat
more underlying strength than had been indicated by earlier information.
Crop damage, of course, has pushed up wholesale and retail food
prices and this should be reflected in forthcoming price data.
The most substantial current evidence of a quick recovery
from weather-related problems is provided by the recent performance
of labor market indicators. Total employment rose by 400,000 between
early January and early February. The civilian labor force also grew
rapidly--by 630,000--more than offsetting January's sharp drop. The
unemployment rate, rose to 7.5 per cent in February from 7.3 per
cent in January. The increase in unemployment appears to have
resulted from energy and weather-related job losses. The number of
workers on layoff for any reason rose 210,000 over the month, and
there was an increase of similar magnitude in energy-related claims
for unemployment insurance. The latter had declined to a level of
less than 10,000 by early March.
The strong gain in employment indicated by the household
survey is supported by estimates from the survey of business
establishments. Nonfarm payroll employment rose 260,000 over the
month. The faster pace of employment growth over the past three
months about matched the rate of recovery during the initial year of
expansion.

II -2
The reacceleration of employment growth was widespread among private
industries and, as the tabulation below shows, included renewed
hiring in manufacturing, where production had been damped between
spring and early winter by excessive inventories as well as by
strikes.

2/ Establishment survey data, adjusted for strikes.
In February, manufacturing employment, which was most
directly affected by gas curtailments, remained at the advanced
early January level. But, the average factory workweek jumped 0.8
hour from the weather-depressed January reading of 39.6 hours. The
lengthened workweek raised total factory manhours sharply in February.
At 40.4 hours in February, average weekly hours were significantly
higher than in December and 1976 as a whole. The indicated strength
may be somewhat overstated, however, since the February survey had
a response rate somewhat below normal, making these data subject to
larger than usual revisions.

Based largely on the establishment survey manhours data,
industrial production is tentatively estimated to have increased
about 1 per cent in February, recovering the entire January decline.
A generally widespread rebound in output is suggested for consumer
goods, business equipment, and most materials. However, weekly
production data for autos and raw steel indicate no increase from
depressed January output levels in these sectors.
Capacity utilization in February also appears to have
returned to about the December level. In manufacturing, the operating
rate probably averaged near 81 per cent, with materials capacity
utilization somewhat lower than the over-all rate. The manufacturing
utilization rate has fluctuated within a narrow band of 79 to 81
per cent since last March as a consequence of nearly equal rates of
growth in both manufacturing capacity and output. Rates of growth
of capacity and output--both at about 2-1/2 per cent over this
recent period--were well below the postwar historical average.
Personal income advanced at only a 3.2 per cent annual
rate in January, following three months of relatively strong growth.

II -5
Curtailments in the workweek were a major reason for the January
slowdown, bringing an estimated weather-related loss of $2.0 billion
(annual rate) in wages and salaries. Manufacturing and construction
payrolls were most severely affected. Other significant factors in
slower income growth in January were a sharp drop in dividends from
an unusually high December level and an increase in employee social
security payments.
Consumers continue to be relatively confident in their
attitudes about their prospective economic situation. The University
of Michigan Survey Research Center index of consumer sentiment,
according to its February survey which is still confidential, had
recovered some of the small decline shown in November. The Conference
Board index of consumer confidence for late January and early
February (slightly earlier than the Michigan survey period) was
little changed from its improved December level. The two surveys,
however, differ somewhat in their assessment of consumers' buying
attitudes for autos: the Michigan survey indicated a substantial
increase in the proportion of respondents considering this a good
time to buy autos, while the Conference Board survey shows a decline
in the proportion of consumers with plans to buy autos. The Michigan
results usually have been better indicators of auto purchases than
the Conference Board survey. The Conference Board also indicated a
decline in the proportion of consumers with plans to buy major
appliances.

Despite adverse weather early in the month auto sales in
February were at a 10.7 million unit annual rate, close to their strike
rebound level of 10.9 in December and 200,000 units above January. Most
of the advance was due to sharply improved sales of imports. At a
1.9 million unit annual rate, foreign cars were selling better than at
any time in the past two years; these sales likely were boosted by dealer
incentive contests and cash rebates.
According to staff estimates based on weekly data for February,
retail sales of goods other than autos and nonconsumer items increased
about 1 per cent from the weather-affected January level. Spending for
furniture and appliances was up 2 per cent, extending the gain in January
and the strong fourth quarter showing. Outlays for food rose more than
1 per cent. Spending for general merchandise, which had been strong
during the second half of 1976, was about unchanged for the month as a
whole after declining sharply in January. Such sales, which are par-
ticularly likely to be postponed due to severe weather, appeared to
improve somewhat during the final weeks of the month.
The book value of manufacturing inventories rose at a $10.2 bil-
lion annual rate in January, following a revised $3.1 billion rate of
decline in December. While stocks at producers of nondurables were
practically unchanged, durable manufacturers' inventories rose at a
$9.9 billion rate in January. A significant factor in the rise in
durable stocks was a sizable turnaround in stocks of

motor vehicle materials and supplies between December (-$8.2 billion)--
when production and shipments were rebounding from the auto strike--and
January (+$4.9 billion). It is possible that some of the January
inventory buildup may have been due to the severe weather, which
hampered shipments. The slow rate of accumulation during the fourth
quarter--$7.6 billion, annual rate--and the relatively low inventory-
sales ratio in January could set the stage for a building of stocks
later this year.
In general, retailers entered 1977 with a lean inventory
position. Although December nondurable retail trade stocks rose
rapidly, offsetting the drop in November, the average fourth quarter
annual rate of rise of nondurable retail stocks was still $1.5 billion
lower than that in the third quarter. Durable stocks other than autos
were run off in December because of strong sales.
Recent data indicate a strengthening pattern of capital
spending. Revisions in contracts and orders data showed that there
was more strength at year-end than was indicated previously, and this
strength continued in January. The December increase in nondefense
capital goods orders was revised up sharply to 11.1 per cent, more
than recovering the November drop; the January increase was 3.1 per
cent. Shipments of nondefense capital goods fell 2.3 per cent in
January probably because of bad weather but unit truck sales and
shipments of farm equipment both advanced.

Although there was some slowing in the growth of fourth
quarter orders, the machinery component did not weaken, suggesting
that the underlying trend in capital goods orders is strong. In
addition, construction indicators appear somewhat firmer than pre-
viously estimated. The fourth quarter change in construction contracts
for commercial and industrial buildings--measured in square feet of
floor space--has been revised from a 2.8 per cent decline to a 4.8
per cent increase, just about offsetting the decrease that occurred
during the third quarter. Nonresidential construction activity appears
to have been considerably hampered by bad weather in January as the
value of construction put in place fell 10 per cent.
Recent capital spending surveys and capital appropriations
data indicate that investment prospects for later in the year have
also improved somewhat. The latest Commerce survey--conducted from
late January to mid-February--showed business planning to increase
plant and equipment outlays by 11.7 per cent in 1977, a slight up-
ward revision from the results reported in the December survey. The
McGraw-Hill survey--taken at about the same time--indicated plans for
a 15 per cent increase--up 2 percentage points from the fall survey.
The two surveys also show significant differences in several industry
categories. Some of the disparity between the overall change indicate
by the two surveys can be attributed to coverage differences between
the two samples and the adjustments for systematic bias employed in

II -13
the Commerce survey.- The Conference Board reported that newly
approved capital appropriations of the 1,000 largest manufacturing
companies rose by 33 per cent in the fourth quarter after falling in
the previous quarter. Some of the fourth quarter jump was due to a
sharp increase by petroleum producers. Excluding this volatile
component, the increase in manufacturing appropriations was still a
considerable 20 per cent--up from a 16 per cent decline in the third
quarter.
Adverse weather also set back residential construction
activity in January. Private housing starts dropped to 1.38 million
units annual rate--more than a fifth below the advanced fourth
quarter average. Declines in January were sharpest in the Northeast
and North Central regions, where the winter had been most severe.
Starts in the West, in contrast, were unchanged from December and 11
per cent above the fourth quarter pace. In addition to delaying
housing starts, the severe weather conditions inhibited construction
progress on units started in earlier months. Altogether, Census
Bureau estimates indicate that residential construction outlays
dropped nearly a tenth in January from the previous month.
1/ The methodologies used by Commerce to adjust responses for
systematic bias are not the same for the annual (December) survey
as for the recent quarterly survey. Thus, a comparison of the
changes between these two surveys may not be entirely meaningful.
On an unadjusted basis the increase shown in the Commerce survey
was revised upwards from 11.7 per cent in December to 14.2 per
cent in February.

Underlying housing and mortgage market conditions suggest
that the harsh weather's impact on residential construction will be
short-lived. Home sales in January--both new and existing units--
edged down only moderately from their record December rate. In addition,
rental markets have continued to tighten in most areas and, with savings
inflows still relatively substantial at thrift institutions, mortgage
loan commitments outstanding at S&L's at the end of Janurry remained close
to the record December volume,
Federal government outlays fell below budgeted amounts in
January and February and growth of State and local government spending
continues to be weak. Value of State and local construction put-in-
place fell sharply again in January, largely, it appears, because
extreme weather depressed building and road work. State and local
employment in February was below the December figure and up only 160,000
from a year earlier--less than half the long term average. In contrast,
State and local revenues have picked up sharply over the past year.
Total receipts increased by nearly 12 per cent over the four quarters
of 1976, led by a sharp increase in income tax payments as well as large
gains in sales and property tax receipts.
The Carter Administration has issued a revised Federal Budget.
Outlays are planned about $6 billion higher in fiscal year 1977 and
$19 billion higher in fiscal 1978. Most of the increase in fiscal 1977
and approximately $8 billion of the fiscal 1978 rise due to

President Carter's previously announced fiscal package. In addition,
for fiscal 1978 the new budget restores about three-quarters of the
spending reductions proposed by President Ford, which had totaled some
$12 billion. The receipts forecasts of $394.4 billion in fiscal 1977
and $401.6 billion in fiscal 1978 assume extension of the 1975 "temporary"
tax reductions and the passage of the Administration's previously
recommended personal and corporate income tax cuts. The Administration
now estimates that the Federal deficit for fiscal years 1977 and 1978
will be $68 billion and $57.7 billion, respectively. These deficits
are each about $10 billion more than was announced by the Ford Ad-
ministration in January. Congress also has revised its budget targets
for fiscal year 1977, The spending target set in the Third Concurrent
Resolution--when made comparable to the C arter budget--is now pro-
jected to be $418.4 billion.

Recent developments on the inflation front continue
mixed. In February, the average hourly earnings index for private
nonfarm workers was only marginally higher following a sharp rise
in January when minimum wage increases became effective. For the
two months combined this index increased at a 5.7 per cent annual
rate, compared to a 6.9 per cent rise during 1976.
The 0.8 per cent jump in the Consumer Price Index in
January was not generally weather-related. Food, which is priced
early in the month, rose 0.9 per cent after little net change over
the three prior months. Much of the increase reflected higher
coffee prices, which are now 70 per cent above a year earlier, and
increases for meats, cereal and bakery products, which had declined
during the fall of 1976. Prices of meats, cereal and bakery
products were still below those of a year earlier.
Among nonfood items, car prices, particularly those for
used cars, continued to accelerate, as did prices for fuel oil.
Prices of natural gas and for medical care services continued rising
at double digit rates. Some of the January advance, however, came
from large, infrequent adjustments for property taxes and water and
sewage rates.
The February CPI--to be reported March 18--is likely to
show more of the effects of the severe weather on food prices. The

weather's effect on agricultural production and food prices can be
only partially assessed as of this date. Indications are that the
U.S. will have adequate citrus supplies in spite of the considerable
freeze damage in Florida. Vegetable production in Florida was
set back by the freeze, but loss estimates have been revised downward
from $150 million to $110 million. Despite some recent rainfall the
outlook for California crops this year continues to be poor. Cut-
backs in water supplies are projected at 25 to 75 per cent in the
Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys where a significant share of the
nation's fruits and vegetables are produced. However, the nation's
current meat supply situation continues to be favorable. Milk,
meat, and poultry production as of early February all were several
per cent higher than a year earlier.
The Wholesale Price Index for February will be released
on March 10 and reported in the Greenbook Supplement.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Securities markets in February were dominated by credit flows
to the government sector. Treasury borrowing was much larger than in
January, and State and local units issued a record amount of long-term
debt for the month. Public offerings of corporate bonds, on the other
hand, were down sharply from the January level, as prime-rated cor-
porations were reluctant to bring issues to market against a background
of higher interest rates. Although the volume of private placements
is estimated to have been large by historical standards, total
capital market issues of corporations in February were about 25 per
cent below the average monthly pace of 1976. With long-term offerings
reduced, businesses relied more on short-term borrowings--both at
banks and in the commercial paper market--extending the broadly based
pickup in such borrowings that began early in the fourth quarter
of 1976.
Short-term interest rates have changed little on balance
since the February FOMC meeting, as Federal funds generally traded
in the 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 per cent range and published data showed only
a moderate expansion in the monetary aggregates. Bond market yields,
however, have risen slightly on balance.
The rise in market interest rates during January and
February and the severe weather have had a depressive effect on
deposit flows to banks and thrift institutions. Inflows of demand
deposits and small denomination time and savings deposits to
commercial banks in January and February were well below their his-

torically high levels in the fourth quarter, and flows to thrift
institutions in this period show a similar--but not as dramatic--
deceleration.
Monetary Aggregates
Reflecting sluggishness in demand deposit growth after
mid-month, M1 expanded at only about a 2 per cent annual rate in
February, down sharply from the 5-1/2 per cent pace in January.
The 3-3/4 per cent average rate of expansion of M1 in January and
February combined was almost 3 percentage points below that of the
fourth quarter. The slower growth of M1 and the diminished net
inflows of savings and small denomination time deposits reduced the
pace of M2 expansion to a 7-1/4 per cent rate in February, also
considerably below the pace of late last year. Similarly, smaller
increases in deposits at thrift institutions last month contributed
to a more moderate 9 per cent rate of expansion of M3.
The slowdown in savings and small time deposit growth at
commercial banks and at thrift institutions has stemmed in part from
the firming in market yields since early in the year. Increases in
market rates have been particularly large for intermediate-term
securities (see chart). As a result, market interest rates have
become more competitive with rates offered on time and savings
deposits, especially since--as reported in earlier Greenbooks--many
depository institutions have cut their offering rates on some deposit
categories. In addition, the unusually severe winter weather has

temporarily reduced wage and salary income for some workers and
increased fuel bills for consumers in the affected areas. It is
likely that these transitory changes in personal income and expendi-
tures have been partially financed by reductions in savings flows
to depository institutions.
With deposit flows reduced and loan demand remaining
comparatively strong, outstanding negotiable certificates of deposit
at large banks expanded in February. The $300 million seasonally
adjusted increase, while modest by historical standards, is only
the fourth monthly increase since January 1976, 1/
Bank Credit and Short-term Business Credit
Both loans and investments increased sharply in February
(last Wednesday of the month series) as bank credit expanded at a
14-3/4 per cent annual rate, faster than in any month since July
1974.2/ Acquisitions of U.S. Government securities were unusually
1/ Recently available data indicate that banks have been obtaining an
increasing volume of long-term nondeposit funds through issues of
subordinated debt. June 1976 call date figures show a $460 million
net increase in subordinated notes and debentures for all insured
commercial banks during the first six months of 1976, the largest
half-year increase since 1972. Gross issues of bank debt continued
strong at about $1 billion in the last half of 1976, and issues
for the first two months of 1977 have outpaced those for the com-
parable period last year. A relatively large volume of this debt
has been placed privately with insurance companies. In addition,
a large money center bank has just announced a public issue of $350
million of 30-year notes to be offered in March.
2/ In February, growth of bank credit and the credit proxy diverged
sharply. Such a divergence is not unusualy for a single month and
generally reflects changes in balance sheet items not included in one
or the other of these measures as well as statistical problems in
comparing averages of daily figures for member banks only for the
proxy with last-Wednesday measures for bank credit at all commercial
banks.

large, with both large and small banks increasing their holdings.
Weekly reporting banks accounted for almost half of the $1.6 billion
unadjusted increase, as their acquisitions in the 1-5 year maturity
range more than offset declines in their holdings of bills and longer-
term issues. Holdings of other securities--mostly tax-exempt issues--
increased for the first time since November, but this rise was well
below the average monthly increase in the last half of 1976.
Total bank loans grew at a 10 per cent annual rate last
month. Real estate and consumer loans have expanded fairly rapidly
in most recent months, reflecting underlying strength in residential
construction and consumer durable sales and a greater willingness by
1/banks to offer these loans at attractive terms.-
Of particular significance is the continued strong expansion
of business loans. Excluding holdings of acceptances, such loans
2/increased in February at an annual rate of 14-1/2 per cent.- Non-
financial commercial paper also increased rapidly, advancing by
$800 million, as industrial companies and communications firms were
active borrowers. In total, short-term business credit excluding
bankers acceptances (memo item c in the table) increased at a 19
per cent annual rate in February.
1/ According to the February Lending Practices Survey, nearly one-
fourth of all respondents reported that they were more willing to
make consumer loans, and none reported that they were less willing.
Twenty per cent of the respondents were more willing to make single
family mortgage loans, up significantly from the November Survey.
A more detailed review of this survey and of an informal staff
survey on loan commitment behavior appears in Appendix A.
2/ Bank holdings of acceptances declined on a seasonally adjusted
basis by about $700 million in February, and now stand $200 million
above the level at the end of September 1976.

III -9
The unusually rapid growth of short-term borrowing by
businesses in February reflects in part a slowing of capital market
financing. In addition, business credit demands may have been tem-
porarily bolstered by production and distribution disruptions induced
by the weather in late January and early February and by some bridge
financing associated with several large advance refundings by tele-
phone companies. As such, the developments in February are the latest
in a series of "special factors" beginning last October--including
inventory fluctuations, changes in holdings of bankers acceptances,
and changing seasonal patterns--that have caused irregular movements
in the growth of business loans.
Over the entire five months October through February, however,
the effects of many of these special influences appear to cancel,
and business loans increased at more than a 9 per cent annual rate
while total short-term business credit rose at an 11-1/2 per cent
annual rate. This suggests the possibility that a fundamental change
may have occurred in short-term business credit markets. Further
support for this view is that business loans appear now to be growing
at both small and large banks.1/ Moreover, borrowing from large
banks, seasonally adjusted, has increased since October for almost
all categories of business borrowers.2/
1/ Business loans at large banks declined about $7 billion, seasonally
adjusted, during the first three quarters of 1976.
2/ Showing particular strength have been primary metals manufacturing,
other fabricated metal products, the residual category of nondurable
manufacturing, mining, wholesale trade, and communications. Only
loans for transportation equipment manufacturing decreased on
balance over this period.

III -10
Still, the factors contributing to any fundamental resurgence
in short-term credit demands since last fall are not readily apparent.
While there has been some slowing in capital market financing over this
period, long-term borrowing--with the exception of February--still has
been quite large by historical standards. Moreover, although there was
some involuntary inventory accumulation early in the fall and perhaps
some effort more recently to replenish stocks drawn down at year end,
inventory accumulation over the period has been quite modest. In addi-
tion, the total financing gap of the corporate sector remains moderate.
Changes in the availability and costs of bank financing may
have been a small contributing factor to the strong expansion in
business borrowing. According to the February Bank Lending Practices
Survey, banks have continued to ease nonprice terms of lending and have
been more aggressive in seeking business loans. Further evidence of an
easing in bank loan terms was found in an informal System survey of banks
which had reported growth in both takedowns and unused commitments in
the monthly Loan Committments Survey. Strong growth in takedowns such
as occurred in late 1976 typically occurs simultaneously with a decline
in unused commitments. However, both takedowns and commitments have
increased at large banks in most recent months. The informal survey
indicates that the growth in outstanding commitments has been due more
to efforts by banks to attract customers than to increasing demands for
commitments by business borrowers. Generally, banks in the survey have
stepped up their marketing efforts and, to a lesser extent, have lowered
fees and eased compensating balance requirements.

III -11
Private Long-Term Securities Markets
Gross issues of publicly offered corporate bonds were $1.25
billion in February, less than half the volume in each of the previous
two months. Some potential issuers, particularly higher-rated
borrowers, apparently were discouraged by the rise in long-term
rates. Offerings of high-rated (Aaa and Aa) firms totaled less than
$500 million during February, compared to more than $2 billion in
January. Offerings by lower-rated corporations declined to $700
million in both January and February after averaging more than $1.3
billion per month in the fourth quarter. Underwriters report that
some of these companies have elected to place their debt issues
privately rather than offer them publicly; life insurance companies
continue to be flush with investable funds, and borrowing costs are
reported to be favorable.
Takedowns of privately placed domestic corporate bonds have
continued at a rapid rate. In 1976 private placements are estimated
at more than $15 billion, almost 50 per cent above the previous record
total in 1975. Life insurance companies--as is usual--have been the
principal purchasers of these bonds. Lower-rated corporations,
particularly manufacturing and other industrial concerns, were the
largest borrowers (see table). Approximately three-fourths of the
1976 commitments by life insurance companies were for third and
fourth quality issues, roughly equivalent to A and Baa-rated
obligations, respectively.

Corporate bond yields have continued to move higher since
the February FOMC meeting. The Board's index of recently offered
Aaa-rated utility bond yields currently stands at 8.25 per cent,
about 10 basis points above its level just prior to the last FOMC
meeting and about 40 basis points above its low in December.
Apparently the rise in bond rates was the result of heightened
concern about the outlook for inflation. Apprehension over future
inflationary pressures appeared to have increased in response to
signs that the economy was rebounding from the weather induced slow-
down of late January and February at a time when passage of the new
Administration's fiscal stimulus package seemed assured. The
release of unfavorable CPI statistics for January reinforced such
worries.
Stock market prices have changed little since the February
FOMC meeting, and daily volume has remained moderate. Although many
corporations recently have reported higher earnings per share for
the final quarter of 1976, investors reportedly remain wary about
the outlook for inflation as well as the impact of the cold weather
on first quarter operating results. During February new stock
offerings continued the moderate pace established in recent months
but are scheduled to increase somewhat during March, in line with
normal seasonal patterns.
Government Securities
During February, the Treasury raised $7.7 billion of new
money in the market through auctions of notes and bonds. Thus far in

III -15
1977, the Treasury has raised $13.6 billion through marketable
borrowing and another $1.5 billion through nonmarketable issues.
February's volume of long-term tax-exempt securities
offerings is estimated at $3.1 billion, a record for the month and
about 15 per cent above the volume sold in February last year.
Advance refunding issues, amounting to $900 million last month,
continue to bolster the credit demands of State and local borrowers.
These funds are required to be reinvested in nonmarketable Treasury
securities.
As in January, February's large volume of tax-exempt
securities was absorbed at relatively stable yields, and the Bond
Buyer index now stands at 5.92 per cent--about the level prevailing
just before the February FOMC meeting. According to dealers,
property-casualty insurance companies continued to be important
institutional purchasers. Risk premiums in this market have narrowed
since the turn of the year, as yields on lower-rated bonds have
changed little while yields on the higher grade bonds have moved
higher. Apparently, institutional interest has shifted to lower-
rated securities in an effort to achieve larger returns on their
portfolios. 1/

still large. At the end of January, outstanding mortgage commitments
remained near their record December level. With deposit inflows at
these associations slowing, net paydowns of Federal Home Loan Bank
advances have been smaller than normal for this time of year.1/
Interest rates on new commitments for conventional home
mortgages at reporting S&Ls have continued to edge down irregularly.
In contrast, yields in secondary mortgage markets have moved upward
since the last FOMC meeting. Since the beginning of 1977, rates on
GNMA-guaranteed pass-through securities, which generally move closely
with bond rates, have advanced about 50 basis points--somewhat more
than the rise in corporate yields. While the increase in yields of
FNMA forward purchase commitments has been more moderate, these
rates also have continued to rise, as mortgage bankers--wary of
possible further reductions in GNMA security prices--have maintained
offerings in comparatively large volume.
Following four quarters of net expansion at about a 10 per
cent annual rate, consumer instalment credit grew in January at
nearly a 13 per cent rate--still below the 15 per cent average for
the comparable phase of earlier recoveries. Expansion of automobile
credit was less vigorous in January that in December, but most other
types of consumer credit grew more strongly. Commercial banks accounted

rates at commercial banks held steady at a level about one-fifth

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. In foreign exchange markets during
the past four weeks, the dollar appreciated against the Canadian dollar,
Italian lira and Swiss franc and depreciated against the Japanese yen and
the European snake currencies, remaining virtually unchanged on a trade-
weighted average basis.
The recent announcements of a record U.S.
trade deficit and a decline in leading indicators in January had little
lasting impact on the dollar in exchange markets.
The Canadian dollar dropped 2-1/2 per cent during the past
four weeks, to a level of 95.37 cents.
.The two major factors
underlying the downward pressure on the Canadian dollar were a decline
in Canadian interest rates relative to U.S. rates and continuing uncertainty
about future political and economic developments in Canada, following
the Quebec election late last year. While U.S. interest rates have remained
little changed since early February, Canadian three-month interest rates
have dropped 25 basis points, and are expected to decline further, reflecting
the Bank of Canada's efforts to raise its M1 growth rate. The impact of
the political situation in Quebec was reflected in a drop in Cnandian
bond issues in the United States during January-February. Quebec, which
accounted for one fourth of Canada's $5-1/2 billion new issues in 1976,
has sold no new issues in the U.S. market so far this year.

IV- 2
The Italian lira came under downward pressure in late February,
following the easing of restrictions on capital outflows. Italy's foreign
currency purchase tax was removed and the non-interest-bearing import
deposit requirement was reduced from 25 per cent to 10 per cent. These
moves led to a substantial net private capital outflow,
The Swiss franc has dropped nearly 2 per cent since mid-February
and 4-1/2 per cent since the beginning of the year.
.The continued downward pressure on the Swiss franc probably
reflects the market's reassessment of the relative attractiveness of
franc-denominated financial assets. With interest yields on these assets
well below interest yields on financial assets elswwhere, their major
attraction was in the expectation of the continued appreciation of the
Swiss franc. The decline in the franc early this year, following a period
of fairly steady increase throughout 1976, may have altered this expec-
tation. Moreover, statements in the market that Swiss price inflation
may be higher this year than earlier anticipated have probably contributed
to this revision of expectations. Current projections of Swiss money
and income growth rates could be consistent with an inflation rate of
4 per cent or more in 1977, compared with 1.7 per cent in 1976.
The Japanese yen has appreciated against the dollar by about 1-1/2
per cent in the past four weeks, and nearly 4 per cent since the beginning

IV- 3
of the year. This appreciation reflects a substantial increase in Japan's
current-account surplus in January and the impact of various public and
official statements suggesting that the yen may be undervalued and should
be allowed to appreciate.
The pound dropped 1.3 per cent in mid-February, following the
announcement of a very large U.K. trade deficit and an acceleration of
price inflation in January. Most of that drop has been recovered since.
The Mexican peso has fluctuated in a narrow range against the
dollar during the past four weeks,
The price of gold has jumped $12.00 since mid-February to $148.25,
its highest level since September 1975. While no hard information is
available on shifts in underlying demand or supply conditions that could
explain this price increase, factors that have been cited in the market
include inflationary expectations, reports of increased industrial demand

IV- 4
and optimism following the market's relatively easy absorption of IMF
auction sales and reported sales by China, the Soviet Union and countries
that have received gold under the IMF restitution. At the seventh IMF
gold auction on March 2, the first on the new monthly schedule, 524,400
ounces were sold at an average price of $146.51 per ounce.
International capital markets. New medium-term credits arranged
in the Euro-currency market rose markedly in the fourth quarter of 1976
as developing countries borrowed more heavily, and for the full year 1976
new credits were almost 25 per cent greater than in the preceding year.
After a pause in January, activity in this market was up again very sharply
in February as several industrial countries raised large sums. In the
Euro-bond and foreign bond markets, new issue volume in the fourth quarter
of last year continued to run below the high rates of the first half of
1976. Subsequently, Euro-bond activity rose smartly early this year, but
sales of foreign bonds in national markets, especially in the U,S. market,
are lagging somewhat.
Medium-term Euro-credits of $8.0 billion in the fourth quarter
of 1976 were up about 40 per cent from the seasonally-low third quarter
and 30 per cent from the quarterly rate in the first half of last year.
Borrowings by industrial countries remained high, the principal loans
being those arranged by the U.K. Electricity Council ($500 million),
the government of Denmark ($400 million), the governments of Austria
and Ireland ($300 million each), and the government of South Africa

(two loans totalling $240 million). In 1976 the largest borrowers in
this market among the industrial countries were the United Kingdom ($2.2
billion and Spain ($1.7 billion) followed at some distance by Denmark,
France and South Africa ($700-800 million each). Borrowings by industrial
countries as a group in 1976 were nearly 50 per cent greater than in 1975,
although still only one-half of 1974's record amount.
Credits arranged by oil-exporting countries and non-oil developing
countries rose sharply in the fourth quarter of last year to rates sub-
stantially above those of the first half. A $1 billion 7-year credit
to Venezuela to refinance short-term debts dominated activity by the oil-
exporting countries. For the year, both Venezuela and Iran arranged $1
billion of credits, several times their 1975 borrowings; credits to Algeria
and Indonesia in 1976 were sizeable, but well below 1975 in the case of
Indonesia.
Mexico raised about $900 million in the fourth quarter, of
which $800 million in a 5- and 7-year two-tranche loan from a predominantly
North American syndicate, while Argentina received 4-year loans from
syndicates of U.S. banks ($500 million), Canadian banks ($66 million),
European banks ($312 million) and Japanese banks ($75 million) to restructure
its external debt. After lengthy negotiations the Peruvian Government
signed agreements in December for 5-year loans from syndicates of U.S.
banks ($210 million), Canadian banks ($30 million), and European banks
($90 million), of which one-half of each was drawn immediately and the
remainder in February. In early March Peru arranged dollar and yen loans
from Japanese banks for $33 million equivalent. Euro-credits announced

IV -7
for non-oil LDC's came to $10.6 billion last year, 38 per cent more than
in 1975. For the fourth consecutive year the largest borrowers in this
group were Brazil and Mexico ($2.3 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively);
other large borrowers in 1976, including the Philippines, Argentina, and
South Korea, also tended to be countries that have used the medium-Euro-
credit market for some time.
Loans to Socialist countries declined again in the fourth quarter,
and the $2.2 billion total of credits to those countries in 1976 was less
than in 1975. Legal uncertainties may hold back further loans to the two
Comecon banks in coming months.
Few Euro-credits were completed in January, but February was
extremely active with over $4-1/2 billion. The United Kingdom borrowed
$1.5 billion for seven years to bolster reserves; $1 billion is scheduled
to be drawn by mid-March. The Government of Sweden arranged a 7-year
loan of $1 billion as part of a program to borrow $2-3 billion in 1977,
the Caisse Nationale des Telecommunications in France arranged to borrow
$500 million for 7-8 years, Pemex of Mexico $300 million, and three loans
for a Brazilian steel plant totaled almost $500 million. The Swedish
and French loans carried an interest rate of 7/8 per cent over LIBO for
the first five years and 1 per cent for the remainder, the lowest spreads
since the current downtrend in spreads began last year. Another large
loan was a further credit to Venezuela, this time for $1.2 billion for
seven years.
Euro-bond issues rose seasonally in the fourth quarter but stayed
considerably below first-half levels. While total Euro-bond issues in the

IV -8
second half were down from the first half, issues by developing countries
increased notably, and for the year 1976 developing countries' issues
rose 2-1/2 times in volume to 9 per cent of total Euro-bonds compared
with 5 per cent the year before. Brazilian and Mexican issues accounted
for much of this rise. Total Euro-bond issues of $1.5 billion in January
were followed by about the same volume in February according to preliminary
data, indicating a return to a substantially higher level of activity this
year.
Foreign bond issues dipped in the fourth quarter and in the second
half of 1976 were down 15 per cent from the first half, reflecting lower
issues by Canadian borrowers and the World Bank. This decline was felt
primarily in the U.S. market. New foreign issues in January were at a
quarterly rate well below that of the fourth quarter.

IV -9
U.S. International Transactions. Among the major developments
in January, the merchandise trade deficit widened to a record $22.7
billion at an annual rate, there was a small net inflow of bank-reported
private capital after sizable outflows in December and in the fourth
quarter, sales of new foreign bonds in the United States dropped off,
and foreign official assets in the United States (other than OPEC funds)
declined, reversing the build-up in December.
In January, the United States had a record merchandise trade
deficit of $22.7 billion at an annual rate (international accounts
basis). This followed a December deficit rate of $15.5 billion (revised).
The sharply larger January deficit occurred as exports dropped back from
the unusually high December levels and imports were little changed.

The January decline in exports occurred largely in non-
agricuttural shipments and was concentrated in those commodities that
had increased sharply the previous month -- machinery, transportation
equipment (primarily aircraft), and chemicals. Only a small part of
the decline can be directly attributed to delivery or production
problems resulting from the unusually cold weather; the drop in coal
exports by $1.2 billion at an annual rate was the clearest example of
such reduced exports. Even so, the level of nonagricultural exports
in January, $94.3 billion at an annual rate, was about the same as in
November and both months were slightly stronger than the level of non-
agricultural exports in the third quarter. While new orders for
machinery exports declined in January, slow but continuing growth in
economic activity in other industrial countries, and continuing demand
from OPEC countries suggest a gradual rise in the value of U.S. non-
agricultural exports.
Exports to the developing countries dropped sharply in January
to a level lower than in any month in 1976, but exports to the major
industrial countries were still above the level of most of 1976, and
shipments to the smaller industrial countries have been gradually
increasing in recent months.
Agricultural exports declined slightly in January. The value
of wheat, corn, and rice exports all declined; with good wheat crops
and larger stocks around the world than in recent years, the volume
of wheat exports in January was the lowest since April 1972. However,

IV -11
the value of soybean and tobacco exports increased. The average price
paid for soybean exports rose to $7.26 per bushel, the highest since
February 1975.
Imports amounted to $139.3 billion at an annual rate in
January, about the same as in December and about 5 per cent higher than
the fourth quarter average. Fuel imports, on an international accounts
basis, fell by 4 per cent. This decline was entirely due to a sharp
drop from a record December volume of petroleum imports into the U.S.
Virgin Islands, mostly crude oil for a refinery on St. Croix. (Imports
into the U.S. Virgin Islands are not included in Census Bureau statistics
and recent press reports of rising oil imports in January referred just
to imports into the rest of the United States.) The quantity of oil
imported daily fell to 8.4 million barrels per day (mbd) from 8.8 mbd
in December. The average price of oil rose to $12.48 per barrel in
January from $12.35 in December and an average of $12.32 in the fourth
quarter of 1976.
Nonfuel imports rose to $98.7 billion at an annual rate in
January, 1-1/2 per cent above the December level and 6-1/2 per cent
higher than the fourth quarter rate. Increases in food imports (owing
to higher coffee and cocoa prices), iron and steel products, capital
goods, and consumer goods were partly offset by declines in other
industrial materials (largely nonferrous metals) and foreign-type cars
(as inventories reached a five-month high.)

IV -12
Bank-reported private capital transactions resulted in a
net inflow of $160 million in January -- a partial reversal of the
$1.8 billion outflow in December. Both claims on, and liabilities to,
foreigners were reduced sharply from their end-of-year peaks. U.S.
banks reduced their borrowings from their overseas branches by about
$2 billion in January, partly owing to reduced needs for funds and
partly to the cessation of certain year-end tax incentives to place
loans on head office books. The latter effect is most readily seen
in the $1.8 billion fall in January in bankers' acceptances held by
weekly-reporting banks. The reduction in bank-reported claims also
reflects a large withdrawal of year-end placements by U.S. offices
of foreign banks with banks abroad.
New foreign bond issues in the United States dropped to $400
million in January. Foreign issues expected in the first quarter
should amount to $1.65 billion -- $1.2 billion of Canadian issues
and $450 million of other foreign issues. This compares with fourth
quarter new issues of $2.3 billion.
Canadian issuers may find the U.S. market somewhat less
attractive in 1977 than last year, as the differential between Canadian
and U.S. interest rates has narrowed. In addition, Quebec Hydro and
the Province of Quebec have not yet appeared in the U.S. market this
year; last year they and the municipalities of Quebec accounted for
about 25 per cent of total Canadian borrowings in the United States.

IV -13
The uncertainty concerning Quebec's future political status
has been reflected in the bond markets: the spread between Ontario and
Quebec U.S. issues increased from 25 basis points prior to the pro-
vincial election to 105 basis points in February just after the visit
to the New York investment community by Quebec's Premier Levesque.
U.S. issues of the province of Ontario have only shown a slight
widening of spread against prime U.S. borrowers. At the end of February,
the province of Quebec successfully marketed $175 million in new issues
in Canada, its first long-term borrowing in the Canadian public capital
market since the provincial election in November. Given the large
capital needs of national resource development projects in the province,
it is likely that an effort will be made in the second quarter to re-
enter the U.S. markets.
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities dropped to under
$50 million in January (compared to a $750 million monthly average
in 1976). This drop reflected both the lull in offerings of new
foreign bonds and $300 million of redemptions of maturing securities
of the IBRD.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. stocks (excluding purchases by
OPEC) continued at a moderate rate in January. Amounting to $170 million,
they were slightly above December's rate and ran contrary to the usual
pattern of foreign net purchases in a rising market and net sales
in a declining market.

IV -14
OPEC reserve assets in the United States increased by $1.4
billion in January, an increase only slightly below that of the entire
second half of 1976. Recorded second half inflows from OPEC had been
low relative to the surpluses that were accumulated, but the January
increase does appear to reflect a rebuilding of liquidity positions
by some of the high absorption countries who benefited from the run-up
in oil demand for stockpiling in the latter part of 1976.
Foreign official assets in the United States (excluding OPEC)
decreased by $200 million in January.
A $400 million increase in U.S. reserve assets in January
largely corresponds to the increase in the United Kingdom drawing on the
IMF stand-by facility. Also includedwas a $60 million increase in U.S.
gold reserves as a result of IMF gold sales for "restitution" to
member countries; the counterpart of this transaction was a decrease
in the U.S. reserve position in the IMF. In February, total U.S. reserve
assets were little changed from the January level.

IV -15
Price Developments in Major Foreign Industrial Countries.
Price inflation rates in most of the major foreign industrial countries
remain high. During the course of 1976, consumer price increases showed
little tendency to decelerate, while wholesale price inflation rates tended
to accelerate in the first half of 1976 and then to decelerate in the
second. (See following table.) Inflation rates continue to vary widely
among the major countries, with Germany at one extreme and Italy at the
other.
Consumer price inflation in 1976 (December 1975 to December 1976)
was relatively moderate in Germany and Canada (4-6 per cent) but was at
or near double-digit rates for the rest of the major foreign industrial
countries. For this latter group, the rate of inflation ranged from about
10 per cent in France to 22 per cent in Italy. A disturbing feature of
consumer price performance in 1976 is that only the United Kingdom and,
to a lesser extent, Canada made substantial progress in reducing their
rates of inflation below those prevailing in 1975. Furthermore, in all
of the major foreign industrial countries except Germany, there has been
no significant and sustained decline in consumer price inflation from
first-half 1976 rates. With the exception of Switzerland, where consumer
prices are rising at an annual rate of less than 2 per cent, inflation
rates in the smaller industrial countries are mostly in the 7-10 per
cent range and are exhibiting little tendency to decline.
Wholesale price inflation was higher in 1976 than in 1975 in
almost all countries, but has moderated considerably in recent months
in all of the major foreign industrial countries except Italy and the
United Kingdom. Again individual country experience was diverse, with
Japan joining Canada and Germany with relatively moderate (5-6 per cent)

rates for 1976, and with rates in the remaining countries ranging from
France's 12 per cent to Italy's 32 per cent. Only in the United Kingdom
was there an improvement in wholesale price performance in 1976 relative
to that in 1975, and even the U.K.'s improvement was slight. The wide-
spread increases in wholesale price inflation rates were due in part to
a sharp increase in commodity prices during the year. Between December
1975 and December 1976, the Economist dollar index for all commodities
rose some 34 per cent. During the second half of 1976 pressure from
commodity prices abated somewhat as the index rose at an annual rate of
only 15 per cent, but the 49 per cent (annual rate) increase between
December and February could indicate renewed upward pressure on whole-
sale prices and eventually consumer prices as well.
To a large extent the disparity of inflation rates among the
major foreign industrial countries reflects the differing rates of
monetary growth that they have experienced during the last several years.
The monetary growth may have merely accommodated upward price pressures or
it may have been the actual initiator of the price changes; and in the
latter case the mechanism may have involved direct aggregate demand
effects or simply expectations effects. But in any case, as the follow-
ing table shows, those foreign countries with the lowest rates of infla-
tion in 1976 -- Canada and Germany -- have also had the lowest rates of
monetary growth, and the countries with the highest rates of inflation
have had the highest monetary growth rates. In fact, reading across the
table, the rankings are remarkably consistent.
Among other factors associated with recent inflationary exper-

industry rose 8 per cent whereas in Italy during the same period minimum
contractual wages, although not strictly comparable, grew by 27 per cent.
Wage increases such as those in Italy create a difficult choice between
unemployment and inflation for policy-makers, even where they reflect
mainly compensation for past or expected inflation rather than an auton-
omous wage-push. Thus, in some cases wage demands may have induced the
monetary expansion noted in the table. The European drought and the
general revival of world economic activity also put upward pressures on
prices during 1976. However, fairly strong growth in labor productivity,
particularly in the first half of 1976, eased price pressures somewhat.
Foreign industrial countries continue to consider inflation a
major policy problem. All countries are pursuing cautious demand-manage-
ment policies, despite the continued high levels of unemployment, and
many have incomes policies aimed at controlling wage and price increases
directly.
The dramatic acceleration of inflation in Italy during 1976 has
led the Italian government to adopt new anti-inflationary measures. In
particular, attention has been focussed on the wage indexation scheme
(the scala mobile) which automatically passes on nearly 100 per cent of
any change in the cost-of-living to money wages. However, the govern-
ment has been unsuccessful in fundamentally reforming the scala mobile
and has had to settle for some other changes: 1) an agreement between
industry and the unions to boost productivity; 2) the taking-over of
some employer social insurance payments by the government, to be paid
for by an increase in indirect taxes that will not be included in the
scala mobile index; and 3) a few minor reforms in the indexation scheme

IV -20
itself. The exclusion of the indirect tax increases from the scala
mobile index is being protested by some unions and their opposition
jeopardizes the change in social insurance payments. Average labor
costs -offset to an extent by strong productivity gains unlikely to
be repeated in 1977 -- are estimated to have grown 28 per cent in 1976,
but it is hoped that the above-mentioned measures will help to reduce
this figure in 1977. In addition, Italian macroeconomic policy has been
tightening. There have been substantial tax increases and the government
budget deficit should fall as a percentage of national income. Monetary
policy -- as indicated by the rate of increase in the monetary base --
tightened in 1976 and is expected to be somewhat restrictive this year.
However, despite these policy measures and the prospect of sluggish real
growth, most forecasters expect Italian inflation to be around 20 per cent
this year, with some deceleration toward the end of the year. A deprecia-
tion of the lira similar to that experienced last year would put consider-
ably more upward pressure on Italian prices.
In the United Kingdom, considerable progress was made in re-
ducing the rate of price inflation between 1975 and 1976. However, in
recent months inflation has accelerated again due in part to the decline
in the exchange value of the pound sterling last fall, some indirect tax
increases in January, and perhaps to the adverse expectations effects of
high money supply growth rates last summer and fall. The inflation rate
has increased despite the U.K.'s depressed level of economic activity
and its success at holding wage increases within the incomes policy's
limits. During the twelve months to December 1976, average earnings rose

IV -21
by 12 per cent compared with 15 per cent for consumer prices; labor
productivity in industry has been rising at an annual rate of about
3-5 per cent. If a third phase of the incomes policy satisfactory to
all sides can be worked out -- negotiations should begin in earnest in
April and are expected to result in a settlement -- it is likely that..
inflation will resume decelerating in the second half of 1977 since
the pound has been strong recently and monetary growth has been quite
low. Complementing the U.K.'s incomes policy are the prospect of sub-
dued real growth, a continued high level of unemployment, and the re-
strictive monetary and fiscal policy measures adopted in part as condi-
tions for a $3.9 billion IMF loan last December.
In Japan, the rate of increase in wholesale prices seems
already to have subsided after its increase in the first three quarters
of 1976, but consumer price inflation does not appear to be decelerating.
The Japanese government's response to this situation has been to maintain
an accommodative, but not a stimulative, monetary policy, and a fiscal
policy that is only moderately expansive. Although Japan has no formal
incomes policy, it does urge the unions and industry to hold wage in-
creases within certain limits. During 1976, wages and labor productivity
grew at about the same rate and the yen appreciated some 8 per cent.
Both of these factors eased Japanese price pressures in 1976 and may
continue to do so this year, although increased economic activity --
both domestic and foreign -- could result in inflation rates in 1977
not much lower than those experienced last year.
In France, consumer price inflation has declined in the three
months to January after accelerating to an annual rate of over 10 per
cent between the third and fourth quarters of 1976. The extremely

IV -22
volatile French wholesale price index has fluctuated widely. The decel-
eration in inflation in the three months to January reflects the price
freeze in effect between September and December, and a lowering of
indirect taxes in January. Hourly wages in the third quarter of 1976
were 15 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. The
government has now taken steps to limit the growth of wages in the pub-
lic sector to the rate of increase in the cost-of-living, but no similar
arrangement exists in the private sector. The French government is
attempting to reduce inflation by means of agreements with industry to
keep average price rises below certain limits and by following a
restrictive demand-management policy. The government budget deficit is
expected to be smaller in 1977 than in the two previous years -- both
absolutely and as a percentage of national income. Targeted money stock
growth and credit ceilings are intended to be moderately restrictive as
well. During 1977, French consumer price inflation is expected to de-
cline somewhat -- perhaps to 7-1/2 per cent (December over December).
Canada's improved price performance in 1976 can be attributed
in part to government policy measures. M1 growth has actually been even
below the announced target range and fiscal policy has aimed at keeping
the level of real government spending constant. In October 1975 -- in
response to the persistent nature of Canadian inflation -- the government
adopted an elaborate system of wage and price controls. This incomes
policy, along with the demand-management policies mentioned, may have
helped to improve price performance in Canada. However, much of the
improvement in 1976 was due to the virtual stability of food prices,
which are not subject to the controls. Wages do not appear to have

IV -23
been affected much by the incomes policy; between September 1975 and
September 1976 average wages (in manufacturing) grew by 13 per cent,
just as they did in the previous twelve months. The recent decline in
the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar, if sustained, could have an
adverse impact on Canadian inflation rates in 1977 and calls into
question the likelihood of any further deceleration of inflation
this year. On the other hand, real growth was sluggish in Canada
during the last three quarters of 1976, which may indicate that infla-
tion will continue to moderate.
Of the major foreign industrial countries, Germany has had
the most success in keeping general price movements under control. In-
deed, during the second half of 1976 both consumer and wholesale price
increases were under 2 per cent at an annual rate. (The "jump" in
consumer prices in January was due mostly to an increase in excise taxes.)
Although recent wage increases have been around 6-8 per cent (annual rate),
recent labor productivity gains have been within a few percentage points
of this figure and it is unlikely that wages will exert much upward
pressure on prices in 1977. Despite their success to date, the German
authorities continue to consider inflation to be a major problem and are
expected to press on in their attempt to establish general price stability.
To that end, the authorities plan to continue reducing the public sector
deficit and to enforce more rigidly the targets for monetary growth.
Germany has no formal incomes policy but the government periodically
meets together with business and labor to discuss wage and price develop-
ments.

IV -24
Among the small foreign industrial countries, price develop-
ments in Switzerland are the most interesting. Among the factors
contributing to Switzerland's extremely low rate of price inflation are
the external strength of the Swiss franc in 1976, the deep and prolonged
nature of the recession in Switzerland, modest wage increases, a policy
of price surveillance, and low rates of monetary growth in recent years.

RESULTS OF MOST RECENT SURVEY OF
CHANGES IN BANK LENDING PRACTICES AND SURVEY OF LOAN COMMITMENTS
The Survey of Changes in Bank Lending Practices taken at 121
large banks in mid-February suggests that the recent strength in business
loans reflects both a moderate upturn in demand and easier lending terms
at banks. While two-thirds of the respondents reported that business
loan demand was essentially unchanged as compared with three months earlier,
about one-fourth reported moderately stronger demand. For the last two
reporting periods taken together, over two-fifths of the respondents have
reported stronger demands for business loans. Moreover, more than half
the respondents in the February survey indicated that business loan demand
was expected to strengthen in the next three months, up from one-third in
November.
Easing of price and nonprice terms of lending was reported by
a growing minority of large banks. Somewhat over one-fourth of the respon-
dents reported moderately easier policy on interest rates for business
loans.1/ Further, the trend toward easing of compensating balance require-
ments has continued. During the six months covered by the February and
preceding November surveys, about one-third of the sample banks reported
easier policy toward compensating balances on business loans. There also
appears to be a significant trend toward easier policies on extending
term loans to business. One-third of the respondents reported easing
of policy in negotiating maturities of term loans during the last two
survey periods, and over one-half indicated that they were more disposed
to make such loans. Banks, however, report no easing in standards of
credit worthiness.
With regard to other types of loans covered in the Lending
Practices Survey, about 20 per cent of the respondents reported greater
willingness to make consumer instalment and single family mortgages loans.
Only modest easing was reported on the terms of lending to finance
companies and brokers.
The view that banks have become more aggressive in marketing
their business loan services gains support from the Monthly Loan Commit-
ments Survey taken at 135 large banks, including all of the 121 participants
in the Quarterly Lending Practices Survey. Unused commitments to businesses
rose by $1-3/4 billion in the second half of last year, when takedowns
totaled $2-1/4 billion. This implies that net new commitments extended
over this period totaled $4 billion.
1/ Interpretation of the responses is difficult since some banks consider
a cut in the prime rate to reflect easier policy, while others focus
on the relationship between the prime rate and open market rates.

and Statistics.

To determine the reasons for the recent growth in outstanding
commitments, an informal System survey of participants in the commitments
survey was conducted in the last week of February. Banks that lead
reported increases in unused commitments at the same time that takedowns
were large generally indicated that growth in commitments reflected aggres-
sive marketing efforts. Most reported a desire to increase their share
of the anticipated growth in business loans. Regional banks appeared to
be more successful in marketing new commitments than money center
institutions, reportedly because many firms do not see their credit demands
in the near term being so large that they need commitments from major
banks. Only a handful of respondents registering an increase both in
takedowns and in unused commitments indicated that their growth in commit-
ments reflected an underlying strengthening in demand for commitments.
