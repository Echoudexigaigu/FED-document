Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most  complete and accurate version available 
based on original copies culled from the f iles of the FOMC Secretariat at the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve Syst em.  This electronic document was created 
through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain. 
 Please note that some material may have b een redacted from this document if that

1  In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic 
format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing). 
 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optical character recognition computer program (OCR) 
first created electronic text from the document im age.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, 
staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.  Pl ease note that the numbers and text in charts and

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity continued to show considerable strength in
April, with substantial gains reported in production and employment.
Furthermore, residential construction activity surged during March, and
recent data indicate that conditions are favorable for continued growth
of business spending. However, prices rose sharply again last month.
Industrial production continues to expand at a vigorous rate;
the April growth is estimated tentatively to be about 3/4 per cent.
Output increases apparently were widespread among materials and final
products with the exception of auto production. Strikes at key GM and
Chrysler parts plants limited auto assemblies to a 9.3 million unit rate,
1 per cent below scheduled April production and 3 per cent below March
output. Production of business equipment continued to advance, and gains
were particularly strong among nondurable materials such as paper, textiles,
and chemicals.
As a result of these production advances, capacity utilization
in manufacturing is estimated to have risen marginally further in April
to 82.4 per cent--about 1-1/2 percentage points above the weather de-
pressed first quarter average. Materials utilization rates appear to be
rising somewhat faster than advanced processing, in part because of in-
creased steel production following a period of inventory liquidation.
However, current utilization rates for materials industries, at an
average of 81 per cent, are still well below historical norms and

12 percentage points below the 1973 peak. The only industry operating
near its practical maximum is petroleum refining where stocks are being
rebuilt and expanded following the exceptionally cold winter.
The continued vigor of economic activity was also evident in
April labor market developments. The establishment survey indicated
that nonagricultural payroll employment grew 270,000 in April, the sixth
consecutive month of increases greater than 200,000. Over 1-3/4 million
workers have been added to nonagricultural payrolls since last October.
Although increases were generally widespread in April, gains were
especially strong in nondurable manufacturing and contract construction.
Average weekly hours for production and nonsupervisory workers were un-
changed from March, and the factory workweek showed a mixed picture, as
average hours declined somewhat while overtime hours rose.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate dropped to
7.0 per cent in April, its lowest level since December 1974. Total
employment grew by more than one half million for the second consecutive
month. The decline in unemployment was concentrated among those who had
lost their last job.
Earlier gains in employment and hours are reflected in an
accelerated rise of personal income, which rose at a 19.9 per cent
annual rate in March. The rise of wage and salary income accelerated
to a 17.4 per cent annual rate in March, led by manufacturing payrolls
which grew at a 23.3 per cent rate. In addition, transfer payments in
March were swollen by the payment of earned income credits under the

Federal income tax law. In April, although the average workweek was
unchanged, the reported advances in employment and average hourly
earnings suggest continued gains in wage and salary income.
Consumer demand has continued to provide the principal
contribution to economic growth. Retail sales excluding autos and
mainly nonconsumer items are estimated to have risen 1.1 per cent in
April, about the same as in March. Sales of general merchandise ad-
vanced 2-1/2 per cent last month.
Auto sales, though somewhat below their advanced March pace,
remained strong last month. Unit sales in April were at an 11.6 million
annual rate--one half million above the first quarter average. Imports
sold at a record rate for the second straight month, taking an appre-
ciably larger share of the total market. The recent surge in foreign
model sales has resulted in part from widespread discounts and may
have reflected renewed consumer interest in smaller sized foreign cars
in anticipation of higher gasoline prices.
Domestic autos sold at a 9.3 million unit rate in April,
equal to the selling pace of the first quarter. Interest in large cars
continued to dominate, while domestic subcompacts fared poorly in the
market. Trade reports suggest that sales of large cars surged following
the Administration's proposal to penalize purchases of such models in
the near future.

confidence was slightly lower in late March and early April than in the

two previous bimonthly surveys, the index still remains within the
range reported over the last 12 months. Moreover, the volatile buying
plan index was about unchanged as weaker buying plans for autos and
homes were offset by a sharp increase in intentions to buy major
appliances.
Along with increased household spending, substantial demand
for housing has led to strong advances in residential construction.
Private housing starts advanced 17 per cent in March from an upward
revised February level, reaching an annual rate of 2.1 million units--
the highest since 1973. As a result of the March performance, the
weather-induced January slump was offset and the first quarter starts
rate held about even with the advanced fourth quarter pace. Single-
family starts rose to an extremely high 1.5 million unit annual rate
and multifamily starts rose sharply in March from earlier reduced levels.
Nearly all of the recent increase came in conventionally financed units,
in contrast to the fourth quarter when multifamily starts were boosted
by a surge in public funds for subsidized housing. Combined sales of
new and existing homes were again vigorous in March and, despite a
reduced rate of savings inflows, thrift institutions supplied a sub-
stantial volume of mortgage credit at unchanged interest rates.
Conditions appear favorable for further growth of business
spending, the principal lagging sector since the recovery began. Real
outlays for business fixed investment advanced at a 14.4 per cent rate
in the first quarter, with the pattern of gains still affected by

special factors. The first quarter increase was concentrated in the
motor vehicle and farm equipment categories, which had been held back
by strikes in the fourth quarter of 1976. Excluding these, real
producers durable equipment expenditures were about unchanged from the
fourth quarter.
There are signs, however, that components of capital spending
other than motor vehicles and farm equipment will be picking up later
in the year. The McGraw-Hill spring survey of anticipated plant and
equipment expenditures--conducted in late March and early April--shows
business planning to increase capital spending by 18 per cent in 1977,
with particular strength in durable manufacturing and utilities. This
is 3 percentage points greater than the figure reported by a special
check-up taken two months earlier and 5 percentage points above the
results of their fall survey. These new results are considerably more
optimistic than the February Commerce survey which showed business
planning an 11.7 per cent increase for 1977. However, the two surveys
are not directly comparable; the Commerce survey is based on a more
comprehensive sample and is adjusted for systematic anticipations bias.
Capital spending commitments data have also strengthened.
New orders for nondefense capital goods rose 2.9 per cent in March,
offsetting the February decline and bringing the first quarter rise
up to 6.2 per cent. Additionally, construction contracts for commercial

and industrial building measured by floor space rose over 30 per cent
(not an annual rate) in March. For the first quarter as a whole, this
volatile series was at its highest level since late 1974.
Recent data suggest a further accumulation of business
inventories in the coming months. The book value of manufacturers'
stocks rose at an $8.6 billion annual rate in March, less than in
January or February. A sharp rise in shipments may have caused stocks
of finished goods to fall. The net addition to stocks was wholly in
materials and supplies--usually indicative of increasing production.
The inventory-sales ratio for manufacturers fell sharply further in
March, indicating that stocks remain lean; the ratio for producers of
durable goods declined in March to its lowest level in 11 years.
Greater accumulation in April may be suggested by the recent behavior
of business loans at commercial banks--a principal means of inventory
financing--which remained at a high level.
Another lagging sector has been the spending by State and
local governments, and here weakness persists. Value of construction
put-in-place rose by $.8 billion (annual rate) in March following a
$2 billion rate in February. For the quarter as a whole, such spending
is estimated to have been $1.6 billion (annual rate) below the depressed
fourth quarter rate. Employment growth registered a moderate gain in
April (11,000 jobs) but the increases of the last two months have just
barely offset the decreases experienced earlier this year.

Federal spending in March was $34.6 billion in terms of the
unified budget--up nearly $3.7 billion from February's depressed level.
Spending for the second quarter is expected to be quite strong. The
Administration has revised downward its fiscal year 1977 Federal deficit
estimate from $68 billion to $49 billion. Approximately $11.4 billion
of this decline is due to the withdrawal of the Administration's rebate
proposal and $6.0 billion is due to smaller-than expected spending in
the areas of national defense and grants for education, highways, and
waste treatment.
Wholesale and consumer prices have continued to rise rapidly
in recent months. Large increases in prices of farm products and foods
were mainly responsible for the further sizable rise in the Wholesale
Price Index for April. Prices of fresh fruits and vegetables declined
with improved supplies in April but prices of soybeans, livestock,
manufactured animal feeds, and dairy products rose substantially.
Prices of industrial commodities rose at a 7-1/2 per cent
per year rate; the rise is over a percentage point less if fuels and
power are excluded--about the average rate of the past 12 months.
Among fuels and power, large increases were reported for natural gas
and electricity, both of which are reported with a lag. A sizable
decline--the second in three months--came in lumber and wood product
prices which had soared in late 1976. The March increase in the
consumer prices was at about a 7-1/2 per cent annual rate. Food prices

slowed to about a 7 per cent rate as supplies of fresh vegetables
began to recover from the cold weather snap and beef and egg prices
declined. Coffee prices, however, continued to soar. Energy prices
continued to rise at retail, although the increase for gasoline was
less than in the previous month. Excluding the food and energy items
from the CPI the rise for March was at a 6.3 per cent annual rate--again,
about the same as over the last 12 months.
Private business sector unit labor costs increased at a
7.3 per cent annual rate in the first quarter. The small deceleration
from the 8.0 per cent rate in the fourth quarter is attributable to
improved productivity growth and came despite a larger increase in
hourly compensation (10.7 per cent rate). The large rise in hourly
compensation in the first quarter was partly due to increased taxes on
employers for social security and unemployment insurance, and to
minimum wage adjustments in some sectors. Also in the first quarter,
first-year wage adjustments in major collective bargaining settlements
averaged 7.6 per cent, compared to the 1976 average of 8.4 per cent.
There were, however, relatively few negotiations concluded in the first
quarter. In April, the average hourly earnings index for production and
nonsupervisory workers in the private nonfarm economy rose at a 6.8 per
cent annual rate, about the same as the average increase during 1976 as
a whole.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Aggregate private credit demands continued to strengthen
in April while Treasury demands moderated. The maturity composition
of private borrowing shortened further, as coprorate bond offerings
slowed while short-term borrowing by businesses and municipalities
rose sharply.
Commercial bank credit expanded substantially further
in April, about matching the advanced first quarter rate. An un-
usually large proportion of the April expansion was financed by demand
deposit growth, as M1 increased at a record rate. Growth of time
and savings deposits at commercial banks and nonbank thrift
institutions, on the other hand, slowed somewhat further.
Market interest rates have generally increased since the
April FOMC meeting, responding to a rise of the Federal funds rate--
from the 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 per cent range into the 5-1/4 per cent area--
which occurred against a background of a sharp acceleration of M1
growth and evidence of considerable strength in economic activity.
Upward pressures on other rates have been tempered, however, as the
Treasury has been reducing its indebtedness through paydowns in
weekly and monthly bill auctions and in the mid-May refunding, and

III -2
has announced its intention to continue allowing bills to run off
over the remainder of the quarter. In addition, inventory positions
of U.S. Government securities dealers have been quite low, reflecting
preparation for the Treasury's May refunding as well as positioning
in expectation of rising rates.
On balance, increases in market rates since the last
Committee meeting generally have been less than the rise in the
Federal funds rate. Specifically, rate on Treasury bills and inter-
mediate-term issues have moved up around 30 to 45 basis points, and
commercial paper rates have advanced 25 to 40 basis points. Yields
on Treasury and corporate bonds show gains of about 15 to 20 basis
points, while those on municipal bonds and home mortgages are up
only marginally.
With these recent increases, most short- and long-term
market interest rates are now 50 to 70 basis points above their
levels near the end of 1976, which were the lowest in recent years.
Average yields on municipal bonds, in fact, are still slightly below
their December levels, reflecting declining yields on lower-quality
issues, and rates on home mortgages in the primary market are only
about 15 basis points above their recent low reached in March.
Intermediate-term Treasury rates have shown substantially larger
gains this year, but this reflects a rebound from the especially
sharp decline that occurred in late November and December.

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 increased at a record seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 19-1/2 per cent in April. This sharp rise produced an
acceleration in M2 and M3 growth, despite the continued moderation
of interest-bearing deposit inflows to banks and thrift institutions.
But the broader measures of money expanded less than M for the
first time since money market rates fell below ceiling rates on
savings deposits about a year ago.
While a number of special factors 1/ contributed to the
spurt in demand deposits in April, they cannot account fully for the
rapid growth in the narrow money stock. Some of the increase may
have been associated with increasing transactions demand for money
accompanying the continued gains in economic activity. M1 growth
had been relatively modest in the first quarter, and the April
expansion could reflect in part lagged adjustment of transactions
balances to strengthening economic activity. Historically, such
rapid growth of money balances in one month is usually followed by
much slower growth, and early data for May suggest that this pattern
is being repeated.
1/ Social security checks were distributed earlier than usual because
the normal payment date fell on a Sunday; as a result, some
portion of the $6.5 billion April payment lodged in demand
balances longer than is customary. A similar development in
October 1976 also led to a sharp increase in M1 in that month.
In addition, the Treasury's cash balance declined sharply in
late March and early April, tending to stimulate private demand
deposits. Finally, mid-April tax payments by individuals were
$2.5 billion larger than in either of the previous two years,
and there appears to have been some shift from interest-bearing
deposits to demand deposits prior to the tax date and some
subsequent delay in processing the large volume of tax payments.
Both of these factors led to an increase in private demand balances
in the two weeks surrounding the tax date.

Growth of the interest-bearing components of both M2 and
M3 slowed further in April from their reduced first quarter pace. At
commercial banks, some of the recent slowdown in savings and other
time deposits has occurred in California, where political subdivisions
have been placing a larger share of their liquid assets into a State
Pooled Investment Fund, under authority effective January 1977; staff
estimates suggest that these shifts may have reduced interest-bearing
bank deposits by over $1 billion by mid-April. At thrift institutions,
there appear to have been more widespread cuts in offering rates on
1/longer-term time deposits. -More generally, it is likely that a
portion of the unusually large personal income tax payments made in
April was financed from interest-bearing deposits at banks and thrifts.
And, in recent months the rapid increases in consumer expenditures may
have been associated with a slowdown in net acquisitions of interest-
bearing financial assets.
Managed liabilities of large banks changed little in April.
Outstanding negotiable CD's were allowed to run off further, and bank-
1/ A survey conducted by the National Association of Mutual Savings
Banks in February showed significant declines in the number of
banks offering the highest possible interest rates on 4- to 6-
year accounts. Discussions with observers of the savings and loan
industry suggest that similar developments have occurred in that
industry, although data for recent months are not available.

III -7
related commercial paper declined by about $400 million. On the
other hand, banks apparently continued to increase their borrowing
in the Federal funds and RP markets. As shown in the chart, large CD's
of weekly reporting banks have declined with only minor interruptions
since the end of 1975. The net increase in borrowings in the Federal
funds and RP markets since then has more or less balanced the CD run-
off, and the total volume of managed liabilities has changed only
slightly, except for a temporary buildup around the end of 1976.
Growth in total bank loans and investments in April (last
Wednesday of the month series) advanced further from the relatively
rapid first quarter pace. While banks reduced their holdings of
U.S. Government issues, in line with the Treasury's paydown of bills,
their holdings of tax-exempt securities rose sharply for the first
time since November. Although a large portion of these acquisitions
reflected tax anticipation notes, particularly those of New York
State, banks in most parts of the country increased their holdings
of both long- and short-term municipal securities.
All major loan categories at banks showed significant
further expansion in April. Real estate loans continued to grow
at the advanced March rate, and although April data are not yet
available, it is likely that consumer loans at banks rose sharply
again last month.

Business Credit
Business firms further reduced their reliance on long-
term markets in April and continued to increase their demands for
short-term credit. Total gross offerings of bonds and equities
(not seasonally adjusted) by corporations in April were almost
20 per cent belowthe first quarter rate, while short-term borrow-
ing expanded sharply.
Short-term business borrowing. Growth of business loans
at banks picked up further in April, following strong increases
during the two previous quarters. 1/ As in March, however, most
of the strength in business loans was at the smaller banks.
The relative weakness of business loans at larger banks
accompanied a sharp rise in commercial paper issuance by
nonfinancial corporations. Total commercial paper outstanding
rose $2.5 billion in April, the largest increase since January
1974. Nearly three-fourths of this increase was by financial firms
(line 4 of the table), and was associated primarily with the
financing of autos and a wide variety of consumer goods. But non-
financial commercial paper (line 5) also increased by the greatest
amount in 2-1/2 years. A number of large industrial corporations
are reported to have returned to this market for relatively cheaper
short-term funds after long absences during which internal funds
1/ Bank holdings of acceptances also increased slightly during
April, in contrast to the runoff during the first quarter.

or proceeds from the longer-term debt and equity markets financed
their needs. 1
Total short-term business credit--as measured by total
business loans at banks plus nonfinancial commercial paper--rose at
an 18 per cent annual rate in April (memoranda item 4 in the table on
page 111-9). Data on business loans at finance companies are not
available beyond March, when such loans increased at a 19 per cent annual
rate.
Long-term business credit. Gross public and private
corporate bond offerings moderated to about $3.0 billion in April,
15 per cent below the first quarter pace. As shown in the table,
virtually all of the slowdown in bond offerings reflected lower public
2/offerings of bonds. -Private placements, on the other hand, are
estimated to be continuing at near-record levels. Outstanding bond
commitments at life insurance companies--the dominant purchasers of
private placements--reached an all-time high at the end of March.
With stock prices continuing low relative to corporate
earnings, new stock offerings have been quite modest in recent
months. April offerings fell to $450 million--the smallest
monthly total since late 1974.
1/ Foreign issues accounted for an estimated $200 million of the
increase in nonfinancial commercial paper during April. In the
first quarter, foreign commercial paper outstanding increased by
an estimated $100 million.
2/ Moreover, if refunding operations of several major utilities--
amounting to $645 billion--are excluded, seasonally adjusted
public offerings of corporate bonds during the January-April
period were at the lowest pace since early 1974.

Other Securities Markets
Gross offerings of long-term municipal bonds totaled
$3.4 billion in April, the ninth consecutive month in which
they have exceeded offerings for the same momth of any other year.
Underwriters report that large issuers have been borrowing at
longer-term in recent months in anticipation of higher rates in the
latter part of 1977, 1/ and relatively favorable yield levels also
have encouraged an unusually large volume of advance refunding of
municipal bonds-$4.8 billion since last September.
Short-term municipal issues in April were the largest
on record. The increase was due primarily to issuance of $3.6 billion
in tax anticipation notes by New York State as part of its normal
spring financing requirements.
In April and the first half of May, the Treasury repaid
a net total of $1.8 billion of marketable debt on an issuance basis,
primarily by paying down bills. Thus, the net change in such debt
over this period was roughly equal to the total paydown in market-
able debt the Treasury has said that it intends to make over the
current quarter. The Treasury's plans over the remainder of the
quarter, as publicly announced, include further decreases in bill
issuance to be offset by money raised in conjunction with auctions
of its regular cycle notes.
1/ The issuer can then invest the proceeds in market instruments
which, of course, carry taxable yields significantly above those
in the tax-exempt market.

The issues sold in the Treasury's mid-May refunding opera-
tion--involving repayment of $0.4 billion of maturing debt and issuance
of $3.85 billion in new securities--were well received. On May 3,
the Treasury auctioned $2.85 billion of 6-3/4 year notes at an
average rate of 7.28 per cent; on May 4, an average rate of 7.77 per
cent was set in an auction of $1 billion of 29-3/4 year bonds.
Dealers were awarded about half of the new issues, and noncompetitive
tenders totaled $1.0 billion.
Mortgage Markets
Net mortgage lending during the first quarter of 1977 was
near the record rate of the previous quarter. Moreover, indications
are that mortgage loan volume remained quite large in April. Issues
of GNMA-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities in April remained around
the strong pace of the two previous quarters and, as noted earlier,
mortgage loans outstanding at commercial banks continued to grow
at the advanced March rate. Mortgage commitments outstanding (in-
cluding loans in process) at all savings and loan associations--the
major mortgage lender--at the end of March were about 4 per cent above
the December level.1/
Mortgage lending has remained highly concentrated in the
single-family housing sector. In the multifamily sector, it has risen
only slightly in recent quarters with the uptrend of apartment-house
1/ Outstanding commitments declined by $100 million in January, rose by
$300 million in February, and increased by $900 million in March.
The March surge was partly a reaction to the slowdown earlier in the
quarter when severe weather conditions caused delays in construction
and home sales.

III -17
construction. However, by the end of February (latest data available),
outstanding commitments to provide long-term multifamily mortgage funds
at major lender groups were 40 per cent above their depressed year-
earlier level. While still little more than half the peak reached in
1973, the increase suggests growth in this sector of the mortgage market
in the months ahead. Moreover, commitment activity is likely to pick
up further, as rental vacancy rates have fallen significantly in many
areas of the country, while completions of multifamily units have been
quite low.
Average interest rates on new commitments for conventional
home mortgages at savings and loan associations have continued to edge
up from their cyclical low in early March. Yields in the secondary
mortgage market, which had declined significantly in mid-April, have
since risen to around the levels prevailing at the end of March.
The volume of bids rose sharply in the May 2 FNMA auction of commitments
to purchase FHA/VA mortgages in the wake of decreases in prices of
GNMA-guaranteed securities.
Consumer Credit Markets
Consumer instalment lending accelerated during the first
quarter. The annual growth rate in outstanding credit was 15 per
cent for the quarter and 18 per cent for March--up from a steady
10 to 11 per cent pace throughout 1976. The first quarter increase in
consumer debt exceeded 2 per cent of disposable personal income for
the first time since early 1973.

About two-fifths of the growth in instalment credit in the
first quarter was associated with an expansion in retail sales of
goods most frequently purchased with credit (e.g., autos, furniture
and appliances). The remaining increase was due to more intensive
use of credit by consumers for general expenditures purposes.
Automobile credit paced the March expansion in consumer
credit outstanding, and bank-card credit posted its largest gain on
record. Commercial bank holdings of all types of consumer instalment
credit increased substantially in March, as banks accounted for more
than half of the net change in total instalment credit outstanding,
compared with about two-fifths in other recent months.
The pickup in instalment credit growth in the first quarter
occurred with little change in consumer finance rates. However, auto
loan maturities have continued to lengthen. Nearly 40 per cent of all
new-car loans granted by banks and finance companies in March had
maturities exceeding 36 months, compared with one-fourth a year earlier.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. The dollar showed little net change
on a weighted-average basis during the past four weeks, with a rise against
the Japanese yen about offset by a slight decline against the snake currencies,
and with little movement against other major currencies.
In mid-April, the yen dropped more than 2 per cent against the
dollar, abruptly reversing its fairly steady 9 per cent appreciation since
last December. The sudden decline in the yen was precipitated by news of
a U.S. Customs Court ruling against Japanese consumer electronic products.
The announcement took place in an atmosphere of market concern about the
implications for Japan's trade position of growing protectionist pressures
in its major industrial trading partners. Another, and perhaps more important
factor stimulating the yen's decline was a 1 percentage point cut in the
Bank of Japan's discount rate, which was soon followed by declines in other
short-term Japanese interest rates.
The dollar fluctuated in a fairly wide range against the snake
currencies during the past four weeks, ending the period down 1/4 per
cent, on average. The major factor contributing to the dollar's weakness
against these currencies during this period was the announcement of a

IV -2
record U.S. trade deficit for March and the first quarter. This announce-
ment was made at about the same time that data were released showing the
continuation of a large trade surplus for Germany. The dollar later recovered
partially from the news of the U.S. trade deficit, with the rise in U.S.
short-term interest rates.
Within the snake, there was substantial upward pressure on the
guilder against the mark.
.The pressure on the
guilder arose mainly from speculation in the market that the guilder would
be revalued within the snake, based on the Netherlands' relatively strong
current account position. There was also a flow of funds into long-term
Dutch assets at relatively attractive interest rates, which were expected
to decline and yield a capital gain to investors. The pressure on the guilder
eased late last week after the Netherlands Bank lowered its discount rate
from 4-1/2 per cent to 3-1/2 per cent.
The Swiss franc declined slightly against the dollar, on balance,
during the past four weeks. The Swiss franc came under strong but tem-
porary downward pressure following news reports of large loan losses by
the Swiss Credit Bank, one of Switzerland's three largest commercial banks.

IV -3
.U.K. wholesale price inflation rose in
April, and Britain's trade unions have indicated a reluctance to agree
to a continuation of that country's incomes policy. There have also been
several further reductions in Britain's Minimum Lending Rate, totalling
1 percentage point during the past four weeks. The MLR now stands at
8-1/4 per cent.
In mid-April, the United Kingdom sold nearly $700 million equiva-
lent of foreign-currency-denominated bonds to holders of official sterling
balances. This amounted to nearly 1/5 of total foreign official holdings
of sterling. Of the total official sterling balances outstanding at that
time, about half were considered by the Bank of England to be relatively
stable "working balances" of foreign central banks.
The System has sold small to moderate amounts of marks and guilders
in support of the dollar to counter disorderly market conditions on several
occasions during the past four weeks. These operations totalled $22 million
equivalent. The System has also made repayments on the Swiss franc swap
debt totalling $42.5 million, reducing the outstanding debt to $849 million.
The price of gold has fluctuated in a range between $146 and $152
an ounce during the past four weeks. It ended the period at $147.50, down
$2.20 from the end of the previous green book reporting period. At the
IMF's ninth gold auction on May 4, the average price of successful bids
was $148.02 an ounce, down $1.16 from the price at last month's auction.

IV -4
OPEC investment flows. The OPEC current account surplus appears
to have been about $10 billion in the first quarter of 1977, not much dif-
ferent from the revised estimate for the fourth quarter of 1976. The average
price of OPEC oil increased in the first quarter, by an estimated 8-1/2 per
cent. However, oil production declined because of lower demand early in the
quarter, bad weather in the Persian Gulf that hampered loadings, and the
reduced number of days in the quarter. The investible surplus (current
account surplus less net credits to oil companies due to the settlements lag)
appears to have been about $9-1/2 to $10 billion -- higher than in any of the
quarters of 1976 when OPEC credits to oil companies ran larger than in early
1977 and cut more deeply into the investible surpluses. The estimate of the
1976 investible surplus has been revised downward sharply to about $30 bil-
lion as a result of both a downward revision of the current account balance
and an upward revision of the amount of net credits extended to the oil
companies.
OPEC investments (official and private) in bank deposits and
securities in the United States came to $2.6 billion in the first quarter,
more than the $2.1 billion comparable inflow in the entire second half of
1976. But the share of this total that consisted of longer-term assets
continued to decline. Purchases of longer-term assets fell to $0.9 billion
in the first quarter, compared with an average of $1.35 billion per quarter
in the second half of last year (and a higher rate in the first half of 1976
when proceeds of some direct disinvestment were being reinvested). Net OPEC

purchases of U.S. equities and of corporate and Federal agency bonds have
both declined sharply this year from levels in the second half of 1976, while
purchases of Treasury bonds have held up quite well.
Total OPEC investment in the United States in the first quarter
presumably exceeded the $2.6 billion of banking and portfolio acquisitions,
since other types of investments have been sizable in the past and are
estimated to have totalled $3.7 billion in each of the years 1975 and 1976.
However, estimates of these latter flows in the first quarter of 1977 are
not yet available.
In January and February the OPEC countries ceased to draw down
further their liquid sterling assets in the United Kingdom. Such withdrawals
had amounted to $1.1 billion last year, almost all of them occurring before
the fourth quarter. In April the British Government sold £ 394 million
($678 million equivalent) of foreign-currency-denominated (mostly dollar)
bonds to official holders of sterling balances, and OPEC governments were
presumably important purchasers.
Among other OPEC investments in the first quarter, estimated net
placements in the Euro-currency markets in January-February were substantial
at $3.3 billion, while lending to international institutions continued to
be very small.

IV -7
The $30 billion OPEC investible surplus now estimated for 1976
reflects substantial changes in previous estimates of many components of the
current account. Compared with earlier figures, the latest data show higher
levels of merchandise imports (especially in the second half), of net imports
of services, and of OPEC grant aid than was previously estimated. These
changes result in a significantly lower figure of about $37-1/2 billion
for the current account balance as measured with oil receipts on an accrual
basis. Further reducing the investible surplus from levels estimated earlier
is the larger figure for net credit to oil companies, now estimated for 1976
as a whole at close to $7-1/2 billion. These net credits arose because, in
consequence of the settlements lag, cash receipts from oil sales during
1976 did not fully reflect increases between the fourth quarter of 1975 and
the fourth quarter of 1976 of about 26 per cent in the volume of oil exports
and 0.6 per cent in average oil prices.

U.S. International Transactions in the first quarter resulted
in a considerable increase in the trade deficit, to a rate three times
the quarterly average of 1976. Private bank and security market trans--
actions in the first quarter generated a capital outflow considerably
smaller than the quarterly average in 1976. Foreign official capital
transactions were dominated by an increase in U.K. reserve assets in
the United States; reserve accumulations by OPEC were also large--
at a rate well above that of the second half of 1976.

The U.S. deficit on merchandise trade was $28 billion
(seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the first quarter, compared with
a fourth quarter deficit of $14 billion. The March trade deficit was
$33.5 billion.
The value of nonagricultural exports declined slightly in
the first quarter. The decline was in volume, as prices were unchanged,
and was largely concentrated in exports of civilian aircraft. Con-
tributing factors to the continued sluggish behavior of U.S. non-
agricultural exports were the persistence of substantial unused pro-
ductive capacity in the industrialized countries and the continuation
of a period of slower economic growth among most of the major develop-
ing countries.
The value of agricultural exports increased in the first
quarter of 1977 by 3 per cent over the fourth-quarter rate to $24.4
billion. In March, agricultural exports were 10 per cent above the fourth
quarter rate. The rise in the volume and value of cotton, tobacco,
and soybean shipments offset reduced volumes of grain shipments. The
sharp surge in soybean export prices -- $7.79 per bushel in March com-
pared with $6.81 per bushel in December, 1976-- reflects the shortfall
of the actual from the anticipated world supply of fats and oils,
including soybeans.
The value of imports in the first quarter rose by almost
$13 billion over the fourth-quarter rate to $146 billion. Slightly
over half of the increase was in nonfuel imports, which rose by

-10-
9 per cent. The largest increases were in imports of foods ($2.5
billion), consumer durables ($1.7 billion), and American-type cars
from Canada ($1.2 billion). Higher prices and volumes of coffee
imports accounted for most of the rise in food imports -- the value of
coffee imports increased by $1.8 billion. The increase in the volume
of coffee imports may well have reflected the stockpiling efforts
of domestic roasters who were expecting further increases in the
price of coffee. The rise in non-automotiveconsumer durable products
was largely from Japan and the developing countries in Asia.
Imports of fuel were $57 billion in March (S.A.A.R.) and
$47 billion in the first quarter of 1977. Petroleum imports were
9.3 million barrels per day in the first quarter, 1 million barrels
per day above the rate in the fourth quarter of 1976. The rise of
petroleum imports in the first quarter reflected increased current
domestic consumption and stock replenishment due to the severe cold
winter -- including probably the involuntary substitution by industry
of imported petroleum for natural gas -- and a continued decline in
domestic production. In addition, about one-fifth of the first-quarter
increase in the volume of petroleum imports may represent an accelera-
tion in the importing of distillate fuel to take advantage of a February/
March FEA import subsidy of 5 cents per gallon.
Bank-reported private capital transactions resulted in a net
outflow of $2 billion dollars in March. The net outflow for the first
quarter was $1.9 billion, well below the $4.2 billion outflow in the

fourth quarter.
The $1.2 billion increase in March in U.S. banking offices'
net claims on foreign banks occurred as the U.S. offices of Canadian
and Swiss banks took advantage of profitable interest arbitrage op-
portunities that coincided with a stabilization of Canadian interest
rates and an upward movement in Swiss interest rates relative to U.S.
interest rates. The sharp upturn in Swiss call rates in the latter
part of March took place because the Swiss National Bank, concerned
about monetary growth above its target in the first two months, chose
to limit the availability of the swap facilities, contrary to previous
practice. The swap facilities are provided by the Swiss National
Bank to aid banks in meeting their end-of-quarter liquidity require-
ments.
Bank-reported acceptance and collection claims on foreigners
increased by $1 billion in March. The increase is banker's acceptances
reflects the hedging behavior of Japanese trading companies who by
borrowing dollars protected themselves from an expected sharp ap-
preciation of the yen.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities
provided an inflow of $1 billion in the first quarter. The inflow
largely reflected portfolio restructuring by the World Bank, which
sold CDs, other short-term bank liabilities, and Treasury bills to
purchase long-term Treasury issues.

-13-
Other private securities transactions resulted in a $100
million net inflow during the first quarter, a swing of $2.3 billion
from the outflow recorded in the fourth quarter. New issues of
foreign securities in the United States of $1.3 billion were $1
billion less than the fourth quarter. New issues in the second quarter
are likely to be between $1.7 and $2.2 billion -- including a World
Bank issue of $600 million. Foreign net purchases of U.S. stocks
(excluding OPEC purchases) continued at a moderate rate in March.
Amounting to $100 million, they brought first quarter net purchases
of U.S. stocks by foreigners to slightly under $400 million.
OPEC reserve assets in the United States increased by $2.5
billion in the first quarter,
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States
(excluding OPEC) increased by $2.2 billion in the first quarter.

Economic Activity in Foreign Industrial Countries. Economic
activity abroad has increased only moderately since the spurt in the
first quarter of last year, although activity appears to have accele-
rated somewhat in the fourth quarter in Germany, Italy and the United
Kingdom, Private investment spending remains weak in virtually all
countries, with recent gains in output stemming mainly from increases
in consumption and -- in the case of Japan -- export growth. In none
of the major countries abroad are there currently signs of a vigorous
upswing in economic activity.
Table I summarizes recent movements in industrial production
for the six major foreign countries. Only two of the six countries
(Germany and Italy) have surpassed their pre-recession peak-month in
industrial output. While France and Japan are close to their peaks,
the United Kingdom and Canada are still substantially below their peaks.
Table II shows national accounts data through the fourth
quarter of last year. Except for Canada (where a large increase in the
external deficit contributed to negative growth in the fourth quarter
of 1976), all of the countries (excluding France, for which data are
not yet available) experienced higher rates of growth in real GNP/GDP
in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Preliminary data for
Japan indicate that real GNP increased at an annual rate of 5.2 per
cent in the first quarter of this year, as compared with 2.4 per cent
in the previous quarter.

Although there have been moderate gains in the number of
employed workers in most countries since early 1976, the labor force
has also grown, so that unemployment rates have remained high by
historical standards. But, since the rate of increase in prices is
still at unacceptably high levels in most countries, governments have
been cautious in undertaking expansionary measures.
At the recent London summit meeting, it was agreed that the
seven countries would continue to adhere to economic policies aimed at
reducing the rate of inflation and achieving their stated growth targets.
The leaders also agreed to expand their efforts to create more jobs
and to encourage international trade, free of protectionist tendencies.
Recent forecasts of real growth in the major countries predict
rather moderate rates of growth in the first half of this year and
some acceleration in growth in the second half of 1977.
The German economic performance has been irregular since the
spring of last year. Real GNP increased 5.7 per cent in 1976 over the
previous year, and most forecasts for this year call for a rate of
growth in the 4 to 5 per cent range. Several factors have contributed
to the decline in optimism regarding German economic activity this year.
There are now signs that the upward trend in exports may be levelling
off. New orders data have been weak for the last several months,
although new foreign orders rose during the first quarter. Also, various
surveys indicate that there'has been no substantial improvement in con-
sumer or business attitudes, which suggests that a surge in investment
spending is unlikely. The rate of capacity utilization has remained at
about 82 per cent, compared with an optimal rate of about 92 per cent.

-18 -
The German authorities remain concerned about the rise in
prices and want to lower the rate further. Consumer prices in April
were 3.8 per cent higher than in April 1976. Recent wage increases of
about 7 per cent, have been somewhat higher than the Government would
like. The average rate of unemployment during 1977 is expected to be
about 4.5 per cent, or only slightly lower than last year.
The main policy initiative in recent months has consisted of
the Medium-Term Infrastructure Program calling for DM 16 billion ($6.7
billion) in public works expenditures. The program, which is likely to
be passed by the Bundestag this month, is to be spread over several
years and is not expected to have much of an impact on the rate of real
GNP growth in 1977.
In France, industrial production has moved erractically since
last autumn, with no clear trend. French real GDP is estimated to have
increased by 5 per cent in 1976, and forecasts indicate a growth of 3
to 4 per cent for 1977.
Although wage increases have decelerated, price increases have
again accelerated with the ending of the government's price freeze in
January and increases in public sector prices in April. The rate of
unemployment has continued to rise moderately.
Government policies remain moderately restrictive within the
framework of the stabilization program announced last October, but some
modest measures to stimulate employment and investment were announced in
April. These measures include some additional state loans to enterprises,
and a FF 3.3 billion ($667 million) increase in government expenditures
in the next twelve months to assist families and the aged, to aid the
employment of youth, and to subsidize the return of unemployed foreign
workers in France to their own countries.

Economic activity in the United Kingdom has been sluggish, but
with some evidence recently of a mild upturn. Real GDP increased 1.1
per cent last year in contrast to a 2.1 per cent decline in 1975.
Fourth quarter real GDP increased at an annual rate of 4 per cent,.but
is expected to increase at a'rate of only about 2 per cent this year,
with most of the growth coming from exports and manufacturing investment.
Fixed investment in manufacturing increased at an annual rate of 6.7
per cent in the fourth quarter, and the volume of exports, after increas-
ing at an annual rate of 20 per cent in the fourth quarter, fell slightly
in the first quarter of 1977. As real average earnings declined, the
volume of retail sales leveled out in July-November and then declined
through March. The tax cuts contained in the March budget are expected
to add only moderately (about a half percentage point) to real GDP
growth this year. Additional tax cuts may be announced later this year,
but the United Kingdom is restrained by the conditions agreed upon with
the IMF as to the size of the public sector deficit, so little addition-
at stimulus can be expected.
The level of economic activity in Italy was unexpectedly
strong in the fourth quarter of last year as a result mainly of a.rise
in consumption and investment. This produced a rise in real GDP of
5.6 per cent for the year as a whole over 1975. Total employment also
increased about one per cent last year over the previous year. During
the first two months of this year, however, output has been roughly
stable, with industrial production remaining at about the same high
level as last December.

-20 -
A low growth rate is anticipated this year as Italy implements
the various policy measures adopted in connection with the April IMF
stand-by arrangement. Specific actions taken so far include a one-year
extension of the ceilings on bank credit to March 1978 and an agreement
between the Government and the labor unions to ease the pressure of
wages on prices. In a move to reduce the large public sector deficit,
Italy has also raised both indirect taxes and public utility charges,
and has increased other government revenues, the total increase being
equivalent to 3-1/2 per cent of GDP.
The Canadian economy is not yet showing signs of a sustained
recovery, although industrial production advanced at an annual rate of
over 9 per cent in the three months through February. Real GNP rose
4.6 per cent in 1976 over the previous year, reflecting primarily
increases in private and public consumption. The investment sector
remains weak and the Finance Minister is forecasting only a 4.0 per
cent increase in real GNP this year.
Although Canadian consumer prices rose less rapidly in 1976
than in the previous year, they accelerated during the first quarter of
this year. In April the unemployment rate increased to a record high
of 8.3 per cent. The federal government's budget, announced at the end
of March, calls for a reduction in the tax burden in order to stimulate
investment and a moderate increase in government expenditures, which
is partly aimed at reducing unemployment in the economically-depressed
regions.

Economic activity in Japan has slowed substantially since the
secod quarter of last year, with industrial production in the first
quarter of this year being only 3.5 per cent above the level in the
second quarter of 1976. Real GNP growth also slowed in the second half
of 1976, although the year-to-year gain in 1976 was 6.3 per cent.
Most of the strength in GNP growth has been in exports and
government expenditures. Fourth quarter export volume was 11-1/2 per
cent higher than during the same period a year earlier. Real fixed
investment declined during the last half of 1976 and is expected to
remain sluggish this year. This mainly reflects the continuing large
amount of excess capacity in the economy, as well as the lackluster
outlook for consumption expenditures. The current round of spring wage
negotiations is resulting in a roughly 9 per cent increase in wages,
which is about the same as the increase in consumer prices in the past
year and last year's wage increase. The number of employed has
increased slightly in the past year.
Major policy actions since late last year have included
three fiscal packages aimed primarily at accelerating residental
housing construction and public works expenditures. Monetary policy
has also been eased, with the Bank of Japan's discount rate being
lowered on March 12 from 6.5 to 6.0 per cent, and again on April 19
to 5.0 per cent. The authorities hope that lowering of the level of
interest rates will stimulate business borrowing and fixed investment.
This year's central government budget, which calls for a 21 per cent
increase in expenditures over the previous fiscal year, contains a cut

-22 -
in personal income taxes of about $2 billion. The Government has stated
its intention to take further stimulative measures, if necessary, in
order to achieve its goal of a 6.7 per cent increase in real GNP in
the fiscal year ending March 1978.

APPENDIX A
A Summary of Recent Fiscal Legislation*
Since the last Greenbook, Congress has approved a number of
the fiscal proposals that were advanced by President Carter in late
January.
A. The House and the Senate have passed THE TAX REDUCTION AND
SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 1977, and thereby have agreed to tax cuts totalling
$2.6 billion in fiscal 1977 and $17.8 billion in fiscal 1978.
Business Tax Reductions -- The Act rejects President
Carter's original recommendation that businesses be allowed to take
an income tax credit equal to 4 per cent of social security taxes
paid or an additional 2 per cent investment tax credit (12 per cent
rather than 10 per cent). Instead Congress approved a tax provision
that permits firms to take an employment tax credit equal to 50 per
cent of the first $4,200 paid to new workers in 1977 and 1978. Employers
are only allowed a maximum $100,000 in credits per year, representing
some 47 new workers. Moreover, the bill allows the credit in 1977 only
if the employer's 1977 unemployment insurance wages are 3 per cent (or
more) above the level reported in the previous year (1976). To the
extent the wages are covered by the credit, they cannot be reported as
costs for income tax purposes. This limitation lowers the effective
employment credit to between $630 and $1,806 per employee depending on
the employer's tax bracket.
Personal Tax Cuts -- The Act raises the standard deduction
for most taxpayers (47 million) by setting a flat $2,200 deduction for
single persons and $3,200 for couples filing a joint return. The previous
deductions ranged from $1,700 to $2,400 for single individuals, and
$2,100 to $2,800 for couples. As these figures indicate, a few single
individuals will pay more taxes than before. This cut in personal taxes
totals around $5-1/2 billion per year and is retroactive to January 1,
1977. Withholding rates, however, will not be adjusted to capture the
full year's tax cut in the forthcoming June through December period in
order to avoid increasing withholding rates on January 1, 1978. Refunds,
therefore, are expected to be somewhat higher in early 1978.
Extension of the 1976 Tax Cuts -- The legislation extends
through 1978 the corporate and personal tax reductions first enacted in
1975 and scheduled to expire at the end of this year. These include
the $35 per person general tax credit, the 10 per cent earned income
credit for families with dependent children, and lower tax rates on the
first $50,000 of corporate taxable income.

Miscellaneous -- The bill also made some modifications
to the recent Tax Reform Act by restoring the deduction for intangible
drilling expenses incurred by independent oil and gas producers;
restoring for 1976 the sick pay exclusion for workers; granting one
year's relief from the tighter tax treatment imposed on employees of
U.S. companies working abroad; and allowing taxpayers 65 years and older
to choose -for one year -between the retirement income credit as it
existed before and after "1976 Tax Reform Act."
B. The Congress by means of the ECONOMIC STIMULUS APPROPRIATIONS
ACT OF 1977 has agreed to fund most of President Carter's original spending
requests. An interesting feature of this bill was the full funding of
the public works and jobs programs in order to eliminate any uncertainty
-- on the part of states and localities -regarding future Federal
spending.
The Public Service Employment Program -- Both the House
and the Senate agreed to the Administration's proposal to increase the
number of Federally-funded jobs under the Comprehensive Employment
Training Act (CETA) from 310,000 now to 600,000 by the end of the current
fiscal year and to 725,000 by the first quarter of fiscal year 1978.
The appropriation bill fully funds the program for fiscal years 1977
and 1978, and this action was designed to insure success in meeting
the specified employment targets.
The Local Public Works Program -- The Congress voted to
extend and expand by $4 billion a local public works' grant program
that was initiated late last year for the purpose of creating construction
jobs in areas of high unemployment. The Carter Administration's original
budget request was for $2 billion in both fiscal 1977 and fiscal 1978.
The full funding of this program should accelerate the flow of Federal
grants to State and local governments for public works construction.
Employment and Training -- The appropriation bill also
provides $1.4 billion for a "Rural Youth Service Corps" modelled after
the Job Corps, a "Skill Training Program" designed to aid permanently
displaced workers, and a "Retraining Program" aimed at providing jobs
for Vietnam-era veterans.
Countercyclical Revenue Sharing -- The Congress funded,
for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 1977, the antirecession
financial assistance program for State and local governments. This
appropriation totals $632 million and triggers whenever the national
unemployment rate exceeds 6 per cent in a given quarter.

A-3
Enactment of the Tax Reduction and Simplication Act of
1977 and the "Economic Stimulus" bill therefore complete Congressional
action on the major items (excluding the rebate) contained in the
original Carter fiscal package.
