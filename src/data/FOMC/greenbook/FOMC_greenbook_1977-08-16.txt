through a comprehensive digitization proce ss which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned 
versions text-searchable.2   Though a stringent quality assurance process was 
employed, some imperfections may remain.

format.  All scanned images were deskewed (to rem ove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced 
tilting) and lightly cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other 
blemishes caused after initial printing).

II -1
DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity continued to expand last month. Payroll
employment increased significantly and retail sales apparently rose
after 3 months of little change. Moreover, industrial production
appears to have risen further in July. The latest indications of
business spending suggest ongoing growth in plant and equipment out-
lays and a moderation of inventory accumulation. Consumer prices
continued to increase rapidly in June, while farm product and food
prices at wholesale fell further.
Industrial production is tentatively estimated to have risen
close to 0.7 per cent in July, about the same as in June. Sizable
advances in consumer durables and business equipment led the July
increase, while a reduction in steel output held down the rise in
materials. Auto assemblies in July rose slightly from June. The 1978
model change-over began this month and production schedules will be
reduced more than usual, reflecting a larger-than-normal retooling
effort by General Motors. Automakers will not be hindered by tighter
emission control standards on 1978 models since amendments to the Clean
Air Act continues the 1977 standards for the next 2 model years.
Reflecting the continued advance in industrial activity,
hiring was brisk at nonfarm establishments in July. After adjusting
for strike activity--largely in Eastern coal mines--nonfarm payroll
employment expanded 300,000, somewhat more than the average monthly

gain over the past year. Manufacturing employment also registered a
good gain, rising 70,000; increases continued in the machinery industry,
and there were sizable additions to jobs at apparel and textile plants.
However, the factory workweek dropped 0.2 hour to 40.3 hours in July,
with large reductions in primary metals and transportation equipment
and smaller changes elsewhere.
The unemployment rate returned in July to the May level of
6.9 per cent. Total employment, as measured by the household survey,
edged down for the first time since last October with almost the entire
decline in agricultural jobs. This drop in total employment follows
a blistering second quarter increase of 1.4 million. Declines in
unemployment were concentrated among adult women and teenagers and
were reflected in a lower jobless rate for part-time workers, among
whom unemployment rose the previous month. Unemployment rates for
more experienced groups were again practically unchanged.
Reflecting strong growth of employment, personal income
advanced briskly during the first half of 1977. Gains in wage and salary
disbursements slowed in June, but the second quarter rate of increase
was the fastest since early 1976. Employment and earnings data
suggest that wages and salaries rose moderately further last month,
and the cost-of-living increase for Social Security recipients, which
was initially paid in July, bolstered income growth.

Supported in part by the rapid growth of personal income,
consumer spending has provided the major impetus to the economic
expansion. Consumer expenditures have generally grown more rapidly
than disposable income since the recession low, and the savings rate
has dropped sharply. The decline in the savings rate and the large
increases in consumer installment debt beginning late last year have
raised questions about the prospective strength of consumer demand.
The strong growth in consumer outlays after early 1975
was accompanied by a steady improvement in household financial posi-
tions (financial assets less liabilities), as chart 1 indicates.
Recently, however, there has been some weakening in household financial
positions. In the first quarter of 1977, liabilities advanced steadily,
but the real value of financial asset holdings declined. Recent
developments in the stock market and the high rate of installment
debt accumulation suggest further weakening. Accordingly, in the
second quarter financial positions are likely to be less supportive
of growth in consumer spending than they were during the first two
years of the recovery. In July, the Conference Board consumer survey
indicated that consumer confidence continued at a high level.
Retail sales apparently registered the first monthly advance
since March. Based on weekly data, retail sales, excluding autos and
mainly nonconsumer items, are estimated to have increased 1 per cent
in July. Expenditures for such discretionary items as general mer-

chandise, apparel, as well as furniture and appliances (GAF) rose
vigorously, and spending at gas stations also was up strongly. On
the other hand, sales at food stores declined.
Unit auto sales eased last month following the rapid second
quarter pace. Total sales in July were at a 10.8 million unit annual
rate, with domestic units at an 8.7 million unit rate--off from the 9.6
million unit rate of the previous month and the 9.3 million selling
pace of the first half. Foreign models sold at a 2.1 million unit
rate in July, off slightly from June and well below the record second
quarter pace.
The book value of manufacturing inventories rose at a $10-1/2
billion annual rate in June--about half the average pace of the pre-
vious two months. With increased shipments and some manufacturers
of nondurable goods cutting back production and employment in June,
there was a slight liquidation of nondurable inventories ($1.0 billion,
annual rate). For the second quarter as a whole, however, the rate
of increase in these stocks was $6.8 billion--up from $3.3 billion in
the first quarter and no change in the fourth. Durable goods pro-
ducers added to stocks in June at about the same $11-1/2 billion pace
as in May; for the quarter durable inventories were up $9.7 billion--
up a bit from the first quarter rise. The inventory-sales ratio for
all manufacturing edged down to 1.56 in June--remaining at an historically
low level. The book value of wholesale trade inventories rose at a

$2.3 billion annual rate in June, about the same as in May. Stocks
of nondurable goods were reduced at a $4 billion annual rate, the
second month of decline following earlier large advances. Stocks
of durable goods held by wholesalers were again accumulated at a
relatively high rate.
Business spending on plant and equipment rose sharply over
the year ending in the second quarter. The second quarter rise in
producers durable equipment was generalized among machinery components
rather than being concentrated in motor vehicles as it was in the
first quarter. There was a strong increase in expenditures on commercial
and industrial buildings in the second quarter, a very weak component
of capital spending over the past several years. However, much of
the second quarter construction increase probably represents a re-
covery.following the weather-depressed first quarter.
Commitments for fixed investment, as measured by contracts
and orders for plant and equipment, declined somewhat in June but for
the quarter advanced 13 per cent in nominal terms. Due to a sub-
stantial bulge in power plant contracts, which are classified among
nonbuilding activity, total commitments for the quarter showed more
strength than either buildings contracts or new orders. Contracts for
commercial and manufacturing buildings--measured by floor space--edged
off in June after a sharp rise in May. New orders for nondefense
capital goods advanced 4.9 per cent in June and 4.5 per cent for the

second quarter as a whole, close to the 5-1/4 per cent average
quarterly increase recorded since the beginning of 1976. Underlying
the strong June increase was a 1-1/2 per cent increase in machinery
orders and a 15 per cent rise in the volatile nonvehicular trans-
portation and communication equipment component.
Possibly presaging additional growth of investment outlays,
capacity utilization in manufacturing has been edging up steadily
since dipping during late 1976. The manufacturing utilization rate
is estimated at [83.7] per cent in July, slightly above the 1955-75
average and within the range where manufacturers historically have
expanded their facilities.
Total private housing starts edged down 6 per cent in June
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.33 million units. Starts
have continued on a high plateau since late last year. In the
second quarter, single-family starts, at 1.42 million units, were
the highest since the series began in 1959. Multifamily starts
gained 5 per cent in the quarter reaching a 468,000 unit rate but
still less than half the pace during the fourth quarter of 1972 when
starts of subsidized units brought a surge in total multifamily units.
During the second quarter, government spending accelerated
significantly. On an NIA basis, Federal spending in the second
quarter rose nearly $10 billion at an annual rate, reflecting an
unusually large increase in defense shipments, higher Commodity
Credit Corporation outlays, and a rise in Federal grants. Initiation

and expansion of a number of public works and job-related grant
programs began to be reflected in State end local government spending
late in the second quarter. The June value of State and local con-
struction put-in-place increased $0.8 billion (2-1/2 per cent) from
an upward revised May level. The June increase brings the series
back to mid-1976 levels, although it is still more than $3 billion
short of the 1975 peak. In addition, State and local government
employment showed a 41,000 increase in July, and gains have totaled
191,000 since April. The Labor Department has indicated that
Federally-subsidized public service employment has been increasing
at a rate of 10,000 workers per week since mid-June. These initial
gains suggest that the Administration likely will make substantial
progress toward its target of raising the current level of public
service jobs from about 320,000 to 600,000 by the end of September.
Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices increased
by an average of 0.6 per cent per month during the three months
ending in June--below the high first-quarter pace but above the
average for 1976 and 1975. Food prices continued to rise at a
rapid rate in June but a sharp decline in wholesale prices of farm
products and foods provides room for moderation in the near term.
The rise for nonfood commodities at retail slowed in June to 0.2 per
cent, as prices declined for gasoline and used cars; the latter
following an exceptionally large advance in the first-quarter.
Prices of apparel and other nondurables, however, rose more in

June than in other recent months. The rise in the services component
continued rapid as it has all year, with large increases for
electricity, water and sewerage, home maintenance and repair as well as
intercity bus and railroad fares.
[The results of the July wholesale price survey will be reported in
the Greenbook supplement.]
Cost pressures on prices continued to be substantial
during the first half of 1977, as labor compensation increases were
significantly above productivity gains. Unit labor costs averaged
about 7 per cent (annual rate) in the nonfarm business sector during
the first two quarters of 1977, up from just under 6 per cent during
1976. The acceleration in unit labor costs has been largely the result
of a slowing of productivity gains from cyclically high 1976 rates.
The unusually rapid growth in employment in recent months, along
with the rebound of the workweek from the weather-depressed first
quarter average, was reflected in a small drop in productivity growth
in the second quarter. However, over the first half of 1977, output
per hour in the nonfarm business sector grew at a 2.3 per cent annual
rate--about in line with the postwar trend.
The average hourly earnings index rose at a 6-1/2 per cent
annual rate in July; close to the average rise over the last 18
months. By contrast, hourly compensation in the nonfarm business
sector rose at more than a 9-1/2 per cent annual rate during the
first two quarters of 1977--up somewhat from the rate during 1976.

First half increases include the effects of higher employer taxes
and the final round of minimum wage adjustments from the 1974
legislation. First-year wage-rate adjustments in major collective
bargaining agreements settled during the first six months of 1977
averaged 8 per cent--down moderately from last year's 8.4 per cent
average. First-year wage and benefit settlements (in agreements
covering 5,000 or more workers) rose faster than average wages alone

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Credit demands by domestic nonfinancial sectors have shown
a mixed pattern in recent weeks. Borrowing by businesses and by
State and local governments has declined. On the other hand,
borrowing by the U.S. Treasury has picked up, and households have
apparently continued to raise large amounts of funds in both the
consumer credit and home mortgage markets.
Growth of the monetary aggregates accelerated sharply in
July. M1 expanded at more than double the substantial second quarter
rate and, with a strengthening of time and savings deposits, M2 and
M3 also surged. Since late July, as the strength in the aggregates
has become apparent to market participants and as the Federal funds
rate has moved up to around 5-3/4 per cent from 5-3/8 per cent,
market interest rates particularly on short- and intermediate-term
issues have come under significant upward pressure. On balance,
rates on these issues have increased about 20 to 35 basis points
since the July FOMC meeting. Yields on Treasury bonds have increased
by about 5 to 10 basis points over this period, while those on
corporate and municipal bonds changed little.1/ Thus, the shift
toward a flatter yield curve that began earlier this year has
continued. Stock price indexes have declined somewhat in the
intermeeting period.
1/ Corporate and municipal yields shown in the table are as of late
last week and, thus, do not reflect more recent market develop-
ments.

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Growth of M1 accelerated to an 18.3 per cent annual rate in
July, following increases of 4.5 per cent in June and 8.4 per cent
for the second quarter. Some special factors contributed to the
surge in July, such as early delivery of Social Security checks,
disrupted check clearings resulting from the New York power failure,
and abnormally large deposits of foreign commercial banks in mid-
month. However, these transitory influences probably accounted for
no more than 4 or 5 percentage points of last month's vigorous
growth, so that the underlying demand for money apparently was quite
strong.
The annual rate of M2 expansion in July of 16.6 per cent
was twice that of June and well above the average second quarter
pace. Growth of commercial bank savings deposits advanced, following
a decline in June, and time deposits (excluding large negotiable CD's)
continued to expand in July at the previous month's rapid pace.
Deposit flows to thrift institutions, particularly S&L's, also
increased sharply during the month, and M3 expanded at a 16 per cent
annual rate.
After contracting in June, savings deposits at commercial
banks (line 6 of table) expanded modestly in July; the June-July
average growth rate was just under 3 per cent. The expansion of
total savings deposits at banks seemed to be tempered by a decline
in savings deposits of businesses and State and local governments

time deposit growth at S&L's has approached 20 per cent in recent
months, compared with sluggish passbook account growth generally
below 5 per cent, although July figures are not yet available.
The spreads between time deposit rate ceilings and comparable
security yields have been quite sizable, while most short-term
market rates have risen close to or above savings deposit rate
ceilings at commercial banks and thrifts. The strength in time
deposits also may have resulted in part from more vigorous promotion
of longer-term deposits by financial institutions and from increases
in offering rates to levels at or near regulatory ceilings in order
to attract and hold funds from maturing "wild-card" deposits.
With total deposit flows stronger, banks reduced their
dependence on large negotiable CD's (line 17) in July, following a
temporary second quarter upturn. A few large banks had issued an
appreciable volume of CD's during June for window-dressing purposes,
and subsequently allowed such deposits to decline. Nondeposit

been expanding counter to the downtrend in large CD's since mid-1975,
were unchanged in July.1/
Commercial bank credit expanded at an annual rate of 9-1/4
per cent in July, slightly above the June pace. The largest rate of
decline in holdings of Treasury securities since October 1974 was
only partly offset by an increase in holdings of other securities.
But total bank loans grew at the fastest rate of the year. Real
estate loans apparently continued to expand almost as strongly as in
June, while business loan growth, at 8 per cent, was well below its
June rate.
Business Credit
The slowing of business loan growth at banks was concentrated
at large banks, primarily in loans to manufacturing firms and public
utilities. An informal Reserve Bank survey of large money center
banks indicated that such banks are making a greater proportion of
their business loans to small and medium-sized firms, while demand for
bank loans by large firms remains soft. Nevertheless, the bankers
contacted reported an unwillingness to lower the prime rate relative
to their cost of funds, partly due to reductions in earnings that would
result on existing floating rate loans. It was also reported that
intensifying competition for loans to smaller firms is being reflected
in a narrowing of spreads for non-prime borrowers between actual
lending rates and the prime rate. In addition, more firms are

qualifying for prime rate status, and fixed rate loans are becoming
more widely available. Some of the bankers also said that compensating
balances are being less rigidly enforced. The February and May
Surveys of Terms of Bank Lending, which show declines in rates on
intermediate-size short-term business loans, tend to substantiate the
finding of increased competitiveness for small business loans.
Meanwhile, outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial
businesses contracted in July (memo item 1 in table), as some large
issuers reportedly replaced maturing commercial paper with longer-
term debt.1/ Taken together, business loans at banks and non-
financial commercial paper (memo item 2) expanded at a 6-1/2 per cent
rate in July, following a gain of 15 per cent in the second quarter
and of 17-3/4 per cent in June. Business loans at finance companies,
which had grown at more than a 20 per cent annual rate during the
first half, also may have slowed somewhat in July, according to
limited company reports.
Gross issues of publicly offered corporate bonds totaled
$2.4 billion in July, above the $1.9 billion monthly average
recorded in the second quarter and the $2.3 billion offered in June.
July's slate of offerings was bolstered by the largest volume of
industrial issues since last December; utility offerings, however,
were below their advanced second quarter pace.
1/ The substitution of longer-term debt for commercial paper also
characterized the much larger financial issuer component of the
non-bank commercial paper market. The major auto finance companies,
for example, substantially reduced their commercial paper out-
standing.

III -9
Prime-rated (Aaa and Aa) publicly offered bond issues
accounted for almost two-thirds of July's offerings, extending the
pattern that has characterized public bond offerings in 1977. Major
underwriters report that many lower-rated corporations are continuing
to place their debt in the private market, where interest rate
relationships remain favorable and major investors (primarily life
insurance companies) continue to have an abundance of available funds.
Despite the substantial volume of corporate bonds placed, yields have
changed little since the last FOMC meeting.
Stock prices have moved generally lower since the last
FOMC meeting, despite the apparent improvement in overall corporate
profits during the second quarter. Concern over possible slowing of
economic expansion, the large U.S. trade deficit, and the outlook for
interest rates were cited by market professionals as contributing to
the weakness in equity prices.
The erosion in stock prices since year-end 1976 has been
most pronounced for a relatively small number of highly capitalized
industrial companies listed on the N.Y.S.E.--firms whose share price
movements tend to dominate the most widely followed stock price
indexes.1/ Many of these "growth" stocks had shown above average

years. Although some of these companies have suffered interruptions
in their per share earnings growth or other set-backs in recent
months, it also appears that investors have been reevaluating the
longer-term prospects for such businesses. In addition, market
professionals have indicated that dividend yields have become a more
important measure of financial strength in recent months.
Treasury and Municipal Securities Markets
The Treasury has borrowed more actively in recent weeks,
raising about $1.5 billion of new money through the sale of 2-year
notes, and another $3.0 billion in new money through sales of 3- and
7-year notes and 29-1/2 year bonds in connection with the mid-August
refunding.1/ The immediate interest rate impact of the Treasury's
activities was minimized by the fact that they had been well-
anticipated and dealers had taken large short positions in coupon
issues in preparation for the refunding (and possibly in expectation
of a Federal funds rate increase). No further paydown of Treasury
bills has taken place since the July FOMC meeting, following the $9
billion runoff in the second quarter and $800 million runoff in early
July.
Since the last FOMC meeting, yields on Treasury bills have
increased by about 30 to 35 basis points while coupon yields are up
by around 5 to 25 basis points. These advances took place in the

the new issues to foreign official accounts bidding noncompetively.

wake of the upward movement in the Federal funds rate and the release
of information about the acceleration of the monetary aggregates.
Gross offerings of long-term State and local government
debt fell to approximately $3.1 billion in July--a greater than
seasonal decline from the $5.7 billion June figure, and the $4.0
billion monthly average in the first half of 1977. Municipalities
apparently concentrated their offerings in the first half of this
year in anticipation of higher rates later in the year. Advance
refunding issues accounted for a somewhat smaller share of the
municipal volume than in the preceding several months.
The heavy volume of State and local debt offerings in the
last several quarters does not imply a commensurate increase in State
and local expenditures as recorded in the NIA accounts. Indeed,
besides advance refunding of outstanding debt, State and local
governments apparently have been using a significant portion of their
bond proceeds for relending or for acquiring facilities constructed
by the private sector.1/ An examination of prospectuses and other
information representing about 68 per cent of April's gross offering
1/ State agencies may issue long-term bonds at tax-exempt rates and
then lend the money to the private sector to finance construction
or make mortgage loans for low- and moderate-income housing at
rates below those available from conventional sources. Hospital
financing and loan programs aiding veterans are similar examples
of State and local financing not directly related to State and
local capital spending. Port facilities constructed by oil
companies in Valdez, Alaska have been financed in the tax-exempt
market and private companies also continue to take advantage of
tax-exempt bond financing for pollution control.

volume shows that nearly two-thirds was for purposes that do not show
up as NIA State and local expenditures.
Mortgage and Consumer Loans
Growth in mortgage debt outstanding apparently picked up
somewhat further during July from the record rate estimated for the
second quarter. Mortgage loans at commercial banks increased about
$2 billion--somewhat below the June figure but about equal to the
monthly average for the second quarter. Moreover, new issues of
GNMA-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities increased in July to $1.4
billion, some 10 per cent higher than the average for the first six
months of the year. At savings and loan associations, which have
accounted for about half of total mortgage debt formation in recent
periods, record commitments in June and strong deposit flows in July
suggest that net mortgage lending by the S&L's may have increased
further from the record June pace. Mutual savings banks also have
begun to channel more funds into residential mortgages after a long
lag, and life insurance company investments in large income property
mortgages--primarily commercial--have been picking up.
Average interest rates on new commitments for conventional
home loans at S&L's have changed little since the last FOMC meeting,
and remain about 30 basis points above their cyclical low in March.
However, reflecting developments in the bond markets since late
July, yields on GNMA-guaranteed securities have backed up by about
10 basis points. Moreover, the volume of bidding in the early August

FNMA auction of forward commitments to purchase FHA/VA home mortgages
increased substantially--due in part to the deterioration of GNMA
prices--and average yields on accepted bids rose by 4 basis points.
The speculative home buying that was reported in some
parts of California during the early months of this year has
apparently moderated. Citing improvements in data on regional
mortgage activity since April, the Federal Home Loan Bank of
San Francisco lowered the rates charged on advances to member
associations by 25 basis points, effective July 25. These rates had
been raised by a full percentage point in late April in an attempt to
discourage lending for speculative purposes. Both loan closings and
mortgage commitments outstanding at S&L's in the San Francisco
district declined, seasonally adjusted, in May and June.
Consumer instalment credit outstanding, based on newly
revised series, expanded at a $27 billion or 14 per cent annual rate
in June, off somewhat from the preceding two months. A pickup in
repayments, responding to earlier strength in extension, tended to
retard the growth of credit outstanding. Nevertheless, the second
quarter 16 per cent annual growth rate was among the strongest
quarterly expansions since the mid-1950's, when the outstanding credit
base was much smaller. With continued strong new-car sales in July
and firmness in other consumer durable goods sales, the June growth
rate in outstandings was probably at least maintained in July.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. The downward pressure on the dollar
which had developed at the end of June was reversed at the end of July,
and over the past three weeks the dollar's average exchange value increased
by 1 per cent, recovering about half of its decline of the previous month.
The recent recovery of the dollar was triggered in the last week
of July by statements of U.S. officials emphasizing the importance of a
strong dollar, and by a firming of short-term U.S. interest rates. The
subsequent rise of the dollar has been greatest against the European snake
currencies, the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen. Against the mark, the
dollar has appreciated by over 3 per cent, following a decline against
the mark of nearly 5 per cent the previous month. Earlier in July, when
the dollar was under downward pressure against the mark, the System made
intervention sales of marks totaling $80 million equivalent, financed in
part by swap drawings on the Bundesbank of $35 million equivalent. The
System repaid these swap drawings in full on August 8, using marks purchased
in the New York market as the dollar moved back up.
Within the European joint float, the Swedish krona and, to a
lesser extent, the Danish and Norwegian currencies have continued to
experience periods of intense downward pressure.

IV -2
The Canadian dollar came under selling pressure late in July,
and has since fallen against the U.S. dollar by 1-1/2 per cent to its
lowest level since 1969. This latest downward pressure on the Canadian
currency was sparked by rising U.S. interest rates and Finance Minister
Macdonald's admission that the Government's target of a 6 per cent
inflation rate in the second year of the controls program will not be
achieved.
July 27, the Bank of England announced that it would allow
sterling to rise above its previous de facto ceiling of $1.72. The
pound immediately appreciated by over 1 per cent against the dollar, then
stabilized slightly below $1.74, where it has remained so far this month
On August 5, the Bank of England reduced its Minimum Lending Rate by 1/2
percentage point to 7-1/2 per cent -- one-half the peak 15 per cent level
of last Fall and the lowest level for the MLR since 1973.

IV -3
International capital markets. Total borrowing in the Euro-
credit, Euro-bond, and foreign bond markets in the second quarter was
somewhat below the first-quarter level. The approximately $30 billion
of such borrowing in the first half of 1977, while very high by pre-1976
standards, was 4 per cent below the second half of last year. A con-
siderable decrease in Euro-credits in the second quarter was only
partially offset by a further rise in Euro-bond issues and an upturn in
foreign bond issues.
Medium-term Euro-currency bank credits of $6.0 billion arranged
in the second quarter were down 25 per cent from the first, as borrowers
in developed countries borrowed less and oil-exporting countries were
almost wholly absent from the market. Reduced borrowings by these two
groups essentially reflected the fact that the governments of the United
Kingdom, Sweden, and Venezuela, which had borrowed large amounts ($3.7
billion in all) in the first quarter, did not tap the market in the
ensuing months. French borrowings have continued to run well above last
year's rate and totaled $750 million in the second quarter, of which
$600 million was borrowed by Electricite de France for eight years to
backstop U.S. commercial paper issues. Denmark, continuing to run large
external deficits, arranged a $500 million 7-year Euro-loan in June,
bringing Danish Government Euro-credits to $0.7 billion in the first six
months of this year.
Non-oil developing countries contracted substantially more
Euro-credits in the second quarter than in the first. The rise reflected

IV -4
three new credits totaling over $1 billion to Brazilian borrowers, the
largest being to the Government oil company and the new Brazilian
steel company Acominas. However, total first-half borrowings by non-oil
LDC's were considerably below last year's second-half and about equal
to the first-half 1976 rate. Credits to the centrally-planned
(Communist) economies continued to run well below 1976 rates.
Euro-bond issues were at new record levels in the second
quarter, and the nearly $10 billion total for the first half of 1977 was
almost one-third above last year's average half-yearly rate. Canadian
and French issues have continued below the levels of the first half of
last year. On the other hand, increased amounts have been raised on the
market this year, especially in the second quarter, by borrowers in a
number of European countries and the United States. The market has been
more receptive to British issues this year because of Britain's improved
external finances and the governments of Sweden and Denmark have turned
to the bond market as an additional source of funds to meet payments
imbalances. In addition, banks in many European countries have par-
ticipated in the growing number of issues by commercial banks of medium-
term notes, frequently carrying variable interest rates, to improve their
capital position. Euro-bond issues by developing countries rose again
in the second quarter and, while still a small part of total issues,
have contributed to the growth of issue activity this year.

IV -5
The second quarter saw a sharp rebound in foreign bond issues
as flotations by the IBRD and by other non-Canadian borrowers picked up.
This was reflected in increased foreign issues in the United States.
However, the $6.3 billion first-half total of foreign issues still
trailed last year's issue rates (notably the first half) by a wide
margin. The IBRD has been borrowing less this year than last, and,
apart from the Quebec political situation, Canadian foreign borrowing
has reflected reduced needs for new long-term funds by some Canadian
entities and relatively heavier use of the domestic capital market for
interest rate or other reasons.

U.S. International Transactions in the Second Quarter. The
merchandise trade deficit for 1977-Q2 widened to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $31 billion as an increase in exports (about $4 billion
at an annual rate) was more than offset by a $7 billion annual rate
increase in imports (see summary table below). Private capital flows
for which we have data show a net outflow of about $0.6 billion. OPEC
net investments in the U.S. totalled $0.8 billion for the second quarter,
off sharply from the $2.7 billion inflow during the first quarter. Thus,
most of the net capital inflow which matched our current account deficit,
which we estimate to have been about $5 billion at a quarterly rate, was
from foreign official institutions other than OPEC (see summary table
below). The increase in foreign official claims on the U.S. resulted
from exchange market intervention by several foreign central banks (see
discussion of exchange markets in this greenbook).

U.S. Merchandise Trade. The rise in exports'in the second
quarter was about evenly split between agricultural and nonagricultural
commodities. Agricultural exports rose by 9 per cent in the second
quarter to total $26.7 billion at an annual rate. Most of the increase
was from e higher value of soybean exports as export prices rose 20 per
cent betwZen March and June and quantities also increased. There was
also an increase in the quantity of wheat exported that was not quite
offset by a decline in wheat export prices.
Nearly all of the nonagricultural export increase was in
industrial supplies (particularly coal which is shipped largely to
Japan, and nonferrous metals) and in civilian aircraft exports. The
value of machinery exports was slightly larger in the second quarter than
in the first quarter, primarily because of price rises. The volume of
machinery exports expanded by 1-1/2 per cent.

IV -10
Second quarter imports rose strongly with the pickup in the
U.S. economy; the increase was about evenly split between oil and non-oil.
The rise in non-oil imports was spread over a broad range of commodities
with some of the larger increases coming in industrial supplies. Nearly
all of the 14 per cent rise in industrial supplies was in volume; steel
accounted for about one-third of that rise (mostly from the EEC); another
large part of the increase was nonferrous metals. Foreign car imports
were up slightly in the second quarter but imports, throughout the quarter,
were less than the record sales.
The volume of oil imports increased by 5 per cent to 9.8
million barrels per day in the second quarter while the price rose 3 per
cent to an average $13.37 per barrel. A large part of the increase in
petroleum imports in the second quarter was probably due to stock building
in anticipation of the July 1 OPEC price increase. At the end of June 1977

stocks of crude petroleum and products were about 100 million barrels
greater than was the average for June of the preceding two years. The
estimated $84 million barrel increase in stocks in 1977-Q2 added about
$4.5 billion at an annual rate to second quarter imports. It is unlikely
that this will be permanent increase in the level of private petroleum
stocks.
Foreign participation in selected U.S. credit markets. In the
second quarter, U.S. banking offices reported a net inflow of funds from
foreigners of $2.3 billion, compared to a net outflow of $2.2 billion
in the first quarter (see table below). The shift to an inflow
reflected the restructuring of some foreign portfolios away from the
Treasury securities and towards bank liabilities, rather than the repay-
ment of bank loans by foreigners. The shift into U.S. bank deposits,
notably by the World Bank, probably reflected the rising yield
differential in favor of large negotiable CD's over Treasury bills in the
second quarter.
Foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury Securities by non-OPEC
countries totaled about $4 billion in the second quarter. The United
Kingdom and Italy accounted for about one-half of this total. For many
of these countries investment in Treasury securities is closely related
to exchange market intervention, in this instance to purchases of dollars
against their own currencies. OPEC sold a small net amount of Treasury
securities, as compared to purchases of $2.4 billion in the first quarter,

U.S. and offshore markets. The World Bank also reduced its holdings of
Treasury securities by $1-1/2 billion and placed about $0.5 billion in
the Euro-dollar market.
Private and official foreign purchases of U.S. corporate
securities (stocks and bonds) totalled $1.3 billion in the second quarter,
compared to $1.1 billion in the first quarter, and a quarterly average in
1976 of about $750 million. Of the $1.3 billion of foreign purchases
of U.S. corporate securities in the second quarter, $400 million represents
the purchase in private placements by one OPEC country of medium-term
notes of five major U.S. corporations. Stock purchases by foreigners of
$700 million were slightly above the quarterly average of $675 million in
1976.

New issues of foreign securities in the United States increased

Prices and Price Policies in Foreign Industrial Countries.
Following very sharp rises in wholesale and consumer prices in 1974,
price performance improved notably in most foreign industrial countries
in 1975 and 1976 (see attached Table). Inflation rates remain high,
however, and the degree to which further reductions seem likely varies
greatly among countries. Continued price inflation is generally occuring
in an environment of high unemployment of labor and capital resources
and general weakness of economic activity. Except in Germany and Japan,
consumer price increases in the major countries remained in the 10 to
20 per cent range (n.s.a., annual rates) over the latest three months
available. Recent wholesale price developments also have been sharply
different across countries. Among the smaller industrial countries
Switzerland has experienced almost stable prices during the past year;
inflation rates remain high in most of the others.
The underlying causes of such price performance differ among
countries. One common factor, however, is the experience with food
and other commodity prices. Impetus to food price inflation was pro-
ided by the 1976 drought, which impaired European agricultural output.
Additional upward pressure stemmed from the harshness of the past winter
and from spring freezes -e.g., in France -which damaged fruit and
vegetable crops. Substantial increases in prices of tropical beverages
have also played a well-publicized role.
After peaking in 1974, nonfood commodity prices fell sharply
in 1975, but most turned up again during 1976 and early 1977. In March
of this year new peaks were reached. Since then, spot prices of

commodity have receded, partly due to forecasts of new record harvests
of major feedgrains, and partly because of weak markets for major
metals such as steel and copper.
Individual countries have in the past few years employed a
wide array of strategies for bringing inflation under control. A few,
such as Japan and Germany, have relied mainly on general macroeconomic
policies, but most others have employed direct wage and price controls
(including freezes), "social-contracts" and consensus, tax-package/
wage-bargain tradeoffs and modifications in indexing arrangements to
break the inflationary spiral. How successful these strategies have
been is open to doubt. Other factors rendering the wage/price outlook
somewhat problematic are political instabilities, labor militancy and
problems in winding-down existing wage/price controls.
Price and wage increases in Japan have moderated greatly
since 1974. During the latest three quarters, wholesale prices have
been fairly stable (in July the WPI was only 1.1 per cent higher than
a year earlier), although consumer prices rose at about a 10 per cent
annual rate. in the first half of 1977. Export prices (in yen terms)
have fallen during the past twelve months. Nominal wage gains of manu-
facturing workers in the spring wage-offensive this year came to around
9 per cent, about the same as in 1976.
In general the Japanese rely more on jawboning during the
spring wage-rounds than on formal wage/price controls to influence
events, although prices of certain goods and services, including
utilities, transportation and rice, are subject to explicit controls.

IV -17
The recent, sizeable appreciation of the Japanese yen may have a
dampening influence on further price increases. Despite the first
half performance, the government hopes that the increase in the CPI
during 1977 can be held to 8 per cent.
German price inflation during the past several years has
been the lowest among the major foreign countries. After peaking at
7 per cent in 1974, consumer price increases dropped to 4.6 per cent
in 1976 and are expected to fall further, to around 4 per cent, this
year, although a rise in value-added taxation is scheduled for 1978.
Since the middle of last year,wholesale prices have risen only slightly;
export prices (in DM) have been nearly flat. Further increases are
expected to remain moderate, partly because of the appreciation of the
DM.
Germany has no formal system of wage-price controls. Periodic
consultations among the government, employers and labor -- the so-
called "Concerted Action" -- have usually been successful at finding
some consensus on appropriate adjustments. The most recent round,
however, was boycotted by labor representatives, partly because two
years of wage-restraint and their assent to increased profit margins
for enterprises have not set in train any noticeable reduction in
unemployment.
In Germany one goal of announcing monetary targets has been
to influence wage and price expectations. The Bundesbank has explicitly
cautioned that its projected monetary growth sets out approximate
boundaries on the growth of nominal incomes, and that the bank could

not be expected to validate excessive claims by supplying additional
money.
During 1976 French consumer prices rose by almost 10 per
cent, which represented some improvement from the previous two years.
Wholesale prices, which had decreased in 1975, resumed their upward
rise in 1976.
Since the oil crisis the French government has experimented
with various wage and price controls. These have included efforts to
mandate public sector settlements, use of passthrough rules for price
setting, freezing of profit margins for producers and importers and
controls on the distribution and service sectors. A program to tax
"excess value-added" was passed in 1974, but so far has not been acti-
viated. The Barre program of September 1976 featured a 3-month price
freeze on most items in the consumer price index,except for fresh
foods and some agricultural products whose prices are set by the
European Community. Utility charges were frozen until April of this
year; limits were imposed on rent increases through 1977, and an
absolute ceiling was imposed on the franc value of oil imports. Another
element contributing to the improvement in first quarter price
statistics was a reduction in value-added taxes (from 20 per cent to
17.6 per cent) which took effect at the beginning of the year. In the
second quarter however, consumer prices accelerated again. In view of
the highly uncertain political situation, the ability of the French
government to maintain stringent measures until the elections next
March may be questionable.

Rates of price increase in Italy have been high for several
years. Consumer prices in 1976 rose by 16.7 per cent, only fractionally
less than in 1975, and wholesale price increases substantially exceeded
1975 results. Second quarter 1977 figures show some deceleration in
both indexes, although it would be difficult to conclude that lasting
improvement is yet in sight. The Italian situation has been complicated
by the sharp fall of the lira during 1976 and the general system of
wage-indexing, the scala mobile, under which nominal wages rapidly
adjust almost fully to price increases.
In connection with IMF negotiations, Italian authorities
have tried to modify the scala mobile. Some progress has been
recorded, but this has fallen short of what would seem desirable. To
lower labor costs, the government agreed to assume part of the social
insurance charges formerly paid by business, offsetting the additional
budget costs by increasing the value-added and certain other indirect
taxes. It failed, however, in an effort to sterilize the impact of
these tax increases on the scala mobile. Still, government agreements
with employers and unions on productivity and labor-use may have a
salutary effect on the wage/price situation. While such initiatives
are not a comprehensive price or incomes policy, Italy does exercise
direct control over a limited number of goods' prices. In addition,
in their Letter of Intent to the IMF, the Italians accepted certain
inflation objectives and acknowledge that further changes in the scala
mobile might be required.

In the United Kingdom price inflation during 1976 dropped to
about 16.5 per cent, compared with over 24 per cent during 1975. Both
wholesale and consumer price increases accelerated in the fourth quarter
and continued at higher levels through the middle of 1977. It is
generally felt that the sharp depreciation of the pound sterling last
year accounts for part of this renewed price surge. Likewise, price
prospects may have improved recently in consequence of the pound's
external strength.
The United Kingdom has a long history of wage/price controls
in almost every conceivable form. Under Phase I of the "voluntary"
program, which began in 1975, there was a £6 limitation on increases in
weekly wages for most workers. Phase II, which took effect in August
1976, replaced this lump-sum approach with a 5 per cent limitation on
most wage gains, in exchange for government commitments to cut personal
taxes. The Trades Union Congress has recently rejected any specific
Phase III, which would have begun this month. Further wage restraint
is therefore now in doubt, although there are hopes that the unions
will honor the 12-month contracts made during Phase II before, demanding
further wage increases.
As with wage controls, the United Kingdom has experimented
with several generations of price control measures. Under new legis-
lation replacing the 1973 "Price Code," the Price Commission has been
given power to freeze certain prices for up to three months and to
recommend freezes for up to 12 months, if necessary.

IV -21
The Canadian price situation improved dramatically following
the introduction of the Anti-Inflation Program (AIP) in late 1975.
Wholesale prices in 1976 rose by slightly over 4 per cent, while con-
sumer prices rose by 7.5 per cent. A good part of the improvement,
however, was due to the slowdown in food-price increases, which are not
covered by the AIP. More recently, inflation has accelerated again,
with an upsurge in food prices again a major influence. The recent
depreciation of the Canadian dollar -- by about 9 per cent against
the U.S. dollar -- may be expected to intensify this pressure, in view
of Canada's close trade relations with the United States.
The Canadian AIP, which is scheduled to expire at the end of
1978, provides fairly comprehensive controls on prices, wages and
profits in nonagricultural sectors. Initial target rates of inflation
under this program were 8 per cent for 1976, 6 per cent for 1977 and
4 per cent for 1978; similar wage increases were targeted. An Anti-
Inflation Board has powers to roll back "unjustified" increases and/
or levy fines against offenders. Although the 1976 price objectives
of the AIP were met (and wage increases dropped by half, to about 9
per cent), similarly favorable results for 1977 are in doubt. An
increase in consumer prices of at least 7-1/2 percent is now
expected for the year as a whole.

Appendix A*
REVISION OF NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS1/
Revised National Income and Product Accounts indicate that the
recent recession was not quite as severe as earlier indicated. The re-
covery in economic activity since the trough was of the same magnitude as
previously estimated, although the sluggish growth in the second half of
1976 was more pronounced than suggested by the earlier estimates. Addi-
tionally, the revised estimates indicate that over the last three years
there was less personal saving and more business saving than estimated
earlier.
Gross national product (GNP) in real terms is now estimated to
have declined 1.4 per cent in 1974 and 1.3 per cent in 1975, both some-
what less than indicated earlier, while growth in 1976--6.0 per cent--
was virtually unchanged from prior reports. (See Table I.) The major
revisions were concentrated in the contraction phase of the current cycle.
The revised data indicate a drop of 5.9 per cent from QIV-1973 to QI-1975--
three-quarters of a percentage point less than the earlier estimate; how-
ever, the recession is still indicated to have been the deepest and longest
of the postwar period. The rise from QI-1975 to QI-1977 was about un-
changed at 12.1 per cent, but real growth in the final quarter of 1976--
now estimated at 1.2 per cent annual rate--was almost 1-1/2 percentage points
below the previous indication. In current dollar terms, the level of GNP
was revised downward fractionally in 1974 and upward by $12.5 billion and
$14.9 billion in 1975 and 1976, respectively. Revisions in aggregate GNP
prices, on balance,were quite small and reflected the introduction of more
appropriate price indexes for components of business fixed investment and
for residential investment.
Some of the more significant sectoral changes resulting from this
revision are:
1. Most of the 1975 and 1976 upward revisions to nominal GNP reflected
higher estimates for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) with
two-thirds of the 1976 revision occurring in the services category--
especially "medical" services. The upward revision in PCE re-
duced the saving rate markedly in 1976 from 6.5 per cent to 5.6
per cent and in 1975 from 7.8 per cent to 7.4 per cent.
1/This revision covers the period 1974-I through 1977-I. New source data
which were not available at the time of the earlier estimates are incorporated
and seasonal factors are updated in the annual July revision.

Research and Statistics.

2. Inventory liquidation in 1975 is now indicated to have been much
less than earlier estimated while the accumulation in 1976 is now
indicated as a bit greater.
3. Government, at all levels, purchased $4.3 billion less goods
and services in 1976 than had been thought earlier. Of this
total, $3.3 billion was accounted for by the Federal government.
4. The largest revisions in prices were in residential fixed
investment where a new price index was incorporated and in
nonresidential fixed investment where new lag structures were
applied to reflect more appropriate delivery prices.
5. On the income side, corporate profits, both before and after
inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, were
revised sharply upward in 1975 and 1976. Proprietors' income was
revised downward in both years--with the revision applying to
both the farm and nonfarm components. Government receipts were
revised sharply upward in 1976 while overall expenditures were
scaled down. This resulted in a combined Federal-State and local
deficit of $35.6 billion rather $44.7 billion as estimated earlier.
Consumer Activity
Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) were revised upward by
increasingly large amounts starting in 1974-III, and by 1976-IV the revi-
sion was $17.0 billion. Over this period almost 80 per cent of the total
PCE revision was in the services component with the bulk in medical ser-
vices. Revisions in durable spending were modest except in the final
quarters of each of the three years, when automobile expenditures are
indicated to have increased sizeably more than earlier estimated. Non-
durable spending was revised upward in all of 1976 and the first quarter of
1977--mainly in the food and clothing categories. For the period 1974-III
to 1976-IV only two-fifths of the upward revision in total PCE represented
prices--mainly food in 1974; autos, food and medical services in 1975; and
medical services in 1976.
Consumer spending (in real terms) is now estimated to have de-
clined only 2.3 per cent between its 1973-III peak and 1974-IV trough,
rather than by 2.9 per cent as estimated earlier. From that trough to
1977-I, the rise in real PCE remains virtually unchanged at about 12.9
per cent.
Previous estimates of personal income were revised up by pro-
gressively greater amounts in each of the three years covered in this
revision. (Table II.) Within personal income, relatively large upward
revisions were made in other labor income (mainly employer contributions
to pension and welfare funds) and transfer payments, while there were
downward revisions in wages and salaries and in proprietors' (both farm

A -3
and nonfarm) incomes (including inventory valuation and capital consump-
tion adjustments). In addition, estimates of personal tax and nontax pay-
ments were raised in 1976. On balance, disposable income was revised
upward but by considerably less than consumer outlays in both 1975 and
1976; this resulted in a significant reduction in the saving rate. By
the first quarter of 1977, the saving rate was estimated at 4.1 per cent--
3/4 of a percentage point below the prior indication and the lowest since
the Korean War-affected level of 3.7 per cent in 1951-I.
Business Activity
Business spending on fixed capital goods was revised upward
through the entire revision period reaching a maximum of $3.1 billion
in 1977-1 (current dollars). The bulk of the upward revisions was in
expenditures for producers' durable equipment, although by 1977-I, the
revision was about evenly split between this and the nonresidential
structures component. In real terms, BFI is now estimated to have
fallen by 17.2 per cent between its specific peak (1974-I) and trough
(1975-III)--a slightly smaller drop than earlier indicated. From 1975-III
to 1977-, real BFI rose 12.0 per cent instead of 11.1 as estimated earlier.
(See Table III.)
The revisions in nonfarm business inventory investment (in both
current and constant dollars) indicate somewhat less accumulation in 1974,
less liquidation in 1975 and more accumulation in 1976 than previously
estimated. Nevertheless, the $26 billion (annual rate) liquidation in
the first two quarters of 1975 remains the largest of the postwar period.
Movements in the constant dollar inventories/final sales ratio were little
affected by the revision; the extremely high peak in late 1974 was lowered
just a bit by the revisions from .261 to .259. In 1977-I this ratio was
.236.
Corporate profits were revised upward substantially in both 1975
and 1976. Economic profits (those with IVA and capital consumption ad-
justments) are now indicated as $8 billion and $10 billion higher in 1975
and 1976, respectively, and little changed for 1974. Most of the profits
revisions were in before tax profits as tax liability and the IVA and
the capital consumption adjustment were all little changed by the revi-
sion. And, with little change in the dividend figures, almost all of the
before tax profits revisions were carried through into undistributed pro-
fits. Economic cash flow--as measured by the sum of undistributed pro-
fits plus capital consumption allowances with capital consumption adjust-
ment2/ --shows that internally generated funds available for investment
grew by 50 per cent between 1973 and 1976 on the revised basis rather
than by the earlier indicated 45 per cent. Profit shares, of national

sure of economic replacement.

A 4
income, both before and after taxes, were revised upward and in 1976
were nearly back to their pre-recession levels although still lower
than the levels reported during the 1960's.
Residential Construction Activity
Revisions in the level of spending for residential construc-
tion were fairly small in both current and constant dollar terms. Real
spending is estimated to have been a bit stronger since mid-1975 than
previously. The major revision in this sector was the introduction of
the Census Bureau's new price index for single family homes (based on
specifications for a 1974 home rather than a 1976 home). The main
effect of this new index was to reduce slightly the rate of increase in
new home prices in 1975 and 1976.
Net Exports
The July revision had little effect on net exports in either
current or constant dollar terms. The most sizable revisions were in
1974 when the level of exports was reduced by $6-1/2 billion and imports
by $5 billion.
Government Sector
The revisions indicate that on an NIPA basis net government
spending was substantially less stimulative than the earlier figures had
indicated--especially in 1976. The combined Federal and State and local
deficit was reduced by $9 billion in 1976--from $44.7 billion to $35.6
billion. The Federal deficit was reduced by about $4-1/2 billion while the
surplus of State and local governments was raised by $4-1/2 billion. (See
Table IV.)
Federal defense purchases of goods and services were reduced
in each of the thirteen quarters affected by the revisions; the largest
reductions were in the final quarters of 1976 and totaled $5 billion.
Nondefense purchases were revised down in 11 of the thirteen quarters,
with the reductions averaging just under $2 billion for the final quarter
of 1975 and all of 1976. Total receipts were revised up by $.4 billion
in 1975 and $2.0 billion in 1976. Receipts from business taxes and accruals
were a little larger in 1975 than earlier estimated but considerably less
during the final quarter of 1976; personal tax payments were increased
substantially in the last three quarters of 1976.
State and local government purchases of goods and services
were scaled down over most of the revision period with the largest re-
ductions coming in 1976-HII and 1977-I when employee compensation and
spending on structures were both lowered by a substantial amounts.
Transfer payments by States and localities were generally higher than had
been indicated earlier. Receipts from personal and business taxes were

A -5
considerably increased in 1976 as were grants-in-aid from the Federal
government. These revisions in spending and receipts resulted in the
"operating" surplus3/ for the sector as a whole being revised upward
in 1977-I by about $5-1/2 billion to $11.9 billion--a level exceeded only
in 1972-IV when there was a substantial infusion of Federal revenue
sharing funds.
Prices
The overall impact of the revision on prices, as measured by
the GNP implicit price deflator, was relatively small. The rate of
increase in these prices was revised downward in 1974 by .3 percentage
point but upward by .3 and .2 percentage point in 1975 and 1976,
respectively. Since fixed-weighted measures of aggregate price increases--
both for GNP and gross domestic business product--were revised up in all
three years, only the revision in 1974 could be attributed to a changing
mix of GNP. In addition to introducing a more appropriate price index
for residential construction, a new lag structure was developed for de-
flating producers' durable equipment by delivery prices rather than the
reported orders price indexes.
Revisions in the quarterly pattern of price increases were
generally small and do not significantly alter the pattern of develop-
ments indicated earlier. Inflation is still shown as being very rapid
in 1974, moderating some in 1975 and early 1976, and then accelerating
somewhat thereafter. (See Table V.)
3/The "operating" surplus/deficit is that which excludes the effect of
social insurance (pension) funds and, therefore, more accurately mea-
sures the impact of current operations.
