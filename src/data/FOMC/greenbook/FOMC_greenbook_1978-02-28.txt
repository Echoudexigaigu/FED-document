 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Retail sales, industrial production, and housing starts declined
sharply last month, in part because of bad weather. At the same time,
however, employment and earnings gains continued sizable, and consumer
confidence remained at a high level. In addition, December data
on equipment orders and inventory change suggest further growth in
business investment spending.
Labor demand remained strong in January, but bad weather
interrupted work schedules and total hours worked declined. Nonfarm
payroll employment, adjusted for strike activity, rose 225,000 in
January--an increase in line with monthly averages over the past half
year. Factory hiring totaled 85,000 (strike adjusted) with increases
widespread among producers of durable goods. In contrast, employment
fell in contract construction--a sector particularly sensitive to
unusually severe weather. In many industries, winter storms resulted
in unscheduled absences from work and apparently damped output. Average
weekly hours of production workers dropped sharply by 1/2 hour;
in manufacturing the decline was 3/4 hour. Evidence of lost work
time due to the weather also was available from the household survey.
Almost a million perons who had jobs did not work at all because of
adverse weather during the reference week, and more than 3.6 million
workers who normally work full time reported working less than 35 hours.
In both cases, the number affected was lower than during last January's
severe weather, but was sizable by historical standards.

Total employment grew slightly more than the labor force, and
the unemployment rate edged down to 6.3 per cent in January. The improve-
ment in joblessness occurred wholly among adult women; unemployment rates
for adult men and teenagers were little changed from December.
In other labor market developments, the coal strike by the
United Mine Workers continued into late February. Intermittant negotiations
have occurred, but since the ratification process requires about 10 days,
the strike will extend at least into March. Total coal stocks at electric
utilities on February 11 were estimated to average about 67 days supply,
assuming normal weather conditions. However, regional shortages (from
Illinois to Pennsylvania) have resulted in some power reductions that so
far have caused only scattered cutbacks in production--mainly in steel.
If power curtailments spread, other industries soon will be affected.
Union mines normally produce slightly more than one-half of
the nation's coal. In January, however, coal production was two-thirds
below pre-strike levels as many nonunion mines were not operating due
to union picketing, sympathy strikes, and weather-related transportation
delays.
Disruptions arising from severe weather contributed to wide-
spread declines in industrial production in January. Although output

declined in almost all product and industry categories, the most significant
factor in the 0.7 per cent drop in over-all industrial production was the
sharp decline in motor vehicle output. Auto assemblies were cut back
to a 7.9 million unit annual rate in January from 8.9 million a month
earlier. This was primarily the result of adjustments to reduce auto
inventories following weaker-than-anticipated sales in November and
December. In addition, weather-related parts shortages appear to have
exacerbated the decline in auto assemblies. A sizable drop in large-
truck production contributed to a 1/2 per cent decline in business
equipment output.
Sales of domestic cars declined 10 per cent to an 8.0 million
unit annual rate--the lowest monthly rate since the Ford strike in the
fourth quarter of 1976. Sales of imports held up better than domestics,
and imports captured their largest market share since the spring. The
drop in January sales and the persistence of the slow pace in early
February may have been in part due to bad weather. However, the
trend in domestic auto sales has been downward since mid-1977, in part
because sales in the first half of 1977 included some replacement

II -6
purchases that had been deferred as the result of the 1974-75 recession
and the auto strike of late 1976. In addition, consumer resistance
to GM's new downsized intermediate cars and to higher prices for
most models appears to be inhibiting sales.
Total retail sales were estimated to have fallen 3.1 per cent
in January; excluding autos and mainly consumption items, sales
dropped 2.4 per cent from an upward-revised December level. Spending
weakened at all major types of stores, with particularly large declines
for apparel, general merchandise and furniture and appliance outlets.
Although some slowing in consumer outlays is not unusual following
extraordinarily large gains such as those registered during the fourth
quarter, inclement weather apparently deepened the sales contraction
last months.
Despite the recent slack in sales, consumers continued to be
optimistic about the outlook for personal income and business conditions.
Both the Conference Board index of consumer confidence and the Michigan
index of consumer sentiment rose in January from December. The
Conference Board index rose to its highest level since late 1972.
Growth of total earnings which has been generally supportive
of consumer spending in recent months, remained relatively strong in January.

Nonagricultural income rose at an 8 per cent annual rate last month and
wage and salary growth actually picked up, reflecting employment gains
and a large rise in pay rates that was partly due to the higher Federal
minimum wage. By contrast, price support payments to wheat farmers were
$5 billion lower in January than in December, dividend payments declined
to more normal levels following a special large payment in December, and
social security taxes increased. These factors held the rise in total
personal income to only 3.2 per cent.
Total business inventories were lean at year-end. The book
value of manufacturing and trade inventories was about unchanged in
December, and stocks rose at only a $12.6 billion annual rate in the
fourth quarter--the smallest quarterly gain since the last quarter of
1976. Stocks of durables were accumulated at a $8.1 billion rate in
December, well below the average for the year; stocks of nondurables
were reduced at an $8.2 billion annual rate. The ratio of business in-
ventories to sales was historically quite low at year-end.
Indicators of business fixed investment spending were generally
favorable at year-end. Contracts and orders for plant and equipment rose
13 per cent in December to a level one-third above a year earlier. A
9.1 per cent advance in new orders for nondefense capital goods contributed
to the increase. In addition, construction contracts for commercial and
industrial buildings also rose sharply in December. But for the fourth

quarter as a whole, such construction contracts were down 6 per cent
from the advanced third quarter pace. By contrast, new orders for non-
defense capital goods rose nearly 10 per cent from the third quarter.
Activity in the housing sector dropped early this year following
a robust fourth quarter performance, with adverse weather effects apparently
pervasive. Private housing starts fell 29 per cent in January to a season-
ally adjusted annual rate of 1.55 million units. Declines were widespread
by regions with somewhat larger reductions in regions hard-hit by blizzards.
The decline in starts occurred for both single-family and multifamily
dwellings. Single-family starts fell 27 per cent in January from their
December high to a 1.14 million unit annual rate. Multifamily starts
last month were off 35 per cent from the previous month--when the level
of such starts had been one of the highest of the current housing re-
covery. Activity in the multifamily sector should be supported in coming
months by recent Congressional approval of an additional $2 billion for
GNMA purchase of multifamily mortgages at below-market interest rates;
three-quarters of the funds will be used to finance properties under
Section 8--HUD's principal rental assistance program.
Federal spending rose at a 14 per cent annual rate in the
fourth quarter due largely to the October Federal pay raise, higher non-
payroll defense spending, increased aid to farmers through the Commodity
Credit Corporation, and a sharp rise in interest payments. The President's
budget estimates, released in mid-January, project unified outlays of
$462.2 billion in fiscal 1978, receipts of $400.4 billion, and a deficit
of $61.8 billion.

State and local government spending has remained sluggish in
recent months. Employment growth was small in January. In addition,
State and local spending on capital projects has remained comparatively
flat despite the recent influx of Federal countercyclical aid. New con-
struction activity in December was estimated to be only 4 per cent above
the weather-depressed levels of a year ago and 12 per cent below the peak
levels of last summer.
Most recent price and cost data suggest that the underlying
rate of inflation remains in the neighborhood of 6-1/2 per cent. The
Producer (Wholesale) Price Index for finished goods rose 0.6 per cent in
January, about the same rate as in the previous three months. Prices for
finished producer goods increased less than in December but consumer goods
prices increased more rapidly, largely due to a faster price rise for the
food component.
At earlier stages of processing, the more volatile wholesale
prices in crude and intermediate markets have accelerated in recent
months following modest price increases or actual price declines through
much of 1977. Prices for nonfood intermediate materials rose 0.9 per cent
in January, with higher prices for construction-related materials account-
ing for much of the January upturn. The rate of increase in this series
had been moderate over most of last year. Prices for crude nonfood
materials rose 1.4 per cent in January, the third consecutive large
monthly increase following several months of moderate increases or out-
right declines. Prices for crude farm products--which exhibited wide

swings in 1977--have risen in three of the past four months, and as of
January had risen to the same level as a year ago. The current upswing
in farm prices has been concentrated mainly in the livestock sector;
weather disruptions, a cyclical downtrend in beef production, and a
surprisingly low level of pork production have all contributed to recent
increases in these prices.
Consumer prices rose 0.4 per cent in December, similar to the
average rate since June. As during most of the second half of 1977, a
moderation in the rise of food prices was a major factor damping inflation
although lower energy prices also helped moderate the inflation rate in
December. Service prices rose 0.5 per cent in December, more than in
November but slower than the average for the year. However, new car
prices posted another large rise due to the continued phase-in of price
increases for 1978 models. During 1977 as a whole the Consumer Price
Index rose 6.8 per cent--up from 4.8 per cent in 1976, a year in which
food prices were nearly stable. Excluding both food and energy items,
however, the increases were in the 6 to 6-1/2 per cent range in both
years.
An important determinant of this underlying inflation rate is
the movement of labor costs. Unit labor costs in the nonfarm business
sector increased at a 5.7 per cent annual rate during the four quarters
of 1977--about the same as during 1976. Total compensation per hour

continued at an historically high rate of about 8-1/2 per cent. At the
same time, the rise in output per hour during 1977 was not much above its
longer run trend of 2-1/2 per cent.
The rapid rise in labor costs last year was led by the unionized
sector. Wage adjustments, excluding nonwage benefits, in major collective
bargaining settlements during 1977 averaged just under 8 per cent for the
first contract year--about the same as the 1976 increase. First year
wage and benefit settlements in contracts covering 5,000 or more workers
averaged 9-1/2 per cent. Included among these large settlements were
those in steel, communications, containers, and metal mining, which
followed a pattern of annual increases (assuming 6 per cent inflation in
cost-of-living adjustments) of about 10 per cent annually over the life
of the contract.
The rate of wage change for all production and nonsupervisory
workers increased sharply in the first month of 1978, as the Federal
minimum wage was raised from $2.30 to $2.65 per hour. The average hourly
earnings index rose at a 14 per cent annual rate in January. Increases
were largest in low-wage sectors--trade and services--where the effect
of the minimum wage adjustments was likely more widespread.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The volume of funds raised in financial markets during
January moderated somewhat from the fourth quarter's strong pace.
Although borrowing by nonfinancial businesses at banks expanded at
about last year's average rate, some of this gain was offset by a
sharp decline in outstanding commercial paper. In the corporate
bond market, the amount of public offerings by nonfinancial firms
edged higher, but the overall volume of new issues declined due to an
appreciably smaller amount of financial issues. In the household sector,
mortgage borrowing apparently declined somewhat in January as condi-
tions tightened, and consumer instalment borrowing probably expanded
less rapidly given the reduced pace of auto sales. Public sector
borrowing remained sizable but also moderated slightly, as a drop
in advance refundings reduced tax-exempt bond offerings and Treasury
credit demands were seasonally light.
M1 growth was somewhat smaller in January than during
December, despite a surge in demand deposits in the first week of the
month. M2 growth accelerated, however, as savings and time deposits
advanced more rapidly in January than in the previous month. In
contrast, deposit growth at thrift institutions continued to slow,
so that January's increase in M3 growth was smaller than for M2.

Federal funds have continued to trade narrowly around 6-3/4
per cent, and yields on both short- and long-term Treasury and corpor-
ate securities have changed little on balance over the intermeeting
period. Municipal bond yields have declined, on the other hand, about
15 basis points, while mortgage yields have climbed 10 to 15 basis
points.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
As in other recent first months of quarters, demand deposits
grew rapidly in early January. This growth was not sustained, however,
and M1 expanded in January at a pace near December's 7-1/2 per cent
annual rate. January's M1 growth was far below the sharp advances
that have occurred in other recent first months of quarters, although
it was similar to the January 1977 experience.
Growth of savings and small denomination time deposits
accelerated in January and M2 expanded at an 8-1/4 per cent annual
rate, substantially higher than December's 5-3/4 per cent growth rate.
Most of the increase was concentrated in the early part of January,
suggesting that existing seasonal adjustment factors may not be
1/adequately capturing the effects of interest crediting.
1/ The sharp growth of savings and small denomination time deposits
over the last several years, as well as the higher average rate
paid on time deposits due to the lengthening of maturities, appears
to have produced faster growth of interest payments than is accounted
for by seasonal adjustment. Moreover, the effects of IRA and Keogh
accounts on seasonal patterns for deposits have not yet been
established.

Unlike the experience at commercial banks, the rate of
growth of deposits at thrift institutions slowed for the fifth con-
secutive month. Combined S&L and MSB deposit growth slowed to about
a 4-3/4 per cent annual rate in January (month-end basis), the lowest
for any month since 1974. Passbook accounts remained the primary
area of deposit weakness. During December (latest data available),
S&L passbook balances declined at a 2-1/2 per cent annual rate, and
New York State MSBs reported larger-than-seasonal passbook outflows.
S&L time deposit growth also slowed in December, but thrift institu-
tions rate ceilings on longer-term accounts still offered a slight
advantage over comparable market yields, and overall growth rates of
time deposits remained relatively high due to continued increases in
4- and 6-year accounts.
The increase in short-term market interest rates in early
January has had a noticeable impact on both mey market mutual funds
and noncompetitive tenders at Treasury security auctions. Total assets
of money market mutual funds climbed a record $681 million in January
after advancing $431 million during the fourth quarter. January's
gain pushed their total assets above the previous $3.9 billion peak
in May 1975. Noncompetitive tenders at weekly Treasury bill auctions
averaged almost $600 million between year-end and early February,
about $80 million above the fourth quarter average.

Total loans and investments at commercial banks advanced at
an annual rate of 12 per cent in January after showing essentially no
growth during December. January's expansion was more in line with the
8-1/4 per cent rate in the fourth quarter, and suggests that the December
slowdown probably did not signal significant moderation in demands for
bank credit. Loan growth rebounded sharply as business and security
loans accelerated, while real estate and consumer loans (which accounted
for more than one-half of total loan growth in 1977) apparently con-
tinued near December's rapid pace. Banks financed a portion of their
January growth by reducing their holdings of Treasury securities, ex-
tending the trend that began last July. Bank holdings of other
securities (mainly tax-exempts) edged higher in January following a
moderate decline in December, and are currently close to record levels.
Banks relied less on managed liabilities to finance asset
expansion in January. Total large time deposits increased about $3.2
billion (including $1.4 billion in large denomination time deposits
that are part of M2) after advancing approximately $6.6 billion per
month in the final quarter of 1977. Partly offsetting this slower
expansion was an increase in funds from nondeposit sources. Banks
raised $2.2 billion from nondeposit sources in January versus $1.3 billion
per month in the previous quarter. Nonetheless, the overall moderation
in the use of managed liabilities together with the pick-up in asset
growth produced a decline in January in the ratio of managed liabilities
to total assets at large banks; this ratio had risen steadily since
early 1977.

Business Credit
Commercial bank loans to nonfinancial businesses (net of
holdings of bankers' acceptances at large banks) grew at a 19-1/4
per cent annual rate in January, according to preliminary estimates,
following the slowdown in December (memo item 2 in table). Strength
in business lending was most evident at small banks where the almost
30 per cent annual loan growth rate in January exceeded the pace set
early last year; business loan growth at large banks--at a 10 per cent
annual rate excluding bankers' acceptances--was below the fourth quarter
pace of 14 per cent.1/
While commercial paper rates remained well below the prime
lending rate of commercial banks in January, the strong loan growth at
banks coincided with a sizable runoff in nonfinancial commercial paper
outstanding. Public utilities accounted for much of the January decline
and December's increase. Commercial paper dealers indicate that public
utility year-end cash flows were inadequate due in part to large pay-
ments associated with coal stockpiling and delays in bill payments by
customers.
/ Business loans including bank holdings of bankers' acceptances
increased at a 12-3/4 per cent annual rate in January, down from
the previous quarter's 16 per cent rate. For the past three years
holdings of bankers' acceptances at a few large banks have dis-
torted the underlying trend of total bank lending to businesses
around year-end. These large banks have accumulated acceptances
late in each year in order to maintain higher loan loss reserves
to reduce income taxes, and these accumulations and subsequent
runoffs have not been completely captured by the seasonal adjust-
ment procedure.

III -10
Nonfinancial commercial paper grew at about a 16 per cent
annual rate in the final quarter of 1977, slightly faster than the
rate of growth of business loans at commercial banks (net of large
bank holdings of bankers' acceptances). For the year as a whole,
nonfinancial commercial paper expanded nearly 20 per cent, while bank
loans to businesses grew about 14 per cent. Total nonbank-related
commercial paper expanded even more rapidly, however, due to the heavy
issuance of commercial paper by finance companies. Business and con-
sumer lending by finance companies--many of which are subsidiaries of
large industrial concerns--has grown rapidly in recent quarters,
and these companies have relied heavily on commercial paper and bond
issues to finance their lending activities. A large portion of the
recent growth in business credit at finance companies is associated
with the automobile industry, principally for the financing of dealer
inventories (floor planning) and sales contracts on commercial vehicles.
Finance company lending for business, industrial and farm equipment
also grew rapidly last year, reflecting the gains in nonfinancial
concerns' equipment expenditures. Combining the rapid growth of
business credit at finance companies with nonfinancial firms' bank
loans (net of holdings of bankers' acceptances at large banks), and
commercial paper produced a growth of 16.4 per cent in 1977 (memo
item 4 in Bank Credit table).

Although January's volume of publicly offered bonds by
utilities and industrial corporations was somewhat above December's
unusually small total, a sharply reduced supply of new bond issues by
financial concerns lowered the total slate of offerings to only $1.2
billion in January. On a seasonally adjusted basis the decline in
publicly offered bond issues was even more pronounced since seasonal
forces typically cause these offerings to increase in January relative
to December. Privately placed bond offerings are estimated to have
declined about seasonally in January, and the volume of new equity issues
remained relatively small with public utilities continuing to account
for most of the offerings. Stock prices generally have moved lower
since the last FOMC meeting.
Municipal and Treasury Securities Markets
State and local governments offered $3.2 billion of tax-exempt
bonds in January, a little below the total in December. Seasonal in-
fluences usually cause tax-exempt bond offerings to be higher in January
than in December, but advance refundings declined sharply from a
record $1.3 billion in December to only $350 million in January. The
lower level of such issues resulted in part from the Treasury's recent
ruling prohibiting the advance refunding of most industrial development
bonds.

III -14
Tax-exempt bond yields have declined about 15 basis points
since the last FOMC meeting, retracing their rise in early January.
This decline reflects the continued strong demand for tax-exempt
securities by property/casualty insurance companies (which are re-
ported to have earned record profits in 1977) and by individuals,
both directly and through tax-exempt unit trusts and mutual funds.
The Treasury has continued to borrow heavily in the securities
markets since the January FOMC meeting, raising $8.0 billion in new
money. Coupon offerings have included $7.4 billion of 2-year notes
(2 auctions) to refund $4.3 billion of maturing issues, $7.0 billion
in notes and bonds to refund $5.0 billion of debt, and $2.5 billion of
4-year notes (all for new money). Thus far this year, the Treasury
has raised a total of $10.3 billion in new money (on an offerings
basis), of which $8.4 billion has been marketable issues, nearly all
in the coupon area.
Sponsored credit agencies borrowed about $1.8 billion in
January compared with [$525 million] in December (on an offerings basis).
Although their borrowing is ordinarily seasonally low in January, the
FHLB ystemraised $850 million, up from $480 million in December. In
addition, it sold $2.6 billion in its mid-February financing to refund
$1.2 billion of maturing issues.

III -15
Mortgage and Consumer Finance
The volume of mortgage lending apparently declined somewhat
in January from the high fourth quarter level. Commercial bank real
estate loans increased about $2 billion (seasonally adjusted), slightly
below the strong pace of the two previous months. Issues of GNMA-
guaranteed securities fell off moderately, while sales to FNMA of
both Government-underwritten and conventional home mortgages expanded.
At S&Ls, seasonally adjusted outstanding mortgage commitments rose to a
record $35.2 billion at year-end, but it is likely that their net
mortgage acquisitions decline somewhat further in January (net acquisi-
tions dropped to $5.1 billion in December) reflecting reductions in
spot lending.
With the further slowing in deposit growth in January, S&Ls
continued to rely on FHLB advances and other nondeposit sources of
funds to support their mortgage lending. Contrary to the typical
seasonal pattern, outstanding FHLB advances climbed $250 million during
January.1/ On a seasonally adjusted basis, this represented a $1.0
billion increase over the month and boosted outstanding advances to
$19.9 billion, the highest level since early 1975. Advances relative
to total S&L assets remain well within their historical range, however..
1/ Outstanding FHLB advances (not seasonally adjusted) rose an addi-
tional $77 million in the first half of February. Seasonal forces
typically produce paydowns in advances in both January and February.

S&Ls apparently have become more conservative in granting longer-term
mortgage commitments, particularly to purchase loans. Average rates on
new commitments for 80 per cent, 30-year conventional home mortgages
have backed up 15 basis points since year-end, and field reports and
trade sources have indicated some tightening of nonrate terms.
In the secondary mortgage market, yields on GNMA-guaranteed
securities have risen about 25 basis points since early January after
increasing a similar amount in December. Average yields on accepted
bids in the bi-weekly FNMA auctions of commitments to purchase home
mortgages have increased at least 25 basis points since late December,
and the heavy volume of bids at recent auctions reflects in part
mortgage bankers' concerns about further increases in mortgage yields
and about possible limitations on FNMA borrowing authority.
Consumer instalment credit growth slowed to a 15.6 per cent
annual rate in December, reducing the fourth quarter growth rate to
about 16 per cent. Extensions expanded at an 18 per cent annual rate
in the final quarter, due to robust credit card and personal loan growth
combined with strength in auto credit extensions. Demands for auto
credit were boosted by higher auto prices and the sustained increase in
the average loan amount relative to the value of the vehicles. While
consumer credit expansion has been rapid in recent quarters, lender
repayment experience generally has remained favorable. Non-business
bankruptcy filings have continued to move irregularly lower, while

INTERNATIONAL DEVELPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. Over the six weeks since the last
green book, the decline of the dollar on foreign exchange markets which
began last fall has resumed. Selling pressure on the dollar was not
uniform throughout the period. In the four weeks from mid-January to
mid-February, exchange markets were generally quiet and exchange rates
relatively stable. However, after mid-February heavy selling pressure on
the dollar re-emerged. In the six week period since the last green book,
the dollar has declined by 1-1/5 per cent on a weighted-average basis,
bringing its total depreciation since the end of September to about 7 per
cent. The weighted-average dollar is currently about 1/2 per cent above
its low on January 4, just before the Treasury announcement of its swap
line with the Bundesbank.
The main factor in the dollar's most recent decline on exchange
markets remains concern over the continuing large U.S. current-account
deficit, compounded by uncertainty over U.S. economic policy, par-
ticularly in regard to energy and dollar exchange rates.
The dollar's recent depreciation has not been uniform against
all currencies, but rather has been mainly against the currencies of Japan,
Germany and Switzerland, countries with large current-account surpluses
and low inflation rates.

IV -2
Trading in the currencies of France, Canada and Italy has been
dominated by political developments recently. The French franc depreciated
by nearly 4 per cent against the dollar in the first week of February,
when speculative sales of the French currency were triggered by opinion
polls showing the parties of the left in a leading position approaching
next month's French elections.
.Political uncertainty
generated by the Quebec situation continued to depress the Canadian currency,
and the Canadian dollar declined by over 1 per cent against the U.S. dollar
over the past six weeks,
.The Italian lira, which had come under
selling pressure in January because of the fall of the minority Christian
Democrat government, recovered later in the period when it appeared that
former Premier Andreotti would be able to form a new government.
The British pound has shown little net change against the dollar
since the last green book, rising early in the period then easing back
in reaction to an unexpected deficit in the U.K. current account in January
and an increase in the money supply growth rate in the U.K.

IV -3
The recent rise of the German mark created renewed pressure
within the European joint float, and on February 10 Norway announced an
8 per cent devaluation of its currency relative to the other snake currencies.
Finland, not a member of the snake, followed the Norwegian move with an
8 per cent devaluation of the Finnish markka against a basket of currencies.
.The System sold $360 million equivalent of marks and
$70 million equivalent of Swiss francs in the New York market over the
past six weeks. This intervention raised outstanding System swap drawings
on the Bundesbank to just over $1,500 million. The U.S. Treasury also
sold $360 million equivalent of marks during the period, using the New York
Federal Reserve Bank as an agent. Total Treasury swap drawings on the
Bundesbank have increased to $670 million equivalent.
The gold price rose by nearly $10 over the past six weeks, to
above $180.

IV -4
Borrowing in international capital markets. Total gross
borrowing in international capital markets in the fourth quarter of
1977 was at the same level as in the third quarter, according to World
Bank compilations. For the year 1977 the provisional World Bank total
for borrowing in the Euro-credit, Euro-bond, and foreign bond markets
amounts to $62.5 billion, nearly unchanged from the 1976 total;
Euro-bond issues increased considerably last year, while Euro-credits
rose little and foreign bond issues declined. These figures do not
reflect the very strong upsurge in the closing months of 1977 in the
amount of Euro-credits under negotiation and not completed by year-end;
the amount of Euro-credits "in the pipeline" at the end of 1977
appears to have been about $11 billion, far more than normal.
Completed medium-term Euro-credits in the fourth quarter of
1977 exceeded the third-quarter level by about $700 million. Loan
spreads narrowed further to about 5/8 to 3/4 per cent over LIBOR for
prime borrowers. Major credits completed in the fourth quarter
included loans to the Mexican Government ($1.2 billion), Iran
($800 million for several borrowers), the International Investment
Bank in Moscow ($600 million), Spain ($500 million for various
borrowers) and the Government of New Zealand ($500 million). For 1977
as a whole, completed Euro-credits estimated at $28.5 billion
provisionally were little changed from the 1976 total. Developed nations
arranged more loans than in 1976 as step-ups in French and Swedish
borrowings (concentrated in the first half) exceeded decreases in amounts
negotiated by the United Kingdom and Spain. Oil-exporting countries

also took more from the Euro-credit market last year. Iran, the United
Arab Emirates, and Venezuela borrowed more last year than in 1976
despite continued large surpluses in the first two countries and a
considerable (although diminishing) surplus in the latter, while
Indonesia borrowed much less as its payments position improved.
The non-oil developing countries completed a somewhat smaller
volume of Euro-credits in 1977, mainly because of reduced borrowing by
Argentina, Brazil and the Philippines, although Mexico borrowed more
in this market (despite a reduced current account deficit and lower
total long-term net capital inflows) as did other non-oil LDCs as a
group. As in 1976, borrowing by the LDC's in 1977 contributed to a
rise in those countries' reserves. New credits negotiated by the
centrally-planned economies also declined last year as Eastern
European countries generally reduced their trade deficits with the West.
The credits still under negotiation early in 1978 will mainly
swell the near-term completion figures for the developed and
oil-exporting countries. These include credits to Hydro-Quebec
($1.25 billion), Venezuela ($1.2 billion), Nigeria ($1 billion),
Indonesia ($575 million to refinance earlier borrowings at lower
spreads), and large amounts for France, Italy, Spain, Brazil and Korea.
The Hydro-Quebec loan accentuates the shift of Quebec borrowing from
the U.S. bond market to the Euro-credit market.
New Euro-bond issues dropped 15 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1977 as the decline in the exchange rate of the dollar

sapped investor interest in dollar bonds. Volume declined further in
January 1978. However, D-mark issues picked up in the fourth quarter
and more so in January, when they probably accounted for one-half of
total issues compared with one-fourth in 1977 as a whole. For the
year 1977 Euro-bond issues increased 25 per cent over 1976, while
their average maturity widened from 7.9 years in the fourth quarter of
1976 to 8.8 years in the fourth quarter in 1977. Canadian issues
decreased by one-third last year but remained the largest by
nationality of borrower.
Foreign bond issues were unchanged in volume in the fourth
quarter. They show a decline of over 20 per cent for 1977, mostly
concentrated in Canadian issues

the first three quarters of 1977. However, U.S. international trans-
actions reported by banks and securities dealers showed a marked
acceleration of dollar purchases by foreign central banks; these were
largely designed to limit the appreciation of their currencies and
in some cases to provide year-end liquidity to commercial banks.
Interacting with these official actions, there was a sizable shift to
a net outflow in other recorded private capital transactions and in
the balancing item. (lines 4 and 10 above).
Foreign official assets in the United States (excluding OPEC
holdings) increased by $3.5 billion in December. This brought the total
net inflow in the fourth quarter to $14.2 billion, an amount just under
half the $29.3 billion increase for the year as a whole. Of the
December total, a $2.2 billion increase in Swiss official holdings in
the United States reflected in part the accommodation by the Swiss
National Bank, through dollar swaps, of end-of-year liquidity require-
ments of Swiss commercial banks. Both the Swiss and German central
banks intervened in order to limit further appreciations of their
currencies. Purchases by the Bundesbank totaled $1.5 billion. Because
continuing strength of the German mark and Swiss franc exerted pressures
against other European currencies, the official dollar reserves of other
European countries declined by $1.4 billion in December, with the snake
participants and Sweden accounting for $800 million of the decline.

IV -10
In January, G-10 central bank dollar purchases and U.S.
initiated swap drawings resulted in a further $3.6 billion increase
in foreign official holdings of Treasury securities. Also in January,
Germany and the United Kingdom reduced the average maturity of their
Treasury holdings, which among other things was consistent with an
expectation of a near term further rise in dollar interest rates.
OPEC banking assets and security holdings in the United States
decreased by over $700 million in December reducing the fourth quarter
rise to just over $700 million. In 1977, OPEC countries increased
their official U.S. holdings by $6 billion, a rate about $1 billion
less than that of 1976. This reduction reflected a decline in the
rate of investment to [$6.6] billion, from $7.9 billion in 1976, by the
low-absorbing OPEC countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE).
Other OPEC countries reduced their U.S. assets by $700 million compared
to a reduction of $1.1 billion in 1976.
Bank-reported private capital transactions resulted in a
net outflow of $0.6 billion in December, bringing the total net outflow
for the fourth quarter, adjusted for reporting-bias, to $2.3 billion.
The net outflow for the year was $1.9 billion, considerably below the
$10 billion net outflow in 1976.

In December, U.S. banks increased their lending to nonbank
foreigners by $1.5 billion, partially offsetting the $2.6 billion
inflow from foreign commercial banks (mainly their own foreign branches).
This switch to direct lending from head offices, rather than via
foreign branches, was motivated by tax benefits to be gained by end-
of-year placement of loans on head office books. In particular, U.S.
banks through aggressive pricing sought to generate additional
acceptance financing. In addition, the anticipation of a further
appreciation of the yen against the dollar led to an increase in the
demand for dollar financing -- particularly by Japanese and Korean
trading firms. As a result of these factors, U.S. banks increased
the amount of acceptance claims on foreigners by $700 million in
December.

IV -12
U.S. offices of foreign banks, which did not face the same
tax considerations as U.S. banks, reported a net outflow of $1.7
billion in December, Some of these dollar borrowings may have been
switched into local currencies, thereby adding to the supply of dollars
that was absorbed by official activity.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities
of $600 million in 1977 were $2.2 billion less than the 1976 rate.
This reduction largely reflected the World Bank's investment
initiative to place a portion of its dollar holdings with the foreign
offices of U.S. banks rather than limit its dollar investments to direct
U.S. holdings.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate securities. In 1977
foreign investors purchased $2.9 billion in U.S. corporate securities,
as compared to $1.2 billion in 1976. Foreign investors purchased $1.2
billion more in U.S. corporate bonds (including agency securities) in
1977 than in 1976 and $530 million more in U.S. stocks.
New foreign bond issues in U.S. markets of slightly above
$7 billion in 1977 were $3 billion below the rate recorded for 1976,
largely reflecting a reduction of Canadian issues in the United States.
The calendar for the first two months of 1978 shows about $800 million
of new foreign bends (including $600 million of Canadian issues), a
rate about equal to that of 1977's relatively depressed first quarter.

IV -13
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in the fourth quarter
was $35.5 billion at an annual rate, international accounts basis. The
staff estimates that in the fourth quarter, the longshoremen's strike,
which halted containerized shipping through Atlantic and Gulf Coast
ports between October 1 and November 29, reduced exports more than it
reduced recorded imports,with a net negative effect of about $2-1/2
billion at an annual rate. On an adjusted basis, the underlying
fourth quarter trade deficit was slightly larger than the deficits of
the first three quarters. For the year 1977, the deficit was $31.4
billion compared with a deficit of $9.3 billion in 1976.

Nonagricultural exports. Excluding the effects of the
longshoremen's strike, fourth quarter nonagricultural exports are
estimated to have increased slightly from the third quarter level
to a little over $99 billion at an annual rate, but all of the
increase was in prices; the volume was estimated to have declined
slightly. The drop in volume was largely concentrated to non-
agricultural industrial supplies (particularly chemicals and
paper). Coal exports, largely metalurgical coal, were slightly be-
low second and third quarter levels; the strike which began December
6 only began to affect exports late in the month.
Agricultural exports also were reduced by the dock strike
in the fourth quarter. Net of the effect of the strike, it is
estimated that agricultural exports were about the same value in the
fourth quarter as in the third (about $23-1/2 billion at an annual
rate). An overall 3 per cent decline in prices in the fourth quarter
(primarily soybeans and cotton) was offset by an increase in volume
(also primarily soybeans and cotton).
Nonoil imports increased sharply in the fourth quarter
despite the damping effects of the dock strike. Declines in industrial
supplies (chemicals, metals and textile supplies) were more than off-
set by increases in other commodities (particularly sugar, trucks
from Canada, and new cars from Japan and Germany.) The volume of
sugar imported in December doubled as importers accelerated shipments

IV -15
to avoid increases in duty rates that became effective January 1.
The value of foreign car imports increased by about 13 per cent in
the fourth quarter;* about 5 per cent of that increase was in price.
Foreign car dealers began to rebuild their inventories from the
very low levels of late fall, and sales were strong.
Petroleum was imported at a rate of 8.5 million barrels
per day (mbd) in the fourth quarter as stocks began to be run down.
The price of imported oil averaged $13.41 per barrel in the fourth
quarter, up about 10 cents from the third quarter.

IV -16
Foreign economic developments and prospects. Real GNP in
the six major foreign countries in 1977 is estimated to have been only
3-1/2 per cent higher on average than in 1976, while real GNP in the
smaller foreign industrial countries is thought to have grown even more
slowly. As growth lagged, unemployment abroad continued to rise last
year. What little strength there was came primarily in the first
quarter, with both GNP and industrial production generally flat or de-
clining in the second and third quarters. However, slow output growth
probably resumed during the fourth quarter. In Japan, industrial
production rose 2 per cent in 1977Q4 after having remained unchanged on
balance in the two previous quarters. Industrial production also rose in
Germany, with a 1 per cent increase in the fourth quarter. New orders
in Germany have also been rising and the unemployment rate has declined
slightly.
Significant reductions in inflation rates abroad were exper-
ienced in 1977 -- reflecting not only weak pressure of demand but also
a substantial easing in commodity prices after the runup in the early
part of last year. Wholesale price rises, which are quite sensitive to
commodity prices, decelerated especially sharply during the year, but
rates of increase of consumer prices also declined in many countries as
the year progressed.
The pattern of weaker demand abroad than in the United States
affected the distribution of current-account balances. The large in-
crease in the U.S. deficit in 1977 was accompanied by the elimination of

IV -17
the Italian and British deficits and a reduction in the French deficit --
outcomes which had been major policy objectives in those three countries --
and in a sharp increase in the Japanese surplus. The German and Swiss
surpluses persisted, as did sizable deficits in Spain, Portugal, Turkey,
most of the Scandinavian countries, and some non-oil developing countries.
The staff expects the growth of activity abroad to pick up mod-
erately this year. Real GNP in the six major countries is forecast to rise
about 4 per cent (about 4-1/2 per cent from 1977Q4 to 1978Q4). The staff
forecast is based on two considerations. First, the decline in inflation
rates -- if it persists -- may lead to lower personal saving rates (by
restoring confidence) and may therefore boost private consumption; con-
sumption will also be influenced by expected gains in personal disposable
incomes. Second, although governments are still acting cautiously, policy
is being directed increasingly toward boosting aggregate demand and
employment, given the persistence of high unemployment and the easing of
the inflation constraint. Actions to stimulate the economy recently have
been announced in Japan, following modest expansionary actions in several
countries last fall. Moreover, some easing of policy is likely in
Britain and France in the next several months and, perhaps, in Germany
somewhat later. High inflation and external payments problems still con-
strain policy in many countries, however, as do political weakness and
uncertainties.

Notes on idividual countries. In January, following
bilateral negotiations between the United States and Japan, the
Japanese government announced a target of 7 per cent real GNP growth
for FY1978 and an increase in total FY1978 budget expenditures of
about 17 per cent over total FY1977 expenditures; tax cuts may be
forthcoming as well. The Japanese also made additional quota con-
cessions (on imports of beef and citrus fruit) beyond those announced
in December, and made a general commitment to reduce their current-
account surplus. The government relaxed some restrictions on inter-
national payments at the end of January, and is undertaking a complete
review of Japan's entire system of foreign exchange restrictions.
Staff forecasts suggest that Japan's 7 per cent growth target
will not be achieved. However, there is some evidence that the inven-
tory adjustment that depressed output last year may be coming to an end.
If so, and if recent strength in new private machinery orders persists,
growth could well be faster than the 5-1/2 per cent rate now ex-
pected.
Some signs of a strengthening in German domestic economic
conditions have been evident in recent months, including a pickup in
private consumption, government consumption, and machinery investment
during the second half of 1977; a considerable increase in the volume
of orders received by German industry (especially for investment goods);
and drops in seasonally-adjusted unemployment in both December and Jan-
uary.

IV -22
The German government's annual economic report for 1978
announced goals of 3-1/2 per cent real GNP growth in 1978, a slight
decline in the unemployment rate and in the rate of consumer price
increase, and a drop in the current-account surplus. If policy
measures announced in 1977 prove insufficient to reach these goals,
further policy actions might be undertaken this summer.
On January 26, the British government announced that it will
be repaying the first credit tranche of its IMF loan ahead of schedule.
This development is indicative of the sharp turnaround that has taken
place in the UK economic situation during the past several months.
Sterling is now quite strong, the current account has moved basically
into surplus (although there was a large deficit in January), and in-
flation has been decelerating noticeably. Although activity in 1977
was quite sluggish, most forecasters expect moderate growth this year, to
be led by private consumption. National accounts and retail sales data
confirm that private consumption was strong at the end of 1977 and in
January.
In the uncertain pre-electoral period in France, well-defined
trends in the French economy are difficult to discern. Recent strengthen-
ing of retail sales and reductions in inventory levels in a number of
sectors suggest that a moderate expansion of production is likely at
least through the first quarter of this year, despite a fall in in-
dustrial production in December. The rate of increase in consumer
prices decelerated sharply in November and December -- the clearest
indication so far that the Barre stabilization program is beginning to

IV -23
achieve results in this area. Various price increases scheduled for
the early months of 1978, however, are likely to reverse, at least
partially, this recent slowing. Despite a deceleration in the rate of
wage increases in 1977, cost pressures remain strong since productivity
growth has apparently been inhibited by an increase in labor hoarding.
A revival of import demand in line with expanding activity is likely to
reverse in coming months the recent improvement in the current account,
though the current-account deficit is likely to be lower in 1978 than in
1977.
The present stagnation in economic activity in Italy appears
likely to persist in the near term. Business expectations of a pickup
in orders and production are weak. The political situation introduces
major uncertainties into the economic outlook as the Communists are
pressing for an increased role in a new government. The outgoing govern-
ment was aiming for an enlarged-public-sector deficit of 24 trillion lire
(almost 12 per cent of GDP) which would require some combination of in-
creased taxes and spending cuts; the deficit in 1977 was 20-21 trillion
lire. Given the political pressure to reflate and opposition to
effective measures to curtail the public sector deficit, the deficit may
be much larger than 24 trillion lire and could be a source of inflation-
ary pressure this year.
In Canada, strong growth of merchandise exports and strong con-
sumer expenditures are expected to contribute to a 4 per cent increase
in real GNP during 1978. Positive indications concerning the growth in

IV -24
GNP during the fourth quarter of 1977 are already becoming evident.
Industrial production rose during the fourth quarter. The trade sur-
plus rose sharply in 1977Q4 in nominal terms and, given likely price
movements, even more sharply in real terms. Further, consumer surveys
suggest a significant increase in consumer spending. However, invest-
ment is still stagnant (except in the energy sector).
Belgium and the Netherlands both turned in economic performances
in 1977 that were considerably weaker than their policymakers earlier had
hoped. Belgium plans some mild fiscal stimulus and, given its recent
price and exchange-rate performance, seems to be in a position to in-
crease its market share smong its trading partners. In the Netherlands,
the new van Agt government plans a mildly expansionary fiscal package, but
also is depending on foreign demand to sustain domestic production. The
Netherlands appears to be in a much weaker position than Belgium to retain
its market share; moreover, the van Agt government is widely viewed as
being less able to hold back wage increases than was the previous cabinet.
Measures designed to control demand and other measures focused
on supply have recently been announced in Scandinavian countries. Sweden's
fiscal 1978 budget contains a proposed deficit of roughly 8 per cent of
GNP, and is aimed at encouraging technical innovation and resource shifts
to improve international price competitiveness. In December, Norway
abandoned its longstanding policy of maintaining artificially low
interest rates (based on their views of social equity), letting rates rise
in response to market forces. This action was taken in response to strong
consumer spending and a larger than anticipated current-account deficit.

IV -25
In conjunction with the devaluation of the krone in mid-
February, the Norwegian central bank raised its discount rate from
6 to 7 per cent and a price freeze was announced.
In December, the Commission of the European Communities
announced two measures in response to unfavorable employment trends
in particular industries. A system of minimum reference prices for
steel imports (similar to that in the United States) will be in effect
for the first quarter of 1978, during which time the EC hopes to work
out bilateral agreements with the major supplier countries. Anti-dumping
duties were imposed on six iron and steel products from seven supplier
countries after imports at below minimum prices were demonstrated to
have occurred.
The EC Commission also approved a series of bilateral agree-
ments with major textile suppliers which will limit the increase in tex-
tile imports to 6 per cent per year.

APPENDIX A*
THE FEDERAL BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1979
Overview
The Carter Administration's budget for fiscal year 1979 pro-
jects unified outlays at $500.2 billion, a $38 billion increase over
fiscal year 1978. Reflecting the effects of a proposed $24.3 billion
tax cut, unified receipts are scheduled to increase by $40 billion in
fiscal year 1979 to $439.6 billion. The resulting unified budget
deficit for fiscal 1979 is expected to be $60.6 billion, just below
the $61.8 billion deficit projected for the current fiscal year. These
and other measures of the Federal budget appear in Table 1.
The major new initiative on the revenue side of the President's
budget is a $30.6 billion cut in Federal income, excise, and payroll taxes,
to be offset in part by tax reforms and energy tax proposals that would
increase revenues by $6.3 billion. The net reduction in taxes from these
proposals, however, would not be sufficient to offset the growth in
revenues resulting from the recently-enacted social security legislation
and the growth in income under a progressive income tax (see Table 2).
The outlay side of the Administration's proposed budget shows
much less in the way of new initiatives than does the revenue side. The
scheduled rise in outlays of only $38 billion or 8.2 per cent represents
a marked change from the current fiscal year, when outlays are projected
to rise by more than $60 billion. Over $30 billion of the FY'79 expansion
results from mandated increases in open-ended programs such as Medicare,
Medicaid, and Social security benefits. New initiatives in Federal spend-
ing total only $7.8 billion, or barely 1.6 per cent above the current
services level--that is, the level needed to maintain existing programs
at current levels of utilization. The bulk of these initiatives are
concentrated in the areas of defense, energy, and employment programs.
The combined Federal deficit for fiscal year 1979, which takes
into account $12.5 billion of expenditures for off-budget Federal
agencies, is projected to be virtually unchanged from fiscal year 1978
at $73.1 billion. Federal borrowing during fiscal 1979, however, is

Finance Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

expected to be about $7 billion higher than in fiscal year 1978, because
all of the deficit is expected to be financed by debt issuance. This
would be a change from fiscal 1978, when the deficit will be financed
in part by a draw down of the Treasury's cash balance.
The Administration's proposed budget for 1979 would appear, on
balance, to have a stimulative effect on economic output. The "full
employment" budget (which estimates outlays and receipts at an aggre-
gate unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent) is projected to move slightly
further into deficit, after having moved sharply into deficit during
fiscal year 1978. The quarterly pattern of the full employment budget,
however, indicates that most of the added stimulus will occur in the
beginning of fiscal 1979, with the deficit decreasing rather sharply in
subsequent quarters as a result of higher social security taxes, an
increase in marginal tax rates, and rising income (see Table 3). By the
last quarter of fiscal year 1979, the Board staff estimates that the full
employment deficit will be reduced $23.2 billion from its first-quarter
level.
A further implication of the President's proposed tax changes
will be to accelerate the present rise in the share of Federal revenues
provided by payroll taxes, in particular Social Security taxes. In fiscal
year 1979, these taxes are expected to raise almost 32.2 per cent of
all Federal government revenues, as compared with 30.5 per cent in fiscal
1977, and only 21.3 per cent in fiscal 1969. Passage of the President's
tax program would accentuate this trend by cutting income taxes while
leaving intact the recently passed Social Security tax increase.
Receipts
The Administration has proposed a net reduction in Federal income,
payroll, and excise taxes in calendar year 1979 of $24.5 billion. These
tax cuts include almost a $17 billion net reduction in personal income
taxes, nearly a $6 billion net business tax cut, and around $2 billon in
telephone excise and unemployment insurance tax reductions. More
specifically, the tax cut package includes the following recommendations,
with a summary of their direct budget costs given in Table 4.
For households the Administration proposes to reduce income
tax rates from the present range of 14 to 70 per cent to a range of
12 to 68 per cent, effective October 1, 1978. The purpose of this
reduction is to maintain consumer purchasing power by (i) offsetting
increases in the employee portion of social security taxes of $8.1
billion, 1/ and (ii) individual tax increases of $16.5 billion that

would occur due to the continued effects of rising nominal incomes and
the progressive rate structure of the individual income tax.
For business, the schedule of rates on the first $50,000 of
corporate income would be reduced. The maximum rate will also be
reduced, from the current 48 per cent to 45 per cent effective October 1,
1978, and then further reduced to 44 per cent effective January 1, 1980.
Also, the investment tax credit would be made permanent at 10 per cent
and would apply to industrial and utility structures as well as to
machinery and equipment. The credit could be used to offset up to 90
per cent of a firm's tax liabilities instead of the current 50 per cent.
The changes in the investment tax credit would be made retroactive to
January 1, 1978.
The purpose of these business tax cuts is to encourage increases
in capital formation and employment in the private sector. However,
scheduled increases in employer social insurance taxes of $10.3 billion 2/
in 1979 may make achievement of the Administration's goal much harder.
If the Administration's plans are enacted, the resulting increase in
investment in plant and equipment should aid in restraining inflationary
pressures by enhancing productivity and reducing potential capacity
shortages. To provide further relief from inflationary pressures, the
Administration has proposed reductions in telephone excise and employer
unemployment insurance taxes.
The Administration's tax package also includes a number of reform
items designed to make the tax system simpler and more equitable. First,
a $240 tax credit will be substituted for both the current $750 exemption
and the $35 general credit. Second, current deductions allowed for State
and local personal property, gas, and sales taxes will be eliminated,
while deductions for medical expenses and casualty losses would be sharply
curtailed. The package would also restrict the use of tax shelters by
eliminating the 25 per cent alternative tax on the first $50,000 of capital
gains, tightening the minimum tax on tax preference items, and limiting
the use of accelerated depreciation on real estate investment.
2/ This $10.3 billion employer share plus the $8.1 billion employee share
mentioned above sum to $18.4 billion. This equals the total of unemploy-
ment insurance and social security tax increases found on Table 2.

Tax reform on the corporate side would include the phasing
out of tax benefits associated with Domestic International Sales
Corporations and the phasing out of the deferral of taxes--until income is
repatriated--on the income of U.S.-controlled foreign corporations. In
addition, deductions for business meals and entertainment expenses would
be greatly reduced. Also, credit unions would be taxed on the same basis
as savings and loan associations, and the special bad debt allowance would
be repealed for commercial banks and would be reduced for thrift insti-
tutions. Also, tax receipts from Federal Reserve System earnings would be
reduced, since it is assumed that the System would begin making interest
payments on member bank deposits.
The combination of these tax proposals and normal income growth
is expected to increase Federal receipts from $400.4 billion in fiscal year
1978 to $439.6 billion in fiscal year 1979. This represents a 9.8 per cent
increase in revenues, in contrast to the 12.8 per cent rise expected during
fiscal year 1978.
Outlays
Federal spending as a percentage of GNP is expected to decline
to 22.0 per cent in fiscal 1979 from 22.6 per cent during fiscal year
1978. This percentage, however, is still relatively high compared with
years prior to the 1974-75 recession, as Table 5 indicates.
The rise in Federal outlays during fiscal year 1979 results
largely from increased expenditures in seven spending categories;
income security, defense, education and employment, health, energy, interest
on the national debt, and allowances. Five spending categories are slated
for relatively small increases, while four areas are expected to record
lower outlays in fiscal 1979 than in fiscal 1978.
The largest increase in Federal outlays during fiscal year 1979,
$12.4 billion, is scheduled to occur in expenditures for income security,
and most of this increase will come from the automatic adjustment of
Social Security payments and other individual benefits for inflation.
Social Security payments, estimated at $93.0 billion in fiscal 1978,
are expected to increase another $10.1 billion in fiscal 1979. This
increase, however, represents a slight decline from current services
funding, because it takes into account a proposed reduction in the payment
of retroactive OASDI benefits. Expenditures for most other income security
programs will be held to current services levels, while outlays for
unemployment insurance should decrease because of anticipated reductions
in the unemployment rate.
The major new initiative in the income security category consists.
of approximately $1.6 billion in special payments resulting from the

distribution of funds collected by the wellhead tax on crude oil to
households with no Federal income tax liabilities. 1/ If these payments
were to be included in the energy function of the budget instead of
the income security function, the net amounts (above current service
levels) of new Federal spending for income security in fiscal 1979
would be only $700 million to $800 million.
The defense category is expected to record the second-largest
increase in outlays during fiscal year 1979. Such outlays are projected
to rise $10.1 billion to a total of $117.8 billion. This increase
represents a real spending gain of 3 per cent, and approximately $1.0
billion of the increase will result from new spending initiatives above
current service levels. Much of the added funds will be used to finance
research, development, and the strengthening of U.S. ground forces for
NATO.
Health is the third outlay category slated for a major funding
increase(of about $5.4 billion). More than 90 per cent of this increase
can be traced to outlays for Medicare and Medicaid. Despite the huge
increase in expenditures for these two programs, actual outlays are
expected to run about $725 million below current services levels, as
a result of the President's proposal to contain medical cost increases.
Outlays for education and training are expected to rise $3.0
billion in FY '79 on top of the $6.5 billion increase recorded in fiscal
year 1978. About $1 billion of this increase represents an addition
to current services spending, with much of the increase going towards
youth employment programs.
Outlays in the energy category are projected to increase $1.8
billion in fiscal year 1979, following a $3.7 billion increase for
fiscal 1978. About $1 billion of the increase in outlays will go
towards expanding the nation's strategic petroleum reserve.
Interest on the national debt is expected to rise by $5.1
billion in fiscal year 1979, largely because of an increase in total
Federal debt. This outlay figure is based on the assumption that 90-
day bill rates will remain at their year-end levels.
Expenditures of $2.8 billion for allowances and contingencies
represent the final spending category to .receive a major increase in
fiscal 1979. Approximately $1.1 billion of this represents cost-of
living increases for Federal employees. The remainder is earmarked for
over-runs in existing programs and funding for new proposals not
anticipated in the formal budget.

-6-
The four categories targeted for smaller outlay totals in
fiscal 1979 are agriculture, general purpose fiscal assistance, commerce
and housing credit, and community and regional development. Agriculture
is expected to register the greatest decrease, approximately $3.7 billion,
reflecting a decline in price support and commodity credit payments. The
planned decreases are based on assumptions about domestic food production
and foreign demand for U.S. agriculture exports that might prove
optimistic. The Congressional Budget Office, which takes a less sanguine
view of things, predicts outlays for agriculture to run about $1.5 billion.
above the President's estimate for fiscal year 1979.
Over-all, the outlay side of the Federal Budget indicates
that the Administration has avoided costly new programs such as
national health insurance and held the line on spending for current
programs. The general picture, therefore, appears to be one of con-
siderable restraint in Federal spending, despite the apparent increase
in Federal outlays projected for fiscal year 1979.

1/ Entries are differences in tax levels above those
that would prevail under 1977 tax rates.
2/ Social Security rate increases of 0.4 per cent in
1978 and 0.5 per cent in 1979. The Social Secu-
rity tax increases do not include the automatic
base increases required to maintian constant
effective Social Security tax rates.
3/ Reflects the impact of tax progressivity and
income growth in Federal revenues.
4/ The amount of tax reduction for individuals
shown here differs from the amount estimated
by the Treasury on a liability basis. The
principal reason for this is that the tax
reduction provisions of the proposal would
take effect on October 1, 1978, while the
reform provisions would not take effect until
January 1, 1979. Since withholding schedules
would be adjusted in October 1978 to reflect
the amount of net tax reductions, refunds
would be required in 1979 to compensate for
overwithholding in 1978.
