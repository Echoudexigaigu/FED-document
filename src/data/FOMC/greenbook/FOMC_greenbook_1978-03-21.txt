The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity exhibited underlying strength despite the
lengthy coal strike and a continuation of severe weather. Payroll
employment increased substantially further in February while industrial
production recouped much of its January decline. In addition, the
latest Commerce survey provided further evidence that capital spending
will grow moderately in 1978. At the same time, increases in wholesale
and retail prices have been considerably larger than during the second
half of 1977, mainly reflecting sharp gains in food prices.
Employment and industrial production. Reflecting the
fundamental strength of aggregate activity, employment growth was
brisk in February. Nonfarm payroll employment (strike adjusted) rose
350,000, following a January rise of 265,000 and an average monthly
advance of 240,000 over the last six months of 1977. Widespread gains
in the private service-producing industries continued at a pace
similar to that of the second half of last year, while growth of
manufacturing employment has accelerated in recent months. The
average number of hours worked in February rose just 0.1 hour from
January's weather-depressed level. The rebound in the manufacturing
workweek was somewhat stronger, but average factory hours remained
0.6 below that for the final quarter of 1977.
Total employment edged up only fractionally in February as
a healthy gain in nonfarm employment was partially offset by a decline
in agricultural jobs. The civilian labor force was little changed in

February, and the unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage points to 6.1
per cent--the lowest level since late 1974. The drop in joblessness
occurred largely among adult workers while the often-volatile unemploy-
ment rate for teenagers jumped nearly 1-1/2 percentage points.
A special Labor Department tally of layoffs at large factories
due to energy shortages in 11 coal-dependent States totaled 9,500 during
the week ending February 18--the week in which the regular labor
market survey was conducted. At that time, establishments in the
affected areas evidently adjusted to energy curtailments by cutting
back hours of work rather than employment. Despite the continuation of
the coal strike, layoffs due to coal shortages among manufacturing
firms in the 11 coal-dependent States only had risen to 25,500 by
March 4, a small share of the 7.8 million factory workers in the
affected area. Layoffs at trade establishments were negligible,
although cutbacks in hours of work were reported.
Industrial production increased half a per cent in February
recovering much of the January decline. Output of most consumer
goods and equipment industries increased somewhat. Auto assemblies
rose by 300,000 units to an 8.2 million unit annual rate. Raw
steel production declined slightly, but output of many other
materials increased moderately. The secondary effects of the coal
strike on February industrial production are estimated to
have limited the gain by roughly 0.2 percentage point. Output in
February was at about the same level as the average for the fourth
quarter of 1977.

With the resumption of output growth, capacity utilization
in manufacturing edged up slightly in February, following a drop of
more than 1 percentage point in January. Even excluding the adverse
effects of the special factors of the past few months, the operating
rate has been little changed for more than half a year. The operating
rate in the materials sector edged down further in February and
stands significantly below its historical average.
Consumer sector activity. Compared to production, sales
apparently did not recover as fully from the severe weather. Total
retail sales rose 0.6 per cent in February after falling considerably
in January. Sales excluding autos and mainly nonconsumption items
rose 2.2 per cent after falling 3-1/2 per cent in the previous month.
Sales at food outlets increased in January and February, probably
largely because of sharp increases in food prices.
Total auto sales were at a 10.5 million unit annual rate
in February up somewhat from the January sales pace. Sales of
domestic models rose 500,000 units to an 8.5 million unit annual
rate and rose further to a 9.3 million unit rate in early March.
Foreign car sales in February edged down for the second successive
month and also were slightly below the fourth quarter average; even
so, imports accounted for 18 per cent of unit sales.
Surveys of consumer attitudes continue to indicate a
sustained high level of confidence, supporting the expectation of
a brisk recovery of retail sales. The Michigan survey indicated

a further small improvement in sentiment in February. Evaluations of
present economic conditions deteriorated about as much as they had
last winter, but this was offset by a strong increase in longer-term
expectations. The Conference Board index of consumer confidence held
near the 5-year high recorded in the January survey.
Business Investment. Severe weather apparently led to increased
inventory accumulation in January. The book value of manufacturers'
stocks increased at a $9.0 billion annual rate, as winter storms
evidently curtailed shipments more than production. The January rise
in stocks was fairly evenly divided between the producers of durable
and nondurable goods. By stage of processing, inventories of materials
and supplies declined further. However, stocks of work-in-process
increased for the second straight month and inventories of finished
goods, which had declined sharply in December, rose strongly in January.
Wholesale trade inventories rose at an $8 billion annual rate in
January, close to the average pace for the fourth quarter.
Liquidation of coal stocks has partially offset the
accumulation of other types of inventory. In the first two months of
the year, coal stocks at electric utilities, oven-coke plants, and
other coal users declined by about 62 million tons, or in value
terms about $1-1/2 billion (not at annual rate). Based on current
consumption rates, total coal stocks at electric utilities were
still estimated to average about 66 days supply as of March 4. How-
ever, there are significant regional disparities in the distribution
of such stocks.

Indicators of capital spending suggest further moderate
growth. The Commerce Department February survey of planned outlays
for plant and equipment indicates a 10.9 per cent increase for
1978, some deceleration from last year's 12.7 per cent advance.
The level of capital spending now anticipated for 1978 is virtually
the same as that reported in the Commerce December survey. However,
because actual spending in 1977 fell short of earlier expectations,
the percentage increase from 1977 to 1978 is now larger.
Contracts and orders for plant and equipment fell about 3-1/2
per cent in January after rising strongly at year-end. Nondefense
capital goods orders were responsible for the weakness in January,
declining 4.3 per cent after rising 9.3 per cent in December. The
level of these orders in January was about equal to the average for
the fourth quarter. Nonresidential construction contracts, on the
other hand, rose about 2 per cent in January. Contracts for non-
residential building, in particular, have been strong recently.
However, severe weather apparently curtailed construction activity
in January--the value of nonresidential buildings put-in-place was
4 per cent below the fourth quarter average.
Capital appropriations, which typically lead outlays by
about a year, continued at a high level in the fourth quarter. For all
manufacturing, new appropriations net of cancellations declined 1
per cent after rising sharply in the previous quarter. Excluding
the petroleum industry, where appropriations are volatile, the
total rose 9 per cent in the fourth quarter. On either basis, net
new appropriations have risen about 20 per cent over the past 4 quarters.

Residential Construction
As was the case last winter, residential construction activity
appears to have been severely hampered by the unusually bad weather. Re-
flecting both the 29 per cent (not at annual rate) drop in total private
housing starts and slower progress on units already under construction,
total residential expenditures fell 6 per cent in January to the lowest
rate since last September. In real terms, these expenditures declined
7 per cent as increases in home prices and construction costs showed no
significant slackening. Merchant builder sales also reflected the bad
weather, declining 10 per cent in January. Inventories of new homes
available for sale continued to edge up; at the end of January, these
inventories represented a 6.4 month supply.
Government Sector Activity
Federal sector spending on a unified budget basis appears to
have been about $2 billion below Administration expectations during recent
months. The anticipation of further shortfalls has prompted the Administra-
tion to reduce its estimate of fiscal year 1978 spending by around $8-1/2
billion to $453-1/2 billion. The largest downward revisions occurred in
the areas of defense, interest payments, energy, and grants for highways
and waste treatment facilities. Looking at the receipts side of the budget,
tax refund payments appear to be going out more slowly than last year. The
number of tax returns processed and the number of refund checks mailed
through the first week of March were substantially below a year earlier.

II -15
Spending by State and local governments appears to have been
slowed by bad weather. Construction outlays, which at year-end had fallen
12 per cent since the summer, dropped an additional 10.5 per cent in
January. Employment growth continued to be moderate in February, as the
build-up in new public service jobs reportedly reached its targeted goal
of 725,000 jobs.
Prices and Wages
Price increases accelerated in early 1978. This pickup mainly
reflected sharp advances in food and in items most affected by legislated
cost increases. The Producer (Wholesale) Price Index for finished goods
rose 1.1 per cent in February--significantly more than in recent months.
Most of the acceleration was due to a 2.9 per cent rise in consumer food
prices. In contrast, the price increase of consumer finished goods other
than food returned to the moderate pace of the last half of 1977. The
sharp acceleration at earlier stages of processing was also due to farm
and food prices.
Among nonfood commodities, price increases for crude (0.8 per
cent) and intermediate materials (1.0 per cent) slowed somewhat in February
but were still substantially larger than those posted during most of 1977.
Spot prices for coal jumped dramatically in response to shortages caused
by the strike.
The increase in consumer prices accelerated to 0.8 per cent in
January, after rising at about half that pace over the previous six months.
Reflecting recent increases at wholesale, consumer food prices rose sharply,

with the largest rises occurring for meat and poultry. Prices also
accelerated in those sectors most affected by the minimum wage increase.
Food away from home and housekeeping services rose at about twice the
December rate. However, energy prices continued to rise only moderately
as large stocks exerted a dampening influence.

following a 15 per cent (annual rate) increase in January when the minimum

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Borrowing by nonfinancial sectors in February continued at
about the same pace as in January, with some money and credit flows likely
restrained by weather and strike-related factors. The volume of credit
extended to businesses in both short- and long-term markets showed little
change from the previous month, although borrowing by utilities declined
noticeably. In the household sector, mortgage and consumer instalment
credit apparently continued to expand at a rate below the very high rates
late last year. Public sector borrowing moderated, as the Treasury raised
about the same amount of funds as in January while tax-exempt issues fell
off.
The key monetary aggregates weakened in February, due primarily
to a contraction in M-1. Demand deposits fell sharply, in part because of
dampening effects of the weather and the coal strike. The rate of expan-
sion of the time and savings deposit component of M-2 was little changed
from the January pace, while thrift deposit inflows slowed somewhat further.
Market interest rates generally have remained unchanged or edged
down slightly since the last FOMC meeting. Money market rates have been
anchored by the steadiness of the Federal funds rate, which has remained
around 6-3/4 per cent since mid-January. However, some market rates have
tended in recent weeks to register moderate declines following releases of
weekly monetary statistics indicating generally weaker money growth than
anticipated by many market participants. In addition, rates on short-term
Treasury bills have fallen slightly in response to increased demand for

these instruments by foreign buyers. But any tendency for a sustained
rally in financial markets has been restrained by the continued apprehension
over the declining value of the dollar in international exchange markets.
Monetary Aggregates and Commercial Bank Credit
M-1 declined at about a 4 per cent annual rate in February, re-
flecting a sharp decrease in demand deposits. This decrease is partly
attributable to the depressing effects of the severe weather conditions and
the coal strike on spending patterns as well as the lagging disbursement of
Federal income tax refunds late in the month.1/ While demand deposit flows
appear quite weak even after allowing for these special factors, some of
the remaining weakness reflects intraquarterly variability in this series
not fully captured by current seasonal factors.
The weakening in February of the broader monetary aggregates, M-2
and M-3, was mainly attributable to the decline in M-1. Although interest-
bearing deposits included in M-2 grew at about the same pace as in January,
the composition of this growth changed significantly. With market interest
yields in excess of regulatory ceilings on savings and small-denomination
time deposits at banks throughout the month, inflows of such deposits
1/ The principal effects of both the severe winter weather and the coal
strike have been to dampen retail sales and other types of economic
activity which, in turn, reduce the demand for money for transactions
purposes. In addition, income tax refunds in the last two weeks of
February were substantially less than the average of the past three
years.

decelerated toward the slow pace of the fourth quarter of 1977.1 Large-
denomination time deposits not subject to Regulation Q ceilings, but in-
cluded in M-2, increased about $3 billion last month and offset the slow-
down in savings and small time deposit inflows.
Thrift institutions reported continued weak deposit inflows
during February, as market interest rates were above ceiling rates on all
but the longer-term time accounts. The weakness of thrift flows in recent
months appears to have been most pronounced in the area of passbook accounts,
although time deposit growth also has slackened. Increases in market
interest rates early in the year enhanced the attractiveness of other in-
vestment alternatives relative to interest-bearing deposits subject to
regulatory ceilings at both banks and thrifts. Total assets of money
market mutual funds increased by more than $1 billion in January and
February combined, and the volume of noncompetitive tenders at weekly
Treasury bill auctions also was quite large.
On the asset side of commercial banks' balance sheets, total
loans and investments increased at a 10 per cent annual rate in February,
about in line with growth in January and all of last year. However, in
sharp contrast to the rundowns in holdings of U.S. Treasury issues in the

January. However, as noted in last month's Greenbook, all of the
surge in these deposits occurred early in the month, suggesting that
existing seasonal adjustment factors may not adequately capture the
full effects of interest crediting and possibly the effects of flows
into IRA and Keogh accounts.

preceding seven months, banks acquired a substantial amount of these
securities last month.1/ Growth of bank loans slowed in February to a
5-1/2 per cent annual rate, down from the 14 per cent average since mid-
1977. However, the weaker loan expansion primarily reflects the reduction
in security loans associated with a decrease in the System's outstanding
matched sale-purchase agreements. While real estate and consumer lending
appeared to slow moderately, business loans continued to expand at a rate
near last year's average pace.
Against a backdrop of continued growth in bank credit and a net
decline in demand deposits and interest-bearing deposits subject to rate
ceilings, banks increased managed liabilities $8-1/2 billion. In addition
to the increase in large time deposits included in M-2, large banks issued
$3 billion in large negotiable CDs. Banks also raised about $2-1/2 billion
from nondeposit sources, principally through Federal funds and RP borrowings
from nonbank sources.
Business Credit
The overall pattern of borrowing by nonfinancial businesses was
little changed from that of January, as business loans continued strong
while commercial paper outstanding declined and public offerings of bonds
slowed. Bank loans to commercial and industrial firms (excluding large-
1/ Not seasonally adjusted data for weekly reporting banks suggest that
growth in holdings occurred in all maturity classes and was accounted
for in large part by acquisitions by large banks outside of New York
City. An examination of the data on dealer positions suggests that
this increase in bank holdings cannot be attributed to increased ac-
quisitions by primary bank dealers in U.S. government securities.

bank holdings of bankers acceptances) grew at a 16-1/2 per cent annual rate
in February (memorandum item 2 in Commercial Bank Credit Table). At large
banks, sizable demand was evident from manufacturing firms as well as from
wholesale and retail trade concerns. On the other hand, bank loans to
public utilities declined last month; the needs of many gas and electric
utilities for external funds apparently diminished as their receipts in-
creased and these firms ran down fuel inventories which had been enlarged
in preparation for the coal strike. Utilities also accounted for much of
the $500 million decline in outstanding commercial paper issued by non-
financial businesses.1/
The strong business borrowing at banks more than offset the
decline in commercial paper issuance, resulting in expansion of total
short-term business credit at a 12-1/2 per cent annual rate--about the
same pace as in the preceding seven months. At finance companies, busi-
ness loans in January (most recent data) increased at a 15-1/4 per cent
annual rate, above the average rate recorded since mid-1977. As in most
recent months, automobile-related credit led the advance.
In long-term markets, gross public offerings of corporate bonds

bond issuance fell to less than a third of the January level and was the
lowest monthly amount in several years. Industrial bond offerings also
continued relatively light. Since last summer, public offerings by in-
dustrial corporations have been predominantly small and medium-sized issues;
only seven public offerings of $100 million or more have been brought to
market in the last six months. Partly offsetting the small volume of
nonfinancial issues, however, was an increase in bond offerings by
financial concerns--mostly finance companies.
Corporate bond yields have declined slightly since the last
FOMC meeting. The Board's index of recently offered, Aaa-rated bond
yields declined to 8.65 per cent in mid-March, but remains close to its
highest level since mid-1976. Stock prices have edged higher since the
last FOMC meeting, retracing a small portion of their sharp decline since
the beginning of the year.
The retreat in stock market prices since year-end has reduced
the market value of virtually all stocks, although equity prices of
smaller firms have performed somewhat better than those of large industrial
concerns. Most corporations have continued to report earnings gains in
recent months, and the further decline in stock prices has resulted in re-
duced price-earnings (P/E) ratios. The P/E ratio of the S&P 500, for
example, is 8.1, as compared to an average of about 14 for the last decade.
Also, average dividend yields are at their highest levels in 25 years.

III -11
Government Securities Markets
Treasury borrowing has continued at a moderately strong pace during
the intermeeting period. New money offerings included $3.0 billion of
short-term cash management bills as well as $300 million of bills in
regular weekly and monthly auctions. While Treasury demands for credit
were substantial during the first two months of the year, it appears that
borrowing--especially through marketable securities--is falling below the
pace anticipated by the Treasury's quarterly financing announcement in late
January.
Foreign official institutions have continued to be heavy pur-
chasers of marketable Treasury securities, reflecting heightened inter-
vention to support the dollar in international exchange markets. Following
net acquisitions of about $13 billion in the final quarter of 1977, System
holdings in custody for foreign accounts increased by $8.6 billion through
the first week in March. Custodial holdings surged by $5.0 billion in the
latter half of February and in early March, with well over half of this
most recent increase apparently accounted for by acquisitions of Treasury
bills.1/
Sponsored credit agencies borrowed about $1.6 billion during
February, following net debt issuance of nearly $1 billion in the preceding
month. By comparison, agency borrowing totalled about $2 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1977. The Federal Home Loan Banks' mid-quarterly
1/ In addition, foreign accounts have purchased nearly $400 million of non-
marketable securities so far this year. Sales to State and local govern-
ments of nonmarketable arbitrage issues, while slowing from the excep-
tionally rapid pace of the fourth quarter, have amounted to $1.5 bil-
lion since the first of the year.

III -12
financing accounted for the bulk of the growth, although borrowing by
FNMA also increased significantly during February. The recent expansion
in borrowing by sponsored agencies reflects their support of the mortgage
markets in the face of slackening deposit growth at banks and thrifts.
The volume of municipal bond offerings declined $400 million to
$2.8 billion in February. Preliminary data indicate that this larger-than-
seasonal decrease can be attributed in part to a reduced volume of general
obligation financings by smaller borrowing units. On the other hand, issues
sold to advance refund outstanding obligations increased to about $650 mil-
lion in February, with more than one-half of this total accounted for by
a single issuer.
Yields on long-term tax-exempt securities have edged down since
the last FOMC meeting, and currently are near their lowest levels of the
year. This downward movement has caused the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable
bond yields--as measured by Moody's index of Aaa-rated, new issue municipal
bond yields and the Board's index of recently offered, Aaa-rated utility
bond yields--to move close to its lowest level on record (chart).
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage activity in February apparently continued to diminish
from the record pace of late last year. At commercial banks, the increase
in mortgage loans last month was the smallest since early 1977. Growth
of S&L mortgage portfolios slowed markedly in January (latest data avail-
able). In addition, mortgage commitments outstanding at S&Ls declined in

January--the first decrease in more than three years.1/ Outstanding mortgage
commitments at New York MSBs--which account for more than half of MSB in-
dustry assets--declined in both December and January, presaging a slowing of
MSB mortgage lending.
Issues of GNMA-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities fell off in
February, in part because of a slowdown in originations of FHA/VA mortgages
at mortgage companies and other lending institutions. At the same time,
deliveries of FHA/VA mortgages to FNMA increased as prices offered under
previous commitments apparently were attractive relative to GNMA issues.
FNMA has more than $6 billion in purchase commitments outstanding--still
well below levels of nearly $10 billion in mid-1973.2/3/
Average interest rates on new commitments for home mortgages at
a sample of S&Ls have changed little since the last FOMC meeting; at 9.15
1/ Despite the recent slowdown in mortgage lending, S&Ls have continued to
rely heavily on FHLB advances, as deposit flows have weakened substan-
tially from the rapid pace last year. Such advances have increased
$2.3 billion in the first two months of the year to bring the seasonally
adjusted total above the previous record level of December 1974.
2/ FNMA's debt ceiling under continuing review by HUD. It does have sources
of funds other than net new borrowing to help support its purchase pro-
grams, including loan sales and repayments of mortgages of over $800 mil-
lion per quarter from its $35 billion mortgage portfolio.
3/ The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation currently has about $1 bil-
lion in purchase commitments outstanding, mostly to S&Ls. Although FHLMC
has authority to borrow funds through the FHLB System, its primary ob-
jective is to enhance the liquidity of conventional mortgages. Thus, it
has been closely matching mortgage purchases with sales through issuance
of Participation Certificates.

per cent, these rates stand 20 basis points above the level of late
December.1/ Field reports and trade sources suggest that nonrate terms
and credit standards have tightened somewhat in recent months, reflecting
the reduced deposit flows.
Mortgage rates in the secondary markets also are about unchanged
since the February FOMC meeting, following increases on the order of 50
basis points over the two previous months. Vith 8-1/2 per cent government-
underwritten home mortgages selling at discounts of 5 points or more in the
secondary markets, the ceiling rates on such loans were raised to 8-3/4 per
cent at the end of February. The interest rate ceiling for multifamily
mortgages remained unchanged at 9 per cent.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer instalment credit outstanding slowed during
January to an annual rate of 13-3/4 per cent, compared to almost 17 per
cent for all of last year. Weakening auto credit extensions by commercial
banks and finance companies contributed to the slowdown, reflecting the
declines in auto sales in recent months. However, lower percentage down-
payments and increasing automobile prices have contributed to a rapid
gain in the average size of new-auto contracts at finance companies,
1/ Usury ceilings may be constraining home mortgage lending in some states.
Five states currently have interest rate ceilings of 9 per cent or less.
However, FHA/VA mortgages are exempt from the ceilings in all of these
states, and in some cases lenders can increase the effective yield on
conventional loans through discount points.

partially offsetting the impact of the reduction in unit sales on instal-
ment credit. A sharp contraction of home improvement loans apparently
was associated with the adverse weather conditions.
Commercial banks in several areas where production and employment
were hampered by severe weather or the coal strike have indicated increased
consumer loan delinquencies. Certain banks have granted temporary amnesties
on instalment payments or have extended the deadline for currently-due pay-
ments. Also, some institutions report that demand for refinancing of
existing obligations is strong.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. In the three weeks since the last
green book the dollar has fluctuated widely in anticipation of, and in
reaction to, various measures to halt the dollar's decline. These included
(a) the tightening of exchange controls and the reduction of the discount
rate by the Swiss during the first two weeks of the period, (b) similar
measures by the Japanese this week, and (c) the announcement on Monday by
the U.S. and German governments of a doubling of the Federal Reserve-
Bundesbank swap line to $4 billion and the Treasury's sale of 600 million
SDR's (about $730 million equivalent) to the Bundesbank for marks. In
addition, downward pressure on the French franc reversed itself this week
following the first round of French elections. On net over the period,
the trade-weighted value of the dollar has appreciated 1/3 per cent,
reducing its decline since late September to 7 per cent.
.The Desk sold $567
million equivalent of marks during the period. Half of these mark sales
were for the System's account and half for the Treasury's, and they increased
the System's swap debt to the Bundesbank to $1,795 million (and the
Treasury's swap debt to $951 million). The System's share of the unre-
alized loss on these drawings now stands at about $36 million. Since the
end of February the System has also purchased small amounts of marks
, increasing its mark balances by $32 million

equivalent. The System also purchased $22 million equivalent of Swiss
francs from the Swiss National Bank during the last three weeks to reduce
the 1971 Swiss franc swap debt to $426 million. The Swiss franc swap debt
incurred in January and February of this year remained unchanged at $69
million.
The Japanese yen continued under very strong upward pressure
during the period, rising 2-1/2 per cent against the dollar,
.This morning (March 15) the
Japanese announced:
a) a ban on purchases by non-residents of domestic Japanese bonds
that mature in less than five years.
b) an increase in the marginal reserve requirement on non-resident
yen bank accounts from 50 to 100 per cent, and
c) a 3/4 percentage point cut in the Bank of Japan's discount
rate to 3-1/2 per cent.
After appreciating about 32 per cent against the dollar during
the previous twelve months, the Swiss franc reached a peak of 55.7 cents
on February 23. Since then, in highly volatile trading, the Swiss currency
has fallen back about 8 per cent in response to the announcement of a series
of new Swiss capital controls. The most important of these measures were:
a) an almost complete ban on the sale of Swiss franc denominated securities
to non-residents, and b) imposition of a negative interest rate charge on

IV 3
Swiss franc balances held by foreign central banks. In addition, on
February 27, the Swiss central bank lowered its discount rate 1/2 per-
centage point to 1 per cent.
The French franc was under some downward pressure through last
Friday in advance of the French elections,
.However, when the left-
wing parties did less well in the first round of the elections last Sunday
than had generally been expected, the pressure on the franc reversed, and
the French currency quickly rose about 3 per cent.
Downward pressure on the Canadian dollar continued during the
last three weeks, and the Canadian government took several steps to support
its currency.
, and it announced that
it would sell $750 million of Canadian government bonds in the U.S. Also,
on March 9 the Bank of Canada increased its discount rate 1/2 percentage
point to 8 per cent. During the last 14 months, Canadian reserves have
decreased by about $2 billion to a level of $3-3/4 billion, of which only
about $1-1/2 billion is foreign exchange.
Gold initially rose about $7.00 to a peak of $190 on March 8 -
the first time it has reached this level since late 1974. The price since
then has fallen back slightly to its present level of about $187.
Effective March 16 the National Bank of Belgium cut its discount
rate from 6.5 to 6 per cent.

U.S. bank lending to foreigners. Claims on foreign countries
held by domestic offices and foreign branches of U.S. banks continued
in the fourth quarter of 1977 to rise more slowly than in the compar-
able period of 1976. For 1977 as a whole, U.S. banks increased their
claims on foreign countries by 13 per cent, compared with almost
24 per cent in 1977. Claims on international financial cneters (G-10
countries, Switzerland, and offshore banking centers) increased by
$10.5 billion, not much more than one-half as much as in the previous
year. To a limited extent the decrease reflected the fact that Swiss
banks' seasonal demand for liquidity from the Euro-currency market was
less intense in December 1977 than at the end of 1976. However,
because most of the claims on international financial centers are
interbank placements, it is not possible to say to what extent (if
any) their smaller rise in 1977 reflected less buoyant demand for
credit in those countries themselves rather than slackening credit
demand in the rest of the world which borrows from banks in interna-
tional financial centers, or a decrease in interbank redepositing
relative to credit demands from final borrowers.
Claims on countries in the rest of the world rose about
$17 billion last year compared with $21 billion in 1976. Most of this
slowing was concentrated in the non-oil developing countries, and all
of that can be accounted for by three countries -- Brazil, Mexico, and
Peru. Both Brazil and Mexico achieved large reductions in their cur-
rent account deficits last year as a result of slower domestic

economic growth or devaluation. This diminished their needs for
external credit, and the figures for U.S. claims on those countries ih
part reflect those developments as well as the recently increased
ability of Brazil and Mexico to raise funds in the Euro-bond market.
The very small amount of the rise in claims on Mexico also reflects
some special factors including a bunching of repayments in late 1977
and possibly an enlarged role for non-U.S. banks in lending to Mexico.
In the case of Peru, the near-absence of any increase in U.S. bank
claims in 1977 was indicative of the unwillingness of banks to lend
further sums to Peru until that country took decisive action to cor-
rect its external payments deficits.
Last year saw a smaller rise in U.S. bank loans to Eastern
Europe, as several countries in that area reduced their trade deficits
with the rest of the world. Although claims on the smaller developed
countries rose somewhat more in 1977 than in 1976, the pickup was
considerably held back by a leveling early in 1977 in claims on South
Africa, to which banks became reluctant to lend, and in claims on
Turkey, where economic difficulties made banks unwilling to increase
their exposure.

U.S. International Transactions. The U.S. trade deficit
widened in January to a rate well above both the December rate and the
average monthly rate for the year 1977. Both exports and imports declined,
though exports by a substantially greater amount. Private capital
flows reported by banks showed a larger net outflow in January,

probably reflecting a seasonal reversal of some year-end inflows.
Private dealings in securities showed both a reduction in net foreign
purchases of U.S. corporate stocks and Treasury securities, and an
increase in U.S. purchases of new foreign bond issues. Official
foreign assets in the United States increased by $2.8 billion (excluding
OPEC), somewhat less than in December. The rate of increase in these
official holdings increased again in February and March,
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit was estimated to be $37
billion at an annual rate, international accounts basis, compared with
$29 billion in December, and $31 billion for all of 1977. Exports fell
by nearly $12 billion at an annual rate from levels in December that
had been inflated by makeup of shipments that had been delayed by the
dock strike in preceeding months. Imports declined by $4 billion,
also from very high December levels.
Trade data for January are still at a preliminary stage of
compilation because of delays caused by several major revisions in
the methods by which the data are assembled by the Census Bureau.
The most notable change involves the presentation of import statistics
on a date of arrival basis. Formerly, imports were recorded as of the
date that documents were filed and duties paid, which can be up to
ten weekdays after the physical arrival of the goods. This revision
places the recording of imports on a basis that is more consistent
with the recording of exports. The prior inconsistency between imports

-9
IV
and exports was a source of significant distortion, for example, in the
measurement of the impact of the East and Gulf Coast dock strike late
last year on the trade balance. Because of delays caused by this and
other changes in the methods of data compilation, most of the normal
commodity details and price-volume breakdowns are not .yet available
for January.
From the information that is available at this time (which
may be subject of substantial further revision), it appears that the
decline in exports from December's high level was broadly based across
major commodity categories. In most eases, the levels achieved were
little changed from average levels for the year 1977, during most of
which exports stayed flat reflecting the slow growth in activity abroad.
For the materials category, however, there was a substantial drop in
January (by $2 billion at an annual rate) from the 1977 average. This
drop reflected in part a decline in coal exports resulting from the
coal strike and in part the impact of weather-related transportation
difficulties at several ports.
Imports in January, while below December levels, were in
most cases well above their average levels for the year 1977. The
rise in total imports was about what might be expected from the growth
in real GNP over the past year. Imports of fuels were down sharply
from the 1977 average, however, as domestic stocks were drawn down from
unusually high levels. The coal strike had probably not yet affected
the demand for oil in January.

-10 -
IV
Bank-reported private capital transactions showed a net
outflow of $3.7 billion in January, a substantial increase over the
average monthly net outflow recorded in late 1977. This increase
included a substantial rise in funds made available by U.S. based banks
to their foreign branches. Part of this increased outflow may have
reflected an unwinding of seasonal increases in liabilities taken at
the end of 1977 for tax purposes.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks fell
to $14 million, compared with a monthly average of $125 million in the
second half of 1977. Foreign private net purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities also fell in January.
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities rose in January to
a level about in line with the monthly average for 1977. New foreign
bond issues, amounting to more than $700 million, included two large
Canadian issues. The Government of Canada, which has not borrowed in
the U.S. market for over a decade, is scheduled to market a $750 million
issue in the second quarter. This issue has been slated as a source
of funds to help finance the expected Canadian current account deficit
in 1978.
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities in January also
included up to $200 million of yen-denominated bonds, while U.S.
residents continued to sell off their holdings of Japanese corporate
stocks. The shift into Japanese bonds away from Japanese stocks
continues a pattern established in 1977, which may have reflected the

-11 -
IV
anticipated impact of the yen's appreciation on the earnings prospects
of export-oriented Japanese corporations.
Foreign official assets in the United States (excluding
OPEC's) increased by $2.8 billion in January, down from December's
increase, but slightly above the average monthly rate for 1977.
OPEC banking and security holdings in the United States
increased by $1.0 billion in January. Most of that increase has been
held in the form of repurchases agreements, which are essentially
overnight investments involving Treasury securities. Preliminary
indications for February are that OPEC holdings remained little changed
from their end-January level.

IV -12
Foreign economic developments. Growth in foreign industrial-
ized countries was generally weak during 1977. However, there are
indications that in at least two of the major countries -- Germany and
Japan -- output growth strengthened toward the end of last year and has
continued its recovery in the beginning of this year. For the 3-month
period ending January 1978, German industrial production was 2.3 per
cent above the level for the preceding 3-month period, and Japanese in-
dustrial production was 2.1 per cent higher. A pickup in these two
countries is corroborated by fourth-quarter GNP data, especially for
Germany. An interesting aspect of recent German and Japanese production
activity is the relative strength of fixed investment. Moreover, latest
figures on domestic orders for capital goods in Germany indicate that
the German recovery in capital-goods production may continue in 1978.
These signs of strength in Germany and Japan may be transitory, but,
nevertheless, they are encouraging, particularly since recovery in these
two economies is often viewed as crucial to a satisfactory recovery of
the rest of the industrialized world. So far, output growth remains
generally sluggish in the other major foreign industrialized countries.
Inflation rates have continued the downward trend generally
established in 1977, but rates of increase in consumer prices remain
relatively high in most countries. The current-account performance has
been mixed and current-account imbalances persist. Some countries have
continued to reduce their deficits, but Japan's current account in Jan-
uary again recorded a strong surplus. (A preliminary report indicates
that the February current account was even larger.)

Notes on individual countries. Preliminary 1977 German
national-accounts data indicate that real GNP rose 5.3 per cent
(s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter. Particularly strong expansion
occurred in fixed investment, which increased 6.7 per cent, follow-
ing an equally strong increase in the third quarter. Construction
also picked up in the fourth quarter. New orders to manufacturing
industry through January 1978 showed little change from their de-
pressed mid-1977 level, but there has been an upward trend in
domestic orders for capital goods, which were more than 10 per cent
above year-earlier levels in each of the most recent four months.
Reflecting this trend, capital goods output in January was 3-1/2 per
cent (sa.) above the December level.
Progress on the two key economic fronts in Japan -- more
rapid expansion of the domestic economy and reduction of the current-
account surplus -- has been mixed. In January the index of industrial
production (s.a.) rose for the third consecutive month; this increase,
together with a continuing decline in the ratio of inventories to ship-
ments, suggests that domestic activity may finally be starting to re-
cover from the slump it has undergone since mid-1977. Revival of domes-
tic demand will be helped by a moderate cut in personal income taxes
that apparently will be added to the government's already expansionary
budget for FY1978 (which starts in April). Budgetary expenditure also
will be heavily front-loaded to generate a strong stimulus in the first
half of FY1978. Unemployment, however, remains historically high in

IV -17
Japan, and increased lay-offs are expected in the next few months in
industries that have been adversely affected by appreciation of the
yen. The current account in January was very strongly positive
($18 billion, s.a.a.r.), and the current-account surplus for FY1977
(ending in March) is now expected to reach at least $12.5 billion --
more than $2.5 billion above the government's most recent official
forecast in October.
The British current-account deficit in January has created
some doubts about the U.K.'s external situation, although most
observers still forecast a substantial current-account surplus for
1978. The February current-account figure showed a strong recovery --
to $357 million, an increase of $810 million -- and reinforces the
view that the current account will be in surplus for the year. Recently,
British money supply (sterling M3) growth has been somewhat above the
government's target rate and it is expected that the nature of the
target will be changed in April. It is also widely expected that the
April budget will contain a fairly extensive fiscal stimulus intended
to boost domestic production, which has shown little evidence of
buoyancy despite recent strength in personal consumption and private
fixed investment.
The external situation in Italy has continued to show sig-
nificant strength throughout the winter months. For 1977 the current-
account surplus is now estimated to be in the $2-2.5 billion range,
attributable in part to an improved trade account but also to a sub-
stantial improvement in tourism and emigrant remittances. The strong
external situation has allowed Italy to continue to repay its external
indebtedness on schedule.

IV -18
Canadian GNP growth fell back in the fourth quarter but re-
mained moderately strong, with the external sector providing much of
the strength. On February 23, in response to the weakness of the
Canadian dollar, the federal government announced its decision to
borrow abroad for the first time since 1968. The $750 million loan
(all figures are in U.S. dollars) in 3 equal tranches due 1983, 1985,
and 1998 roughly equals Canada's February loss of foreign-exchange re-
serves. The government announced also that it had drawn $200 million
on its standby credit with Canadian banks of $1.5 billion. Further,
after a period of inactivity, several provincial borrowers also made
known their intention to borrow a total of $250 million on foreign
markets. On March 9, in another measure aimed at strengthening the
Canadian dollar, the Bank of Canada raised its discount rate from 7-1/2
to 8 per cent.
In Switzerland, the appreciation of the Swiss franc has
created problems for the international competitiveness of the indus-
trial sector. Until recently, it appeared unlikely that the government
would do anything to alleviate these problems, but the sharp apprecia-
tion in February has produced a sudden and dramatic shift in Swiss ex-
change-rate policy. A variety of measures were taken to discourage
capital inflows, including the banning of foreign purchases of Swiss
securities.
Economic policy in the Scandinavian countries continues to
be dominated by the need to reduce current-account deficits through
the restoration of price competitiveness. Norway's mid-February

IV -19
devaluation of the kroner by 10 per cent was accompanied by a
tightening of monetary policy and wage and price controls. Finland
followed Norway's lead with an 8 per cent devaluation of the markka.
There does not appear to be significant pressure on Sweden or Denmark
to devalue since the Swedish kroner was automatically adjusted to the
new rates, and Denmark's current account and reserves are improving.

IV -20
Trade balances in the six major foreign industrial countries
in 1977. The trade deficits of France, Italy and the United Kingdom de-
creased during 1977, while the trade surpluses of Canada, Germany and
Japan rose. The combined swing in the trade balances for the six countries
was over $20 billion during the year, with Japan accounting for about one
third of the change. Most of the change resulted from shrinking import
volumes, while export volumes expanded, though at a slower pace. Some of
the gain also resulted from a slight improvement in the terms of trade for
the average of the six countries. (See table.) Also, for each of the six
countries, current-account deficits declined or surpluses grew during the
year.
Changes in trade balances are decomposable, approximately, into
changes in the volume of exports relative to the volume of imports (i.e.,
relative trade volumes) and changes in relative unit values (i.e., the
terms of trade). In each of the six major countries, relative trade volumes
rose. In Canada and Japan -- the two largest trading partners of the United
States -- large increases in export volumes contributed significantly to
this pattern, whereas weak growth or actual declines in import volumes were
the most significant factors in the other countries. There was no discern-
able trend in the terms of trade. The depreciation of the Canadian dollar
caused a significant decline in the Canadian terms of trade, partially
offsetting the rise in relative volumes. In contrast, the appreciation of
sterling contributed to a rise in the U.K. terms of trade.

IV -21
Whereas relative trade volumes increased in all six countries
last year, the movement in relative trade volumes varied widely across
countries in 1975 and 1976. In both years, the volume of exports in-
creased relative to imports -- by varying degrees -- in Canada, Italy,
Japan and the United Kingdom while it decreased in France and Germany.
Similarly, changes in the terms of trade varied widely.
A recent study by the staff was conducted in order to determine
the effect of changes in relative demand and in relative domestic prices
and exchange rates upon changes in the volume of exports and imports
across the OECD countries during recent years. The results of the
analysis demonstrate that relative demand factors affect trade volumes
significantly and rather quickly, while prices and exchange rates affect
trade volumes to a much lesser extent and only after one to two years.
Following the 1974-75 recession, the expansion of worldwide de-
mand was reasonably uniform, with the demand in the six major foreign
countries, on average, expanding at a rate similar to that of their
trading partners. Accordingly, for the six countries combined, the
volume of exports and imports rose at roughly similar rates. In contrast,
as domestic activity weakened in the six countries during 1977, exports
rose sharply relative to imports.
Of course, other factors affected the change in trade balances
in 1977, such as the increased production of North-Sea oil and the drought
in France during 1976. However, relative demand factors -- especially
since the terms of trade have been relatively constant -- seem to have had
a predominant effect.

APPENDIX A*
CPI REVISION
With the January CPI report the Bureau of Labor Statistics
introduced a new index covering the expenditures of all urban consumers
(about 80 per cent of noninstitutional civilian population) as well as
its revised index for the previously covered population of wage earners
and clerical workers (about half the urban grouping). The unrevised
index will be continued through June to facilitate the changeover for
users.
The CPI measures the changing cost of a fixed basket of goods.
Because consumption habits and available products change over time, the
CPI has undergone a number of revisions for the purpose of updating the
basket of goods and also to improve the statistical techniques used for
constructing the index.
For this fifth major revision, a new survey of consumer
expenditures patterns was undertaken in 1972-73 to update the previous
market basket which was based on a survey taken in 1960-61. An additional
survey was made of where people do their shopping as an aid in selecting
retail stores to be included in the canvass.
The revision has improved the statistical foundation of the
index in a number of additional ways. Data are being collected on a
more timely basis. Data which previously had been collected quarterly
are now collected bimonthly, and the percentage of items that are priced
on a monthly basis has been increased from 48 per cent to 53 per cent.
Food is now priced throughout the month instead of at the beginning of
the month. And, the rent survey now reflects the increase in rent since
the previous month, rather than the change from six months earlier. In
addition, the geographic coverage has been expanded from 56 urban areas
to 85.
It is not known whether the two new indexes will diverge to
any significant extent. There are observable differences in expenditure
weights for some items (as shown in the table below) and any pronounced
price movements in those components could cause the indexes to diverge.
For example, housing costs which have been rising at rates well above the
average rate of inflation have a significantly higher relative importance
in the all-urban index than in the revised wage earner index. Food, on
the other hand, has a lower weight in the all-urban index than in the wage
earner index. Divergence also would occur if Price changes at outlets
patronized by wage earners differ from those at stores patronized by nonwage
earners.

A CLOSER LOOK AT AUTO DEMAND
Auto sales averaged 10.2 million units at an annual rate in January
and February, off half a million units from the fourth quarter pace and the
lowest rate since the Ford strike in late 1976. The lower volume is partly
a result of unusually bad weather but sales of domestic-model autos have
trended unevenly lower since the middle of last year, raising serious con-
cerns about near-term prospects for this important sector. This appendix
reviews the recent situation, presents factors believed to be dampening
current sales, and then examines the longer-run determinants of auto demand.
THE RECENT SITUATION
Total unit auto sales reached an 11.7 million unit annual rate in
the second quarter of 1977, and have declined in each quarter since then.
The high level of sales early in 1977 was partly a result of temporary factors:
(1) sales that were deferred as a result of the Ford strike as well as
shortages of the popular General Motors redesigned large models; (2) replace-
ment, demand which was deferred during the 1974-75 recession was probably
completed during the early months of 1977;1/ and (3) a sharp rise in foreign
car sales which may in part have resulted from an emotional reaction to the
President's energy message last April.2/
* Prepared by Susan U. Burch, Economist, National Income Section, Division
of Research and Statistics.
1/ In the 1973-74 period, there was a 2 million unit decline in the capital
stock of autos which was not made up until 1977-I. Some additional short-
fall from a 'desired' capital stock might be inferred because of income
and population growth after 1973, if the premise is accepted that the
capital stock was not undesirably high in 1972.
2/ In April and May, the market share of foreign cars averaged almost 22
per cent--up sharply from 16 per cent in first quarter and well above
the 10.5 per cent share of the third quarter.

B -2
In the current quarter, by contrast, adverse weather has had a
dampening effect on the sales pace but even aside from these factors
sales have drifted lower since last spring. This weakness appears to be
due to several cyclically sensitive factors.
(1) Prices of new cars relative to the prices of nondurable
goods and services improved steadily from 1954 to 1974, but there has
been no further improvement over the past three years (Chart 1).
Because of the treatent of some safety and environmental control items
as quality improvements in the official price measures, the relative
price problem may actually be worse than the Chart indicates. The share
of household disposable personal income which is absorbed by the average
new car purchase--total price without removing quality adjustments--has
trended upward the last few years. At 33.3 per cent of DPI in 1977-IV, the
average new car purchase price--as translated into the GNP new auto
component--was up from the 1973 average of 31.3 per cent, when the market
share of large domestics was notably higher. Despite substantial growth
in income, the price of a car relative to income is now as high as it
was in the mid-sixties.
(2) The ratio of used car prices to new car prices has beun
to level off. Since more than two-thirds of new car purchases are
accompanied by a trade-in, this development could effectively increase
the out-of-pocket cost of a new car. This ratio could come down further
in the near term. This is because used car prices surged to very high
levels early last year due to the shortage of 1974-75 large cars avail-
able for the used car market.3/ Over the longer term, used car prices
relative to new car prices were up quite dramatically in the 1970's from
the general range maintained throughout the 1960's.
(3) As is normal in the later years of an expansion, the burden
of installment credit has increased. The share of disposable personal
income devoted to repayments was 15 per cent in the second half of 1977,
almost one percentage point higher than earlier in the recovery and the
highest share since mid-1974. While this is not unusually high
3/ In the not too distant future, this shift should be eliminated by the
high volume of cars sold in the 1976-77 period.

B-3
historically (in 1970-I the ratio reached a record 15.9 per cent), it
is clear that households do not have the leeway which they had earlier
in the recovery to take on more debt.
(4) Although consumers evidently remained optimistic in
February despite the unusual weather problems, the two major attitudinal
surveys report the consumer somewhat less interested in cars than earlier
in the current expansion. In the Conference Board survey, for example,
plans to purchase new cars were expressed by 4.5 per cent of the respondents
in February. This contrasts with 6.5 per cent planning to buy a new
car in December 1976. Work based on the Michigan survey question on
market conditions for autos suggests that sales would have been 275,000
units higher in the final months of 1977 if evaluations had remained at
the level of 1977-I.
(5) Finally, there is the problem of the unpopularity of the
new General Motors intermediate-sized cars. It is, of course, still
possible that the public will come to like these trim but expansive
cars this spring when the major selling season starts. In 1957, how-
ever, the public did not like the Edsel and did not buy it despite
a vast amount of publicity and a whole new dealer network.
FUNDAMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF AUTO DEMAND
An analysis of the fundamental factors affecting underlying
trends in automotive demand for the 1952-69 period suggested that 20 per
cent of the longer-run increase in car demand was attributable to income
growth, 30 per cent was from the trend toward multi-car ownership, and
50 per cent can be explained by the increase in the number of households.4/
In this section the longer-term trend for auto demand is evaluated by
looking at prospects of these three determinants.
Income Growth. Real income growth is currently projected to
increase a strong 5 per cent over the year. This alone implies more
than a 600,000 unit increase in sales to a level of 11.4 in 1978-IV.
4/ R.P. Smith, Consumer Demand for Cars in the USA, Cambridge University
Press, 1975.

B-4
Discretionary purchasing power (DPI less such basics as food, utilities,
andmedical costs) was 58.9 per cent in the fourth quarter--up marginally
from a year-earlier and more than a point above the 1975-I trough of the last
recession.
Multi-car Ownership. The government has not collected informa-
tion on multi-car ownership since the 1974 energy crisis. However, multi-
worker families, typically are also multi-car families, and there has been
a continuation of the steep rise in female labor force participation in
recent years. On this basis, it seems reasonable to assume that the trend
toward multi-car ownership also continues its upward trend. In addition,
multi-car ownership might expand further because of the growing popularity
of recreational vehicles.
Growth in the Number of Households. Household formation is more
rapid than population growth at the present time. The most conservative
of the Census Bureau household projections (Series C) has an 11.9 million
increase in the number of households between 1976 and 1985. If there is
not to be a decrease in auto ownership per household, this alone implies
about a 150,000 unit annual rate of increase in unit sales (Table 1).
Changes in the composition of the population could be partly offsetting,
but available evidence suggests that the youngest household heads--the War
Babies--have more, rather than less, interest in autos. A 1972-73 survey
of expenditures indicates that households with heads aged-25 or less spent
twice as much on new automobiles as their income change would indicate.5/
CONCLUSION
Continued income growth, the strong interest in recreational
vehicles, and new household formation all point to a long-run uptrend
in new auto sales. A simple extrapolation of trend over 1953 to 1977
(Chart 2) suggests a sales pace of 11.65 units late this year. However,

Surveys of Consumer Expenditures," AEA Meetings, New York,

B- 5
several short-run considerations suggest a level of sales by year-end
which is below trend: (1) the relative price advantage of new cars
compared with other goods and services is no longer improving; (2)
the prices of used cars show signs of deteriorating relative to new cars;
(3) the debt burden of households is now at high levels; (4) consumer
attitudes towards new cars were more favorable earlier in the recovery;
and (5) the new General Motors intermediates do not appear to be gaining
public acceptance. Taking both the underlying determinants and the more
topical special factors into account, the staff now is projecting a
gradual rise in unit sales from about 10.5 million in the current quarter
to 11.0 million at year-end.
