The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

II -1
DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity appears to be expanding at a moderate
pace, but the rate of inflation remains exceptionally high. Employment
gains were again substantial in June, although they were limited to
sectors other than manufacturing. Growth in industrial production
was probably quite modest last month. Consumer purchases of durable
goods--primarily automobiles--remained robust in June, while nondurable
spending was about unchanged. The strength in plant and equipment
outlays and inventory investment appears to have been sustained in
the second quarter as a whole. Prices have continued to rise
rapidly, paced by large increases in the food component.
Employment and Production
Employment continued to increase briskly in June as nonfarm
payrolls climbed 275,000 following an upward revised rise of 230,000
in May. While these recent gains were strong, they were considerably
below the average monthly rise of nearly 450,000 during the first four
months of the year. Gains in June were concentrated in service produc-
ing industries and in contract construction. Manufacturing employ-
ment was unchanged and the factory workweek edged up .1 to 40.4 hours.
The unemployment rate dropped 0.4 percentage point in June
to 5.7 per cent--the lowest rate in nearly 4 years--as total employ-
ment measured by the household survey grew by 700,000. Over a third
of this rise was accounted for by a sharp rise in agricultural employ-
ment. Half of the drop in unemployment reflected an improved jobless

situation for teenagers, but unemployment rates among experienced
workers such as full-time workers, adult men, and job losers declined
substantially as well.
Industrial production is expected to show only a small
increase in June of around one-quarter to one-half per cent--somewhat
below the preliminary May estimate. Increases in output were
apparently balanced among products and materials. Auto assemblies
were at a 9.3 million unit seasonally adjusted annual rate in June,
as compared with 9.6 million during the April-May period; this
decline was offset by a small rise in truck production.
Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector probably
continued at 83.6 per cent in June, fractionally above the postwar
average. There is little evidence of capacity pressures in the
materials producing sector, as operating rates remain far below their
1973 highs and there is ample slack capacity abroad.
Consumer Sector Activity
Total personal income grew at an 11 per cent annual rate
in May--down somewhat from the sharp advances during the rebound
months of March and April, but in line with the average pace in 1977.
The increase in private wage and salary disbursements slowed in May,
due to the more moderate pick-up in employment and the decline in
the workweek. However, farm income increased rapidly, reflecting
sharply rising agricultural prices.

Well-maintained income growth over the past year has
supported high levels of consumer goods purchases. Total auto
sales in June continued at about the 12 million unit mark for the
fourth consecutive month with domestic sales averaging around 10
million units during this period. Consumer surveys suggest that the
sustained strength in sales has apparently been augmented by a
tendency to buy cars in advance of anticipated price increases.
Retail sales excluding autos and nonconsumer items were little changed
in June, following average monthly increases of 1 per cent in the
prior two months. In real terms, nondurable goods expenditures were
virtually unchanged in the second quarter as nominal takings were
boosted by large food price increases.
The continuing strength in durable goods sales was
consistent with consumer attitudes surveyed by the Michigan Research
Center in June. Households continued to report a step-up of
anticipatory buying patterns for large durables. This survey--like
the Conference Board survey taken at about the same time--indicates
little fundamental change in consumer attitudes over the past
2-1/2 years.
Business Investment
The book value of manufacturers' inventories increased at
a $21 billion annual rate in May, close to the large April rise.

Durable stocks grew at an $18.2 billion rate, substantially above the
advanced December to April pace. In contrast, the rate of accumu-
lation of nondurables was much reduced from the high April rate.
Despite substantial book value increases since early
this year, the ratio of inventories to sales remains low, particularly
at manufacturing establishments. The only area where any buildup is
noticeable is at the retail level, especially at furniture and
appliance stores where the book value ratio has moved above its
1974 peak.
Indicators of business capital spending continue to suggest
a more moderate rate of expansion in the second half of the year
following a sharp increase in the second quarter. New orders for
nondefense capital goods increased 4.3 per cent in May following
small declines in the previous two months. As is often the case,
the recent volatility in these bookings was due in large part to
swings in orders for transportation equipment. The machinery component,
which is more indicative of the underlying demand for capital equip-
ment, has risen at a 12 per cent annual rate so far this year, con-
siderably below the 22 per cent increase during 1977. While shipments
of nondefense capital goods fell 1.7 per cent in May, the April-
May average was almost 5 per cent above the first quarter level.

Construction contracts for private nonresidential structures
rebounded in May after dropping sharply in April. In the first five
months of the year, such contracts were almost 20 per cent above the
comparable period last year. Similarly, the value of construction
put-in-place in May was 18 per cent above the year earlier level,
although gains in the two most recent months have been successively
smaller following the weather-related rebound in March.
Residential Construction
Total private housing starts declined 5 per cent in May
to an annual rate of 2.08 million units, more than a fifth above the
weather-depressed first quarter average but slightly below the advanced
pace at the end of last year. Single-family starts edged down to just
below 1.5 million units--still quite high historically. In the multi-
family sector, starts declined 14 per cent from the April rate, which
was the highest monthly figure in over four years.
Home sales also edged down in May. Merchant builder sales
of new single-family homes were down about 1 per cent from the April
pace, while existing home sales declined 3 per cent. Sales in both
categories remained somewhat below their fourth quarter peaks.

outlays is about $452 billion, $2 billion below their March estimate.
Downward revisions were large in energy and defense spending, agricul-
tural price supports, and waste treatment and highways grants. The

Administration still estimates that revenues will total $401 billion
in the current fiscal year, and that the deficit will be $51 billion,
also $2 billion smaller than in the March Budget Update.
State and local spending increases were sizable in the
second quarter, particularly for capital spending. Construction outlays
increased 11 per cent in May--the third consecutive large rise following
the curtailed level of activity during the winter--and contracts data
suggest continued near-term strength. Employment growth also has been
quite strong in recent months despite the fact that the public employment
program (CETA) reached its funded-levels late in the spring.
Action by the California legislature to disburse the bulk
of the State's surplus will probably forestall drastic cutbacks in
spending this year. However, a moderation in expenditure growth will
undoubtedly accompany tax relief in California and elsewhere, and the
ramifications of Proposition 13 can be expected to reinforce the
generally conservative State and local government spending trend that
has been evident for the last two years.
Prices and Wages
Retail prices have increased at a 10-1/4 per cent annual
rate in recent months. Food price increases have been very large, and
prices of some nonfood items have also accelerated. Excluding food
and energy items, the consumer price index has been rising at about
an 8-1/2 per cent annual rate this year, up from a 6-1/2 per cent
rise during 1977.

II -16
The price of food at retail rose sharply again in May.
Meat, poultry, fish, and eggs prices, which had risen 4.8 per cent
(monthly) in April, were up 1.7 per cent in May. Increases were large
for other food products as well, including in particular a sizable
jump for fruits and vegetables. June developments at the producer
level suggested continued near-term pressure on retail prices; con-
sumer finished goods rose more than 1 per cent and the index of farm
prices rose by nearly 2 per cent. By mid-July, however, livestock
spot prices were below their level a month earlier.
Another major factor in the acceleration of retail prices
has been sharp increases in housing costs, which have climbed at a
10.7 per cent annual rate since December. In May, home financing,
again rose sharply and there were further large increases in natural
gas and electricity prices.
Producer prices of consumer nonfood items--often a precursor
of retail price changes--rose 0.4 per cent in June, much less than in
April and May. However, producer prices for capital equipment rose
substantially again, as manufacturers posted higher quotations for
trucks and a variety of machinery items.
Wage increases have moderated somewhat in recent months,
following the very large advances in the first quarter. In June, the
index of hourly earnings was up at a 5-1/2 per cent annual rate, and
for the second quarter as a whole, the increase was at a 7.3 per cent

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The surge in GNP in the second quarter was associated with a
pick-up in credit flows to the private nonfinancial sectors of the
economy. Much of this increase was accounted for by additional strength
in short- and intermediate-term business borrowing during the quarter--
despite a June slowdown in growth of business loans at banks. In the
household sector, mortgage financing strengthened somewhat from the
reduced first quarter pace, while consumer credit continued to expand
strongly. Fragmentary data for June, moreover, suggest little change
in the pace of home mortgage or consumer instalment borrowing. On a
seasonally adjusted basis net borrowing by the Treasury was relatively
moderate compared to the first quarter level, a pattern that was con-
tinued through June. State and local long-term borrowing increased at
about a seasonal pace, reflecting a burst of issues in May and more
moderate offerings in April and June.
The strong advance of spending in the second quarter was
also reflected in a marked acceleration of quarterly M-1 growth to a
record 9-1/2 per cent annual rate. M-2 and M-3 also expanded more
rapidly in the quarter as the faster M-1 growth more than offset slower
growth of total interest-bearing deposits included in these broader
aggregates. In June, expansion of deposits subject to regulatory
ceilings was buoyed by the introduction of the new "money market"
time certificate and to a lesser degree by the higher-yeilding eight-
year certificate.

Depository institutions in the aggregate experienced declines
in liquidity and increases in borrowing ratios during the quarter. Al-
though liquidity of other major private sectors apparently also eroded
slightly further, balance sheet positions seemed reasonably comfortable,
with the possible exception of households where debt burdens appear
substantial by historical standards.
Since the end of March, efforts by the Federal Reserve to
restrain growth in the monetary aggregates were reflected in an upward
movement in the Federal funds rate of nearly one percentage point.
This increase was accompanied by advances in other short-term rates of
from 75 to 135 basis points. Since the June FOMC meeting, most money
market interest rates have risen 15 to 25 basis points, largely in
response to the quarter point increase in the funds rate to 7-3/4 per
cent, though the three-month Treasury bill rate--which had increased
relatively little early in the quarter--went up by 45 basis points. In
addition, the prime rate increased a quarter point to 9 per cent. While
rates in intermediate- and longer-term credit markets generally advanced
by somewhat less than short-term rates over the quarter, during the
intermeeting period they rose about as much as short-term rates.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Following a 13-1/2 per cent average growth rate over April
and May, M-1 expansion in June slowed to a moderate 5-1/2 per cent as
an usually large mid-month rise in Treasury deposit balances may have

restrained growth temporarily. The rapid M-1 growth over the second
quarter as a whole, however, was well below that of nominal GNP, and
the estimated rate of increase of M-1 velocity of 7-3/4 per cent was
the largest since early 1976. The large growth in velocity apparently
reflected the usual lag before money demand adjusts fully to abrupt
changes in GNP. Since the spring of last year, quarterly M-1 growth
has been consistent with the historical relationship among money
demand, GNP, and short-term interest rates.
Though M-2 expanded somewhat faster in the second quarter
than in the first, the advance in its interest-bearing component (line
5 of the Monetary Aggregate table) moderated due to a slackening in the
growth of large time deposits included in this aggregate (line 11).
In contrast, growth in bank deposits subject to rate ceilings (line
12) picked up, despite the increases in market interest rates over the
quarter. This pick-up may have reflected the introduction in June of
the new six-month--and to a lesser extent the eight-year--accounts,
both of which offer a more competitive rate of return (Chart 1).
While savings deposit inflows at banks declined from the already slow
pace of the preceding quarter, growth of small-denomination time
deposits (line 10) in the second quarter rose by 4-1/2 percentage points
to a 10-1/2 per cent annual rate. Growth of small time deposits rose
to a 15-1/2 per cent rate in June.

Board staff estimates shown in the table on page III-7 indicate
that $780 million of the newly authorized six-month certificates were
issued at commercial banks during the first week of June (latest avail-
able data).1/ Some of these funds apparently were drawn from other
accounts at banks--as indicated by the net outflow from savings deposits
of individuals in June for the first time since August 1973. However,
banks likely retained some funds that would otherwise have been diverted
to market instruments. On balance, growth of small time and savings
deposits (line 12) was sustained at about the 5-1/2 per cent rate of
the previous month, despite the further increases in market rates.
Other survey results indicate that the six-month certificate
thus far has attracted a sizable volume of deposits at thrift institu-
tions.2/ Tentative estimates indicate that the outstanding volume of
money market certificates was around $3.4 billion at S&Ls as of June 21
and $1.7 billion at MSBs as of June 28, representing roughly 1 to 1-1/2
per cent of total thrift deposits. Respondents at large S&Ls estimated
that about 40 to 45 per cent of their sales represented new funds,
1/ About 45 per cent of banks, mainly large institutions, offered the
new certificate, with the preponderance of offering banks paying
the maximum allowable rate of interest. Sales of the newly-
authorized eight-year certificates have reportedly been much more
sluggish. Preliminary data are available only for MSBs where an
estimated $275 million of the long-term certificates were issued
by the end of June. MSBs surveyed estimated that somewhat less
than half of these sales represented new funds.
2/ It is estimated that about 60 to 70 per cent of MSBs and roughly
90 per cent of S&Ls offered the money market certificate; nearly
all institutions offering the certificate paid the ceiling rate.

IIl -9
while at MSBs the figure was put at 30 per cent.1/ These inflows,
together with a diminution of funds withdrawn, likely accounted for
the strengthening in thrift deposit growth in June relative to May by
2 percentage points for S&Ls and three-quarters of a percentage point
for MSBs. Nevertheless, in the face of upward movements in interest
rates, the second-quarter growth rates at S&Ls and MSBs of 7-3/4 and
3-1/2 per cent, respectively, were weaker than the significantly
reduced first quarter pace. Concomitantly, alternative short-term
investment outlets for small savers, such as money market mutual fund
shares and non-competitive tenders for Treasury bills, attracted
sizable funds over the quarter but in somewhat smaller amounts in
June
Growth in total loans and investments at commercial banks
increased to a rapid 13-1/2 per cent annual rate in the second quarter.
Also representing a pick-up over the first quarter, the growth in total
loans matched the 15-1/2 per cent average rate over the past 12 months,
despite a marked slowdown in June. The June slowing was largely due
to a sharp decrease in the pace of business lending following rapid
April growth and an extraordinary surge in May. Real estate and con-
sumer loans also added considerable strength to total loans over the
1/ These estimates may overstate the amount of new funds at the
institutions collectively since inter-institutional transfers of
funds are not accounted for. On the other hand, new funds may
have been understated to the extent that the apparently temporary
buildup of funds in passbook accounts in May, following the
announcement of the new certificate, represented new funds but
were not so reported when transferred to the certificate in June.

second quarter as they have for over a year. Bank holdings of Treasury
securities increased somewhat--both at large and small banks--representing
the first quarterly expansion since the second quarter of last year.
As inflows of deposits subject to rate ceilings did not keep
pace with the surge in bank credit, managed liabilities increased over
the second quarter, albeit at a slower rate than in the first.1/ The
ratio of managed liabilities to total assets at large banks rose
further during the quarter to a level not much below the 1974 peak
(Chart 2). In addition, since late 1977 these banks have reduced the
share of their assets invested in liquid form, although liquidity
positions generally remain comfortable relative to 1974. While the
increase in the borrowing ratio and accompanying decline in the liquidity
ratio do not appear at the present time to pose any serious problems
for the banking system as a whole, they may portend further tightening
of credit terms to borrowers.
Business Finance
Business short- and intermediate-term borrowing in the second
quarter was the largest in four years. Business loans net of bankers
acceptances rose at a 20 per cent annual rate--the most rapid expansion
since the second quarter of 1974--with the remarkable surge in business
loans in May offsetting the marked slowing in June. These monthly
fluctuations were concentrated at large banks. At the very large banks--
which had reported widespread strength by industry category in May--most

their net lending to banking offices abroad--particularly to

industries showed relative weakness in June, with loans to public
utilities and commodity dealers contracting sharply.
During the second quarter of 1978, nonfinancial commercial
paper showed more rapid growth than in any quarter since the third
quarter of 1974.1/ The largest monthly seasonally adjusted issuance
occurred in June, although the not seasonally adjusted volume was
smaller. The introduction of a new financing program for a large rural
electrification cooperative accounted for over $300 million of the
estimated $800 million seasonally adjusted increase in June. Business
credit at finance companies expanded in April and May at about the
pace of the first quarter. Retail financing of both commercial vehicles
and business, industrial,and farm equipment registered large gains.
The second quarter's average monthly volume of gross public
offering of corporate bonds rose to $1.8 billion (NSA), an amount
larger than in the first quarter but still below last year's average
monthly volume. Public offerings in June were about equal to the
second quarter's average pace as an increased volume of utility issues
more than offset reduced offerings by industrial corporations and
financial concerns. The light volume of publicly offered corporate
bonds in recent months can be attributed largely to the relatively
1/ Total commercial paper outstanding increased by a record amount
during the second quarter of 1978 with nonbank-related financial
firms accounting for over half of the increase. Much of this growth
arose from the financing needs of the auto-related finance companies.
Bank-related paper also contributed significantly to the quarterly
growth.

small amount of nonfinancial offerings, especially large, higher-rated
industrial issues. In contrast, public bond offerings by finance
companies and other financial concerns have remained quite sizable.
The external financing requirements of nonfinancial corpora-
tions have been very large this year and the reduction in their public
bond offerings has been accompanied by heavier reliance on shorter-term
credit and limited acquisitions of liquid assets. As a result, corpor-
ate liquidity (as measured by the ratio of liquid assets to short-term
liabilities) has moved lower, although the current level remains well
above its record 1974 low (Chart 3).
Corporate bond yields have moved higher since March, and by
early July the Board's index of newly issued, Aaa-rated utility bonds
had registered its highest reading since late 1975. Coincident with the
25 basis point rise in corporate bond yields in the intermeeting period,
stock prices generally edged lower. Nevertheless, most major indexes,
reflecting strong April-May gains, currently exceed the levels at the
end of the first quarter by 8 to 14 per cent.
Government Finance
The 50 to 75 basis point increases in Treasury bill rates over
the second quarter were moderate compared to the rise in the Federal
funds rate and other short-term rates. A relative scarcity of bills
apparently helped to limit the upward movements of bill rates during
the quarter. Over the quarter, the Treasury paid down $5.9 billion in
bills. Moreover, the System acquired $4.6 billion for its own account,

over the April-June period, thus more than offsetting a $3.1 billion
reduction of foreign official holdings which occurred despite a con-
tinued sizable deficit in the U.S. current account. After mid-June, the
Treasury redeemed the $6.0 billion of cash management bills issued in
early June, though it raised $500 million of new money in the one-year
bill auction toward month end. In addition, Desk acquisitions of bills
for System and foreign accounts over this period totaled nearly $3.9
billion.
In the Treasury coupon area, yields rose 35 to 70 basis
points over the second quarter, with increases in longer term yields
of around 20 basis points occurring since the last FOMC meeting. The
second quarter increases in coupon rates were progressively smaller the
longer the maturity of the security, and the Treasury yield curve
beyond one year flattened significantly further. Unlike the rises in
bill rates, the increases in coupon yields since March were generally
in line with rises in yields on private securities of comparable
maturities. Over the quarter, the Treasury raised $7.0 billion of
new money through coupon issues and about $2.8 billion since the June
FOMC meeting. Though sponsored agancies raised only $1.5 billion in
June, they raised $6.2 billion during the quarter--with the FHLB System
and FNMA accounting for $5.1 billion.1/
The substantial volume of gross tax-exempt bond offerings in
the second quarter in part reflected a surge in advance refundings prior

to the mid-May effective date of an IRS ruling restricting certain
types of issues. While representing a substantial decline from May's
volume, June bond offerings remained relatively strong at $4.1 billion,
due largely to the takedown of $565 million in New York City securities
by city pension funds at month's end.1/
Continuing an upward movement that has developed over the
past three months, yields on municipal securities have increased about
15 basis points since the last FOMC meeting. Effects of the recent
passage of Proposition 13 (the Jarvis-Gann Initiative) appear to have
been confined to certain obligations of California localities which
finance less-essential services and are most dependent on property tax
revenues and assessments. Interest rates on such obligations have ad-
justed upward by an estimated quarter to one percentage point as a
2/result of the passage of the Initiative.2/
Mortgage Markets
Net mortgage lending in June appeared to hold near the pace
of the first two months of the quarter. During the quarter, stepped-up
net lending by commercial banks and greater support from secondary
market institutions such as FNMA evidently more than offset reduced
mortgage lending at S&Ls and MSBs. Thus, the second quarter total was
apparently somewhat larger than the weather-depressed first quarter, but
1/ Only about $300 million of gross offerings in June were bonds sold
to refund previously-issued obligations, in contrast to a record $2.2
billion of refunding issues in May and $975 million in April.
2/ Proposition 13 has not affected secondary market trading of general
obligations of the State of California. A clearer test of the impact
of Proposition 13 may occur on August 15 when the State has scheduled
its next debt issue. Meanwhile, the Initiative faces many court
challenges to its constitutionality and its applicability to various
types of outstanding municipal debt.

III -20
still more than 10 per cent below the peak rate registered in the final
quarter of last year.
For S&Ls--still the largest single source of residential
mortgage credit--mortgage commitments outstanding declined in May for
the fifth consecutive month. By the end of May, S&L commitments out-
standing were about 8 per cent below their peak of more than $34
billion in December 1977 (Chart 4, top panel). The ratio of these
commitments at insured S&Ls relative to prospective three-month cash
flow was 1.40 at the end of May--still relatively high by historical
standards, but below a three-year peak of 1.72 at year-end 1977 (Chart
4, bottom panel).
In early July, mortgage funds continued to be reported in
short supply at about two-thirds of a sample of S&Ls surveyed by FHLMC,
sharply above the proportion at the end of the first quarter. With
deposit growth remaining relatively weak in the second quarter, S&Ls
continued to rely heavily upon FHLB advances and other sources of
borrowing to help sustain mortgage lending; borrowing by S&Ls as a per
cent of total assets is approaching 1974 highs (Chart 5). In addition,
after declining for three quarters, the liquidity ratio at insured
S&Ls--as measured by cash and liquid assets as a percentage of deposits
plus short-term borrowings--was 8.3 per cent, seasonally adjusted, only
0.7 of a percentage point above its trough in the third quarter of 1974.1/
1/ The minimum required liquidity ratio, set by the FHLBB, now stands
at 6.5 per cent. In recent years the aggregate liquidity ratio at
S&Ls has remained at least 1.5 per cent above the requirement, and
the FHLBB has typically lowered the requirement when that level has
been approached. In addition, FHLBB policies have not slowed the
growth of advances; thus far in July advances have risen by $500
illion.

Average interest rates on new commitments for 80 per cent
conventional home mortgages at sampled S&Ls have remained around 9-3/4
per cent during the recent intermeeting period, nearly 50 basis points
higher than at the end of March. Yields in secondary mortgage markets
rose somewhat further in the week following the last FOMC meeting. To
bring FHA/VA rates more closely in line with the market, the Administra-
tion again raised the ceiling rate on both mome and project mortgages,
this time to 9-1/2 per cent, effective June 28.1/ By the FNMA auction
of July 10, yields had edged still higher.
Consumer Finance
The stronger expansion of consumer instalment credit outstand-
ing which had begun in March persisted into the second quarter, with the
20 per cent annual rate of growth over April and May moderately above
the first quarter's pace. The major stimulus to accelerated growth
has continued to be auto credit, which has increased despite a sustained
rise in average monthly payments on new-auto contracts at finance
companies and commercial banks (based on information through early 1978).
Measures of household debt burdens generally increased in the
second quarter. Relative to disposable personal income the stock of
outstanding debt--including both consumer and home mortgage loans--rose
to a new high of 66 per cent. The net flow of home mortgage and con-
sumer credit also edged higher relative to disposable income during the
1/ The 50 basis point upward adjustment in the FHA/VA contract interest
rate reduced required discounts on home mortgages by more than 3
points. In the July 10 FNMA auction, discounts on home loans bear-
ing the higher rate averaged 3.5 points.

second quarter, following an unusually sharp drop in the first quarter
which has been attributed largely to weather-reduced mortgage borrowing.
By contrast, the ratio of loan repayments to disposable income--an
indicator of near-term debt-servicing burden--remained essentially
unchanged in the second quarter, at a level slightly below the high in
the last quarter of 1977. Meanwhile, the liquidity of the household
sector balance sheet has eroded somewhat, since the uptrend in total
assets in recent quarters has been fueled primarily by sharply expanding
values of homes while growth of financial assets has lagged.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. The dollar remained under periodic
heavy selling pressure on exchange markets over the past month. In the
four weeks since the last green book the average exchange value of the
dollar dropped by over 2 per cent, bringing the dollar's cumulative decline
since the resumption of downward pressure in late May to over 3-1/2 per
cent. The dollar has fallen to its lowest point so far this year and is
nearly 9 per cent below its level of last September.
The recent strong selling pressure on the dollar apparently
reflects heightened market concern over the expected high U.S. inflation
rate and large U.S. payments deficits at a time when inflation abroad has
declined and the large current account surpluses of Japan and Germany con-
tinue unabated. Pressure on the dollar intensified in reaction to the
July 6-7 conference of Common Market heads of government in Bremen with
its focus on developing closer monetary cooperation in Europe and from
expectations that the July 16-17 Bonn summit conference will fail to achieve
agreement on measures which might reverse the recent downtrend of dollar
exchange rates.
.The Desk sold small amounts of marks from System and Treasury

balances on several occasions over the past month when the dollar was
depreciating sharply. The Desk also made intervention sales of $18 million
equivalent of Swiss francs, financed by swap drawings by the System on
the Swiss National Bank. At other times during the period, however, the
Desk purchased substantial amounts of marks
and over the past four weeks the Desk made net purchases of $370 million
equivalent of marks on behalf of the System and the Treasury. These pur-
chases enabled the System to repay nearly $220 million equivalent of swap
drawings on the Bundesbank, reducing outstanding System mark swap drawings
to $910 million equivalent. Treasury swap repayments to the Bundesbank of
$150 million equivalent during the period reduced outstanding Treasury swap
obligations to $380 million equivalent.
The recent general rise of foreign currencies against the dollar
has been led by the sharp appreciation of the Japanese yen. The yen rose
by over 6 per cent against the dollar over the past month, and has risen
by nearly 13 per cent since late May. This strong demand for yen reflects
the mounting evidence that the Japanese current account surplus this year
will substantially exceed last year's $11 billion surplus.
The approach of the Bremen meeting in early July generated specu-
lation that some or all of the traditionally weaker European Community
currencies -- the French franc, the British pound and the Italian lira --
might be included in an expanded European currency band, and this speculation
led to an increased exchange market demand for these currencies. The French

IV -4
franc and pound appreciated by 3 per cent against the dollar and rose
slightly relative to the existing snake currencies. The lira moved up
by nearly 2 per cent against the dollar.
At the conclusion of the Bremen conference, EC leaders agreed to study
and work toward implementing a new European monetary arrangement, apparently
involving grouping the present joint float currencies in a narrower fluc-
tuation band, adding new members to the band -- possibly with initially
wider fluctuation limits -- and some pooling of reserves.
The German mark and other snake currencies rose by about 2 per
cent against the dollar over the past month.
.The Belgian franc trailed the mark
in its rise against the dollar, and the franc moved to its lower limit
against the mark within the existing snake,

OPEC surpluses and investment flows. New external investments
by OPEC countries so far in 1978 have been at a greatly reduced rate
compared with either the first half of 1977 or any period in the years
1974-76. The OPEC investible surplus has been declining rapidly since
mid-1977 as OPEC imports have continued to rise while oil revenues first
stabilized and then declined in reflection of a variety of factors. For
1978 as a whole the surplus may be reduced by about 50 per cent from the
1977 figure of $37 billion.
The OPEC investible surplus (current account adjusted for
credit to oil companies) is estimated to have decreased from a high
level of around $24-1/2 billion in the first half of 1977 to about
$12-1/2 billion in the second half (see table). Oil export receipts in
the second half of 1977 were approximately unchanged while imports rose
15 per cent to a level 40 per cent above a year earlier; the deficit on
services also widened. In addition to these changes, OPEC grant aid
was somewhat larger in the second half, and OPEC countries resumed mak-
ing net credits to oil companies in the second half after effectively
receiving net repayments in the first half when lags in export receipts
were shortened.
For the year 1978 the investible surplus is expected to be in
the range of $15-20 billion. Oil exports have actually declined in
early 1978 because of weak demand, a running down of inventories in
consuming countries, increased oil supplies from non-OPEC countries and
the absence of a price increase by OPEC. First-quarter oil receipts
were down 10 per cent from a year earlier. While a pick-up is expected

in the second half, oil export receipts for 1978 as a whole are pro-
jected to be about 3 per cent, or $4-5 billion, less than in 1977.
After rising 22 per cent last year the dollar value of OPEC imports is
conservatively expected to increase 15 per cent ($12 billion) this year,
partly in reflection of the depreciation of the dollar. The expected
rise in imports reflects, inter alia, Saudi Arabia's willingness to ab-
sorb the entire drop in total OPEC oil sales. The services deficit
should also widen further. The 1978 investible surplus projections by
the staff and the estimates for 1976-77 are as follows (in billions of
dollars):

Grant aid -4 -4-1/2 -4
Credit to oil companies -7-1/2 3 0
Investible surplus 29-1/2 37 17
In the first quarter of 1978 the current account surplus (excluding
grants and credit to oil companies) may have been about $7 billion, with
the investible surplus higher at $9 billion as falling oil sales caused
net reductions in credit to oil companies. Known or estimated investment
flows in the first quarter totaled $4.6 billion; the decrease in these
flows from rates observed in the first half of 1977 was somewhat less
pronounced than the drop in the investible surplus itself. First-quarter
inflows to the United States and the United Kingdom were about two-thirds
the average quarterly rate in the first half of last year (with longer-
term investments down the most) while the inflow to the Euro-currency
market was about one-half as much (although still the largest flow).

U.S. International transactions. The U.S. merchandise trade
deficit was $31.7 billion (annual rate) in May (see Chart 1) and $34.6
billion in April- May combined, down substantially from the very high
[$44.8 billion] annual rate recorded in the first quarter. The deficit
declined as exports rose strongly for the first time in more than a year
and the growth in imports slowed somewhat

Holdings of foreign official assets in the United States,
including those of both OPEC and non-OPEC countries, declined in April-
May for the first time in over a year. This shift was offset in part
by an increased net inflow of private bank-reported and securities
transactions.
Date were released at the end of June for the first quarter
U.S current account balance. The numbers showed a deficit of $27.8
billion (annual rate) compared with $15.2 billion for 1977. These data
were revised to include reinvested earnings of incorporated affiliates
as investment income flows. This revision is described in detail in
ppendix A.
U.S. merchandise trade. Total exports were up by 13 per cent
in April-May, with nonagricultural shipments up by 10 per cent and
agricultural shipments up by more than 20 per cent over first quarter
rates. The growth in total exports was largely in terms of volume;
the nonagricultural export unit value index was about unchanged and that
for agricultural exports rose by 6 per cent. The total export increase
was broadly based across geographical regions. Exports to developing
countries (including oil exporters) continued their rapid pace of
earlier this year, while those to industrial countries picked up
after having declined since mid-1977.

NOTE: Details may not add to totals because of rounding.
Among nonagricultural commodities, shipments of coal in
April-May were more than triple their strike-depressed levels in the
first quarter, though they were still below last year's average rate.
Exports of aircraft and nonferrous metals were up by more than 20
per cent, while consumer goods advanced by 15 per cent and machinery
and automotive vehicles by 10 per cent each.
An exceptionally rapid growth in agricultural exports during
April-May was led by very large shipments of the major export crops,
soybeans, corn and (to a lesser extent) wheat. Some pickup in these
exports had been anticipated in the second quarter because weather
and strike-related transportation difficulties in previous months
had caused shipments to fall behind schedule relative to total sales
for the current marketing year. The large size of the April-May
increase exceeded expectations, however. Supplies in other major

IV -12
exporting regions have been relatively tight due to drought-reduced
production in the Southern Hemisphere, while the United States has
had a more than ample stock position. At the same time, increased
livestock numbers, particularly in Western Europe and the Soviet
Bloc, have strengthened foreign demand for grain and soybeans for
feed. The recent dollar depreciation also may have stimulated some
demand, although shipments to Japan (whose currency has risen the
fastest against the dollar) grew only moderately.
Total imports declined in May after rising strongly in April.
For April-May combined they were up by 3-1/2 per cent over the first
quarter. Most of the movement in total imports reflected sharp
fluctuations in petroleum imports, as nonpetroleum imports were
relatively stable on average. The volume of oil imports in April-May
was 10 per cent above the first quarter rate when domestic stocks
were being run down from the high levels accumulated last year.
Steel imports declined sharply in May when the Treasury's trigger
price mechanism went into full effect. However, the decline was
apparently not as great as steel industry exports had expected.
Coffee imports also dropped sharply, in terms of both price and
volume, for the second consecutive month. These declines were off-
set by moderate increases in most other categories of nonpetroleum
imports.

IV -13
Foreign official assets in the United States (excluding
OPEC holdings) were about unchanged in May, rising by only $0.2
billion, after having fallen by $3.0 billion in April.
Based on preliminary data, these foreign official assets
are estimated to have remained little changed in June. This would
imply roughly a $2.5 billion decline in holdings for the second
quarter, a significant reversal of the large scale increased over
the past year.
.Official inflows resumed in early July, however, with the
renewed downward pressure on the dollar.
OPEC banking and security holdings in the United States
fell by $0.8 billion in May, following a $1.2 billion decline in
April. Together with preliminary data for June, these holdings are
estimated to have declined by more than $2 billion in the second
quarter, following sizable increases over the past year. The recent

IV -14
decline in OPEC holdings may be related, in part, to the reduced
OPEC current account surplus.(see section on OPEC investment
flows above).
The shift to a net outflow of officially held funds was offset
by a sizable net private capital inflow. Bank-reported private capital
transactions (adjusted for reporting bias) showed a small net outflow
in May, but amounted to a $4.5 billion inflow for April-May combined.
Most of this inflow reflected transfers from foreign affiliates of U.S.
banks.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks
were $350 million in May, and $950 million for April-May combined,
up substantially from the rate during the previous six months. U.S.
purchases of foreign securities fell to $50 million in May and
$400 million in April-May combined, about half the average rate
over the past year. However, foreign placements in the U.S. bond
market have not slowed as much as the decline in U.S. purchases.
An increasing share of foreign placements in the U.S. market has been
purchased by foreign residents.

IV -15
Foreign Economic Developments. The continuation of extremely
large current-account surpluses in Japan and Germany has been the domin-
ant international development over the past month. The pace of economic
activity and the movement of prices in the six major foreign industrial
countries have proceeded as generally expected, although recent data for
Germany has revealed surprising weakness. These developments are likely
to be among the principal topics of discussion at the Bonn Summit later
this month.
The May current-account surplus (s.a.) in Japan was somewhat
higher than the April figure, bringing the cumulative current-account
surplus through the first five months of this year to over $8 billion.
The performance so far this year, together with further J-curve effects
from continued appreciation of the yen, makes it extremely unlikely that
the Japanese current-account surplus for 1978 -- in dollar terms -- can
be reduced from last year's $11 billion figure. In Germany, the cumu-
lative current-account surplus (n.s.a.) through May has already reached
$2.7 billion, and is virtually certain to surpass the $3.9 billion
surplus for all of last year. The external accounts of Italy and France
have also shown surprising strength in recent months.
In Germany and Japan it still appears that real GNP growth is
likely to fall short of official targets. In Germany, real GNP growth
in the first quarter of 1978 was basically flat and was marked by a
nearly 1 per cent (s.a.) decline in fixed investment. Both industrial
production and new orders decreased in ay, although both series tend
to be quite erratic. In Japan, private consumption appears to have

IV -16
strengthened somewhat in recent months, and industrial production has
continued to rise (although rather slowly), due in large part to in-
creased government expenditure. There are no indications yet, however,
of an incipient recovery of private investment.
The economies of the United Kingdom and Italy are continuing
on an expansionary path. Cn the basis of provisional figures, GDP in
the United Kingdom rose by about 1/2 per cent in the first quarter, led
by a 2 per cent increase in private consumption expenditure. Industrial
production in the United Kingdom has also continued to expand through
April. The recovery in Italy is now proceeding at a pace at which real
growth may exceed 2-1/2 per cent in 1978, with strength coming from a
growing public-sector deficit. Real growth in Canada is continuing at
a modest rate, but private investment is at an extremely low level.
Moderation of rates of increase in consumer prices has con-
tinued in most of the six major foreign industrial countries. An
exception is France where the upward trend in consumer prices has
accelerated sharply to double-digit rates in recent months. Although
the French government is committed to restraint on wage increases,
high rates of inflation are expected to continue, at least through
this quarter, as the economy adjusts to increases in public-sector
tariffs and to the phasing out of industrial price controls. In
Italy, there is concern that the growing public-sector deficit,
together with stronger activity and a more rapid growth of monetary
aggregates, may intensify the still high rate of inflation. In the
United Kingdom, recent large money supply increases and accelerating unit
wage costs have raised fears of a new inflationary surge later in the year.

Notes on Individual Countries. The increase in the Japanese
current-account surplus to $1.4 billion (s.a.) in May has pushed the
cumulative surplus for the first five months of 1978 over $8 billion.
It is estimated that the May surplus would have been even higher were
it not for a substantial volume of accelerated oil imports induced by
the June 1 imposition of a special oil tax. Preliminary trade figures
for June indicate that the current-account was strongly positive in
that month as well. Industrial production in Japan advanced in May for
the seventh consecutive month. Since October of last year the index of
industrial production has increased at an annual rate of slightly below
12 per cent but increases in April and May have been small. Household
consumption appears to have strengthened somewhat in recent months, but
no clear indications of a sustained recovery of private investment have
yet emerged. Excess capacity is still at a high level, and no progress
has been made in reducing unemployment.
Through May the German current-account surplus has already
reached $2.7 billion (n.s.a.); the deficit in the services account in
particular was considerably below its level for the same five months a
year ago. First-quarter German national accounts reveal that strong
contributions to real growth from private and government consumption
were almost completely offset by declines in fixed investment and net
exports. The weak performance of GNP in the first quarter makes it
likely that real growth will fall below 3 per cent in 1978. The cen-
tral government budget appears to be on track, but state and local
deficits (which were budgeted to grow by DM10 billion this year) were
running below their 1977 levels in the first quarter. A number of

IV -21
proposals for stimulating domestic demand -- including public investment
spending, tax cuts, and increased social welfare payments -- are being
discussed within the German Cabinet, and some announcement appears likely
following the July 16-17 Bonn Summit.
The recovery in activity in Italy appears to be progressing
at a modest pace. However, the failure until now of the authorities to
adopt measures that would reduce the enlarged-public-sector deficit to
the government's announced 24-25 trillion lire target, and the strong
chance that the deficit will surpass the target by a substantial margin,
may produce a stronger growth of GDP in 1978 than the 2-1/2 per cent that
was expected on the basis of the lower deficit. A large public-sector
deficit, which would probably be financed primarily by the central bank,
also would lead to a faster expansion of monetary aggregates; higher
monetary growth and stronger activity probably would intensify a still
high rate of inflation. Although stronger activity and higher inflation
in time would reduce or eliminate the current-account surplus, at present
the external situation is strong, in part because of a good tourist season.
In the United Kingdom a consumption-led expansion in economic
activity is under way. Provisional figures show that real GDP rose 1/2
per cent (s.a.) in the first quarter of 1978. In the same period real
consumer expenditures increased by some 2 per cent. Also, recently
revised data indicate that for the first 5 months of 1978, the British
current account recorded a slight deficit. Most forecasts continue to
show a current-account surplus for 1978,but its expected size has been
reduced considerably.

IV -22
Canadian real GNP increased by 0.7 (s.a.) per cent in the first
quarter of 1978 following a revised increase of 1.5 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1977. Strong contributions were made by consump-
tion expenditure and net exports. Fixed investment continued to be
the major source of weakness in the economy; real business capital
formation was at its lowest level in three years in the first quarter.
Further strength in consumer spending during the second quarter of
this year is indicated by recent new orders data while investment
spending is expected to continue to be weak due to low capacity utili-
zation. Consumer prices rose by 1.3 per cent during May, reflecting
continued large increases in the price of food. Increases in non-food
consumer prices -- i.e., the prices of those items that had been sub-
ject to the wage and price control program -- continued to moderate.
In France consumer prices rose at an average annual rate of
over 12 per cent during the three months to May, representing a sub-
stantial acceleration of inflation over the previous three-month period.
Double-digit rates of price increases are expected to continue for at
least the next few months as the economy continues to adjust to public-
sector price increases and the phasing out of industrial price controls.
Underlying cost pressures, however, have not shown clear signs of inten-
sifying; the rate of increase in nominal wages in fact continued to
decelerate in the first quarter. A recently announced increase of 3.8
per cent in the minimum wage, effective July 1, is not expected to com-
promise seriously government efforts to continue to reduce the average
rate of wage increases in the economy. The trade balance remained in

IV -23
small surplus in Lay. Imports are expected to increase further in
coming months, however, so that a shift back towards deficit would
seem likely.
In the Netherlands another 1 billion guilder rise in the
projected 1978 budget deficit has prompted a series of economy mea-
sures that will reduce the rate of growth of government expenditures
over the next three years. Even after these cuts, however, the Dutch
authorities project that the budget still will exert an increasingly
expansionary influence on the economy and reduce somewhat the rate of
unemployment. In May, Sweden experienced its fourth consecutive monthly
trade surplus together with decelerating consumer price inflation, indi-
cating some success on the two major policy fronts.
Monetary and financial developments abroad. The general
decline in short-term interest rates observed abroad last year and
early this year came to an end in the second quarter (see Table).
Interest rates have risen (or, at least, have stopped declining) in
all the major countries -- except France -- since March, although
only in Britain have they risen as much as in the United States.
The reversal of the downward trend of short-term interest
rates seems to reflect two factors. First, declines in inflation rates
also observed last year seem to be coming to an end; indeed, especially
in Italy and the United Kingdom (and in France, where interest rates
have declined this year but were relatively high at the end of last
year), there is concern about accelerating inflation rates. Second,
growth rates of the monetary aggregates in Germany, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom so far this year (see Table) suggest that target

growth rates may be exceeded. Consequently, monetary authorities --
especially in Britain -- have acted to raise interest rates to slow
money growth.
The increase in interest rates in Canada reflects different
considerations. Specifically, it reflects concern on the part of
Canadian authorities about the decline in the exchange value of the
Canadian dollar and, correspondingly, actions to keep Canadian rates
in line with U.S. rates.
The trend of long-term bond yields since March has been mixed.
The most significant movements have been (1) the sharp increase in yields
in Britain, which reflects again the expectation of accelerating infla-
tion and official actions to slow money growth; and (2) the increase in
yields in Germany, which is significant because it has taken place in
spite of unchanged inflation rates and unexpectedly weak economic acti-
vity (and may reflect some concern about the financing of the public-
sector deficit).

APPENDIX A*
INCLUSION OF REINVESTED EARNINGS IN U.S.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS STATISTICS
The presentation of the summary of U.S. international
transactions has been revised back to 1960 to include reinvested
earnings of incorporated affiliates. These earnings are incorporated
in both the current account (in direct investment income receipts
and payments) and in private capital flows (in U.S. direct invest-
ment abroad and in foreign direct investment in the United States).
The effect of this addition is to increase recorded U.S. net income
receipts (thus reducing the level of the current-account deficit),
and to increase the amount of direct investment capital flows
recorded each quarter (thus increasing net capital outflows from the
United States.) For the most part, inclusion of reinvested earnings
adjusts the levels but not the quarter-to-quarter changes of the
accounts. Table 1 summarizes the effects of this revision. Chart 1
shows the current account balance on both the old and new bases.
At present, reinvested earnings will not be included in the GNP
account (net exports); they will be added during the next GNP bench-
mark revision (perhaps in 1979 or 1980).
The inclusion of reinvested earnings in direct investment
income recognizes that a direct investor's share in the total
earnings of an incorporated affiliate (net of the affiliate's
income taxes and withholding taxes on dividends) is income to the
direct investor, whether or not it is repatriated. The counter-
part entry in the capital account ofthese reinvested income flows
appears as changes in U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign
direct investment in the United States.
Until now, reinvested earnings have been reported as
memoranda items in table 5 in the quarterly U.S. International
Transactions articles in the Survey of Current Business. Because
reports of earnings are not as complete as for other direct-
investment related items the data were published with a one quarter
lag. Data for the current quarter are now published on an estimated
basis.

Transactions Section, Division of International Finance

Inclusion of reinvested earnings in the quarterly U.S.
international transactions figures follows the recommendation
made in the Report of the Advisory Committee on the Presentation
of the Balance of Payments Statistics (May, 1976), and also
conforms with recommendations by the IMF.1
/ At present, in addition to the United States, three other large
industrial countries (Germany, the United Kingdom, and France) report
undistributed direct investment income flows in their balance-of-
payments compilations. Data reported by these countries, however,
appear to understate seriously such flows.
