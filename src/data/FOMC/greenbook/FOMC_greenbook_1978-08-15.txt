The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate
pace since the second-quarter surge in growth. Employment and
industrial production rose further in July, and consumer spending
on nonauto goods picked up. In addition, housing starts were again
at an advanced level in June and spending for private nonresidential
construction increased markedly. Overall prices have risen rapidly
so far this year.
Employment and Production
Nonfarm payroll employment, as measured by the survey of
establishments, rose 265,000 in July--about two-thirds of the average
monthly increase during the first half of the year. Much of the gain
was in trade and service industries. Employment in contract construction
registered another large increase in July to a level half a million
above six months earlier. In the manufacturing sector, employment
rose by 25,000 for the second successive month--with recent gains
concentrated in machinery industries--while the factory workweek
remained at 40.4 hours.
The household survey, on the other hand, indicated a decline
of more than 300,000 in nonagricultural employment along with a large
decrease in farm jobs. The drop in total employment followed an
exceptionally large increase of 700,000 in June. Monthly changes in
employment, as measured by the household and establishment surveys,
have sometimes diverged and the disparity in recent months is not

unprecedented. When viewed over a longer time span, the two surveys
generally have shown similar changes. Over the last twelve months
for example, both measures show nonfarm employment rising about 3-1/2
million. Reflecting the sharp movement reported for total employment,
the unemployment rate moved up 0.5 percentage point to 6.2 per cent
in July, after falling 0.4 percentage point in the preceding month.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, imperfect seasonal
adjustment factors appear to have exaggerated the improvement in June
and, consequently, the deterioration in July.
Reflecting the continued gains in payroll employment and other
data, industrial production is tentatively estimated to have increased
about one-half per cent in July, up from the June rise initially
estimated at 0.3 per cent. Since November--prior to the beginning
of the coal strike--monthly increases in the industrial production
index averaged close to 0.5 per cent, compared with an average gain
of 0.4 per cent in the preceding 12 months. Increases in July were
widespread among most products and materials. Output of durable
consumer goods rose further reflecting gains in auto and home goods,
such as appliances and furniture. Auto assemblies--at a 9.4 million
unit annual rate in July--were up fractionally from the June rate;
truck production was about unchanged. Business equipment production
continued to show strength, and raw steel output increased again in
July.

II -4
Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector as a whole
apparently edged up to about 84 per cent in July, approximately
1-1/2 percentage points above the average rate since 1967. In the
materials-producing industries, operating rates are close to the long-
run average but remain far below their 1973 highs. Utilization rates
in the steel industry have risen sharply since the low levels of last
winter, but industry sources do not expect capacity pressures this
year.
Consumer Sector Activity
Weekly data suggest retail sales excluding autos and nonconsumer
items increased more than one per cent in July, after showing little
change in June. (Advance monthly data for July should be available for
the Greenbook supplement.) Substantial gains were indicated at both
durable and nondurable stores. However, total auto sales declined
from the near-record 12.1 million unit annual rate of the second quarter
to a 10.9 million unit annual rate in July as sales of domestic units
fell 860,000 units to a 9.0 million annual pace. Sales declined late
in the month, following the end of General Motors' sales incentive
contests.
Since February, more than half of the rise in total retail
sales has been attributable to the surge in durable goods spending--a
phenomena consistent with recent trends in consumer attitudes as
surveyed by the Michigan Research Center. In July, the index of
sentiment rose, returning to the April-May level, and consumers continued

to evaluate buying conditions as favorable for large household
durables, cars, and houses. A record proportion of survey respon-
dents--more than half--reported that anticipated price increases
were a major reason that the present was a good time to buy durable
goods.
Growth of personal income picked up somewhat in June,
increasing at a 10-1/2 per cent annual rate after a downward-revised
advance of only 8 per cent in May. The more moderate rise in nominal
income during recent months has been due to a deceleration of wage and
salary growth. Rising farm prices, however, contributed to a sizable
monthly increase in the income of farm proprietors for the third
consecutive month. However, real personal income declined in both
May and June, as consumer prices continued to rise rapidly. Incoming
data on hours and earnings suggest a further increase of wages and
salaries in July; in addition, total personal income growth was boosted
by the annual cost-of-living increase for Social Security recipients.
Residential Construction
Total private housing starts were at a 2.10 million unit
annual rate in June, about the same level as the preceding three months
and only slightly below the advanced rate of the fourth quarter of
last year. In the single-family sector, starts were down slightly in
June to a 1.43 million unit annual rate. This decline was more than
offset by a rise in multifamily starts. The second-quarter pace of
643 thousand units for multifamily starts was the highest since the

first quarter of 1974; the recent strength in this sector appears to
have come largely from non-subsidized activity as only a tenth of the
quarterly rise was accounted for by subsidized starts under the
Section 8 rental assistance program. Meanwhile, vacancy rates were
little changed in the second quarter and rental markets continued
relatively tight.
Business Investment
The book value of manufacturers' inventories increased at a
$16.7 billion annual rate in June, and the buildup for the second
quarter was a $20.9 billion rate. Large price increases have contributed
to the sizable rise in book-value inventories. Relative to sales,
book-value stocks in manufacturing and trade generally remain low. Most
of the inventory investment so far this year has been in durable goods
and this trend continued in June.
New orders for nondefense capital goods, which have been on
a plateau since February, declined 2.4 per cent in June following an
increase of about 4 per cent in May. For the second quarter as a whole,
these bookings increased 2-1/2 per cent, after rising strongly in the
first quarter. The weakness in June was fairly widespread and the
machinery component of nondefense capital goods, a good indicator of
the underlying demand for heavy capital equipment, was somewhat below
the December level. By contrast, these machinery orders grew 22 per
cent in 1977.

II -10
Construction contracts for private nonresidential structures--
a volatile series--dropped sharply in June. In the absence of awards
for power plants, the nonbuilding component dropped particularly sharply
in June, and contracts for manufacturing buildings also slowed
considerably. For the first half of 1978, however, these awards were
11 per cent above the comparable period of 1977 in nominal terms. In
contrast to contract commitments, private nonresidential construction
put-in-place rose rapidly throughout the second quarter. In June, such
construction spending was 19 per cent above a year earlier.
Government Sector Activity
Unified Federal budget receipts were somewhat larger than
expected in June, with the increase occurring primarily in withheld
individual tax receipts. It now appears that FY 1978 receipts will
total about $401 billion--roughly $1 billion more than the Administration's
mid-year projection. Spending in June was a bit more than expected, but
FY 1978 outlays are still projected to total $450 billion. As a result,
a $49 billion deficit is anticipated in the current fiscal year.
Looking ahead to fiscal year 1979, the Administration's Mid-
Session Review projects a $48-1/2 billion deficit, with outlays and
receipts totalling $496-1/2 billion and $448 billion, respectively.
Consideration of alternative spending and tax proposals may lead to
changes in their totals.

Spending by States and localities has moderated somewhat
after substantial increases early in the second quarter. Value of
construction put-in-place declined slightly in June, following sharp
gains during the three preceding months. In real terms, such outlays
were about 4 per cent above a year earlier.. Employment by these
governments was up 20,000 in July after being unchanged in June.
Prices
Inflation continued at a rapid pace in June, as retail prices
registered their third consecutive monthly increase of 0.9 per cent.
Over the first half, retail prices accelerated to a 10-1/2 per cent
annual rate from a 6-3/4 per cent rate over all of last year. At the
same time, the gross business product fixed-weighted price index rose
at a 9 per cent annual rate over the first half of 1978. While food
prices have been a major source of the acceleration, other factors
also have contributed to the advance. Excluding food and energy items,
consumer prices have risen about 9 per cent (annual rate) so far this
year compared to a 6-1/2 per cent increase during 1977.
Retail food prices rose at more than an 18 per cent annual
rate during the past six months, with beef and fresh vegetables showing
the most dramatic increases. Prices of sugar and sweets as well as
dairy products, which were boosted by U.S. Government price supports,
also have risen sharply. Some moderation occurred in food price
increases during June, as prices of fresh vegetables, pork, eggs,

and coffee declined. A decline in prices received by farmers between
mid-June and mid-July may indicate further near-term moderation in
retail food price increased.
Another source of acceleration in retail prices has been
in the services category. The dominant factors in the speed-up have
been home financing costs and natural gas and electricity prices which
have risen at annual rates of nearly 20 per cent. Earlier in the year,
prices of numerous other services were boosted, partly in response to
the minimum wage hike. In June, service prices advanced further,
although the rise in medical costs moderated from their high first-
quarter rates. In addition, prices for nonfood commodities were boosted
in June by sharp increases for new and used cars as well as houses,
while most nondurable commodities were up modestly.
Compensation and Productivity
Hourly compensation--which includes both wages and supplements--
increased at about an 8 per cent annual rate in the second quarter in
the nonfarm business sector after rising at a 12 per cent rate in the
first quarter. The slowing reflected in part smaller wage increases
as both the direct and indirect adjustments to the minimum wage hike,
especially in the trade and service sectors, were largely completed.
Since March, the index of hourly earnings has risen at an 8 per cent
annual rate, following a 10 per cent rate in the first three months
of the year.

While hourly compensation has continued to rise substantially,
productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector has remained weak.
Output per hour in this sector has registered gains of less than 1 per
cent a year, or has declined, in five of the last seven quarters.
Output growth was quite strong, in the second quarter, but it was
accompanied by the sharpest quarterly increase in total hours worked
in 25 years, and productivity was little changed. By contrast, with
a slowing of additions to factory payrolls, output per hour in manufac-
turing rebounded sharply in the second quarter.
With nonfarm business sector productivity little changed in
the second quarter, unit labor costs rose at a 7-1/2 per cent annual
rate to a level 8-1/2 per cent above a year ago. This substantial
increase in unit costs followed an exceptionally large first-quarter
rise that was associated with weak output growth and mandated compen-
sation increases.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Market interest rates generally have moved lower since the last
FOMC meeting, and stock prices have increased sharply. Yields on most
fixed-income securities have declined 20 to 35 basis points. The easing
in security markets, following substantial tightening in previous months,
reflected a number of developments. The rise in the Federal funds rate
into the 7-7/8 per cent area from 7-3/4 per cent was less than many market
participants had anticipated. Moreover, interest rate expectations
apparently have been tempered by a slowing of M-1 growth, by incoming
data suggesting that economic activity has moderated significantly from
the strong second quarter pace, and by Chairman Miller's recent statements
that market interest rates may be near a cyclical peak. Treasury bill
rates have been subject to additional downward pressure due to substantial
demand for these instruments by foreign central banks investing funds
obtained in dollar exchange support operations.
M-1 growth in July was down slightly from June and well below
the rapid pace for the second quarter as a whole. At commercial banks,
growth of total time and savings deposits subject to rate ceilings was
quite sluggish, and managed liabilities were utilized to help finance
strong credit expansion. Deposit growth at the nonbank thrift institu-
tions increased significantly in July, as the new money market certificates
again attracted sizable volumes of funds. Nevertheless, S&Ls continued
to borrow heavily from the FHLBanks to help meet demands for mortgage
credit.

Funds raised by nonfinancial businesses and households during
July apparently remained around the volume registered in June. Short-
and intermediate-term business borrowing picked up from the reduced June
pace, while gross offerings of bonds by nonfinancial corporations remained
relatively light and new equity issues declined. Home mortgage borrowing
appears to have edged up from the moderately improved second quarter rate,
and consumer credit growth probably held near the extremely rapid pace
of recent months. Funds raised by the public sectors have shown largely
seasonal changes. Long- and short-term borrowing by State and local
governments declined moderately in July, before seasonal adjustment.
While Treasury borrowing increased somewhat, it remained about in line
with the pace of the second quarter, after allowance for seasonal varia-
tions.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M-1 grew at a 4-3/4 per cent annual rate in July, compared with
6 per cent in June and 9-1/2 per cent for the second quarter as a whole.
The slowdown in M-1 growth during June and July may have reflected a
lagged response to System tightening actions begun in the spring, along
with moderation in the pace of economic activity and the accompanying
demand for transactions balances. In addition, unusual increases in
Treasury deposits over the two months further restrained M-1 growth.
M-2 advanced at an 8 per cent annual rate in July, about the
same as in the preceding two months. Growth in the interest-earning
component of M-2 (line 5 of the table) picked up slightly, owing entirely

to a surge in the large time deposits included in this aggregate--non-
negotiable CDs and negotiable CDs at other than weekly reporting banks.
Total time and savings deposits subject to rate ceilings (line 12) posted
only a small advance. Growth in small-denomination time deposits (line 10)
slowed somewhat from the relatively brisk pace of June--despite a sharp
increase in issuance of the new money market certificates, which are
included in this category. Savings deposits declined more markedly than
in June; most of the weakness reflected withdrawals by domestic govern-
ment units,1/ as deposits of individuals fell by somewhat less than in
June.
M-3 expansion accelerated in July, as deposit growth at nonbank
thrift institutions advanced further. Judging from survey results, money
market certificates continued to attract a sizable volume of deposits at
the thrifts.2/ As of July 20, S&Ls had issued an estimated $9.6 billion
of the certificates, representing more than 2 per cent of total deposits
outstanding at these institutions. Latest available survey data for MSBs
(July 5) suggest that money market certificate balances at these insti-
tutions stood at roughly $2.4 billion.
1/ Some of the decline in domestic government savings balances may have
been seasonal. Lack of sufficient data for regular seasonal adjustment
procedures makes it difficult to determine the extent to which changes
represent normal seasonal patterns.
2/ Despite the performance of the new certificates, alternative short-term
investments continued to attract substantial amounts of funds in July.
Combined assets of money market mutual funds expanded by nearly $500
million to a record $7.3 billion. Noncompetitive tenders at weekly
Treasury bill auctions averaged $578 million (SA), compared with $534
million in June.

Commercial bank loans and investments expanded at a 16-3/4 per
cent annual rate in July. Loans increased at a 19-1/2 per cent rate,
and bank holdings of Treasury and other securities also rose during the
month. Strength in bank lending was widespread among the major loan
categories. Growth in business loans rebounded to a 10-3/4 per cent
annual rate, up from the June pace but still well below average rates of
growth in the first two quarters of the year. Real estate loans at all
commercial banks continued to expand rapidly, and evidence for large
banks suggests that consumer lending may have maintained the vigorous
pace of recent months.
The sharp increase in commercial bank lending this year has
raised loan-to-deposit ratios at banks of all sizes,with the exception
of large banks in New York City (see chart, p. I-8). The upturn has
been most marked at the largest regional banks (very large banks outside
New York City), and for these and other large banks (outside New York
City), ratios have been approaching the peaks reached in 1974. At
smaller nonagricultural banks, loan-to-deposit ratios advanced through
March (most recent data available) to the highest level of the decade.
Moreover, at agricultural banks1/ loan-to-deposit ratios in the first
quarter appear to have resumed the general uptrend that has been evident
since 1975, following a decline last fall associated with improved farm
income.
1/ Agricultural banks are those with agricultural loans accounting for
more than 25 per cent of total loans.

Some reports indicate that, with loan demand strong relative to
deposit inflows, regional and smaller banks have recently been tightening
their own business loan terms and have been turning to larger correspondents
for loan participations. In contrast to earlier periods, however, the
generally high loan-to-deposit ratios have not as yet been accompanied by
widespread reports of unavailable funds or severe stringency in the terms
of lending.
The commercial banking system again turned to managed liabilities
in order to help finance loan growth in July. Funds raised through large-
denomination time deposits (not subject to rate ceilings) picked up during
the month, although expansion of negotiable CDs at large banks was well
below the pace established earlier in the year. Nondeposit sources of
funds edged higher in July, as member bank borrowing both from the discount
window and from foreign branches advanced.
Business Credit
The pickup in business lending at commercial banks in July was
concentrated at small banks; growth at large banks was weak during both
June and July, following a surge in May. Earlier in the year, growth in
business term loans at large banks was vigorous, keeping pace with the
expansion of short-term business lending. Some of this strength apparently
was due to willingness by large banks to make term loans at fixed, rather
than floating, rates of interest. More recently, some regional banks

reportedly have become less interested in making term loans at fixed
rates, and term lending at large banks has slowed somewhat.
Business loan commitments outstanding at selected large com-
mercial banks have continued the uptrend that has characterized the past
three years, as firms have built their credit lines as a hedge against
possible future financing needs (see chart, p. III-10). The surge in
loans this year has lowered the ratio of unused to total commitments
noticeably, but the level of unused lines remains well above the esti-
mated lows of late 1974. The large volume of unused commitments repre-
sents a potential source of pressure on commercial bank liquidity.
Commercial paper issued by nonfinancial businesses continued
to expand rapidly in July, continuing a trend that has characterized
most of 1978. The sum of bank loans to businesses (excluding bankers
acceptances held at large banks) and nonfinancial commercial paper
expanded at a 16-1/4 per cent annual rate, up significantly from June
but somewhat below the second quarter pace.
Finance company lending to businesses slowed further in June
(latest data available), increasing at an 8-1/2 per cent annual rate.
During the first half of this year, growth of such lending was at about
half the exceptional 23 per cent rate recorded in 1977. The slowdown
was associated primarily with reductions in the wholesale automotive
category, as dealer inventories of cars and trucks peaked early in the
spring and then declined. With strong growth in bank loans to business
and the expansion of nonfinancial commercial paper, the share of total

short- and intermediate-term business lending accounted for by finance
companies declined somewhat during the first half of 1978, following
sizable increases in 1976 and 1977.
In long-term markets, gross public offerings of corporate
bonds by nonfinancial corporations totaled $1.3 billion in July, as a
somewhat heavier slate of utility issues was about offset by a reduced
amount of industrial issues. Contrary to the typical seasonal decline,
however, the total of corporate bond offerings increased $300 million to
$2.1 billion, as issues by financial concerns increased sharply. The
relatively strong pace of bond issues by financial businesses can be
attributed largely to continued heavy offerings by finance companies.
Total finance company lending--to both consumers and businesses--has
grown by record amounts in recent quarters, and these institutions have
attempted to maintain a relatively constant mix between short-term
(mostly commercial paper) and longer-term liabilities.
The Board's index of yields on newly-issued Aaa-rated utility
bonds was 8.96 per cent in early August, more than 20 basis points below
its reading prior to the last FOMC meeting. The recent decline in cor-
porate bond yields has been accompanied by a narrowing in risk premia.
Newly issued A-rated utility bonds currently yield about 40 basis points
more than Aaa-rated issues, down from 60 basis points in late June.
Most major stock price indexes have increased 6 to 8 per cent
since the last FOMC meeting. The N.Y.S.E. Composite index is currently
about 10 per cent above its level at year-end 1977, while the A.S.E. and

III -14
N.A.S.D.A.Q. composite indexes are up almost 25 per cent. Investor
sentiment was buoyed by the recent decline in interest rates and the
strong second quarter rebound in corporate profits; proposals for
reducing the tax on capital gains also have been a positive factor.
Equity offerings have shown no response as yet to the increase in stock
prices. Indeed, they totaled only $400 million in July, sharply below
June's 1978 high of $1.2 billion. As in other recent months, public
utilities accounted for most of the total.
Government Finance
Gross offerings of long-term State and local government debt
totaled $3.7 billion in July, down from June's $4.2 billion total;
refundings amounted to about $400 million, essentially unchanged from
the preceding month. However, a near-record volume of new municipal
bonds was marketed in the first week of August, including a large amount
of advance refunding issues. Municipal bond yields have declined sub-
stantially since the last FOMC meeting, following four months of increase,
but the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable bond yields has remained well
above its record low in late March.
The relative weakness of the tax-exempt market in recent months
has been associated with a heavy pace of offerings and reduced demand
for municipal securities by managed bond funds. In June (latest data
available), redemptions surpassed sales for the first month since the
inception of the tax-exempt bond funds about two years ago. Private

III -15
analysts attributed the curtailed flow of net new money to investor
apprehension of further deterioration in the share prices of these
mutual funds.
The Treasury has raised about $6.0 billion of new cash in the
markets since mid-year, representing about 60 per cent of its financing
requirements for this quarter. Since the last FOMC meeting, the Treasury
has obtained $300 million in an auction of 1-year bills, and $1.3 billion
in conjunction with an offering of 2-year notes. In addition, $2.6 bil-
lion of new cash was raised from the domestic public in the latest mid-
quarter financing operation as the Treasury sold $7.0 billion of new
issues to redeem $4.4 billion of maturing securities. Specific issues
in this operation included $2.5 billion of 3-year notes, $3.0 billion of
7-year notes, and $1.5 billion of 30-year bonds.1/ Foreign accounts
purchased an additional $650 million of Treasury securities in the refund-
ing operation, bringing the total amount of new cash raised to $3-1/4 bil-
lion.
Borrowing by sponsored credit agencies has continued at the
relatively strong rate of the second quarter, totalling about $2.0 billion
(on a settlement basis) during July. The bulk of agency borrowing has
been associated with continuing (support of the mortgage markets by
the Federal and related housing agencies--primarily FNMA and FHLBanks.
1/ The auction averages on these issues were within 10 basis points of
each other, highlighting the flatness of the current Treasury yield
curve beyond the 1-year maturity area.

Mortgage Markets
Mortgage market conditions apparently have stabilized in recent
weeks after tightening significantly in the first half of the year.
Average contract interest rates on new commitments for 80 per cent 30-year
conventional home mortgages at sampled S&Ls have risen only slightly since
mid-June;1/ and although about two-thirds of the S&Ls have continued to
report supplies of mortgage funds below normal seasonal patterns, the
proportion reporting substantially short supplies has fallen significantly
since early June. Secondary market yields for Government-underwritten
home loans, which move closely with yields on intermediate-term Treasury
securities, have declined markedly since the last FOMC meeting. Moreover,
offerings in the last two biweekly FNMA auctions of commitments to pur-
chase home mortgages were well below other recent auctions, reflecting in
part some downward revision of interest rate expectations by mortgage
originators.
The total volume of mortgage lending in July apparently edged up
from the moderately improved second quarter level. The increase in real
estate loans at commercial banks was about the same as the large monthly
average rise in the second quarter. Net purchases by FNMA of FHA/VA and
conventional home mortgages declined somewhat from the extraordinary
$14.5 billion annual rate of the second quarter, but issues of the GNMA-
1/ With rates averaging around 9.75 per cent nationally, originations of
home mortgages have reportedly been constrained in some areas by State
usury ceilings; 14 States currently have ceilings of 10 per cent and in
six States they are below the 10 per cent level. However, FHA/VA loans
are exempt from the ceilings in most States, and 8 of the 20 States
permit the charging of points to raise effective yields above ceiling
rates. Average points charged on conventional mortgages by S&Ls rose
to 1.5 in early July, but have edged off in recent weeks.

SSLs, seasonally adjusted mortgage commitments outstanding declined
for the sixth consecutive month in June to $31.2 billion (latest data
available), although the decline was more moderate than in other recent
months as new commitment activity picked up somewhat.2/ In view of
the further increase in S&L deposit flows in July--and continued heavy
borrowing from the FHLBanks3/-it is likely that S&L net mortgage lending
last month was moderately above the second quarter average.
Life insurance companies issued new mortgage loan commitments
in record volume during the first five months of 1978 (latest data
available), raising commitments outstanding to $18.5 billion--more than
25 per cent above their year-end 1977 level. This commitment activity
has been heavily concentrated in the nonresidential sector, despite some
expansion of 1- to 4-family and multifamily mortgage commitments.
Sustained strength in new commercial construction activity--primarily
office buildings, shopping centers, and warehouses--has generated demand
for eventual permanent mortgage financing.
1/ Issues of privately-insured pass-through securities backed by pools
of conventional mortgages, which totaled about $450 million during
the March-May period, have tapered off recently.
2/ Net mortgage acquisitions by S&Ls also recovered moderately in June,
due in large part to a reduction in loan sales.
3/ Borrowing from the FHLBanks in July was $1.0 billion, down slightly
from $1.3 billion in June.

Federal backstop support of the residential mortgage markets
has been substantial recently. Commitments outstanding to purchase
mortgages at the major Federal and related agencies operating in the
secondary mortgage markets--FNMA, GNMA, and FHLMC--were $18 billion at
the end of June, compared with $10 billion at the end of 1977. The bulk
of this increase has been due to issuance by FNMA of nearly $15 billion
of 4- and 12-month optional delivery commitments, primarily to mortgage
companies.
Consumer Finances
Consumer instalment credit grew at an annual rate of slightly
more than 20 per cent during June and the second quarter as a whole,
bolstered by vigorous expansion in auto credit. Commercial banks
accounted for almost half the total second quarter advance, and the
figures for weekly reporting banks suggest that instalment credit growth
remained strong in July.
The continued expansion of consumer and home mortgage debt
raised the aggregate debt burden of households--measured by the ratio
of repayments to disposable personal income--to a new high in the
second quarter, based on revised estimates. Meanwhile, the liquid
financial net worth of households,1/ expressed in real per capita terms,
turned down in the second quarter, resuming the general decline begun
in the third quarter of 1976.
1/ Household sector holdings of deposits and securities, less debts owed.

III -22
Despite the movements in these financial ratios, direct
measures of payment difficulties have shown little sign of deterioration.
In fact, delinquency rates for both finance company auto loans and
mortgage loans at savings and loan associations are reported to have
drifted down during the second quarter, from already low levels, and
personal bankruptcies fell to the lowest pace in five years. In this
regard, it should also be noted that the aggregate debt burden ratios
have been affected by demographic and other factors increasing the
diffusion of debt among households. For example, a rise in the pro-
portion of the population aged 25 to 34 years--normally the group with
the highest incidence of debt--has contributed to the upward trend in
the aggregate debt ratios.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. Exchange markets have become increas-
ingly nervous and unsettled in the past four weeks. Rates have been volatile
and have changed widely on very little news. There was a significant shift
in the general pattern of exchange rates as the results of the Bremen
summit meeting on July 17 did not change the market's view that major
differences in inflation rates and trade balances would persist for some
time.
Market attention was initially on the Japanese yen which began
to appreciate sharply, following the release of the Japanese trade figures
for June, which showed a continuing large surplus. In late July the yen
moved below 200 yen/dollar, and for several days gained nearly one per
cent per day,
As uncertainties increased and rumors of a possible tightening of capital
controls intensified, movements in the yen became more erratic. Compared
with four weeks earlier, the yen is currently 8-3/4 per cent higher against
the dollar and about 6-1/2 per cent higher on a weighted-average basis.
Following a statement by a Swiss official that exchange rate
adjustments are to be expected when countries have large differences in
inflation rates, the Swiss franc also began to advance sharply. In the
past four weeks it too has risen more than 8-1/2 per cent against the
dollar and more than 5-1/2 per cent on a weighted-average basis. Other
European currencies also strengthened against the dollar but not uniformly.
Throughout July, the French franc, Italian lira, and British pound appreciated

against both the snake and the dollar as the market interpreted the com-
mitment at Bremen for closer monetary union as reducing the downside risk
on the traditionally weaker currencies. Even within the snake, exchange
rate pressures developed and the Belgian franc was kept within the margins
.In the second week
of August, however, the mark began to move sharply, going below 2 marks/
dollar, and the snake regained some of its relative position. The Canadian
dollar was the only currency to weaken noticeably against the U.S. dollar,
falling nearly 1 per cent. As a result of the movements in various rates,
the weighted-average value of the dollar in early August was about 3-3/4
per cent below its level a month earlier.
The Desk acquired over $600 million of marks for use in swap
repayments. Between July 12 and August 8, the System repaid nearly $370

equivalent. On several occasions, the Desk intervened in support of the
dollar;
.On August 8, however, pressure on the dollar
against the mark intensified; the United States once again drew on its
swap line with the Bundesbank. The System drew $38.5 million equivalent,
bringing its outstanding swap commitments to $603 million equivalent;
the ESF's drawings brought its commitment to $163 million equivalent.
Exchange market uncertainties spilled over into the gold market,
and gold rose above $200 per ounce. As of August 9, the gold price in
London was $208.00.

International capital markets. Gross new borrowing in inter-
national capital markets in the second quarter of 1978 approximated the
very high level reached in the first quarter. Consequently, for the
first half of this year total borrowing exceeded the level of the second
half of 1977 by almost 30 per cent (mostly because of increased bank
credits), and the first half of 1977 by over 40 per cent. Some of the
increase reflects refinancing of maturing or existing credits but most
appears to be new financing. The second quarter of 1978 saw some reduc-
tion from the previous three months in medium-term Euro-credits despite
a record-size credit for Canada. Loan spreads fell further and maturi-
ties continued to lengthen. The volume of new Euro-bonds recovered in
the second quarter despite a five-week prohibition on German mark
issues and renewed depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Foreign bond
issues also increased as placements in Japan recorded another large rise.
New medium-term Euro-credits completed in the second quarter
amounted to $13 billion, about 10 per cent below the first quarter. In
June the Canadian Government signed an agreement for a $3 billion 8-year
revolving Euro-credit from a group of predominantly U.S. banks. Although
the loan was partly syndicated among non-U.S. banks the interest rate
will be equal to the U.S. prime rate for the first four years and
1/4 per cent over prime after that. This feature is a departure from
normal Euro-market practice. As of the end of July $700 million of the
credit had been drawn. Other developed countries that increased their
borrowing in the second quarter were Italy and the United Kingdom, in-
cluding a Shell Petroleum borrowing of $800 million (a record for a

private company) for 10 years. Italian borrowers, out of the market
almost entirely for three years, began to return in late 1977 as
Italy's credit standing improved, and in the first half of 1978 have
completed $1 billion of Euro-credits. In contrast, there were no French
borrowings in the second quarter (reflecting a reduced deficit in
France's current account), Spain, Denmark and Sweden borrowed less, and
there were smaller takings from the market by the oil-exporting coun-
tries, the non-oil LDCs, and Communist countries. For the first half
of 1978 borrowing by non-oil LDCs shows a modest increase over the sec-
ond half of 1977 despite a sharp decline in new credits to Mexico.
The second-quarter decline in spreads on Euro-credits seems
to have been smaller than in the previous several quarters and more
centered on borrowers of less than top quality. The "prime spread"
seems to have held at about 5/8 per cent over LIBOR. To take advantage
of lower spreads, the Philippines borrowed $500 million and Malaysia
$100 million in the second quarter partly or wholly to refinance exist-
ing credits on better terms; these followed first-quarter loans to
Indonesia and Malaysia (totalling $900 million) arranged for the same
purpose. New loans in a 20-country sample show the average final matu-
rity rising to 9 years in the second quarter of 1978 compared with
8 years in the first quarter and 6.6 years in the third quarter of 1977
before the present lengthening of maturities began.
New Euro-bond issues rose over 10 per cent in the second quar-
ter, to a rate somewhat higher than in the second half of last year.
The volume of new U.S. dollar issues increased 25 per cent, almost as
much as the first quarter decline, in spite of the renewed decline in

IV -8
the exchange rate of the dollar in June. Flotations of German mark is-
sues were slightly lower for the quarter as a whole than in the first
quarter. To mitigate upward pressure on German bond yields the German
authorities prohibited further DM issues by nonresidents beginning May 12,
but lifted the ban on June 20 as official efforts to counter the rise in
domestic bond yields were abandoned. In the Euro-bond market yields on
most categories of dollar- and mark-denominated bonds rose 10 to 20
basis points from end-March to end-June.
The percentage of total Euro-bond issues denominated in dol-
lars rose from 47 per cent in the first quarter to 52 per cent in the
second while the percentage for DM-denominated bonds fell from 41 per
cent to 36 per cent. Even so, the dollar-bond share was considerably
lower, and DM-bond share higher, than was customary until late 1977.
The dollar-bond share averaged 60 per cent in 1974-76 and 68 per cent
in the first three quarters of 1977 before falling to 50 per cent in the
last quarter as the exchange rate of the dollar fell. The DM-bond share,
which averaged 20 per cent in 1974-76, was 22 per cent in the first three
quarters of last year but rose to 39 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Foreign bond issues were also up more than 10 per cent in the
second quarter despite a reduction in Canadian borrowing. Issues in
the U.S. market increased and included $350 million of British Govern-
ment 8- and 15-year bonds in April. Issues in Japan increased again,
by nearly two-thirds, and were second in volume only to issues in the
U.S. market. However, a weakening in Japanese bond prices has led to
the postponement of several foreign yen issues scheduled for the third
quarter.

U.S. nternational transactions. Information on second-
quarter capital transactions in the U.S. international accounts is
incomplete and may be subject to more revisions than usual because
of a series of data problem related in part to the recent intro-
duction of a new reporting system.
Capital transactions. Available data indicate that net
private capital flows through banks appear to have registered a
sizable inflow in the second quarter, and net foreign purchases
(private and official) of U.S. corporate stock rose to $1.3 billion
in the quarter.
Foreign official assets in the United States (excluding
OPEC holdings) dropped by about $4 billion in the second quarter;
OPEC net investments in the United States declined by $2 billion.

U.S. merchandise trade. In June, the U.S. trade deficit
was smaller than in any other month this year by a substantial margin.
This reduced the second quarter deficit to $32 billion at an annual
rate, international accounts basis, compared with a $45 billion
annual rate deficit in the first quarter. Most of the change between
quarters was generated by a strong increase in exports, while imports
rose only moderately. (See chart following.)

Agricultural exports increased by 22 per cent in the
second quarter with most of the increase in volume; agricultural
export prices rose by 7 per cent on average. The largest increases
were in corn, soybeans, and wheat. While agricultural exports to
all areas increased, the sharpest increases were in shipments to
Eastern Europe and the developing countries. Smaller harvests
than had been expected in the Southern Hemisphere contributed to
increased demands for U.S. supplies.
Nonagricultural exports increased by 12 per cent in
the second quarter, nearly all in volume; prices increased by less
than 2 per cent. The increase in the second quarter was the first
substantial rise in these exports in more than a year. Part of
the pick-up was a recovery of coal exports from strike-depressed
first quarter levels. But the largest part of the increase was in
machinery exports and a broad range of other commodities. The sharp
rise in machinery exports went to both the developed and the
developing countries.
Oil imports were higher in the second quatter than in
the first quarter, but much of the rise can be attributed to an
unusually low figure that was recorded in March and an unusually
high figure that was recorded in April. Using an average of these
two months in both quarters, oil imports in both the first and

IV -14
second quarters were about 8.5 million barrels per day. For
comparison purposes, during the second half of 1977 oil was imported
at a rate of 9.0 million barrels per day. Domestic stocks of oil
were drawn down sharply, primarily during the first quarter, from
the unusually high levels of late last year. In the second quarter,
there were only moderate changes in stock levels. The price of
imported oil has averaged about $13.25 per barrel since early this
year.
Non-oil imports increased only moderately in the second
quarter. Price increases more than accounted for the rise, as the
volume of imports declined from the high levels reached in the
first quarter. As expected, the strong build-up in some commodities
earlier in the year was reversed in recent months. The volume of
steel imports dropped off sharply in both May and June, more than
offsetting a fairly substantial price increase (23 per cent from
April to June); May and June were the first months the Treasury's
trigger-price mechanism was effectively in operation. While showing
a small increase for the quarter, foreign car imports declined in
both May and June. Current levels of inventories are at record
high levels and may restrain imports, particularly since sales
have slowed. Retail prices of foreign cars have risen faster than

IV -15
prices of U.S. small cars (an average of about 15 per cent
compared with an average of about 10 per cent.) Another large
decline was in coffee imports; since the end of last year, import
prices for coffee have dropped 12 per cent and the volume has
declined 7 per cent. These declines partly offset increases in
other commodity categories, particularly in other industrial
supplies, consumer goods, and capital goods.

IV -16
Foreign Economic Developments. Recent economic developments
in foreign countries show: (1) indications of slowing domestic demand,
notably in Germany and Japan; (2) a halt in the moderating trend of
price increases in many countries during the second quarter; and (3)
continued growth of the Japanese and German current-account surpluses.
Signs of weakness in several countries during the second quarter, follow-
ing some improvement earlier from sluggish 1977 growth rates, formed the
background for pledges to take expansionary action during the Bonn Summit
meeting on July 17.
Industrial production in Germany declined by nearly 1 per cent
during the second quarter of 1978, continuing the weakening trend observed
in the first quarter. Production of investment goods, which had declined
in the first quarter, fell even further in the second. Japanese indus-
trial production fell in June -- the first decline in eight months -- and
rose only 1.5 per cent in the second quarter after a 3 per cent first
quarter increase. Domestic demand grew only 0.4 per cent in the first
quarter of 1978, in spite of support from increased government expendi-
tures, and there are signs that it may be weakening further. Italian
industrial production fell in the second quarter, and Canadian, French,
and British industrial production fell in May (the latest month for
which data are available).
Rates of consumer price increase rose slightly in the second
quarter of 1978 in all of the larger foreign industrial countries except
Germany. To combat these increases, the Italian government is preparing
a three-year plan including budgetary measures and programs to cut labor

IV -17
costs, and the United Kingdom adopted a new government wage policy
calling for a 5 per cent limit on wage increases over the next 12
months. Rates of consumer price increase declined during the second
quarter of 1978 in most of the smaller industrial countries.
The $2.3 billion Japanese current-account surplus in June
was the highest monthly surplus of the year, and indications are that
the July surplus may be at least as large. The total surplus for the
first half of 1978 was $10.5 billion, nearly equal to the $11 billion
total for all of 1977. The German current-account surplus in June was
$1.1 billion, bringing the total surplus for the first half of 1978 to
$3.8 billion, nearly equal to the $3.9 billion surplus for all of 1977.
In Japan, the rising current-account surplus reflects a rising trade
surplus, chiefly attributable to large increases in export prices in
dollar terms. In Germany, on the other hand, the rising current-account
surplus reflects both a rising trade surplus and a shrinking invisibles
deficit. German export volumes are expected to grow roughly in line
with the growth of world trade in 1978, but Japanese export volumes
have declined in recent months.
In the Bonn Summit declaration of July 17, Japan promised an
attempt to speed up domestic demand in order to attain 7 per cent real
GNP growth in the current fiscal year, while holding exports to their
level of the last fiscal year. The German government pledged to pro-
pose stimulatory fiscal policy measures totalling about 1 per cent of
GNP to the legislature this month. The French pledged to increase their
budget deficit for 1978 by 1/2 per cent of GNP. Italy pledged to try to

achieve a real GNP growth rate in 1979 1-1/2 per cent above the 1978
growth rate, while cutting public expenditure and raising taxes.
Canada and the United Kingdom, countries which expect higher growth
rates in 1979, pledged to continue to fight inflation.
The Canadian, Belgian, and Dutch central banks raised their
discount rates during the last week of July in response to foreign
exchange market pressures. Denmark and Sweden cut their discount
rates, reflecting an easing of external pressures.
Notes on Individual Countries. Domestic economic activity in
Germany continued to weaken in the second quarter of 1978. Industrial
production fell by nearly 1 per cent from the preceding quarter, reflect-
ing declining activity in all domestic industries except construction,
with the most severe declines in investment goods industries. Both
domestic and foreign orders stagnated in the second quarter. Consumer
price increases continued to moderate during the second quarter, with
prices reaching a level of about 2-1/2 per cent above the previous
year; the CPI was unchanged in July.
In response to growing indications of weakness in domestic
demand (and in fulfillment of its Bonn Summit commitment), the German
Cabinet has proposed stimulatory fiscal policy measures for the 1979
budget. The stimulus package, to be presented to the legislature later
this month, includes personal income tax cuts and increased expenditures,
whose impact would be partially offset by a rise in the VAT in mid-1979.
The German authorities have estimated that these measures will raise the
real GNP growth rate by about 1 per cent in 1979.

IV -20
In Japan, the current-account surplus in June exceeded $2.3
billion (seasonally adjusted), making it the highest monthly surplus of
the year so far. The large June surplus was attributable in part to a
sharp decline in oil imports, after a substantial increase in the pre-
vious month. Also, recent appreciation of the yen has continued to
raise the dollar price of Japanese exports. According to preliminary
government reports, the July trade surplus exceeded that in June. The
Japanese authorities are reported to be considering additional controls
on capital movements.
Inflation in Japan has continued to moderate; both wholesale
prices and consumer prices declined in June, the latter for the first
time in twelve months. Unemployment remains a serious problem, however,
as the unemployment rate increased another 0.1 per cent in May. Prime
Minister Fukuda and other key officials have reiterated that Japan will
take appropriate measures -- including possible supplementary govern-
ment expenditure -- to meet the announced 7 per cent target for real
GNP growth in FY1978.
Provisional data on consumer spending and retail sales in the
United Kingdom indicate that the consumption-led expansion has continued
in the second quarter, although at a reduced rate. On July 21, the U.K.
government announced its policy on wages for the next 12 months. The
policy calls for a limit of 5 per cent on wage increases during the
period, with some provision for flexibility for settlements involving
a link between increases in wages and increases in labor productivity
and other special cases. The policy is nonstatutory and will be enforced
primarily through the government's influence in public sector wage increases

IV -21
and its ability to withhold government contracts and assistance from
private sector firms that do not adhere to the policy. The policy is
similar to the one in effect during the previous 12-month period except
that the wage norm is 5 per cent rather than 10 per cent. The Trades
Union Congress has not endorsed the new policy, but it had endorsed
only some aspects of last year's policy.
In the first half of 1978, Italy had a (provisional) trade
surplus on a customs basis of $300 million (Italy has not had an
annual trade surplus since 1972). In September, the government will
present details of a three-year economic plan to parliament. The
plan will aim to raise real GNP growth to about 4 per cent next year,
while reducing the rate of CPI increase to under 10 per cent per annum
by the end of 1979. Public spending cuts, tax increases, and measures
to cut labor costs and expand employment will probably be included.
In France, the immediate effects of the government's strategy
to cut the budget deficit and to phase out price controls are beginning
to be felt through higher inflation. (The strategy is aimed at reducing
inflationary pressures in the long run.) Wholesale prices rose at about
an 8 per cent annual rate in the first half of 1978, up from 5-1/2 per
cent in all of 1977, and the rate of CPI increase rose in the second
quarter to an annual rate of nearly 12 per cent.
Industrial production in Canada fell by 0.8 per cent in May.
Growth of personal loans continued to be strong so far in the second
quarter while business loans continue to be weak, indicating continued
trends of moderate growth of personal expenditure and weak investment

expenditure into the second qiarter. The merchandise trade account
was in deficit in June -- the first monthly deficit since 1976.

APPENDIX A*
JULY 1978 REVISION OF NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS1/
The annual revision to the National Income and Product
Accounts (NIPA) left the overall contour of activity during the
years 1975-77 essentially unchanged. The decline in the 1973-75
recession is now shown to have been a bit less than earlier re-
ported (but remains the steepest in the postwar period) and the
subsequent recovery has also been less vigorous than previously
thought. The pattern of quarterly changes in real gross national
product are a bit smoother than earlier reported (see Table I)
and the composition of output is estimated to be somewhat different.
Additionally, the revised estimates indicate that there was more
personal and less business saving in 1975 and 1976 and less of both
in 1977 than earlier indicated. Finally, the government sector as
a whole is now shown to have had a slightly lower deficit over the
three year period covered by the revision.
Summary
Gross national product (GNP) in real terms is estimated
to have increased by 5.7 per cent in 1976 rather than by 6.0 per
cent as earlier reported; the changes in 1975 and 1977 are the
same as previously indicated (-1.3 per cent and +4.9 per cent,
respectively). Quarterly changes in real GNP have been revised
downward in eight of the thirteen quarters covered. By 1978-I
real GNP is now estimated to have risen 15.6 per cent from the
1975-I trough as opposed to 16.3 per cent indicated earlier (the
contraction is now estimated to have been 5.7 per cent rather
than 5.9 per cent). The relatively slower recovery reflected
downward revisions in real consumer and government spending which
were not wholly offset by upward revisions in real business fixed
investment. In current dollar terms, the level of GNP was reduced
by about $6-1/2 billion in 1976 and $2-1/2 billion in 1977. In
general the three year revisions in aggregate GNP price indexes
were not large, although there is now an indication of about a half
point more inflation in 1977 than earlier thought.
1/This revision covers the period 1975 QI through 1978 QI. New
source data which were not available at the time of the earlier
estimates are incorporated and seasonal factors are updated in
the annual July revision.

Division of Research and Statistics.

A-2
Highlights of this revision by sector of activity are as
follows:
1) Business fixed investment was revised upward in all
three years with the 1977 level $5.3 billion higher
in nominal terms than earlier indicated; the 1976
and 1977 revisions were about evenly split between
structures and equipment.
2) Consumer spending in nominal terms was reduced by larger
amounts in each of the three years--reachin $4.7 billion
in 1977. The saving rate was increased a bit in both
1975 and 1976 but was unchanged in 1977.
3) The rate of inventory accumulation in 1976 and 1977
was over $2 billion less in current dollars than
previously reported.
4) Government purchases were a bit lower than had been
estimated earlier and the combined Federal and State
and local government deficit was revised downward.
5) On the income side, personal income was revised down-
ward in both 1976 and 1977, mainly reflecting lower
wage and salary disbursements as well as somewhat less
rent and interest income; proprietors' income estimates
were scaled upward. Corporate profits, both before
and after inventory valuation and capital consumption
adjustments, were revised downward in 1975 and 1976
and upward in 1977.
Consumer Activity
Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) were revised down-
ward in each of the three years included in this revision. In 1975,
the downward revisions were about evenly split between durable goods,
nondurable goods and services; in 1976, more than half of the revi-
sion came in durable goods and the balance was in services. By major
spending category, the revisions show that by the end of 1977 consumers
spent more on furniture, gas and oil, fuel oil and coal and transpor-
tation than previously estimated: on the other hand less was spent on
autos and parts, food, clothing, gas and electricity for household
operation, and other services (which includes medical, personal business,
recreation and education).

In real terms total PCE is now estimated to have risen a
bit more slowly throughout the three year revision period. The
recovery in real PCE from the 1975-I trough through 1978-I is now
estimated at 15.4 per cent instead of the 16.0 per cent indicated
earlier.
Reflecting sharply reduced estimates of wage and salary
disbursements as well as lower receipts of rental and interest
income, personal income was revised downward by increasingly large
amounts beginning in 1976 (see Table III). Offsetting, to some
extent, were higher estimates for other labor income, proprietors'
income, dividends and transfer payments. The reduction in
personal income was muted to some extent by lower estimates of per-
sonal tax and nontax payments; this, combined with sizable downward
revisions in consumer outlays, resulted in slightly higher saving
rates in 1975 and 1976. Nonetheless, the saving rate remains low
in comparison to the early seventies and the level of 5.3 per cent
in 1978-II remains well below the postwar average of 6.1 per cent.
Business Activity (See Table IV)
Business spending on fixed capital goods was revised sharply
upwards throughout the whole period reaching a maximum of $6.8 billion
in 1977-IV and 1978-I. (This is the second consecutive July revision
with large upward adjustments in BFI). In the first year and a half
of the current revision period, the bulk of the revision was mainly
in structures while from 1976-III onward revisions in producers'
durable equipment dominated. In real terms BFI was revised upward
and is now estimated to have risen by 13.7 per cent between 1975-I
and 1978-I rather than by 11.7 per cent. The current BFI recovery
is still lower than in all earlier postwar recoveries except that of
1958.
The revisions in nonfarm business inventory investment, in
current dollars, indicate about $1 billion less liquidation in 1975
and over $2 billion less accumulation in both 1976 and 1977 than
previously estimated. The liquidation in the first half of 1975
still remains the largest of the powtwar period. The quarterly
pattern of inventory investment remains virtually the same as earlier
reported. Movements in the constant dollar nonfarm inventories/final
sales ratio were very little affected by the revision; by 1978-II, this
ratio was well below the 1974-IV high and a bit above the 1959-77
average.

A-4
Corporate profits were revised downward in 1975 and 1976
and upwards sharply in 1977. Economic profits (those with IVA and
capital consumption adjustment2/) are now indicated as being $3 and
$1 billion lower in 1975 and 1976, respectively, but up by $4-1/2
billion in 1977. Profits are now estimated to have risen by 77 per
cent during this recovery rather than by 71 per cent after dropping
almost 25 per cent during the 1973-75 recession; the average in-
crease at this point in the previous 5 postwar recoveries was 46
per cent following an average decline of 16 per cent. The large
1977 revision was about evenly split between before tax (book)
profits and the capital consumption adjustment. Economic cash flow--
as measured by undistributed profits plus capital consumption allow-
ances with the capital consumption adjustment plus inventory valuation
adjustment--was revised downward in all three years given the upward
revision to capital outlays over the period this implies a considerably
larger financing gap than previously indicated.
Other Private Activity
Residential construction and net exports were both little
affected by the revisions with housing outlays showing a bit more
growth than previously thought. Net exports now indicate a bit more
deterioration over the revision period than earlier, as exports were
revised up less than imports.
Government Activity
Federal expenditures were revised down in all three years
with the major downward revisions coming in nondefense purchases of
goods and services, transfer payments,and net interest outlays. Total
receipts were lowered for 1975 and 1976, reflecting the downward revi-
sions to both personal and corporate incomes the upward revision for
1977 mainly reflected higher corporate profits tax accruals which more
than offset the lower take from personal taxes.
Almost all of the upward revision in State and local expen-
ditures was in transfer payments; purchases of goods and services were
revised down in all three years. Greater than earlier-reported corporate
profits tax accruals and Federal grants-in-aid resulted in an upward
2/ The capital consumption adjustment is used to reconcile depreciation

measure of current replacement.

revision in total State and local receipts. This, in turn, resulted
in a scaling upward of the overall State and local surplus. However,
BEA now estimates a much larger surplus for pension funds than indi-
cated previously and a good deal less for operating funds; for 1978-I
the operating surplus was reduced from $18.1 billion to $11.5 billion.
Even with the sizable downward revisions in the "operational surplus,"
recent surpluses still are substantially above the $2 billion average
yearly deficit in the postwar period.
Thus, the revisions indicate that, on the NIPA basis, net
government fiscal activity was a bit less stimulative than earlier
figures had indicated. The combined Federal and State and local
deficit was reduced by about $2-1/2 billion in 1976 and about $1-3/4
billion in 1977; the 1976 reduction largely reflected the greater
State and local surplus while that of 1977 was due to a smaller
Federal deficit. (See Table V.)
Prices
The overall impact of the revision on prices, as measured by
the GNP implicit price deflator was fairly small. The rate of increase
in these prices was unchanged in 1975, down .1 percentage point in 1976
and up .4 points in 1977. (See Table VI.) While the quarterly pattern
of movements in the deflator is essentially unchanged, inflation rates
during most of 1977 were raised from earlier estimates. The gross
domestic business product fixed-weighted price index was little
revised on an annual basis--a bit more rapid increase in 1977 and
less rapid in 1975. However, quarterly revisions in components of
this index (although largely offsetting) were large in many quarters
with somewhat higher rates of inflation in fixed investment items than
earlier thought, apparently reflecting inclusion of annual survey
data in both manufacturing and construction.
