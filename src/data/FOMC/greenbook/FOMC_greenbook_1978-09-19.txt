The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Slower growth of activity continues to be apparent in most
incoming data. Gains in employment and production slowed somewhat in
August, and retail sales remained very sluggish. In the fixed investment
sectors, July housing starts held at a high level, while capital
equipment shipments and nonresidential construction were about unchanged
in July. Moreover, advance indicators suggest a slowing of growth in
capital spending following the surge in the second quarter. Increases
in recent aggregate price indexes were held down by sizable declines in
prices of some farm products and foods.
Employment and Production
Although total employment gains were moderate in August, the
unemployment rate moved back down to 5.9 per cent--slightly below the
average for the first seven months of the year. The decline in jobless-
ness was concentrated among adult women and youth whose unemployment
rates had risen in July. At 3.4 per cent, the unemployment rate for
men aged 25 years and older was little changed in August.
Nonfarm payroll employment grew by 115,000 in August, about
half the average monthly gain of the preceding three months. In the
private service-producing sector hiring continued strong, but employment
in the construction industry edged down after registering impressive
gains for several months. There again were reductions in nondurable
manufacturing and in the durable goods sector, employment was little

changed in August after rising in July. The average workweek for
manufacturing production workers hes been on a relatively high plateau
during the past four months.
Industrial production is tentatively estimated to have risen
about 1/2 per cent in August. Owing to data revisions, somewhat larger
increases now seem likely for the two preceding months. Output of
business equipment, which has been a major source of strength over the
past year, apparently registered another healthy gain in August. In
addition, raw steel production rose for the fifth successive month.
However, consumer goods production has continued on a plateau since April.
In particular, auto production has been little changed since the spring
surge in assemblies.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing apparently edged up
fractionally in August to a level slightly above the historical average.
With capacity expanding at about a 4 per cent annual rate, further
moderate growth in output over the near term would not appear to
strain operating rates. In particular, capacity in the materials-
producing industries seems generally adequate with utilization rates
for most industries well below previous highs. Regional shortages have
appeared, however, in the building materials area--particularly cement
and gypsum wallboard--and these may have delayed some construction
projects.

Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Gains in employment coupled with large wage increases have
been the main support to income growth thus far in 1978. In an environ-
ment of more rapid inflation, however, real income growth has averaged
only a 2 per cent annual rate--about half of that in 1977. In July,
private wage and salary disbursements in nominal terms advanced at a
$10.2 billion annual rate, comparable to the gains in the first six
months of the year. In addition, total personal income in July was
boosted by the annual cost-of-living increase in Social Security benefits
as well as a step-up in rent and proprietors' income due to California
property tax reductions. Income gains apparently were smaller in
August as employment growth slowed and wage increases moderated.
After registering large gains early this spring, retail sales
have been sluggish in recent months. Excluding autos and mainly non-
consumption items, total retail sales in nominal terms rose .3 per
cent in August and were only 1.1 per cent above the second quarter
average. Sales at general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and
appliance stores as a group edged down in August for the third successive
month. Total auto sales, however, were strong again in August. Sales
of domestic units were at a 9.8 million annual rate; for July and
August, sales averaged 9.4 million units at an annual rate, only 6
per cent below the near-record second quarter pace. Sales of foreign
models rose to a 2.1 million unit rate in August perhaps partly because
earlier adjustments to exchange rate movements have been partially offset

by Detroit's new pricing strategy of numerous small price adjustments
during the model year.
Sales of autos and other consumer durable goods have generally
continued at a high level with consumer surveys suggesting widespread
buying in advance of anticipated further price increases. By its
nature, such support tends to be transitory; indeed, the Michigan
survey for August indicated that favorable evaluations of the market
conditions for buying autos dropped sharply last month and that fewer
consumers reported buy-in-advance motives. Moreover, the composite
index of consumer sentiment declined significantly. In contrast to
the Michigan results, the Conference Board index of confidence edged
up slightly in August, continuing in the general range of the last
2-1/2 years but well below the level seen in early 1978.
Residential Construction
Total home sales rose fractionally in July to a level only
slightly belowthe peak rate of late 1977, despite relatively tight
mortgage market conditions. Total private housing starts, at a 2.1
million unit annual rate in July, were down only slightly from June. Some
weakening has been evident in the single-family sector, where starts
have now declined for three successive months. While multifamily
starts also edged down in July, they remained well above the year-earlier
level. Although these starts have recently been bolstered by HUD's
Section 8 rental assistance program and various GNMA tandem plans,
non-assisted units continued to account for a large and fairly stable
share of the multifamily sector.

Business Investment
Incoming data indicate that growth in capital spending is
likely to slow in the near term, with gains concentrated in the
construction area. The Commerce Department August survey of plant
and equipment spending indicates that business again has raised its plans
for the year and now expects a 12.3 per cent nominal increase in 1978.
The second quarter increase was larger than business had anticipated
earlier; planned growth of spending over the latter half of the year
was little changed. If the latest plans are realized, nominal capital
spending growth will decelerate to an 11 per cent annual rate over
the second half of 1978 after recording a 19 per cent gain over the
first half. Historically, this survey has been quite accurate, over-
estimating the eventual increase by only small amounts in seven of the
past eight years.
Recent appropriations data also suggest that the growth in
capital outlays will slow. Manufacturers' newly approved capital
appropriations, which on average lead outlays by about a year, fell
18 per cent in the second quarter after having been on a relatively high
plateau for the previous three quarters (see appropriations chart).
Declines were indicated in 12 of the 17 industry groups for which data
are reported.
Additional evidence is provided by the trend of new orders for
nondefense capital goods which have shown little strength recently.
Such bookings fell 8.0 per cent in July and were at their lowest level

since January. The weakness in July reflected a sharp drop in the
volatile commercial aircraft component. The machinery component of
these orders, a good indicator of the underlying trend in the demand
for equipment, has been virtually flat for six months. Reflecting
the recent softness in orders, shipments were unchanged in July and
backlogs of unfilled orders declined for the first time in nearly a
year.
In contrast to capital equipment, considerable strength continues
to be evident in the construction area. The value of private nonresidential
construction put-in-place edged up in July, after rising at a 43 per
cent annual rate in the first half of the year. Moreover, awards of
nonresidential construction contracts almost doubled in July, after
dropping sharply in June. While this series has been very volatile
from month to month, it generally has been much stronger this year than
last. The rise in contract awards for commercial buildings and
manufacturing plants has been particularly impressive.
Nonfarm business inventory investment slowed somewhat in June
and appears to be slowing further in July, judging from reports on manu-
facturing and wholesale trade. The book value of manufacturers'
inventories rose at a $16.4 billion annual rate in July, less than the
rapid pace of the second quarter but comparable to the still brisk
pace of the first quarter. The July increase in stocks was accompanied
by a 1.4 per cent decline in shipments and the book value inventory
to sales ratio in manufacturing rose to 1.55, above the second quarter
but still low on an historical basis.

Wholesale trade inventories declined at a $7.9 billion
annual rate in July following a $11.8 billion increase in the second
quarter. In this sector, the inventory to sales ratio edged down.
(See Appendix A for a more detailed discussion of the current inventory
situation.)
Government Sector Activity
In the Federal sector, unified budget outlays were about $1.5
billion lower in July than expected by the staff and Administration.
Although preliminary data indicate that some of the July shortfall may
have been recouped in August, Federal spending in FY 1978 will likely
be about $2 to $3 billion below the Administration's July estimate of
$452.3 billion. Incoming data on receipts suggest that the Administration
revenue estimate of $401 billion probably will be realized. Thus the
resulting deficit for the current fiscal year is likely to be around
$48 billion.
The Second Concurrent Budget Resolutions for FY 1979 passed by
the House and Senate imply deficits in the $40-42 billion range, well
below the $48-1/2 billion deficit estimated by the Administration in
July. These resolutions allow for tax cuts ranging from $12 billion to
$15 billion for FY 1979. Final action on the budget totals is expected
by September 15 when the Congress sets binding receipt and outlay ceilings
for the coming fiscal year.
State and local government construction expenditures have
continued to increase sharply. The value of construction put-in-place

by States and localities in July was 2 per cent above the upward-revised
June level. As the following chart shows, the record level of construc-
tion spending in July is almost 25 per cent above that of a year ago.
However, employment by States and localities fell in August
for the second month in a row. The cutbacks were concentrated in
educational employment, suggesting that much of the decline probably
was due to the downward trend in school enrollments. The effects of
Proposition 13 in California also may have been a factor.
Prices and Wages
As expected, recent price data show considerable improvement
in the food category. After rising at an 18-1/2 per cent annual rate
during the first half of 1978, retail food prices leveled off in July
in part due to a sizable decline in meat prices. In addition, producer
price data for August indicate declines for both crude materials for
food and finished foods. Prices were lower for grains, coffee, poultry,
and livestock, with the latter decline somewhat greater than expected.
At the finished level, prices fell sharply for fresh fruits, vegetables
and eggs, while beef prices continued to decline at the rapid July rate.
Excluding food, consumer prices rose at an 8 per cent annual
rate in July--close to the average rate recorded in the first half of
1978. Energy items rose less than in June due to a decline in electricity
rates which had been climbing rapidly for 5 months. There was also some
moderation for other commodities due largely to declining apparel prices.

II -19
However, in the service area, increasing house prices and home financing
costs continued to keep pressure on the overall consumer price level.
Producer prices for finished nonfood items increased moderately
in August following earlier bursts associated with sharp increases for
cars, trucks, and jewelry. Producer prices for consumer finished goods
excluding food rose 0.4 per cent in August. A decline in truck prices
slowed the rise in capital equipment to 0.4 per cent in August. Inter-
mediate materials prices accelerated somewhat because of rises in steel
mill products and in construction materials, while crude nonfood materials
prices declined somewhat in August following two months of very large
increases.
Wage rates as measured by the hourly earnings index were little
changed in August after increasing sharply in July. So far this year,
this measure of wages has advanced at just over an 8 per cent annual
rate--about 1/2 percentage point faster than over 1977. There have been
particularly large increases in trade wages this year, reflecting in
part the large minimum wage adjustment. In addition, there has been a
significant acceleration in construction wages, which has accompanied
this year's burst of nonresidential building activity.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Credit flows remained strong in August. Bond issuance by States
and localities was especially large, as borrowing to finance new projects
continued at about the pace of other recent months and was augmented by
a record level of refunding activity. Proceeds from the refundings were
channeled into nonmarketable Treasury debt, and the Treasury also issued
a substantial volume of marketable debt over the month. Mortgage formation
apparently accelerated a little in August, and preliminary indications
also suggest that expansion of consumer instalment debt picked up a bit
in August after dropping off in July. The pace of business borrowing in
short-term credit markets slipped in August, but public bond offerings
by nonfinancial corporations were somewhat above the depressed pace of
earlier this year.
M-l grew more rapidly in August than in the preceding two
months, and inflows of savings and consumer-type time deposits at
banks and thrift institutions accelerated. Banks and thrifts continued
to supplement these deposits with other sources of funds, although to a
lesser extent than in the preceding month.
The rally in credit markets that began in late July ended during
the early part of August. Short-term interest rates began rising just prior
to the August FOMC meeting. Then after the meeting, the System's policy
actions--the 50-basis-point hike in the discount rate and a rise in the
Federal funds rate of about the same amount--placed additional pressures on
short-termyields. Short-term market rates generally have advanced 50 to 75

basis points since theAugust FOMC meeting. Long-term yields, on the other
hand, have shown little reaction either to the tightening in system policy
or to the heavy calendar of noncorporate issues. The lack of response in
bond markets appears to reflect the presence of some sentiment that, in light
of the moderating of economic activity, long-term interest rates maybe near
their peaks for the current expansion.
Monetary Aggregates
Growth of the monetary aggregates accelerated in August to a
7-1/2 per cent annual rate for M-1 and to a 10-1/2 per cent rate for M-2.
During June and July, M-1 had expanded at an average rate of 5-3/4 per cent,
and M-2 at slightly more than 8 per cent. This earlier slowdown of monetary
expansion appears in part to have reflected the transitory effects of a
much greater than seasonal increase in Treasury deposits and a contra-
seasonal decline in foreign official and foreign commercial bank balances.
In August the effects of these movements dissipated.
Time and savings deposits included in M-2 expanded in August at
their most rapid rate in more than a year; a sharp further advance in large-
denomination deposits included in this aggregate accounted for nearly half
of this total growth. Small time deposit growth abated, perhaps signaling
a tapering off at commercial banks of the major stock adjustment to the
new money market certificate. Savings deposits rose moderately in August,
following two months of decline. Since short-term market interest rates
continue to be well above the ceiling rate on bank savings deposits, this
is a puzzling and probably temporary phenomenon; the growth could reflect
a changing seasonal pattern to the series.

Survey results available only for S&Ls indicate that the
6-month money market certificate attracted a sizable volume of deposits
during August--albeit at a slower pace than in the previous two months.
Inflows to the certificates totaled about $3 billion, as compared to
sales in the $5 to $6 billion range in June and July. Separate estimates
for time and savings deposits at thrift institutions are not available
for August, but in June and July S&L savings deposits declined while time
deposit growth was extremely high.
Sales of the money market certificates contributed importantly
to the continuation of the rapid growth of total deposits at S&Ls in
August, which expanded at about a 15-1/2 per cent annual rate. The recent
increased deposit flows, as well as reduced mortgage lending, enabled
S&Ls to increase their holdings of liquid assets in July, the most recent
month of data. Following ten months of decline, the liquidity ratio of
insured S&Ls increased to 8.7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Deposits at mutual savings banks grew at about an 8 per cent rate during
August, and combined thrift deposit growth is estimated to have been
about 13-1/2 per cent last month, the highest since October 1977.
Despite rising market interest rates, both banks and S&Ls are
experiencing relatively rapid growth in total liabilities. The strategy of
commercial banks to maintain growth of liabilities is illustrated in the
chart on page III-6. Since mid-1977, savings and small time deposits have
declined as a per cent of total financial liabilities, in association
with the cyclical increase in market yields above maximum rates payable

on deposits subject to Regulation Q.1 Over this period, bank reliance
on managed liabilities has increased; the share of total liabilities
accounted for by these money market instruments is only about two
percentage points less than at the cyclical peak in the third quarter
of 1974.
The composition of liabilities at thrift institutions has
changed only mildly over the last year compared to that of commercial
banks. But as shown in the chart on page 111-8, the relaxation of
ceiling rates on time deposits through authorization of the 6-month
money market certificate has already resulted in a visible rise in
the proportion of S&L liabilities accounted for by time deposits.
Advances from the FHLBs as a proportion of liabilities have risen in
typical cyclical fashion in recent months, but the proportion is still
well below the highs of late 1974 and early 1975. The increasing use
of funds that bear essentially market rates of interest is tending
to raise the average cost of funds to S&Ls.
Bank Credit
The recent monthly pattern of growth in commercial bank
credit, which surged in July and dropped in August, was significantly
distorted by a similar pattern in System-matched sale-purchase agree-
ments which gave rise to volatile movements in security loans.
1/ Yields on market securities generally have been above Regulation
Q ceilings throughout the maturity range--except for the new 8-
year instrument--since the fourth quarter of 1977.

acceptances slowed to a 9-3/4 per cent annual rate of growth in
August, but real estate lending showed another large increase.
Small banks liquidated a substantial volume of Treasury
securities as their lending expanded rapidly. Despite sizable security
acquisitions by large banks in the Treasury's mid-quarter refunding
in August, bank investments on balance declined by nearly $1 billion
last month--the only decline since March.
Business Credit
The financing gap of nonfinancial businesses is estimated
to be narrowing during the current quarter, and business borrowing in
short- and intermediate-term financial markets has decelerated notice-
ably over the summer. During the first five months of the year, business
loans at commercial banks (net of holdings of bankers acceptances) grew
at a 21-1/2 per cent annual rate, but since the end of May such lending
has grown at only half that rate.2 Commercial paper issuance and business
loans from finance companies have only partially made up the difference.
At the same time, nonfinancial corporations' gross public offerings of
bonds--although picking up somewhat since mid-year--have remained at a
relatively low level.
2/ On the August Lending Practices Survey, discussed in detail in an
appendix there was a sharp decline in the proportion of lending
officers at responding banks reporting stronger business loan
demand.

Business loan growth at New York money center banks was compara-
tively strong in late August and may partly explain a slight contraction
in nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding. Also, several large
utilities were reported to have paid down their paper indebtedness with the
proceeds of capital market financings. Total business borrowing from banks
and the commercial paper market grew at an 8-1/2 per cent rate in August,
well below the pace during July. Commercial paper issued by financial
businesses, including bank holding companies, also contracted in August,
and total commercial paper experienced its largest monthly decline in
over a year.
Business lending by finance companies slowed further in July,
the most recent monthly data available. The 7 per cent rate of increase
was the lowest since last fall. With automobile dealer inventories
declining further, the wholesale auto category continued to be an area
of weakness in lending at finance companies.
In the capital market, about $1.3 billion of nonfinancial cor-
porations' bonds were offered to the public in August, the same as in
July. Public bond offerings by financial concerns were reduced sharply
in August, paring the total slate of new issues to $1.5 billion. Since
the August FOMC meeting, major stock price indexes have risen to their
highest levels of the year. Stock offerings increased to $600 million
in August, with new common and preferred stock issues by public utili-
ties accounting for about one-half of the total. The number of new stock
issues by small industrial concerns also has ben larger in recent

months, in part due to their stronger stock price performances
as indicated by the relatively greater rise in the ASE and NASDAQ
indexes than in NYSE indexes.
Government Finance
New issues of tax-exempt bonds surged to a record $6.1 billion
in August. The increase in offerings resulted in part from a rush to
market advance refunding bonds before the September 1 effective date
of IRS and Treasury rulings that reduced the attractiveness of such opera-
tions.3  However, a large volume of new money issues also was offered
during the month. With the heavy August calendar, yields on municipal
bonds have edged up since the last FOMC meeting.
The Treasury raised an unusually large amount of new cash
through sales of nonmarketable securities in August--about $4.9 billion.
An extraordinarily large volume of special arbitrage bonds--$3.2 billion--
was issued to State and local Governments. Foreign central banks pur-
chased another $1.4 billion of nonmarketable issues, with the Swiss
accounting for most of this total. Treasury marketable borrowing has
amounted to about $3.4 billion since mid-August, all in the coupon
sector, except for $500 million of new cash raised in the regular
monthly auction of 52-week bills in mid-August. For the third quarter
3/ New Treasury procedures pertaining to municipal debt offerings include
the penalty of revocation of the tax-exempt status of outstanding issues
that do not strictly conform to regulations. Formerly, the most severe
penalty applied was not granting tax exemption to subsequent bond offer-
ings by the issuer. Also effective September 1 was a change in IRS regu-
lations regarding the administrative costs of issuers of arbitrage
bonds that will directly raise the effective cost of issuance of such
bonds.

III -15
as a whole, the Treasury is expected to raise about $9.4 billion
of new cash in the market (on a settlement date basis)--over $1.6
billion in the form of security sales to foreign accounts. Largely
as a result of the unexpectedly large volume of nonmarketable securi-
ties sold in August, the Treasury is expected to end the quarter
with a cash balance close to $20 billion (not seasonally adjusted).
The recent rise in yields on short- and intermediate-term
Treasury securities has had mixed impacts on noncompetitive tenders
in Treasury auctions. In most regular Treasury bill auctions, non-
competitive tenders generally have remained below levels recorded
in auctions earlier in the year; this very likely reflects the
introduction of the 6-month certificate at banks and thrift insti-
tutions. On the other hand, total noncompetitive tenders in coupon
auctions amounted to almost $3 billion in August--primarily accounted
for by the large amount of such tenders in the mid-quarter refunding.
During the month of August, total sponsored agency borrowing
amounted to $2.9 billion on a settlement basis. For the quarter to
date, their borrowing has been about $5 billion, somewhat below the
pace of the second quarter. The Federal housing agencies continue
to account for the major part of agency borrowing, as the needs of
farm credit agencies remain moderate.
Mortgage Markets
Owing in part to the relative success of the new certificate
in maintaining overall deposit flows at thrift institutions, pressures
in the mortgage market have apparently eased somewhat in recent weeks.

III -16
While about three-fifths of the S&Ls continued to report supplies of
mortgage funds below normal seasonal patterns, the proportion reporting
funds in substantially short supply has dropped to one-sixth from as
high as one-third in early June. Reflecting a 25-basis-point reduction
in rates in the West, average interest rates on new commitments for
conventional home mortgages at sampled S&Ls have edged down since the
last FOMC meeting. In the secondary markets, average yields have fallen
moderately since mid-August.
Aggregate mortgage loan volume in August apparently picked up
somewhat from the pace of other recent months. Real estate loans at
commercial banks continued to grow rapidly, increasing by an estimated
$3.5 billion. Issues of GNMA-guaranteed securities rose to $1.6 billion
from the $1.0 billion rates of June and July, although FNMA purchases
of FHA/VA mortgages were below the average rate of recent months. Net
mortgage acquisitions by S&Ls--which in July were one-third below the
peaks of late 1977 and the lowest in 2 years--probably recovered some-
what in August, given the substantial rebound in funds flows in recent
months. The chart on page III-18 shows the close but lagged relationship
between funds flows at S&Ls and their mortgage lending. Mortgage
commitments outstanding at S&Ls were about unchanged in July, following
six consecutive months of decline, as new commitment activity held near
the improved June pace.
Spreads between the primary yields on conventional mortgages
and yields on high-grade bonds have been relatively wide in recent
months and have provided an incentive for diversified lenders to invest

available funds in home mortgages. Mortgages have continued to account
for sizable shares of lending by commercial and mutual savings banks,
and some life insurance companies reportedly have increased their
acquisitions of home loans.
Consumer Finance
Consumer instalment credit increased during July at a 17
per cent annual rate, somewhat below the unusually strong advance
during the second quarter. The slower growth rate, relative to the
second quarter, reflected declining total credit extensions while
credit liquidations expanded slightly. Weekly reporting bank data
and retail sales figures suggest only a small pick-up in consumer
credit growth during August.
There have been a few signs recently that households may
be experiencing greater difficulty in meeting expanded debt repay-
ment obligations. The percentage of delinquent new and used automo-
bile contracts at finance companies has risen fairly steadily since
early 1976, although it remains substantially below previous highs.
The number of personal bankruptcies filed during the second quarter
rose 9 per cent, slightly exceeding the 1977 quarterly average level.
Between February and May, average delinquency rates at leading retail
firms increased relative to year-earlier levels for the first time
in more than two years, but the increases were modest. On the other
hand, a sizable first quarter gain in the more inclusive delinquency

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. In the five weeks since the last green
book exchange rates fluctuated over a very wide rang. At the beginning of
the period the dollar was under heavy selling pressure and by mid-August the
average exchange value of the dollar had fallen about 9 per cent below its
value in late May. This decline was sharply reversed by President Carter's
statement of concern over the dollar's fall on August 16. Subsequent
announcements of an increase in the Federal Reserve's discount rate and
stepped-up Treasury gold sales gave added impetus to the dollar's recovery
and by August 29 the average exchange value of the dollar had risen about
3-1/2 per cent from its mid-August low point. However, the dollar's recovery
was abruptly halted by the announcement of a substantial increase in the
U.S. trade deficit for July. In reaction to this announcement the dollar's
average exchange value fell back by nearly 1-1/2 per cent. So far in
September exchange rate movements have shown little trend with rates
fluctuating erratically. The current volatility of exchange rates appears
to reflect market uncertainty over possible additional U.S. policy measures
to stabilize the dollar, U.S. energy policy--particularly the fate of the
natural gas bill--and future trends in U.S. inflation and payments deficits.
Despite the wide range over which exchange rates fluctuated over
the past five weeks, the dollar's average exchange value is currently little
changed from its level of 5 weeks ago. The weighted-average exchange value
of the dollar has increased by about 1/2 per cent over this 5 week period,
including appreciations of 2 per cent against the Japanese yen and about
1/2 per cent against the mark and other Europe currencies.

The currency with the greatest net change against the dollar
over this period was the Canadian dollar, which depreciated by a further
2-1/2 per cent, dropping to a record low below 86 U.S. cents. The Canadian
dollar has experienced periods of heavy selling pressure ever since the
election of the Seperatist Party in Quebec in November 1976, and in the
nearly two years since then the average exchange value of the Canadian
dollar has fallen by over 25 per cent. The most recent decline in the
Canadian currency was triggered by the announcement of a worsening of the
Canadian trade balance in July. The subsequent announcement of an increase
in the Bank of Canada's discount rate from 9 to 9-1/2 per cent had little
exchange market impact.
.At times over the past month both the Belgian franc and
Danish krone fell to their lower fluctuation limits against the German mark

On several occasions when the dollar was under downward pressure
over the past 5 weeks the Desk intervened, making total sales of $450 million
equivalent of marks. These mark sales were financed by equal swap drawings by
the System and the Treasury. On August 11 the Desk purchased $200 million

the System's outstanding swap drawings on the Bundesbank stand at $685

Swiss National Bank totaling $60 million equivalent to finance intervention
sales of Swiss francs over the past 5 weeks, raising outstanding current
drawings of Swiss francs to $82 million equivalent.
The gold price reached a high above $215 at mid-August, fell back
as the dollar started to recover on exchange markets, and fell sharply
further to below $200 in reaction to the Treasury's announcement of expanded
gold auctions. Subsequently, gold has moved back up to around $208, near
its level of 5 weeks ago.

U.S. International Transactions. In July, the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit was $41 billion at an annual rate,
considerably above the rates for June and the second quarter. Private
net capital flows for which we have data showed a $600 million out-
flow (adjusted). Official foreign assets in the United States
(excluding OPEC) increased by more than $3 billion in July, but
have risen at a slower pace more recently as intervention activity
has been reduced.

The enlargment of the trade deficit in July, relative to
June and the second quarter, was largely accounted for by a surge in
the volume of nonpetroleum imports.

NOTE: Details may not add to totals because of rounding.
Nonpetroleum imports in July increased sharply from the
second-quarter rate, with volume up sharply and prices up moderately.
Capital goods imports showed the largest increase in July over the
second quarter rate. Both steel and car imports also rose sub-

IV -8
stantially. Most of the increase in steel imports and all of the
increase in car imports came in shipments from Western Europe.
Imports of petroleum in July remained at about the rate
in the first half of 1978, a rate about 9 per cent below that of
1977. The drop in petroleum imports this year reflects stock draw-
down and an increase in U.S. oil production. The average cost of a
barrel of oil imported in July was $13.25, compared with $13.24 in
the second quarter, and $13.31 in the first quarter.
The value of nonagricultural exports in July rose by 1
per cent over the second-quarter rate. Higher prices of nonagri-
cultural exports more than accounted for the increase, with volumes
lower than in the second quarter. Coal exports, affected by a
railroad strike that began in early July,fell.
The value of agricultural exports declined in July by
6 per cent from the second-quarter rate. The decline was almost
entirely accounted for by a fall in the volume and value of soy-
bean shipments. The fall in export prices for soybeans -- $6.87
per bushel in July compared with $7.38 per bushel in June --
reflected the earlier decline in the spot price for soybeans.
Bank-reported private capital transactions, adjusted for
reporting bias, resulted in a net inflow of $1.1 billion in July.
The inflow was accounted by a borrowing of funds by U.S. banks from
their foreign branches and by a shift in the World Bank's liquid
asset portfolio out of U.S. Treasury securities and into money market
placements with domestic banks.

IV -9
Foreign private net sales of U.S. corporate stocks
amounted to $50 million in July. By contrast, in the second quarter
foreign private investors purchased (net) $1 billion in U.S. corporate
stocks.
In July, foreign official assets in the United States
(excluding OPEC holdings) increased by more than $3 billion.
.In August,
foreign official holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
increased by $1.5 billion.
OPEC banking and security holdings in the United States
increased by $200 million in July, following a $2.6 billion decline
in the second quarter. In August, OPEC holdings at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York fell by $700 million.

IV -10
Foreign Economic Developments. Latest developments present a
stronger picture of current and prospective economic activity in the
major foreign countries than was the case a month ago. Nevertheless,
evidence of strength remains spotty and the outlook continues to be
for only a moderate step up in growth rates in the remainder of 1978 and
in 1979.
Perhaps the most significant development for this outlook is
the proposed supplementary budget in Japan. This budget is designed to
raise the growth rate of Japanese GNP in the current fiscal year by 1.3
percentage points, to reach the 7 per cent growth target. To have these
effects, however, implementation would have to be quicker than is likely.
The German stimulus package proposed in July -- after the Bonn Summit --
is encountering political obstacles and is less likely to be approved in
its original form than is the Japanese package; even if approved in full
the package is smaller than the Japanese one. Moreover, demand in
Germany, unlike in Japan, appears to have been quite weak in the first
half of this year, although revised data for industrial production in
June and provisional data for July suggest a resurgence of output.
Among the other major countries, activity was relatively strong
during the second quarter in Canada and the United Kingdom but quite weak in
France and Italy.
Differences in the strength of demand in various countries seems
to have been reflected to some extent in the pattern of current-account
balances. Thus, the weakness of demand in Italy and France helps to

IV -11
explain the continuing and surprising strength of their external
accounts. Conversely, the strong domestic demand in Canada and
Britain in the second quarter may account in part for the unexpected
weakness of their trade accounts. In Germany and Japan, despite rela-
tively strong growth of import volume -- reflecting in part the first
effects of exchange-rate appreciation -- surpluses have increased as
their terms of trade have improved. (See the discussion of trade
volumes, below.)
Inflation rates in the major foreign countries generally re-
main below the rates experienced prior to the end of last year. Con-
sumer prices actually fell in the latest month in Germany and Japan, but
in some other countries -- and in the six major foreign countries
combined -- inflation rates in the second quarter began to edge higher
again.
Notes on individual countries. At the beginning of September,
the Japanese Cabinet approved a 2.5 trillion yen supplementary budget
program (about $13 billion equivalent) that is intended to raise real
GNP by 1.3 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 1979. (The new
program is expected to be presented to the Diet for approval in mid-
September.) Slightly over half of the new expenditures will be for
national public works and housing loans. Japanese authorities now
forecast that the new package will allow them to meet the official
target of 7 per cent real GNP growth in the current fiscal year.

The forecast relies on additional increases in private invest-
ment to offset expected declines in net exports. However, private fixed
investment increased by only 1-1/2 per cent in the April-June quarter
and has shown no sign of a resurgence on the scale required by the
official forecast. Moreover, reports have indicated that a relatively
small issue of bonds (about ¥300 billion) is expected in connection with
the program and that the government may cut back on other current-account
expenditures. Recourse to the latter means of "financing" the new package
would, of course, reduce its net impact on final demand.
In Germany, provisional figures released last week show that
industrial production rose 3-1/2 per cent from June to July (seasonally
adjusted, monthly rate), with output of capital goods being especially
strong. At the same time, the figure for June was revised upward from 1
per cent to 2-1/2 per cent. Given the volatility of this series, these
new data are difficult to interpret. There have been few other signs
that the German economy is breaking out of the pattern of slow growth.
The only sector showing strong recovery was construction, which grew by
5.5 per cent in 1978Q2 after 21 months of stagnation. This was offset
by the continued slump in fixed investment and the indifferent performance
of private and public consumption.
Real GNP in Canada increased in real terms by over 1 per cent
(seasonally adjusted) during the second quarter of 1978. Final domestic
demand -- which has been sluggish since early 1977 -- rose by almost 2
per cent. The advance in domestic demand was the result of a strong re-
surgence in gross fixed capital formation and continued moderate growth

IV -16
of personal expenditure and government current expenditure on goods and
services. Contributing to the 5 per cent rise in gross fixed capital
formation was a 10 per cent rise in machinery and equipment investment
and a 5 per cent rise in residential construction. Recent surveys con-
tinue to indicate an improvement in businessmen's attitude.
At the end of August, Canadian Finance Minister Chretien
announced a series of economic proposals that include a cut in family
allowances, offset by a new tax credit for low- and middle-income earners;
a cut in unemployment insurance benefits coupled with a job creation
program; and the deregulation of natural gas prices.
Effective September 12, the Bank of Canada raised its discount
rate from 9.0 to 9.5 per cent. At the same time, the Bank announced that
its target for the trend rate of growth of M1 has been lowered from 7-11 to
6-10 per cent, based on a new base of June 1978. In the 12 months to
June 1978 M1 rose 8-1/2 per cent.
There has been a pickup in economic activity in the United
Kingdom in recent months. Private consumer spending has been particularly
strong, rising almost 2-1/2 per cent (seasonally adjusted, not annual rate)
from 1977Q4 to 1978Q2. Fixed investment in manufacturing industries in-
creased by less than 1 per cent. There was a substantial increase in in-
ventories during the first two quarters of 1978. (The second quarter data
on consumption and investment are provisional.)
The economic recovery in Italy appears to have flattened out in
the second quarter as evidenced by a drop in industrial production. The
government is in the process of preparing a three-year economic program

IV -17
which has as one of its objectives a reduction in the public-sector-
deficit's share of GDP and which would necessitate significant
spending cuts and tax increases. For 1978, however, the extended-
public-sector deficit will far outrun the original government target
because of the failure to adopt the necessary implementing measures.
The sluggish recovery has contributed to a very strong external position
and in the first six months the trade balance (customs basis, seasonally
adjusted) recorded a surplus of $440 million in contrast to a deficit of
$2.5 billion for the full year 1977; heavy tourist receipts have also
contributed to upward pressure on the lira. The Bank of Italy has
accumulated a substantial amount of foreign exchange, a part of which
has been used to repay about $4 billion of official external debt. On
September 1 the Bank of Italy announced a reduction in the basic discount
rate from 11.5 to 10.5 per cent. The move appears to reflect the sub-
stantial liquidity presently enjoyed by the banking system.
In France, the government's post-election policy of maintaining
the real wages of low-income earners -- by raising minimum wages in line
with price increases -- has resulted in large increases in nominal wages.
The index of hourly wages rose 5 per cent in the second quarter of 1978,
yielding a year-over-year increase of almost 14 per cent.
In Denmark, the new coalition government adopted a variety of
measures designed to moderate the rising fiscal deficit and to preserve
the recent reduction in the current-account deficit. Meanwhile, a
scheme to stimulate private savings is to be introduced this autumn in
Sweden. Indications are that wage and salary earners will be allowed

IV -18
to deposit annually up to about $1,000 in a special account. Twenty
per cent of these savings, as well as interest earned on the entire
account, will be tax deductible.
In Switzerland, Ebauches Electroniques, the major manufacturer
of electronic watch components, closed for one week in August and will be
running on a 4 day week for the indefinite future. This company was
thought to be the cutting edge of the Swiss competition against growing
exports of American and Japanese watches. Forty per cent of Swiss export
companies foresee a decline in export orders, according to a recent
Union Bank of Switzerland survey; shares of Swiss industrial corporations
are down 5 per cent since the end of 1977 and continue weak against the
general market.
Trade volume. The rates of growth of import volumes over the
latest four quarters in Canada, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom --
where weighted-average exchange rates have depreciated -- have slackened
relative to the previous four quarters and to the growth rate of export
volumes in each country (see table). There was a spurt in Canadian
imports in the second quarter of this year due to a sharp increase in
real domestic demand. Because British trade data have fluctuated widely
in recent months, it is difficult to interpret the large increase in
imports in the first quarter. However, to some extent it may reflect
speculative inventory building during a period when sterling was rela-
tively strong and expected to decline.

In contrast to generally weak import volumes elsewhere, in
Germany and Japan -- where weighted-average exchange rates have
appreciated -- import volumes have increased at faster rates than
in the preceding year, and much faster than their exports this year.
Strong exports of Japanese steel and other products in anticipation of
the imposition of new trade restrictions produced a first quarter 1978
bulge in Japanese export volume that was followed by a steep decline
during the second quarter. These events interrupted a history of
relatively flat Japanese exports dating back to early 1977.
Only in those countries experiencing the greatest exchange
rate appreciation, Germany and Japan, have import volumes increased
faster than export volumes. In comparing trade in those two countries
it is striking that despite recent periods of relatively low growth of
German domestic demand and the greater appreciation of the yen, German
imports increased at a faster rate than those of Japan.
In the context of recent exchange rate developments, the
surplus trade balances currently shown by both Germany and Japan more
strongly reflect recent improvements in their terms of trade rather than
increases in the ratio of export volume to import volume.

APPENDIX A
RECENT INVENTORY DEVELOPMENTS
So far this expansion has been generally free of the sharp
buildup in inventory investment that frequently interrupt cycles and
sometimes terminate them prematurely. Nevertheless, the longevity of
the present expansion period, together with an outlook for moderating
growth, makes it difficult to envision activity over the near term
without the development of some inventory excesses. The purpose of
this appendix is to provide an over-all appraisal of the adequacy
of stocks of nonfarm business with an aim toward assessing the possi-
bility of inventory corrections occurring in the very near term. The
first section summarizes the behavior of inventories in the current
expansion. The second section takes a critical look at apparent inven-
tory positions and trends by examining alternative conceptualizations
of the inventory-sales ratio. The next section discusses a few trouble
spots that may be masked by movements in aggregate ratios, and a final
section draws implications for the near term inventory outlook.
Recent Perspective
Although initially characterized by a relatively deep and
lengthy correction, the behavior of aggregate inventories during the
current expansion has not been remarkably different from that of prior
recovery periods. Following the recession, excess stocks were worked
off by the end of 1975, and since then the inventory sales ratio--in
real terms--has shown little perceptible movement (Chart 1). Nonethe-
less, the ratio of real nonfarm inventory investment to GNP as of
1978:QII stood at 0.95 per cent, well above the 0.66 per cent postwar
average. For expansions that have been especially durable it is not
uncommon for inventories to rise as a share of output; in particular,
the current ratio of inventory investment to GNP is only a bit below
the corresponding ratio during the 1960's. Furthermore, at this point
in the current expansion, there has been less cumulative building of
real nonfarm inventories than that which occurred throughout the com-
parable period in the 60's.
In recent months--until June, manufacturing and trade book
value inventory investment has been unusually strong. Boosted in large
part by accelerating inflation, inventory investment in the first

quarter was the largest since the end of 1974, paced in part by record
accumulation at wholesale trade establishments. The second quarter
pace continued high, with gains about equally divided between manu-
facturing and trade. In June, however, there was a distinct slowing
of accumulation at retail trade establishments. In July, the manu-
facturing sector increase was the smallest in six months and wholesale
stocks declined for the first time in a year.
Inventory-Sales Ratios
The inventory-sales ratio has behaved in a fairly coincident
fashion over the business cycle. Historically, it has increased during
recessions and later declined when businesses worked off overhangs as
sales picked up. Sharp movements in the ratio are explained more by
variations in sales than by swings in stocks. While the book value
ratio is probably the most frequently used indicator of stock adequacy,
movements in this ratio can be and have been distorted in an environ-
ment of persistent inflation.
The Book Value Ratio. In June the book value ratio of total
manufacturing and trade inventories to sales was near its Korean War
low; as Chart 2 shows, it has been trending downward fairly steadily
since its recession peak in 1975. By sector, the book value ratio is
extremely low in manufacturing--particularly in the machinery, trans-
portation equipment, textile, and tobacco industries. However, inven-
tories held by wholesalers and retailers appear to be generally in line
with their sales, although some build-ups have emerged at retailers of
apparel, furniture and appliances and at general merchandise stores.
Even though the book value ratios suggest stocks are fairly
lean, these ratios may actually be understating the adequacy of current
stocks for two reasons: first, inflation affects sales more than it
does stocks since the latter reflect a mix of current and historical
prices; and second, the type of inventory accounting procedures pre-
ferred by firms tends to place an increasing emphasis on valuation of
stocks at historical as opposed to current prices.l/ The degree of
1/ Thile the value of sales is measured in current prices, the book
value of inventories depends on both current and historical
are typically below current market prices. Hence, the numerator in
the commonly used book value inventory-sales ratio reflects current
prices to a lesser extent than the denominator, resulting in a ratio
that is biased downward. The bias is further aggravated when increased
inflationary pressures lead firms to switch to the LIFO (last-in-first-
out) system of accounting; while this accounting method has the effect
of reducing firms' profits and taxes, it also increases the proportion
of stocks carried at past prices.

A-3
bias varies directly with the rate of price inflation and should be
allowed for to insure judicious and accurate interpretation of the
book value ratio.
The Constant Dollar Ratio. While not flawless,
the constant dollar manufacturing and trade inventory-sales ratio2/
is free of the two inflation-induced biases mentioned above. On a
constant dollar basis, the inventory-sales ratio for total manufac-
turing and trade has shown less downward drift since its 1975 reces-
sion peak than has its book value counterpart (Chart 1). Furthermore,
it has remained fairly stable at about its historical average over the
last year and a half. In the manufacturing sector, while the constant
dollar ratio was a bit low at the end of the second quarter, it does
not suggest the leanness of stocks as indicated by the book value ratio.
At the end of 1978-II, the constant dollar ratio for wholesale establish-
ments appears high on a trend-adjusted basis; this contrasts with the
book value ratio which appears to be normal. At the retail trade level
the constant dollar ratio, like the book value ratio, is approximately
at its historical average.
Hence, the aggregate constant dollar ratio suggests that stocks
of manufacturers and trade establishments are about normal with respect
to sales. This is roughly confirmed by an alternative, partial
measure of inventory investment based on physical stock data; this series
indicates that real accumulation has been neither unusually high nor low
so far this year. 3
2/ Basically the construction of the constant dollar ratio requires the
conversion of book value stocks to constant (1972) dollars using
special price indexes derived from components of the Producer Price
Index, with varying treatments for the LIFO and FIFO accounting
schemes. Sales are also deflated by appropriate price indexes. This
ratio is published on a quarterly basis--in contrast to the monthly
frequency of the book value ratio--and has less industry detail than
the book value variant.
3/ This measure is a by-product of the staff's measurement of industrial
production. It includes physical stock data on trucks, autos, energy,
and factory appliances. Estimates of other inventories are derived
from production, import and consumption data for some materials, con-
sumer nondurable goods, work-in-process, and construction products.

A-4
Special Factors
Even though aggregate measures of stock adequacy indicate that
inventories are generally not out of line, major adjustments are usually
triggered by imbalances that arise at the individual industry level.
Since the end of last year, there have been a number of industries that
have exhibited special problems regarding their inventory position.
Some of the imbalances have been subsequently corrected, but in a period of
decelerating growth of over-all activity the avoidance of inventory
overhangs becomes an even greater challenge for inventory management
policies.
The GAF Group. Early this year, inventories of general merchan-
disers (including department stores) and retailers of apparel, furniture
and appliances appeared to be excessive at least as measured in book
value terms; inventory-sales ratios in these areas approached their 1974
recession levels.4/ (See Chart 3.) Some of these excess stocks were
worked off this spring and the inventory to sales ratio for the GAF group
as a whole declined sonewhat. However, retail sales at such outlets have
edged down in recent months, suggesting that this could be a
troublesome area in coming months as well.
The Coal Industry. The winter UM strike in the coal industry,
resulted in a liquidation of coal stocks at all coal burning utilities
by about 73 million tons compared to the 10 million ton decline during
the comparable four month period of the preceding winter. Although it
appeared that substantial anticipatory building occurred before the
strike, considerable restocking will still be required for this winter's
heating season. At utilities, inventories rose about 33.2 million tons
between April and June while the increase for the same period last year
was about half as much. These large increases in inventories are viewed
primarily as an effort to restock after the long strike and should not
be misconstrued as a likely source of potential imbalance.
The Automobile Industry. In the spring auto stocks at dealers
climbed to historically high levels. While the pace of sales during
those months was strong enough to support this inventory posture, fears
were expressed that this surge in demand was transitory, and thus inven-
tories could quickly turn out to be excessive. However, dealer stocks,
which peaked in April, have since declined substantially; days supply
figures suggest that, on average, dealers now should be fairly comfortable
with stocks. Thus it appears that this earlier run-up reflected recogni-
tion by producers that the upcoming model changeover period would come
earlier and take longer than usual.
4/ Constant dollar detail is not available for this category.

A-5
The Food Industry. In the food industry, erratic price move-
ments have tended to mask real relationships This was particularly true
this spring when prices for crude foodstuffs and feeds rose as rapidly
as 4.7 per cent in a single month. In March the surge of farm prices
swelled the book value of total manufacturing and trade investment in
food stocks to $18.8 billion at an annual rate, accounting for almost
30 per cent of the total manufacturing and trade book value increase.
However, the book value inventory to sales ratio at food industries, the
only one available, does not suggest any noticeable excesses (Chart 4).
Moreover, while the volatility of food stocks may at times obscure
monthly book value changes in total inventory investment, the balance
between total business stocks and sales seems to be less affected; this
is apparent in the similarity of the movement between the total inven-
tory-sales ratio and that ratio for the total excluding food (Chart 4,
lower panel).
Conclusion
Over-all measures of stock adequacy indicate that stocks are
generally in the lean to normal range. In fact, the durability of the
present cycle may in part reflect the persistence of the conservative
inventory policy that businessmen, with the 1974 experience fresh in
their minds, have been able to maintain. While special problems have
emerged in a number of industries in recent months, troublesome areas
are confined largely to retailers of general merchandise, apparel, and
furniture and appliances, whose retail sales have declined in each of
the last three months.
Near term prospects for a continued cautious inventory posture
seem to be indicated by the latest data. There was a sizable slowing in
the book value rate of total trade inventory investment for June; these
stocks rose at an annual rate of only $9.9 billion--about one-third of
the average pace over the first five months of the year. In July, the
book value increase in manufacturing inventories slowed considerably
from the second quarter average, and wholesale trade inventories declined.

APPENDIX B
SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY
ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES*
About one-half of the 121 senior loan officers responding
to the mid-August survey reported that business loan demand had
strengthened over the previous three months--a substantial decline
from the 70 to 75 per cent of respondents who reported stronger loan
demand at the time of the May survey and anticipated further strengthen-
ing from May to August. About half the panel also expected stronger
loan demand in the September-November period. Reports of rapid loan
growth were more prevalent at large banks (with assets over $5 billion),
and respondents at most of the large banks were anticipating additional
loan strength in coming months. As in the May survey, few respondents
reported that the demand for business loans had weakened in August
compared to three months earlier.
Between the May and August surveys, the prevailing prime
rate rose in three steps from 8-1/4 to 9 per cent. In this environment
of rising interest rates, many banks, particularly medium-size banks
(with assets less than $5 billion), continued to move toward firmer
terms of credit in August. Medium-size banks have acquired loan
assets relatively more rapidly than large banks in the current expan-
sion, and appear generally less liquid.
Standards of creditworthiness at both large and medium-size
respondent banks, which had already become more stringent as of May,
were tightened further by August, particularly as applied to non-prime
borrowers. A small number of banks, most of them large, reported
easier rate policies. Although very few banks changed their loan pro-
cedures for established customers, about a quarter of the reporting
banks were less inclined to approve loans from non-local service area
customers in August. One-fifth of the medium-size banks reported using
firmer criteria in August when reviewing the loan applications of new
customers, about unchanged from the May survey. In contrast, only 5
per cent of large banks reported firming criteria for this category,
down from 10 per cent in May.
About one-quarter of the respondent medium-size banks
reporting firming their compensating balance requirements for com-
mercial and industrial loans, about unchanged from the May survey.

fell slightly from the Hay to August surveys, while the number easing
rose. The large banks also showed a tendency to report more willing-
ness to make fixed-rate term loans than in May.
The number of August respondents indicating less willingness
to make loans of most types surveyed exceeded noticeably the number
indicating more willingness. This represents a further move toward
restriction compared to the May report but reflected changes in the
behavior of medium-size banks. The number of large banks reporting an
increased willingness to make loans actually rose for most loan
categories from the May report. A major exception is loans secured
by single family residences, where the position of large banks has
moved very noticeably toward restriction.
