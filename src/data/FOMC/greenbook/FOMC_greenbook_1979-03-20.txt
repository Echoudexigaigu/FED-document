Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity moderated early in the year from the brisk pace
of the last quarter of 1978, to some extent the result of adverse weather.
Retail sales have shown relatively small gains over the past two months.
Employment rose considerably further in February; however, industrial
production apparently increased only a little following virtually no gain
in the preceding month. Housing starts fell sharply in January, apparently
reflecting both the effects of severe weather on construction activity
and tighter market conditions. Indicators of business spending, however,
still show appreciable near-term strength for capital goods,and there
was a large rise in the book value of manufacturers' stocks in January.
Price increases have accelerated sharply in recent months,with especially
rapid increases reported for food, energy,and many industrial materials.
Employment and Production
Demand for labor continued strong in February,as employment at
nonfarm establishments rose 300,000--almost matching the brisk gains of
the preceding four months. Sizable increases again were reported for
retail trade, while employment in contract construction declined for a
second month. In manufacturing, employment growth continued relatively
robust. The February 75,000 increase in factory jobs was concentrated
wholly among producers of durable goods, with particularly large gains
in the machinery and transportation equipment industries. But reduced
workweeks in a number of nondurable industries resulted in a 0.1 hour
decline in the average factory workweek.

Total employment, as measured by the household survey, also
posted a large gain (350,000) in February. The unemployment rate, however,
was little changed at 5.7 per cent; during the past seven months, the
jobless rate has remained at just below 6 per cent. Most indicators are
showing relatively little labor market slack for experienced and skilled
groups such as adult men (aged 25 to 54 years) or blue-collar craft and
operative workers. Moreover, in the manufacturing sector, the average
factory workweek (40-2/3 hours) and average overtime (3-3/4 hours) have
stood at or near their 1973 peaks since the third quarter of 1978 and the
layoff rate (0.8 per hundred employees in January) has been about equal
to its 1973 low.
Industrial production apparently increased only a small amount
in February, after being little changed in January. During the fourth
quarter the monthly increases averaged 0.6 per cent. Auto assemblies
were at about an 8.9 million unit annual rate in both January and February--
off sharply from the 9.5 million rate in the fourth quarter; these lower
rates reflected some weather-related production problems as well as
reductions to assembly schedules for inventory control. Weekly data on
raw steel production suggest little change in February following a sharp
weather-related decline in the previous month, but the level of production
in the steel industry remains quite high compared to a year ago. Coal
production declined further in February.
With growth of production slowing, capacity utilization in the
manufacturing sector was little changed in both January and February.

II -4
Even so,the manufacturing utilization rate in February--at about 86 per
cent--remained only 2 percentage points below the 1973 high. Operating
rates for most materials industries showed somewhat more slack, although
utilization rates in durable goods industries such as metals have moved up
sharply during the past year.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Total personal income rose only $8 billion at an annual rate in
January following sizable gains in the three preceding months. Wage and
salary disbursements advanced at about the same pace as in November and
December, reflecting a large boost in the Federal minimum wage. However,
two special factors acted to pull down the January rise in total income:
upward adjustments in payroll taxes to finance social security, which
are deducted from the personal income totals, and a sharp drop in Govern-
ment payments to grain farmers, which were bunched in December. Reflec-
ting the relatively small rise in nominal income and an acceleration
in consumer price increases, real personal income in January fell at a
4-3/4 per cent annual rate, following three consecutive months of increases.
Consumer spending slowed early in the year from the exceptionally
strong increases of the fourth quarter. Retail sales excluding autos and
mainly nonconsumer items advanced 1.1 per cent in February, following a
0.5 per cent decline in January. February sales in real terms were
undoubtedly below the December level. Furniture and appliance sales
continued to rise rapidly in February, but a sharp drop in apparel outlays

left the GAF grouping of stores (general merchandise, apparel, and
furniture and appliance)--often an indicator of underlying consumer
demand--unchanged over the month.
Sales of domestic and foreign autos were at an 11.3 million unit
annual rate in February, slightly above the January rate and the pace for
the second half of 1978. Sales of domestic units at a 9.0 million annual
rate were little changed from the levels so far reported for the 1979 model
year, but there was a surge in small car sales. Sales of imports, at a
2.3 million unit rate, were the highest in almost 2 years. The sharp
shift in market shares in February toward more energy-efficient cars--
both domestic and foreign--probably reflected renewed concern about higher
gas prices and potential gasoline shortages.
Business Investment
Business spending commitments suggest the continued rapid growth
of capital outlays in the near-term. New orders for nondefense capital
goods increased 7.4 per cent in January to a level 5.4 per cent above the
advanced fourth quarter rate. Bookings for machinery, which are a good
reflection of the underlying demand for capital equipment, rose 3.5 per
cent in January, after an 8.8 per cent rise for the fourth quarter as a
whole. Another large increase occurred in January in the nonmachinery
area of nondefense capital goods orders, which consists mostly of aircraft
and ships.

Decisions to undertake new business building activity appear less
robust than commitments for new equipment spending. Nonresidential construc-
tion contract awards fell in January for the third month in a row from the
high October level, and the value of contracts awarded in January was
about the same as the monthly average value awarded during 1978.
Despite the continued strength of new orders, surveys of business
spending intentions still suggest a quite moderate growth in capital
spending for 1979 as a whole. The Commerce Department's February survey
of business plant and equipment spending reports that firms plan to
increase their capital expenditures 11.3 per cent in 1979, virtually
unchanged from the reading reported in January and off from the 13.3 per
cent increase in 1978. Upward revisions in spending plans were indicated
for the manufacturing sector, especially among durable goods producers,
while other sectors revised downward somewhat their earlier-expected growth
in these expenditures.
Newly approved appropriations by manufacturers, which typically
lead expenditures by three to four quarters, appear generally consistent
with recent survey results. These appropriations were up sharply in the
latter half of 1978, following a marked slowing earlier. During the four
quarters of 1978, manufacturers' appropriations rose 15-1/2 per cent, about
the same as the increase in 1977.
The book value of manufacturers' inventories rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $41 billion in January, up sharply from the moderate
$14-1/2 billion increase in December. The large January inventory investment

was accompanied by essentially unchanged shipments--probably reflecting
some weather-related delivery problems, and the ratio of inventory book
values to sales for all manufacturers edged upward in January after
falling for three consecutive months. Nonetheless, the manufacturers'
stock-sales ratio in book value terms is still low on an historical basis.
As was the case throughout most of 1978, January accumulation
by manufacturers was concentrated in durable goods. Heavy stock building
was reported by producers of both nonelectrical and electrical machinery
and transportation equipment--primarily motor vehicles and parts. The
book value of nondurable inventories also grew substantially with the
largest increases in stocks of food and rubber products, in part reflecting
recent rapid price increases.
The January accumulation at manufacturers' was the largest in
more than four years. However, the over-all rate of accumulation during
the fourth quarter was relatively low in light of the substantial strength
in final demands and, as a result, some building of stocks might be
expected early this year. Indeed, if sales had increased in January at
the average rate experienced during 1978, inventory accumulation at about
a $29 billion annual rate would have been needed just for manufacturers
to maintain the very low December stock-sales ratio. The January
accumulation was fairly evenly divided by stage-of-fabrication, which
does not suggest significant speculative stock-building of materials and
supplies.

The book value of wholesale trade inventories rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $13-1/2 billion in January, down from the upward
revised December rate but still above the average for last year. The
increase in these stocks was concentrated in the nondurable sector with
large gains in the food area, probably reflecting rapid advances in prices.
Residential Construction
Housing activity appears to have slowed in recent months,
although part of the decline appears to have been weather-related. Total
private housing starts dropped to 1.66 million units in January--nearly
20 per cent below December's downward revised figure. The sharp fall in
starts in January was concentrated in the single-family sector, down 26
per cent from the strong December pace. Much of this decline occurred in
regions experiencing severe winter weather (North Central States) or
abnormally high precipitation (Western States). In addition to the
effects of adverse weather, there are indications that underlying housing
demand may have weakened somewhat. Sales of both new and existing homes
were off in January, with the largest declines occurring in the South
where weather conditions apparently were not a factor. Reflecting the
slower rate of sales, inventories of new unsold homes represented a 6.4
months' supply in January, up from 6.1 months' supply in the previous
month.
In the multifamily sector, starts have fallen for three conse-
cutive months and in January were about 16 per cent below the October
level, which was bolstered by Federally supported units. Nevertheless,

the most recent data on rental units still show continued historically
low vacancy rates in all areas of the country, and support for multi-
family units from HUD's Section 8 rental assistance program remains a
source of strength in the near term. There are no large inventories
of unsold condominiums such as those that presaged the sharp decline in
multifamily starts in 1973-1974.
Government Sector Activity
For the first four months of the current fiscal year, the Federal
government deficit (not seasonally adjusted) totaled $26.5 billion, about
$6 billion below a year earlier. To date, outlays are proceeding about
in line with OMB's Budget expectations. However, Federal tax receipts have
come in larger than expected in recent months, especially in the withheld
tax category,
Incoming data continue to indicate moderate growth in State and
local government spending. State and local employment rose slightly in
February, after remaining unchanged in January, but the level was still
below the peak of last June. Construction outlays as measured by the
value of new construction put-in-place declined about 7 per cent in
January; despite this, these outlays in real terms were still more than 10
per cent above the year-earlier level.
Prices and Wages
So far this year, most measures of inflation have shown marked
acceleration from the second half of last year. Consumer prices in

II -19
January rose at a 10 per cent annual rate with particularly sharp
increases for food and energy items. Acceleration was even sharper at
the producer level--both for finished goods and for materials--in both
January and February. The rise in producer finished goods prices at
a 14 per cent annual rate in the first two months of this year compares
with a 9 per cent rate rise over the previous 6 months.
The food index in the CPI rose at more than a 17 per cent
annual rate in January. Weather effects contributed to the price increases
for some food items--in particular beef and fresh vegetables, but price
increases for other food items were also quite large. Further large food
price rises were reported at all stages of processing in the February
producer price index. Moreover, spot prices for many farm commodities--
in particular live cattle--have climbed rapidly into mid-March suggesting
little hope of a near-term easing in food prices at the consumer level.
Sharply higher energy prices also were a major contributor to
an acceleration in the January CPI as the gasoline index again surged
upward. In January, gasoline prices were nearly 10 per cent (not annual
rate) above last June. Energy items were also of importance in the
large increases in producer prices of nonfood finished goods and materials
early this year. Energy prices in the near-term are likely to be boosted
further by the recent OPEC price hikes as well as increased markups at
the refinery level reflecting less restrictive Department of Energy
gasoline price regulations.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Since the beginning of the year, domestic financial markets
have given mixed signals regarding underlying economic activity. On
balance, total credit flows to nonfinancial sectors, while showing some
moderation from the pace of late last year, continue to be sizable. The
monetary aggregates, however, have remained weak.
Business short- and intermediate-term credit demands at commer-
cial banks appear to have been strong in botn January and February. In
the long-term area, relatively light public offerings of corporate bonds
and equities in domestic markets were augmented somewhat by stepped-up
issuance of bonds in the Euro-market. In the household sector, mortgage
borrowing apparently rebounded somewhat in January while consumer borrow-
ing slowed. Among government units, a strengthening in borrowings by the
Treasury during the first two montns of the year more than offset a slow-
down by State and local governments.
M-1 declined over the December to February period, even after
adjustment for shifts of funds into automatic transfer savings accounts
(ATS).1 Although ATS balances have continued to expand, total savings
deposits at commercial banks have registered unprecedented declines dur-
ing the past two months. Appreciable increases in small time deposits
and further issuance of large time deposits left M-2 in February only
slightly above its level in December.
1/ The "ATS" adjustment also includes adjustment for inflows to NOW
accounts in New York State.

Despite persistent weakness in the monetary aggregates and a
steady Federal funds rate in the area of 10 per cent, most market inter-
est rates have edged up since the last FOMC meeting, after declining in
January. While most private short-term rates are 5 to 10 basis points
higher (with most of the increase occuring just recently), Treasury bill
rates and long-term rates have advanced 10 to 30 basis points over the
intermeeting period. Contributing to the back-up in rates were events
abroad--notably turmoil in the Middle East and GPEC price increases--and
large increases in published price indexes, both of which heightened
market concerns about inflation. Many market participants now feel that
the Federal Reserve is less likely to ease short-term rates in the near
future and that the System might tighten further.
With Treasury bill rates increasing recently relative to those
on private short-term obligations, the spread between the secondary 90-
day CD rate and the bill rate has continued to narrow from an abnormally
large 200 basis points in November of last year to a more typical differ-
ential of about 60 basis points in early March. The increase in bill
rates since early February appears to be related partly to market reac-
tions to a large volume of cash management bills issued early in March.
In addition, foreign official holdings of Treasury obligations have
declined since the beginning of the year, as the dollar has performed
favorably on foreign exchange markets, and the current account deficit
apparently has been financed by private inflows, including net inflows
into U.S. banks from their foreign branches.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M-1 contracted in February at a 3-3/4 per cent annual rate, con-
tinuing the pattern of weakness that has been evident since last October.

Although some of the weakness during the past five months can be attributed
to the normal reaction of the public to the sharp run-up in short-term
rates in the last several months of 1978, growth in M-1 over this period
has fallen below the path consistent with movements in GNP and interest
rates, even after adjusting for the effects of ATS. Apparently, the very
nigh levels of interest rates in recent months have encouraged unusually
vigorous efforts on the part of the public to pare M-1 balances. The
impact of ATS on M-1 growth in February is estimated to have moderated
to 2 percentage points at an annual rate from 3 percentage points during
each of the first three months ATS was offered.
Savings deposits (inclusive of ATS accounts) declined at an
annual rate of 12 per cent in February, about tne same rate as in
January. This weakness is more pronounced than during previous periods
of high market interest rates (see Chart on page 6), likely reflecting
a greater variety of attractive liquid assets available to the public,
including money market certificates (MMCs).
Net issuance of MMCs at commercial banks surged to a record
$8.9 billion in January and likely remained strong in February, con-
sidering the acceleration of growth in small time deposits during the
month. Owing to the growing popularity of MMCs, the composition of
small time deposits has changed markedly (see Chart on page 7). by
January, MMCs constituted nearly one-fourth of small time deposits
with a maturity of four years or less, and 17 per cent of all small-
denomination time deposits. Moreover, MMCs apparently continued to
1/ Staff estimates, based on an analysis of the 1973 experience,
suggest that about half of the funds raised by commercial banks,
as well as thrift institutions, through MMCs represent deposits
that would not have been attracted or retained in the absence of
this instrument.

divert funds from small time deposits with a maturity of over four years,
as such long-term deposits declined in December and January, the first
sucn monthly declines since their introduction in mid-1973.
The large time deposit component of M-2 also accelerated in
February to a 17-3/4 per cent annual rate of growth, roughly twice its
increase in January. With tne pick-up in growth of both large and small
time deposits, M-2 registered a modest increase in February of 2-1/4 per
cent, following a decline in January.
Although total deposit growth at thrift institutions has remained
stronger than savings and small time deposits at commercial banks, the
composition of thrift deposit growth has been very similar to that of
commercial banks. MMCs at thrift institutions have continued to augment
expansion in total deposits, and savings deposits have decreased in recent
months.1 Total deposits at thrifts grew at a 7-3/4 per cent annual rate
in February, somewhat less than in the previous three months.
weakness in the monetary aggregates during the first two months
of the year has been accompanied by activity in some alternative invest-
ments that are available to depositors of moderate means. Most notably,
money market mutual funds surged by a record $2.6 billion in January and
by another $2.3 billion in February. In addition, the average weekly
amount of noncompetitive tenders in Treasury bill auctions was about the
same during the months of January and February as in the fourth quarter
of last year.
1/ Indeed, on a month-end basis, credit unions experienced a substan-
tial outflow of deposits in January--a development which has been
typical recently of the first month of the quarter and appears to
be related to depositors taking advantage, during the reinvestment
period, of nigher yields available on alternative instruments.
2/ However, in the Treasury's February auction of 2-year notes,
noncompetitive tenders were at the lowest level since last April.

III -9
Bank credit growth rebounded in January and February, following
some sluggishness during late 1978.1 The acceleration in large part
reflected expansion in investments, which had declined over the last nalf
of 1978. In particular, a moderate reduction in bank holdings of Treasury
securities in January was more than offset by a sharp increase in such
securities in February.2 Total loan growth over the first two months of
the year was moderately above the pace of the previous two months. Strength
was especially evident in business loans, which grew at an average annual
rate of 24 per cent. In addition, expansion in real estate lending during
the first two months of the year was at the same appreciable pace of late
1978; consumer loan growth in January was slightly below that of the fourth
quarter.
With growth of bank credit outstripping that of deposits subject
to rate ceilings in both January and February, banks turned to managed lia-
bilities to finance the shortfall. Net issuance of large time deposits--
including negotiable CDs--was almost $8 billion over the two months while
nondeposit sources of funds are estimated to have yielded an additional
$9-1/4 billion. Reflecting the greater reliance on managed liabilities,
the borrowing ratio for large commercial banks has risen further since
year-end to a level in excess of the 1974 peak.
Since the turn of the year, Eurodollar borrowings have become
a major source of financing for bank credit growth. Over this period,
gross liabilities to banks' own foreign brancnes--included in the non-

bank credit figures for both January and February should be considered
tentative.
2/ The increases in bank profits since mid-1978 appear to have outpaced the
sizable advances in earnings in the first half of last year, and to have
continued to induce banks to acquire tax-exempt securities, a major com-
ponent of other securities.

not included in the nondeposit measure.
Business Finance
Business short- and intermediate-term borrowing appears to have
been sizable during the first two montns of tne year, mainly reflecting a
resurgence in borrowing from banks. Preliminary data indicate that the
28-1/2 per cent growth in business loans net of holdings of bankers accep-
tances at comnercial banks in January was followed by a 15-1/2 per cent
increase in February.1 Strength in business loans at large banks in January
was especially evident in the wholesale and retail trade categories--along
with services--and accompanied a sizable increase in wholesale trade inven-
tories during that month. In addition, finance company business lending
continued to grow in January, although at a rate well oelow the substantial
fourth quarter pace. Indirect evidence--based on finance company issuance
of commercial paper and industry reports--indicates that such lending con-
tinued to expand in February. Ly contrast, commercial paper issued by
nonfinancial companies declined somewhat over the two months. The recent
weakness in commercial paper is attributable in part to communication and
electric and gas utilities. Reports indicate that the utilities have
recently had strong cash flows and have also turned to longer-term finan-
cing, including private placements.
1/ According to the February Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, credit
terms on business loans tightened on balance from three months earlier,
perhaps reflecting leaner balance sheet positions. The results of
this survey are discussed in detail in tne appendix.

III -12
The expansion in snort-term borrowing over the past two years
has contributed to the erosion of tne liquidity positions of manufacturing
companies of all sizes (see Chart on page 13). The liquidity ratios for
all but the very large manufacturers remained above their 1974 trougns
in the third quarter of 1978 (most recent information available), having
retraced only a portion of their previous cyclical gains. In contrast,
the liquidity ratio for very large companies, those with assets in excess
of $1 billion, had fallen sharply, to a level below its 1974 trough; how-
ever, their ratio remained above those of other firms. In addition, many
big firms apparently have access to substantial bank lines of credit, as
unused loan commitments at large banks have continued to reach new record
levels.1
In the long-term area, public bond offerings in domestic markets
remained light in February. The bulk of the February volume was in utility
issues, approximately one-half of which were offerings by two A.T. & T. sub-
sidiaries. Publicly offered industrial issues were at their lowest monthly
level since September 1974. Private placements are also estimated to have
been somewhat smaller in recent months than in 1977 and most of 1978, although
they apparently have declined by less than public offerings.
1/ Loan commitments to businesses, especially formal commitments, rose
markedly in late 1978 and early 1979. From October 1978 through
January 1979 unused commitments expanded $11 billion, to a level of
nearly $157 billion. The January level (most recent data available)
was $21 billion above the level one year earlier.
2/ December data for a sample of life insurance companies suggest that
takedowns of privately-placed bonds in that month fell substantially
short of the record volume of 1977. However, these firms did report
an increased volume of new loan commitments, indicating that lower-
rated industrial concerns--the principal issuers of privately-placed
bonds--will continue to receive a large volume of intermediate- and
longer-term funds in the coming months.

U.S. corporations have supplemented funds raised in domestic mar-
kets with heavier borrowing in the Eurodollar bond market since the first
of the year. In February, the volume of sucn borrowings, at $600 million,
was substantially above the average monthly volume in recent years. For
tne most part, the proceeds from these issues were returned to parent com-
panies for general corporate use.1
Stock offerings in February increased somewhat on a seasonally
adjusted basis from January's low level. Public utilities continued to
account for the bulk of stock issues. Most stock price indexes have risen
moderately, on balance, since the last FOMC meeting. For the year to date,
NYSE stock indexes have posted only modest gains, while the American Stock
Exchange Composite and NASDAQ indexes have shown more appreciable gains.
Even with the back-up in corporate bond yields since the February
FOMC meeting, such rates remain 50 to 100 basis points below their 1974
peaks. By contrast, Treasury coupon rates are about 50 basis points above
their 1974 peaks giving rise to a substantially smaller spread between pri-
vate and Treasury bonds than in 1974.2 The relatively better performance
of private bond rates reflects smaller risk premiums built into private
yields--1974 was a recession period--as well as a large issuance of Treasury
bonds over the past four years. Within corporate bond markets, yield spreads
1/ The pick-up in borrowing reportedly was encouraged by a temporary decline
in Eurodollar bond yields in late January relative to many domestic U.S.
interest rates. Corporations can move quickly to take advantage of such
rate movements in Eurodollar markets, in contrast to domestic markets where
SEC registration requirements can add significantly to the time required
to implement a decision to borrow. In addition, Eurodollar issues typi-
cally have much shorter call protection than do domestic issues, increas-
ing their attractiveness to borrowers at this time.
2/ Treasury bill rates are currently only about 20 basis points below their
1974 peaks, in contrast to private short-term rates which are 200 to
to 300 basis points below peaks reached in 1974.

remain quite narrow compared to 1974, although tney have increased slightly
in the past year.
Government Debt Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting, the Treasury has raised about $6.1
billion (NSA) of new money through the sale of marketable issues. A cash
management bill, raising about $4.0 billion, was sold in early March to
bridge a low point in the cash balance prior to the mid-April tax date.
On the other hand, since mid-February the Treasury has allowed $200 million
of 3-month bills to run off in each weekly auction. In the coupon market,
the Treasury raised $2.9 billion of new cash in its regular auction of 4-
year notes in late February. An additional $1.4 billion equivalent was
raised by the Treasury in late February through the sale of Deutsche mark-
denominated securities to German investors. The Treasury has now sold
three issues denominated in foreign currencies since November 1, totalling
$4.1 billion.
Sponsored credit agency borrowing has been $4.7 billion thus far
during 1979, with $3.2 billion raisea in February. The bulk of this sizable
borrowing was done by FNMA, FHLB, and FHLMC; however, not all of the funds
were needed by the housing agencies to cover lending, and their liquidity
has increased over this period. In particular, the liquidity of the FHLBs
rose $1.4 billion in February, as advances outstanding declined more than
$700 million, a bit less than seasonally.
Gross offerings of tax-exempt bonds in February were $2.5 billion--
off slightly from January and down substantially from the average monthly
volume in 1978. A growing amount of tax-exempt issues has taken the form
of revenue bonds to provide low-cost financing for single-family housing.
The volume of single-family mortgage revenue bonds was $400 million in

February, about the same as in January. Such offerings nave grown consid-
erably since mid-1978, when Chicago became the first local government to
issue securities for such purposes. Prior to that time, the issuance of
mortgage revenue bonds was largely confined to State Housing Finance
Agencies.
Mortgage and Consumer Market Finance
Net mortgage lending picked up in January from the reduced volume
in December, but apparently remained below the monthly highs posted in 1978.
Net mortgage acquisitions by two key private lender groups--S&Ls and commer-
cial banks--both moved up somewhat in January on a sesonally adjusted basis,
after dropping sharply in December. For each group, however, January lend-
ing volume remained below November's pace.
Mortgage commitments outstanding at S&Ls declined in January for
the second consecutive month. By the end of the month, S&L commitments out-
standing were 3 per cent below last November's peak, according to preliminary
estimates, and were 2 per cent below their year-earlier level.1 New commit-
ment policy on conventional home mortgages at S&Ls, commercial banks, MSBs,
and mortgage companies remained less accommodative in early February than
was the case in the fall of last year, according to a new FHLBB series.
Although the proportion of all reporting lenders offering commitments for
25-year loans in the various loan-to-price categories has edged up slightly
or has been unchanged since early January, these proportions remain consid-
erably below those of last fall (see Chart on page 20). Moreover, tne share
of respondents offering commitments in the highest risk bracket (with a 95

per cent loan-to-value ratio) has remained at the lowest level in four years.
To rate, however, this measure of lending policy generally has firmed much
less than in 1973 and 1974.
Since the last FOMC meeting, average contract interest rates on
new commitments for 80 per cent home mortgages at sampled S&Ls nave remained
essentially unchanged. At a near-record 10.4 per cent, the average rate
on Marcn 9 was about 70 basis points above early June, and well in excess of
usury ceilings of 10 per cent or less that still prevail in about one-third
of the States. Field reports continue to empnasize the restrictive impact
of below-market usury ceilings on home mortgage lending, especially on con-
ventional loans. The legislative efforts that are under way in a number of
States to ease or remove these ceilings have reportedly increased the reluc-
tance of some lenders to arrange new mortgage commitments at interest rates
conforming to current usury limits.
In the secondary mortgage market, yield movements have been mixed
since the last FOMC meeting. On balance, yields on GNMA securities have
increased along with rates on intermediate-term Treasury securities, while
yields in FMNA's bi-weekly auctions of forward commitments have moved down
somewhat. In FNMA's March 5 auction, discounts on FHA/VA loans continued
to average above 6.0 points, and field reports suggest that discounts of
this amount continued to discourage borrowing in the government-underwritten
sector of the market.
1/ Regionally, the average rate--reflecting commitments at S&Ls in States
without binding usury ceilings--ranged from 10-1/4 per cent in the South-
east to 10-1/2 per cent in the west and Southwest, where rates were down
1/4 of a percentage point from early February. Further rate increases
are in store for many existing borrowers in California with variable-rate
mortgage loans outstanding. On February 21, the Federal Home Loan Bank
of San Francisco announced a 30 basis point increase in its semi-annual
cost-of-funds index for S&Ls in California. Interest rates on outstanding
variable-rate mortgages in California may be adjusted in line with this
index, after a lag of several months.

Consumer instalment credit expansion slowed in January to a 13
per cent annual rate, down from the 17-1/2 per cent pace of the fourth
quarter. A portion of the slowdown appears to have been related to narsher
than normal weatner conditions in some parts of the country.
Meanwhile, the latest information (fourth quarter) on consumer
loan delinquencies shows little evidence of increasing payment difficulties.
Mortgage delinquencies at S&Ls fell to the lowest levels since 1973, and
delinquencies on closed-end instalment loans at commercial banks remained
stable, well below the 1975 peaks.1
1/ The average delinquency rate on bank-card credit has been rising, but
the bulk of the uptrend has occurred in New York. Confidential bank
reports further indicate that the increase in New York is concentrated
at a single bank that recently embarked on a program of multi-state
card issuance.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. The average exchange value of the dollar
has shown almost no net change over the six week period since the last
Greenbook. As shown in the Chart, a sharp drop in dollar exchange rates
in early February in reaction to the turmoil in Iran was subsequently reversed
and since mid-February the dollar has fluctuated in a narrow range. The
dollar has remained in strong demand over the past month despite announcements
of unfavorable U.S. inflation and trade data. This strength has been due
in part to market perception of continued firmness in U.S. monetary policy
as well as indications of a pick-up of inflation abroad.
.Selling pressure on the Japanese currency was
generated by evidence of a decline in Japan's current account surplus and
an acceleration in Japanese inflation, as well as recognition of Japan's
heavy dependence on imported oil at a time of oil shortages and rising oil
prices. An additional factor depressing the yen over the past month was
the conversion into dollars of several substantial foreign borrowings in
yen.
In contrast to the situation in Japan, the relative oil self-
sufficiency of Britain and Canada contributed to the recent strong exchange
market demand for the pound and Canadian dollar, and both these currencies

appreciated by over 2 per cent against the U.S. dollar over the past six
weeks. The Bank of England moderated sterling's rise by purchasing
The European Monetary System -- essentially an expansion of the
snake currency band to include France, Italy and Ireland -- began operation
on March 13. The EMS had originally been scheduled to begin at the first
of the year, but was delayed until compromise could be reached on aspects of
EEC agricultural policy. The French franc came under heavy selling pressure
against the mark in the days immediately preceding the start of the arrangement
as the market attempted to assess appropriate cross rates within the EMS.
Once official parity cross rates were
announced, however, speculative pressure on the franc subsided and the EMS
began operation with member currencies trading within permitted fluctuation
limits without intervention support.
U.S. intervention operations over the past six weeks resulted in
net purchases of foreign currencies equivalent to $1.8 billion.
With its share of these purchases, the System reduced out-
standing mark swap drawings to $3.4 billion equivalent and repaid in full
remaining swap drawings on the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan.
Total System swap debt is now less than 2/3 of its peak level at the end
of December. In addition to making swap repayments, the System increased

IV -4
its holdings of yen and Swiss franc balances to a total of $160 million
equivalent. The Treasury increased its holdings of foreign currencies to
over $6 billion equivalent through another issue of mark-denominated notes
in February, for which payment was received on March 1.

IV -5
U.S. International Transactions. The merchandise trade balance
in January is estimated to have widened substantially to $41.3 billion at
an annual rate on an international accounts basis. (See the following
chart.) This sizeable increase, however, may be due more to a major
revision of seasonal adjustment procedures than to change in the under-
lying U.S. trade position.1/ The new seasonal adjustment pattern reduces
fourth quarter imports with an offsetting rise in first quarter imports.
As shown in the table below,when applied to 1978 data the new seasonal
pattern produces a more dramatic improvement in the U.S. trade balance
during the quarters of 1978 with the deficit falling by the fourth
quarter to a $25 billion annual rate, about $4 billion less than on
the old basis. Moreover, in part because petroleum imports are no
longer seasonally adjusted, there is a sharp jump in imports between
December and January as compared to little change on the old basis.
Against this background the very large increase in the January deficit
does not indicate any clear departure from our general outlook for
continued improvement in the U.S. trade and current accounts in 1979.
1/ Under the new methodology, seasonally adjusted export and import
totals are the sum of the seasonally adjusted commodity components
-- previously the totals were seasonally adjusted independently --
and components for which no seasonal pattern is apparent, notably oil
imports, are no longer adjusted. The new methodology produces the
interesting result that the revision in "seasonal factors" leads to
a considerable increase in quarter-to-quarter and month-to-month
changes in the levels of imports, exports and the trade balance for
past years.

Most of the increase in the deficit from December to
January resulted from a rise in imports. Oil imports were up sharply
as the volume of oil imported rose 10 per cent to 9.9 million barrels
per day and prices rose 1 per cent on average to $13.66 per barrel.
Much of this increase is associated with the arrival of shipments made
in anticipation of the January 1 OPEC price increase. The curtailment
of Iranian oil exports late last year should be more apparent in
February and March data for U.S. imports while recently announced price
increases by some oil producers will be seen largely in second quarter
import data. Non-oil imports rose by 8 per cent following continued
strength in U.S. economic activity. Most of the increase was in consumer

IV -8
goods, capital goods, and automotive products from Canada. Auto
imports from other regions declined in January.
Exports in January declined slightly from their November-
December level. An expected drop in agricultural exports from the
high levels of November and December (primarily grains and tobacco)
along with a small decline in machinery exports was partly offset
by increases in other nonagricultural exports including, primarily,
industrial supplies, civilian aircraft, and automotive products.

After private capital outflows of about $10.8 billion and
Increases in foreign official assets in the U.S. of $17.1 billion in the fourth
quarter of last year, the dollar strengthened in exchange markets in
January and February and this pattern of capital movements was reversed.
See table below. In January U.S. banks raised about $5-1/3 billion
net from foreign sources, largely in transactions with their foreign
branches, and partial data suggest another strong net inflow in
February.
A part of the inflow shown in interbank transactions in
January reflects the return to U.S. banks of funds shifted by U.S.
residents from banks in the United States to banks abroad. The avail-
able data for January show that the foreign branches of U.S. banks
in the Carribbean and the U.K. increased their liabilities to U.S.
residents by about $3 billion. In addition, Eurodollar CD holdings
of open-ended money market mutual funds increased by $225 million (9
per cent of the increase in their total assets), and the Eurodollar
CD holdings of short-term unit trusts (closed-ended money-market
funds) rose by about $200 million.
Foreign official holdings of Treasury securities fell
by an estimated $2.9 billion in February following a small increase
in January. The retirement of swap-related Treasury nonmarketable
securities (in connection with the U.S. repayments of swap drawings)
accounted for most of the decrease.

Foreign Economic Developments. The major development which
has become evident since the previous greenbook is the increase in the
rate of inflation in several industrial economies (see Chart). In
France, Italy, and the United Kingdom the rate of inflation rose
noticeably in January, while in Germany, Japan, and Switzerland --
the only countries which have released February price data -- infla-
tion increased during the first two months of the year. In several
countries the increase was reflected in both consumer and wholesale
prices. Part of the acceleration is related to seasonal factors,
especially in the case of Germany and France. Although the staff
expected a pickup in inflation in each of these countries during
1979, the acceleration thus far has been more pronounced than had been
anticipated. Except in the case of Switzerland (see below), it is
unlikely that much of the pickup in inflation rates can be explained
by recent oil price increases.
Prospects for a continuation of moderate GNP growth abroad
during 1979 have remained essentially unchanged during the past
month. In Japan, industrial production continued to expand through
January and GNP in the fourth quarter of 1978 grew at about 7 per
cent (s.a.a.r.). During the same quarter, German GNP grew at a rate of
about 6 per cent (s.a.a.r.) and an expansionary outlook has been
noted in recent investment surveys. Thus, although the latest in-
dustrial production data are weak, the outlook for German economic
activity remains favorable.

In terms of external balances, perhaps the most notable
statistic, reflecting primarily the international adjustment process
at work, is the continued decline in the Japanese current-account
surplus to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of less than $4 billion
in January. In most other countries, external positions have changed
little in recent months. Although the German current-account surplus
(n.s.a.) declined in January, it is possible that most of this de-
crease was due to seasonal factors.
Individual country notes. In Japan, stronger domestic de-
mand continues to be offset by a weakening external sector, while
increased upward pressure on prices has emerged as a potentially
important constraint on expansionary policy in 1979.
Activity in Japan has strengthened somewhat in recent months;
in the three months ending in January, industrial production increased
over its level in the preceding three months at a rate exceeding 10 per
cent (s.a.a.r.). Nevertheless, no significant inroads appear to have
been made in unemployment, which persists at a level that is histori-
cally high for Japan. Moreover, the authorities are now expressing
increased concern over possible increases in inflationary pressure in
coming months from a build-up of liquidity in the private sector, in-
creased government expenditure in FY 1979, higher overseas commodity
prices, and the absence of beneficial effects from appreciation of the
yen. Wholesale prices, which declined by 2.5 per cent during 1978, in-
creased in the three months ending in February over their average level
of the previous three months at an annual rate of about 5 per cent.

IV -17
Recent trade data show that adjustment to past exchange
rate changes is continuing strongly. In January, when emergency im-
ports were only about $200 million, the current-account surplus (s.a.)
narrowed to $340 million, while the trade surplus (s.a.) was $940
million -- levels which are both about $1 billion below corresponding
monthly average levels in 1978. In view of the more stable condition
of the yen in foreign exchange markets in recent months, in February
the Ministry of Finance eliminated both the 50 per cent marginal re-
serve requirement on free yen deposits and the remaining restrictions
on foreigners' purchases of Japanese securities.
In spite of an extremely severe winter and a hard fought
steelworker's strike, the German economic climate remains favorable.
Growth of real GNP in 1978, at 3.4 per cent, was quite close to the
original official projection and much higher than widely predicted as
late as September 1978. Real GNP in the fourth quarter grew at an
annualized rate of 6 per cent. Domestic demand, both public and
private, has been a source of strength. The construction industry in
particular has been running into capacity constraints. Recent surveys
on investment plans have found a predominance of expansionary senti-
ment. While recent industrial production data show a less buoyant
economy, with the index having remained unchanged since September,
it is possible that the index may be overstating the effects of a
harsh winter.

IV -18
The seasonally-adjusted rate of unemployment has remained
at 4.2 per cent for the past three-months (ending in January), in
spite of considerable weather-related unemployment this winter.
Consumer prices, having decelerated throughout 1978 and having
reached a rate of 2.6 per cent for the year, recorded sharp increases
early this year. The average annualized rate for January and Feb-
ruary of the seasonally-unadjusted consumer price index was somewhat
above 10 per cent. However, most of this increase may be due to
seasonal factors. Wholesale and producer prices also have accelerated
strongly in these two months.
In February the Swiss consumer price index rose 1.1 per cent
(n.s.a.), which is the largest monthly increase since 1974 and follows
an increase in January of 0.4 per cent. Both of these rates are high
compared with the average annual inflation rate in 1978 of 1 per cent.
Wholesale prices also increased rapidly in the first two months of the
year. The rise in both indices during February was mostly due to a
26 per cent jump in the price of fuel oil. Switzerland purchases a sub-
stantial amount on the spot market and hence has felt the impact of oil
price hikes earlier and to a larger extent than other countries. Import
prices are no longer exerting downward pressure on inflation as a re-
sult of the success of exchange-rate stabilization policy, and the in-
creased liquidity in the Swiss money market also may be beginning to
have an expansionary effect on economic activity and prices. Although
some increase in the inflation rate was anticipated, a shift to con-
tractionary monetary policy is likely if the inflation rate does not
subside in the next few months.

IV -19
The pace of economic activity in the United Kingdom weakened
in the fourth quarter of 1978. Between the third and fourth quarters
of last year, real private consumption expenditures -- particularly on
automobiles -- fell and industrial production declined by some 4-1/2
per cent (s.a.a.r.). One preliminary measure of GDP indicates a fall
of about 1/2 per cent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter. Industrial
disputes were partly responsible for the weakness in activity toward
the end of 1978, and may have adverse effects on output in the first
half of this year as well.
British inflation appears to be accelerating. Monthly
rates of change of both wholesale and consumer prices have been in-
creasing in recent months. Further evidence of an upward trend in
inflation rates is provided by a consumer-price index published by
the U.K.'s Price Commission, which showed a fairly sharp rise in Jan-
uary. (This index is based on price changes which have been proposed
to the Commission by large companies but not yet put into effect).
Concern about the rate of growth of the money supply and
general upward pressure on market interest rates led the Bank of
England to increase its Minimum Lending Rate (MLR) from 12-1/2 to
14 per cent on February 8. Subsequently, market rates subsided some-
what and the Bank lowered the MLR by 1 percentage point (to 13 per
cent) on March 1.
During the past month there has been little change in the
French economic situation, and no change in basic policy. The major
weak spot in the present picture is the unemployment situation, which

IV -20
is still worsening slowly. Between January 1978 and January 1979
the unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent to 5.9 per cent (1.3
million people) and further increases seem likely. The government's
steel-sector program, for instance, is scheduled to produce more than
20,000 layoffs within a few months. In areas such as Lorraine, which
depends heavily on steel, there were signs of labor unrest (including
some violence) during February, and government officials have been
trying to work out adjustment programs acceptable to the labor unions.
The French inflation rate increased somewhat in January, though most
of the rise is believed to be attributable to seasonal factors. The
rate of inflation remains high relative to most participants in the
European Monetary System.
In Italy the inflation rate jumped sharply in January after
a period of stable price increases. Consumer prices rose 1.9 per cent
(n.s.a.) compared with the 11.6 per cent increase in the 12 months
ending December 1978, while wholesale prices in January increased
(1.7) per cent (n.s.a.) after two years in which the annual rate of
increase was in the 8-9 per cent range. An important element in the
cost of living jump was the sharp rent increases permitted under the
new "fair rent" law; additional substantial rent increases are expected
throughout the year. Further inflationary pressure also can be ex-
pected from wage increases due both to index-linked wage adjustments and
higher labor costs following the completion of the current round of
contract negotiations. After a three-month period of significant growth
in economic activity, the industrial production index declined in
December and January.

IV -21
The fall of the Italian government and the likelihood of
parliamentary elections this year (two years ahead of schedule) have
considerably clouded the general outline of economic policy. The
outgoing government had proposed a three-year plan for redirecting
resources from public and private consumption to investment and the
expansion of employment; the status of the three-year plan is now
uncertain.
Real GDP in Canada rose by 4.2 per cent (s.a.a.r.) during
the fourth quarter, while real GNP grew at an annual rate of only
2 per cent. The difference between these growth rates was primarily
due to an exceptionally large outflow of dividends during the fourth
quarter, following the lifting of wage and price (and dividend) con-
trols. The real output gain was confined to a $C 1.8 billion
accumulation of inventories and a sharp increase of export volumes.
Real personal consumption on goods and services dropped moderately
while real levels of capital investment and government spending on
goods and services were virtually unchanged from the third quarter.
Canada had a 3.4 per cent gain in real GNP during 1978 after a 2.7
per cent rise in 1977.
The current-account balance in the Netherlands swung sharply
into deficit in 1978. On a transactions basis, the deficit for the
first 10 months of 1978 was $1.5 billion, compared with a $500 million
surplus in 1977, and an average annual surplus in the 1972-76 period
of over $2 billion. Both trade and invisibles contributed to the 1978

IV -22
deterioration. The concentration of industries with structural
problems (steel, textiles, and chemicals) in the Netherlands, de-
clining natural gas export volumes, and the appreciation of the
guilder are the underlying causes. The current-account in Belgium
shifted into deficit in 1976 and this deficit has been growing
fairly steadily through the end of 1978.

IV -23
Trade balances in the six major foreign industrial countries
in 1978. The trade surplus of the six major foreign countries in 1978
was about $47 billion, compared to about $29 billion in the previous
year. For the year, the trade deficits of Italy and the United Kingdom
decreased and that of France turned to a slight surplus, while the
trade surpluses of Canada, Germany and Japan rose. However, as the
year progressed the move toward surplus decreased or changed direction
for each of the six countries except Germany. By the fourth quarter of
1978 the trade surplus of the six countries was reduced to about $38
billion (s.a.a.r.).
Unlike the pattern in 1977, when for the six countries
combined export volumes increased by substantially more than import
volumes, most of the changes in these countries trade balances during
1978 resulted from a rise in the terms of trade (see table). The
improvement reflected the weakness of commodity prices. Moreover,
especially for Japan and Germany it also reflected an appreciation of
their weighted-average exchange rates.
The improvement in the terms of trade was offset by rapid in-
creases in import volumes in each of the six countries as real GNP ex-
panded. Despite rapidly expanding exports from industrial to the non-
oil developing countries in 1978, the rise of export volumes slowed in
Germany,and there was an actual decline in Japan, reflecting the exchange

IV -24
rate changes. In Japan this resulted in a steady decline of the trade
surplus throughout the year, whereas in Germany the shift in trade
volumes was about offset by the rise in its terms of trade.

APPENDIX
SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY
ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES*
Responses to the February Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
indicate some moderation on balance of the trend toward tightening of
non-price lending terms which had been reported over the last two years.
In contrast to the strengthening this year of estimated business loans
by all commercial banks and the continued sizable increases in loan
commitments through January, a majority of the 121 respondents to the
survey perceived that their business loan demand was unchanged or weaker
in the three months ending in mid-February.
The number of respondents to the Survey reporting that the
demand for business loans had weakened from 3 months earlier rose sharply
from the November survey and actually exceeded--for the first time
since May 1976--the number of banks reporting stronger loan demand.
Just under a third of respondents anticipate that stronger loan demand
will resume in the 3 months following the February survey, considerably
more than the number expecting further weakness but well below the
fifty per cent of respondents who anticipated stronger growth at the
time of the previous survey. The weakening of perceived loan demand
was apparent at both large banks (with assets exceeding $5 billion)
and medium size banks (with assets of $1-5 billion).
At the time of the February survey, the prime rate at the
majority of banks had been unchanged since late December but had
risen by over one percentage point since the November survey. By con-
trast, downward pressure since year end had driven commercial paper
rates below their level at the time of the previous survey. Conse-
quently, the typical cost of bank credit had become unusually high
relative to the cost of alternative forms of short term credit. To
some degree, large banks appeared to have offset these costs by
easing their compensating balance requirements and by relaxing some-
what their standards of creditworthiness to qualify for the prime rate.
Medium size banks left compensating balance requirements about un-
changed in the November-February period while tightening somewhat
their standards of creditworthiness. At the time of the previous
survey, respondents at both large and medium size banks reported that
these non-price terms had been tightened considerably.
Criteria used to review credit lines for established and local
service area customers, which were reported to have been appreciably
tightened at the time of the previous survey, were unchanged in the 3

of Research and Statistics.

A- 2
months ending in February. Criteria for new and non-local service
area customers were reported to be tightened in the February survey
but by fewer banks than had been the case in November.
As they have in recent surveys, respondents reported another
decline in their overall willingness to make fixed-rate loans. How-
ever, the number of banks reporting less willingness to extend this
type of credit--which had been rising throughout 1978--declined in
February. The emergence of some slowing in the recent trend toward
increasing reluctance to extend credit is also evident for several
other loan categories, including secured construction and single and
multifamily real estate loans. Respondents' willingness to make con-
sumer loans, which had turned toward restriction for the first time in
over 2 years at the time of the previous survey, was essentially unchanged
in the November-February period.
There was actually an increased willingness at medium-size
banks to make 1-5 year commercial and industrial loans in the 3 months
ending in February. Although respondents continued to indicate growing
unwillingness to make longer-term commercial and industrial loans, this
attitude has become considerably less pronounced in both large and
medium size banks since November. There was also an increased willing-
ness to make participation loans with correspondents in the November-
February period, particularly at large banks.
