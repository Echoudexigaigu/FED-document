The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
It is clear that economic activity in the first quarter slowed
from the brisk pace of late 1978, although strong employment growth
continued in March and industrial production rebounded from the weather-
related sluggish performance in January and February. In the business
sector capital spending indicators also continue to suggest near-term
strength, and there were sizable increases in the book values of manu-
facturers' and wholesalers' inventories in February. Total retail sales
increased moderately in March after two months of near stagnation; however,
excluding autos and nonconsumer items sales rose only a little. In
addition, housing starts fell sharply further in February, apparently
reflecting both severe weather and some weakening of underlying demand.
The pace of inflation has intensified, led by rapid increases in food
and energy items. The rates of increase of producer and consumer prices
so far this year have been the highest since 1974.
Employment and Production
Labor demand was strong again last month as total employment
(household survey) advanced by nearly 200,000. The labor force grew
by a similar amount, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.7 per
cent, remaining in the 5-3/4 to 6 per cent range that has prevailed
since last August. Nonfarm payroll employment (establishment survey)
rose by 325,000 following an increase of 300,000 in February. A substan-
tial share of the March advance was in the service-producing sector where

increases in employment at retail establishments were sizable for the
third consecutive month. Among goods-producing industries, contract
construction employment rebounded 70,000 during the month after a slight
decline in the two preceding months. In manufacturing, employment
again grew 70,000--about the same as the average monthly gain in 1977 and
1978--and the workweek edged up 0.1 hour to 40.8 hours. Hiring advances
continued to be concentrated in the durable goods sector, especially in
the machinery and the electrical and transportation equipment industries.
Rapid growth in durable goods output since last fall has pushed employment
in those industries more than 4-3/4 per cent above the 1973 pre-recession
peak. In contrast, employment in soft goods industries has been on a
plateau the past four months and remains a bit short of its previous high.
(Chart, p. 11-3).
Approximately 300,000 unionized truck drivers and warehouse
workers were idled on April 2 following a breakdown in collective bar-
gaining between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the
industry's employer association. A tentative agreement was reached on wage
and benefit issues on April 10, and truckers are expected to begin returning
to work shortly. The work stoppage caused some cutbacks in factory produc-
tion schedules, particularly in the auto industry.
It is expected that industrial production increased about three-
quarters per cent in March, following slow growth over the two preceding
months. In the materials sector, significant gains apparently occurred

II -5
for steel and for other metals, paper, and coal. Renewed strength was
evident in automotive production as auto assemblies increased almost
7 per cent in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.4 million
units. Preliminary production plans for the second quarter, announced
before the work stoppage in trucking, indicated schedules for a slightly
lower assembly rate of 9.2 million units per year.
The rise in industrial production as estimated boosted the
manufacturing capacity utilization rate to around 86-1/2 per cent.
This is only 1-1/2 percentage points below the 1973 high, and for the
advanced processing group the rate is now close to its prerecession peak.
In contrast, the operating rate for materials, at 88 per cent, is 5
percentage points below the 1973 peak. However, capacity pressures are
developing in some areas such as aluminum mill products, cement, plastics,
and some machinery components.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Total personal income over the January-February period rose at an
annual rate of only 5-3/4 per cent; in contrast, the rate of increase over the
fourth quarter of 1978 was at a 16-1/4 per cent rate. The slowdown--most
marked in January--partly reflects special factors. A large volume of Federal
prices-deficiency payments to farmers had been made in December and
personal income social insurance deductions increased sharply in January.
(Although all of the increase in the payroll tax deductions will not be
reflected in paychecks until later in the year.) Partially offsetting

these special factors was the effect on salary disbursements of the
January boost in the minimum wage. With the large increases in
consumer prices in January and February, real personal income fell
at a 6-1/2 per cent annual rate during this period; however, the fall
in spending power was cushioned somewhat by the Federal income tax cut.
Retail sales excluding autos and nonconsumer items rose only
0.3 per cent in March, following a 1.5 per cent increase in February.
For the quarter as a whole, sales for this grouping advanced 1.6 per
cent, well below the average pace during the second half of 1978. Pur-
chases of discretionary items at general merchandise, apparel, and
furniture stores (GAF) rose briskly in March after declines in the
previous two months. Current dollar food store sales declined despite
the recent surge in prices.
Total unit auto sales rose sharply, apparently boosted by con-
cerns about the availability and cost of gasoline, and were at a 12.3
million unit annual rate last month--900,000 units more than February
and exceeded only by the record rate in March 1973. Sales of domestic
units, paced by a large gain for small cars, also rose strongly to a 9.5
million unit rate. Imports sold at a 2.8 million unit pace, up sharply
from the 2 million unit plateau of the last two years and a record monthly
selling rate. Consumer purchases of trucks fell 200,000 units (annual
rate) in February to a level well below the fourth-quarter average.
All of this decline occurred in the domestic models, as sales of imported
trucks--generally small sized--increased by about 80,000 units (annual
rate) in February.

II -9
The buoyance of durable goods and especially automobile sales
appears consistent with the attitudes of consumers as reported by the
Michigan Survey Research Center. The March survey showed that the
majority of consumers continued to rate buying conditions as favorable
for large household durables and homes. Three-quarters of the respondents
cited buy-in-advance rationales for these opinions, a record for the
survey and up from the one-in-two reported during the prior two years.
In contrast, and apparently because of intense inflationary expectations,
the index of consumer sentiment continued the downward trend evident
since the fall of 1977.
Business Investment
Investment spending in the first quarter appears to have been
characterized by continued momentum of equipment outlays and by weather-
related disruptions of building activity. The value of shipments of
nondefense capital goods in the first two months of this year was nearly
4 per cent above the fourth quarter average. In contrast, the value of
new private nonresidential construction put in place in January and
February was down slightly from the average in the fourth quarter.
Business spending commitments continue to suggest sustained
strength of capital goods outlays over the near term. New orders for
nondefense capital goods rose 5.9 per cent in February. However, this
increase was dominated by aircraft orders, which tend to have long
production lead times; because of the already large backlog of aircraft

orders, production of the recent ones will spread into the 1980's. Ex-
cluding aircraft, new orders for nondefense capital goods in February
declined 2.5 per cent. New bookings for machinery--generally indicative
of the underlying demand for equipment--fell somewhat in February, but
remained 2.7 per cent above the fourth quarter monthly average. Export
orders for machinery in January, the most recent month for which data
are available, were particularly strong. The value of nonresidential
construction contracts, which are quite volatile, were well above the
fourth quarter average in January and February.
The book value of manufacturers' inventories rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $31 billion in February, following a gain of $34
billion in January. In the face of continuing adverse weather, which
probably held down the rise in shipments and swelled the increase in
inventories, the ratio of manufacturers' inventory book values to sales
edged up further in February; even so, this ratio remained low on an
historical basis.
Accumulation at manufacturing continued to be concentrated among
durable goods with producers of transportation equipment, nonelectrical
machinery, and fabricated metal products reporting the largest increases.
Accumulation of nondurables proceeded at about the same relatively moderate
pace as in January, with the largest increase in stocks of food products.

The rapid rate of inventory investment in manufacturing
in January and February appears to reflect a number of factors. The
large recent increases in the prices of food, oil, and crude industrial
materials appear to have swelled book values. In addition, producers
may be building stocks following the sales surge in the fourth quarter.
At the same time, however, the slow growth of shipments early this year
has probably resulted in some involuntary stock building. Finally, the
recent acceleration in inventory investment may reflect scattered attempts
at hedging in anticipation of potential strikes in the trucking and rubber
industries as well as some heightened concern in the petrochemical area
about energy availability. On balance, however, inventory data by state
of processing do not suggest any unusual build-up of materials stocks
that would be indicative of speculative activity.
The book value of wholesale trade inventories rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $20 billion in February, up from the downward-
revised $9 billion January rate. The January-February average gain is about
the same as the fourth quarter pace. The February increase in these
stocks was concentrated in the durable sector, with motor vehicles and
parts, machinery, and hardware registering large gains.
Residential Construction
Housing construction slowed further in February as weather
conditions disrupted markets for the second month in a row. Total
private housing starts fell to a 1.4 million unit annual rate--30per

cent below the average level on 1978--as starts declined in all areas
of the country but the West. Moreover, other data suggest an underlying
weakening of housing activity in the face of continued increases in
housing costs, high interest rates, and tighter nonrate terms.
In the single-family sector, starts fell almost 16 per cent in
February following a 25 per cent decline in the previous month. (Chart)
Total single-family home sales fell in February for the fourth month in
a row. Sales of both new and existing houses also fell in February, the
fourth consecutive month of decline. While the number of unsold new
units has been virtually unchanged since December, the inventory at February's
sales pace represented 7.6 months' supply--the highest in four years.
In the multifamily area, starts fell 15 per cent in February and were
about 30 per cent below the peak reached in the second quarter of last year.
Government Sector
Preliminary Treasury data suggest that Federal receipts in the
first quarter, on a unified budget basis, were 20 per cent above year-
earlier levels. This gain was due in part to a 23 per cent increase in
final payments on corporate tax liabilities. Outlays are estimated to
have increased 9 per cent over the same period, about in line with staff
expectations.
Recent data indicate considerable weakness in State and local
spending. Construction outlays in this sector fell by $4.6 billion in

II -17
February--the fourth consecutive decline and the largest drop since the
inception of this series in 1965; in real terms these expenditures were
about even with year-earlier levels. In addition to the influence of
adverse weather conditions, this trend in construction activity appears to
reflect the winding-down of Federal funding of local public works projects
as well as attitudes of fiscal conservatism at all levels of government.
State and local employment, however, rose by 33,000 in March,
reversing two quarters of declines and putting payrolls fractionally above
their year-earlier levels. Employment was boosted by the hiring of 12,000
persons for Federally-supported public service programs in February; the
Administration's targets call for the addition of another 100,000 persons
by June.
Prices and Wages
Inflation has accelerated significantly in recent months to a
pace not seen since 1974. Consumer prices rose at about a 12 per cent
annual rate in the first two months of the year, compared with an 8-1/2
per cent rise over the second half of 1978. Moreover, producer finished
goods prices rose 1 per cent in March, bringing their first quarter
increase to a 14 per cent annual rate--almost 5-1/2 percentage points
higher than the rise in the previous 6 months.
As has often been the case in recent years, food and energy prices
have been major contributors to the recent high inflation rates. Food
price increases have accelerated markedly, reflecting not only a further

tightening of meat supplies but also widespread price increases for most
other food items. As a result, the producer price index for consumer
finished foods rose 20 per cent (annual rate) in the first quarter.
However, food prices eased at the farm level in March, a development
suggesting that there may be some relief in the increase in retail
food prices in coming months. Prices for live cattle continued to rise
substantially in March, but the increase was smaller than in the first
two months of the year and was largely offset by price declines for
hogs, wheat, and fresh vegetables.
Energy prices also have continued to exert an upward influence on
consumer and producer prices so far in 1979. Gasoline prices have risen
at nearly a 25 per cent annual rate since the beginning of the year.
Moreover, recently announced price hikes by OPEC effective April 1 and
the President's plans to gradually phase out price controls on domestically-
produced crude oil starting June 1 will add to energy price increases.
Outside of the food and energy sectors, the consumer price index
is still being pushed up by rapid increases in homeownership costs--
reflecting higher mortgage interest rates and rising house purchase prices--
as well as continuing large increases in the prices of many other retail
services and commodities. In addition, prices of most nonfood materials--
both unprocessed and semiprocessed--continued to rise quite rapidly through-
out the first quarter of the year.

II -20
Wage rates, as measured by the index of average hourly earnings,
rose at a 9 per cent annual rate in March, following an upward-revised
6 per cent rate of increase a month earlier. For the first quarter as
a whole, wages were up at an 8-3/4 per cent annual rate. Reflecting
January's minimum wage hike, wage rate increases during the quarter were
largest in the trade sector.
Early reports on the agreement being negotiated by the Teamsters
union and the trucking industry representatives indicate a settlement
increasing wages and benefits by about 30 per cent over the three years
of the contract (assuming a 7-1/2 per cent inflation rate). The settle-
ment appears to be within the Administration's modified pay standard, which
allows exemptions for maintaining the costs of existing pension and
health benefits as well as for a portion of retroactive cost-of-living
increases.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPENTS
Aggregate credit flows to domestic nonfinancial sectors in March
continued at the slightly reduced pace established earlier in the year.
Business borrowing at banks tapered off after expanding rapidly in January
and February, but a surge in commercial paper issuance offset the weakness
in bank loans. In long-term markets, public offerings of bonds by nonfinan-
cial firms increased only slightly, and the quarterly total of such issues
was one of the smallest since 1973. These borrowing patterns have raised
the ratio of short- to long-term debt outstanding for nonfinancial corpora-
tions almost to its 1974 peak.
Net mortgage lending at S&Ls and banks declined in February and,
at banks, appears to have weakened further in March. State and local govern-
ments increased their gross borrowing in March, channeling much of the pro-
ceeds into the home mortgage market. Congressional delay in raising the
Federal debt ceiling forced the Treasury to postpone until early April a
large volume of offerings originally planned fur March. On average for the
two months, Treasury marketable borrowing is likely to be about the same as
in January and February after seasonal adjustment.
Growth in the major monetary aggregates picked up somewhat in March,
but the rates of expansion remained weak. For the quarter, measured M-1
declined--the first such quarterly contraction since 1966--and the broader
aggregates increased at rates well below those in the fourth quarter. In
March, inflows into MMCs apparently continued to support small time deposit
growth at banks and thrifts. Although outflows of savings deposits con-
tinued, the pace of withdrawals at commercial banks slowed in March.

Private short-term market interest rates generally are little
changed on balance from their levels at the time of the March FOMC meeting.
Yields on 3- and 6-month Treasury bills have risen noticeably, however, as
supplies of these instruments have been augmented by foreign central bank
sales and issuance of cash management bills by the Treasury. Long-term bond
rates have registered mixed changes in the intermeeting period, with yields
on Treasury and corporate issues edging down, while primary mortgage rates
at S&Ls increased.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M-1 grew at only a 1-3/4 per cent annual rate in March. This
small increase was not enough to offset declines in January and February,
and for the first quarter as a whole, the narrow money stock contracted
at a 2-1/4 per cent annual rate--the first quarterly decline since 1966.
Shifts of funds from demand deposits into ATS deposits and New York NOW
accounts are estimated to have reduced measured M-1 growth by about 2-3/4
percentage points in the first quarter.
M-2 growth picked up slightly in March, as a result of the M-1
increase and a reduction in the rate of outflow from commercial bank sav-
ings deposits. Over the first quarter, however, M-2 growth was quite slow,
primarily reflecting the decline in M-1 and a contraction of bank savings
deposits at an unprecedented 10 percent annual rate despite inflows into
ATS and NOW accounts.
Growth of small time deposits at commercial banks continued at a
strong pace in March for the second consecutive month. All the recent
growth in such deposits has been attributable to inflows to money market
certificates (MMCs). Following the March 15 regulatory change, which

The ultimate effect of the regulatory change on bank MMC sales is uncertain.
The removal of the ceiling differential may allow banks to attract a greater
share of MMC funds at the expense of thrift institutions; however, the elim-
ination of interest compounding on such deposits may reduce combined sales
of the certificates at the two types of institutions as some funds are
diverted to alternative market instruments. Bank data on MMCs for March are
not yet available, but unusually strong increases in small time deposits in
the last half of the month suggest that bank sales of MMCs may have picked
up. However, S&Ls reported fairly strong inflows of MMC funds throughout the
month, with the overall volume of almost $8 billion exceeding net sales in
February.
While overall growth of S&L and MSB deposits slowed in the first
quarter, the weakening of flows at credit unions has been much sharper. In
previous periods of high interest rates, CUs were able to offer the highest
rates of any insured depositary institution for accounts of less than 4-year
maturity. This advantage was lost with the introduction of the MMC in June
1978. Although CUs received authorization to issue MMCs in November 1978,
they have not heavily utilized this instrument, and at the end of February
MMC balances accounted for only 1.8 per cent of their deposits outstanding.
On a month-end basis, CU deposits fell at a 20 per cent annual rate in
January, followed by a 10 per cent rise in February (latest data available).
1/ The regulatory change eliminates the differential when yields on 6-month
Treasury bills are 9 percent or more. The effective rate that may be
paid by banks and thrifts also was lowered by a prohibition of interest
compounding.

III-6
Although market interest rates on private short-term securities
have moved dcwn since the beginning of the year, money market mutual funds
continue to attract a large volume of funds (see chart on III-7). The
growth in assets of money market mutual funds averaged about $500 million a
week during harch, only slightly less than in January and February. Industry
reports suggest that major sources of funds fcr money market mutuals have
been interest bearing deposits at banks and thrifts and, particularly for
funds sponsored by brokerage firms, the stock market.
Bank credit expansion slowed to a 3 per cent annual rate of growth
in March, about one-fifth of the average pace of the first two months of the
year. The moderation in March reflected both a sizable reduction in bank
holdings cf Treasury securities--perhaps related in part to the delay in
Treasury auctions--and less rapid loan growth. Both real estate and busi-
ness loans expanded at sharply reduced rates during the month.
Banks allowed a sizable volume of large time deposits to run off in
March, relying heavily on other managed liabilities to finance credit growth.
Nondeposit funds, including gross Eurodollar borrowings, are estimates to have
increased almost $6 billion in March, bringing the estimated first quarter
increase to $13-1/2 billion. The ratio of large time deposits and selected
nondeposit sources of funds to adjusted total assets1/ for large commercial
banks rose from 35-1/2 per cent at year-end, 1978, to an historic high of
almost 38 per cent at the end of the first quarter.
In addition, large banks are estimated to have raised more than
$4 billion (monthly average basis) in the first quarter, that was not

reflected in the borrowing ratio or other common measures of managed lia-
bilities, by liquidating claims on their foreign branches. Some of these
transfers, along with Eurodollar borrowings, reportedly were financed by
an increase in U.S. residents' deposits at offshore branches.
Business Finance
Despite the slower growth of business loans at commercial banks,
the expansion of total short- and intermediate-term business credit remained
brisk in March, bolstered by a $1.5 billion increase in commercial paper
issued by nonfinancial firms. The surge in paper issuance was entirely
attributable to industrial firms; utilities continued to tap alternative
sources of funds, including reportedly strong cash flows and long-term debt
issuance, to pay down outstanding paper in harch, as they had in the first
two months of 1979. In February, business loans at finance companies
increased $1.1 billion, most of which was automobile-related credit.
Since mid-1978, nonfinancial corporations have greatly increased
their use of short-term credit while long-term bond issuance has remained
relatively moderate. This pattern is reflected in the rapid rise in the
ratio of short-term to long-term debt outstanding of nonfinancial corpora-
tions to only marginally below its 1974 peak1/ (see chart on III-10). More-
over, rapid growth of outstanding business loan commitments at commercial
banks in late 1978 and early 1979 suggests that substantial use of this
credit source could continue. Reports from a sample of large banks asso-

stages of a business upswing. In 1973-74 this tendency was accentuated
as businesses borrowed exceptionally large amounts from banks at interest
rates held below market rates by the policy of the Committee on Interest
and Dividends. Appendix A, located at the end of this section, discusses
the profit guidelines recently announced for depositary institutions by
the Council on Wage and Price Stability.

ciate the recent growth in loan commitments primarily with larger external
financing needs of businesses and desires by firms to assure continued
credit availability.1/
Some relaxation in short-term business loan pricing at the largest
banks appears to have occurred during February, according to the Survey of
the Terms of Bank Lending. More than one-fourth of the large business loans
made by thirteen money center banks carried below-prime interest rates (see
table on III-12). This is consistent with reports of big firms being given
the option to peg the interest rate on their bank borrowings either to the
domestic prime rate or to LIBOR--or more recently to other domestic money
market rates. The increased below-prime pricing for large loans at money
center banks, which may reflect stiffened competition from foreign banks and
the commercial paper market, was not matched at the large nonmoney center
banks or the other banks participating in the survey. Loan customers of
those banks typically do not have as wide access to alternative sources of
short-term credit as do those of the money center banks. In addition, lower
liquidity of the smaller and regional banks--as evidenced by their high loan-
to-deposit ratios--may have made them less eager to increase their loans.
In long-term markets, gross public offerings of bonds by nonfinan-
cial corporations increased somewhat in March over the previous month's total,
as a smaller volume of issues by public utilities was more than offset by
an increase in offerings by industrial concerns. Despite the increase,
public offerings of bonds by nonfinancial corporations in the first quarter
of 1979 were the smallest quarterly total in current dollars since mid-1973.
1/ Additional information regarding businesses' expected use of these commit-
ments, sources of the strength in their volume, and commitment terms, based
on a survey by the bank contact group, is discussed in Appendix B of the
this section.

Corporate bond offerings by financial concerns grew sharply in March. Most
of these issues were intermediate- and longer-term issues by finance com-
panies, the proceeds of which were used in part to reduce outstanding com-
mercial paper and other short-term indebtedness.
Stock offerings contracted in March to their smallest monthly
total in almost 5 years. As in other recent months, public utilities
accounted for most of the new issues. Stock prices of NYSE-listed issues
have increased approximately 3 per cent since the March FOMC meeting, while
issues listed on the AMEX and traded in the over-the-counter market have
climbed about 5 and 4 percent, respectively. The strong showing of AMEX-
listed stocks--which raised the AMEX Composite index to a record level--
reflects in part the relatively high proportion of smaller domestic and
Canadian oil and gas exploration companies listed on this exchange, as well
as companies engaged in the extraction of primary metals. The recent sharp
increase in energy and raw materials prices appears to have improved investor
expectations of the earnings prospects for these companies.
Government Securities Markets
State and local governments sold $4.2 billion (SA) of long-term
debt obligations in March, an increase of $1.6 billion from January and
February, but close to the average monthly volume in 1978. Revenue bonds--
approximately half of which were tax-exempt mortgage bonds issued by cities,
counties, and State housing agencies1/-accounted for three-quarters of the
March total. Approximately two-thirds of funds raised by State housing
agencies and all of the funds raised by cities and counties through sales

of mortgage bonds in March was intended for single-family mortgage financing.
Net of bonds issued for mortgage financing and advance refunding purposes--
proceeds from which are channeled to financial markets rather than used for
capital outlays--tax-exempt bond volume in the first quarter was somewhat
below the pace of last year.
In part because of the heavy volume, yields on mortgage revenue
bonds increased approximately 20 basis points during March. In contrast, the
Bond Buyer index of yields on general obligation bonds declined from 6.42 to
6.28 per cent, with demand for tax-exempt issues by property and casualty
insurance companies reported to be very strong.
Treasury debt operations after mid-March were disrupted by the
failure of Congress to act on the national debt ceiling. Six offerings
of Treasury securities, involving a total volume of more than $16 billion,
were postponed after March 20. To meet impending cash needs, the Treasury
took several emergency steps in late March that included selling $2.6
billion of special nonmarketable certificates to the Federal Reserve on
March 31--the maximum amount possible without exceeding the ceiling--and
requesting that the Federal Reserve advance by one day its monthly payment
of earnings to the Treasury.
The cancellation of Treasury auctions in late March resulted
in some downward pressures on short-term Treasury yields, but the situation
was quickly reversed after the debt ceiling legislation was passed on April 2.
The Treasury auctioned $25.2 billion in new securities in the first week
of April (of which $13 billion were short-dated cash management bills)

and sold $1.5 billion of reopened 15-year bonds the following week.
The proceeds of these auctions were used to roll over several outstanding
issues maturing in early April, to repay the special borrowing from the
Federal Reserve, and to meet expenditures prior to the April tax date.
In March, Federally-sponsored credit agencies borrowed $2.6 bil-
lion, which lifted borrowing for the quarter to a record $8.8 billion. The
high volume in agency borrowing was accounted for by large financings by
both the Farm Credit Agencies and the housing agencies. While new mortgage
commitments at FNMA are down sharply from the pace set in 1978, the agency
still has a high volume of outstanding commitments and made sizable net
purchases of mortgages during the first quarter. The increase in borrow-
ing by the FHL Banks has been directed toward improving their liquidity,
as advances to S&Ls for the first quarter have continued at about the pace
of the second half of last year, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Mortgage and Consumer Credit
Net mortgage lending by banks and S&Ls declined in February to a
level approximately 30 per cent below the November peak. In March, bank lend-
ing slowed further, and at S&Ls, any rebound in mortgage lending in March
likely was small, following sizable cutbacks in commitment activity at these
institutions in January and February. New commitments in February were 10
to 30 percent below their volume a year earlier in all areas of the country
except the West, where the current dollar pace was about the same as last
year. Ceiling rates on government underwritten loans have constrained the
origination of FHA/VA mortgages by mortgage companies, and this has reduced
the volume of new GNMA securities entering secondary markets. Under current

III-18
market conditions, borrowers or home sellers must absorb about 5 or more
discount points on such government-underwritten loans.1/
As in past periods of reduced mortgage activity, the recent decline
in net mortgage acquisitions and commitments at S&Ls was preceded by a decline
in deposit growth at these institutions (see chart on III-19). Accumulation
of liquid assets by S&Ls has tended to moderate since the third quarter, but
the liquidity ratio has been maintained at around 9.0 percent (SA) since the
fall. In past periods, however, this ratio often had been reduced in order
to sustain mortgage lending. Its failure to decline in recent months may
reflect some reluctance on the part of S&Ls to commit to future mortgage
lending in the face of substantial uncertainty about the cost and volume of
deposit flows. In addition to supply side pressures, it is also possible that
S&Ls may have experienced some decline in the demand for mortgage credit,
accentuated by the unusually severe winter weather.
Interest rates on new commitments for 80 per cent 30-year conven-
tional home mortgages at S&Ls have increased 8 basis points since the March
FOMC meeting to a record 10.48 per cent.2/ Average yields in the national
secondary mortgage markets have changed little, on balance, during the inter-
meeting period, reflecting relatively stable conditions in the bond markets.
1/ Although borrowers are legally limited to the direct payment of 1 point
fees on government-underwritten loans, a portion of the higher point pay-
ments may be shifted to borrowers by indirect means, such as variations
in purchase price.
2/ Conventional home mortgage lending apparently was constrained in
many areas during the first quarter as yields required by lenders exceeded
usury ceilings in about a third of the states. However, restrictive rate
ceilings were removed during February in Maryland and South Carolina, and
a court ruling, in effect, has exempted most originators from the 10 per-
cent ceiling in Florida. At the end of March, ceilings in Idaho, Georgia,
and Vermont were raised above prevailing market rates.

The growth of consumer instalment credit outstanding increased
slightly in February from the reduced January pace. Harsh weather conditions
and related flatness in retail sales likely contributed to weaker credit
growth during these months. Consumer debt burdens--as measured by the ratio
of repayments to disposable income--edged up in February.
Consumer finance rates have risen noticeably since the first half
of 1978, following three years of stability or decline. The higher quota-
tions may signal a general tightening of consumer lending standards, although
limited evidence from measures of non-rate terms provide only weak confirma-
tion of restricted credit availability to consumers.

APPENDIX A
COWPS Bank Profit Margin Standard*
The Council on Wage and Price Stability (COWPS) released on
March 19 its profit standard for commercial banks, savings and loan
associations, mutual savings banks, and credit unions. Under the
standard, commercial banks and bank holding companies are requested to
limit the rate of return on adjusted total average assets (ROA) or the
rate of return on average equity (ROE) in 1979 to no more than the average
of the best 3 of the 5 preceding calendar years. 1/ If a bank or bank
holding company cannot meet either the ROA or ROE standard for 1979
then it is requested to both (a) limit per-share cash dividends during
the year beginning March 15, 1979 to no more than 107 per cent of the
per-share dividends during the preceding 12 months, and (b) hold constant
service charges and fees (other than interest and related charges) over
the same period.
The Board staff estimates that approximately 37 per cent of banks
with less than $1 billion in assets, and 28 per cent of banks with
$1 billion or more in assets, would have to achieve a decline in their
1979 ratios (below that of 1978) in order to bring them down to the best
3 out of 5 year average. Also, the smaller banks are likely to need larger
percentage declines in their 1979 ratios than the larger banks. Com-
pliance with the profit standard may be rendered somewhat more difficult
by continuing high market rates during 1979, which will tend to maintain
or improve profit margins. 2/ Nevertheless, many of the affected insti-
tutions will be able to comply with the ROA or ROE standard by slightly
adjusting portfolios toward safer, lower-yielding instruments or by
adding to retained earnings so as to drive down ROE. Others probably
will choose to comply instead with the dividend restriction and fee
restriction guidelines.
1/ Rate of return is defined as taxable equivalent profits before tax
plus provisions for loan losses and interest lost on nonperforming
loans, excluding currency translation gain or loss net of hedging.
Adjusted total assets equals total assets minus the lesser of
(a) Federal funds sold and reverse-RPs, plus due from banks or
(b) Federal funds purchased and RPs, plus due to banks. Equity is
defined as common and preferred stock, surplus, and retained earn-
ings. The standard applies to the highest level of consolidation;
e.g., to the consolidated holding company including all domestic
and foreign operations.
2/ For smaller banks, high rate periods imply higher returns on assets
while costs of interest-inelastic deposit funds remain relatively
low. For the larger, money-market institutions, returns on both
assets and liabilities tend to rise with market rates; nevertheless,
net interest spreads for these banks typically widen with rising rates.
Thus, if market rates in 1979 remain, on average, above those of 1978,
ROAs for both large and small institutions may rise somewhat above last
year's levels.
*Prepared by John J. Mingo, Senior Research Division Officer.

III-A-2
Under the fee guideline, a bank is requested to hold constant
the (non-interest-related) charges and fees on each service it offers
its customers (excluding correspondent banking customers). However, for
a particular service a bank would be permitted to alter the mix of the
explicit fee versus implicit fee (i.e., compensating balance require-
ment) that it charges, so long as the "average cost" to the customer is
unaltered. This would allow institutions complying with the fee guide-
line some leeway in altering their pricing schemes for newly introduced
services such as ATS accounts. In complying with the dividend guideline,
banks may issue (under COWPS staff interpretations) stock dividends in
addition to the allowable 7 per cent increase in cash dividends. 1/
Thus, even for those institutions out of compliance with both the ROA
and ROE standards, satisfying the dividend and fee guidelines is not
likely to prove burdensome or to produce significant changes in operations.
Savings and loan institutions (and their holding companies)
and mutual savings banks also are unlikely to be significantly affected
by the COWPS standard, which is similar to the standard for commercial
banks. If market interest rates remain at high levels during the remainder
of 1979, the resulting high cost of thrifts' funds (due mainly to MMCs)
will likely contribute to a substantial decline in ROA below 1978 levels
--thus, compliance with the COWPS standard will be largely a moot issue. The
Board staff estimates that, even in the absence of any further liberalization
of deposit rate ceilings, the ROAs of S&Ls and MSBs will be significantly
below their best 3 out of 5 year industry average. Finally, credit unions
are not likely to be significantly affected by the profit margin guidelines,
because their average ROA (as defined by COWPS) in 1978 was substantially
below previous years and could rise by as much as 32 per cent in 1979
without violating the profit margin standard.
1/ Many stock analysts believe that steady growth in dividends per
share is necessary to maintain P/E ratios. Apparently, stock and
cash dividends are substitutes for such purposes. There is, however,
no empirical evidence linking pay-out (or stock dividend) policies
to movements in P/E ratios.

APPENDIX B
Survey of Business Loan Commitment Growth at Commercial Banks*
The volume of business revolving credit and confirmed lines of
credit commitments outstanding at large commercial banks increased sharply
from mid-1978 to February 1979. Since last June, the Federal Reserve survey
of 134 large commercial banks has indicated that unused revolving credit
commitments have grown by over one-fourth and unused confirmed lines
by over one-tenth.
The large volume of unused business commitments outstanding, along
with already extensive use of managed liabilities by large commercial banks,
implies that an increase in the rate of business loan takedowns might be
associated with additional pressures on bank liquidity. In the past, non-
financial corporations' use of commercial bank loans has tended to increase
in cyclical upturns; at those times, businesses' need for external capital
grew concurrently as they attempted to postpone long-term borrowing until
interest rates receded and as they found funds less readily available from
their open market sources of short-term credit.
This appendix reports the results of a survey conducted by the
Federal Reserve Banks. In each district, four large banks with rapid growth
in outstanding revolving credit and confirmed lines of credit commitments
were asked about the sources of borrower demands and about any changes in
their own lending posture that might help account for the observed increase.
In general, the business loan commitment growth appears to have
resulted primarily from enlarged borrower demands, rather than from increased
aggressiveness by banks in marketing commitments. In most districts, however,
the effects of stronger demand were reinforced by bank efforts to expand
business loan portfolios. Borrower demand generally reflected businesses'
increased need for external funds, which was related frequently to the
expansion in their working capital requirements caused by recent sharp
price inflation. A second impetus came from businesses' use of commitments
to assure continued availability of short-term credit. In some cases, firms
perceived terms--presumably nonrate loan terms as well as commitment fee
and balance arrangements--to be more favorable now than they are likely
to be in the near future; in others, possible imposition of credit controls
was cited.
There were some differences among groups of respondents. For
instance, in the Kansas City and Dallas districts strong local economies and
the related expansion of local business activity had an important influence on
loan demand. In Kansas City and Boston, no use of commitments to assure
future credit availability was seen, while in Philadelphia this was the
most frequently mentioned factor and in Cleveland it was judged to have
become more prevalent in the fourth quarter of 1978. One of the more
striking differences arose in comparing the response of money center banks
with those of other large banks. (The recent rapid growth in total unused
commitments largely reflects the experience of the money center banks,
*Prepared by Barbara N. Opper, Economist, Banking Section, Division of
Research and Statistics.

III-B-2
as shown in the chart on III-B-3. The level of commitments at those
banks was virtually unchanged from late 1976 to the middle of 1978;
since then, it has grown far more rapidly than at other banks.) For
example, while most respondents did not attribute much of the increase
in businesses' demand for loan commitments to shifting from longer-term
financing sources, major New York banks cited this adjustment frequently,
and especially as characteristic of utilities' behavior. Another distinc-
tion of the money center institutions was that increased commitment demand
from their customers associated with mergers and acquisitions. Finally,
a number of respondents indicated that increased borrower needs for
confirmed lines commitments were associated with commercial paper sales.
Larger demand for loan commitments generally was attributed to
expanded loan requirements of existing customers, although in most
districts the emergence of new bank customers also added to commitment
strength. No pattern was apparent with respect to a dominant size or
industry of loan customers except that utilities and energy-related firms
increased their loan commitments from banks in a number of districts.
In most districts more aggressive bank business loan marketing
was believed only to have supplemented the growth caused by the shift in bor-
rower demands. Banks in Oklahoma and New England, however, believed
their commitment growth had resulted mainly from their stepped up marketing
efforts. Most respondents had moved to more aggressive loan marketing,
either through larger or more sophisticated staffing or in some cases
by lowering commitment fees or balance requirements. Only in the Atlanta
district was there no move toward more intensive marketing efforts by
any respondents. Kansas City district respondents referred to the need
to meet vigorous competition from New York, Chicago, and Dallas banks.
Most money center banks reported some changes in their marketing, either
in terms of responding to competitive pressures or taking steps to expand
market shares; some examples of the latter include a competitive pricing
program and small business base rate, shading of the prime rate, and
improving staffing or organization. 1/
Most respondents expected the proportion of loans acquired from
outstanding unused commitments to remain about unchanged from current
levels. Most of those expecting variations from the current rate neither
anticipated those differences to be large nor uniformly above or below the
present rate, but some respondents stressed that the course of the economy
was an important determinant of commitment utilization.
1/ Over the past year, the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on bank
Lending Practices has indicated a progressive tightening in lending
policies, but this trend has been less prevalent at major money center
banks than at other banks. Moreover, the appearance that loan marketing
among the banks recently contacted informally by the Federal Reserve
Banks was more aggressive than the posture suggested by the Senior
Loan Officer Survey can be attributed in part to a bias introduced
by the fact that Federal Reserve Staff questioned only those banks
with rapid loan commitment growth.

APPENDIX C
Revenue Bond Financing of Single-Family Mortgages*
The volume of tax-exempt bonds issued for mortgage financing pur-
poses in March was $1.5 billion, bringing the monthly average for the first
quarter to $850 million, a substantial increase from averages of $570 mil-
lion in the second half of 1978 and $380 million in the first half of last
year (see table III-C-1). Forty percent of the first quarter total repre-
sented bonds issued by cities and counties to finance single-family mortgages
for low- and middle-income households; prior to July 1978 these entities did
not issue any mortgage revenue bonds. State housing finance agencies (HFAs),
too, have stepped up their support of mortgage markets over the past year.
Moreover, these agencies, which since their inception in tne late 1960's
have concentrated on providing government-subsidized multi-family housing for
low-income households, have shifted emphasis recently toward single-family
mortgage financing programs aimed more at middle-income households. Thus,
there has been a marked increase in the quantity of funds being raised in
tax-exempt markets and channeled to single-family mortgages.
In large measure, this trend began in July 1978, when Chicago
became the first city to issue tax-exempt bonds for the purpose of financing
single-family mortgage loans--an activity exempt from the restrictions placed
on industrial development bonds by the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act
of 1968 The success of the Chicago issue and the subsequent tightening of
mortgage markets have induced many other cities and counties to follow suit--
with the encouragement of securities underwriters.
Typically, under a local government mortgage program, the bond
proceeds are distributed by a trustee--to date only banks have performed
this role--to selected financial institutions, which originate mortgages
that meet the program's constraints. (These programs are often called
"pass-throughs.") The mortgages are then held by the trustee, but the
originating financial institutions continue to service them, remitting
principal and interest payments to the trustee, which then makes principal
and interest payments to the bondholders. Because the mortgages are held
in trust, they do not show up on the balance sheets of the private finan-
cial institutions, but rather on that of the bond issuer. However, local
jurisdictions incur no liability on the bonds, which are secured by the
mortgages, insurance on the mortgage pool as well as the homeowners'
policies, and reserve funds equaling about 15 percent of the bond issue--
rather than by the "full faith and credit" of the issuer.
Such local tax-exempt bonds were sold at a net interest cost of
around 7 percent in the first quarter, and mortgages have been extended at
rates ranging from 7-7/8 percent to 8-1/2 percent, or more than 200 basis
points less than prevailing conventional mortgage rates. The mortgage rates
under tax-exempt programs are set a given number of basis points over the
borrowing rate to allow for custodial and servicing fees paid to the finan-
cial institutions, but under Internal Revenue Service arbitrage regulations

III-C-3
the spread can not exceed 150 basis points. Mortgage borrowers also pay lump
sum origination and participation fees at closing, which often have exceeded
those associated with conventional mortgages.
State HFAs usually make forward commitments to private lenders
for the financing of single-family mortgages that conform to terms estab-
lished by the HFA. Once the mortgages are originated, they are either sold
to the HFA in mortgage-purchase programs, or are retained by the lender in
loan-to-lender programs. In the latter case, the loans would remain on the
balance sheets of the originating financial institutions.
Bonds issued by a state HFA are serviced from revenues derived
from the entire mortgage portfolio of the agency, and in addition, usually
represent a "moral obligation" of the housing agency. The bonds do not,
however, constitute a liability of the state or a pledge of its full faith
and credit or taxing power.
Proponents assert that the tax-exempt mortgage bond programs bene-
fit the home buyer, the locality, and the housing industry. It is claimed
that low down-payments and low interest rates make home ownership affordable
to more people. As a result, local neighborhoods are stabilized and, with
demand pushing house prices higher, the tax base of the locality is enhanced.
In general it would appear that these programs should increase the
overall supply of mortgage credit and thereby strengthen the demand for hous-
ing. To the extent that the low-cost mortgages are extended to borrowers
who otherwise would not be able to obtain mortgage financing, the demand for
single-family residences would be increased directly. For the most part, how-
ever--with the programs having involved many middle-income households--loans
made with bond proceeds probably have substituted to a considerable extent for
conventional financing that otherwise would have occurred.1 This substitution
would increase the availability of credit to other borrowers, putting downward
pressures on mortgage rates. The lower mortgage rates, in turn, would also
stimulate the demand for housing. Of course, the additional savings allocated
to the mortgage markets through this device are unavailable for use elsewhere,
and yields on other assets would likely rise.
Much of the concern expressed about the use of tax-exempt bonds to
finance housing revolves around their impact on borrowing costs to State and
local governments for other purposes, the revenue loss to the Treasury, and
the appropriateness of tax-exempt borrowing for this purpose.
An increase in the supply of mortgage revenue bonds could raise
interest costs on other tax-exempt issues. This would occur because the
demand for tax-exempt securities is derived from desires to reduce taxable
income, and yields must rise to attract investors in lower marginal tax
1/ Such borrowers, who would have had access to conventional credit, may
however have purchased more expensive homes or assumed larger mortgages than
they otherwise would have.

III-C-4
brackets to purchase a greater supply. With the use of mortgage revenue
bonds putting downward pressures on conventional mortgage yields, an increase
in the supply of these bonds would cause the ratio of tax-exempt yields to
conventional mortgage rates to increase. Although a rise in this ratio
might reduce to some degree the attractiveness to cities and counties of
issuing bonds for mortgage financing purposes, it seems likely that an extra-
ordinarily large volume of these bonds would be necessary to eliminate the
incentive to issue them. And thus, their volume may well continue to grow.
However, the pace of expansion may moderate from the very high March level,
since March's volume appeared to reflect in part the initial response of
local governments to changes in state laws permitting them to issue mort-
gage revenue bonds and the increasing likelihood that Federal regulatory
restrictions soon will be placed on the issuance of these bonds.
Much of the discussion about potential restrictions involves the
question of whether state and local bonds issued to provide low-interest
mortgage financing for middle-income households abuse the Federal tax-exemp-
tion feature. This exemption is tantamount to a Federal subsidy, and custom
and legal precedent prescribe that governmental expenditures be for public
purposes. It is argued that a subsidy to middle-income households for home
purchases yielding only private benefits does not meet this test. Moreover,
the net benefits of these programs appear to be heavily weighted toward the
middle and upper ends of the income scale. The mortgage loans are reported
to have gone mostly to middle-income households, and net gains to investors
from the rise in the volume of tax-exempt borrowing and yields on tax-exempt
bonds accrue mostly to upper-income taxpayers.
A number of recommendations have been made as to how Congress could
limit the issuance of mortgage revenue bonds by restricting the use of the
bond proceeds to a narrower purpose, such as lending only to low- and moder-
ate-income households or in depressed areas. In these instances the program
presumably would be overcoming allocative inefficiencies or yielding other
social benefits. An indirect method of limiting the bond programs to accommo-
date low- to moderate-income households is to require home buyers to choose
between participating in a state or local mortgage bond program and taking
the current mortgage interest tax-deduction. Alternatively, the issuance of
tax-exempt mortgage bonds could be permitted only for state and local housing
agencies established by state legislation. In this way, state legislatures
would be left to correct abuses and to impose reasonable restraints on the
programs. The Administration has expressed concern about the potential
proliferation of mortgage revenue bonds and recommended in the President's
recent budget message that their issuance be limited; a specific proposal
has not yet been offered.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. During the last half of March,
the dollar's weighted-average value fluctuated only slightly and on balance
experienced almost no change. There was, however, strong underlying upward
pressure on the dollar's value,
.At the
beginning of April the upward pressure intensified, and the dollar's value
rose to a new level about 3/4 of a per cent above the old one, where it
has remained to date
.The reasons for the increase in market
demand for dollars are difficult to pinpoint, but persistent slow growth
in U.S. monetary aggregates and the OPEC ministers' oil-price increase at
the end of March may have caused market participants to revise their outlook.
The dollar's value increased against most currencies by much more than its
average rise, but increases in the value of sterling and the Canadian dollar,
whose relative prospects were brightened by the OPEC announcement, held
down the increase in the dollar's average value.
The upward trends in the values of sterling and the Canadian
dollar have been apparent for several weeks, and they have accelerated since
the oil-price increase in late March.
.In addition, the Bank of England lowered its
minimum lending rate from 13 per cent to 12 per cent on April 5 in an
effort to relieve upward pressure on sterling.
The yen has been under downward pressure at least since the
collapse of the Iranian government and has declined about 2-3/4 per cent
against the dollar the last four weeks. The pressure has developed not only

IV -2
because of Japan's dependence on imported energy supplies, but also because
the country's trade surplus has shrunk more rapidly than was expected and
price increases in Japan in recent months have been larger than were
anticipated.
.The Swiss franc has also moved downward
against the dollar, for similar reasons as, but by a lesser amount than the
yen. Switzerland is particularly dependent on the exceptionally high-priced
oil sold on the spot market.
U.S. intervention since mid-March has been almost-entirely in
marks and Swiss francs.

Those proceeds were used to accelerate the repayment schedule for Swiss-
franc-denominated debt (System swap drawings and Treasury securities)
incurred before August 15, 1971. The final payments on each debt were
made March 30. Losses associated with the operation since August 1971
amounted to $840 million for the System and about $1-1/4 billion for the
Treasury.
The Desk has purchased $2.8 billion marks
since mid-March and the funds have been used to reduce
outstanding System swap commitments to $624 million.

U.S. bank lending abroad. In the second half of 1978 U.S. bank
(domestic and foreign office) claims on countries other than international
financial centers continued to increase more slowly than in the preceding
year. Claims on financial centers, however, again rose more than in the
comparable period of 1977. For 1978 as a whole, total claims rose about
$36 billion (adjusted to the extent possible for reporting changes in the
spring of last year), compared with about $32 billion in 1977. This
relatively moderate step-up in U.S. banks' international lending con-
trasted with the surge in lending by non-U.S. banks, whose claims on
foreign countries (excluding the United States) rose six times more in
the first nine months of 1978 than in the year-earlier period.
U.S. banks' net new lending to countries other than interna-
tional financial centers -- where borrowers generally employ the funds
internally rather than relend them abroad -- increased $7.4 billion in
the second half of 1978, compared with $9.8 billion a year earlier.
Claims on the smaller developed countries, the non-oil developing coun-
tries and Eastern Europe all rose more slowly while there was some
acceleration in lending to oil-exporting countries. There was a leveling
or actual decrease in claims on a number of important borrowers, including
a further drop in claims on Mexico. The indebtedness of Mexican borrowers
to U.S. banks at the end of 1978 was down about $1.1 billion (adjusted)
from the level of June 1977, whereas non-U.S. banks increased their
claims on Mexico by $5 billion between June 1977 and September 1978. The
year-over-year deceleration in lending to countries other international
financial centers in the second half of 1978 approximated that of the

1978-II 1) exclusion of customer claims and foreign-currency claims from claims
reported by domestic offices (amounting to $9.1 billion in June 1978); 2) reduction
'- number of reporting foreign branches; 3) new reporting instructions for foreign
inches which shifted more claims into the "unallocated" category.

first half. For all of 1978, claims on this group of countries appear
to have risen about $12 billion adjusted for reporting changes (see foot-
note 2 to table) compared with $16.5 billion in 1977.
In contrast to the foregoing, the increases in claims on inter-
national financial centers were larger in both halves of 1978 than in the
respective year-earlier periods, and for 1978 as a whole these claims and
miscellaneous claims rose an estimated $24 billion (adjusted) compared
with $15 billion in 1977. International bank lending data compiled by
the BIS show that the redirection of U.S. bank lending in 1978 -- i.e.,
the increase in net new lending to financial centers and the decline in
lending to the other areas -- was basically consistent with the interna-
tional lending behavior of non-U.S. banks which, although they did not
slow down their new lending to countries other than international finan-
cial centers, nevertheless increased it less rapidly than their lending
to international financial centers (on the basis of nine months' data).
The 1978 increase in total foreign claims of U.S. banks was
only about $5 billion, or 15 per cent, more than the increase occuring
in 1977. The modest dimensions of this rise contrast with the several-
fold step-up in the dollar value of net new lending to foreigners by
non-U.S. banks, as shown by data covering the first nine months of 1978.
The external claims of non-U.S. banks in the G-10 countries, Switzerland,
Austria, Denmark, and Ireland increased $89 billion in the first three
quarters of 1978 compared with $14 billion in the same period of 1977.
(These figures exclude increases of $9 billion and $7 billion, respec-
tively, in those banks' claims on the United States.) The following

IV -7
figures compare these increases, and the September 1978 outstandings,
with those for U.S. banks for the same periods adjusted to a BIS basis
(in billions of dollars):

In part the much greater increase by the non-U.S. banks reflects the
larger share in their assets of claims denominated in non-dollar curren-
cies, which increased in value relative to the dollar, but this would
not appear to be the major explanation. The disparity between the U.S.
and non-U.S. banks' lending experiences is consistent with reports that
U.S. banks have become less aggressive, especially relative to German
and Japanese banks, in seeking international business.

U.S. International Transactions. The merchandise trade deficit
in February was $20.5 billion at an annual rate (international accounts basis),
about half the size of the large January deficit. Exports were about
unchanged, but both oil and nonoil imports declined sharply. The deficit
for January-February combined was $29.7 billion, somewhat larger than the
annual rate of deficit in the fourth quarter of 1978.
Total exports in January-February rose by about 2 per cent from
the fourth-quarter rate. Agricultural exports fell as expected, with a
drop in grain shipments. Poor harvests in the Southern Hemisphere that had
boosted U.S. agricultural exports during 1978 were, with the exception of
the Brazilian soybean crop, much improved this year. Nonagricultural
exports in January-February rose on the strength of increased shipments of
automotive equipment, chemicals, and aircraft. Machinery exports, which
had risen steadily through 1978, were virtually flat.
Total imports in January-February increased by about 4 per cent
from the fourth-quarter rate. Over half of the increase was in non-oil
imports. Increases in capital goods, consumer goods, and Canadian automotive
products were partly offset by declines in foods, industrial supplies, and
automotive products from Europe and Japan.
Oil imports remained high in February, although down from the
January rate. For January-February, oil imports averaged 9.5 million
barrels per day (mbd), compared with an average of 8.7 mbd for 1978. Oil

imports from Iran fell by one-half in January-February, but this was more
than offset by increased imports from other countries, primarily Venezuela,
Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Mexico. Given the normal shipping lag, imports
from Iran are likely to have fallen to near zero in March and are likely to
remain at that level through April. However, at the end of March U.S.
petroleum stocks were about normal for this time of year. The average
price of a barrel of imported oil rose to $13.77 in February from an
average of $13.35 in the fourth quarter of 1978. Again because of shipping
lags, this price rise only partially reflects the 5 per cent price increase
imposed by OPEC on January 1 and was influenced little if at all by the rash
of surcharges imposed during the Iranian revolution.

On March 27, OPEC announced a 9 per cent increase in oil prices as
of April 1 to $14.54 per barrel, the level previously planned for October 1.
In addition, OPEC agreed that members could impose additional surcharges.
Since then, several OPEC countries have announced surcharges ranging from
$1.20 to $4.00 per barrel. The average surcharge imposed on a barrel of
oil imported into the United States is likely to be about 80 cents above
the normal average premium of 60 cents per barrel. (The United States
imports oil of a higher average quality than the OPEC marker crude.) These
increases will not be reflected fully in U.S. import unit values until
June at the earliest, when the oil import unit value is expected to reach
$16 per barrel.
The United States promised early in March at a meeting of the
International Energy Association to cut oil imports by 5 per cent from what
they otherwise would have been by the end of 1979. President Carter, in his
energy message on April 5, outlined how this might be accomplished. He
announced that oil prices would be decontrolled gradually between June 1
of this year and September 30, 1981. Decontrol, besides providing an
incentive for increased domestic production, will encourage energy conserva-
tion by gradually ending the subsidy on oil imports, thereby bringing the
U.S. price up to the world level. This subsidy averaged $1.60 per barrel
in 1978 and would have risen to about $3.00 in 1979. The subsidy arises from
the entitlements scheme whereby refiners with greater than average access to

IV-12
price-controlled U.S. crude oil make payments to those with greater than
average dependence on imported crude oil.
The offset to the official capital outflow, as well as the current
account deficit (which is estimated at about $3 billion in the first quarter),
has been a large private capital inflow. The data now available show
sizeable net inflows through U.S. banks -- about $10 billion in January-
February -- but there is also evidence that there have been some outflows
of funds by non-banks to acquire Eurodollar deposits.
Hence, there may have been a substantial inflow through the non-
bank sector -- very likely reflecting a shift in financing that reversed the
outflow in the last half of 1978 when the dollar was weak. These inflows
are likely to have occurred largely through inter-company accounts and
through an increase in outstanding loans by foreign institutions to U.S.
corporations. These shifts substitute foreign credit or reduced claims on
foreigners for domestic credit to U.S. companies.

IV-13
The sizable increase in Eurodollar deposits by U.S. non-banks
that occurred in January and apparently continued in February represents
both an increase in direct deposits placed by U.S. investors and growth
in the marketing of Eurodollar CDs by money market funds. In January-February
foreign branches of U.S. banks reported a $4 billion increase in their
liabilities to U.S. residents other than banks. It is likely that
additional liabilities to U.S. residents were sold through foreign brokers
and went unreported. In addition, first-quarter data are not yet available
on dollar deposits of U.S. nonbank residents at the offices abroad of
foreign-owned banks.
In recent months, U.S. residents have also increased their offshore
dollar deposits through the investments of money market mutual funds. At
the end of October, Eurodollar CDs represented only 3.7 per cent of the total
assets of money market funds; by the end of March this share had increased
to 6-1/2 per cent, about $1.1 billion. Over the same period, the per cent
of total money market mutual fund assets invested in domestic CDs fell from
43.4 to 36 per cent. The reduced attractiveness of domestic CDs to money
market funds is attributable, in part, to the increased return differential
brought about by the two per cent supplementary reserve requirement on large-
denomination time deposits at the domestic offices of member banks imposed
on November 1.

Foreign Economic Developments. The intensification of inflation
rates continues to dominate economic developments in most major industrial
countries. Wholesale price inflation is at a high level in the six major
foreign industrial countries. An important element in this widespread
acceleration of wholesale prices is the sharp rise in international com-
modity prices, especially metal prices. As measured by the Economist index,
which weights commodity prices by developed-country imports, metal prices,
measured in dollars, jumped 27 per cent (not seasonally adjusted) between
November 1978 and the middle of March 1979. In addition, food-price
increases, due to severe weather in Europe, contributed to the accelera-
tion in inflation.
Consumer price inflation has also generally intensified this year.
The weighted-average price increase for ten foreign industrial countries
between the fourth quarter of 1978 and the first two months of 1979 was
about 8-1/2 per cent (annual rate), more than double the increase between
the third and fourth quarters of 1978.
A moderate expansion in output in 1979 is still expected even
though seasonally-adjusted industrial production indexes show weakness.
In Japan, industrial production dropped in February (to slightly below
its December level), but labor market conditions appear to be improving
significantly. In Germany industrial production fell by about 1.7 per
cent between December and February after being flat for three consecutive
months. However, other indicators point to stronger German activity:
the unemployment rate has been steadily declining since last summer and
in March was at its lowest level since early 1975, and capacity utilization
has steadily increased over the same period.

The Japanese current-account surplus in February narrowed further,
indicating the continuation of the international adjustment process. The
current-account surplus for the first two months of 1979 was at a $3 billion
annual rate compared with a $16-1/2 billion surplus in 1978. On the other
hand, the German external position has not moved towards balance. The
external situation of the other major industrial countries also have not
recorded any significant recent changes.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, the authorities have begun
to take steps to control inflationary pressures which have become evident
in recent months. For the second quarter in a row the increase in autho-
rized lending limits for large city banks in the April-June quarter will
be significantly below (by more than 10 per cent) the increase of the same
quarter of the previous year. Wholesale prices in the first quarter of
1979 averaged 1.9 per cent higher than the previous quarter because of
stronger domestic demand, higher foreign commodity prices, and the depre-
ciation of the yen. Consumer prices were relatively stable through
February, but rose 0.9 per cent in March.
According to recently-released national income data for the
fourth quarter, real GNP (s.a.) rose at an annual rate of 6.8 per cent,
despite a decline in net exports of 1-1/2 per cent (expressed as a
fraction of the previous quarter's GNP). Private plant and equipment
expenditures, which rose sharply, and private consumption made partic-
ularly strong contributions to the growth of domestic demand in the
fourth quarter. There are indications that labor market conditions may
be improving significantly with the expansion of the domestic economy.
In January, the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate fell to 2.1 per

IV -20
cent for the first time since last March, and preliminary information
suggests that the February unemployment rate was lower still. At the
same time, the index of the ratio of job offers to applicants rose 10
per cent in the three months ending in February. The index of indus-
trial production (s.a.), fell sharply in February, however, to slightly
below its December level.
Japan continues to make progress in reducing its current-
account surplus, which in February was only $305 million (s.a., includ-
ing about $290 million in emergency imports). In recent months, import
volume has been running at levels more than 12 per cent above levels of
a year ago. In February the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
announced the continuation in FY1979 of its program of administrative
guidelines to restrain the level of total exports.
In Germany, the main concern at present is inflation. The
consumer price index, not seasonally adjusted, rose at a 8.9 per cent
annual rate in the first quarter of 1979. This represents a signifi-
cant acceleration although seasonal factors account for much of the
increase: the seasonally-adjusted CPI rose at a 4.9 per cent annual
rate in the first quarter. Wholesale and producers price indices have
also recorded sharp accelerations so far this year. Areas of partic-
ularly sharp price increases are petroleum products and food. In
addition, import prices, which had been falling sharply last year,
rose 5 per cent between December and February.
On the activity side, the best news has been the slight decline
of the seasonally-adjusted rate of unemployment, to 4.1 per cent in
February, from 4.0 in January; on the basis of preliminary indications,

IV -21
the rate is even lower in March. Unemployment is at its lowest level
since early 1975. Similarly, a recent survey of capacity utilization
shows a steady rate of increase from last summer through January. Order
figures (seasonally adjusted) regained their December level in February,
after falling in January. Industrial production, on the other hand, fell
in both January and February and is now at its level of last summer.
The growth of central bank money slowed in February to a rate
which is more in line than previous months with the Bundesbank's target
for 1979. But M1, M2 and M3 are all growing once more at rates comparable
to the high rates of late last year, and domestic demand for credit is
very high. On March 29, the Bundesbank consequently raised the discount
and lombard rates each by 1 per cent to 4 and 5 per cent respectively.
At the same time rediscount quotas were raised by DM 5 billion in order
to enable the banks to reduce their high Lombard indebtedness without
excessive strain on their liquidity position. Moreover, the Bundesbank
recently has acted to limit the restrictive monetary effect of inter-
vention purchases of marks by engaging in swap operations (selling
marks spot and buying forward), and also by switching some of its
intervention to the forward market.
The trade current account surpluses, (both not seasonally
adjusted), for the first two months of 1979, while significantly lower
than November -December of last year, were virtually unchanged compared
to the year ago level.
In the United Kingdom, the index of industrial production (s.a.)
dropped sharply in January to a level 6 per cent below that prevailing in
December. Although the decrease reflects the truckdrivers' strike and

IV -22
unusually adverse weather conditions during the month, it may also indicate
a further weakening in economic activity. The volume of retail sales (s.a.)
in January dropped sharply as well, but recovered somewhat in February.
On March 28, the U.K.'s Labour government lost a vote of confi-
dence and Parliament was dissolved on April 4. Parliamentary elections
are scheduled for May 3. The British budget for fiscal year 1979-80 --
which was to have been announced on April 3 -- has been postponed until
after the elections.
Recent French data indicate that output in early 1979 was about
5-1/2 per cent higher than a year earlier, and that inflation was running
at a 9-10 per cent annual rate. According to preliminary data, GDP in
1978 rose by 3.2 per cent over 1977. The balance-of-payments data for
all of 1978 show a substantial turnaround from 1977. The trade account
moved from a deficit of $2.2 billion to a surplus of $0.7 billion, with
the current account showing a surplus of $4.2 billion in 1978, compared
with a $3.3 billion deficit in 1977. The trade account benefitted,
especially, from favorable terms-of-trade developments last year. The
government expects another external surplus in 1979, despite the recent
additional oil-price increase.
France's unemployment situation, related, in part, to the
government's attempts to rationalize the steel industry, has aroused
widespread opposition. Unemployment is around 1.3 million and rising
slowly. Despite protest demonstrations and setbacks in the nationwide
March 25 cantonal elections, however, the government has so far resisted
any basic changes in the course of its rationalization programs.
The resurgence of inflation in Italy in January continued into
February. The wholesale price index rose for the second consecutive month

IV -23
by 1.7 per cent (not seasonally adjusted) with pressure coming in part from
food prices. Although consumer prices increased by less in February than
January (1.5 per cent as compared to 1.9 per cent) the absence of rent
adjustments in February was responsible for most of the improvement.
Because of the intensification of inflation, the Bank of Italy has tight-
ened the limits on the expansion of bank credit.
The strength of the economy in the last quarter of 1978 was
reflected in recently-released data which indicate that GDP rose 2.6
per cent in 1978, higher than had been previously expected; household
consumption and exports were the main sources of strength. A jump in
industrial production of 4-1/2 per cent (s.a.) in February after two
months of weakness, and survey data on new orders and inventories, point
to strong economic activity in the first part of 1979.
The current-account surplus in 1978 increased to $6.3 billion
from $2.3 billion in 1977. Strong performances for exports and tourism
account for a good part of the increase.
Industrial production in Canada rose by 0.6 per cent in January
and is now 9.8 per cent above that of the same month a year earlier. The
strength of activity was reflected in a drop of the unemployment rate to
below 8 per cent in February and March for the first time since early 1977.
Consumer prices in February were over 9 per cent above the same month a
year earlier; the non-food CPI, however, was up by less than 7 per cent.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for May 22 with the Conservatives
seriously threatening Trudeau's Liberal government; it is not clear how
economic policy would be affected by the outcome, but there are sugges-
tions that the Conservatives would re-institute an incomes policy.

In March, the Swiss National Bank moved cautiously to absorb
some of the liquidity in the money market, and interest rates have begun
to edge up from their very low levels. The stability of the Swiss franc
and low interest rates remain objectives of the Swiss monetary authorities,
however, and the shift in monetary policy is not expected to be sharp unless
the acceleration of inflation continues. In March, the consumer price index
rose by 0.5 per cent after its 1.1 per cent increase in February and whole-
sale-price increases also decelerated.
