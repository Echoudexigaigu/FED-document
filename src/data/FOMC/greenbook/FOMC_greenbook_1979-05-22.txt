The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
On balance, economic activity has been advancing at a distinctly
slower pace so far in 1979 than late last year, but the rate of inflation
has accelerated substantially. In April, retail sales continued their
sluggish performance, while payroll employment growth slowed and industrial
production fell, in part reflecting the effects of the trucking strike/
lockout. There was a weather-related rebound of spending in March for
both residential and nonresidential construction, but for housing parti-
cularly this surge is likely to be transitory. Prices in the spring
continued rising at the double-digit pace seen since the beginning of the
year with especially sharp increases in energy prices. Some slowdown
in food price increases, however, has become evident.
Employment and Production
Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 130,000 (strike adjusted) in
April--following average monthly gains of about 320,000 in the first quarter
of the year. The service-producing industries accounted for all of the
April payroll increase, while employment in the goods-producing sector was
essentially unchanged. The secondary effects of the trucking shutdown,
which ended during the reference week for the labor market surveys, probably
depressed employment. The impact of the trucking dispute appears to have
been greatest in the transportation equipment industry where employment fell
20,000. The factory workweek also was affected by the strike and by religious
holidays during the reference week. As a result, overtime hours were sharply
reduced, and in total the average workweek fell 1.7 hours to 39.1 hours.

Total employment, as measured by the household survey, declined
about 670,000 in April. This sharp drop followed average monthly increases
of almost 300,000 in the preceding 12 months. It appears that the April
decline was related to reporting difficulties as well as other special
factors and is likely to be reversed in May. A large drop in the civilian
labor force accompanied the April employment decline, and the unemployment
rate was little changed at 5.8 per cent.
Industrial production is estimated to have declined 1 per cent in
April. About three-fourths of the drop appeared in autos, trucks and
related industries. Auto makers had initially scheduled a 4 per cent
decline in April assemblies from the March rate, partly because of an
inventory overhang. As a result of the strike, however, assemblies in
April actually fell 16 per cent from March to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 7.9 million units. Preliminary reports indicate that, with sales
relatively weak at all other producers, only General Motors plans output
increases in May and June. Weekly raw steel figures show a small increase
in April, but output of finished steel was curtailed late in the month
due to a strike by steel-haulers.
With the estimated large decline in industrial production, capacity
utilization in manufacturing apparently fell more than 1 percentage point
in April to about 85 per cent. This is close to the level that prevailed
last summer, but still relatively high.

Capacity utilization for a number of industries has been quite
high recently. Indeed, before the drop in April, the utilization rate for
advanced processing industries was about the same as the 1973 peak level.
In particular, utilization rates are relatively high for certain primary
metals, fabricated metal products, electrical machinery, aerospace, rail-
road equipment, and instruments. Some of these items also have been
reported in short supply by purchasing managers in recent months.
Purchasing managers also have reported paper and paper products,
petrochemicals, and petroleum products as being in short supply. To
some extent shortages of these items result from strikes or special
factors. For example, it is estimated that about 5 per cent of basic paper
capacity had been shut down by strikes which began last summer. Moreover,
the supply disruptions reported for various petroleum products partly
reflect the earlier interruption in the flow of crude oil from Iran
and the shift of production toward increased fuel oil output. Additionally,
the supply disruptions reported for petroleum-based materials appear to
reflect regulations forcing a shift to the use of unleaded gasoline from
leaded gasoline. Production of unleaded gasoline requires more crude oil
input per unit of output than leaded gasoline and this has reduced avail-
able supplies of other refined products such as benzene and toluene--
inputs to the chemical industry.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Total personal income growth, which was depressed early in the
year, picked up in March to a 12-1/2 per cent annual rate--slightly below
the 14 per cent rise in the fourth quarter of 1978--reflecting strong

gains in private wage and salary disbursements. But with prices rising
sharply, real personal income was about unchanged in March and declined
slightly over the first quarter as a whole. Over the last year, real
personal income rose 2-1/2 per cent, somewhat below the 3 per cent trend
of the last decade.
Consumer activity continued weak in April as moderate gains in
nominal retail sales were probably about matched by the continued surge
in consumer prices. Retail sales excluding autos and mainly nonconsumer
items rose 1.1 per cent for the month. However, this gain partly reflected
a sharp price-related advance in the current dollar sales by gasoline service
stations and grocery stores. Sales at discretionary-spending type stores--
furniture and appliance, general merchandise, and apparel--declined a trifle
in April.
Total unit auto sales were at an 11.4 million unit annual rate in
April, down substantially from the rapid March selling rate, but only slightly
below the average earlier this year. Sales continued to be boosted by
increased concern about fuel efficiency, as import sales were sustained at
a brisk pace--2.6 million units--and sales of American-made small cars
held at the high March rate. In the first ten days of May, sales of domestic-
model cars were at a 9.1 million unit rate, the same as in April as a whole.
A weakening of consumer confidence has accompanied the recent
moderation of consumer spending. According to the University of Michigan
and The Conference Board surveys, consumer confidence in their economic

and financial situation dropped sharply last month to levels low by
historical standards. The Michigan survey indicates that heightened
inflationary expectations were a prime factor in this deterioration.
The April surveys also reported less optimism about buying conditions
for household durables; in addition, the surveys indicated that views about
purchasing automobiles and housing deteriorated, but remained quite high
by historical standards.
Business Fixed Investment
Investment activity rebounded substantially in March, following
the weather-related disruptions earlier in the year. Shipments of non-
defense capital goods rose 5-1/2 per cent, after little change in the pre-
ceding two months. In the first quarter, these shipments advanced 5-1/2
per cent, about 1 percentage point faster than the fourth quarter rise. Non-
residential construction put-in-place also snapped back noticeably in March,
after declining in the first two months of the year; nonetheless for the
first quarter as a whole, growth of such building activity was below the
average pace recorded during 1978.
Advance indicators of capital spending still appear to suggest
some slowing in investment demand over the course of this year. In the
construction area, commitments for new commercial and industrial buildings
remain strong, but recent trends in nonbuilding commitments (primarily
power plants and pipelines) indicate some weakness. Contracts for new
building activity climbed 10-1/2 per cent in the first quarter, about

in line with the rise over 1978. In contrast, the value of contracts for
private nonbuilding projects has been declining since early 1978 and activity
in this sector will likely temper the strength in overall construction
outlays later this year.
New orders for nondefense capital goods fell almost 3 per cent in
March, following two months of large increases. For the quarter as a whole,
these bookings were up 6.8 per cent, well below the exceptional fourth
quarter pace, but about in line with the average advance over 1978.
Machinery orders--a good indicator of underlying trends in equipment out-
lays--rose 3.9 per cent in the first quarter, less than half the rise in
the fourth quarter.
The slowing of advances in machinery orders is consistent with
a general weakening of investment growth over the course of this year
implied by the Commerce Department survey of anticipated capital outlays
taken last February. In contrast to the Commerce Department readings, which
are to be updated next month, the McGraw-Hill survey of business spending
plans suggests a more robust investment outlook. The results of this
survey, however, should be interpreted with caution. The spring survey,
which reports an upward-revised 16 per cent increase in business spending
plans in 1979, has overstated the actual change in the past three years
by an average of about 5 percentage points, and has overstated actual
spending in 24 out of the last 28 years.

Inventory Investment
Total business inventory accumulation, as measured in book value
terms, was at a generally brisk pace throughout the first quarter.
Accelerating prices continued to be a significant factor in boosting
book values as total manufacturing and trade inventories rose at a $58
billion annual rate in March; this increase was about 20 per cent faster
than the average rise in the first two months of the year. At the same
time, however, total business sales rebounded sharply from the earlier
weather-affected pace and the ratio of total book value stocks to sales
fell back below its low level of late last year.
The book value of manufacturers' inventories rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $26.2 billion in March, somewhat below the average
pace for the first two months of the year. The bulk of the March accumu-
lation was in durable goods, mainly by producers of machinery. The limited
stock-building in the nondurable goods area continued to be characterized
by relatively large increases in food products.
By stage of fabrication, the March accumulation at manufacturers
was heavily concentrated in materials and supplies, particularly fabricated
metal products and transportation equipment. This follows two months
of fairly even distribution at all stages of processing. Part of the
increase in materials inventories appears to reflect some advance building
in anticipation of a trucking strike.

II -15
In contrast to the pickup of manufacturing accumulation in the
first quarter, stock-building at the trade level was off somewhat from
the fourth quarter pace. The book value of total trade inventories rose
at a $32 billion annual rate in March, about twice as rapid as the January-
February rate. Retail stocks increased somewhat faster than last year's
average pace, following the liquidation in February; most of this increase
was at nondurable retailers where stocks had declined for three consecutive
months. Stocks of wholesale merchants rose in March at a pace somewhat
above the February rate.
Residential Construction
Housing activity improved in March, following two months of being
severely depressed by weather, but it appears to have slowed considerably
from last fall. Total private housing starts rose by almost 30 per cent
in March to a 1.8 million unit annual rate, reflecting sharp increases for
both single and multifamily units. Nonetheless, the March rate for all
units was 14 per cent below the fourth quarter starts rate, and the average
for the first quarter as a whole was 22 per cent below the fourth quarter.
Starts in all parts of the country in March were well below their
1978:QIV averages. In particular, starts in the West census region were
almost 20 per cent below the exceptionally rapid pace that generally pre-
vailed throughout 1977 and 1978. In addition, sales of existing homes in
the West remained at a low level in March and recent reports from
California suggest that gasoline shortages currently are having a further
damping effect on sales; however, new home sales in March were at a
level well above the fourth quarter rate.

For the nation as a whole, sales of both new and existing homes
were up slightly in March,rising 3 per cent from February levels. Despite
this increase, the level of sales is well below last fall's strong pace.
Even with the emerging weakness in home sales, however, builders do not
appear to be severely overstocked with unsold houses. On a seasonally
adjusted basis, homes for sale at the end of March were below the peak
reached last summer, and industry sources indicate that contractors are
continuing to be conservative about speculative building.
Government Sector
The Federal deficit (NIA basis) in the first quarter is now estimated
to have been $20 billion at an annual rate, down slightly from the previous
quarter and $32 billion below a year earlier. The declining trend is due
in part to a slowdown in the growth of Federal spending, especially for
grants to States and localities. Receipts have risen rapidly reflecting
growth in incomes. In the first quarter, total receipts rose, partly reflec-
ting the January increase in Social Security taxes. As expected, high
personal and corporate tax payments in the first quarter about offset the
tax cuts contained in the Revenue Act of 1978.
Incoming unified budget data for April indicate continuing strength
in Federal receipts, particularly for final settlements on 1978 personal tax
liabilities. These larger-than-expected tax payments and upward-revised
income assumptions have led the Administration to raise expected receipts
for fiscal year 1979 by $8 billion to $464 billion. For 1980, the receipts
estimate has been increased to $513 billion, up $11 billion from earlier
this year.

State and local government employment rose by 35,000 in April.
Hiring by these units has risen substantially since last fall, but this
has offset only about two-thirds of the job losses that occurred through-
out the country last summer following the passage of Proposition 13.
Construction outlays by State and local governments remained at a
comparatively low level in March, following sharp weather-related declines
early in the year. Consequently, the value of new construction put-in-
place was down over 5 per cent in real terms from the year-earlier level.
March investment activity was concentrated in building construction and
highway and road work, while water facility projects--the largest single
category of State and local construction--declined for the fifth month in
a row.
Prices
Recent data continue to show inflation running at a double-digit
pace in 1979. Consumer prices increased at about a 12 per cent annual rate
in March, and in April producer prices for finished goods rose at nearly
an 11 per cent rate despite some decline in food prices.
The sharpest inflation so far this year has been in the energy
sector. During the first quarter, consumer prices for both gasoline and
fuel oil rose at more than a 30 per cent annual rate, with prices accelerating
late in the quarter. The sharp price increases reflect a number of
factors, including higher OPEC crude oil prices, an apparent jump in
gasoline demand and a reduction in stocks, a relaxation of Department of

Energy gasoline pricing regulations, and a third successive cold winter
which pulled down fuel oil stocks. The indirect effects of higher OPEC
crude oil prices also have begun to be evident, particularly in April,
with accelerating producer prices for such intermediate materials as
industrial chemicals and plastic resins and materials.
Food prices at the retail level continued rising rapidly through
March, but there have been indications of a slowdown. Producer prices
for finished foods declined in April for the first time since last August--
primarily because of lower prices for vegetables, pork, and poultry and
a slower rate of increase in beef prices. At the farm level, increases
in livestock prices--an indicator of near-term retail meat prices--have
slowed from their pace of earlier months and prices of fresh vegetables
have declined sharply.
Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices rose at a 9.7
per cent annual rate in March, somewhat above the first quarter rate.
Homeownership costs, which reflect both house prices and mortgage rates,
continued to be a major factor in this rapid rise. Apparel prices also
rose sharply in March after 10 months of relatively small increases.
At the producer level, widespread large increases were evident
outside the food and energy-related sectors in April, particularly for
motor vehicles and for construction and agricultural machinery and equip-
ment. Consumer finished goods excluding food rose at close to an 18 per

II -23
cent annual rate in April; excluding gasoline and fuel oil, this component
of the index rose at about a 10 per cent rate. Intermediate materials
prices also rose quite rapidly in April.
Wages, Collective Bargaining Settlements, and Productivity
The hourly earnings index rose 0.6 per cent in April, and was up
at an 8.3 per cent annual rate during the first four months of the year--
the same pace as in 1978. The continuation of the 1978 wage trend so far
this year reflects, in part, the relatively light collective bargaining
calendar in the first quarter. Average wage rates in the second quarter,
however, will be affected by the initial impact of large first-year increases
in the recent Teamsters' contract, and will be further boosted when a
settlement is reached in the rubber industry collective bargaining negotia-
tions.
Sizable increases in compensation and a decline in productivity
have continued to put upward pressures on unit labor costs. Including the
effects of increases in the minimum wage and Social Security taxes, hourly
compensation in the nonfarm business sector rose at a 10-1/4 per cent
annual rate during the first quarter. This, combined with a sharp decline in
estimated productivity--at a 4-1/4 per cent annual rate, unit labor costs
in the nonfarm business sector were up at a 15 per cent annual rate. Over
the past year, such costs had risen at nearly a 9 per cent annual rate.
In manufacturing, a smaller decline in productivity in the first quarter
along with a 10 per cent rate rise in hourly compensation resulted in a

however, factory employment gains have been in better balance with the

in productivity has offset a large part of the compensation increases and
manufacturing labor costs advanced only 4-3/4 per cent over the last year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The volume of funds raised in credit and equity markets by private
domestic nonfinancial sectors apparently continued at a reduced level in
April following small declines during the previous two quarters. Businesses
borrowed heavily at banks and in the commercial paper market last month, but
gross offerings of bonds and stocks by nonfinancial corporations remained
moderate. Meanwhile, home mortgage borrowing by households probably held
around the first quarter pace, and issuance of tax-exempt bonds in April was
only a little above the average pace of earlier months of the year. In the
public sector, net issuance of marketable Treasury securities increased
sharply in April on a seasonally adjusted basis, reflecting to a large extent
offerings that had been postponed in March due to the delay in extending the
Federal debt ceiling. Federally sponsored credit agencies also increased
their borrowing somewhat, largely to support the residential mortgage market.
M-l increased at a record rate in April after declining in the first
quarter. Outflows of commercial bank time and savings deposits subject to
fixed-rate ceilings moderated significantly while net inflows to MMC accounts
increased. Banks were thus able to reduce their managed liabilities despite
strong bank credit expansion. Deposit growth at nonbank thrift institutions
fell sharply in April, partly reflecting a loss of MMC market share following
elimination of the rate differential over commercial banks. S&Ls borrowed
heavily from the FHLBanks to help meet takedowns from the large volume of
mortgage commitments outstanding.
Short-term market interest rates have fluctuated widely since mid-
April in response to shifting expectations about System policy. Short-term
rates generally declined around the time of the April meeting but subsequently

rose markedly following release of the unexpectedly strong money supply data
and an upward adjustment in the Federal funds rate to the 10-1/4 per cent
area. On balance, Treasury bill rates are currently close to their levels
just prior to the April meeting, and private short-term rates are unchanged
to slightly lower. In contrast, yields on most longer-term securities have
risen further since the last FOMC meeting, possibly reflecting in part a
more pessimistic inflation outlook. Rates on home mortgages also have
increased significantly.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M-1 grew at a record 17 per cent annual rate in April, finally
surpassing its level of last September. About half of the April increase
apparently reflected delays in the processing of income tax payments and a
bunching of refunds. However, continued shifts of funds from demand deposits
into ATS accounts nationally and NOW accounts in New York reduced measured
1/
M-1 growth by an estimated 2-1/2 percentage points during the month.
The recent Demand Deposit Ownership Survey suggests that both house-
holds and businesses reduced their holdings of demand deposits in the first
quarter. Deposits of individuals declined by an amount roughly equivalent
to the estimated shift of demand deposits into ATS accounts and New York NOW
accounts. In the business sector, the generally volatile demand deposits
of financial firms fell substantially, while deposits of nonfinancial busi-
nesses declined moderately despite an apparent rise at large banks. The
relative strength of business demand deposits at large banks is consistent
1/ It should be noted that April has been the month most affected by revi-
sions of seasonal factors for M-1 in recent years, and it is likely that the
April growth rates will be revised further downward when the factors are
reestimated in the future.

with the hypothesis that recent improvements in cash management techniques
1/
have been most pronounced at medium- and smaller-sized corporations.
Savings deposits at commercial banks were reduced slightly in April,
following large runoffs during the previous five months. Small time deposits
subject to fixed-rate ceilings were about unchanged in April, breaking an
extended decline since mid-1978 when MMCs were introduced. MMC accounts at
banks expanded rapidly in April, and growth of total time deposits other than
large negotiable CDs accelerated despite a sharp decline in the large-time-
deposit component of M-2. With the rise in M-1, growth in M-2 picked up to
a 13-1/2 per cent rate, the largest monthly increase since late 1976.
Net issuance of MMCs at commercial banks rose to $7-1/4 billion
during April (see chart on page 111-7). Commercial banks reportedly have
marketed MMCs more aggressively since the mid-March elimination of the 1/4
percentage point rate advantage for MMCs at nonbank thrift institutions. MC
growth at the thrifts moderated in April, and for the first time the dollar
increase at S&Ls was smaller than at commercial banks. While seasonal influ-
ences are unclear, it thus far appears that growth of MMCs at banks and thrifts
combined has not been reduced significantly by the new regulation eliminating
interest compounding on all new issues of MMCs the April increase in total
MMCs was close to the volume in March. Moreover, the growth of money-market
mutual funds and the volume of noncompetitive tenders at April Treasury
bill auctions does not suggest a pronounced shift in investor preferences
away from MMCs.
1/ These estimates should be treated as only suggestive, for three reasons.
First, the reliability of the Demand Deposit Ownership Survey has never been
tested because no independent ownership data exist. Second, the survey sample
size was reduced by over 25 per cent beginning with the March survey. Third,
cash items in process of collection and Federal Reserve float declined sub-
stantially over the period, thereby reducing growth of gross demand deposits.

Growth of total deposits at thrift institutions receded in April
from the already reduced first quarter pace, and M-3 expanded at an annual
rate of about 11 per cent. The slowdown in thrift deposit flows reflected
the reduced growth of MMCs and continued outflows from fixed-ceiling accounts.
On a month-end basis, combined deposits at S&Ls and MSBs expanded at an esti-
mated 2-1/2 per cent annual rate, less than one-third the average pace for
the previous three months and the slowest growth since July 1974.
Commercial banks reduced their reliance on managed liabilities in
April. Large-denomination time deposits declined $6-1/4 billion, while the
rise in nondeposit funds moderated to $3-1/2 billion--although the gross
borrowings from own foreign branches component increased by $1-1/2 billion,
as in March. Banks also reduced gross claims on foreign branches by $1
billion, extending the first quarter decline. (See the Appendix for a dis-
cussion of domestic bank transactions with their foreign branches thus far
in 1979.)
Commercial bank loans and investments expanded at a 13-1/2 per
cent annual rate in April, up sharply from March and above the average pace
during the past year. Holdings of Treasury securities rose markedly in April,
after declining in March, but banks added little to their portfolios of other
securities. Total bank loans expanded at a 15-1/2 per cent rate in April,
with business loans increasing sharply, especially at large New York City
banks. Growth of real estate loans picked up slightly but remained well
below the 1978 pace. At large banks, the increase in consumer loans was
greater than seasonal.
Business Finance
Growth of bank business loans and commercial paper issued by non-
financial firms in April exceeded the brisk first quarter pace. In light of

continued high nominal corporate profits and large Treasury tax receipts,
some of the increase in such borrowing may have been tax-related.
Data for large banks indicate that in April, as in previous months
this year, strength in business loan demand was widespread by industry. Non-
financial commercial paper increased by a record $1.6 billion in April, as
some industrial firms and telephone utilities floated large amounts of paper
and several firms entered the market for the first time. Business credit at
finance companies grew by $2.4 billion during the first quarter, an expansion
of nearly 15 per cent (SAAR). Wholesale automotive paper accounted for two-
thirds of this increase, reflecting a rise in inventories at auto dealers.
Gross public issuance of corporate bonds climbed to $2.9 billion
in April, the largest monthly total since June 1976. Although bond offerings
by nonfinancial corporations increased somewhat due to an enlarged slate of
public utility issues, most of the April increase was attributable to a rise
in intermediate- and long-term bond offerings by financial corporations.
Finance companies issued more than $500 million of notes and bonds, reflect-
ing continued growth in consumer and business lending by these institutions.
In addition, bank holding companies marketed more than $1 billion of floating-
rate notes.
Corporate bond yields have risen significantly over the past month,
reaching new cyclical highs. Increased inflationary expectations may have
affected bond prices generally, and utility bonds have been somewhat weaker
than other issues owing to investor reaction to the nuclear accident at Three
1/
Mile Island in late March. This has contributed to a widening of the spread
1/ Nuclear facilities currently account for nearly 15 per cent of the
electrical generating capacity of the investor-owned utility industry, and many
public utilities are constructing or are planning to build nuclear power plants.

between high-grade utility and Treasury bond yields since early April (see
chart on page 111-13). Moreover, the spread between A- and Aaa-rated utility
bonds has increased significantly, possibly reflecting investor concerns about
the greater vulnerability of lower-rated firms to higher costs likely to be
associated with tighter regulation of nuclear power generating facilities.
Stock offerings rebounded in April, led by public utilities, and
slightly exceeded the pace recorded in the first quarter. Stock prices of
NYSE-listed industrial corporations generally have declined about 3 to 4 per
cent since the April FOMC meeting, although composite indexes of AMEX-listed
and NASDAQ-traded issues remain quite close to record levels. Major stock
price indexes of public utilities have declined about 3-1/2 percent since
the April FOMC meeting. Moreover, Standard and Poor's index of 22 electric
utilities has dropped by 7 per cent since the nuclear mishap in late March.
Municipal Securities
Gross offerings of tax-exempt bonds totaled $3.4 billion (seasonally
adjusted) in April, less than in March but a bit above the monthly average
for the first quarter of the year. The decline from March largely reflected
a reduced volume of issues of mortgage-revenue bonds by State housing finance
agencies. Bonds issued by localities under home mortgage programs amounted
to about $750 million, close to March's record volume.
Nearly all the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds sold this year have
represented new capital, and a relatively large share has been used to sup-
port residential mortgage financing. Legislation recently introduced in the
Congress, however, would prohibit Federal tax exemption of interest on most
State and local government bonds issued after April 24 to provide subsidized
home mortgage credit. As a result, the May calendar of offerings has been
trimmed substantially.

Movements in municipal bond yields have been mixed since March.
Average yields on general obligation issues, as measured by the Bond Buyer
index, have remained virtually unchanged. However, yields on tax-exempt
bonds issued by publicly-owned utilities that operate or depend upon nuclear
facilities have been subject to upward pressure. On the other hand, the
cessation of new offerings of mortgage-revenue bonds has enhanced the attrac-
tiveness of outstanding issues, and their yields have fallen by about 25
basis points.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Securities Markets
The Treasury has paid down $14 billion of maturing cash management
bills since the last FOMC meeting, and has run off a total of $1 billion of
3- and 6-month bills at its regularly scheduled weekly auctions. Meanwhile,
the Treasury raised $5 billion of new cash in coupon issues, including $2.5
billion at the May mid-quarter financing. The May refunding package included
$2.25 billion of 10-year notes and $2 billion of 30-year bonds.
The Treasury cash balance burgeoned, as usual; following the mid-
April tax date. Nevertheless, marketable borrowing (other than cash management
bills) has remained substantial in order to offset a large decline in nonmarket-
able debt--$5.8 billion so far in the second quarter. About $2.6 billion of
this decline is attributable to redemption of the special certificate issued to
the Federal Reserve at the end of March when Treasury borrowing was temporarily
constrained by the debt ceiling. In addition, foreign official institutions
have run down their holdings of nonmarketables, and sales of savings bonds
have been weak. The Treasury recently raised the yield on Series E and H
savings bonds to 6-1/2 per cent, effective June 1, in an attempt to stimulate
sales of such securities.

Treasury bill yields have changed little, on balance, since mid-
April despite substantial sales of these securities by foreigners; foreign
holdings of Treasury bills have dropped by $4 billion since then, bringing
the cumulative decline for this year to $13-1/2 billion. Such sales have
contributed to a significant narrowing of the abnormally wide spread between
Treasury bill and short-term private market rates that had prevailed late
last year.
Federally-sponsored credit agencies raised an estimated $2.4 billion
(seasonally adjusted) in April, about the same as the monthly average for the
first quarter and above last year's record rate. FNMA used about half of its
$1.2 billion borrowing to increase its liquid assets in anticipation of large
deliveries of mortgages under outstanding purchase commitments. The FHLB
System, on the other hand, ran off about $100 million in notes during April
while drawing down its liquidity to finance a large volume of advances to
S&Ls. The Farm Credit System borrowed about $1.3 billion in April, compared
with a monthly average of $931 million in the first quarter.
Mortgage Markets
Total mortgage debt formation in the first quarter was more than a
tenth below the cyclical peak reached late last year. Mortgage borrowing by
both households and businesses declined significantly. Net mortgage lending
by S&Ls and commercial banks was off by about a fifth; and some other major
components, including issues of GNMA-guaranteed securities, declined signifi-
cantly. Net mortgage purchases by FNMA picked up somewhat, but direct market
support provided by GNMA remained modest. The volume of low-rate residential
mortgage credit associated with tax-exempt bond issues of State and local
governments increased markedly in the first quarter, substituting to some
degree for mortgage investment by private institutions.

Mortgage lending by depositary institutions apparently continued
relatively weak in April. The net increase in mortgage loans at commercial
banks rose somewhat from the first quarter pace, but was still well below
the peak rates recorded last year. At S&Ls, commitments outstanding to
acquire mortgages declined to $31.4 billion at the end of March (latest
data available), down 8 per cent from the recent high in November. S&Ls
increased their reliance on high-cost FHLB advances to meet mortgage commit-
ments outstanding as deposit flows slowed in April, and it is unlikely that
S&L commitment activity recovered much, if at all, last month--although loan
volume may have picked up somewhat from the weather-affected first quarter
rate. In early April, the proportion of major mortgage lending institutions
offering commitments for conventional home loans continued well below year-
earlier levels, especially for contracts with relatively high loan/value
ratios.
Average interest rates on new commitments for 80-per cent 30-year
conventional home loans at sampled S&Ls have risen by 20 basis points since
the last FOMC meeting to a record 10.68 per cent, and average rates have
reached 11-1/8 per cent in the western part of the country. About three-
fourths of the S&Ls in the national sample reported supplies of mortgage
funds below normal seasonal patterns in early May, and more than a fourth
considered funds to be in substantially short supply. In secondary markets,
mortgage yields have risen 25 to 35 basis points since mid-April, with the
largest increases recorded in the FNMA forward-commitment auctions. Bidding
in the recent auctions has reflected heightened uncertainty about future
rate movements, and the proportion of bids accepted by FNMA has declined.
FNMA has come under some financial pressure in the last two quarters as its
marginal cost of funds has exceeded its marginal portfolio yield.

Eight States have adjusted or eliminated interest rate ceilings
on home mortgages since the beginning of the year, but in early May nine
States still had ceilings fixed at 10 per cent or less for conventional
home loans, and two States and the District of Columbia had ceilings of 11
per cent. On FHA/VA home loans, which generally are exempt from State usury
limits, the ceiling rate was raised by the Administration to a record 10 per
cent on April 23. Even so, private investors required nearly 5 discount
points on newly originated loans in mid-May as market conditions tightened
further.
Consumer Credit.
Growth in consumer installment credit outstanding slowed signifi-
cantly during the first quarter, despite some rise in the rate of expansion
in March. As disposable income moved up further, the burden of consumer
debt--as measured by the ratio of installment credit liquidations to disposable
personal income--edged down in the first quarter. Moreover, measures of
adverse loan repayment experience--delinquency rates and personal bankrupt-
cies--either remained essentially stable or improved moderately from previous
levels.
Typical finance rates on most types of consumer installment credit--
normally quite steady--have moved up noticeably during the past year. In
almost a dozen States, liberalization of statutory rate ceilings has permitted
1/
increases in some consumer loan rates. By February (latest available
data), finance rates on closed-end installment credit at commercial banks
were up 45 to 75 basis points from year-earlier levels, while rate increases

mortgage-secured consumer lending are subject to the ceiling for second
mortgages rather than the higher limit for consumer loans. As a result,
finance companies in Maryland have curtailed such lending.

at finance companies have ranged as high as 60 basis points. Moreover,
some non-price terms on automobile installment credit have continued to
tighten at commercial banks and finance companies, and press and trade
reports suggest that credit standards have become somewhat more stringent
at certain types of lenders.

Bank Reliance on Foreign Sources of Nondeposit
Funds During Early 1979*
Thus far in 1979 large domestic commercial banks have allowed large
time deposits to run off and have increased their reliance on nondeposit
funds, particularly funds from abroad, to finance the growth of bank credit.
During the first 4 months of this year, domestic commercial banks tapped
sources other than their own foreign branches for about $6-1/2 billion in
nondeposit funds.1 This amount includes about $1 billion in borrowing from
foreign offices of unrelated foreign banks and other foreign entities, as
well as $1 billion of Federal funds purchased from U.S. agencies of foreign
banks who themselves raised substantial fwnds abroad. The remainder of the
$10-1/2 billion increase in nondeposit sources of funds consisted of nearly

$4 billion of gross borrowing from own foreign branches. Over the same
period, banks acquired an additional $5 billion--not included in the non-
deposit sources measure--by liquidating claims on their foreign branches.
Meanwhile, domestic banks allowed $2-1/2 billion of large time deposits
to run off on balance since December, reflecting the sharp declines in
March and April.
Although there appears to have been a shift by banks from domestic
to foreign sources, a substantial portion of the funds obtained by domestic
banks from abroad may have originated in the United States. On an end of
month basis, U.S. nonbank residents added over $5 billion to their deposits
at foreign branches of domestic banks in the first quarter.1 In addition,
money market mutual funds invested nearly $1 billion in Eurodollar CDs
over the first quarter, and U.S. residents increased their deposit hold-
ings at Canadian banks by $1-1/2 billion during the first two months of the
year. Finally, there exists an unreported volume of sales of Eurodollar CDs
to U.S. residents sold through U.S. and foreign brokers located abroad.
Early in 1970, outstanding net Eurodollar borrowings by member banks
from their own foreign branches stood at nearly $15 billion. (see chart on
page III-A-5.) Unlike large time deposits, Eurodollar borrowings have never
been subject to rate ceilings and in the late 1960's, as market rates rose
above large time deposit ceilings, Eurodollars were substituted for these
liabilities. The removal of Regulation Q rate ceilings from large time
1/ An unknown quantity of these deposits represents holdings at Caribbean
branches by U.S. corporations of interest-bearing overnight deposits
that are eligible for transfer in immediately available funds via demand
deposit accounts at domestic banks. The staff recently became aware of
such facilities and has proposed a survey of some banks with Caribbean
branches having deposits of U.S. residents to determine the extent of
such accounts and the dollar amounts involved.

III-A-3
deposits maturing in less than 90 days in June 1970, combined with the
Board's implementation of a marginal reserve requirement on Eurodollar bor-
rowing in 1969, resulted in a sharp decline in Eurodollar borrowings in
1970-1971 and a concomitant increase in issuance of large time deposits.
On balance, over the next 7 years, banks moved into a large net claims
position vis-a-vis foreign branches (i.e., were net advancers of funds
to their own foreign branches) while increasing their reliance on large
time deposits--all maturities of which became free of Regulation Q ceilings
in May 1973--and on domestic nondeposit sources. In early 1979, however,
Eurodollar borrowing and other nondeposit funds have been substituted for
domestic large time deposits.
These recent changes in the composition of commercial bank funding
can be related to the interaction between investor/depositor preferences for
high yield and bank preferences for low-cost funds. As the outlook for the
dollar improved in early 1979, private investors became more willing to hold
dollar-denominated assets. Owing to the segmentation of the Eurodollar and
domestic dollar markets (associated with the customary preference of foreign
residents to deal with Eurobanks), this tended to narrow the spread of Euro-
dollar yields over domestic yields. Combined with the 2 per cent supplemental
reserve requirement on domestic CDs implemented in November and the reduction
to zero of Eurodollar reserve requirements last August, these rate movements
reduced member banks' cost of Eurodollar funding relative to domestic CDs.
These banks, therefore, became more willing to accommodate U.S. residents'
demand for higher yielding Eurodollar deposits.

-4-
Banks took advantage of changing yield differentials in another way
as well in January. As at various times in 1978, in January 1979, the
foreign branches of some major banks apparently issued deposits to nonbank
members of their holding companies as a means of receiving proceeds of com-
mercial paper issued by their domestic nonbank affiliates. At that time
commercial paper offered domestic investors a premium over domestic CDs,
and for banks this was a less expensive alternative to paying Eurodollar
yields to finance foreign branches. (Such transactions are not subject to
the reserve requirement that applies when the proceeds of holding company
commercial paper are channeled directly to domestic branches of member banks.)
Later in the first quarter, however, affiliates' sales of commercial paper
slackened although large banks continued to finance their domestic asset
growth with funds routed through their foreign branches.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. The dollar has continued in generally
strong demand on exchange markets in the five-week period since the last
greenbook. As shown in the chart, the average exchange value of the dollar
increased by a further 1 per cent over this period,
U.S. intervention operations resulted in sales of about $1 billion.
The sustained strength of the dollar has been aided by the announcement of
a reduced U.S. trade deficit in March, as well as further indications of
an acceleration of inflation rates abroad.
Developments involving the Japanese yen have been the focus of
attention on exchange markets in the recent period. In late April the yen
extended its decline against the dollar. Selling pressure on the yen continued
to be generated by market recognition of Japan's heavy dependence on energy
imports at a time of rising energy prices, further indications of a greater-
than-anticipated reduction in Japan's current account surplus, and rising
Japanese prices. After reaching a low of 226 yen per dollar in early May,
the yen reversed direction and started to rise sharply after publication
of various statements by Japanese officials and others that the Japanese
government, with U.S. support, intended to stabilize the yen at a substantially
higher level. A subsequent series of press reports that Japanese authorities
had adopted a target range for the yen around 200 to 210 yen per dollar alter-
nated with official denials of any change in Japanese intervention policy,
causing sharp fluctuations in the yen's exchange rate. By mid-May, the yen

had risen about 6 per cent from its low point earlier in the month. As a
net result of these movements the yen remains about unchanged against the
dollar compared with its value of five weeks ago.
.In a further effort to boost the yen, Japanese
authorities also announced a relaxation of restrictions on capital inflows.
In contrast with the yen, European currencies have fluctuated in
a narrow range against the dollar in the period since the last greenbook.
The mark and related European currencies depreciated by less than 1 per cent
against the dollar.
.The Belgian franc came under moderate
downward pressure within the European Monetary System and Belgian authorities
responded by raising their discount rate from 6 per cent to 7 per cent
The pound and Canadian dollar have also weakened against the dollar
over the past five weeks, depreciating by 2 per cent and 1 per cent respec-
tively,
.Data indicating an acceleration of British inflation into the double-
digit range contributed to the downward pressure on the pound.
U.S. intervention activity over the past five weeks consisted entirely
of purchases of German marks. Desk purchases of nearly $600 million equivalent
of marks in the last two weeks of April enabled the System to repay all of
its outstanding swap debt, and left the System with net realized losses of

IV -4
$10 million on swap drawings and repayments since October 1977. Desk pur-
chases of marks totaling nearly $300 million equivalent so far in May have
been added to Treasury balances.

IV-5
U.S. International Transactions. In the first quarter of this
year the merchandise trade deficit was roughly $25 billion at an annual
rate (international accounts basis), slightly less than the fourth-quarter
deficit. Large intervention sales of dollars reduced foreign official
reserve assets in the United States by $8.1 billion during the first
quarter and an estimated additional 10 billion during the first six weeks
of the second quarter, which more than liquidated the build-up of reserves
that resulted from intervention to support the dollar during the final
three months of 1978.
Total merchandise exports during the first quarter exceeded their
fourth-quarter level by almost 5 per cent in value and about 3 per cent
in volume, as the continuing strong growth of nonagricultural exports --
reflecting a continuing response to the large depreciation of the dollar
during 1977-78 -- far outweighed a decline in agricultural shipments.
The expansion of nonagricultural exports was widespread. The value of
capital goods exports increased by 8 per cent, first quarter over fourth
quarter, with half of the increase accounted for by the growth of civilian
aircraft shipments. Exports of industrial supplies increased by 15 per
cent, half accounted for by increased exports of nonmonetary gold (associated
with the increase in Treasury gold sales) and one-third accounted for by
increased chemical shipments. The decline in agricultural exports -- 3 per
cent in value and nearly 8 per cent in volume, first quarter over fourth
quarter -- was partly due to weather interruptions and partly the expected
result of much-improved harvests in the Southern Hemisphere.

Imports of petroleum increased by nearly 8 per cent in value
during the first quarter, with volume increasing to 9.2 million barrels
per day (mbd), about 5 per cent higher than both the fourth-quarter and
annual averages for last year. A sharp drop in imports from Iran was
more than offset by increased deliveries from other sources. The average
price of imported oil during the first quarter was $13.96 per barrel,
4-1/2 per cent higher than during the fourth quarter; and in March the
average price reached $14.56 per barrel.
Iranian oil production, which started to pick up in March, now
appears to have leveled off at around 4 mbd. Iranian exports are
expected to run about 3.3 mbd, compared with a pre-revolution level of
more than 5 mbd. Several countries, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
have cut back production in the wake of the increase in Iranian output.
Spot prices of petroleum products, which had declined in March, have since
been moving upward.
Gasoline imports averaged about .05 mbd in the first quarter,
less thanone per cent of U.S. consumption. The unit value of imported
gasoline increased by 30 per cent between January and March, reflecting
a substantial increase in world spot-market prices. Gasoline import
volumes have been up to three times as high in tne past. An increase
to previous peak levels in the next few months, to relieve some of the
pressure on U.S. stocks, would add about $1 to $1-1/2 billion (annual rate)
to the U.S. import bill.

Intervention sales of $13 billion from January through the second
week of May more than liquidated the large fourth-quarter increase in
foreign official reserve holdings in the United States. The first-
quarter decline involved foreign official sales of $8.3 billion worth of
short-dated U.S. Treasury securities, with the large volume of these sales
exerting upward pressure on Treasury-bill interest rates relative to
private short-term rates.
U.S. banks reported a net private capital inflow of $13.6 billion
during the first quarter. Not netted against this figure is a $6-1/2 to
7-1/2 billion outflow of funds that U.S. residents (other than banks)
deposited in Eurobanks -- predominantly in foreign branches of U.S. banks.
The outflow into Eurodollar deposits may have been encouraged by last
November's two per cent increase in the reserve requirement on time deposits
held at domestic offices of member banks, which reduced yields on reservable
domestic deposits relative to yields on reserve-free Eurodeposits.
Available data on recorded transactions leave an unexplained
residual inflow of $3.7 billion in the first quarter, much of which may
have been accounted for by the corporate sector both through direct
borrowings and through transactions involving inter-company accounts.
In contrast, the unexplained fourth-quarter residual was a $4 billion
net outflow, much of which may reflect corporate outflows to foreign
firms (including own foreign affiliates) and foreign credit markets. The
reversal in the direction of these flows can be attributed to increased
confidence in the dollar.

Foreign Economic Developments. Inflationary pressures in most
major industrial countries continue to be strong. Whereas increases in
consumer prices recorded earlier in the year derived primarily from sea-
sonal factors, it appears now that the pass-through of previous increases
in wholesale prices from non-seasonal factors has become a more important
force in consumer price inflation. Although recently announced oil price
increases have not yet been fully reflected in wholesale prices in most
countries, external factors, including higher prices for imported oil and
commodities as well as the dollar's strength, have continued to drive
wholesale prices upward at rapid rates. There are also signs in Germany
and Japan that pressure from domestic demand has started to make a stronger
contribution to inflation.
In Japan, the authorities have responded to the prospect of
accelerating inflation and a sharp depreciation of the yen with a 3/4
point increase in the discount rate, the first increase in more than five
years. In Germany, both the discount rate and lombard rate were raised
by a percentage point at the end of March, and interest rates in Canada
have been kept high even though the growth rate of the Canadian money
stock is well below its target level. Indications of tighter monetary
policy have also become evident in Switzerland.
The level of activity in most major industrial countries has
not changed significantly in the past month. There are signs, however,
of prospective strength in investment in Japan and Germany, while exports
have continued to be an important source of growth in Italy. Labor market
conditions also have improved somewhat in Canada, Germany, Japan, and the
United Kingdom.

The Japanese current-account surplus has continued to decline at
a rapid rate. Even abstracting from the government's program of emergency
imports, the first quarter current-account surplus was less than $6 billion
(s.a.a.r.), as compared with a $18-1/2 billion surplus in 1978 (again, not
including emergency imports). The German first-quarter current-account
surplus of $1.5 billion, however, was only $100 million below its level of
a year ago.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, previous sharp increases in
wholesale prices are now being passed on to consumers. In March the CPI
rose by 1.0 per cent, and in April it jumped by 1.2 per cent. Upward
pressure on wholesale prices also continues to be strong as indicated by
the 1.7 per cent rise in April. About two-thirds of recent increases in
the WPI can be traced to external factors including higher prices for
imported commodities, increased oil prices, and the yen's depreciation,
but domestic factors have started to play a stronger role lately. The
outlook for moderation of further inflationary pressure from domestic
sources now appears somewhat more favorable, however, in view of expected
wage increases in FY1979 of only about 6 per cent and recent steps taken
to slow the expansion of the domestic economy. On April 17 the Bank of
Japan raised the official discount rate from 3.5 to 4.25 per cent for the
first time in over five years. The authorities also indicated that they
would adjust their planned front-loading of fiscal expenditure to a more
even phasing during the current fiscal year.
The recovery of activity appears to have continued strongly in
the first quarter. Industrial production (s.a.) rose at an annual rate of
more than 8 per cent, despite a slight decline in the index in March, and

IV -16
the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in almost two years.
Erosion of the current-account surplus is still progressing at
a rapid pace. The first deficit in the seasonally-adjusted current-
account since November 1976 was recorded in March; for the quarter as a
whole, the current-account surplus was less than $1-1/2 billion at an
annual rate (about $5-3/4 billion excluding emergency imports). Increases
in both dollar import prices and import volume were important factors in
the lower first-quarter figures. Prospects for maintaining the surplus
at about the first-quarter level in 1979 appear quite good, especially
in view of Prime Minister Ohira's commitment to a reduction of the surplus,
announced after discussions with President Carter earlier this month.
The German economy continues to show signs of strengthening
activity. Unemployment was down to 3.9 per cent (s.a.) in March and
3.8 per cent in April from an average 1978 rate of 4.4 per cent, and
business climate indicators, capacity utilization, and investment inten-
tion surveys all point toward stronger activity. Inflation, as measured
by all major price indices, has picked up considerably compared to the
low rates of 1978. The CPI during the first four months of 1979 rose at
an annual rate of nearly 8-1/2 per cent. Among the major factors in this
development was the 21 per cent (a.r.) rise in import prices during the
first quarter of 1979. The effect of higher oil prices alone on the
year-over-year change in the CPI has been estimated at 0.5 to 0.7 percent-
age points. While some German inflation may be due to external factors,
such as the recent strength of the dollar, there are signs that the recovery
of domestic demand is also generating price pressures, as seen, for example,
in the construction industry. The spring round of wage negotiations has

IV -17
produced settlements in the 4 to 5 per cent range; after taking into
account this year's planned tax cuts, net wages are expected to increase
by about 6 per cent in 1979.
Germany's current-account surplus (n.s.a.) recorded a $1.5
billion surplus for the first quarter, compared to a $5.5 billion sur-
plus for the fourth quarter of 1978. This decline, however, was largely
due to seasonal factors; the year-ago figure was a $1.6 billion surplus.
In the United Kingdom, industrial production (s.a.) in February
recovered sharply from its strike-depressed January level and was at a
level slightly above that prevailing in the fourth quarter of 1978.
Preliminary data indicate that real personal consumption expenditures
rose some 2-1/2 per cent (s.a.a.r.) between the final quarter of last
year and the first quarter of this year. A labor dispute involving civil
servants has delayed publication of British foreign-trade statistics and
therefore the U.K.'s recent external performance cannot be assessed.
In the Parliamentary election held on May 3, the Conservatives
won an overall majority of 43 seats. The new government's budget for the
fiscal year which began last month is scheduled to be announced on June 12.
During the course of their government, the Conservatives are expected to
attempt some labor-market reforms, reduce government intervention in
industry, liberalize exchange controls, reduce government spending and
taxes as a proportion of GDP, and switch some taxation from direct to
indirect taxes.
Inflation accelerated rather sharply in the United Kingdom in
the first quarter of 1979, with consumer prices rising some 13 per cent
(a.r.) over the previous quarter, as compared with 7 per cent (a.r.) bet-
ween the third and fourth quarter of 1978. Excluding seasonal foods, these

IV -18
figures are 10-3/4 and 7-1/4 per cent, respectively. Similarly, wholesale-
price inflation has accelerated in recent months, reflecting in part move-
ments in world commodity and raw material prices. The strength of sterling
on foreign-exchange markets has helped to restrain the rate of price in-
creases in recent months. Wage increases, after accelerating in 1978, may
be leveling off at an annual rate of 14-15 per cent.
Economic conditions in France remain on an uncertain trend as
regards industrial output, and price increases still show no signs of
decelerating. Industrial production fell by 1.8 per cent in February,
but recovered again to the January level in March, with average output
in the first quarter 4.2 per cent higher than a year earlier. The unem-
ployment rate in March rose to an estimated 6.1 per cent, and most obser-
vers anticipate further gradual increases ahead. Preliminary national
accounts data indicate that French GDP rose 3.3 per cent in 1978, with
private consumption the strongest component (4 per cent gain) and fixed
investment making a rather weak contribution to growth (0.7 per cent).
Data for the first quarter, during which France had a seasonally-adjusted
trade surplus of about $290 million, suggest continued strength in the
external accounts, although the impact of higher oil and commodities
prices has not yet been fully absorbed.
Recent price data call into doubt the government's goal for a
deceleration of inflation this year. Wholesale prices for industrial
goods rose faster, month by month, in the January to March period than at
any time during 1978, and in March the index stood almost 13 per cent
above its year-earlier level. Wholesale prices already show the influ-
ence of oil-price hikes, and increases in dollar prices of other commodities

IV -19
suggest further pressure on consumer prices ahead. The acceleration of
consumer prices to date has been less pronounced, but retail prices in
the first quarter were over 10 per cent above year-earlier levels. The
March increase of 0.9 per cent was fairly uniformly spread across major
categories of CPI components -- food, manufactures and services.
Industrial production in Canada rose by 0.7 per cent in February
to a level 8.3 per cent above that of a year earlier. Mining, utilities
and manufacturing all recorded increases output during February. The
employment situation also improved noticeably in the first quarter.
Employment increased at an annual rate of 5.2 per cent, and as a conse-
quence the unemployment rate dropped from 8.1 per cent at the end of 1978
to 7.9 per cent for March.
The all-items consumer price index for Canada increased by 1.2
per cent in March. As a result, the twelve-month rise between March 1978
and March 1979 was 9.2 per cent, unchanged from year-to-year increases
observed in recent months. Higher food prices were once again a signifi-
cant factor, having been responsible for about one-half of the increase.
Food prices advanced by 2.5 per cent between February and March (17.4 per
cent above March 1978 level), unchanged from the increase observed in the
previous month. Seasonally adjusted figures show M1 rising at an annual
rate of 4.5 per cent from the June 1978 base, which is well below the
target range of 6-10 per cent. Despite a rate of money-stock growth below
target levels and recent strengthening of the Canadian dollar, the Bank
of Canada has maintained its high interest rate policy. Federal elections
will be held in Canada on May 22 with Prime Minister Trudeau facing Conser-
vative opposition leader Joe Clark.

IV -20
The high rate of inflation in Italy is continuing according to
the most recent data. Wholesale prices, which rose over 5 per cent bet-
ween December and March, have reflected oil and commodity price increases.
Rent increases have had a major impact on consumer prices in January and
April, the months in which quarterly adjustments are made. Further infla-
tionary pressure is expected to arise from wage-escalator increases in May,
as the cost-of-living index (for February-April) used for calculating these
increases rose nearly 5 per cent over the previous three-month period. The
major labor negotiations are continuing at a deliberate pace. Exports have
been a major source of the continued strength of economic activity. The
trade account so far this year on a customs basis has been in surplus,
despite import increases outstripping the pace of recovery, presumably
due to re-stocking.
The Scandinavian economies provide exceptions to the general
inflationary trend among the industrial countries. First-quarter in-
creases in consumer prices in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark were all signi-
ficantly below year-ago levels, due in part to price control programs in
all three countries. In Switzerland, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) moved
to a tighter monetary policy in the first 4 months of 1979 in response to
increased inflation and the stabilization of the Swiss franc. M1 fell
slightly in both January and February, and clearing accounts of banks,
trade, and industry with the SNB fell in April to their lowest level in
six months.
