The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
There is evidence that economic activity weakened further in the
second quarter, reflecting in part the repercussions of continued large
increases in prices, particularly for energy, and the effects of gasoline
shortages. Employment growth has slowed in recent months, and industrial
production was only at its March level despite a rebound in May. The
softening of demand has been concentrated in the consumer sector as retail
sales in real terms have fallen substantially since the end of last year.
In the investment area, real capital spending appears to have dropped
somewhat in the second quarter and housing starts remained below late 1978
levels. Energy prices have continued to accelerate, swamping the effects
of a moderation in food prices.
Prices and Domestic Energy Developments
Recent price movements continue to be marked by developments in
the energy sector as prices for petroleum products have soared. At the
same time, price increases for food products at the retail level have
slowed somewhat; they were a principal factor in the acceleration of in-
flation earlier in the year. Over the first five months of this year,
consumer prices and producer prices of finished goods have risen at annual
rates of about 13-1/2 and 11-1/2 percent, respectively--a pace not seen
since 1974.
The most intense inflationary pressures are concentrated in the
energy sector where price increases have accelerated even further from the

rapid rates earlier in the year. At retail, fuel oil and gasoline prices
increased at 50 and 70 percent annual rates, respectively, from March
to May--the largest rises since the record climb of early 1974. Further-
more, cost pressures are likely to remain intense in the energy sector
as a result of the June 28 OPEC decisions to raise crude oil prices.
Although the increase will vary among producers, the new average OPEC
contract sales price may be about 25 percent above the second quarter level.
The gasoline situation in recent months has been characterized
by sharply rising prices and supply shortages. These price increases
reflect the pass-through of higher crude oil costs as well as market
forces and new Department of Energy regulations permitting a large increase
in margins. Gasoline production in the second quarter was somewhat below
the comparable period last year and deliveries at retail may have fallen
more than 5 percent below the year-earlier level. Moreover, under federal
allocation rules, some users have been given priority to available supplies
and, as a result, the reduction in deliveries has been considerably greater
in some localities.
Retail food prices, which rose very rapidly in early 1979,
increased at an 8 percent annual rate in May--this was the slowest rate
of advance in six months. Producer prices of finished foods declined
in April and May and average food prices at the farm level have dropped
somewhat recently. These developments suggest the possibility of near-
term retail food price increases continuing to be more moderate. However,

II -4
the longer term prospects for food prices appear to have been affected
adversely by unfavorable crop conditions in the USSR, which have pushed
U.S. grain prices sharply higher, and by freeze damage to the Brazilian
coffee crop.
Increases in consumer prices of items other than food and
energy accelerated from March to May to about an 11 percent annual rate.
The increase in homeownership costs, reflecting a combination of rising
mortgage interest rates and house prices, has been a major factor in the
acceleration of CPI nonfood, nonenergy items this year. Since December,
these homeownership prices have risen at an annual rate of about 17 per-
cent, well above the 12-1/2 percent rate over 1978. Among other items,
new car prices rose sharply in April and May while apparel nearly leveled
off after the large March increase. Rent increases accelerated markedly
in May following 4 months in which rises were more moderate.
Employment and Production
Growth in demand for labor has slowed appreciably in recent months
as employment at nonfarm establishments rose by 160,000 (strike-adjusted)
in May following a gain of only 60,000 in April; monthly increases in the
preceding six months averaged 340,000. A substantial share of the May
increase was in the service sector. Manufacturing employment fell 30,000
in May after a similar decline in April; the cumulative drop in factory pay-
rolls in these two months was the largest in the past 4 years. Cutbacks
in employment were widespread among producers of both durable and nondurable
goods; the machinery industry was the only manufacturing sector in which

employment in May exceeded its March level. The factory workweek re-
bounded in May to 40.2 hours from the effects of strikes and holidays
in April, but was still somewhat below the first-quarter average.
Total employment, as measured by the household survey, rose
almost 150,000 in May after a large decline in April, and the unemploy-
ment rate was unchanged at 5.8 percent. Jobless rates for most groups
of workers--both experienced and inexperienced--remained close to those
prevailing since mid-1978.
Industrial production is estimated to have risen 1.3 percent in
May, following a drop in April of about the same magnitude. The May level
of the index was only fractionally above that of December, a marked slowing
from the 8 percent annual rate rise over the last half of 1978. By type
of product, the May increase was fairly widespread; an especially large
rebound in consumer goods production reflected a pick-up in auto assemblies
following reductions in April largely caused by the Teamsters' strike.
However, in light of weaker auto sales and rising stocks of large cars,
the industry has already curtailed production of some models and further
reductions in the months ahead may be necessary. Output of business
equipment increased sharply in May, and since the start of the year, gains
in this sector have been at a 5-3/4 percent annual rate. In addition,
materials production rose briskly as many metals and parts industries
resumed normal schedules following the strike-related disruptions of
April.
Reflecting the marked slowing of growth in manufacturing output
so far this year, pressures on industrial capacity have eased somewhat,

In May, the operating rate in manufacturing--at 85.6 percent--was about
1/2 percentage point below the relatively high first quarter figure.
lower rates have been recorded in the primary metals, motor vehicles and
parts, and petroleum and coal products industries. Similarly, utiliza-
tion rates in most materials industries are beginning to show more slack
than during last winter.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Personal income rose at an annual rate of 8-1/2 percent in May
after a much smaller increase in April. The May gain reflected a rebound
in private payrolls following the trucking industry work stoppage and
construction disruptions from flooding in several areas. Income growth
in the first five months of 1979 was at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate, as
compared with a 12-1/2 percent rise during 1978. In real terms, the May
level of personal income was about 1-1/2 percent below that of late last
year.
Reflecting in part the slackening of income growth, household
demands for goods continued to weaken in May. Retail sales declined 0.2
percent from the already low April level, and they have been virtually
flat for the last five months. In real terms, retail sales have fallen
4-3/4 percent from the December peak--the sharpest and longest decline
of such sales since the 1974-1975 recession.
Retail sales excluding autos and mainly nonconsumer items rose
0.6 percent in nominal terms in May, following a fractional increase in
April. Sales at food stores have changed little in recent months after
large increases early this year. Sales of discretionary items--general

merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliances--rebounded in May
following a drop in April.
Total auto sales declined to an 11.0 million unit annual rate
in May, down almost 400,000 units from the April rate and off almost 1-1/4
million units from the near record set in March. Due to the preference
for gas-efficient cars, sales of imports--at a 2.9 million unit rate--were
at an all-time high and sales of the smaller domestic models were also
very strong. Apparently reflecting the same forces, sales of domestic-
type automobiles in the first 20 days of June tumbled to a 7.5 million
annual rate from an 8-1/4 million unit rate in May and over a 9 million
unit rate in the first quarter. The sharpness of the decline in auto
sales apparently reflected heightened uncertainties concerning the avail-
ability and price of gasoline as well as tight supplies of small cars.
The reduced level of real consumer spending has coincided with a
deterioration of attitudes as reported in consumer surveys. In May, the
Conference Board index of consumer confidence--a monthly composite of five
questions on both present and expected economic conditions--declined further
to the lowest level since 1975. Similarly, the Michigan Survey Research
Center index of sentiment remained low in May and was sharply off from
a year earlier. The latter survey also revealed that consumers' expecta-
tions of price inflation were at a record high and that buying conditions
for cars were rated more unfavorable than at any time in the past three
years.

Business Fixed Investment
Investment spending weakened somewhat in the April-May period due
to sluggishness in the equipment area. Shipments of nondefense capital
goods rose only 1 percent in May after a sharp strike-related decline in
April; shipments for the two months were marginally below the first quarter
level. In addition, business purchases of trucks have declined sharply.
However, expenditures on nonresidential construction put-in-place were
very strong in the past 3 months and the April-May average was about 5-3/4
percent above the first quarter level.
Indicators of near-term capital spending commitments, which had
been quite buoyant in the first quarter, have weakened recently. New orders
for nondefense capital goods gained 3 percent in May after falling almost
13 percent in April. The machinery component, more indicative of under-
lying equipment demand, was up only slightly in May following a very large
drop in April. However, despite the reduced level of orders, capital
goods shipments are expected to be relatively well-maintained in the
next few months because of the high level of unfilled orders.
In the construction area, new commitments for commercial and
industrial buildings have fallen in recent months and in May, were 17-1/2
percent below the February peak and only slightly above the monthly
average in the fourth quarter of last year.
The recent weakening in commitments for fixed capital investment
contrasts with the indications of the latest Commerce Department survey of
plant and equipment expenditure plans for 1979. The survey, taken in late

April and May, indicated that businesses plan to boost plant and equip-
ment spending in 1979 to almost 13 percent, an upward revision from the
rise reported in the February survey. It should be noted, however, that
this survey generally has overpredicted spending during previous periods
of contraction in overall activity. The Conference Board survey of capital
appropriations showed a trend similar to the Commerce Department reading,
with a 15 percent increase in manufacturing appropriations in the first
quarter following a comparable gain in the fourth quarter.
Inventory Investment
Inventory investment by manufacturing and trade establishments in
April increased at an annual rate of $68 billion in book value terms,
substantially above the $49 billion rate in the first quarter and the
largest monthly increase on record. Accumulation was especially large at
manufacturing and auto dealers.
In May, the book value of manufacturers' inventories rose at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $28 billion in May, well below the
exceptionally large, strike-related April gain and somewhat below the
first quarter pace. A substantial rebound in shipments occurred in May,
and as a result the ratio of inventory to sales dropped back to about the
relatively low March level. Increases in manufacturers' stocks were
concentrated in the durable goods sector, largely for producers of
nonelectrical machinery and aircraft and parts. Stocks of primary metals

producers declined somewhat, resuming the downward trend evident in the
December-March period. In the nondurable goods sector, most of the increase
was in stocks of producers of food products.
By stage-of-fabrication, manufacturers' inventories of finished
goods increased at only a $4.8 billion annual rate in May, much below
the $16.0 billion rate in April when the Teamsters' strike/lockout and
the steel haulers' strike reduced total shipments sharply. The remaining
accumulation in May was equally divided between materials and supplies
and work-in-process.
Housing
With a small increase in May, private housing starts averaged
a 1.8 million unit annual rate in the first two months of the second quarter.
This was 10 percent above the weather-depressed first quarter rate but
well below the 2.1 million unit rate in the final quarter of 1978. Similar
movements occurred in new residential building permits issued during this
period.
Much of this year's slowdown in new housing activity has been in
the single-family sector. In May, new starts were about 20 percent below
the pace in late 1978; activity in all major regions of the country has
declined from the earlier levels. Sales of new and existing single-
family homes also have fallen significantly since late last year. Since
then the average price of new houses has risen sharply further and in
April this price--at $70,000--was 18 percent above a year earlier.

Activity in the multifamily sector, which is typically quite
volatile, also has slowed from 1978 levels. Starts of new multifamily
units increased almost 40 percent in May, following sharply reduced rates
earlier in the year. Nonetheless, total units started so far in 1979
are 12-1/2 percent below the rate in the final quarter of 1978. In part,
this reflects reductions in HUD-subsidized multifamily starts although
the budgeted level for the entire fiscal year for such starts is generally
in line with last year's rate. In recent months, market conditions for un-
subsidized units apparently have remained quite tight; in fact, vacancy rates
remained at historically low levels through the first quarter and sales of
new condominiums continued brisk through the end of 1978.
Government Sector
The Federal deficit (NIPA basis) in the second quarter is now
estimated to have been around an $11 billion annual rate, $12 billion
smaller than a year earlier. Withheld taxes rose rapidly in April and
May and nonwithheld taxes were quite strong due to large final settlements
on 1978 tax liabilities. Federal nondefense purchases apparently fell in
the second quarter as Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans to
farmers declined by about $2-1/2 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate. (Redemptions of CCC loans are treated as negative outlays in the
national income accounts.)
Recent growth in activity of state and local governments remains
modest. Capital outlays, as measured by the value of construction put-in-
place, increased appreciably in April and May, but in real terms, state
and local construction in May was still about 5 percent below the December

II -21
level. This weaker recovery from winter interruptions is in marked
contrast to last spring when construction rebounded sharply from
weather-depressed levels.
Employment in the state and local sector was virtually unchanged
in May despite some increase in payrolls under CETA funding. Payroll
employment is currently slightly below that of a year ago--an unprecedented
occurrence for the state and local governments during the past quarter century.
Wages
Wage rates for production and nonsupervisory workers
in the private nonfarm sector of the economy--as measured
by the volatile index of average hourly earnings--rose at a moderate 1.6
percent annual rate in May to a level 7.6 percent above that of a year ago.
Over the past year, the index for the manufacturing sector has risen at an
8-1/2 percent rate, slightly faster than the pace of the preceding 12 months.
A similar rate of increase was reported for the trade sector, where the
January minimum wage adjustment had a large impact.
After lengthy strikes, collective bargaining agreements were reached
for machinists at United Airlines and workers in the rubber industry. The
latter contract included a significant increase in the cost-of-living pro-
visions beginning in the second year of the contract; it is estimated that
the new escalator clause will compensate workers fully for future price
rises. According to COWPS, both contracts probably exceed the wage
standards.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Aggregate credit flows to nonfinancial sectors of the economy
apparently picked up slightly in the second quarter. In April and May, busi-
nesses maintained the strong pace of short- and intermediate-term borrowing
evident since year-end, while corporate bond and equity offerings continued
at the moderate level of the first quarter. In June, business borrowing from
large banks appeared to accelerate somewhat, and public bond offerings surged.
In the household sector, growth in both net installment and mortgage borrowing
strengthened in the April-May period from the weather-depressed volume of the
winter, but stayed well below the average rate for 1978. Net borrowing by the
Treasury accelerated in the quarter, while state and local borrowing about
matched that of the first three months of the year.
Growth in the key monetary aggregates accelerated sharply in the
second quarter. Following two quarters of virtually no change, M-1 expanded
at a 7-3/4 percent annual rate last quarter, owing in part to reduced shifting
to ATS accounts and temporary tax-related factors. Boosted by enlarged net
inflows of MMCs and reduced net outflows from savings accounts, growth of the
interest-bearing component of M-2 also picked up from the first-quarter rate,
despite the record runoffs of large time deposits accompanying the move toward
still greater Eurodollar financing. At thrifts--for whom the ceiling rate
advantage on MMCs was lost during most of the quarter--slower growth of MMCs
contributed to a moderate reduction in second-quarter deposit inflows.
With incoming data suggesting a weakening in economic activity and
thus causing market participants to anticipate an easing of monetary policy,
most interest rates have fallen since the May FOMC meeting, even though Federal
funds have continued generally to trade at about 10-1/4 percent. Yields on

Treasury bills have fallen 50 to 100 basis points on balance, while short-term
private yields have declined 20 to 50 basis points. Contributing to this move-
ment has been a decline in the volume of bills outstanding, as well as a swing
to bill purchases by foreign central banks associated with renewed dollar
support operations. Treasury and corporate bond yields have also declined--by
about 40 basis points--but rates on conventional home mortgages have posted a
substantial further increase in the primary market.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
In June, M-1 grew at a 15 percent annual rate. Only a small part of
this surge was due to the earlier than usual disbursement of social security
payments; viewed along with the preceding two months, the June growth suggested
the possibility of some strengthening of the underlying demand for M-1. However
the marked acceleration of M-1 growth in the second quarter also reflected in
part two other influences. First, the diversion of funds from demand deposits
to ATS and New York NOW accounts is estimated to have slowed M-1 growth by
only 1-1/2 percentage points at an annual rate in the second quarter, compared
to 2-3/4 points in the preceding three months .1 Second, Treasury delays in
processing the mid-April tax payments and a bunching of refunds raised quarterly
M-1 growth by an estimated 1-1/2 percentage points.
The interest-bearing component of M-2 also resumed a more rapid rate
of expansion in the second quarter. Indeed, the 13-1/2 percent annual rate
of growth registered in June was the highest since last August, and reflected
the first increase in savings deposits in nine months. For the quarter, a
1/ Discussions with bankers indicate that despite the recent court decision
barring ATS after year-end, banks generally have continued to actively
advertise ATS, and the public has continued to open new accounts
at about the same rate as before the decision.

moderation in outflows from small time deposits other than MMCs, and the
heavier net issuance of MMCs, more than offset a sizable runoff of large time
accounts included in M-2.1
Net issuance of MMCs at commercial banks during the April-May period
increased to $15 billion, a record two-month net inflow. (See table on page
6.) Commercial banks reportedly intensified their marketing efforts following
the elimination in mid-March of the 1/4-point ceiling rate advantage on MMCs
for thrift institutions.2 MMC growth at thrifts slowed markedly in April,
still further in May, and was very small at S&Ls again in the first three weeks
of June. During. April and May, thrifts garnered only 43 percent of net MMC
issues, after acquiring a two-thirds market share through the previous nine
months. For banks and thrifts combined, growth in total MMC balances, not
seasonally adjusted, was somewhat slower in May than in April, perhaps reflect-
ing a lagged effect of the mid-March prohibition of interest compounding on
new issues of the certificates. The average level of noncompetitive tenders
at weekly Treasury bill auctions and the increase in money market mutual fund
net assets remained strong in both months.
Despite the decline in net MMC sales at S&Ls and MSBs, expansion of
total thrift deposits is estimated to have weakened only moderately in the
second quarter, on a quarterly average basis. Thrift deposit expansion was
bolstered in May and early June by increased issuance of large CDs.
1/ Beginning July 1, banks and thrifts were able to offer the new 4-year
variable-ceiling counterpart to the MMC, paying maximum rates of 7.60
and 7.85 percent, respectively, 35 basis points above the fixed ceiling
applicable to 4-year accounts, and 15 basis points below the fixed ceiling
on 8-year accounts. On the same date, a 1/4 point increase in the savings
account ceiling became effective. Press reports indicate that some banks
are taking this opportunity to introduce minimum balance requirements on
savings accounts. Under such plans, accounts not satisfying these require-
ments would be assessed a monthly fee or would earn no interest.
2/ In mid-June, auction yields on six-month Treasury bills fell sufficiently
that a small offering rate differential between commercial banks and thrifts
reappeared.

Commercial banks, in contrast, allowed $19-1/2 billion of large time
deposits to run off in the second quarter, including a decline of about $13
billion at member banks with foreign branches. Partly offsetting this decline,
member banks tapped their foreign branches for $2-1/2 billion in June, and
nearly $10 billion in the quarter--following a $6 billion net inflow in the
first quarter--by both increasing their liabilities to and reducing their
claims on these branches.1 Since year-end, Eurodollar borrowing has been less
costly than issuance of large time deposits by domestic offices, as the 8 per-
cent reserve requirement on domestic CDs has more than offset the market yield
differential between these two instruments. (See chart on page 8.) By May,
member banks had moved to a net liability position with respect to their own
foreign branches for the first time since late 1974.
Commercial banks also increased their reliance on domestic nondeposit
sources, as they had during the first quarter. During April and May, these
nondeposit funds averaged nearly $2 billion higher than during the first quar-
ter--owing entirely to increases in security RPs with the nonbank public; this
pattern appeared to continue in early June. As a result of the substitution
of RPs and Eurodollars--both of which tend to be short term--for a portion of
domestic CDs, short-dated large negotiable CDs have declined as a proportion
of total CDs at domestic offices of large banks.
Total bank credit grew at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate in the April-
May period, moderately below its pace in the first quarter but about equal
to that in 1978. (For large banks indicate relatively stronger growth in early
1/ On an end week of month basis, net borrowing from own foreign branches
totaled about $5-1/2 billion in the second quarter, with essentially no
change in June.

June.) Banks acquired Treasury securities at a substantially faster rate in
April and May than in the first quarter, but such growth apparently slowed--
at least at large banks--in June. Bank loan growth slowed slightly during
the first two months of the quarter, with some diminution in the advance of
all major loan categories except lending to individuals. However, available
data for large banks suggest faster growth in June, especially for real estate,
security and business loans.
Business Credit
The rapid growth of bank loans to businesses in June appears to have
exceeded the accelerated pace of about 20 percent set in both the first quarter
and April-May. In mid-June, the prevailing prime rate dropped to 11-1/2 per-
cent, reflecting the decline in banks' cost of funds and the lower rates on
competing credit sources. Moreover, responses from large banks in May to
the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey of Bank Lending Practices indicated
greater willingness to relax compensating balance requirements.
In addition to the strength in bank loans to businesses, outstanding
ing commercial paper issued by nonfinancial firms surged in April and increased
slightly further in May. Business credit at finance companies increased more
rapidly over the two months--buoyed by auto dealer financing--and brought the
April-May growth of these three types of business credit to just above the
strong first-quarter pace. In contrast, long-term borrowing by nonfinancial
corporations, while somewhat stronger in the second quarter than in the first,
remained moderate. These financing patterns are not unusual when economic
activity levels off (see the chart on page 12 which plots average growth of
debt components over four-quarter intervals). The relative shift to short-
and intermediate-term financing at such times probably reflects in part

that long-term interest rates will fall. In addition, inventories rise,
collection of receivables slows, and profits weaken as sales turn sluggish,
generating a temporary need for funds.
Cyclically rapid expansions in bank business loans, which dominate
movements in short- and intermediate-term business financing, often have been
accompanied by increases in the proportion of term loans to total business
loans at banks. Term loans, predominantly with maturities of 1 to 5 years,
offer corporations an alternative to bond financing while allowing banks to
lock in loan rates perceived to be cyclically high. The share of term business
loans outstanding at large banks in May remained at the record high reached in
the first quarter. Moreover, fixed-rate agreements represented a much higher
than usual proportion of term loans made by commercial banks, according to the
Survey of Terms of Bank Lending taken in early May.
In the long-term area, gross public offerings of corporate bonds
increased in June to $3-3/4 billion, seasonally adjusted, the largest monthly
total in four years and well above the $1-3/4 billion monthly average over the
first five months of the year. Public offerings of bonds by industrial corpora-
tions totaled about $1-1/2 billion last month (NSA), compared to a $400 million
monthly average earlier in the year. The June increase in longer-term debt
financing by industrial corporations reportedly was in response to the decline
in corporate bond yields after the May FOMC meeting. Apparently, corporate
borrowers did not expect this decline in long-term rates to continue--or per-
haps even to be maintained. The bond calendar for July and August is much
lighter than in June; thus, it appears that last month's slate was in part
just a speed-up of planned offerings.
Note and bond issues by financial corporations also contributed to
June's large slate of offerings. Intermediate- and long-term issues by finance

companies, floating-rate note issues by major bank holding companies, and
mortgage-backed bond issues by West Coast S&Ls boosted the second-quarter
total of financial offerings to the largest dollar volume on record. The
slate of public bond offerings by nonfinancial and financial corporations
combined was the largest for any quarter since mid-1977.
Stock price indexes have increased about 2 percent since the last
FOMC meeting, and year-to-date gains are approximately 8 percent. These
increases reflect in large part the substantial upward movement in the share
prices of corporations in the petroleum and natural gas industries. The
stock prices of these companies, as a group, have climbed about 20 percent
this year, with about one-half of the gain occurring since mid-May. The stock
prices of companies outside the petroleum and natural gas industries also have
advanced thus far in 1979, but their overall gain is somewhat less than 5 per-
cent.
Government Debt Markets
Net offerings of marketable obligations by the Treasury in the second
quarter totaled $14-1/2 billion (SA), up from $5 billion in the first quarter.
Since the last FOMC meeting, the Treasury has raised $600 million (NSA) of new
money through the sale of marketable issues. Continuing the pattern evident
throughout the quarter, a further decline in the volume of Treasury bills out-
standing was more than offset by a nearly $4 billion net increase in coupon
issues. Of this latter amount, $1-1/2 billion was obtained through the sale
of 15-year bonds and the remainder by issues of 2-year and 4-year notes.
The federally sponsored credit agencies raised approximately $5
billion (SA) in the second quarter. While still substantial, this volume
was down significantly from the record pace of the preceding quarter and

III-15
reflected a large seasonally adjusted decline in funds raised by the Federal
Home Loan Banks. Their advances to member S&Ls apparently increased about
as much in the second quarter as in the previous quarter, but the FHLBs
relied more heavily on reductions in liquidity and on inflows of deposits
from S&Ls to finance such lending. Similarly, the pace of borrowing by
the Federal Farm Credit Banks was down somewhat from the first quarter, but
remained historically high. FNMA, however, continued to borrow large amounts.
The gross volume of bonds issued by state and local governments in
the second quarter was essentially unchanged from that of the first quarter,
as issues in June rebounded following the May decline. The June advance
reflected an increase in offerings of general obligations as well as in issu-
ance of revenue bonds to finance housing programs. About three-fourths of the
$650 million in housing bonds issued during June were to finance single-family
mortgages. (See table on p. 17.) The reduced issuance of these bonds in May
resulted from the introduction of legislation to ban them. More recently,
however, Congress has seemed inclined to limit rather than prohibit the issu-
ance of single-family mortgage revenue bonds, and recent issues have been sold
contingent on favorable legislative action.
Despite the heavy offerings of general obligations, the average yield
on these bonds--as measured by the Bond Buyer Index--has fallen 18 basis points
since mid-May to its current level of 6.12 percent June 29. The ratio of tax-
exempt to corporate bond yields fell to a record low in June. This ratio has
been trending downward since late 1977, apparently due to the continued demands
for tax-exempt bonds by commercial banks, property/liability insurance companies,
and the growing number of individuals pushed by inflation into higher tax bracket

Mortgage and Consumer Credit
Although the pace of mortgage lending by commercial banks in May
was about unchanged from the previous month, lending by S&Ls picked up further,
particularly by those in the West. As S&Ls' new commitments were less than
their takedowns during May, outstanding mortgage commitments at these institu-
tions declined for the fifth time in six months, reaching $31-1/4 billion,
nearly $3 billion below the peak last November. Meanwhile, issuance of GNMA
pass-through securities increased somewhat in May.
Average interest rates on new commitments for 80 percent 30-year
mortgages at sampled S&Ls have climbed more than 35 basis points since the
May FOMC meeting, attaining a new high of 11.10 percent. All major regions
have contributed to the increase, with the largest advances registered in the
Midwest and the West.1 Field reports suggest that the additional mortgage
rate increases in the primary market last month reflected relatively heavy
credit demands at a time of S&L uncertainty about the volume and cost of
future cash flows. With the recent weakness in MMC flows at thrifts and with
only moderate inflows of deposits subject to fixed rate ceilings S&Ls relied
on other sources to meet their increased mortgage commitments. These sources
included issuance of large CDs, reduction of liquid assets, and to a lesser
extent, issuance of commercial paper and mortgage-backed bonds. On the other
hand, growth of S&L borrowing from Federal Home Loan Banks in May was well
below the very high April increase. Moreover, in late May the FHLB System
adopted a less accommodative position toward future borrowing by encouraging
1/ As market rates have risen further, additional states have moved to
liberalize or remove usury ceilings. Such legislation has recently been
enacted in Texas, Missouri, South Dakota, Minnesota and Tennessee. Aside
from these cases, usury ceilings in more than a dozen other states have
reportedly been pinching the supply of credit available.

members to first utilize their liquidity and by monitoring more closely mem-
bers' reasons for obtaining advances. In addition, the San Francisco district
raised its rates on advances.
With further increases in primary market rates on conventional home
mortgages coming during a period when rates on corporate bonds have declined
the gross yield spread favoring mortgages has increased to an unusually wide
margin. This incentive has stimulated renewed investment by life insurance
companies in home mortgages. Through the first four months of 1979, life
insurance companies committed nearly three-fifths more funds for home loans
than in the comparable period of last year.
In FNMA's latest (June 25) auction of forward purchase commitments,
which was based on a slim volume of offerings, yields rose further on conven-
tional loans and continued to decline on FHA/VA loans. Yields also declined
in the GNMA securities market.
Growth of consumer installment credit outstanding appeared somewhat
slower in May than in April, probably approximating the first-quarter pace.
With the weakness in car sales in June (especially for the larger, more expen-
sive models), the overall second-quarter growth may have been well below last
year's high. Commercial bank finance rates in May for new automobile loans
and mobile home loans were somewhat higher than in February, while rates for
personal and other consumer goods loans and credit card balances were little
changed.
The ratio of home mortgage and consumer credit repayments to dispos-
able personal income--which grew steadily from 1976-QII through 1978-QIII--
appears to have moved little since late 1978. The commercial bank consumer
loan delinquency rate series declined during the first quarter of 1979, after

remaining essentially constant from mid-1976 through 1978 at a level a little
below the peak at the end of the last business recession. In the two most
recent business cycles, increases in this indicator preceded the turndown
in economic activity by roughly seven quarters.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. For the first two weeks of the period
since the last green book in mid-May, the dollar's value in foreign-exchange
markets was under considerable upward pressure. The forces tending to
raise the dollar's value abated in early June, however, and gave way around
mid-month to strong downward pressure, which lasted until nearly the end
of the month.
The effect of the forces tending to push up the dollar's value
during the early part of the period can be seen in both the top and bottom
panels of Chart 1. The dollar's value fluctuated for about two weeks
around a level about one per cent higher than it had been in mid-May (upper
panel),
The favorable market evaluation of
the dollar's prospects during that period seemed to derive from published
data confirming an apparent slowing in U.S. economic activity and showing
a sharp decline in the leading-indicators series. In addition, evidence
became available that Japan's trade suplus was decreasing, and the yen
depreciated in terms of the dollar by about 3-1/2 per cent during the last
two weeks of May.
Market conditions were generally calm and the dollar traded in
a narrow range until the middle
of June, when -- soon after the Bank of England raised its minimum lending
rate by 2 percentage points -- figures were released showing a very sharp
acceleration in the growth of U.S. monetary aggregates. Market participants
seemed to view the new data, which came at time when some U.S. interest rates

were falling, as evidence that the Federal Reserve would not resist an easing
of financial conditions while U.S. economic activity slowed. The prospect
that U.S. inflation would diminish therefore dimmed somewhat. Moreover,
attention was focussed on an apparently sharp contrast between U.S. policies
and those of some other countries, where efforts to tighten financial
conditions had been in process for several months (as discussed below in
the section on foreign economic developments).
A highlighted feature of the apparent contrast was the narrowing
of interest differentials pictured in Chart 2. As shown there, many
foreign interest rates had been rising during the period this spring when
the foreign currencies were under downward pressure vis-a-vis the dollar.
The view of market participants that U.S. policies had changed
and were different from those of foreign authorities led to a very rapid
depreciation of the dollar. Intervention support was given to the dollar
by U.S. authorities , but the dollar declined
about 2-1/2 per cent during the last two weeks in June.

OPEC surpluses and investments. The OPEC current account surplus,
which almost disappeared in 1978, will soar in 1979 and will probably be the
largest since 1974 when it reached $70 billion. This will result principally
from steep increases in oil prices and secondarily from a slowing of OPEC
import growth. The current account surplus is expected to be about $45 billion
this year.
OPEC oil revenues, which in 1978 amounted to an estimated $131
billion, could rise 40 percent to $185 billion in 1979, assuming oil exports
volume of 28 million b/d (up slightly from 27.8 million b/d in 1978). This
projection is subject to uncertainties with regard to the level of the
average oil export price in the second half of the year, when marker prices
are scheduled to be lower in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar ($18/bbl.)
than in other countries (apparently $21-22/bbl.), which latter will also
continue to apply premiums. The projection in the table assumes an average
export price (including premia) in the second half of $21/bbl., which
compare- with $12.93 in 1978 (yearly average), $13.79 in the first quarter
of 1979, and an estimated $16.85 in the second quarter. Any difference
between the actual and the projected average export price in the second half
will change projected second-half oil export receipts by $5 billion for every
$1/bbl. of difference in price.
The dollar value of OPEC imports is expected to rise only about 8
percent in 1979, to $109 billion, compared with increases of 20 percent last
year and 25 percent in 1977. Import volume seems likely to show little if
any increase this year. In Iran the volume of imports may actually fall by

as much as 50 percent, in response to the change in Iran's economic attitudes,
the reduction in economic activity that now seems likely to persist most of
the year, and a backlog of goods built up during la-t year's customs and port
strikes. In dollar terms such a cutback in the volume of Iranian imports
would amount to around $10 billion. In Saudi Arabia the rate of increase
in import volume is expected to slow by one-half as the government stretches
out development programs or otherwise deliberately slows the pace of economic
expansion for socio-political reasons. Indonesia's devaluation last November
will temper import demand there. The growth in the dollar value of total
OPEC imports this year is also expected to be held down by a smaller rise in
the dollar value of import prices this year than last. This projection
reflects, a much smaller year-over-year decline in the weighted average
exchange rate of the dollar, with consequent smaller upward effect on the
dollar equivalent of prices of imports from countries other than the United
States. Total OPEC import prices in dollars may rise about 8-10 percent
thi year compared with 12 percent last year.
In other accounts, OPEC non-oil export are projected at $11 billion
in 1979, there is expected to be a smaller rise this year than last, to $39
billion, in the net deficit on services and private transfers, and little
change is expected in OPEC grant aid of about $4 billion. The foregoing
suggest a current account surplus of about $44 billion.
The OPEC investible surplus will rise this year by considerably less
then the current account surplus because of the lag in payments for oil in a
year of rising oil prices. This lag may cause a $9-10 billion rise in accounts
receivable from oil companies.

IV -8a
In the first ouarter of 1979 the OPEC current account surplus
appear- to have been about $6 billion, already several times larger than the
1978 quarterly average. Oil export- were up only moderately, reflecting both
the relatively mall rise in oil export prices in the first uarter (6.7 per-
cent from the 1978 average) and reduced export- from Iran; but Iranian imports
were down -harply. There was a net outflow of OPEC funds from the United
States of about $1 billion, and a net inflow of $0.4 billion into sterling
balances in the United Kingdom. Most of the first-quarter surplus appears
to have been invested in the Euro-currency markets.

U.S. International Transactions. The U.S. current account
balance shifted to a small surplus ($0.6 billion, annual rate) in the
first quarter of 1979 from a small (revised) deficit in the fourth
quarter of last year and a much larger deficit in the third quarter.
This was the first surplus recorded since the fourth quarter of 1976.
There were two major elements in this swing. The U.S. trade
deficit was reduced by $7½ billion, annual rate, between the third
quarter of 1978 and the first quarter of 1979. In addition, net direct
investment income receipts (revised data) increased by an unusually
large $8 billion annual rate over the same period.

In May the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, $33.7 billion at
an annual rate on an international accounts basis, was slightly larger
than the April deficit. See the chart on the next page. For April-May
combined, the deficit was larger than the first quarter average by $7
billion (annual rate).
In May, exports increased slightly from the April level but
for the two months averaged at about the first quarter rate. Increases
in exports of nonagricultural industrial supplies were about offset by
declines in exports of civilian aircraft and automotive equipment to
Canada. Exports of machinery have been little changed in value for four
months. Agricultural exports declined slightly in May, particularly
soybeans, but for the two months combined were little changed from the
first-quarter average.
Imports increased by about 4 per cent in May even though oil
imports declined. For April and May combined, the value of imports rose
by 4 per cent from the first quarter average.
Oil imports declined sharply in May to 8.2 million barrels per
day (mbd) bringing the average for April-May to 8.7 million barrels per
day. This was 6 per cent less than in the first quarter. Oil import
prices averaged $16.23 per barrel in May, 21 per cent higher than at
the end of last year.

On June 28, the OPEC oil ministers announced an increase in
oil prices effective July 1. The marker price was raised to $18 per
barrel which is 24 per cent higher than the marker price set April 1.
OPEC oil producers, other than Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and
Qatar, have set a base price of $20 per barrel plus some additional

IV -13
surcharges; however they indicated that the total price should not
exceed $23.50 per barrel. This means that on average the OPEC sales
price of petroleum could be raised to $16.85 per barrel in the second
quarter and $21 per barrel in the third and fourth quarters. The next
meeting of the OPEC oil ministers is scheduled for December 17, but
they indicated that they could meet earlier if it were judged necessary.
Intervention sales of dollars and U.S. repayments of swap
debt in April resulted in a $7.2 billion decline in foreign official
reserve holdings in the United States (line 14 in the table on page .)
.OPEC holdings of U.S.
securities and bank liabilities rose by slightly less than $500 million
in April, following a $1.7 billion fall in the first quarter of 1979.

ending June 20, OPEC countries' holdings at the FRBNY declined by
slightly more than $200 million; recent price increases are not yet
showing up in increased investments.
Bank-reported private capital transactions resulted in a net
private capital inflow of $2.4 billion in April (line 4), about half
the monthly average for the first quarter of 1979. Data for May show
that head offices of member banks continued to raise additional funds
through their foreign branches (about a $3 billion increase over the
month, comparing the daily average in the last week of May with the
daily average of the first week of May). In June (through the 20th)
the net outstanding amount of member banks' borrowings from their own
1/foreign branches showed little further change.
Foreign private purchases of dollar-denominated Treasury
securities rose to $1.4 billion in April from less than $500 million
in the first quarter of 1979. Over half of April's net private
purchases of Treasury bills was accounted for by one Japanese
securities firm.
Deposits Abroad of U.S. Manufacturing Corporations
In the past 4 years, the domestic operations of U.S.
manufacturing corporations have increased their deposits in banks
outside the United States from $1.5 billion to $8,8 billion (see
1/ On a daily average basis the change for May was $4.5 billion and
for June, $2.5 billion.

Table 1). Large corporations (with over $1 billion in net assets)
reported $6.7 billion of this increase. However, it is noteworthy
that the ratio of deposits outside the United States to total world-
wide deposits increased over the period for all size classes.
In the first quarter of 1979, the ratio of deposits outside
the United States to total deposits rose abruptly for large U.S. manu-
facturing corporations from 25 cents of every dollar deposited to 38
cents of every dollar deposited. These firms are thought to be among
the most aggressive cash managers and money-market investors.
Table 2 shows that the proportion of reporting firms holding
deposits outside the United States varies directly with the size of
firm -- two-fifths of reporters with more than $1 billion in net
assets showed deposits abroad while less than 2 per cent of firms with
less than $100 million in net assets reported holdings deposits out-
side the United States. A comparison of the proportion of corporations
depositing abroad in each size class for 1977IQ and 19791Q does not
show a marked charge in the percentage of firms depositing abroad.
This suggests that the recent surge in offshore deposits reflects
primarily a more intensive use of offshore accounts rather than an
increase in the number of domestic firms depositing abroad.

Foreign economic developments. Economic activity abroad, in
contrast to developments in the U.S., has been quite strong during the
first four months of this year. Industrial production -- although gen-
erally not maintaining the brisk pace of the second half of last year --
was stronger than in the first half of last year in Japan, Germany,
Canada, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Activity in Japan particularly
showed renewed signs of strength in April and May. Only the French
economy showed a decline in industrial production during the first four
months of this year. This generally strong foreign activity picture
is supported by improved labor market data. The seasonally adjusted rate
of unemployment in May was lower than its 1978 average in Japan, Germany,
Canada and Britain, the latter three countries having achieved a steady
decline in the rate during recent months. Only the French rate of
unemployment has been higher than in 1978 and has been rising recently.
Inflation in May has continued at high levels and the increase
in the price of oil has been a major inflationary factor in all
countries. Annualized rates of increase in the CPI for the first five
months of 1979 were as much as 7-1/2 percentage points above those for
the second half of last year in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.
In Canada and Japan the acceleration was somewhat more moderate at about
4 percentage points over the second half of last year. Recent monthly
rates have shown no clear signs in any country that inflation may be
abating. Foreign central banks accordingly have sought to continue and

to intensify their restraining policies: In Japan and Italy limits
on credit expansion were tightened. The Bundesbank, having once more
raised its lombard rate, also limited the banks' use of a new repurchase
facility. The United Kingdom reduced the target rate for monetary
growth from 8-12 percent to 7-11 percent and raised its minimum lending
rate. Other countries, such as Belgium and Denmark,have adopted re-
strictive measures, including discount rate increases, in order to avoid
depreciation of their currencies within the EMS.
Japan's current account (s.a.) continued its trend toward
adjustment in May, recording for the first five months of 1979 a deficit
of $162 million compared with a surplus of $8 billion for the comparable
period in 1978. The German current-account surplus (n.s.a.) also
declined from $2.9 billion for the first five months in 1978 to $1.9
billion in 1979.
Individual country notes. Strong inflationary pressure from
both external and internal sources continues to plague the Japanese
economy. In May, wholesale prices rose at a nearly 20 percent annual
rate, due in part to large increases in the price of imported oil, and
there are indications that a further substantial increase will be re-
corded in June. Consumer prices have followed a strong upward trend as
well in the three months ending in May the Tokyo CPI advanced at an
annual rate of 7.4 percent over its level in the previous three months.

IV -24
Interest rates have moved upward, reflecting the effects of
the mid-April discount-rate increase. But the impact of the tightening
of lending limits earlier this year on the money stock (M-2), which had
been expanding at a rate exceeding 20 percent (s.a.a.r.) in March and
April, is not yet clear. The recently announced expansion of lending
limits for the large city banks in the third quarter is 30 percent below
the increase of the previous year.
GNP growth in the first quarter, led by private investment, main-
tained the strong growth of late last year. The expansion of domestic
activity appears to be continuing in the second quarter. Industrial
production rose sharply in April and May, and strong gains were recorded
in retail sales and new construction orders. Recent business surveys
also continue to support a positive outlook for investment in private
plant and equipment.
The current-account (s.a.) increased by about $1/2 billion in
May, from its April level and was nearly balanced in May after showing
deficits in the previous two months. Preliminary data indicate that
higher dollar prices for Japanese imports were more than offset by a
substantial increase in the volume of Japanese exports.
German GNP for the first quarter of 1979 was flat
as a result of the steel workers' strike and bad weather early
this year. Other indicators of economic activity, on the
other hand, convey a more positive picture: The rate of unemployment

IV -25
has continued its gradual decline into May, when it was 3.7 percent(s.a.).
Industrial production,up only slightly from March to April, was re-
vised upward from February to March to an increase of 3.3 percent
(monthly rate). Capacity utilization improved further in April to a
level 3.5 percentage points above April 1978. The latest business
climate survey indicates further gains in positive responses, indi-
cating the most favorable outlook in years.
Consumer prices during the first six months of this year
have risen at an annual rate of 7.5 percent. A major factor in the
inflation picture has been import prices, which rose at a 27 percent
annual rate through May. About one-half of the rise in import prices
may be attributed to rising petroleum prices.
The monetary aggregates, while still growing at last year's
high rates during early 1979 have shown some slight indication of
deceleration in May. Central bank money has recently been growing
somewhat less rapidly than late last year and in May was 10.2 percent
above May 1978. This level is nearly consistent with the upper range of
be Bundesbank's target of 6 to 9 percent growth from the fourth quarter
of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979
The current-account surplus for the first five months of this
year, at $1.9 billion, was significantly lower than the comparable figure
of $2.9 billion for last year. The trade surplus, however, at $7 billion
for this year through May (n.s.a.), was only slightly below last year's
$7.5 billion.

IV -26
Inflation rates in the United Kingdom have increased markedly
in 1979 and the current-account balance has swung into deficit. Output,
after declining during the winter months, appears to be fairly strong --
the unemployment rate has been falling and industrial production is up
sharply from its winter levels. The current-account data are distorted
by last winter's labor disputes, including a dispute that delayed pub-
lication of the data. However, even after allowing for the distortions,
there appears to have been a sharp deterioration in the U.K.'s under-
lying current-account position so far this year.
In the May 3 general election, the Conservative Party defeated
the Labour Party and took over control of the government. The Conserva-
tives' program includes labor market reforms, cuts in government spending,
cuts in direct taxation as well as increases in indirect taxation,
liberalization of exchange controls, and an anti-inflation policy based
on monetary and fiscal policy. In its budget announcement on June 12
the new Conservative government took steps to implement its program.
The fiscal policy actions announced in the budget include de-
creases in (nominal) government spending amounting to some £3 billion,
decreases in direct taxes -- including reductions in the basic rate as
well as the highest marginal tax rate -- of about £3-1/2 billion, and an
increase in various indirect taxes (principally the value-added tax)
which will yield an additional £2-1/2 billion this fiscal year. In
addition, the government announced its intention to sell £i billion of its

IV -27
British Petroleum shares. The net effect of these moves is to reduce
the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in the fiscal year
ending March 1980 to about £8-1/4 billion (4-1/2 percent of GDP). In
the last fiscal year, the PSBR was 9-1/4 billion -- 5-1/2 percent of
GDP.
Monetary policy figured prominently in the government's
budget announcement. The target annual rate of growth of sterling
denominated M3 was reduced to a 7-11 percent range. (The previous
target was 8-12 percent.) In order to facilitate the achievement of
the target, the Bank of England's Minimum Lending Rate (MLR) was
raised from 12 percent to 14 percent and the system of quantitative
limits on the growth of banks' interest-bearing liabilities (the
corset) was extended for 3 months.
Some liberalization of exchange and capital controls was
announced also, including a relaxation of some restrictions on outward
direct investment.
The French economy has suffered reversals on almost all fronts
since the last quarter of 1978. Industrial production has been nearly flat
for the first four months of this year and was on the average only 1.4 per-
cent higher than in the last four months of 1978. Inflation is once
again accelerating, growing at an 11 percent annual rate during the last
three months including May. At about 6 percent (s.a.), the unemployment
rate in May was at its highest level since the series began in 1973.

IV -28
Early in the year, a strong foreign sector was being counted on
to provide some stimulus and to pay for oil price increases. For the
first quarter of this year the current account surplus was $770 million.
The trade surplus for the first four months was $400 million. However,
over two thirds of the accumulated surplus was nullified by a May deficit
of $280 million, reflecting the recent petroleum developments.
Real GDP in Canada rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
7.1 percent during the first quarter after rising only 3.1 percent in
the fourth quarter of last year. Growth was led by a 5.3 percent annual
rate increase in real consumption spending and by a strong accumulation
of inventories particularly in the export sector. In May, the unemploy-
ment rate (s.a.) fell to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent during the previous
three months. Consumer prices (n.s.a.) in May were over 9 percent above
the same month a year earlier; the non-food CPI was up by 8 percent. The
growth rates (s.a.a.r.) of all monetary aggregates relative to the June
1978 base period accelerated in May. Ml has grown by 8.2 percent (a.r.)
to move close to the center of the Bank of Canada's target band of 6 to
10 percent.
The Canadian current-account deficit (s.a.) narrowed slightly to
$1.4 billion in the first quarter from $1.5 in the fourth quarter of last
year. However, the merchandise trade surplus (s.a.) declined by 45 per-
cent from the previous quarter to $357 million and disappeared in April.

IV -29
The inflation rate in Italy remains at a very high level and
shows few signs of decelerating. Consumer prices have risen at an
annual rate of 18 percent between December and May, while the annual rate
of wholesale price inflation between December and April has been 20 per-
cent. Although price increases may slow somewhat over the next few
months, because of seasonal factors, the outlook is for continued high
inflation because of cost-push pressures. Wages are rising because of
wage-indexation and will rise further once the new labor contracts are
signed, more rent adjustments are expected, and much of the increase in
oil prices has not yet been passed on to product prices.
At the same time, activity continues to be strong. GDP rose
in the first quarter by 1 percent, and in April industrial production
rose by 1.6 percent. The outlook for the next few months still appears
good according to business surveys, and very low inventory levels should
impart some strength to activity.
Despite strong activity and accelerating inflation, the ex-
ternal situation is strong; on a customs basis (s.a.) the trade deficit
for the first four months was only about $90 million, implying a sub-
stantial current account surplus.
In Switzerland wholesale and consumer prices in the first five
months of 1979 rose at annual rate of 10.8 and 6.5 percent, respectively
compared with -2.3 and 0.8 percent for the year 1978. Import prices,
particularly for oil, continued to account for most of the increase of the
price indices.

IV -30
The recovery of economic activity in Belgium which began in
the last quarter of 1978 is threatened by rising interest rates in
addition to the depressing effects on activity resulting from the oil
situation. The Belgian central bank has raised its discount rate from
6 to 9 percent since May 1 to counter the Belgian franc's weakness in
the European Monetary System. The authorities had previously sought to
lower interest rates to stimulate private investment and reduce the
costs of financing the large public sector deficit.
The Danish government, also influenced by the EMS exchange
rate constraint, announced an austerity program in June. It's main
ingredients are increased taxes on energy products, some cuts in local
government spending, and a 1 percent increase in the discount rate to
9 percent. Also included is a one-day ban on driving each week.
