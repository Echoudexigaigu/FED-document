Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

DOMESTIC NONFINACIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent data suggest that the level of economic activity continued
to weaken early in the third quarter. Payroll employment growth slowed further
in July and industrial activity apparently declined for the third time in
the last four months. Auto production is being particularly affected by
weak sales and a record buildup of large car stocks. Both capital spending
and housing starts remained well below levels of late 1978. Consumer prices
through June increased at about the same rapid rate as in previous months
this year.
According to preliminary data, real gross national product declined
in the second quarter at a 3.3 percent annual rate, reflecting the impacts of
continuing rapid inflation and gasoline shortages on an already slowing economy.
Real consumer spending, which had increased only fractionally in the first
quarter, declined at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, with
particularly sharp reductions in spending on consumer durables. Outlays for
new capital equipment fell sharply, and housing expenditures continued to
decline. Final purchases fell faster than production, and the rate of inventory
accumulation moved substantially higher.
Employment and Production
As a result of the slowing in overall economic activity, labor
demand has weakened in recent months. Following employment gains averaging

325,000 per month in the first quarter of the year, employers added 150,000
workers per month to payrolls in the second quarter. In July employment
at nonfarm establishments rose only 45,000 from June. Factory employment
dropped 60,000 in July--the fourth consecutive monthly decline--with wide-
spread small cutbacks among producers of both durable and nondurable goods.
Total manufacturing employment is now down about 130,000 from its March
peak; in comparison, manufacturing employment fell by about 175,000 in the
first six months of the 1973-75 recession, but as that recession deepened,
the drop in factory employment reached about 2-1/3 million.
Employment in the transportation equipment industry, which had
been declining since March, was little changed last month. However, since
the July survey week, automakers have announced further layoffs and have
extended scheduled downtime for model changeover at many of their large-car
and truck assembly plants. The overall factory workweek--at 40.2 hours--was
about unchanged in July. Outside of manufacturing, construction employment
advanced somewhat further and small hiring gains occurred in most service-
producing industries. However, retail trade employment was lower for the
second month in a row.
Total employment, as measured by the household survey, rose 450,000
in July, but unemployment was little changed. The overall jobless rate edged
up to 5.7 percent; jobless rates for most experienced and skilled workers were
little different from those prevailing since last August. While monthly
movements in the household and establishment surveys have diverged several
times this year, both surveys have shown a similar slackening in labor demand
since March.

II -4
Available data suggest that industrial production declined by a
small amount again in July. After an uneven performance during the first
half of 1979, the index for June was only fractionally above its December
1978 level. The further decline estimated for July reflects reduced output
of cars and other consumer goods as well as a decrease in the production
of trucks. Auto assemblies, which were at an annual rate of 8.8 million
units in July, were only about 3 percent lower than in June, but industry
schedules have been trimmed sharply to a 7.3 million unit rate in August
in order to reduce dealer inventories of the less fuel-efficient models.
Business equipment output apparently was about unchanged in July as small
advances in some machinery industries were offset by a decline in production
of business vehicles. In addition, there apparently was a small decrease in
the output of materials. With the probable decline in production, capacity
utilization rates in manufacturing also edged lower to about 1-3/4 percentage
points below its highest recent level in March 1979.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Real personal income declined again in June as growth in nominal
income slowed and prices of consumer goods continued to rise rapidly. In
nominal terms, total personal income rose at a $9-1/2 billion annual rate in
June, bringing the average monthly gain during the second quarter to slightly
more than $10 billion--down from the $15 billion average during the preceding
three months. Monthly increases in private wages and salaries between March
and June averaged less than $4 billion at an annual rate compared with a

rate of more than $10 billion earlier in the year. In real terms, total
personal income declined through the second quarter and by June was off more
than 2 percent (not annual rate) from its December peak.
Reflecting in part the declines in income, weakness in consumer
spending continued in June as total retail sales in current dollars declined
about 1 percent. These sales have now dropped for three months in a row and
are slightly below their level for December 1978. Sales declines have been
most apparent in the automotive sector,but there also has been a widespread
slowing in nonautomotive sales as well. Excluding autos and nonconsumption
items, nominal retail sales in June were only fractionally higher for the
third month in a row, while sales of general merchandise, apparel, and furni-
ture (GAF)--an indicator of discretionary consumer spending--declined in June.
Consumer outlays for automobiles have fallen sharply since early
spring in association with higher debt burdens and uncertain income and energy
prospects. Total domestic auto sales in July were at an 8.1 million unit rate,
higher than in June, but still about 10 percent below the January to April
average. Large car sales increased somewhat in July, but remained at a low
level; as a result, stocks of large cars relative to current sales increased
to record levels. Small car sales--both domestic and foreign--generally have
been strong and might have been higher but for tight supplies. So far the
drop in domestic auto sales in the past year is smaller than the drop during
the 1973-74 period. Sales in the May-July period were down more than 20 percent
from their quarterly peak in the second quarter of last year. In the 1973-74
period, sales ultimately fell more than 40 percent from their peak to their
trough.

II -8
Measures of consumer attitudes continued to decline in July as both
the University of Michigan and Conference Board surveys indicated consumer
confidence to be at the lowest level since the 1974-75 recession. The further
weakening of the Michigan index in July mainly reflected lowered consumer
expectations of future business conditions. The Conference Board results
stemmed both from a less favorable appraisal of current economic conditions
than in the previous survey and reduced expectations of future economic
prospects.
Business Investment
Business investment spending remained sluggish through June, mainly
because of reduced shipments of capital equipment. Shipments of nondefense
capital goods fell about 2 percent in June, and in the second quarter as a
whole were down 0.4 percent from the first quarter. In addition, truck sales
continued to decline through June. On the other hand, nonresidential
construction expenditures remained strong, rising 7 percent (not an annual
rate) in the second quarter following a weather-related dip during the
winter.
Near-term capital spending commitments have recouped some of their
earlier weakness as orders for nondefense capital goods rose 5-3/4 percent in
June following a 2 percent increase in May. However, because of a large
decline in April, the level of these orders in June--in current dollars--was
still somewhat below the recent March peak. New orders for the machinery
component of these capital goods--which is indicative of underlying near-term
equipment demand--increased 2-1/3 percent in June, but these orders as
well were still below their March peak.

Recent business commitments for construction spending suggest that
some slackening of demand has emerged. In the first half of 1979 total
contracts for private construction in current dollars were about 10 percent
below their average for 1978 as a whole, though commitments in the building
area did increase noticeably in June after having edged lower through most of
the spring.
Inventories
Inventory investment at the manufacturing level continued at a
rapid pace through the end of the second quarter, but significant overhangs
do not appear to have emerged. Manufacturers' inventories in book value terms
increased at an annual rate of $37-1/2 billion in June, well above the May rate
of accumulation. For the second quarter as a whole,stocks were accumulated at
a $36 billion rate--the largest quarterly advance since the third quarter of
1974. Manufacturers' shipments in June declined substantially, in part because
of fuel and trucking disruptions. As a result the ratio of total manufacturers'
inventories to shipments increased substantially, but is still generally in
the normal range by historical standards.
Manufacturers' durable goods stocks grew at a $25 billion annual rate
in June, with large advances for nonelectrical machinery and fabricated metals.
In contrast, producers of motor vehicles and parts reduced inventories as they
cut back production. Stocks of nondurable goods rose in June at a $12-1/2 bil-
lion annual rate; much of this accumulation was concentrated in the food indus-
try, probably reflecting shipping delays brought on by the independent truckers'

protest. By stage-of-fabrication, manufacturers' inventories of finished
goods increased in June at a $12 billion annual rate; excluding the strike-
related buildup of April, this June advance was the largest monthly increase
in over two years.
Residential Construction
Total private housing starts increased 6 percent in June to a
1.9 million unit annual rate, and building permits also edged up. Both indica-
tors of new construction activity rebounded in the second quarter from the
first quarter when they had been depressed, in part, by severe weather.
Nonetheless, the pace of starts and permits in the second quarter were well
below the recent peaks reached in 1978.
Multifamily housing activity rebounded in May and June, following
five months of reduced activity. This recent strength in the multifamily
sector appears to reflect both increased HUD subsidized (Sec. 8) units in
June and continued demand pressures. Rental vacancy rates (largely reflecting
multifamily units) edged up slightly in the second quarter from the record
low recorded in the first quarter of the year.
Activity in the single-family market has been relatively stable in

tially unchanged from April's pace, which was below the already reduced rate
of sales in the first quarter. With sales dropping, the stock of unsold new

homes has been increasing, and in April and May the inventory of unsold homes
represented more than 7 months' supply at current sales rates--the highest
since September 1975.
Government Sector
The federal budget, on a seasonally-adjusted NIA basis, moved further
toward surplus during the second quarter, as personal tax receipts rose at a
21 percent annual rate while total expenditures grew at a 6 percent annual
rate, about the same rate of increase as in the first quarter.
The continued strength in federal tax receipts during the second
quarter reflected surprisingly large final settlements on 1978 tax liabilities
and higher than expected personal income tax withholding. Growth in federal
outlays was held down by higher loan repayments from farmers to the Commodity
Credit Corporation (CCC), which are handled as negative expenditures in the
national income accounts, and by a reduced "fill rate" for the strategic
petroleum reserve (SPR). Even though CCC loan repayments and a further reduc-
tion in SPR oil purchases are expected to reduce net outlays during the current
quarter, total federal spending is expected to rebound because of the recent
10 percent cost of living increase for social security recipients ($9.6 billion
at an annual rate), an expected rise in unemployment benefits, and continued
strong defense spending.
State and local capital outlays as measured by the value of con-
struction put-in-place declined by 6 percent in June. Building and highway
construction accounted for the bulk of this decline. Nominal construction

activity has made up less than half of the large loss that occurred in January
and February, and in real terms state and local construction activity in June
was down 13-1/2 percent from last December.
After posting employment gains of about 30,000 per month in the
second quarter, state and local government payrolls increased by 10,000 in
July. Public service employment as of the end of June totaled 592,000.
Title II employment has reached its target level and is expected to remain
at this level for the duration of fiscal 1979.
Prices
Aggregate price measures continue to indicate rapid rates of infla-
tion in the economy. The GNP deflator increased at nearly a 10 percent annual
rate over the first two quarters of 1979, and the consumer price index increased
at about a 13-1/4 percent rate over the December-June period. This persistance
of high inflation rates during a period of declining economic activity does not
appear unusual; in the earlier cyclical downturns of the 1970's, overall infla-
tion rates did not decelerate significantly until the latter stages of those
recession periods.
The rate of increase in consumer prices in June was nearly as large
as in previous months, as energy prices posted their largest monthly advance on
record--5.6 percent. Indications are that these large energy price increases
have continued into the third quarter.
Food prices slowed in June to a 2 percent annual rate of increase
as earlier declines in farm prices showed up at grocery stores. Retail meat
prices fell in June and further declines appear likely in the near-term because

of a large drop in livestock prices at the farm level. Even with the June
slowing, however, food prices rose at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate over the
first half of the year.
Outside the food and energy sectors, the CPI has been rising at
a 10-1/4 percent rate since the beginning of the year, compared with an
8-1/2 percent rise during 1978. The main factor in this acceleration has
been homeownership costs; a further large rise in June brought the annual
rate of increase in this grouping to 17 percent over the first half of the
year. Increases in new car prices slowed in June, but these prices rose
over the first half of the year at a 12-3/4 percent annual rate. Prices for
apparel and used cars continued to edge downward in June.
Wages
The average hourly earnings index rose at an 8-1/2 percent annual
rate in July, continuing the recent pattern of relatively moderate increases.
Over the first seven months of 1979, this index has risen at just under an
8 percent annual rate. The preliminary measure of hourly compensation in
the nonfarm business sector for the second quarter increased at a reduced
7-3/4 percent annual rate, but remained 9-1/4 percent above a year earlier.
Collective bargaining agreements reached in the second quarter for
workers covered by major agreements (1,000 or more workers) yielded first-year
wage increases averaging 9 percent; increases in wages and benefits for those
in large bargaining units averaged 10-1/2 percent. Because 1979 has a heavier
collective bargaining schedule than that in 1978, newly negotiated wage
increases will be a more important component of overall wage changes this year

than last. Nevertheless, cost-of-living and deferred increases combined
have accounted for most of the wage increase for unionized workers so far
this year. In several recent contracts--notably in the rubber, airline, and
electrical equipment industries--workers have been successful in negotiating
improved cost-of-living coverage.
Productivity and Costs
Output per hour in the total private economy is estimated to have
declined for a second consecutive quarter in the second quarter of 1979. In
the nonfarm business sector, real output fell at a 5-1/2 percent annual rate
while hours of work rose fractionally, resulting in a drop at a 5-3/4 percent
rate in measured productivity; this followed a 3 percent annual rate decline
in the first quarter. In contrast, output per hour in the manufacturing
sector is estimated to have rebounded at a 3-1/4 percent rate in the second
quarter after falling at a 2 percent rate in the preceding quarter. The
particularly dismal productivity performance in the first half of this year
for the nonfarm business sector follows an increase of 1-1/2 percent during
the four quarters of 1978--a rate of growth in line with recent estimates of
its longer run trend. Last year's increase in manufacturing productivity
was 1-3/4 percent, according to revised estimates.
The weak productivity growth in the first half of 1979 combined
with continued rapid increases in hourly compensation resulted in unit labor
costs in the private economy rising at about a 14 percent annual rate--a
sharp acceleration from the increase of just over 8 percent last year. In
manufacturing, unit labor costs rose at a 6 percent annual rate in the
second quarter to a level 7 percent above a year ago.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Net borrowing by the private domestic nonfinancial sectors appears
to have declined a bit recently as the pace of economic activity has slowed.
Although nonfinancial firms maintained both their pace of borrowing from
banks and their strong issuance of commercial paper, their public bond
offerings dropped substantially during July. In the household sector,
growth of consumer credit declined over the course of the second quarter,
and, though residential mortgage borrowing rebounded in the spring, available
evidence suggests a fall-off in July State and local bond offerings also
declined during the month, in part due to reduced sales of mortgage revenue
bonds. The Treasury, on the other hand has been a net borrower this summer
following a seasonal paydown of debt in the second quarter.
Growth of the monetary aggregates continue rapid in July. M-1
is estimated to have increased at a 10-3/4 percent annual rate and M-2 at
a 13 percent rate. Savings deposits at commercial banks registered a second
straight monthly advance, and an upturn in large time deposits offset some
slowing in the strong growth of small time accounts. At S&Ls and MSBs,
total deposit growth was moderate, with reports indicating that reliance by
S&Ls on large-denomination CDs declined after a record inflow in June.
In response to strong monetary growth, weakness of the dollar on
foreign exchange markets, and continued rapid inflation, the Federal Reserve
discount rate was raised in July by one-half percentage point to 10 percent,
an all-time high. The federal funds rate rose to around 10-5/8 percent, after
trading at about 10-1/4 percent since late April. Most other domestic money
market rates have risen 15 to 30 basis points over the intermeeting period,
while Eurodollar rates have risen somewhat more--a pattern fairly common

during periods of weakness in the dollar. Long-term bond yields have risen
as well, but by considerably less than short-term interest rates.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M-1 growth in July while below the June pace, was about equal to
the average rate of increase in this aggregate over the spring months. The
diversion of funds from demand deposits to ATS and New York NOW accounts
is estimated to have reduced measured M-1 growth last month by only 1-1/4
percentage points, about the same as in the second quarter and considerably
less than the 2-3/4 percentage-point effect in the first. Given the behavior
of income and interest rates, the sharp increase in M-1 during July provides
further evidence that the underlying demand for transactions balances has
recovered from its extraordinary weakness early in the year.
Savings deposits at commercial banks posted a second straight
monthly increase in July after eight months of almost uninterrupted decline.
Savings accounts of individuals were especially strong, growing at an 11
percent annual rate. In addition, noncompetitive tenders for Treasury bills
and inflows to money market mutual funds picked up in July. Taken together,
these recent developments--occuring against a backdrop of weak retail sales
and deteriorating consumer sentiment--suggest that households may have been
accumulating liquid assets in lieu of making major outlays or longer-term
1/
investment commitments.
1/ A survey of 60 banks across the nation, conducted by the Federal Reserve
Banks, indicated that those bankers who observed unusual strength in savings
deposits at their banks in June and July most often cited as principal causes
reduced household consumption spending and abatement of the public's sizable
adjustment to the rapid rise in interest rates that occurred last fall. All
but a few banks reported raising their interest rates on savings accounts
to the new 5-1/4 percent ceiling authorized on July 1, and several cited
this change as an explanation for enhanced growth in savings deposits.
Contrary to press reports, few banks have implemented or are considering
cost-reducing changes in other terms on savings accounts to offset the
higher interest rate.

Growth of M-2 diminished slightly in July owing to the slower
expansion of -1. Along with the pick-up in savings deposit inflows in
July, growth in the time deposit component of M-2 accelerated, reflecting
an upturn in large-denomination time deposits that more than offset slower,
1/
but nevertheless brisk, growth in small tie accounts. The July increase
in the average level of large time deposits outstanding, following four
months of substantial declines, was due partly to end-of-quarter window
dressing and partly to the appearance both early and late in the month
of a cost differential favoring domestic CDs over Eurodollar borrowings
as a source of funds for banks. Member banks are estimiated to have aug-
mented their net liabilities to their foreign branches by only $100 million,
in contrast to an average monthly increase of $3 billion over the first
half of the year.
Deposit growth at thrift institutions is estimated to have decel-
erated slightly in July. On an end-of-month basis, deposit inflows at S&Ls
and MSPs slowed to about 6-3/4 percent from 10-1/4 percent in June. Deposit
growth at S&Ls in the earlier month had been raised by record issuance of
large-denomination CDs with an apparent weakening in mortgage loan demand
and a pickup in funds obtained through mortgage-backed bonds, S&L issuance
of large CDs may have been reduced in July. Net issuance of MMCs at S&Ls
picked up in July, as it often has in the first month of the quarter, a
traditionally important reinvestment period at these institutions.
Total bank credit grew at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate in July,
moderately below its pace in June. Expansion of total loans decelerated

small time deposits other than MMCs.

from the month earlier rate. Real estate lending slowed, while security
loans, after advancing rapidly in June declined in July as dealers in
U.S. government securities reduced their holdings considerably. Growth
in business loans continued at the June pace.
Bank portfolios of U.S. government securities expanded by $1.9
billion, in July, continuing the pattern of net acquisitions that began
at the start of the year. In the first seven months of 1979, banks increased
their holdings of Treasury securities by $8.8 billion, seasonally adjusted,
after an equal decline in the last quarter of 1978 when the spreads between
yields on competing short-term domestic and foreign private obligations,
such as bankers acceptances and Eurodollars, and the yield on Treasury
bills rose substantially (see chart on page III-8). It appears that some
large banks acquired these U.S. government obligations this year in part
as collateral to satisfy increased customer demands for security RPs. In
addition, some banks may have responded to the relative improvement in
yields on Treasury bills by acquiring these instruments to enhance their
liquidity positions in preparation for potential takedowns of their record
volume of unused loan commitments.
Business Finance
Growth of business loans at banks was virtually unchanged at a
16-3/4 annual rate in July, down from the 20-1/2 percent growth rate
over the previous six months. Net issuance of commercial paper by nonfinan-
cial corporations exceeded the strong second quarter pace, owing partly to
large sales by foreign issuers. The difficulties experienced by Chrysler
Financial Corporation following the loss of its commercial paper rating
at the end of July have had no apparent spillover effect on investors'
attitudes toward other sellers. Dealers report that lower-rated paper

issuers have continued to be able to raise cash, and the interest rate
differential between high- and lower-grade commercial paper seems to have
been unaffected.
Cross public offerings of corporate bonds fell to $1.8 billion in
July, less than half the previous month's total. A portion of this sharp
decline is attributable to the earlier acceleration of offerings originally
scheduled for July in order to take advantage of the June Lond market rally.
Public bond offerings by nonfinancial corporations were especially light
in July, largely because of an unusually small slate of offerings by public
utilities. Public issues by industrial firms were well below the June total
but remained somewhat above the average monthly volume of the first five
months of 1979. July's slate of financial issues also was smaller than June's,
but the decline was moderate, and the total remained quite large.
Corporate bond yields have increased about 15 basis points since the
July FOMC meeting, and the Board's index of recently offered, Aaa-rated
utility bond yields currently stands at 9.57 percent. Measures of risk premia
recently have widened somewhat, but remain narrow by historical standards.
These spreads typically have widened appreciably during previous postwar
economic contractions, although not until several months past the peak in
activity.
Gross public offerings of common and preferred stock totaled about
$600 million in July, somewhat more than the average for the first half of
1979. As in other recent months, public utilities accounted for well over
half of all new equity issues in July. Manufacturing and other industrial
concerns generally have avoided issuing new equity recently, owing to the
low level of price-earnings ratios. The average price-earnings ratio for
Standard and Poor's 500 stock index is currently about 7.6, only slightly

above its postwar low of 7.2 in 1974. Major stock price indexes have
risen in recent days and now are near or above their previous highs for
the year.
Municipal Securities
Gross sales of tax-exempt bonds dropped in July following an
unusually large calendar of offerings in June. At $3.3 billion, July's
volume was close to the average pace of the first half of the year. The
volume of new capital raised by state and local governments shrank from
$3.4 billion (seasonally adjusted) to about $2.7 billion in July, while
the value of refunding and advance refunding issues increased slightly
during the month
The volume of housing revenue bond issues declined in July and
has averaged around $500 million in the past three months, compared to
$890 million in the first four months of the year. The fall-off in issu-
ance has occurred in the single-family area in response to Congressional
consideration of legislation that would severely limit tax exemption of
bonds issued after April 24 for the purpose of subsidizing single-family
1/
house purchases.
Yields on long-term tax-exempt securities have risen along with
taxable bond yields since the July FOMC meeting. The Bond Buyer index on
August 2 was 6.14 percent, up 6 basis points. Because the yields on taxable
bonds rose relatively more over this period, the ratio of tax-exempt to

would permit the marketing of the $3.2 billion of such issues that had
been in process when the bill was first introduced, and the Senate has
passed a resolution concurring in these "transition rules". Most of the
single-family revenue bonds issued in recent weeks have been offerings
that were "in the pipeline" in late April, and consequently would be
allowed under the transition rules.

taxable yields fell to a 1979 low. A rising demand by individuals for tax-
exempt bonds is evidenced by a pickup in sales of unit investment trusts
(UITs) and sales of mutual funds investing in tax-exempt securities. Flows
into UITs averaged over $300 million per month in May, June, and July,
$100 million more than the average of the previous four months. Average
monthly sales of tax-exempt mutual funds were about $50 million higher in
May and June than during the first four months of 1979 (see table on
page III-12).
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Securities Markets
After their recent increases, interest rates on Treasury securities
currently lie between the levels prevailing in early May--when most Treasury
rates were at or near their cyclical peaks--and the levels prevailing in
late June or early July--when most rates were at or close to their 1979
lows. There is evidence, however, that the market generally expects
short-term interest rates to decline in the near future. For example, the
spread between the very short-term Federal funds rate and other short-term
interest rates has continued to widen during recent weeks, and prices in
the futures market for three-month Treasury bills indicate an expectation
of substantial rate declines by early 1980.
In its August mid-quarter refunding operation, the Treasury raised
a total of $2.4 billion of new cash, offering $7.3 billion of gross new
issues to the public in a standard package consisting of $2.8 billion of
three-year notes, $2.5 billion of reopened 7-1/2 year notes, and $2.0 billion
of reopened 29-3/4 year bonds. As a result of this operation, together with
$3.5 billion of new cash raised through regular cycle notes and bonds in early
July, the Treasury has accomplished about $6 billion of marketable net new

III-14
borrowing so far in the third quarter. In addition, the Treasury has obtained
$1.3 million of new cash since midyear through the sale of nonmarketable
issues, primarily special issues to foreign official accounts.
Federally sponsored credit agencies are estimated to have raised
S1.9 billion of new cash in July, on a seasonally adjusted offerings basis,
about the same as the average monthly borrowing rate in the second quarter.
The greater part of the July total--about $1.2 billion--was raised by the
Farm Credit Fanks, owing largely to continued strength in agricultural real
estate loans made by Federal Land Banks. Among the housing credit agencies,
FHLBs borrowed about S700 million, seasonally adjusted, in July, while FNMA
ran off a small amount of notes, using its liquid assets to finance mortgage
purchases.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage lending may have eased in July following a strong second
quarter rebound. Bank real estate loans grew more slowly, and mortgage
commitments outstanding at S&Ls edged down further in June. Moreover, field
reports suggest that there has been some slackening in loan demand in response
to the rise in mortgage interest rates this year and to general economic
uncertainty. Even though deposit growth at thrifts slowed in July, and the
percentage of sampled S&Ls reporting that funds were in short supply edged
downward only slightly, and interest rates on commitments to make new con-
ventional home loans fell slightly after peaking early in the month. Changes
in mortgage yields in national secondary markets have been mixed since the
last FOMC meeting, with yields in FNMA forward commitment auctions declining
a bit but yields on GNMA-guaranteed securities increasing somewhat. The
wide spread still prevailing between, hone mortage rates and corporate

bond yields appears to be attracting alternative investors and providing a
continued incentive for the creation of mortgage-related securities.
Given current levels of mortgage interest rates, usury ceilings
continue to constrain the supply of conventional home mortgage funds in a
1/
number of states. Because national banks may charge up to 1 percent above
the Federal Reserve discount rate, regardless of any state usury ceiling,
the recent increase in the discount rate to 10 percent should enhance the
incentive for national banks to finance conventional home mortgages in those
states where rate ceilings are binding.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit growth decelerated to a 12 percent
annual rate in June, which kept the average second-quarter growth rate about
the same as in the first--15 percent, 4 percentage points below last year's
average rate of expansion. Monthly figures indicate that, on balance, growth
in automobile credit outstanding has been slowing in recent months as car
sales have fallen off. Non-automotive credit also weakened in June after
strong expansion in April and May.
Recent evidence on the ability of households to meet their debt
obligations is mixed. Although not unusually high by historical standards,
personal bankruptcies in the second quarter were about 11 percent higher
than in the first quarter, and about 20 percent higher than in the second
quarter of last year. Mortgage aelinquency rates at S&Ls remained near
a seven-year low, however.
1/ New Jersey, New York, and Texas are among the larger states with the most
restrictive ceilings. The ceiling rate in Texas will be tied to market rates
(with a 12 percent cap) before the end of August. The current ceiling rate in
New York, however, is only 10 percent and an additional quarter-point increase
will not be allowed until November.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. The dollar continued under heavy selling
pressure during the first three weeks of July but recovered late in the
month and has remained steady so far in August. Over the five week period
since the last green book the dollar's average exchange value has shown a
net decline of about 2/3 per cent.
The dollar's fluctuations over this period continued to be heavily
influenced by market perceptions of U.S. economic policy. Strong downward
presssure on the dollar had developed at mid-June when a sharp acceleration
in the growth of U.S. monetary aggregates generated market speculation that
the Federal Reserve might not resist an easing of financial conditions as U.S.
economic activity slowed. Moreover, U.S. monetary policy was viewed as
diverging from that abroad, where monetary conditions in several major
countries appeared to be tightening (as discussed below in the section on
foreign economic developments). The announcement of sharply higher oil
prices at the OPEC ministers' meeting in late June shifted the focus of
attention to U.S. energy policy, and the cancellation of a scheduled energy
message by the President followed by news reports that the administration
did not plan to decontral domestic oil prices, triggered further selling
pressure on the dollar in early July. Downward pressure on the dollar
intensified at mid-July when the announcement of cabinet resignations
heightened uncertainty over U.S. economic policies. As shown in the top
panel of Chart 1, between mid-June and late July the average exchange value
of the dollar fell by over 5 per cent.

.The reversal
of the dollar's decline in late July followed the naming of new cabinet
members and a new Federal Reserve Chairman, and statements by U.S. officials
on the necessity of reducing inflation and stabilizing the dollar. Interest
rates and discount rates were raised both in the United States and in several
foreign countries in July. Announcements of discount rate increases by the
Federal Reserve, Germany, Japan, Canada and the Netherlands appear to
have had little net effect on the dollar's exchange value.
Both the rise and subsequent decline of foreign currencies against
the dollar over the past five weeks was led by the British pound. Sterling
appreciated by nearly 6 per cent against the dollar in early July, influenced
by Britain's increasingly valuable North Sea oil holdings and the restrictive
economic policies announced by the new U.K. government. However, later
announcements of Nigeria's intention to nationalize U.K. oil holdings
and an acceleration of U.K. inflation in July triggered a sharp drop in
the pound nearly equal in magnitude to the earlier rise.
Operations by the Desk since the beginning of July resulted in net
intervention support for the dollar of $2.3 billion. This intervention
took the form almost exclusively of net sales of German marks,

Total outstanding System mark swap drawings rose to just under $2 billion
equivalent. A swap-financed sale of $32 million equivalent of Swiss francs
by the System at mid-July was subsequently fully reversed.

U.S. International Transactions. In June the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit (international accounts basis) was $32.2 billion at an annual rate,
slightly larger than the revised May deficit. For the second quarter as a
whole, the deficit was at a rate of $30.6 billion, about $6 billion larger
than in the first quarter. See the chart on the following page.
In the second quarter, exports increased by about 3 percent with
virtually all of the increase in nonagricultural shipments (estimated to be
about half in price and half in volume). Industrial supplies (particularly
nonferrous metals and chemicals) and machinery showed the largest increases.

Civilian aircraft exports, which were very strong in the first quarter,
declined somewhat in the second. Agricultural exports were about the same
as in the first quarter -- increases in grain and tobacco offset a decline
in soybeans. The recently announced increase in Soviet wheat purchases
is expected to result in only a small increase in U.S. agricultural
exports above the rate previously anticipated by the staff.
Imports in the second quarter were at a 6 percent higher rate than
in the first quarter. About half of the increase was in oil imports; oil
imports totaled nearly $52 billion (annual rate) in the second quarter, $5
billion (annual rate) higher than in the first quarter. While the volume
of oil imported decreased to 8.7 million barrels per day (MMB/d) from the
first quarter rate of 9.3 MMB/d, the price of imported oil increased sharply--
from an average of $13.95 per barrel in the first quarter to an average of
$16.31 per barrel in the second quarter. By June the price of U.S. oil
imports was 32 percent higher than in December 1978. The increase in non-oil
imports was spread over various commodity categories with the largest
increases in industrial supplies and in the value of foreign cars.
The level of U.S. oil imports in recent months was affected by
the rate of U.S. crude oil production, which was lower than anticipated in
the first four months of 1979. U.S. production was expected to resume
its previous decline (starting in 1973) as Alaskan production leveled off
this year. However, the unexpectedly large drop-off in production was
comparable in magnitude to the loss of U.S. access to Iranian crude oil
during this period. Possible explanations for the production shortfall

include bad weather and a lock-in of U.S. crude oil in anticipation of
now-scheduled complete decontrol of its price in 1981.
.In addition, the Treasury ran
down its holdings of foreign currencies by about $2.5 billion.
OPEC holdings of U.S. securities and bank liabilities fell by
$1.1 billion in June, and for the second quarter as a whole there was
a net increase of $100 million. In July (through the 25th) OPEC holdings
at the FRBNY rose by about $400 million. Recent price increases and
tightening of credit terms by OPEC have not as yet shown up in increased
investments in the United States.
Bank-reported private capital transactions resulted in a net
private capital outflow of $2.4 billion in June, contributing to a $5.5
billion net inflow in the second quarter. Data for July show that head
offices of member banks raised only about $100 million of additional
funds through their foreign branches compared with a monthly average
increase of $3 billion in the second quarter. This reduced rate of head
office borrowing from own foreign branches may reflect a strenghtening
in credit activity at the foreign branches of U.S. banks.

IV-10
Nonbank U.S. Residents' Deposits in the Caribbean Branches of
Member Banks. Responses have been received from 23 member banks to a
special survey of offshore deposits held by nonbank U.S. residents on the
last business day of each of the three most recent quarters. The survey
was taken to determine whether part of the recent strong growth in the
deposits of U.S. residents at the Caribbean branches of member banks has
been associated with an introduction on a larger scale of overnight offshore
deposits into corporate cash management programs. The survey responses
appear to confirm earlier reports to this effect.
The responses to the survey reveal that U.S. residents hold
a sizable amount of deposits subject to transfer in immediately available
funds at the Caribbean branches of member banks. It is believed that such
overnight deposits are regarded by U.S. corporations as close substitutes
for domestic demand deposits and overnight RPs.

IV -12
Foreign Economic Developments. In several major industrial countries,
economic activity seems to be quite strong, with no evidence so far of an effect
of higher oil prices on real demand. In Germany and Japan, especially, indicators
suggest strong activity; industrial production, for example, increased about 10
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter in those two countries. In France, how-
ever, GDP growth (s.a.a.r.) declined to 1.7 percent in the first quarter of this
year from 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1978 and unemployment is high and
increasing, while in Canada the strong first quarter growth was not sustained in
the second quarter. In all major industrial countries, inflation continues to run
at a high rate and has accelerated in Japan and the United Kingdom in recent months
In response partly to these developments, as well as to exchange-market
pressures in some cases, most countries have announced measures to tighten monetary
conditions. Japan, Germany, Italy, and Canada have raised official interest rates
and/or tightened credit ceilings. In the United Kingdom's June 12 budget announce-
ment, summarized in last month's green book, both monetary and fiscal policy were
tightened. France has not announced any change in monetary policy, although short-
term interest rates have risen recently.
In several key countries, however, the evolution of the monetary aggre-
gates indicates that the tightening has been moderate. In Japan, the money stock
(M-2, s.a.) has remained about 12 percent above last year's corresponding levels,
and the Bank of Japan projects that M-2 growth will not slacken appreciably in the
third quarter. In Germany and Canada, the latest data show the money stock near
the upper boundary of the respective target ranges.
The current-account figures for Japan and Germany show marked reductions
from last year's high surpluses. For the first half of 1979, Japan recorded a

IV -13
deficit (s.a.) of $360 million, compared with a surplus of $6.2 billion in the
second half of 1978, while the German surplus (n.s.a.) declined from $3.8 billion
in the first half of 1978 to $0.3 billion in the first half of 1979.
Individual Country Notes. As the domestic economy in Japan continues to
show signs of strength, concern among Japanese authorities has shifted increas-
ingly to the control of inflation. In recent months, inflation has worsened as
additional price pressures from domestic sources have exacerbated the effects of
recent oil price increases. Wholesale prices in June were more than 7 percent
above their level at the end of 1978 and in recent months have advanced at annual
rates close to 15 percent. Consumer prices during the second quarter increased at
an annual rate exceeding 10 percent, despite a brief deceleration in June. Indus-
trial production increased by over 9-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.) during the second
quarter, and there are no indications yet that the strength in investment observed
in the first quarter has been dissipated by the uncertainties from higher inflation.
The Japanese authorities have taken several steps to attempt to moderate
the pace of inflation without undermining the expansion of the domestic economy.
On July 24, the discount rate was raised by one percentage point to 5.25 percent,
a step that followed by three months a 0.75 percentage point increase. At the end
of June, the Bank of Japan also announced that the increase in lending limits for
large city banks in the third quarter would be about a third less than in the cor-
responding quarter of 1978. As a result, this will be the third consecutive quarter
of significantly smaller increases in city bank lending limits and the second
straight quarter in which increases will be less than those reportedly requested
by the banks. Despite these actions, the Bank of Japan has announced that it pro-
jects that M-2 will grow at a 12 percent rate (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter --
roughly in line with increases recorded in recent quarters.

IV -14
The Japanese current account (s.a.) realized a deficit of nearly $200
million in June, and the cumulative current-account deficit for the first half of
1979 amounted to $360 million. This figure may be compared with surpluses of
$10.4 billion and $6.2 billion in the first and second halves, respectively, of
1978. (The first-half 1979 deficit includes about $1.2 billion in emergency
imports.) The recent rapid adjustment of the current account has been due in
large part to increases in the prices of Japanese imports, including a rise in
the price of imported oil of more than 35 percent since the fourth quarter of
1978. Price increases on the import side have been partly offset by renewed
strength in export volume which expanded sharply in May.
The German rate of unemployment in July remained unchanged from its
low May-June level of 3.7 percent (s.a.). Industrial production rose strongly
in May and the provisional June figure shows a further increase. A leading
source of strength has been the construction industry where capacity has become
increasingly strained. New orders and demand for credit remained at high levels.
The cost of living index continued to rise briskly through July and
has risen at an annual rate of nearly 8 percent this year. Import prices in June
were 13 percent above their June 1978 level and have risen at an annual rate of
28 percent during the first half of this year.
Monetary growth may have begun to slow in the face of the restrictive
posture of the Bundesbank, whose latest measures were increases in the discount
and Lombard rates from 4 to 5 and from 5-1/2 to 6 percent respectively on July 13.
Nevertheless, central bank money (CBM) has continued at the upper limit of the
Bundesbank's target range (6-9 percent CBM growth between the fourth quarters of
1978 and 1979). During the second quarter of 1979, CBM was slightly more than
10 percent above the second quarter of 1978 level.

IV -15
The trade surplus (n.s.a.) recorded a further decline in June and for
the first half of 1979 was $7.9 billion compared with $9.4 billion in the first
half of last year. The change in the current account was much more pronounced
because of increased service and transfers deficits this year. The current-
account surplus (n.s.a.) for the first half of this year was $0.3 billion, com-
pared with $3.8 billion in the first half of 1978.
Economic activity in Italy continues to be strong, despite a sharp drop
in industrial production in May, which was apparently related to strike activity.
Survey data indicate that orders are high and inventory levels still declining.
The deceleration of the monthly rates of consumer and wholesale price inflation i
June to 1.0 and 0.9 percent respectively (their lowest rates this year) is likely
to be transitory because seasonal factors were involved. Also, recently-signed
labor contracts are likely to have a significant upward effect on labor costs.
Although the January-May trade deficit was $700 million (customs basis,
s.a.) compared to a $200 million deficit for 1978 as a whole, it remains at a
level consistent with a sizeable current-account surplus. The increasing trade
deficit is largely the result of higher imports because of stronger activity,
while most of the impact of higher oil prices has yet to be felt.
There has been some tightening of monetary policy over the course of
the year in the face of increasing inflationary pressures. The credit ceilings
of the Bank of Italy for the period April-September 1979 permit a 5.2 percent
loan expansion, considerably less than the expected rate of inflation. The
effectiveness of the credit ceilings, however, may be lessened by increased
recourse to foreign borrowing, which is not subject to the credit limits.
From December until the end of June consumer price inflation in France
has been fairly steady at an annual rate of 11.3 percent. Industrial wholesale

IV -16
prices have increased at an annual rate of 17.6 percent over the past six months;
however, in June the rate slowed to 10 percent.
Three-month money market interest rates in France are currently about
10-3/4 percent after averaging just under 7 percent in April and 8.6 percent in
June. The increase in nominal interest rates may in part reflect higher inflation
expectations, but it may also indicate tighter money-supply conditions. The Bank
of France's M-2 growth target is still 11 percent for the year. From December to
April the annual rate of growth was 15 percent, so that a substantial retardation
will be required if the 11 percent figure is to be met.
In April a $1-1/3 billion government investment stimulus was announced,
mainly as an offset to oil price increases. Since then no new specific fiscal
policy measures have been announced. However, the government has indicated that
the 1980 budget would run a significant deficit. Measures to bolster construction
food processing, and energy supplies and conservation are planned.
In the United Kingdom, anticipation of the sharp increase in value-added
taxes announced in the June 12 budget led to a jump in consumer spending. In the
second quarter of 1979 real consumer spending increased 14.5 percent (s.a.a.r.)
according to preliminary data. The second-quarter figure for consumer spending
is 7 percent above the figure for the second quarter of 1978. The increase in
value-added taxes will begin to be reflected in the price data to be published in
August. It is estimated that these increases in indirect taxes will increase the
consumer price index by 3-4 percent at a time when U.K. inflation has already
begun to accelerate.
In the year of June 1979, sterling-denominated M-3 rose 12 percent, with
growth accelerating in the second half of the period. The monetary growth target

IV -17
announced in the June budget calls for sterling M-3 growth of 7-11 percent (s.a.a.r.)
during the 10-month period June 1979 to April 1980, which amounts to a target range
of about 8-1/2 -11-1/2 percent for the 12 months to April 1980. (The previous
target for this period was 8 -12 percent).
The growth rates (s.a.a.r.) of all monetary aggregates in Canada increased
in June, continuing an upward trend begun three months ago. M-1 was 9.3 percent
above its June 1978 level, thus approaching the upper limit of the Bank of Canada's
target band of 6 to 10 percent. New monetary growth targets are expected to be
announced within the next three months, with a repetition of last year's lowering
of the target band (by 1 percentage point) likely. Thus, the increase in the Bank
of Canada's bank rate from 11.25 to 11.75 percent effective July 23, in response
to the recent increase in the U.S. discount rate, was also consistent with domestic
monetary objectives.
The Swiss consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in July after a 1.4 per-
cent increase in June, with the deceleration more than accounted for by variations
in oil prices. Without the oil price increases, the government has estimated that
the year over year rise in consumer prices in July would have been about 1 percent,
instead of the actual 4.3 percent.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has adopted a moderately restrictive stance
in 1979, but has repeatedly emphasized that it will limit the rise in interest rates
and not attempt to offset the inflationary effect of the oil price increases. The
SNB has recently intervened to keep capital market interest rates from rising, and
money market rates leveled off in June and July.
The National Bank of Belgium continued to tighten monetary policy to
defend the Belgian franc, and the sharp rise in short-term interest rates since
April has begun to spill over into long-term rates. Interest rates in the Nether-
lands have also risen although to a lesser extent.

APPENDIX A*
1979 JULY REVISION OF NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS
The annual revision to the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) left the overall contour of economic activity in the 1976-78 period
essentially unchanged. 1/ The recovery which began in 1975 is now estimated
to have been a little stronger than originally thought. In addition, reflect-
ing the normal re-assessment of seasonal factors, the quarterly pattern of
changes in real gross national product is a bit smoother than originally
estimated and the slight dip in 1978 QI now has been eliminated (see Table I).
However, the composition of output growth is somewhat different than earlier
estimated, as output gains over the period now appear to be even more concen-
trated in the household sector (see Table II). Additionally, on the income
side of the NIPA, the revised estimates now indicate somewhat higher flows
of business and personal incomes and slightly larger total government
deficits; moreover, the estimates also imply a shift among the components
of gross saving with an upward revision to business saving and a downward
revision to personal saving.
Summary
Gross national product (GNP) in real terms is now estimated to
have risen somewhat more rapidly over the last three years. The upward
revision to real growth was smallest in 1976 and equal to about .4 per-
centage point in both 1977 and 1978. The quarterly changes in real GNP
were revised upward in eight of the thirteen quarters covered by the
revision with the largest single adjustment being 2.0 percentage points
in 1978 QI. The upward revisions to real GNP resulted mainly from stronger
readings of consumption, net exports and inventory accumulation; in
contrast, spending for business fixed investment and government purchases
was less than previously published. In current dollar terms, the level
of GNP was increased by $2 billion in 1976, by $12 billion in 1977 and
by a total of $20 billion in 1978. GNP prices were revised only fraction-
ally over this three year period.
Highlights of this revision by sector of activity are as follows:
1) Consumer spending was increased by sizable amounts in both
1977 and 1978 and by the end of the revision period personal
consumption was estimated to be $12 billion higher than earlier
indicated. The personal saving rate was reduced in both years
and in 1978 was almost 1/2 percentage point lower than the
earlier indication.
1/ This revision covers the period 1976 QI through 1979 QI. New source data
which were not available at the time of the earlier estimates are incor-
porated and seasonal factors are updated in the annual July revision.
* Prepared by James D. August, Economist, National Income Section, Division
of Research and Statistics.

2) The rate of inventory accumulation was revised upward by somewhat
over $6 billion in both 1977 and 1978; however, also reflecting
upward revisions in sales the constant dollar inventory/final
sales ratios were only little affected by the revision.
3) Purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
are now estimated to have been somewhat greater in 1976 and
almost $3 billion more in both 1977 and 1978. Federal
purchases were revised downward a bit in all three years.
4) Business fixed investment was revised very little in all three
years with changes occuring mainly in the structures component
of investment.
5) Net exports were revised upward in all three years with upward
revisions to exports more than offsetting downward or lesser
import adjustments.
6) On the income side of the accounts, there were upward revisions
to personal income in all three years -- reaching $9-1/2 billion
in 1978. Corporate profits were revised upward sharply in both
1977 and 1978.
Consumer Sector Activity
Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) were revised down a bit
in 1976 but upward by significant amounts in both 1977 and 1978. The
slight downward revision in 1976 was concentrated in expenditures on
services. In 1977 the upward revision was mainly in nondurable goods
whereas in 1978, the upward adjustment was largely in nondurable goods
and in services. By major expenditure category, there were large upward
revisions in all three years in consumer purchases of food; also, in
1977 and 1978 expenditures on housing services and clothing and shoes
were raised substantially over earlier estimates. Finally, purchases of
autos and "other" (nonfurniture) durable goods were revised up sharply in
1978 as was spending for "other" services (which includes medical care,
personal business, recreation and education).
Personal income was revised upward slightly in 1976 and 1977 and
by a larger amount ($9-1/2 billion) in 1978. (See Table III.) The large
revision for 1978 was centered in proprietors' income (mainly farm) and
rental and personal interest income; in contrast, there were downward
revisions in transfer payments and dividends. Because the upward revision
in PCE for 1978 was somewhat greater than that in disposable income the
personal saving rate was reduced by .4 percentage point to 4.9 percent
for the year as a whole. This rate is the lowest, on an annual basis,
since 1963 when it was 4.7 percent.

A-3
Business Sector Activity (See Table IV.)
Business spending on fixed capital goods was revised downward by
relatively small amounts ($1 to $1-1/2 billion) in 1977 and 1978, respectively.
In 1977 this scaling down was all in structures while in 1978 there was also
a slight reduction in producers' durable equipment purchases.
The revisions in nonfarm business inventory investment indicate
somewhat more accumulation in 1977 (+$5.7 billion) and 1978 (+$4.6 billion)
than indicated previously. Much of this upward revision appears to have
been in the manufacturing sector and appears to reflect incorporation of
data from the 1977 economic censuses. To a lesser extent this upward
revision in inventory investment also reflects downward revisions in the
inventory valuation adjustment. The quarterly pattern of changes in this
sector is essentially the same as earlier estimated except in 1978 QIV
and 1979 QI. Movements in the constant dollar nonfarm inventories/final
sales ratio were little affected, and since final sales were also
revised upward, the level of the ratio was raised only slightly; at .278
the 1979 QII level is still well below the 1974 QIV record high of .300.
Corporate profits were revised downward slightly in 1976 and
upward by substantial amounts in 1977 and 1978. (See Table III.) Economic
profits (those with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments)
are now reported as fractionally lower in 1976 and $5.8 billion and $8.2
billion higher in 1977 and 1978, respectively. The 1977 and 1978 revisions
were split between before tax (book) profits and the capital consumption
adjustment (the accounting adjustment that reconciles economic and tax
depreciation of capital assets). Corporate cash flow -- as measured by
undistributed corporate profits plus capital consumption allowances
(with both the inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) --
was revised upward in all three years; given the slight downward revisions
in capital outlays over this period, this implies a somewhat smaller
financing gap than previously indicated.
Other Private Activity
Residential construction outlays were little changed in 1976
and 1977 and were raised by $1 billion in 1978. Net exports were a bit
larger than earlier reported for all three years; exports were revised up
and imports down in both 1976 and 1977. In 1978 the upward revision in
imports was somewhat less than that in exports.
Government Activity
Federal expenditures were revised downward in all three years
with the major downward revision coming in purchases of durable goods
and services -- mainly defense in 1976 and 1977 and about half defense
and half nondefense in 1978; the earlier estimate of net interest outlays
was also reduced in 1978. Compensation of employees and grants-in-aid
to state and local governments were revised up in 1978. Receipts, at
the federal level, were revised upward in both 1977 and 1978 mainly
reflecting the higher estimates for personal income and corporate profits.
The federal deficit was revised downward by about $2 billion in both 1977
and 1978.

A-4
State and local government expenditures were revised upward
significantly in all three years with the bulk of the revisions being in
employee compensation, structures and net interest. Receipts were also
scaled up due to higher estimates of contributions for social insurance,
corporate profits and personal incomes. The size of the state and local
government surplus was reduced in all three years as downward revisions
in the "operating funds" surplus more than offset increases in the
estimate for social insurance funds balances.
On an NIPA basis, the net total balance for the government
sector (federal plus state and local) shows a slightly larger deficit
in 1976 and 1977; in 1978 the fiscal position of the sector as a whole
is now shown to be essentially in balance. This results from slightly
lower state and local surpluses as well as somewhat smaller federal
deficits. (See Table V.)
Prices
This revision had very little impact on movements of aggregate
prices as measured either by the implicit price deflator for GNP or by
the gross domestic business product (GDBP) fixed-weighted price index. 2/
(See Table VI.) The major change in the quarterly pattern of the GNP
deflator occurs in 1977 QIV and 1978 Q1 where the acceleration now is
estimated to occur somewhat earlier; most other quarterly revisions were
relatively small and left the basic pattern of inflation unchanged. The
major revisions in the quarterly pattern of changes in the GDBP fixed-
weighted index are the markedly smaller increases in all three second
quarters -- an adjustment that appears primarily due to new seasonal
factors.
Implications at Revised Seasonal Factors
Prior to this latest revision, real GNP growth over each of
the three years of the 1976-78 period was characterized by relatively
strong growth in the second and fourth quarters, and weaker growth in
the first and third quarters. While actual seasonal factors are not
yet available, it appears that this revision has smoothed considerably
the quarterly pattern of activity in each of the three years. Indeed,
on the revised basis there now appears to be no discernible intra-year
biases to the quarterly pattern of real GNP growth.
2/ Typically, revisions to aggregate price measures are small since there is
little new source data available after publication of monthly OPI & PPI
price indices; such revisions thus tend more to reflect seasonal adjustment.
