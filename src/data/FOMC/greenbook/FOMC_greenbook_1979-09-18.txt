The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent data suggest that, following the second quarter decline,
economic activity is showing little change on balance in the third quarter.
Both business fixed capital outlays and state and local government
spending rebounded from the effects of transitory factors that had damped
growth earlier. But the key underlying forces that have been depressing
activity still appear to be dominant. Employment growth has continued
to weaken, real wage and salary payments have declined further, consumer
demand in real terms has remained sluggish, and inflation has persisted
unabatedly. Moreover, an unintended rise in July inventories has added
a new element of instability in developments.
Employment and Production
Labor demand eased appreciably in August. Total employment,
as measured by the household survey, declined 310,000 to about the level
in March. As a result, the jobless rate rose 0.3 percentage point to
6.0 percent in August, with adult women and teenagers registering the
largest increases. Since the June low in the total unemployment rate,
jobless rates for experienced workers have risen about 1/3 percentage
point.
Nonfarm payroll employment was unchanged in August as declines
in manufacturing and construction were offset by increases in the service-
producing sector. Manufacturing employment fell nearly 125,000 (almost
80,000 after allowing for changes in workers on strike), with widespread
declines among producers of both durable and nondurable goods. The

factory workweek declined 0.2 hour to 40.0 hours in August. There is
also substantial evidence that employment dropped in the motor vehicle
industry, although the decline is not reflected in the August payroll
survey. Industry sources estimate that by early September layoffs
had reached a level of more than 80,000.
Industrial production is tentatively estimated to have declined
1 percent or somewhat more in August, following two months of little
change. Output of consumer goods declined sharply as auto assemblies
fell 15 percent to a 7.5 million unit annual rate and output of related
industries also dropped. The September schedule for auto assemblies
indicates a rise to an 8.1 million unit annual rate as manufacturers
increase production of 1980 models, but this is well below the 8.9
million unit rate that prevailed in the first half of the year. Produc-
tion of business equipment, which had held up fairly well earlier this
year, also dropped moderately, as did output of materials. The declines
in these sectors were widespread, most notably in production of business
vehicles, parts for consumer durable goods, and raw steel.
Reflecting the estimated drop in manufacturing output in August,
the rate of capacity utilization in that sector appears to have decreased
by about 1-1/4 percentage points to 84-3/4 percent. The manufacturing
utilization rate has fallen roughly 2-1/2 percentage points below the
March peak and is 3-1/4 percentage points below the 1973 high. The rate
of capacity utilization for industrial materials is estimated to have

II -4
eased by about 1 percentage point in August to 2-1/2 percentage points
below its recent peak level in December 1978 and about 6 percentage points
below its 1973 high.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Income growth improved somewhat in July, but in August payroll
employment was unchanged and the workweek edged down; consequently,
income gains probably were small. Personal income advanced at a 17
percent annual rate in July, but about 40 percent of the gain resulted
from the annual cost-of-living raises in Social Security and veterans'
benefits. Even excludingthose increases, personal income grew at a
slightly faster pace than in recent months. Nevertheless, in real terms,
total personal income was still 1-1/2 percent below its December 1978
high, as wage and salary income continued to decline in July.
Retail sales advanced 0.7 percent in August for the second
consecutive month. To some extent, the gain in sales was associated,
both directly and indirectly, with the improved availability of gasoline.
Increases were divided about evenly between sales of durables and non-
durables, as furniture and appliance stores and gasoline stations
registered relatively large advances. Excluding autos and nonconsumption
items, nominal retail sales rose almost 1 percent for the second month
in a row. In real terms, retail sales in August probably changed little
and were about 4 percent below the level of last December.

Total auto sales were at an 11.0 million unit annual rate in
August, up almost 1 million units from the depressed June-July sales
pace. Sales of domestic units surged to an 8.8 million unit annual rate--
the highest since March--as manufacturers' sales incentive programs
permitted substantial price reductions on overstocked large-model cars.
However, with the ending of the sales programs at General Motors and
Ford, demand for these models is likely to fall somewhat. Some of the
August strength in sales of domestic-model cars apparently was at the
expense of imports as sales of foreign cars--which for many makes were
in short supply--fell to a 2.2 million unit annual rate in August for the
slowest pace since January.
Measures of consumer attitudes in August continued to indicate
depressed levels of confidence. The Conference Board index of consumer
confidence--a monthly composite of five questions on both present and
expected economic conditions--declined further to its lowest level
since early 1975. The Michigan Survey Reseacch Center index of sentiment
increased slightly in August, but it too was close to its 1975 low.
Evaluations of market conditions for purchasing automobiles in the
Michigan survey improved somewhat as respondents reacted favorably to
automobile price discounts and the increased availability of fuel-
efficient models.

II -8
Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment spending rose in July as expenditures
on capital equipment recouped much of the loss in the spring that had
resulted from the strike- and fuel-related disruptions. Shipments of
nondefense capital goods rose 2.5 percent after a 0.6 percent decline in
the second quarter. In addition, sales of heavy-weight trucks advanced
sharply following three months of decline. Expenditures on private
nonresidential construction, however, increased only slightly.
Despite the strength of current outlays, indicators of near-term
capital spending commitments have continued to suggest that the pace of
outlays is not likely to be sustained. New orders for nondefense capital
goods fell 6.6 percent in July; since March these bookings have fallen
15 percent. While much of the weakness in July was due to a drop in
aircraft orders, new orders for the machinery component of nondefense
capital goods--more indicative of underlying short-run equipment demand--
fell 2 percent; these orders are 12 percent below the March peak. Con-
tracts awarded for nonresidential construction continued to be weak;
building contracts in July remained near the levels that prevailed in
the first half of the year.
Weakening prospects for fixed capital spending later this year
also are indicated by the latest Commerce Department survey of plant
and equipment expenditure plans for 1979. The survey, taken in late
July and early August, reported that businesses plan to increase capital
spending in 1979 by about 13 percent, 1/2 percent more than the rise

reported in the May survey. However, the upward revision reflected
primarily higher than expected spending in the second quarter of 1979,
and the survey results suggest a deceleration of spending growth from
a 12 percent annual rate over the first half of the year to a 7 percent
annual rate over the latter half. Capital appropriations of the 1000
largest manufacturers (net of cancellations) fell 6 percent in the second
quarter, following increases of nearly 20 percent in each of the pre-
ceding two quarters.
Inventory Investment
As in the case of fixed investment, recent data indicate an
acceleration in inventory investment in July. The book value of manu-
facturing and trade stocks increased at a record $94 billion annual rate,
almost twice the average pace over the first half of the year. However,
the extremely large rise in inventories was accompanied by a sizable
advance in total sales, and the ratio of manufacturing and trade stocks
to sales edged up only slightly to 1.44--still low on an historical
comparison. Retail trade inventories increased at an annual rate of $28
billion in July, the highest monthly rise on record. Stocking continued
at auto dealers where serious excesses have been observed. Nonetheless,
automobile production and sales data indicate that a correction undoubtedly
was underway in August. Wholesalers added to stocks at an annual rate
of $33.5 billion in July. Nearly a third of this increase was in stocks
of raw farm products and more than a fourth was in motor vehicles and
automotive supplies.

The book value of manufacturers' inventories increased at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $33 billion in July--somewhat less
than the $39 billion June rate, but about equal to the average for the
first half of the year. Even so, this rate of accumulation far exceeds
the gains throughout 1978. In July, stock building was fairly evenly
divided between producers of durable and nondurable goods, with large
increases at manufacturers of nonelectrical machinery, transportation
equipment (over half of which was at motor vehicle and parts producers),
and at manufacturers of food products.
Residential Construction
Housing activity has continued to hold up quite well in recent
months. Private housing starts were at a 1.8 million unit annual rate
in July--about the same as the average pace during the second quarter,
although well below the 1978 level. However, mortgage credit has become
more expensive and remains in relatively tight supply, while the stock
of unsold new units has remained at a relatively high level. These
developments suggest the likelihood of some near-term contraction in
production.
In the single-family sector, starts fell 6 percent in July but
have remained within a 1.2 -1.3 million unit rate range since March.
New home sales were up sharply in July--possibly reflecting improved
gasoline supplies--and sales of existing homes have continued brisk,
remaining about 5 percent below last year's record levels. Prices of
existing homes have continued to climb rapidly, with the July average
up about 18 percent from a year earlier.

Multifamily housing starts dropped by almost 10 percent in
July. However, this decline followed two months of quite strong activity,
and the July rate of starts was only marginally below last year's average
pace. The comparative strength in this sector reflects both continued
low rental vacancy rates and strong demand for condominium units.
Government Sector Activity
Treasury data for July and August now suggest that outlays are
falling short of agency spending plans for fiscal year 1979 and that the
actual deficit is likely to fall somewhat below the Administration's most
recent forecast of $30-1/2 billion. Shortfalls are apparently occurring
in programs for health care, unemployment compensation, the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, and farm product price supports (Commodity Credit
Corporation).. The shortfall in the latter category is indicated by
Department of Agriculture data that show a sharp rise in CCC loan repay-
ments (negative outlays in the budget accounts).
For fiscal year 1980, the Administration expects a $29 billion
deficit, with outlays and receipts of $543 and $514 billion, respectively.
While the Congress has not yet passed the Second Concurrent Resolution on
the 1980 budget, the Senate Budget Committee has recommended a $28 billion
deficit--essentially in line with the Administration's goal. (These deficit
estimates do not allow for a tax cut in 1980 and do not reflect the
Administration's recent decision to increase the pay raise for federal
employees to 7 percent from the previously intended 5.5 percent. The
pay raise is expected to add almost $0.8 billion to outlays in fiscal
year 1980.)

II -17
State and local government spending has rebounded somewhat
in recent months but remains on a moderate growth path. Capital out-
lays, as measured by the value of construction put-in-place, rose by
6 percent in July. Much of this gain was due to a surge in spending
for power projects, but spending for water supply facilities and housing
and redevelopment building also advanced from low levels of activity
in June. Despite the strong gain in July, construction spending in real
terms in July was still 7 percent below its year-earlier level. State
and local government payrolls increased by nearly 30,000 in August, in
line with the average gain so far this year.
Prices
Aggregate price measures continue to indicate rapid rates of
inflation in the third quarter. Producer prices of finished goods increased
at nearly a 14 percent annual rate in August, faster than the average over
the previous 7 months. In July, consumer prices increased at close to the
13 percent rate experienced earlier in this year.
Recent retail price movements continue to be dominated by develop-
ments in the energy sector. Increases for gasoline and fuel oil were in
the 5-6 percent range (not annual rate) in July, similar to the March-
June average. Gas and electricity rates also rose substantially, though
less than in May or June. From last December through July, prices of
energy items have climbed at an annual rate of over 45 percent, compared
with 8 percent during 1978. Given their relative importance in the CPI--
about 8-1/2 percent of the total--this acceleration has contributed about

II -18
3 of the 4.1 percentage point acceleration in the rate of CPI increase
so far this year. Producer prices in August at all stages of processing
reflected the continued sharp climb in the energy component.
In contrast to energy, rates of increase in food prices at the
consumer level slowed to about a 2 percent annual rate in June and July
as prices for meats and poultry declined. However, producer prices of
finished foods turned up in August with particularly large increases
for fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals, and bakery products; this
probably portends higher prices at retail later this year.
Outside the food and energy areas, the pace of inflation for
consumers was again rapid in July, though somewhat below that in recent
months. Homeownership costs continued to rise at close to the 17 per-
cent annual rate that prevailed in the first half of the year. This
component, affected mainly by house prices and mortgage interest rates,
accounts for most of the remaining acceleration in the CPI this year.
Among other items, large increases were registered for new cars and rents,
partially offset by further declines for used cars and apparel.
At the producer level prices of finished goods excluding food
and energy items rose at about a 7 percent annual rate in August, below
the average earlier this year. Prices declined for trucks and passenger
cars, reflecting the rebate and incentive programs in effect in mid-
August. Partly as a result of these declines, prices of capital equip-
ment edged up only 0.1 percent, the smallest monthly rise in more than
6 years. Prices of intermediate materials excluding food and energy
rose sharply, but at a slower pace than in July.

Wages and Collective Bargaining
Wage rates for nonfarm production workers, as measured by the
index of average hourly earnings, rose only slightly in August but remain
about 7-3/4 percent above a year ago. During the past year, wage increases
have accelerated somewhat for workers in manufacturing while moderating
in other sectors. More detailed data concerning changes in wage and
salary rates from the Employment Cost Index, which covers a broader group
of nonfarm workers, suggest that the acceleration in factory wages has
occurred almost wholly among unionized workers. This trend reflects the
importance of 1979's heavy collective bargaining schedule on wage
developments this year.
In the first two quarters of the year, almost 2 million workers
negotiated new agreements, and contracts for another 1.3 million will
expire in the current quarter. About half of those bargaining this quarter
are covered by contracts between the United Auto Workers (UAW) and major
auto producers. To date, the union has rejected the initial offer by
General Motors (GM), the strike target. If no agreement is reached by
September 14, the UAW may call a strike against GM, which employs about
400,000 of the 655,000 UAW members. Union leaders have indicated that any
strike would likely be selective, affecting about one quarter of the
GM work force. The company, however, could respond with a lockout.
The initial GM offer came close to union demands for increases in
pensions for early retirees and for a raise in the number of paid personal
holidays. Important differences remain concerning union demands for an
improved cost-of-living formula for current workers and for a cost of
living adjustment for pension payments.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Against a backdrop of strong monetary expansion, rapid inflation,
and continued vulnerability of the dollar abroad, the System has tightened
money market conditions further since the August FOMC meeting. The federal
funds rate has risen into the 11-3/8 percent area from about 10-3/4 percent,
and the discount rate has been increased one-half percentage point to 10-1/2
percent. These developments, in combination with incoming economic data,
have raised substantially the level of interest rates expected by market
participants to prevail in the months ahead. As a consequence, yields on
most short-term market instruments have increased a percentage point or more
since mid-August, reaching new cyclical highs. Long-term bond rates also
have increased, albeit remaining a bit below their spring peaks, and home
mortgage rates in the primary market have edged to record levels.
Private commentary indicates some concern that the recent firming
of rates may signal the prospect of more stringent conditions of credit avail-
ability in coming months. To date, however, aggregate credit flows have been
well maintained, owing partly to the market innovations and regulatory changes
that thus far have obviated the abrupt supply curtailments seen in past cycles.
Business borrowing has continued sizable, especially in short- and interme-
diate-term markets, and state and local government debt issuance has remained
heavy, buoyed by sales of mortgage revenue bonds. The Treasury has raised a
considerable amount of new money since mid-August, in anticipation of its
substantial fourth quarter cash needs. Only household borrowing has declined
noticeably in recent months, largely reflecting a reduction in installment
credit growth associated with weak consumer spending.

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M-1 increased in August at a 7-1/2 percent annual rate, off from
the 10-3/4 percent average pace of the preceding four months, but still faster
than the FOMC's longer-range growth objective. Growth in demand deposits slowed
considerably, but this was partly offset by a surge in currency to nearly
double the average rate of expansion earlier this year. The retarding effect
of ATS and New York NOW accounts on the growth of M-1 continued to wane during
the month; shifts into these deposits reduced M-1 expansion by only one-half
percentage point in August, according to staff estimates.
M-2 growth also remained strong in August at 11-1/4 percent, only
slightly below the rapid pace of the preceding two months. Despite the further
rise in market interest rates, savings deposits expanded for the third consec-
utive month, although at a slower rate than in July. Growth of small time
deposits matched the July pace, suggesting that money market certificates
remained an important source of funds. The large-time deposit component of
M-2 also increased at about the same rate as in July.
Deposit growth at nonbank thrift institutions is estimated to have
slowed somewhat on a monthly average basis in August, although there was a
pickup at S&Ls and MSBs on an end-of-month basis. Partial data indicate that
sales of MMCs at S&Ls dropped back to June levels after a mild increase in
July.1 Credit unions have experienced a sharp increase in deposit growth
1/ In recent months deposit growth at S&Ls has been boosted by their increased
issuance of large CDs. During the three months ending in July, net sales of
large CDs by S&Ls averaged $1.2 billion and accounted for 3 percentage points
of overall S&L deposit growth--3 times the contribution to growth during the
first four months of the year. In addition to large CDs, S&Ls in the past few
months have apparently turned increasingly to such alternative sources of funds
as RPs, commercial paper, and mortgage-backed securities. Borrowing from Home
Loan Banks, on a seasonally adjusted basis, has been somewhat less in recent
months than in the first four months of 1979.

since June, apparently reflecting the introduction of new floating-ceiling
time accounts. The ceiling rate permitted on these accounts is the greater of
7-3/4 percent or 100 basis points below the 4-year average constant maturity
yield computed by the Treasury; maturities may range from 90 days to six years.
The flow of funds into short-term nondeposit investments remained
strong last month. Assets of money market mutual funds increased about $2.5
billion, close to the average pace for the first half of 1979, though less
than the record monthly increase of $4.2 billion in July. There was also
renewed activity in short-term unit investment trusts and a pickup in noncom-
petitive tenders in Treasury bill auctions.
Preliminary estimates indicate that total loans and investments at
commercial banks grew at a 10 percent annual rate in August, moderately below
the strong July rate.1 Business lending slowed somewhat during August, but
remained about in line with the second quarter pace. Growth of real estate
loans increased for the third consecutive month, while security loans outstand-
ing fell. Holdings of U.S. government securities declined, in contrast to
the increases in the preceding six months.
To finance their lending activities in August, banks relied heavily
on managed liabilities to supplement the $7 billion inflow of deposits subject
to rate ceilings. Large-denomination time deposits increased $2.2 billion
for the month, while a new series for net balances due to directly related

rate, compared to the 14 percent rate for the old series. The revision will
be discussed in the Greenbook Supplement.

foreign institutions indicates that these balances rose by an estimated
$3.6 billion, after a $1.6 billion advance in July.1 Domestic nondeposit
funds in August approximately doubled their July increase as well.
Business Finance
Aggregate business borrowing has remained large in recent months,
with continued relatively heavy reliance on short- and intermediate-term
financing rather than on longer-term bond offerings. Banks have remained a
major focus of business credit demands, and both large and small institutions
reported strong growth of commercial and industrial loans in August. In
informal contacts, officials of a number of large banks have indicated that a
good deal of the recent loan growth has been associated with the financing of
inventories and accounts receivable. Some bankers also cited diminished cor-
porate liquidity as a reason for strong external financing demands.
According to the quarterly survey of lending officers at large
banks, a substantial proportion of respondents perceived business loan demand
to have strengthened in the three months ending August 15.2 In addition,
many bankers predicted greater loan demand during the next three months. In
this environment, respondent banks, on balance, established firmer standards
of creditworthiness and reduced their willingness to extend fixed rate credit,
particularly for long-term loans. Since mid-August the prime rate has been
raised 3/4 percentage point to a record 12-3/4 percent, as banks have responded
to sharply increasing market yields.

Supplement.

III-8
Commercial paper issuance by nonfinancial companies totaled $1.4
billion in August (monthly average basis), approaching the near-record pace
of July. Dealers reported that firms, in addition to financing involuntary
inventory accumulation, were borrowing well ahead of September tax and divi-
dend dates in order to beat possible rate increases. While net issuance of
finance company paper fell off markedly because of the paydown of Chrysler
Financial obligations, net sales of bank-related paper continued strong.1
Quality spreads widened slightly over the month; however, dealers attributed
this to competition from other short-term investments rather than to risk
considerations, per se, and noted that such a development is common during
periods when market rates generally are rising rapidly.
Over the first seven months of 1979, the substantial growth in
nonfinancial commercial paper and business loans at both commercial banks
and finance companies was accompanied by an increase of about $3-1/2 billion
in bankers acceptances held by investors other than commercial banks. (Bank
holdings of acceptances, which are included in business loans, increased by
$1-1/2 billion.) Acceptances represent for many businesses an alternative
source of short-term financing at a cost below the commercial bank prime
rate. The gain in acceptances issued this year primarily reflects increased
use of these bills to finance U.S. exports, imports, and third-country trade.
Several large member banks appear to be reaching their limits on acceptance
1/ Finance company business loans expanded rapidly in July (the most recent
month for which data are available). A large increase in wholesale auto
loans, which generally finance car dealer inventories, accounted for the
major share of the overall $1.5 billion gain.

issuance, defined as 100 percent of capital and surplus. Nevertheless, this
probably will not by itself constrain further growth of acceptances, as many
other large members have not reached their legal limits and many large non-
member issuers--including agencies of foreign banks--are not subject to such
legal limits.
Gross public offerings of corporate bonds increased somewhat in
August on a seasonally adjusted basis. Offerings by nonfinancial corporations
rose from the unusually low July total, but remained relatively light at $1.25
billion (not seasonally adjusted). Public offerings of bonds by financial
corporations decreased in August. Although mortgage-backed bond issues by
thrift institutions increased, longer-term debt financings by bank holding
companies were minimal, and offerings by finance companies moderated somewhat.
Takedowns of privately placed corporate bonds--a principal source
of long-term debt financing for smaller and lower-rated industrial firms--are
estimated to have been somewhat below 1978's strong pace thus far this year;
moreover, bond commitments outstanding at life insurance companies--the major
investors in privately placed bonds--recently reached their lowest level in
four years (see chart on page III-11). However, life insurers have provided
nonfinancial companies with an increased amount of long-term credit through
nonresidential mortgages, and their volume of such commitments outstanding
was at a record level at midyear. Although policy loan demand at life insur-
ance companies has strengthened considerably this year, it has not bulked
as large relative to total investable funds as in past periods of high market
interest rates. The higher loan rates specified in policies in recent years
and the fact that many low-rate loans taken out earlier were never repaid

have helped to restrain policy loan growth. The resulting absence of cash
flow pressure at life insurers has been one factor contributing to the
sustained availability of long-term funds to lower-rated firms and to the
maintenance of narrow risk premiums among bond quality categories.
Stock prices have changed little on balance since the last FOMC
meeting in the face of negative economic news and the upward movement in
interest rates. Despite some decline most recently, the AMEX and NASDAQ
composite indexes remain near record highs, while most major indexes of NYSE-
listed securities are near their highest levels since early 1973.1 This
relative strength reportedly reflects the view that the expected recession
will be relatively mild and could set the stage for more sustainable, less
inflationary growth in the longer run. The August rally in stock prices was
accompanied by the largest seasonally adjusted volume of stock offerings in
almost a year. Although public utilities continued to account for a majority
of common and preferred stock offerings, several larger industrial concerns
also had new equity issues.
Government Debt Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting, the Treasury has raised more than $5
billion in new money, with $2 billion of this sum in the form of cash manage-
ment bills that were sold to bridge the tax date and are due to mature later
this month. However, the remainder of the borrowing was undertaken in antici-
pation of large fourth quarter needs, which include the financing of a sizable

budget deficit. $2.5 billion of 4-year, 8-month notes were sold in late
August, and $200 million of new money has been raised in each of the regular
weekly bill auctions since mid-August. The volume of 3- and 6-month bills
outstanding had been permitted to decline by $2.5 billion over the earlier
months of the year. The System's Open Market Account acquired a substantial
volume of Treasury bills in late August and early September, purchasing about
$1.3 billion from foreign official institutions.
The three major federally sponsored credit agencies are estimated
to have reduced outstanding debt by about $150 million in August, on a season-
ally adjusted offerings basis. The Farm Credit Banks have raised an estimated
$550 million, in line with the monthly average so far in 1979, while the
Federal Home Loan Banks raised only $300 million and the Federal National
Mortgage Association reduced its outstanding debt by close to $1 billion. The
contraction in FNMA debt probably reflected low anticipated financing needs,
but these are likely to be revised upward in view of recent market develop-
ments, such as the sharply increased activity in the biweekly FNMA commitment
auctions.
Gross offerings of state and local government bonds increased to
about $4.0 billion in August, seasonally adjusted, from $3.4 billion during
the previous month. The increase was due to a larger volume of bonds issued
for new capital purposes, with housing-related revenue bonds representing
one-third of the total. Nearly 90 percent of the housing bonds issued during
August were for single-family mortgage programs. These bonds were part of
the estimated $3.2 billion of mortgage revenue bonds that were postponed
earlier this year when legislation was introduced to curtail home mortgage

III-15
financing by local borrowing authorities. Although the Congress has yet to
act, issuers responded to indications that the final legislation will exempt
the formerly postponed issues from any new restrictions.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage market conditions have continued to tighten in recent weeks.
Field reports suggest that higher mortgage rates have deterred some borrowers,
although the volume of mortgage lending apparently has been well maintained
thus far.
Mortgage commitments outstanding at S&Ls changed little in July,
but remained quite large relative to cash flows from deposits and loan repay-
ments.1 Deepening discounts on FHA/VA home mortgages bearing the current 10
percent interest rate ceiling apparently have hampered lending in this sector
of the market, and the rising cost of short-term warehousing credit may be
constraining loan originations by mortgage companies. On the other hand,
the relatively high yields prevailing on conventional loans apparently have
continued to encourage diversified institutions to invest more heavily in
residential mortgages; total real estate lending at commercial banks picked
up further in August, and residential mortgage commitments outstanding at
life insurance companies were at a record level at midyear (latest data
available). Also, state and local government mortgage revenue bond programs,
offering below-market interest rates to qualified borrowers, have accounted
for considerable origination activity in some localities.
1/ S&L mortgage lending activity continues to vary widely by geographic
area, with commitment activity weakest in the Midwest and strongest in areas
of the South and the far West.

III-16
Average interest rates on new commitments for 80 percent 30-year
conventional home loans at sampled S&Ls have risen somewhat in recent weeks
to a record 11.20 percent after more than a month of stability. Meanwhile,
the proportion of these institutions reporting funds in short supply has crept
back up to around 80 percent following a slight improvement during July. In
the West, average rates have returned to 11-3/4 percent following a reduction
to 11-1/2 percent during mid-summer, and several large associations in Califor-
nia have gone to 12 percent.1 In national secondary mortgage markets, yields
on GNMA-guaranteed securities and in the FNMA commitment auctions have moved
up sharply since the last FOMC meeting, and the volume of offerings to FNMA
has risen substantially, reflecting heightened concern among mortgage bankers
about the possibility of future rate increases.
State usury ceilings have continued to constrain conventional home
mortgage lending to some degree despite recent adjustments. Since late last
year about a dozen states have eliminated binding ceilings or have tied maxi-
mum rates to indexes of various market yields. Nevertheless, New York and New
Jersey, along with four smaller states, still have ceilings fixed or capped
below 11 percent. Moreover, the unusually wide spreads between conventional
mortgage rates and intermediate- and long-term Treasury yields have caused
1/ Variable-rate home mortgages continue to be originated at the same
interest rates as conventional fixed-rate home mortgages at most major S&Ls
and commercial banks in California. Rate increases on many outstanding
variable-rate mortgages appear to be in store, as the cost-of-funds index
used semiannually by banks and state-chartered thrift institutions in that
state to adjust rates on outstanding VRMs was 61 basis points higher in
August than six months earlier. Actual adjustments to rates on outstanding
VRMs are subject to a number of limitations; in particular, increases may
not exceed 25 basis points in any semiannual period.

states, including Illinois and Texas.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at a 10 percent annual
rate in July, about the same as the downward revised June figure. This repre-
sents a substantial moderation from the 15 percent rate of advance earlier, and
the nearly 19 percent growth in the latter half of 1978. A further decline
in net lending on automobiles and a sharp deceleration in expansion of bank
revolving credit contributed to the slow growth in July.
Commercial banks accounted for an unusually low share (one-fourth)
of the total net installment credit advanced to consumers during July. This
contraction of bank participation is consistent with the mid-August Survey of
Senior Bank Loan Officer Opinion, which indicated that the attitude of sample
banks toward extensions of consumer installment credit to individuals continued
to become slightly less accommodating. Finance rates on commercial bank con-
sumer installment loans generally continued to rise through August, reaching
a level 10 to 30 basis points higher than six months earlier.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. For most of the period since the last

currencies fluctuated in a narrow range. The chart depicting the weighted-
average value of the dollar shows this pattern
Just before Labor Day, however, an increase in the volume of foreign official
dollar sales brought the dollar's value under downward pressure, which
continued into early September and was resisted by increased U.S. intervention
purchases of dollars.
In the early part of the review period, market participants took
favorable note of U.S. moves to tighten financial conditions, including
increases in both the discount and federal funds rates. More recently,
however, attention has shifted to German moves increase the restrictiveness
of monetary policy. German short-term interest rates have risen almost
100 basis points over the review period. The mark has, consequently, come
into strong demand against currencies of other European countries, where
comparable tightening has not been apparent. The mark has also been under
upward pressure against the dollar, although the increase in U.S. short-term
interest rates since August 8 has at least matched that in German rates.

In contrast to the mark, the yen has been under downward pressure
against the dollar for much of the review period. Japan's trade and current-
account surpluses have diminished at a very fast rate this year, and the
country has been the target of a number of actual or rumored cut-backs in
oil supplies from major producers.
Over the entire period since August 8, the price of gold has risen
15-to-20 percent, not only in terms of the dollar but also against all
other major currencies. That the increase in the gold price has been fairly
uniform from currency to currency is evidence of market participants'
concern about prospects for rising inflation rates in many industrialized
countries.
U.S. authorities bought about $100 million against marks.

During the last week of August and the first week and a half of September,
U.S. authorities' intervention support for the dollar was
in the form of net mark sales of nearly $1 billion equivalent, split about
equally between Treasury and System accounts.

U.S. bank lending abroad. In the first half of 1979, the
growth of U.S. banks' external claims, particularly on countries other
than international financial centers, gave further evidence of a slow-
ing trend apparent since 1977. In part, the deceleration in U.S. bank
lending in the first half of 1979 reflects some slowing in the pace of
gross medium and long term borrowing in international capital markets
from all banks this year. In addition, the slowdown in U.S. bank lend-
ing reflects a sluggish underlying trend resulting from the strong
growth in U.S. domestic credit demands and increased competition from
banks in Western Europe and Japan, where loan demand in domestic credit
markets over the past two years have been weaker than in the United
States as a result of more restrained rates of economic growth. The
increasingly intense competition has been reflected in a rapid decline
in interest spreads on international loans since the beginning of 1978,
and has discouraged U.S. banks from participating in a number of syndi-
cated Eurocurrency credits with exceptionally low spreads relative to
perceived risks. However, some U.S. banks reportedly have reassessed
their behavior and recently have begun to manage credits at low spreads
that previously had been avoided.
U.S. bank claims on countries other than international
financial centers increased by only $2.9 billion in the first half of
this year, or less than one third of the increase in the last half of
1978. This increase was concentrated in the non-oil developing coun-
tries, and was spread among a relatively large number of individual
countries. Particularly significant increases were registered by Korea,

the Philippines and Argentina. The further drop in interest spreads,
to their lowest levels in five years, may have encouraged non-oil
developing countries to maintain their pace of borrowing from interna-
tional banks and in some cases this borrowing has been added to already
substantial levels of reserves.
In contrast, U.S. bank claims on Eastern Europe, oil-exporting
countries, and smaller developed countries have experienced absolute
declines since the end of 1978. Especially notable were the declines in
claims on the U.S.S.R., Middle Eastern oil-exporting countries, South
Africa, and Spain. U.S. bank claims on the latter two countries have
been declining since mid-1978.
Claims on international financial centers (G-10 countries,
Switzerland, and offshore banking centers) increased by $4.6 billion in
the first six months of this year, about two-fifths the increase in the
last half of 1978. As was true in 1978, claims on the international
financial centers continued to expand faster than other claims, reflec-
ting to a large extent the large volume of interbank money market
activity conducted by banking offices in these countries.

U.S. International Transactions. The U.S. merchandise trade
deficit in July was $17.4 billion at an annual rate (international accounts
basis), about half the size of the June deficit and also substantially
lower than the first or second quarter averages.
Exports in July continued the strong rise of the previous
several months. Much of the recent increase was in agricultural exports,
which reached a record $38.7 billion annual rate in July. Poor crops in
the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe have resulted in increased U.S. shipments
of wheat and corn to the U.S.S.R. and have contributed to higher agricultural
export prices. U.S. agricultural exports are expected to remain high
through next spring.
Nonagricultural exports in July continued the steady rise that
began early last year; about half of the increase in value so far this
year is attributable to rising prices. Much of this years' export growth
was in industrial supplies, particularly nonferrous metals and chemicals.

Machinery exports rose more gradually, by less than 10 per cent from
December to July. Civilian aircraft exports have been fairly strong
since last fall, but in July export deliveries nearly doubled the June rate.
The value of oil imports rose sharply in July reaching $61.1
billion at an annual rate. All of the increase from June was in price;
imported oil averaged $19.45 per barrel in July compared with $17.57
per barrel in June and an average of $16.31 per barrel in the second
quarter. These import unit values already reflect about 75 per cent of
the increase in price expected this year. The volume of imported oil
declined slightly in July to 8.4 million barrels per day compared with
an average for both June and the second quarter of 8.7 million barrels
per day. Despite this reduction in the volume of imports, U.S. petroleum
stocks of crude and refined products continued to increase in July, as
they have since the end of March. Stocks are now above the level of a
year ago.
Non-oil imports declined sharply in July from the June rate and
also from the second-quarter rate. The decline was spread over most major
commodity categories, particularly industrial supplies, capital goods, and
foreign cars. Even before July, the volume of non-oil imports had
stopped growing -- the volumes in the first and second quarters were
little changed from import levels in late 1978. This reduction in the
growth of import volume was probably due to the continuing impact of
earlier exchange rate changes, and to the slowdown in U.S.
economic activity. Non-oil import prices, however, have risen sharply

this year, 9 per cent from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the second
quarter of 1979.
Despite the improvement in the trade balance, the pressure on
the dollar in exchange markets continued in July. The reserve holdings
of the G-10 countries and Switzerland in the United States increased
(net) by $3.5 billion.
In
addition, the United States sold about $1.2 billion equivalent of DM
out of Treasury balances in support of the dollar.
OPEC holdings of U.S. securities and bank liabilities rose
by $900 million in July. In August (through the 29th) OPEC holdings
at the FRBNY alone rose by more than $1 billion, largely in Treasury
bills. This increase in OPEC assets probably reflected higher receipts
due to the increase in petroleum prices and the shortening of the time
period between shipment and payment granted to oil companies.
In contrast to these official net inflows, bank-reported
private capital transactions showed a net private capital outflow of
$1.8 billion in July. This net outflow was associated with a surge in

loans to nonbank borrowers in Latin American ($1.1 billion) and Japan
($500 million). Also the World Bank shifted holdings from money-market
placementswith U.S. banks toward Treasury bills. This produced com-
pensating movements in bank-reported flows and foreign net purchases
of U.S. Treasury securities. The June and July bank-reported net out-
flows contrasted with net inflows of $22 billion reported for the first
five months of the year.
Although banks reported a net private capital outflow overall
in July, the head offices of member banks did borrow some additional funds
from their own foreign branches. At the same time, these foreign branches
have continued to receive additional deposits from U.S. non-bank residents*/
In the first seven months of 1979, borrowing from own branches increased
approximately $17 billion, while U.S. residents' deposits in these
branches increased between $11 billion.and $13 billion. This range
reflects uncertainty about whether Euro-CD purchases by money market
mutual funds are reported as part of U.S. residents' deposits. In
August, the head offices of member banks raised an additional $2.6 billion
**/through their foreign branches.
*/ These deposits are not included in the net private capital outflow
reported by U.S. banks.

in August.

Foreign Economic Developments. Recent data indicate that
economic activity in Japan and Germany was strong in the second
quarter. Japanese GNP increased at an annual rate of more than
6-1/2 percent in the first half year. German figures confirm under-
lying strength that was distorted in the first quarter due to in-
dustrial disputes and weather. British data indicate a recovery from
the strike-depressed activity levels prevailing in the first quarter.
French activity was weak in the first quarter and shows little
improvement in the second quarter. In Italy second-quarter activity
was weak, but industrial disputes distort the underlying picture.
Canadian real GNP declined 2.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter.
In several countries sharp price rises, often related to oil
or special factors, have served to exphasize the continuing inflation.
The new value added tax in the United Kingdom was largely responsible
for an increase in the retail price level of. over 4 percent in July.
In response to inflation and excessive monetary growth rates, interest
rates continue to increase. Germany has moved to restrain credit, and
Canada and France have increased interest rates in the past month.
However, France announced, in early September, a moderate fiscal stim-
ulus.
Second quarter trade-account surpluses (s.a.) were smaller and
deficits were larger than the 1978 quarterly average for all G-10
countries where data is available. The same is true for first quarter
current accounts. Germany's current-account surplus (s.a.) for the

IV-16
first quarter was $825 million below the 1978 quarterly average.
Japan ran a current-account deficit in the first half-year at a rate
of $0.8 billion (s.a.a.r.). This compares with a surplus of $16.5
billion in 1978. The six major countries had a combined trade surplus
(s.a.) of only $6.7 billion for the first half of 1979 compared with
$24.4 billion for the equivalent period last year. Simple calculations,
assuming constant oil import volume, indicate that about $6 billion of
the $18 billion swing was absorbed by higher oil bills; of course only
a small part of this year's oil price rise was reflected in first-half
trade data. Another fraction of the swing was a counterpart of the
$3.5 billion improvement in the U.S. deficit over the same period. The
remaining fraction reflects a variety of factors.
Individual Country Notes. Japanese real GNP increased 6 per-
cent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter following a 7 percent first-quarter
increase. Private plant, equipment, and consumption expenditure were
the primary sources of strength. The mid-August Tokyo consumer price
index dropped by 1-1/4 percent; the decline is somewhat less (about
1/2 point) when seasonal factors are excluded. Any optimism derived
from this decline must be tempered by the 20 percent annual rate of
wholesale price advance in June-August (compared with the previous
three months). Both bank lending and money stock growth slowed in
recent months. Short term interest rates moved upward, in the wake of
the July discount rate increase, until mid-August. They have remained
flat since then.

IV-20
The Japanese current account registered a $1-1/4 billion
deficit in July, and it is in cumulative deficit by about $1-3/4
billion for the first seven months of the year. Terms-of-trade losses
account for much of the recent current-account reversal. For the three
months ending in July, the dollar based unit value index for imports
increased at an annual rate greater than 35 percent; dollar based export
unit values were nearly unchanged over the same period.
Industrial production was strong in Germany during the second
quarter and through July. Apart from some signs of weakening demand for
large automobiles, the strength pervades all sectors. Although the
August consumer price index was only 0.1 percent above the July figure,
prices are now five percent higher than one year ago.
In August, the Bundesbank attempted to strengthen its control
of monetary aggregates by reducing lombard credit abuses. Henceforth,
each bank's average monthly indebtedness is not to exceed 15 percent of
its discount quota. When the measure becomes fully effective it will
reduce lombard credit by about half (DM4 billion) of its August level.
The current-account deficit (n.s.a.) of Germany in January-
July was $0.8 billion compared with a surplus of $3.2 billion for the
same seven months last year. About two-thirds of the current-account
change was in the trade account. Large terms-of-trade changes against
Germany, due to exchange-rate developments early in the year and higher
oil prices later, were responsible for a major part of the deterioration.
Tourism and interest payment expenditure accounted for the rest of the
current-account reversal.

IV-21
In the United Kingdom, preliminary data indicate that real
GDP rose strongly in the second quarter of 1979, although much of the
3 percent increase (quarterly rate) between the first and second
quarters simply reflects recovery from the effects of the first quarter's
industrial disputes. Industrial production has also recovered from its
first-quarter level and in June the index was some 4-1/2 percent above
the level prevailing 12 months earlier. The unemployment rate has been
declining for most of 1979, and in August it stood at 5.2 percent, the
lowest rate since early 1976. Nevertheless, there are signs that the
expected downturn in the U.K. economy may be starting: notified job
vacancies (s.a.) have started declining, and the latest survey data indi-
cate a weakening in orders, especially export orders.
Various labor disputes have made interpretation of the U.K.'s
current-account data for 1979 difficult. Data roughly adjusted by the
U.K. government indicate that for the first 7 months of the year, the
current account was in deficit by about $4-1/2 billion. During July the
current account showed a surplus of about $200 million. The data for
this year represent a pronounced weakening in external performance
compared to that in 1978. Special factors such as the truckdrivers'
strike in the first quarter and losses of exports to Iran and Nigeria
account for some of the decrease in the current-account balance. How-
ever, so far in 1979 there has been also a substantial increase in
imports in both value and volume terms. Increases in North Sea oil pro-
duction have continued to contribute positively to the U.K.'s external
performance.

IV-22
Italian industrial production fell by a total of 7-1/2 percent
in May and June. Since widespread strikes account for a substantial
part of the fall, it is too early to tell whether the upswing that began
in the last quarter of 1978 is now flattening out.
The trade account reflects the earlier strength of the Italian
economy. Strong import growth largely accounts for the higher deficit;
exports have been maintained at the high levels of last year. The
customs basis trade deficit grew from $300 million (s.a.) in the second
half of 1978 to $1 billion in the first half of this year. The current
account is probably still in substantial surplus, although at less than
the $6 billion rate of last year. The current account is sustained by
tourism, which is expected to increase significantly again this year, and
by growing emigrant remittances.
GDP growth in France for the first quarter was only 1.7 percent
(a.r.). Although second-quarter figures are not available, little, if any,
improvement is expected. Unemployment continues to increase.
In early September a fiscal stimulus, in the form of increased
transfers, public works, and construction aid, totalling slightly over
$1 billion was announced. The new 1980 budget foresees a $7 billion
deficit, which is twice the original 1979 budget deficit planned but
somewhat less than the 1979 deficit now anticipated.
For the first six months M2 growth was nearly 15 percent
(s.a.a.r.). If the 11 percent target is to be attained, growth in M2
for the remainder of this year will have to be at less than half the

IV-23
rate achieved in the first semester. The Bank of France raised the rate
at which it makes open market purchases by 3/4 percent this week.
Although the motivation for the increase was primarily to stabilize the
franc, the increase should contribute to slower monetary growth. A
target of 11 percent M2 growth is to be repeated for 1980.
The French current account turned around by $7 billion in 1978,
recording a $3.8 billion surplus. After six surplus quarters the trade
account was in deficit in the second quarter. Although volume movements
worked against France in the first quarter they were partially offset by
terms-of-trade gains. The increase in the price of oil and a U.S. slow-
down will both work against France for the rest of the year.
Real GNP in Canada fell 2.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second
quarter after increasing 7.1 percent in the first quarter. In addition,
to a fall in export volume, a slowdown in inventory accumulation and
business investment and moderation in personal expenditure led to the
decline.
The Canadian current-account deficit for the first quarter was
$5.7 billion (s.a.a.r.) compared with $4.6 billion for the whole of 1978.
The merchandise trade surplus for the first semester was $1.4 billion
(s.a.a.r.) compared with $3 billion for all of last year. Export volume
fell 5.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter; decreased automobile
exports were a major factor.
The Bank of Canada raised the bank rate, effective September 10,
to 12-1/4 percent from 11-3/4 percent, where it has been since July 23.

APPENDIX A*
THE SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES
Forty-three percent of the 121 respondents to the mid-August
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported
a strengthening in the demand for business loans from three months
earlier, somewhat below the proportion that had reported greater strength
in the previous survey. As in the previous survey, only a handful of
banks reported that loan demand had eased. Looking to the future, about
one-third of responding banks expected loan demand to strengthen, with a
large proportion of the banks that experienced strengthening in the three
months ending in mid-August expecting loan demand to remain essentially
unchanged in the next three months.
At the time of the survey the prime rate had just been raised by
1/4 percentage point to 11-3/4 percent, reversing a like decline earlier
in the survey period; however, it remained under upward pressure as rates
on CDs and on alternative forms of short-term credit continued to increase
rapidly, and it rose another 1/4 percentage point immediately after the
survey. As in the mid-May survey, the number of banks reporting that they
had established more stringent criteria to qualify for the prime rate clearly
exceeded the number that had eased standards of credit worthiness; those
indicating tightening were predominantly medium-size banks (those with
assets of $1/2 billion to $5 billion.) There was some slight evidence that
the criteria to qualify for a spread over prime also had been tightened.
The number of banks reporting a greater willingness to make short-term
fixed rate loans declined somewhat, perhaps reflecting concerns that the
upward pressure on short-term interest rates would persist in the near term.
As in the last survey, the number of banks reporting a decreased willingness
to make long-term fixed rate loans exceeded the number expressing an increased
willingness.
There was no significant change in compensating balance require-
ments with small proportions of respondents reporting easing and tightening.
As was the case three months earlier, only medium-size banks reported
tightening compensating balance requirements.
As in the preceding two surveys, most respondents had left essen-
tially unchanged the criteria used to evaluate credit applications from
established and local area customers, while a noticeable minority had
established firmer criteria for new and non-local customers.
The results of the current survey indicate that for most categories
of credit, including installment loans to individuals and single-family
mortgages, a fairly consistent minority of banks--generally between 10 and
15 percent--have become less willing to lend while few if any have become
more willing, about the situation that has prevailed for the last two surveys.
