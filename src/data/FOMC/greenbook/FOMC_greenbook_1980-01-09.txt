The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent indicators of economic activity suggest, on balance, that
the economy performed more strongly than expected in late 1979. In
November increases in employment and personal income growth were robust,
despite layoffs in the motor vehicle industry. In addition, gains in
retail sales outstripped continued large price increases. Areas of weak-
ness were apparent, however, the most notable being the auto industry and
residential construction. Reduced domestic auto sales led to higher
inventories in October and induced production cuts in November and early
December. Moreover, recent tight financial conditions appear to have
weakened housing activity in November, and investment spending has con-
tinued to moderate.
Employment and Production
Labor demand remained quite strong through mid-November with non-
farm payroll employment up 220,000 over the month. As in recent months,
the bulk of the hiring was reported in the trade and service industries.
Manufacturing employment was unchanged in November after falling almost
200,000 over the preceding three months. Factory layoffs have been con-
centrated in durable goods industries--particularly in motor vehicles
and steel--while strike activity has reduced payrolls in machinery. In
contrast, employment in most soft-goods industries has continued to edge
up. Since the November labor market surveys were taken, automakers have
announced further cutbacks, raising the number of indefinite layoffs
from about 100,000 in mid-November to nearly 130,000 in the third week
of December.

II-3
Total employment, as measured by the household survey, rose 350,000
in November, more than offsetting October's 220,000 decline. The in-
crease in employment, along with a decrease in unemployment, was concen-
trated among adult women and teenagers. The decline in unemployment
rates for these groups pushed the overall jobless rate down 0.2 percent-
age point to 5.8 percent.
Led by a decline in the output of autos, industrial production
decreased 0.5 percent in November to a level close to that of December
1978. The fall off in output also reflected a significant cutback in
the production of trucks and auto-related materials and parts. Industry
sources have reported further reductions in auto output in December. In
addition, output of home goods and construction supplies declined in
November, while business equipment production remained at the reduced
October level, in part reflecting the continued effect of strikes in that
sector. In line with the drop in production, capacity utilization in
manufacturing fell about 1/2 percentage point to 84.4 percent in November--
nearly 3 percentage points below its recent March peak; the large cutback
in the production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for a substantial
part of this decline.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Total personal income rose at a $21-1/4 billion annual rate (13
percent annual rate) in November after an $18 billion increase in
October. The pickup reflected a more rapid growth of private wage and
salary disbursements--almost twice the October increase--as average
weekly hours and employment in some industries increased. Payrolls
declined in the motor vehicle industry, but the drop was more than off-
set by relatively large increases in services and trade.

Although an estimate of the change in the personal consumption
deflator is not yet available for November, it appears that real dis-
posable personal income rose somewhat that month, but remained about 1
percent below its peak in December 1978. In per capita terms, real
disposable income probably dropped 2 percent over the same period.
Consumer purchases rebounded in November (latest available data),
following a decline in the previous month. The November gain in retail
sales was widespread and nominal sales excluding autos and nonconsump-
tion items increased 1.6 percent. Sales of apparel and general mer-
chandise were particularly brisk, while a significant portion of the
increased spending at food stores and gasoline service stations appar-
ently was accounted for by higher prices. Nonetheless, in real terms,
retail sales less auto and nonconsumption items are estimated to have
risen somewhat in November.
Total unit auto sales were at a 9.5 million annual rate in November,
about the same pace as in October. However, sales of domestic units fell
further to a 6.9 million unit rate, following the end of rebates and
price discounts that had stimulated demand in August and September. The
introduction of new discount schemes appeared to boost sales of domestic-
type models somewhat in the first 10 days of December, when sales rose
to a 7.7 million unit annual rate. Sales of foreign cars rose to a 2.6
million unit annual rate in November, the highest rate since May, as
recent stock shortages eased somewhat.
The University of Michigan Survey Research Center survey of con-
sumer attitudes in November indicated that consumers continued to be
pessimistic about the economy and their personal financial conditions.

The Michigan index of sentiment--a composite of 5 questions--rose slightly
from October but still was significantly below a year earlier and in the
depressed range reported during the 1974-75 recession. Results of this
survey suggest that motives to buy-in-advance-of-inflation, which have
been important since early 1977, may be diminishing even though infla-
tion expectations have been revised up. Concern about the high level
of interest rates and housing prices has heightened consumer pessimism
about housing market conditions. In November the Conference Board
confidence index--also a composite of 5 questions but with wording of a
more near-term orientation than the Michigan index--edged up after the
October rebound. However, it remains relatively low by historical
standards.
Residential Construction
Tighter financial conditions since October 6 appear to have damped
housing activity. Total housing starts fell 14 percent in November to a
1.5 million unit annual rate, following an 8 percent decline in October.
Moreover, permits issued for residential building dropped to a 1.3 mil-
lion unit annual rate, the lowest monthly total since the summer of 1976.
Declines in both measures were experienced throughout much of the nation,
with the largest losses in the north central and west regions.
Residential construction activity has receded most noticeably in
the single family sector, where starts fell 23 percent from September to
November. Aside from the weather-depressed rate last February, the
November level of 966,000 starts in this sector was the lowest monthly
total since September 1975. Other incoming data also indicate some
weakening of demand pressures in the single-family market. For example,

industry sources report that total home sales declined in November, and
home prices have declined recently--particularly prices of existing
homes.
The multifamily market has shown less weakness than the single-
family sector. Even though multifamily housing starts fell 8 percent
in November, they still were more than 4 percent higher than the average
pace of the first half of the year. The relative strength in this sec-
tor undoubtedly reflects the continued tightness of rental markets in
many areas of the country.
Business Fixed Investment
Indicators of business capital spending were mixed in October and
November, but, on balance, they suggest a decline in real nonresidential
fixed investment in the fourth quarter. Shipments of nondefense capi'al
goods fell 2 percent in November--in part because of strikes in the
construction machinery industry--after little change in the previous
two months. Sales of heavy-weight trucks in October and November were
below the third quarter pace, and business purchases of automobiles
were probably down in line with the overall slump in auto sales. On the
other hand, the value of nonresidential construction put-in-place rose
4-1/2 percent in October, partly due to the unusually mild weather expe-
rienced in much of the country, before easing off in November.
Capital spending commitments suggest a further slowing of outlay
growth in the near term. New orders for nondefense capital goods in
nominal terms rose 1.5 percent in November and were close to the level
around which they have fluctuated since last spring. Contracts for non-
residential construction also have shown little overall growth since

early in 1979. In addition, a 13.5 percent increase in net capital appro-
priations by large manufacturers in the third quarter did little more
than offset an 11 percent decline in the second quarter. Excluding the
volatile petroleum industry, these appropriations were 6 percent below
the record level reached in the first quarter.
In contrast to the commitments data, the most recent Commerce
Department survey of plant and equipment expenditures--taken in late
October and November--suggests a further rise in capital spending through
the first half of 1980. According to the survey, businesses in November
anticipated that expenditures would rise at a 14.7 percent annual rate
in the fourth quarter of 1979 and at an annual rate of 12.8 percent during
the first half of 1980; manufacturers of durable goods were planning the
most substantial increases. However, these survey results should be inter-
preted with some caution since the track record over the years has been
somewhat uneven. Moreover, the spending growth planned over the first
half of the year, as indicated by this survey, appears to be higher than
the increases implied by two private surveys, which reported anticipated
expenditures for all of 1980.
Inventory Investment
The pace of inventory investment rebounded in October (the latest
month for which total business inventory data are available) from an
exceptionally low September rate. In large part this reflected a turn-
around in the stocks of motor vehicles and parts. The book value of
total manufacturing and trade inventories increased at a $50 billion
annual rate, about the same as the average rate of accumulation during
the first nine months of the year. Stocks of motor vehicles and parts,

which fell at more than a $30 billion annual rate in September, rose at
a $7 billion rate in October. Overall, however, the inventory to sales
ratio for manufacturing and trade remained unchanged in October.
Retail trade stocks rose at an annual rate of $17 billion in
October, following a $19 billion rate decline in September. This turn-
around, as already indicated, can be attributed in large part to the
buildup at dealers of motor vehicles, following two months of rapid
liquidation. However, dealers' unit stocks of domestic autos again
edged down somewhat in November. Manufacturers added to inventories at
a $25 billion annual rate in October, down somewhat from the average of
the first three quarters, but still fairly high in comparison with annual
averages for recent years. The October increase was entirely in durable
goods, with most of the accumulation at producers of aircraft and
machinery. By stage of fabrication, the book value of manufacturers'
materials and supplies increased at a $14 billion annual rate in October,
after remaining unchanged in September. The rise in these stocks over
the six months ending in October had been at a moderate $9 billion annual
rate.
Government Sector
Available Treasury data now indicate that the federal government's
unified budget deficit in the fourth quarter of 1979 was $25 billion
(not seasonally adjusted), up slightly from a year earlier. To date,
outlay growth has exceeded earlier Administration expectations, with
gains particularly noticeable in defense, interest payments on the public
debt, and CCC loans to farmers. Congressional action on the military
appropriations bill and Administration commitments for higher real defense

II-18
expenditures both suggest that the recent sizable rise in arms spending
is likely to continue in the year ahead. On the receipts side of the
budget, federal tax collections also increased more than anticipated,
mainly because of larger than expected gains in nominal income that
further boosted receipts of withheld taxes.
Both the Senate and House have now passed bills imposing a "wind-
fall" tax on the additional producers' revenues that result from the
phased decontrol of oil prices. Over the 1980-1990 period, the tax pro-
ceeds of the conference committee version of the bill are tentatively
estimated at $227 billion. The Senate bill earmarks a portion of these
revenues to fund mass transit projects, low income heating assistance,
and energy conservation and development programs.
Spending by state and local governments appears to have slowed
recently, with construction outlays falling and employment remaining
essentially unchanged. New construction put-in-place, typically a
volatile series, decreased 5 percent in November, following a robust
8-1/2 percent increase in October. In real terms, expenditures continued
to run around 8 percent below the peak level of October 1978. State and
local government payrolls reportedly changed little in November, following
a small decrease in the previous month. The sector's weak employment
picture reflects, in part, reductions in federal appropriations for sub-
sidized public service jobs for the 1980 fiscal year.
Prices
Aggregate price measures continued to rise during October and
November at about the same rapid pace as in earlier months of 1979.
Consumer prices advanced by 1 percent in both months, continuing the

steady 13 percent annual rate of increase observed so far in 1979.
Producer prices for finished goods rose at an annual rate of nearly 16
percent in November, slightly more than the average increase over the
three previous months. Prices of materials continued to rise rapidly
at the crude level, for both foodstuffs and nonfood materials, but
slowed at the intermediate level.
Increases in homeownership costs accounted for a substantial part
of the CPI advances in October and November. This component, with a
relative importance weight of nearly one-fourth of the overall index,
rose at about a 27 percent annual rate over the two months, as the CPI
measures of both home prices and mortgage interest rates continued to
increase sharply. The rise in mortgage interest rates is due, in part,
to the increases in the FHA/VA ceiling rates in September and October.
Recent increases in commitment rates for conventional mortgage financing,
which lead the closing rates used in the CPI by about 1 quarter, suggest
no near-term slowing of increases in the mortgage rate component. In
other shelter costs, rents accelerated sharply in October, probably re-
flecting a passthrough of fuel costs, but rose less rapidly in November.
Retail food price increases were somewhat smaller in November,
after substantial advances in September and October. This moderation
was partly due to a slower rise in meat prices, with beef prices regis-
tering a small decline following 2 months of large increases. Advances
in prices of crude foodstuffs, a leading indicator of near-term retail
food prices, have averaged about 1-1/4 percent per month over the last
three months, with a 2 percent rise in November.

II-21
Energy price increases have slowed markedly in recent months,
although they remain quite large. Renewed acceleration seems likely in
the near term, however, as a number of oil companies recently have
announced sizable gasoline price hikes. These price increases are in
response to a further round of imported crude oil price hikes, some of
which were made retroactive to November 1.
Price pressures have been less evident outside the food, energy
and homeownership areas; nevertheless, prices of other consumer goods
and services have generally advanced in 1979 at a pace slightly above
that in 1978. These larger price increases reflect, for the most part,
past changes in labor costs, which accelerated sharply in 1978, while
energy and materials costs play a much smaller role. Price increases
for capital equipment slowed in November, with smaller increases for
many machinery groupings as well as a slight decline for trucks; but
so far in 1979 they have increased at a pace slightly higher than during
1978. Price increases of intermediate materials also slowed considerably
in Novemeer, but remained about 12 percent above their level a year ago.
Wages
The average hourly earnings index rose at a 9-1/2 percent annual
rate in November. The index has risen at an annual rate of 8 percent
since the preceding December, compared to an 8-1/2 percent increase
during 1978. The nondurable manufacturing sector and the transportation
industry, in which a new Teamsters' contract was negotiated last spring,
have been the major sectors where an acceleration in wages has occurred
since 1978. The moderation in wages in other sectors has been most
marked in trade and in contract construction.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates in securities markets declined further following
the November FOMC meeting, extending the downtrend from peak levels
that began in late October-early November. A portion of this decline
has been erased since late November, however, in response to indications
that economic activity was less weak than expected in the fourth quarter
and to increasing concerns about the inflationary implications of OPEC
actions.
Over the intermeeting period as a whole, short-term rates have
registered net declines of about 20 to 60 basis points and major banks
have lowered their prime rates 50 basis points to 15-1/4 percent.
Treasury bond yields have also dropped about 20 to 60 basis points while
yields on high grade corporate issues, municipal bonds, and home mort-
gages have changed only minimally. Short-term rates are now about 1/2
to 1-1/2 percentage points, and bond yields about 1/2 to 1 percentage
point, above levels prevailing at the time of the October 6 meeting.
Because of the uncertainties that continue to influence attitudes
in financial markets, demands for highly liquid investments have remained
strong since the November FOMC meeting and yield spreads between securi-
ties of differing quality have generally widened a bit. In spite of the
short-range uncertainty among market participants, there still appears
to be a consensus that interest rates will be declining significantly in
1980. This outlook is reflected, for example, in the Treasury bill
futures market where rates on 90-day bills for June 1980 delivery are
almost 2 percentage points below spot market quotations.

Aggregate credit flows to the private sector generally appear
to have weakened during the fourth quarter. In addition to the sharp
rise in the cost of credit, this development reflects the effects of a
significant tightening of lending standards and terms, as well as some
dropoff in credit demands with the apparent slackening of economic
growth. Business net borrowing at commercial banks and in the commer-
cial paper market, after slowing in October, turned negative in November
before apparently recovering moderately in early December. Offerings
of longer-term securities by nonfinancial corporations remained light
in November and December. Installment borrowing by households weakened
noticeably in October and November, and mortgage lending fell sharply
in November. Treasury borrowing on the other hand, was comparatively
heavy in the fourth quarter, reflecting a large fourth-quarter deficit,
and state and local financing remained sizable.
The monetary aggregates grew at a reduced pace during the final
quarter of 1979. M-1 advanced at about a 5-1/2 percent annual rate in
December and 5 percent for the quarter as a whole. M-2 growth deceler-
ated during the quarter, reflecting the moderation in M-1 and a slowing
in the interest-bearing component of the broader aggregate.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Despite the moderate pickup of M-1 growth in December, the fourth
quarter gain was only about half the 9-3/4 percent advance in the third
quarter. The slower pace of economic expansion and the attraction of
unusually high nominal yields on interest-bearing assets damped growth
of M-1 during the quarter. The impact on M-1 growth of movements into
ATS and NOW accounts meanwhile was negligible.

Time and savings deposit flows at commercial banks in November
and December continued to exhibit the wide monthly swings typical of the
past year. On balance, growth in the interest-bearing component of M-2
was less rapid in the fourth quarter than in the third. While the time
deposit portion strengthened, there was a large contraction in savings
deposits-an outflow that apparently crested in November at a record
$6-1/4 billion.
Particularly strong growth for small time deposits at banks in
the fourth quarter was fueled entirely by MMCs. In the year and a half
since MMCs were introduced, they have more than accounted for the cumu-
lative growth in small time deposits, and by October had reached 40 per-
cent of the outstanding stock of these deposits (see chart on page 111-6).
Net issuance of MMCs abated somewhat following October's record $15
billion increase, although substantial sums reportedly remain in savings
accounts with balances over $10,000 which could be readily converted
into MMCs.1
MMC issuance at thrift institutions also remained brisk in November,
though below the October pace, while large net withdrawals were made from
passbook accounts. Fragmentary data suggest that this disparity may have
moderated somewhat at S&Ls in December, as at banks. S&Ls continued to
rely heavily on large time deposits in November, but reportedly cut back
on their issuance in December. Overall, growth in thrift deposits-and

and the maximum nominal rate is set for thrifts at 50 basis points below
the market yield on a 2-1/2 year Treasury obligation (75 basis points
for commercial banks). Also effective on this date, the rate ceiling
on 90-day to 1-year deposits has been increased by 25 basis points.

in M-3-slowed during November, then apparently picked up a little in
December.1
At the same time that savers were acquiring additional MMCs and
reducing their fixed-ceiling deposits in the fourth quarter, they were
also expanding their holdings of nondeposit assets sharply further.
Money market mutual funds, for instance, swelled by $3 to $4 billion a
month during the final quarter, and in November noncompetitive tenders
at 3- to 6-month Treasury bill auctions reached their highest monthly
total of the year before slowing somewhat in December.
Managed liabilities at banks rose less than $1 billion in November,
well below the nearly $6 billion increase in the previous month. As in
October, the increase in managed liabilites was entirely in the form of
large-denomination time deposits issued in domestic markets, which
expanded $6 billion before contracting in December; nondeposit funds,
principally repurchase agreements, declined in November (December data
are unavailable). Some banks reportedly were attempting to keep managed
liabilities from rising above base levels in order to avoid incurring
marginal reserve requirements. A number of large member banks, particu-
larly those with weak loan demand, have remained under this base, as
have most U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks, since late Novem-
ber. For all banks, managed liabilities subject to marginal reserve
requirements averaged $5 billion in November-equal to about 2 percent
of all managed liabilities--and declined in December, reflecting in
part a runoff of large time deposits.
1. An appendix in the Greenbook supplement will discuss recent develop-
ments regarding S&L liability structures.

III-8
Total reserve growth rebounded to a 15-1/4 percent annual rate in
December, raising the average growth rate over the September-to-December
period to 13-3/4 percent. This rate exceeded the growth of required
reserves over the same period by 2 percentage points, as excess reserves
doubled over the three months, perhaps reflecting uncertainties related
in part to the new operating procedures. Despite a December spurt in the
growth of nonborrowed reserves, this reserve aggregate advanced slightly
more slowly than total reserves from September to December, a development
associated with an increase over the three months in member bank borrow-
ing at the discount window.
Total bank credit remained about unchanged in November following a
relatively small advance in October, as an increase in investments offset
a slight decline in total loans, centered in business and security loans.
Mortgage loan growth, which in large part reflected commitment decisions
made before October 6, was only slightly below the pace of other recent
months.
Business Sector Finance
Bank lending to businesses (net of bankers acceptances held) con-
tracted in November, in contrast to double-digit increases earlier in
the year. Small banks shared in the weakness that had first developed
at large banks and at foreign-related institutions in the previous month.
Slackening business demand for short- and intermediate-term credit was
suggested also by the sharp November drop in commercial paper outstanding
and by the abrupt slowing of growth in total bankers acceptances in
October.1 This weakness appears to have abated in December. In the first

three weeks of the month, outstanding business loans at large banks were
about unchanged, and commercial paper issuance picked up significantly.1
The slowdown in business lending at banks in November reflected
curtailed availability of credit, as well as reduced demand, according
to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey of Bank Lending Practices
taken in mid-month. Two-fifths of the respondent banks-about double
the number in August--expressed a reduced willingness to extend business
loans, and a large number reported tighter standards of creditworthiness
and more stringent compensating balance requirements. Consistent with
these tighter policies, the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending for November
indicated that fewer loans were being made without prior commitment and
that a higher proportion carried floating rates.2 Moreover, there was a
substantial decline in the proportion of short-term loan extensions made
below prime at large banks.
Gross public offerings of corporate bonds in November and December
fell substantially below the average monthly levels of the second and
third quarters, a decline that occurred in the face of deterioriating
balance sheet conditions. Most measures of corporate financial position
indicated weakness on a par with 1974 experience. Corporate bond under-
writers have generally attributed the recent low volume of industrial
debt financings to a widespread reluctance to issue longer-term debt at

near-record interest rates.1 A relatively light volume of financial
issues in the fourth quarter partly reflected a slowdown in offerings of
mortgage-backed bonds by S&Ls.
Private placements of corporate bonds appear to have remained well
below the $1.6 billion pace recorded in the first half of 1979. Because
corporate bond commitments are currently low at life insurance companies
(the principal investor in private placements), takedowns are unlikely
to recover substantially in coming months. Life insurance industry repre-
sentatives cite a comparatively large volume of mortgage commitments out-
standing and the expectation of a somewhat slower growth in cash flow as
reasons for the reduced pace of corporate bond acquisitions. In addition,
policy-loan extensions have climbed dramatically since October 6, thereby
reducing total investable funds. The proportion of funds diverted to
policy loans, however, has probably been below the near-record share
recorded in the third quarter of 1974.
Although fluctuating rather widely, corporate bond yields have
changed little on balance since the November FOMC meeting. Rate spreads
between quality categories of corporate bonds have widened somewhat in
recent weeks, however. These spreads are generally about twice as large
as they were prior to October 6, though well below levels reached in mid-
October.
Most major stock price indexes have risen about 3 to 10 percent
from their levels at the time of the November FOMC meeting. A somewhat

reduced slate of new equity offerings in December was again dominated
by public utility issues.
Government Debt Markets
With the federal budget moving substantially further into deficit
in the fourth quarter and with a large deficit also projected for the
first quarter, the Treasury raised an estimated $18 billion in new cash
during the October-December period. Given the large need for new money
at a time when a sizable volume of coupon issues was maturing, the
Treasury for the first time since 1976 began to make significant net
additions to the weekly bill auction. New funds raised in this manner
totaled $3.7 billion for the quarter. The Treasury also issued about
$7.3 billion of cash management bills dated to mature in the spring, sub-
stantially above the volume of such bills issued in other recent fourth
quarters.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies totaled a
relatively strong $2.3 billion in November, after seasonal adjustment,
and is estimated at about $3.0 billion in December. Borrowing by the
Federal Home Loan Banks to rebuild liquidity, by FNMA to finance mortgage
acquisitions, and by the Farm Credit Banks to meet intensified credit
demands all contributed to the continued strong growth in federal agency
indebtedness. For the full fourth quarter, borrowing by the sponsored
credit agencies amounted to about $8.3 billion-the largest quarterly
volume ever recorded--and this brought total agency borrowing for the
year to a record $23.9 billion.

A large volume of new state and local government bond issues has
been absorbed in recent weeks. Yields on tax-exempts nonetheless have
edged downward on balance, with dealers reporting continued strong demand
for tax-exempt securities from banks and casualty insurance companies.
The decline in municipal bond rates has kept the ratio of tax-exempt to
taxable yields close to its historic low recorded in October of 1979.
Offerings of tax-exempt bonds averaged $4.1 billion per month,
seasonally adjusted, in November and December, somewhat less than in
October but well above the $3.4 billion monthly average of the first
three quarters. About one-half of the increase in bond offerings for
new capital in the fourth quarter was attributable to a rise in housing
revenue bonds. These issues averaged about $1.0 billion per month,
divided nearly equally between single- and multi-family housing issues.
The single-family issues are still coming to market under rules estab-
lished last April for bond offerings that were under way at that time,
when restrictive legislation was first proposed. Since then, about
$4.1 billion of these bonds have been sold. A more recent legislative
proposal would liberalize the transition rules sufficiently to permit
an additional $10 billion of single-family mortgage revenue bonds to
be sold, according to estimates released by the House Ways and Means
Committee. For 1979 as a whole, states and localities raised $10
billion through housing revenue bonds, $7 billion of which was used
for single-family housing.
Dealers reported that a portion of the increased volume of new
capital issues other than housing revenue bonds represented offerings

that had been delayed earlier in the year, when interest rates had been
expected to decline.
Mortgage Markets
Commitment policies at mortgage lenders have tightened markedly
since October. The proportion of major lenders offering commitments for
conventional home mortgages was down sharply in early November for all
loan-to-value ratio classes (see chart on page 111-17). Special FHLBB
surveys of large S&Ls suggest that, although some associations liberal-
ized their commitment policies in late November and early December
following an earlier pronounced tightening or complete closedown, S&L
commitment policy generally remained much more stringent than in September
and early October.1 Data for all operating S&Ls indicate that mortgage
commitments outstanding (including loans in process) declined by 10 per-
cent during November to $29.3 billion, and that new commitment volume
fell by more than 40 percent. New commitments dropped sharply in each of
the 12 FHLBank districts.
In a late-November Federal Reserve survey of commercial banks usu-
ally active in the home mortgage market, about two-thirds of respondents
reported that they had tightened their mortgage lending policies after
October 6, primarily by increasing effective interest rates charged
(where permitted by existing ceilings). A mid-December survey of
economic and financial developments by the research directors of the
Federal Reserve Banks suggested that mortgage lending had fallen sharply,
1. These surveys were conducted as part of a study (coordinated by the
Council of Economic Advisers) of changes in mortgage commitment policies
at major lenders subsequent to October 6.

as potential borrowers were deterred by higher interest rates and by more
stringent nonrate terms.
Special surveys of mutual savings banks and mortgage companies
also revealed substantial tightening of lending policies. The mortgage
companies reported that the supply of funds for FHA/VA lending continued
to be adequate, primarily because the GNMA-guaranteed mortgage-backed
securities provide access to the general capital markets. However, they
also reported that the demand for FHA/VA funds had weakened considerably
owing to high yields required by investors and substantial discounts on
loans bearing the current 11-1/2 percent ceiling rate. The availability
of funds for conventional loans at mortgage companies apparently has been
sharply reduced as permanent investors have cut back the volume of pur-
chase commitments issued to mortgage bankers.
Average interest rates at S&Ls on new conventional mortgage commit-
ments have remained at the exceptionally high levels reached in early
November, while secondary market yields have dropped below their early-
November highs. In view of high market yields on competing investments,
constraints posed by state usury ceilings on conventional home mortgage
lending have remained intense. During December, 16 states had fixed
ceilings below national average mortgage yields, and in several other
states floating rate ceilings tied to Treasury yields were below going
mortgage yields. However, on December 28 the President signed into law
a bill that temporarily exempts from state usury limits conventional
first mortgages made by most types of lenders for the purchase of resi-
dential property. Unless revoked by state action, the exemption will

III-20
apply until March 31, 1980, and covers new mortgage commitments made, as
well as loans closed, during the suspension period.
Consumer Credit
Despite considerable variability since mid-year, growth in consumer
installment credit outstanding has tapered off substantially, on balance.
Expansion averaged around an 8 percent annual rate in October and November,
the slowest pace since 1975. The slowdown was most pronounced for auto
credit. New loan extensions by credit unions fell in both months,
reflecting limitations on lending because of liquidity problems. The
amount of installment loans outstanding at credit unions contracted in
October for the first time in over seven years and apparently was down
further in November.
During the fourth quarter, sharply increasing costs of funds gave
impetus to less accommodative consumer loan policies--especially in
states where finance rates were subject to restrictive rate ceilings.1
Commercial banks rationed supplies of consumer credit to a greater
extent than before, judging from results of the latest Survey of Senior
Bank Loan Officer Opinion. Forty-one percent of the mid-November sample
responded that they were moderately less willing or much less willing to
make installment loans to individuals than they had been three months
earlier. Reports in late December from the research directors of several
Federal Reserve Banks confirm an upgrading of consumer lending standards.
Sharply higher consumer finance rates also reveal a movement towards
less accommodative policies. Finance rates on selected types of closed-

end consumer installment credit at a sample of commercial banks increased
by record amounts between August and November of 1979. The average
finance rate on new-car loan contracts at finance companies rose sharply,
too, nearly equalling the previous largest 3-month rise. The sizable
rate hikes from August to November suggest that finance rates may be
approaching their statutory limits in an increasing number of states.

APPENDIX A*
TREATMENT OF BANKERS ACCEPTANCES IN THE MEASURE OF SHORT AND INTERMEDIATE
TERM BUSINESS CREDIT
A bankers acceptance-which is a negotiable time draft maturing in
less than nine months, guaranteed by a bank, and drawn to finance the
shipment or storage of goods--is a financial instrument with characteris-
tics akin to both a business loan and a short-term security. On the one
hand, bankers acceptance financing generally is treated like a straight
loan in a bank's negotiation of a line of credit with a business borrow-
er. And, if an acceptance, when created, is then bought and held in the
portfolio of a bank, it represents funds extended by the bank to a C & I
customer. On the other hand, there is an active secondary market in
bankers acceptances, and in most instances banks can treat these accep-
tances like any other short-term security.
Acceptance financing of trade has grown rapidly in recent years, a
development not adequately captured by the previous measure of short-
and intermediate-term business credit. The previous measure included
only those acceptances held in commercial bank portfolios (and there-
fore reported as business loans). This procedure had two major short-
comings. First, it failed to reflect the rapid growth in recent years
of total acceptances outstanding, since most of the acceptances created
were held by nonbanks (see chart on page A-3). Second, movements in the
old measure sometimes were influenced by factors other than business
credit market conditions, as banks altered their holdings of bankers
acceptances to reduce taxes.1/
The new measure of short- and intermediate-term business credit in-
cludes business loans at domestically chartered commercial banks and at
U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks less bankers a ceptances held
at large commercial banks and foreign related institutions plus
1. In 1975-77, some banks boosted their holdings of acceptances at yearend
in order to enlarge C & I loan totals and thus to increase loan loss pro-
visions to reduce income taxes. Acceptances held then ran off sharply
at the beginning of each subsequent year. In the past two years, there
has been less of an incentive to manipulate their acceptance port-
folios because loan growth has been sufficient to build up the loan loss
provision and because changes in the tax laws have made the artificial
buildup less profitable.
2. No data are available for acceptances held at small banks. However,
the amount held at these banks is estimated to be relatively insignifi-
cant.

business credit grew at a 23 percent annual rate (column 10). The rate
of expansion of this measure has been falling since August, and is
expected to be negative in November.

RATE CEILINGS ON CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOANS
Recent record increases in finance rates on closed-end consumer
installment loans at commercial banks, and similar large increases at
finance companies, appear to confirm trade reports that rising costs
of funds have exerted strong upward pressure on rates. Other reactions
to cost pressures, especially in states where statutory ceilings have
hindered rate adjustments, have included greater reliance on tightening
lending standards and nonrate terms. Such curtailment of credit avail-
ability may partly explain the weakening of consumer credit growth since
midyear, which became more pronounced in October and November.
Rate ceilings on consumer loans typically are set by special
statutes enacted by states as exceptions to a general state usury law.
These consumer credit rate ceilings usually remain fixed from year to year
unless changed by legislative amendment. However, federal law permits
national banks to charge a rate one percentage point above the Federal
Reserve discount rate, regardless of state limitations.1
The rate ceilings enacted by state legislatures have created a
complex structure of rate limits on consumer credit. Within a given
state, rate ceilings typically vary not only for different types of con-
sumer credit, but also for particular sources and for various amounts of
credit. Rate ceilings also differ considerably among states. These
variations are illustrated in the table on page B-2 for specific types of
loans in five selected states.
Separate statutes ordinarily govern maximum rates on installment
sales financing and on cash loans. Laws limiting rates on the closed-
end credit sale of goods often distinguish between motor vehicles and
other goods. All but four states have special rate ceilings for credit
card balances, and maximum rates on overdraft credit are sometimes sepa-
rately established.
Rate ceilings on cash loans nearly always differ for commercial
banks as compared with "small loan" finance companies. This distinction
recognizes the higher risk and servicing costs associated with small
loans to a generally more risky clientele. In the case of credit unions,
all federally-chartered and most state-chartered institutions face a
flat 12 percent rate ceiling on consumer loans.
1. P.L. 96-161, effective in late December, relaxed state usury ceilings
for certain business and agricultural loans through June 1980 and sus-
spended them for most home mortgage loans through March 1980, unless
reestablished by state action. Consumer credit rate ceilings were not
affected.

Rate limits by loan size may be either uniform or graduated. Under
a graduated rate ceiling one rate limit applies to the portion of a loan
below a certain dollar amount. Then a second, lower ceiling rate is set
on additional sums loaned in excess of that amount. Rate ceilings with
three or more levels are fairly common. Under a graduated rate ceiling,
of course, the gross return on funds loaned will fall if the typical loan
amount increases beyond the point at which a lower rate maximum takes
effect. If larger loans do not yield sufficient offsetting reductions
in average costs, lenders may choose to curtail the amount of consumer
credit they will extend and shift resources to alternative uses.
Statutory rate limitations that currently apply to new-auto loans
suggest that ceilings in a substantial number of states may have become
seriously binding as market-determined rates have risen. In the case of
bank direct new-auto loans of $4,000, for 36 months, rate limits are now
at or below 15 percent in 33 states, as shown in the lower table on page
B-2.1  In 16 of these 33 states, the prevailing rate maximum is 13 per-
cent or less-probably below the marginal cost of lending at many providers
of auto credit.
1. Ceilings are generally expressed as "add on" or "discount" rates,
which convert to effective annual percentage rates that vary with maturity.
In a few states, auto loan rate ceilings vary with loan size. Ceilings
for this type of loan are the same for other lenders as for banks in
most, but not all, states.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets
Over the last two months of 1979 and the first week of the new
year, the dollar's average exchange value declined by 4-1/4 percent.
As shown in Chart 1, this decline entirely reversed the dollar's sharp
rise in October. On January 3, 1980, the weighted-average dollar
was 1-1/3 percent below its value at the end of 1978, and slightly
below its low point at the beginning of October 1979.
A major factor influencing exchange rate fluctuations over the
final quarter of last year was the relative movement of U.S. and foreign
short-term interest rates. During October, U.S. interest rates rose
sharply, both absolutely and relative to interest rates abroad. Over
November and December, however, U.S. short-term interest rates declined
on balance while foreign rates continued to rise; since the beginning
of November discount rates were increased in all foreign G-10 countries
except France. By the end of the year, the U.S. three-month CD rate
was only 1-1/2 percentage points above the weighted-average foreign
three-month interest rate, down sharply from a nearly 4 percentage
point differential at the beginning of November and below the level
prevailing when new Federal Reserve monetary measures were announced
on October 6.
The onset of the Iranian crisis in early November also contri-
buted to selling pressure on the dollar, especially the U.S. freeze
of Iranian official assets on November 14 which led to speculation
that other oil exporting countries might become reluctant to hold
dollar-denominated assets. In December, the meeting of OPEC oil

ministers focused market attention on the sharp escalation of oil prices.
Uncertainty over the impact of these increases, as well as the contin-
uing Iranian crisis and the situation in Afghanistan, led to unsettled
conditions on exchange markets with sharp and volatile fluctuations
in rates. This heightened uncertainty was also reflected in the very
sharp rise in the gold price. Gold prices rose by nearly $250 an
ounce in December and early January, moving above the $600 per ounce
level.
Japan's heavy dependence on imported oil and the pros-
pect of higher oil prices combined to generate downward pressure
on the yen relative to all other major foreign currencies. Conversely,
Britain's oil self-sufficiency was a major factor in the relative
strength of the pound late in the year.
On November 30 the Danish krone was devalued by 5 percent relative
to all other EMS currencies. Following this realignment, the Belgian
franc moved to the bottom of the EMS currency band and the Belgian
National Bank sold dollars and French francs to support the Belgian
currency.
U.S. intervention since the November green book provided net
intervention support for the dollar equivalent to $1/3 billion, with
sales of German marks at times of downward pressure on the dollar
exceeding mark purchases --

sales to support the dollar were financed equally by the System and
the Treasury while nearly all fdreign currency acquisitions were used
to repay System swap drawings. As a result, outstanding System swap
debt was reduced slightly to about $3-1/4 billion equivalent.

IV-5
U.S. International Transactions
The trade balance continued to improve in October and November;
the deficit for the two months averaged $26 billion at an annual rate.
Agricultural exports climbed again, reaching an average annual rate of
$41.3 billion in October and November, with most of the increase going
to the Soviet Union. Transportation bottlenecks have not limited
agricultural exports as much as expected. Nonagricultural exports
were also above the third quarter level; the average for October and
November was up almost 9 per cent. The advance was widely based, with
exports of industrial supplies (e.g., nonmonetary gold and chemicals)
particularly strong.

Nonpetroleum imports averaged $160 billion (annual rate) in
October and November, up 5 per cent from the third quarter, Petroleum
imports fell in value to $66 billion in November, after reaching al-
most $78 billion in October (annual rates). Volume dropped sharply in
November, as stocks peaked at very high levels early in the month and
then leveled off. Petroleum unit values continued to climb, reaching
$23.08 in November, up from an average of $20.97 for the third quarter.
Only part of this increase was due to higher official contract prices;
part was due to increases in the percentage purchased at spot market
prices. It is estimated that more than 15 per cent of U.S. imports
were purchased at prices of $35 to $40 in November.
The U.S. current account for the third quarter of 1979 showed a
surplus of $3 billion (annual rate). Net investment income increased
sharply from $30 billion in the second quarter to $35 billion in the
third (annual rates). This increase was mainly attributable to the
growth in earnings on U.S. direct investments abroad, both in petro-
leum and in other industries.
Turning to capital flows, foreign official reserve assets in the
United States fell by $2.5 billion in October. Holdings of the OPEC
countries increased by $2.3 billion but holdings of the G-10 countries
and Switzerland fell by $3.5 billion. Japan accounted for a large part
of this decrease. Partial data for November and December indicate that
foreign official holdings at the FRBNY declined by $5 billion.

IV-8
.OPEC holdings at the FRBNY were virtually unchanged in the last
two months of the year.
Private capital flows reported by banking offices in the United
States showed a net inflow of $3.9 billion in October. The net inflow
was more than accounted for by a reduction in banks' loans to un-
affiliated banking offices abroad. Partial data for November indicates
that U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks continued to shift
loans to non-affiliated foreign banks to the books of their offshore
offices. By shifting such loans to foreign banking offices, agencies
and branches have been able to reduce their Eurodollar managed lia-
bilities, which are subject to the October 6 marginal reserve require-
ment, by about $3 billion relative to their base levels.
In October the interest rate differential favoring Eurodollar
over domestic CDs widened and added to the existing incentive for U.S.
non-bank residents to place funds offshore. U.S. non-banks' dollar-
denominated deposits in foreign branches of member banks increased
$2.5 billion in October. This reversed the September decline and

Foreign Economic Developments. Economic growth in foreign indus-
trial countries on balance continued to be strong in the third quarter.
Significant gains in real GNP were recorded in Japan, Canada, Italy,
and France. In Canada, and, to a lesser extent in France, private
domestic demand expanded vigorously; increases in exports and inven-
tories boosted activity in Japan, while a cessation of strike activity
accounted for the Italian gains. On the other hand, strike activity
in the United Kingdom accounted for much of the 2 percent fall of real
GDP during the third quarter. In Germany, the third quarter saw a
slowing in the rate of expansion after a 2 percent increase in real
GNP during the second quarter.
Inflation proceeded at a high and, in several cases, rising rate
in most of the major foreign countries. Oil price increases, various
special factors, and, for Japan, currency depreciation were important
contributors to the inflationary process.
Since the previous green book, discount rates have been increased
in the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands
and Belgium. In several of these countries, the increases were quite
large; the U.K. and Italian rates each rose by 300 basis points, while
the Norwegian rate increased by 200 basis points. Continuing high
inflation rates generally were cited as reasons for these increases;
exchange-rate considerations and efforts to achieve monetary targets
were more proximate factors in several countries.
Monetary targets recently announced for Germany, the United
Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland indicate a desire to retard money
supply growth. The target range for German central bank money is a

IV-11
growth rate between 5 and 8 percent from 1979-Q4 to 1980-Q4, compared
with the 6 to 9 percent target range for 1979 and the 7.5 percent
growth actually achieved in the year ending in October. The target
range for sterling M3 growth, currently 7 to 11 percent for the ten
months from mid-June, was extended through next October, but with the
base remaining at the mid-June level. Thus the rapid growth in ster-
ling M3 -- nearly 14 percent (s.a.a.r.) from mid-June to mid-October --
will not be built into the target over the next twelve months. The
target range for Canadian M1 growth is between 5 and 9 percent from
the second quarter of 1979, compared with the target range of between
6 and 10 percent from June 1978 and actual growth of 7 percent from
June 1978 to November 1979. Finally, the Swiss National Bank has
announced a target of 4 percent growth in the monetary base for 1980.
The most notable development regarding current-account balances
continues to be the shift towards deficit among foreign G-10 countries.
The combined current-account balances of Germany, Japan, and the United
Kingdom reached a deficit of about $18 billion in the first 11 months
of 1979 compared with a surplus of $26 billion in the corresponding
period of 1978.
Individual Country Notes. Despite persistent strong inflation
and virtual consensus among forecasters of an imminent slowdown in
the Japanese economy, most recent figures for industrial production
and GNP suggest that the economy is continuing to expand strongly.
Third quarter GNP was about 7-1/4 percent (a.r.) above the preceding
quarter, making it quite likely that real growth in 1979 will reach
at least 6 percent. The largest gains in real growth in the third

quarter were in net exports and private inventory accumulation. The
fact that private consumption was quite weak by comparison, however,
may foreshadow considerably weaker domestic demand in 1980. The
government sector is also not expected to be a stimulus to growth
next year given that in the recently proposed budget outline for FY
1980 real government expenditure will expand very slowly, if at all.
Inflation in wholesale prices continues to plague the economy.
Wholesale prices increased by another 1-1/2 percent in November --
the eighth consecutive month of greater than 1 percent month-to-month
increases. About half of recent increases in the WPI are attributable
to depreciation of the yen. The CPI, which has lower weights for raw
materials and fuel, increased at a much slower rate.
Japan recently has been recording its largest monthly trade- and
current-account deficits of the decade. With a $1.7 billion deficit
in the current account (and a $700 million trade deficit) in November,
the Japanese current-account deficit for all of 1979 is likely to
exceed $8 billion -- a remarkable turnabout from last year's $16-1/2
billion surplus. The recent decline in Japan's nominal trade position,
due largely to rapid increases in the prices of oil and other imported
commodities, is obscuring a strong increase of export volume. While
export volume had been flat through 1978 and early 1979, in the three
months ending in October it has advanced at over a 14 percent annual
rate.
Real GNP in Canada rose 5.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third
quarter, after declining by 2.8 percent in the second. A 5.3 percent
increase in real personal expenditures weighed heavily in the strong

IV-16
performance of GNP. However, the strength of consumption, which
accounts for 60 percent of GNP, was in part due to the spending of
income tax refunds received in the second quarter. Although personal
income was up by 8-1/2 percent, increases in personal income taxes
led to virtually no change in disposable income in the third quarter.
Real business fixed investment continued to be the strongest sector
of the economy in 1979. Investment in plant and equipment increased
by over 20 percent and non-residential construction increased by over
25 percent (s.a.a.r.). A sharp increase in before-tax profits was an
important factor in these additions to capacity.
After submitting its first budget since the May 22 elections,
the government of Canadian Prime Minister Clark lost a vote of con-
fidence ard resigned on December 14. Proposed increases of energy
and excise taxes played a role in the defeat of the Clark government.
A general election will be held on February 18.
The Italian economy rebounded strongly in September and October
after the mid-year weakness caused by widespread strike activity.
Industrial production in October was about 10 percent higher than
the July-August level (not annual rate). GDP data for the third
quarter capture only part of the rebound, showing a 1 percent increase
over the previous quarter. Business survey data point to a continued
moderate strengthening of activity for the near-term.
Consumer price data for November indicate that inflation decel-
erated somewhat after the dramatic upsurge in September and October
when prices rose a total of 5 percent. The sharp acceleration was led
by one-time increases in energy-product prices (which are administra-

IV-17
tively set) and taxes, and also by the quarterly rent adjustment in
October.
The trade balance also appears partly to have reflected the
effects of the mid-year strikes. The customs deficit (s.a., imports
c.i.f.) fell from about $2 billion in May-July, which was the period
of strikes, to $300 million in August-October.
The French economy has strengthened in the third quarter after
a weak performance in the first half of the year. Industrial produc-
tion rose dramatically during the third quarter, while real GDP
increased by about 7 percent (s.a.a.r.). However, the sharp fall
of industrial production in October may portend weaker fourth quarter
activity.
Inflation, as measured by the rate of change of the consumer
price index, accelerated during the first eleven months of last year;
in November the CPI was 11-1/2 percent above its year-earlier level.
Throughout the first eleven months of last year, wholesale prices
rose somewhat more rapidly than consumer prices, and in November they
were about 14 percent above their level of November 1978.
Growth of real GNP in Germany has slowed in the third quarter
and there are some signs that the slowdown continued in the fourth
quarter. Industrial production in the three months to October was
0.8 percent below its level during the preceeding three-month period.
Housing orders have continued to decline, retail sales have been
falling for several months, the two-year automobile boom ended in
mid-year, and orders for investment goods are rising only slowly.
However, employment (s.a.) has been rising during the year and the

IV-18
unemployment rate, at 3.6 percent, is currently at its lowest level
since 1974.
In December the consumer price index was 5.7 percent over its
year-earlier level. The monthly rate, after having dropped to 0.1
percent in August and September, accelerated again to 0.4 percent in
November and December. Wholesale prices in November were 9.6 percent
above their year-ago level. Differences in the weights accorded to
fuels and raw materials account for the different rates of increase
of these two indexes.
Germany's current account (n.s.a.) has swung from a $7.3 billion
surplus for the first eleven months of 1978 to a $4.7 billion deficit
in the corresponding period of last year; $6.8 billion of this $12.0
billion swing is accounted for by the reduction in the trade surplus.
The major factor in this swing has been worsened terms of trade rather
than adjustment in trade volume.
In the United Kingdom real GDP in the third quarter of 1979 fell
at an annual rate of about 8-1/4 percent, according to early estimates
of the output-based measure of GDP. This decline primarily resulted
from widespread strikes in the manufacturing sector. Recent data --
the October rise in industrial production, substantial increases in
the volume (s.a.) of retail sales in October and November, and increased
vehicle production (s.a.) in these two months -- suggest that real GDP
probably rebounded in the final quarter of 1979.
Wholesale and retail prices have been rising since last summer
at roughly 1 percent per month. Increases in wage settlements will
contribute to continued high inflation rates: U.K. average earnings

IV-19
in October were nearly 16-3/4 percent higher than a year ago, sharply
higher than the 14-1/2 percent year-on-year increase in September.
The large rise in the index in October was mainly due to the engineering
industry wage settlement of roughly 20 percent.
There has been a sharp turnaround in the U.K. current account
from a $2 billion surplus in 1978 to a nearly $5 billion deficit
through November of 1979. Contributing to this turnaround has been
an increase in the trade deficit (due in part to exports lost because
of strikes) despite a growing contribution from North Sea oil. In
addition, the surplus on the service account, which in 1977 and 1978
more than offset the trade deficit, has declined from $4.25 billion
in 1978 to $1.4 billion in the first three quarters of 1979. Part
of this decline has been caused by an increase in interest, profits
and dividends due overseas for foreign participation in North Sea oil.
Preliminary data indicate that the strong expansion of economic
activity that characterized the first half of 1979 in Belgium and the
Netherlands has continued into the fourth quarter, although perhaps
at a slightly slower pace in the second half of the year. Unemploy-
ment has remained approximately unchanged in the Netherlands from
January through September and has fallen slightly in Belgium during
the same period. In the Netherlands, the rate of inflation as
measured by the consumer price index increased slightly in recent
months,and in November was about 4-1/2 percent above its year-earlier
level; in Belgium it has risen from an annual rate of 3.8 percent in
the first quarter to an annual rate of 5 percent during the fourth
quarter. Because of the continued inflation and the exchange-rate

IV-20
constraint associated with participation in the EMS, both Belgium
and the Netherlands pursued tight monetary policy through the end
of 1979.
