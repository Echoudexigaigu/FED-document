The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity apparently continued to expand at a moderate
rate through the end of the year. Increases in employment and nominal
personal income were sizable in December, and the unemployment rate re-
mained in the range that has prevailed over the last year and a half.
In addition, the growth in nominal retail sales strengthened and indus-
trial production increased. At the same time, there were further
indications of weakness in some key sectors: housing starts continued
at a sharply reduced pace, consumer sentiment remained depressed, and
substantial auto-related layoffs persisted through January. Finally,
the rate of increase in both consumer and producer prices excluding food
accelerated in December.
Employment and Production
Labor demand remained firm through the middle of December as non-
farm payroll employment rose 315,000 from a month earlier. In contrast
to recent months, jobs increased in goods-producing as well as service-
producing industries. Manufacturing employment rose 110,000, after four
months of decline, but remained below its peak level of last July.
Sizable gains were posted in the machinery and equipment industries, and
the factory workweek rose 0.2 hour to 40.3 hours. Hiring in the
service-producing sector remained strong with gains concentrated in the
services, government, and finance sectors.
Total employment, as measured by the household survey, also rose
about 300,000, but unemployment edged up slightly. The jobless rate--
at 5.9 percent--remained within the 5.7 to 5.9 percent range (on the
basis of revised seasonal factors) that has prevailed since mid-1978.

Unemployment rates for major demographic groups were little changed from
their November levels.
Since the December surveys were taken, there have been increases
in insured unemployment, suggesting an emerging weakness in labor demand.
In January, the level of insured unemployment, which has been trending
up since the middle of last year, was on average somewhat above its
December level. In addition, the number of workers on indefinite layoff
in the automotive industry has increased to about 150,000, compared with
116,000 in mid-December; and there have been reports of layoffs in the
tire and steel industries in recent weeks.
The layoffs in January came on the heels of continued cutbacks in
production and capacity utilization in December in the motor vehicle and
parts, iron and steel, and rubber industries. Utilization rates for most
other manufacturing industries rose. On balance, manufacturers operated
at 84.4 percent of capacity in December, the same as in November, but
nearly 3 percent below the recent March peak.
Industrial production increased 0.3 percent in December following
small declines in October and November. In December, production of
equipment, consumer nondurable goods, and nondurable materials advanced.
Output of business equipment rose 1.0 percent with gains throughout
most of that sector, and production of defense and space equipment
continued to advance. However, output of autos, trucks and parts fell
once again in December, ending the year 26 percent below the level of a
year earlier. Auto assemblies in December were at an annual rate of
6.8 million units, about 6 percent below the November pace, and January
assemblies are expected to drop further to around a 5.9 million unit

rate. Output of construction supplies also declined further in December,
to a level almost 2 percent below the level a year earlier.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Personal income and consumer outlays continued to advance in December,
although consumers reportedly remained pessimistic about prospects for
economicactivity generally and their personal financial conditions. Per-
sonal income rose at a 13-1/2 percent annual rate, a bit faster than the
average pace earlier in the year. Private wage and salary disbursements
also increased at a substantial rate for the second month in a row,
reflecting both higher wage rates and employment gains. It appears that
real disposable personal income advanced further in December, following
moderate increases in October and November. After declining earlier in
the year, real disposable income, at year end, stood about even with its
December 1978 level.
Growth in consumer goods purchases moderated somewhat during the
fourth quarter from the third quarter pace. In December, nominal retail
sales increased about 1 percent after rising 3/4 percent in November;
for the fourth quarter as a whole, retail sales rose 2.1 percent, half
the third quarter gain. The slowing in retail sales from the third
quarter has been concentrated in durable goods; nominal sales of furni-
ture and appliances fell 2.7 percent in December and were down 7 per-
cent from the August peak. In addition, spending at automotive stores,
which has fluctuated from month to month, declined 2-1/2 percent during
the fourth quarter. Sales of most major types of nondurable goods have
been relatively well maintained.

Total new car sales in December were at a 10.6 million unit annual
rate, somewhat above the low rates recorded in October and November. For
the fourth quarter, sales were at a 9.8 million unit rate--the slowest
pace since the end of 1975. Most of the December gain was in sales of
U.S.-made autos, which increased from a 7 million unit annual rate to
an 8 million unit rate. The surge in sales reflected in large part a
continuation of company-sponsored incentive programs and increased avail-
ability of the more popular fuel-efficient models at the end of the
year. Price discounting continued into the new year, and sales of U.S.-
made models averaged a 7.9 million unit annual rate during the first
twenty days of January. Sales of new foreign cars also increased in
December, rebounding to about the record reached last spring, due
primarily to greater supplies and to favorable pricing policies on some
Japanese imports.
The University of Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC) index of
consumer sentiment and the Conference Board index of confidence declined
in December, both remaining at levels which in the past were associated
with recessions. The latest surveys were notable for their extremely
unfavorable opinions about the housing market. In addition, results
from the SRC survey indicated for the second month in a row a higher
proportion of survey respondents citing reduced credit availability and
high interest rates as factors in their view that the present is not a
good time to purchase large household durable goods; the buy-in-advance-
of-inflation rationale that seemed to have bolstered purchases during the
past two years now appears to be less important.

Housing activity weakened noticeably toward the end of 1979.
Total private housing starts were at a 1.5 million annual rate in
December, virtually unchanged from November's reduced pace, but down
significantly from the 1.8 million unit rate that had prevailed during
the summer and early fall. In addition, newly issued building permits
declined 5 percent in December and were more than 30 percent below
their recent September peak.
Multifamily housing starts fell 15 percent in December to a 456,000
unit annual rate. These starts dropped throughout the fourth quarter,
following the bulge in HUD-subsidized starts that was associated with
the end of the fiscal year. Although single-family starts increased in
December, for the fourth quarter as a whole these starts were 13 percent
below the third quarter rate. In addition, total home sales declined
sharply in November; and as a result, even though the stock of houses on
the market was down, the ratio of unsold houses to monthly sales rose to
8.3, the highest level since March 1975. Moreover, preliminary data
indicate another decline in home sales in December.
A distinct deceleration in home price movements provides further
evidence of weakening housing demand. On a seasonally adjusted basis,
increases in the price of existing homes sold slowed considerably during
the first two months of the fourth quarter, while average prices of new
homes actually fell during that period. Moreover, these trends in sales
prices have been reported for most regions of the country.

Business Fixed Investment
Shipments of nondefense capital goods increased about 3 percent
in December, primarily due to a sharp rebound by the construction equip-
ment industry where a major strike was settled. Nondefense capital
goods shipments had declined sharply in November, however, and for the
fourth quarter as a whole they were up only 0.8 percent. Orders for
nondefense capital goods increased sharply in December, rising 8 percent.
This increase reflected a surge in new orders for aircraft and parts, a
volatile series with long production lead times, while nondefense
machinery orders, more indicative of short-run demand for capital equip-
ment, rose only moderately.
Businesses continue to anticipate a slowing of capital spending
growth in 1980 from the 1979 pace. The Commerce Department annual
survey, taken in November and December, reported that firms plan to
increase spending by 10.9 percent in 1980, compared with the 14.7 percent
rise now indicated for 1979. Survey respondents expect capital goods
prices to rise about 10 percent during 1980, and the planned increase
in real plant and equipment outlays for 1980 is thus about 1 percent;
this compares with the 6 percent rise during 1979. For the recession
years 1970 and 1975, the Commerce Department December survey indicated
increases in outlays that were about 4 percentage points larger than
actually occurred.
Inventory Investment
Inventory investment slowed in November, the most recent month
for which data are available. The book value of total manufacturing
and trade inventories increased at an annual rate of $35 billion, down

from the $50 billion average pace during the first ten months of the year.
Accumulation of trade inventories moderated considerably in November from
the fairly strong October pace, as a markedy slower rise in the book
value of retail trade inventories was partly offset by a small decline
in wholesale trade stocks. At manufacturers, the rate of book value
accumulation picked up in November, with the inventory building concen-
trated in durable goods. The largest increase was in the stocks of the
aircraft, missiles, and parts industry. Shipments by manufacturing and
trade establishments were essentially unchanged in November, and the
stock-sales ratio for all manufacturing and trade edged up to 1.42 from
the October level of 1.41.
In December, dealer stocks of all U.S.-made automobiles appeared
to have moved further into line with sales, following six months of im-
balances. This adjustment reflected both the reduced level of auto
assemblies and the sales incentive programs that have persisted through-
out most of the second half. Stocks fell 90,000 units in December,
three times the decline in the preceding month, and stood more than
300,000 units below the July peak. Excess inventories were still
apparent for some large and intermediate models, however, while stocks
of some small models remained in relatively short supply. The decline
in total stocks evidently continued in January, since production was
reduced below the apparent pace of sales.
Government Sector
The federal government deficit, measured on an NIPA basis, is
now estimated to have been about unchanged in the fourth quarter from
the third quarter's annual rate of $11.2 billion, as a sharp 4.0 percent

increase in receipts offset a similar increase in federal outlays. The
7 percent federal pay raise, sharply higher Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) outlays, and increases in defense purchases all contributed to the
strong growth of federal expenditures.
The administration now estimates that spending and receipts on a
unified budget basis will total $564 billion and $524 billion, respectively,
in fiscal year 1980. For fiscal year 1981, the administration has proposed
a budget with outlays of $616 billion, receipts of $600 billion, and a
deficit of $16 billion. The revised 1980 budget estimates and the 1981
budget incorporate the effects of the embargo on grain sales to the Soviet
Union and the planned increase in defense spending. The grain embargo is
expected to result in CCC direct purchases of $2.0 billion as well as
$0.8 billion for the acreage set-aside program in fiscal year 1980. The
increase in defense spending in fiscal year 1981 reflects the decision
to raise the long-term rate of growth in defense budget authority from
the previously planned 3 percent in real terms to 5 percent. (A detailed
description of the President's budget will be presented in an Appendix
in the Supplement to the Greenbook.)
State and local government employment increased about 40,000 in
December, more than twice the average monthly rise earlier in the year.
Employment was essentially unchanged in October and November, largely
as a result of a sharp reduction in the public service employment program
(part of CETA) beginning with fiscal year 1980. At the end of November,
these jobs, which are aimed at hiring those unemployed for structural or
cyclical reasons, were more than 30 percent below their 600,000 peak in
August.

Productivity and Labor Costs
Labor cost pressures remained intense in late 1979, reflecting in
part continued poor productivity performance. Output per hour in the
private nonfarm business sector decreased at a 1/2 percent annual rate
in the fourth quarter to a level 2-1/4 percent below a year earlier.
This marked the fourth consecutive quarter of decline--the longest since
the 1974-75 recession, when productivity fell for seven quarters.
Hourly compensation in the private nonfarm business sector rose
at nearly a 9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter; this increase,
combined with the drop in productivity, drove unit labor costs to a level
11-1/2 percent higher than a year earlier. In December, wage rates for
nonfarm production workers, as measured by the index of average hourly
earnings, rose at a 10 percent annual rate to a level 8-1/4 percent above
a year ago. Manufacturing wages also increased at a 10 percent annual
rate, somewhat above the gains registered earlier in the quarter, and
wages in the transportation and services sectors were also up sharply in
December.
"Effective" wage rate increases for workers covered by major con-
tracts, which include new settlements, deferred increases, and cost-of-
living adjustment (COLA) payments, have been relatively moderate given
the acceleration of prices; they were 8-3/4 percent in 1979, up from
8-1/4 percent during 1978. First-year wage-rate increases in major
collective bargaining settlements (those covering 1,000 or more workers)
averaged 7-1/2 percent in 1979, about the same as in the previous year.
Over the life of the contracts, annual wage advances excluding potential
increases under COLA clauses were set at 6 percent in 1979, down from

II-22
6-1/2 percent in 1978. For larger units, where data are reported on
fringe benefits as well as wages, settlements provided increases of
about 9 percent in the first year, and about 6-1/2 percent annually
over the life of the contract (excluding COLAs).
Prices
Recent data indicate that inflation accelerated at the end of
last year. In December, consumer prices increased 1.2 percent, a bit
above the pace prevailing throughout most of the year. As a result,
the consumer price index (CPI) increased 13.3 percent over the year,
a marked speedup from the 9 percent rise during 1978. Producer prices
of finished goods rose less in December than in recent months, reflec-
ting a slight decline in prices of consumer foods, but were 12-1/2 per-
cent above a year earlier; excluding food, the rate of increase in
these prices accelerated in December.
Consumer prices of energy items resumed their rapid rate of rise
in December. As a result of recent hikes in crude oil prices, gasoline
and fuel oil prices rose 2-3/4 and 1-1/2 percent, respectively. More-
over, further large increases have been announced by major refineries
and will likely show up in the CPI during the next few months. Addi-
tionally, transportation costs have been boosted by price increases for
new US.-made autos that were effective early in January.
Food prices at the consumer level picked up in December as meat
prices rose substantially following earlier increases in livestock
prices. Food price behavior was quite volatile in 1979. Over the year
these prices increased about 10 percent, moderately below the rise of
nearly 12 percent during 1978.

In December, the CPI was boosted once again by a large rise in
the homeownership cost component. Over the year, homeownership costs
contributed more than 1-1/2 percentage points and energy items 2-1/2
percentage points to the 4.3 percentage point acceleration in consumer
prices. There also was some acceleration in the rate of price increase
outside these sectors, notably for new cars and rents.
In December, the BLS released five experimental estimates of the
change in consumer prices (shown as 12-month percentage changes only)
which are based on alternative approaches to measuring changes in home-
ownership costs. These reflect both different price series and weighting
schemes and indicate increases in the total CPI during 1979 ranging from
10.8 to 13.2 percent, compared with the 13.3 percent rise in the published
CPI.
The recent surge in spot prices of precious metals contributed to
a significant rise in the December producer price index for intermediate
materials. Between mid-December and mid-January spot market prices of
gold and silver exploded--apparently associated with developments in the
Middle East--suggesting the possibility of further upward pressure in
intermediate materials prices. Large increases also have occurred in
prices of other nonferrous metals, such as copper, and in prices of
energy-related items such as chemicals and plastics.
Agricultural Developments
On January 4 the President announced that 1980 grain shipments
to the Soviet Union would be limited to 8 million metric tons, 17 million
tons less than the higher ceiling which had been approved earlier. The
administration has estimated, however, that grain exports would be

reduced by this embargo by only 14 million tons since some reselling of
grain to the Soviets by other countries is anticipated. In addition,
soybean exports to the U.S.S.R. are to be reduced by 1 million metric
tons.
To forestall possible sharp grain price reductions in response to
anticipated increased supply, the administration took several steps to
support these markets. On January 8, it announced an offer to purchase
wheat, corn, and soybeans previously contracted for sale to the Soviet
Union from grain exporters at original contract prices. In addition,
further actions were taken to encourage greater stockpiling of grain by
farmers through either the regular CCC loan program or through the
farmer-reserve program.
Trading in agricultural commodities was suspended for two days
following the announcement of the export embargo. Prices of grain then
declined sharply in the first two trading sessions following the
President's announcement. However, these prices began to recover as
the administration's intention to support farm prices at about pre-
embargo levels became more evident. As of late January, cash prices
for grain at terminal markets were at about the levels immediately
preceding the embargo. However, for corn the prospect of bulging
domestic inventories over the next year has pushed futures prices
somewhat below pre-embargo levels.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
In response to incoming data suggesting that economic activity may
be less weak than anticipated over the near term and to recent decisions
to step up defense spending, corporate and Treasury bond yields have
advanced another 50 to 80 basis points since the January meeting and are
currently at historic highs. Treasury bill rates, too, show net gains
(generally about 30 to 50 basis points) for the intermeeting period, while
private short-term rates are unchanged to up about 30 basis points. Short-
term interest rates remain about 1/2 to 1-1/2 percentage points below their
late October peak levels. In contrast to recent developments in other sec-
tors of the credit markets, municipal bond yields and primary mortgage
rates have remained essentially unchanged since early January.
The daily volatility of interest rates in the money market has sub-
sided since October, although such fluctuations still tend to be somewhat
larger than they were before October 6. Investor preferences for highly
liquid, low risk securities have remained strong. Spreads between Aaa-
rated corporate bonds and long-term Treasury securities, for example, are
now around 120 basis points, compared with third- and fourth-quarter
averages of 60 and 100 basis points, respectively.
Extending the uptrend that began in late October, equity prices have
risen appreciably further in January, and many of the broad measures of
stock prices are currently at all-time highs. The recent advances have
been led by higher share prices of energy-related firms and defense con-
tractors.

More complete data for the fourth quarter confirm a widespread
weakening in credit flows in the private sector. Short- and intermediate-
term business borrowing ws down sharply from earlier in the year, and a
reduction in long-term corporate security offerings more than offset a
slight rise in commercial mortgage formation. The pace of home mortgage
growth also dropped significantly in the fourth quarter, and consumer
installment credit grew more slowly. In contrast, borrowing by governmen-
tal units at all levels increased sharply in the fourth quarter and has
remained strong in January.
M-1 growth appears to have slowed to a 3-3/4 percent annual rate
in January, from a 5-1/2 percent annual rate in December, as growth appar-
ently continued to be depressed by the net rise of interest rates since
last summer as well as by the recent slowing of economic activity. Time
and savings deposit inflows to banks look stronger in January, and thus
M-2 may expand somewhat more rapidly this month than last. Deposit
growth at thrift institutions appears to have slowed somewhat further in
January.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The apparent slowing of M-1 growth in January is attributable to a
marked drop-off in the pace of demand deposit expansion. Currency growth,
on the other hand, rebounded sharply-after three months of relatively
weak expansion--to account for over one-half of the growth of M-1.
Expansion of the interest-bearing component of M-2 accelerated a
bit in January, reflecting moderation in both net withdrawals from sav-
ings deposits and runoffs of large time deposits included in M-2. At the
same time, growth of small time deposits has been sustained, apparently

the result of good consumer response to the new 2-1/2-year certificate--
as suggested by press reports--and a resumption of substantial sales of
6-month MMCs. Deposit growth at thrift institutions appears to have
weakened slightly in January from the rates of recent months. Growth is
likely to have been mainly in the form of time deposits with floating
rate ceilings, as sample data for early January suggest a rebound in MMC
flows and sizable S&L sales of the new 2-1/2-year certificate.
Investment by savers in nondeposit market instruments appears to
have increased in January. In just the first three weeks of the month,
the growth of money market mutual fund assets surpassed the record
increase for a full month. Noncompetitive tenders in the Treasury's
weekly bill auctions were also up strongly during this period.
After declining slightly in November, bank credit growth resumed
in December--albeit at a slow pace-and reports from large banks for early
January indicate a further pickup may be in process. A reduction in hold-
ings of Treasury obligations in December was more than offset by acqui-
sitions of other securities, mainly municipal bonds, and total investments
grew at a modest rate. Total loans also increased slowly over the month,
reflecting a modest rebound of business lending-following a slight Novem-
ber decline--and continued strong growth of real estate loans. The
January pickup of bank credit growth appears attributable mainly to an
acceleration of loan growth, particularly business loans.
With credit demands weak and core deposit growth somewhat stronger,
commercial banks reduced their managed liabilities by about $9 billion
in December. The bulk of the decline was in net borrowing from banks'
foreign affiliates; about one-quarter of this reduction appeared attrib-

utable to a decline in weekend Eurodollar activity undertaken to generate
cash items and thus reduce reserve requirements against net demand depos-
its. Banks also cut back on other nondeposit borrowing by about $1 bil-
lion on balance. On average during December, managed liabilities subject
to marginal reserve requirements dropped to about $3-1/4 billion-from
$5 billion in November--with member banks accounting for nearly all of
this total.
Business Sector Finance
The resumption in December of business loan expansion at banks (net
of bankers' acceptances held) is attributable entirely to large banks,
with loans by these banks to Shell Oil Company accounting for about three-
quarters of their total business loan expansion. Business loan growth
slowed at foreign-related institutions in December and turned slightly
negative at small banks.
The further sluggishness of bank business lending in December
appeared attributable mainly to continued weakness of business demands
for short- and intermediate-term credit associated with a reduced rate
of inventory accumulation. In addition, businesses shifted a larger
share of their borrowing into the commercial paper market, perhaps to
take advantage of the widening of the spread between paper rates and
bank prime rates.
Comparison of the August and November Surveys of Terms of Bank
Lending suggests that rates banks charged on small loans rose less over
this period than those charged on large loans. Thus, it appears small
businesses have not experienced the inordinate increase in cost of funds
at banks which some observers thought might occur.

Gross public offerings of corporate bonds increased to $2.2 billion
in January, seasonally adjusted, substantially above the reduced levels
for the previous two months. The heavier volume reflected continued large
offerings by public utilities and a resurgence of issues sold by financial
concerns (mainly finance companies). Public offerings of bonds by indus-
trial corporations also increased, but remained below last year's monthly
average. Larger industrial corporations apparently are still reluctant
to issue call-protected bonds at current unprecedented levels of interest
rates, even though aggregate balance sheet ratios point to a marked ero-
sion of liquidity.
Stock prices have climbed, on average, about 2 percent since the
January FOMC meeting, and trading volume has been extraordinarily heavy.
Most broadly based indexes of NYSE-listed issues are currently 2 to 3
percent above pre-October 6 levels, and the AMEX and NASDAQ indexes are
at their record highs. The major stock price indicators have posted
cumulative gains of 7 to 33 percent since late October, reflecting in
part sizable increases in share prices of firms dealing in metals, petro-
leum, and natural gas products and, more recently, of aerospace and mili-
tary hardware companies.
Government Debt Markets
The Treasury has issued an additional $4.4 billion of marketable
debt and $1.3 billion of nonmarketable debt in January. Slightly over
half of the marketable total was obtained by adding to regular weekly
and monthly bill auctions, a continuance of the increased fourth-quarter
emphasis on bill financing. The remainder was raised through a $1.5
billion sale of a 15-year bond and by adding to a 2-year note refunding.

Two DM-denominated note issues (maturities of 2-1/2 and 3-1/2 years) were
sold in the German money market in late January to raise $1.1 billion
equivalent, and this accounted for most of the nonmarketable issues sold
by the Treasury over the month.
Federally sponsored credit agencies are expected to borrow about
$1.7 billion in January, down substantially from the monthly average of
the fourth quarter. The Federal Farm Credit Banks are continuing to
raise money at last year's record pace, but borrowing by FHLB and FNMA
has slowed considerably. The FHLBs are expected to raise little, if any,
money this month. FNMA is expected to borrow only about $500 million
(seasonally adjusted), about $200 million less than its expected net
mortgage acquisitions; the difference will apparently be financed by
reductions in other assets. The substantial volume of mortgages pur-
chased by FNMA continues a trend that began in the fourth quarter and
reflects the rising differential between interest rates on FNMA's out-
standing commitments and current levels of mortgage rates.
Bond offerings by state and local governments dropped to $3 billion
in January (seasonally adjusted), about $1.2 billion below the fourth-
quarter monthly average. A sharp drop-off in hospital financing bonds
due to new restrictions on federal guarantees of such issues partly
explains this cutback. Single-family housing revenue bonds accounted for
about 30 percent of the total municipal bonds offered in January, up from
an average level of 13 percent in the fourth quarter.
Demand for tax-exempt securities has continued to be firm, and
offerings coming to market in January have been well received. Casualty
insurance companies and banks reportedly are acquiring municipal securi-

ties in volume; municipal bond funds also have been growing rapidly in
recent months. With offerings of tax-exempt issues down somewhat and
demand for such issues remaining strong, yields on municipal bonds have
remained unchanged in January in the face of the advances in corporate
and Treasury bond yields.
Mortgage Markets
The sharp tightening of conditions in home mortgage markets that
began in October continued through the end of the quarter. New mortgage
commitments made by S&Ls fell another 15 percent in December, following
a drop of 40 percent the previous month. Despite a sharp cutback in
mortgage acquisitions, the level of outstanding commitments at S&Ls
declined by 5 percent in December to $28 billion, the lowest level since
mid-1977. For the fourth quarter as a whole, net residential mortgage
lending by nonbank thrift institutions dropped by about one-fourth.
There are some signs that, within the primary market, the extreme
tautness of the home mortgage market that characterized the fourth
quarter may be easing, at least slightly, in January. A special FHLBB
survey of commitment policies at large S&Ls indicated that about 40 per-
cent of the 130 institutions contacted had liberalized their commitment
policies in some way during the first half of January. By mid-January,
12 of the large S&Ls were still not making any new commitments, but this
compares with 30 associations that had closed their commitment windows
in October after the System's actions. About three-fourths of the S&Ls
reported that the volume of new commitments in mid-January was substan-
tially smaller than a year earlier, a slightly lower proportion than
during the latter half of December.

Some large S&Ls (and banks) in California reportedly cut their
prime mortgage rates by 1/4 percentage point around mid-January. In
other sections of the country, however, such rates have been raised, and
thus the average rate paid in the Nation remains just below the record
high 12.90 percent level which prevailed throughout December.1 In the
secondary market for home mortgages, yields on GNMA-guaranteed securities
have stayed about in line with the rising yields on intermediate-term
Treasury issues. Average yields in the January 21 FNMA auctions of for-
ward purchase commitments increased markedly as the volume of bidding
picked up. The auction price for government-underwritten home loans
bearing the current 11-1/2 percent ceiling rate fell to 90.6, implying
deep discounts on loans originated in the primary markets.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit growth slowed to an annual rate of 7-1/2
percent in December, according to preliminary data, lowering the annual
rate of advance during the fourth quarter to about an 8-1/2 percent annual
rate. Growth in automobile credit in particular slowed markedly over the
quarter but the pace of advance in other types of consumer credit also
moderated.
Increasing problems with repayment of consumer loans became evident
during the third quarter, the latest period for which delinquency data
are available. The delinquency ratio for closed-end consumer installment

in the Southwest. This largely reflected a sharp rise in lending rates
in Texas which followed federal preemption of state usury laws enacted
near year-end. The FHLMC has attempted to produce a consistent rate
series unconstrained by usury limits, but rates in Texas had been
carried in the series at their 12 percent usury ceilings.

loans at comercial banks reached the highest level in four years, though
well below the record highs of 1974 and 1975, and the delinquency ratio
for bank credit card accounts moved up sharply to a new high in September.
The percentage of loans delinquent at major automobile finance companies
was little changed, however, after the pronounced rise during the second
quarter.
Home mortgage delinquencies, as reported to the Mortgage Bankers
Association, presented a mixed picture in the third quarter. The per-
centage of home mortgage loans delinquent 60 days or more was little
changed from the second quarter, but there was a large rise in 30-day
delinquencies that may presage increases to come in the critical 60-day-
and-over category. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board series on mortgage
loans delinquent 60 days and over increased somewhat in December after
having remained flat in October and November.

APPENDIX A
A REVISED METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE HIGH EMPLOYMENT BUDGET
As a result of a joint staff project by representatives of the
Board, CEA, OMB, Commerce, and Treasury, a new methodology for esti-
mating the high employment budget (HEB) has been adopted by these
agencies; it is introduced in this Greenbook as well as in the
Council's Economic Report.
The old and new methods differ markedly. The new method starts
with estimates of actual receipts and expenditures and then adds to
these actuals the calculated revenue and spending increments to actual
values that would occur as the gap between actual and potential GNP
is closed.1 In contrast, the previous method does not "build-up"
from actuals; rather it attempts to calculate directly the level of
high employment receipts and expenditures. Because of the difference
in approach, the new method has a number of advantages.
Since the new method adjusts to actual values, it avoids the
lack of consistency between the actual and high employment budget
sometimes found in the old method. In the latter this problem arose
because projections of high employment income shares and tax rates--
based largely on historical trends of income shares and tax rates--
were unlikely to incorporate fully the projected structural changes
in the economy that were embodied in forecasts of actual income
shares and effective tax rates. As a result of this inconsistent
use of information, projections of actual and high-employment
receipts would sometimes yield an implausible elasticity of receipts
with respect to changes in income between actual and potential GNP.
Such problems are avoided by the new approach, as forecasts of
high employment revenues are developed by projecting actual receipts--
which reflect new tax legislation and projected structural changes in
the economy--and then adding to these receipts the extra revenues that
would be collected if the gap between actual and high-employment GNP
were closed. Estimates of these additional revenues are based on the
historical behavior of income shares and effective tax rates over the
business cycle and on projected values for actual and potential GNP.
Thus, the additional revenues gained in closing the gap do not include
any particular projected structural changes, but high employment reve-
nues--the sum of these additional revenues and projected actual
receipts--do include the bulk of such structural changes. Because
of this, the implied elasticity of receipts with respect to changes
in income between actual and potential GNP is more plausible than
under the previous method.
1. The additions to actual values are derived from econometric equa-
tions. In the case of personal tax receipts, for example, the addi-
tional personal tax revenues associated with a closing of the gap are
calculated by applying an estimated 1.33 tax elasticity to the differ-
ence between an estimated value for high employment adjusted personal
income (based on an income share equation) and an estimated value for
actual adjusted personal income (based on the same income share equa-
tion).

Another advantage of the new method, on the receipts side, is
its relatively heavy use of actual receipts, while estimates of
variables like high employment GNP and income shares are only used
in the calculation of adjustments to actual values, or "gross-ups,"
not in the calculation of high employment receipts per se. In con-
trast, the prior method abstracted completely from actual receipts,
using only variables inherently difficult to estimate such as real
GNP, income shares, and effective tax rates, all evaluated at a
hypothetical high employment level of economic activity.
A comparison of the HEB estimates resulting from each method
for the forecast period are presented in table 1. In this comparison,
the two series are based on the same assumptions about income shares,
tax elasticities, and the economy. As can be seen, the levels of the
HEB using the new method tend to lie below those using the old method.
However, the changes tend to move together, providing essentially the
same impression about the direction or thrust of fiscal policy. Both
series indicate a substantial move toward fiscal restraint in the
coming two years. This restraint is due in large part to the imposi-
tion of the windfall profits tax, increase in social security taxes,
and the interaction of inflation with the progressive personal income
tax structure.
In addition to developing an improved approach for calculating
the HEB, much work has been done on improving estimates of its under-
lying components such as income shares, effective tax rates, and tax
elasticities. In addition, cyclical adjustments of expenditures have
been made for several federal expenditure programs in addition to
unemployment insurance. A brief technical description of this work
comprises the remainder of this Appendix.
Estimates of Income Shares
In the past, estimates of full employment income shares have
been based on an interpolation between share values in actual full
employment periods. In contrast, under the new approach each share
is specified as a linear function of time and current and lagged
values of the percentage GNP gap. Such equations--explaining the
shares of all major components of national income and also the
difference between GNP and national income--are then jointly esti-
mated. This estimating procedure guarantees that the shares sum to
100 percent of GNP and that the sum of the gaps between estimated
actual and high employment values for income components equals the
gap between actual and potential GNP. One important result revealed
by the analysis is that as the GNP gap is closed approximately 20
percent of the increased income is allocated to corporate profits
and 75 percent to compensation of employees.
1. The major components of national income explicitly considered are
wages and salaries, other forms of compensation, nonfarm proprietors'
income, farm proprietors' income, corporate profits, and rent plus
net interest.

Estimates of Tax Elasticities and Rates
Much effort was made to improve existing estimates of the per-
sonal income tax elasticities. An inter-period elasticity is used
in estimating actual personal receipts over time and captures the
effects on tax receipts of both inflationary and real income gains.
In contrast, an intra-period elasticity is used in calculating at a
point in time the extra revenues associated with a closing of the
gap between the estimated actual and high employment levels of
adjusted personal income. In order to control only the path of real
economic activity, closing of this gap is assumed to involve no
change in the price level; this means that the intra-period elasti-
city captures the effects on receipts of only real income gains due,
for example, to increases in employment, hours worked, and pro-
ductivity.
To estimate these elasticities both time series and cross-
sectional analyses were employed. The time series analyses related
personal tax receipts--adjusted for changes in the relevant tax law--
to adjusted personal income, with many functional forms and sample
periods tried. This analysis tended to support the 1.45 personal
income tax elasticity underlying past projections of actual receipts.
The cross-sectional analysis utilized the "tax-file model" of the
Department of the Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis. Analysis using
this model was performed for several years in the 1970s. It required
estimates of changes in both employment and the components of adjusted
personal income that would occur with a closing of the GNP gap. The
former was derived using the CEA's potential GNP model and the latter
from the analysis of income shares. Further, the model required esti-
mates of the productivity, income distribution, and filing status of
the extra employed persons, with the results of the exercise parti-
cularly sensitive to these factors. A final value of 1.33 was chosen
for the intra-period personal income tax elasticity.
The marginal corporate tax rate used in the calculation of the
additional corporate tax revenues gained in closing the gap was derived
using time series analysis. An equation was estimated relating federal
corporate profits tax receipts (net of Federal Reserve System profits)
to a profits tax base (adjusted for Federal Reserve System profits,
profits from the rest-of-the-world sector, and state and local cor-
porate tax payments) and the investment tax credit. The estimated
relation was very precise and implied a marginal corporate tax rate
around 40 percent in recent years.
Calculation of the additional contributions for social insurance
associated with closing the GNP gap involved an examination of the
disaggregated components of these contributions.1 This disaggregated
1. The disaggregated components were social security taxes excluding
those paid by the self-employed and railroad retirement taxes; social
security contributions by the self-employed; unemployment insurance
taxes; and other taxes (including federal employee retirement contribu-
tions, supplemental medical insurance premiums, veterans life insurance
payments, and workmen's compensation).

A-4
approach was thought important because social security taxes have
increased since the 1950s to a major fraction of total receipts.
The analysis involved estimation of separate tax bases and tax
elasticities for each category (except other taxes, which was assumed
to be noncyclical). The tax bases were derived from estimates of
income shares and the proportion of income generated by employees
covered by each program. The tax elasticities--capturing the sensi-
tivity of social insurance contributions to changes in earnings--were
computed as a weighted average of an employment elasticity (assumed
to be 1.0 as the gap closes) and an average wage elasticity (based
on simulations of the Social Security Administration revenue esti-
mating model). For example, the elasticity for social security taxes
with respect to wage increases (excluding those paid by the self-
employed) was around .80 in 1979, having increased from .60 in 1970
because of the sizable increase in the taxable earnings base relative
to average earnings over the period. As a result the weighted tax
elasticity has risen from around .80 to .90 over the same period,
where the weights were based on the proportion of the increase in
wages and salaries in closing the gap attributable to the associated
increase in average wages (due, for example, to gains in productivity
or hours) and employment.
Indirect business taxes are comprised of specific and ad valorem
excises, customs duties, and nontax accruals, with specific excise taxes
amounting to over half the total. Calculation of the responsiveness
of these taxes to changes in real GNP was based on commodity demand
studies. According to these studies, most of the taxes are on pro-
ducts for which demand is inelastic with respect to income, implying
that the elasticity of total indirect business taxes with respect to
real GNP is less than unity. Moreover, this elasticity has declined
from a value of .84 in 1955 to .63 at present due largely to the repeal
of many cyclically sensitive excise taxes, such as the automobile
excise tax.
Estimates of Expenditure Adjustments
In the past the only expenditure program adjusted for a closing
of the GNP gap and the associated reduction in the unemployment rate
was regular unemployment insurance benefits. Under the new method
cyclical adjustments have also been made for extended unemployment
insurance, food stamps, aid to families with dependent children, old
age and survivors insurance, disability insurance, medicaid,and vet-
erans benefits.
The adjustment for regular unemployment insurance benefits has
been reestimated on the basis of a regression equation relating total
benefits to the insured unemployment rate, labor force, and the size
1. Examples of such products are alcohol, tobacco, and fuel.

of average weekly benefits. The results suggest that regular benefits
rise around $2.5 billion for each 1 percentage point increase in the
unemployment rate. In addition, the cost of extended benefits is esti-
mated to rise smoothly to nearly 100 percent of regular benefits as the
unemployment rate rises to 7.5 percent. At rates above 7.5 percent,
the cost of extended benefits rises sharply to around twice the cost
of regular benefits since several state programs are then triggered into
operation. Estimates of the cyclical adjustments for the other expendi-
ture programs mentioned above are based on extensive analysis by many
government agencies on the cyclical sensitivity of these programs to
changes in the unemployment rate. Expenditures on these programs are
estimated to increase by around $1 billion for every percentage point
rise in the unemployment rate above the benchmark rate of 5.1 percent.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets
The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dollar is
slightly higher than its value at the end of 1979; the dollar declined
about 1 percent in the first week of January, but it has risen steadily
since to recoup its earlier losses. The political and economic uncer-
tainties arising from developments in Iran and Afghanistan continue
to dominate exchange markets, and rate movements in particular cur-
rencies have often been volatile. Some commodity markets have also
been affected, and the gold price skyrocketed to over $850 per ounce
at one point, but has since dropped back to around $700.
In foreign exchange markets the yen has shown the largest daily
fluctuations and has moved over a wide range, but it is currently
trading at its year-end level. The pound has experienced daily fluc-
tuations of nearly 1 percent during this period but has generally
moved higher to a level nearly 2 percent higher than at year-end.
The EMS currencies, including the mark, are generally about 1/2
percent lower than at year-end.

OPEC surpluses and investment flows in 1979. The OPEC current
account surplus is estimated to have risen from $7 billion in 1978 to
$65 billion in 1979 as a result of the steep increase in oil prices.
(A still larger surplus of about $110-115 billion is currently being
projected for 1980, in consequence of the further oil price increases in
late 1979 and early 1980.) OPEC oil revenues rose from $130 billion in
1978 to about $200 billion last year. OPEC imports, in contrast, rose
only about 4 percent in 1979, to an estimated $104 billion, the small
rise resulting from slower growth of economic activity and import demand
in some countries and from a precipitous drop in imports in Iran. The
OPEC deficit on net services and private transfers continued to widen
quite rapidly, but in absolute terms that rise was dwarfed by the
increase in oil revenues. The bulk of the current-account surplus was
concentrated in the second half of the year, in reflection of the
especially sharp oil price increases between April and July 1, and is
estimated to have run at a quarterly rate of around $20 billion in each
of the final two quarters.
OPEC external investment flows which can be identified amounted to
about $24-1/2 billion in the first three quarters of 1979, equal to
55 percent of the current account surplus in the same period. Reported
investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Eurocurrency
market, other bank deposits, and international organizations came to only
$3.7 billion in the first two quarters but increased to almost $21 bil-
lion in the third; a relatively small part of that increase can be
attributed to the lag in payments for oil exports. For the nine months,

additions to OPEC Eurocurrency deposits, as well as to domestic-currency
deposits outside the United States and United Kingdom, totaled close to
$23 billion, accounting for the great preponderance of the identified
investments and amounting to one-half of the surplus. Investments in
the United Kingdom came to $1.6 billion and those in the United States
to less than $1 billion (although third-quarter data are incomplete).
Following a net liquidation of their assets in the United States in the
first half of the year, the OPEC countries increased their holdings in
the United States by at least $3.5 billion in the four months July-
October. However, these increases were a rather modest share of the
total worldwide OPEC investment flows, and partial data for the rest of
the year do not suggest much if any pick-up in the share of total OPEC
investments flowing to the United States.

IV-7
U.S. International Transactions
The trade data for December are not yet available on an inter-
national accounts basis. On the census basis, the trade deficit for
the fourth quarter was about the same as the deficits in the second
and third quarters. For the year as a whole the deficit was down some-
what from 1978.
Petroleum imports rebounded to 8.9 mbd in December from 7.9 mbd
in November (including imports into the U.S. Virgin Islands). The
average for the fourth quarter, 8.7 mbd, was about the same as for the
second and third quarters. The price of imported oil climbed about 8
per cent in December, to approximately $25 per barrel. Since the mid-
December Caracas meetings, the only change in the OPEC price picture
has been the $2 per barrel increase, retroactive to January 1,
announced January 28 and 29 by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, U.A.E., Qatar
and Iraq. In contrast to official contract prices, spot prices have
been slipping. The gap between spot and contract prices has fallen to
the $3 to $8 per barrel range from the pre-Caracas range of $15 to $20
per barrel. The amount added to U.S. average import prices by spot
market purchases is likely to be smaller in January than in the fourth
quarter.
Agricultural exports are expected to total a record $37 billion
in 1980, despite the embargo on grain exports to the Soviet Union. The
embargo is expected to have several secondary repercussions, in addition
to the direct loss of export sales to the Soviet Union. There is likely
to be distress slaughter of Soviet livestock because of the lack of
replacements for U.S. feedgrains. This will reduce world demand for

IV-8
feedgrains for several years. On the other hand, the Soviets will have
little difficulty making up for the loss of U.S. wheat from other
sources. The volume of U.S. wheat exports is likely to drop by only a
fraction of the lost sales to the Soviet Union because slightly lower
prices will also encourage sales to other countries. The forecast for
agricultural exports for 1980 has been revised downwards by about $2
billion due to the embargo.
Turning to the capital accounts, the pattern of private and
official capital flows in November was similar to the pattern in October
and in the first half of 1979. Large net official outflows were
accompanied by large net private inflows.
Official reserve holdings of the G-10 countries and Switzerland
in the United States fell by almost $8 billion in November. Japan sold
dollars heavily to support the value of the yen. German holdings fell
sharply because the Bundesbank engaged in liquidity tightening foreign
exchange swaps with German commercial banks. In December and early
January several swaps originally designed to tighten liquidity matured
and new swaps were arranged to ease German money market conditions. As
a result German official holdings at the FRBNY went up again by about
the same amount.
In November, OPEC holdings of official reserve assets in the
United States increased by $1.9 billion; in October they had increased
$1.7 billion. The net increase in OPEC assets in the U.S. during these
months was only about half this size. The rest was the result of a
transfer of funds to the FRBNY from a special Treasury account.
U.S. reserve assets rose by $1.3 billion in November, chiefly
because of the Treasury's issue of mark-denominated notes. The sale of

Carter notes is also reflected in foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury
obligations in November. An additional $1.2 billion equivalent of DM
Carter notes were issued in January.
Private capital flows reported by banking offices in the United
States showed a net inflow of $3.9 billion in November. The net inflow
was more than accounted for by a reduction in banks' loans to unaffiliated
banking offices abroad. After October 6, the U.S. agencies and branches
of foreign banks ran down their loans to non-affiliated foreign banks
and probably made them instead from their offices outside the United
States. Partial data for December and early January indicate that this
process has now stopped.
U.S. banks reduced their net liabilities to affiliated foreign
offices by over $2 billion in November; partial data for member banks
indicated that net liabilities continued to decline in December. Thus
it appears that U.S. banks did not fund additional domestic credit
activities from related offshore branches in the fourth quarter. This
is in sharp contrast to the first three quarters of the year, when net
liabilities to foreign offices (Eurodollar borrowings) increased by $25
billion.
U.S. non-bank holdings of Eurodollar deposits reported by foreign
branches of U.S. banks have leveled off since August, after growing by
$10 billion in the first eight months of 1979. They totaled $28
billion at the end of November. Eurodollar CD holdings of open-ended
money-market mutual funds and short-term unit investment trusts con-
tinued to grow in December and January, reaching $8.3 billion by the
middle of the latter month.

IV-11
An informal survey of several brokerage houses indicates that net
foreign purchases of U.S. equities in the last two months of 1979 and
early 1980 may have been fairly substantial. Foreign buying appears
to have been strongly motivated by international political developments
and has not lagged behind the rise in U.S. stock market prices as it
frequently has in the past.

IV-12
Foreign economic developments. In most major foreign industrial
countries continued strength characterized economic activity during the
fourth quarter of 1979. Industrial production for October-November was
up in Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and Italy, although it fell in
Canada and in France. In Germany, preliminary official estimates show
real GNP growth of 5 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter and places
year-over-year growth for 1979 at 4.4 percent. These indicators
suggest that the momentum of economic growth leading into 1980 may be
greater than expected.
Inflation continued at a rapid pace in the major industrial
countries. Price increases accelerated in Germany and Japan at the end
of last year; in Italy, prices advanced sharply in January, reflecting
largely the pass-through of recent oil price hikes.
A notable development in 1979 was the sharp drop in the combined
merchandise trade surpluses of major foreign countries -for the six
major countries the trade surplus dropped from $46 billion in 1978 to an
estimated $4 billion in 1979. The higher price of imported oil was the
principal cause of the huge declines in trade balances for Japan,
Germany, and France, In Italy, increases in imports, as well as higher
oil prices, resulted in an enlarged deficit. Trade surpluses in 1979
also declined relative to 1978 levels in the United Kingdom, despite a
reduction in the degree of dependence on imported oil and in Canada,
where less than 10 percent of oil consumption is imported, In the
United Kingdom, appreciation of the pound earlier in the year and rising
real wages served to weaken non-oil exports and led to a significant
increase in imports, while a decline in auto exports to the United
States was a major item in the lower Canadian surplus.

IV-16
Individual country notes. In Japan, industrial production record-
ed a substantial increase in October-November compared with the two
previous months, suggesting that fourth quarter real growth may have
slackened very little from the 6-1/2 percent (a.r.) seen earlier in the
year.
The otherwise strong performance of the Japanese economy continues
to be plagued by high rates of inflation that have not been moderated so
far by tighter monetary policy in 1979. Wholesale prices recorded
another large advance in December (the second-largest monthly increase
in the past five years), and at year-end the WPI was more than 17 per-
cent above its level in December 1978. Consumer prices have also con-
tinued their recent strong rising trend, although the rate of increase
has been less dramatic; in the three months ending in January consumer
prices rose at about a 7 percent annual rate. In view of recent large
increases in the WPI, strong upward pressure on consumer prices is ex-
pected to continue in the current quarter, a development that could, if
realized, have an adverse impact on spring wage negotiations.
Price factors have dominated recent movements in Japan's external
accounts. The 1979 current-account registered a deficit of $8.6 billion
due mainly to higher oil import prices that contributed to a decline of
almost 30 percent in Japan's terms-of-trade during the year. The oil
import bill rose $10 billion in 1979. The 1979 trade surplus of $2 bil-
lion was $22.6 billion lower than in 1978.
In recently announced policy measures the Ohira government seems
prepared to continue in 1980 a moderate tightening of policy. The bud-
get for FY1980, which begins April 1, calls for only a 10 percent

Iv-17
nominal increase in general-account expenditures, roughly in line with
expected nominal GNP expansion, while the government's fiscal loan and
investment program will increase by only 8 percent. Both figures are
slightly below corresponding rates of increase in the FY1979 budget.
The authorities have also forecast a 10 percent rate of growth of M-2
in the current quarter, a one percentage point decline from the fourth-
quarter rate.
In Germany, industrial production for October-November rose rela-
tive to the preceeding two-month period. This was consistent with
strong GNP growth in the fourth quarter. However, the rate of unemploy-
ment, after having reached a five year low at 3.6 percent in September
through November, inched up to 3.7 percent in December.
Wholesale prices are currently 10 percent above their year-ago
level. In December the consumer price index was 5.7 percent over its
year earlier level.
Estimates are that the trade surplus for 1979 declined more than
$9 billion relative to its 1978 level; a change that is accounted for
by the 1979 increase in Germany's oil bill of $10 billion.
Economic activity in Italy in the fourth quarter maintained its
vigorous recovery from mid-year strikes. Industrial production in Octo-
ber-November averaged 10,5 percent higher than the July-August level.
The major source of strength appears to have been private domestic de-
mand, both in the form of business stockpiling as well as strong con-
sumer demand. Consumer spending may have been sustained by a growth of
disposable income brought about by last year's contract wage increases
and the more frequent indexation of government workers' salaries.

IV-18
Consumer price inflation in November-December decelerated from its
very high pace of the previous two months, although it still averaged
about 1.5 percent per month. However, early indications for January
point to an increase of 2.5 to 3 percent, reflecting to a major extent a
sharp rise in fuel prices. The government recently announced price in-
creases for a wide range of petroleum products as well as increases in
public utility charges.
In November the trade deficit (s.a.) jumped to $2 billion after
averaging $300 million per month in August-October. Imports rose sub-
stantially in value terms while export values dropped; these movements
may reflect the strength of fourth-quarter activity.
In the United Kingdom, higher industrial production in October and
November and a rise in the volume of retail sales above the level of the
third quarter suggest that the level of real output probably increased
in the final quarter of 1979. Anticipation of the strike currently under
way against the British Steel Corporation may have boosted fourth-quarter
growth.
Real GDP in France rose by an unexpectedly high 8 percent (s.a.a.r.)
in the third quarter. However, industrial production for October-Novem-
ber fell relative to the previous two months indicating that this high
rate of GDP growth probably did not continue in the fourth quarter,
On January 1, retail and wholesale price margins were decontrolled
on all goods except fresh food; industrial prices were freed in 1978 and
controls on service prices will be lifted in stages. However, the gov-
ernment has pledges from large store groups and other sectors to freeze
prices voluntarily for two to three months. Higher social security

IV- 19
rates were also introduced January 1. On January 2, the government
reacted to the year-end oil price increase -- the increased oil price
will be passed on immediately and will be reflected in electricity and
gas prices, while the impact on the lowest income recipients will be
offset by a special payment in late February. About $2 billion will be
made available in credits in 1980 for investments targeted for energy
conservation, exports, and employment creation; the amount is about one-
quarter of the estimated increase in the French oil bill.
Industrial production in Canada declined in both October and No-
vember -- indicating that the economy may have begun to slow during the
fourth quarter. However, unemployment dropped to 7.1 percent in December
after averaging 7.4 percent during the previous two months.
The merchandise trade balance (s.a.) increased in November to a
surplus of almost $450 million from about $300 million in October. The
increased surplus reflected a larger decline in imports than in exports,
which may be a consequence of weakening economic activity. For the first
11 months of 1979, the trade surplus (s.a.) was $2.8 billion compared
with a surplus of $3.3 billion for the comparable period in 1978. An in-
crease in the Canadian trade deficit with the United States in automo-
tive products in 1979 of more than $1.4 billion compared with 1978 levels
was a major item in the lower overall trade surplus,
On December 28, the Bank of Canada announced a new target range of
5 to 9 percent for the annual growth of M-1 from its average level in
the second quarter of 1979. The previous range was 6 to 10 percent from
a June 1978 base. On February 18, parliamentary elections will be held.

IV-20
The December CPI in Sweden was about 10 percent above its year-
earlier level, compared with a 6 percent increase over the 12-month
period ending in June. Most of the acceleration is attributable to in-
creases in energy prices and indirect taxes -- including higher taxes
on energy products.
The Swedish government recently proposed its 1980/81 budget in
which the growth rate of expenditures was halved, due to declines in
subsidies to industries and to a fall in the unemployment rate. Despite
the reduction in expenditure growth, the new budget deficit will be
equal to 10.5 percent of GNP, which is unchanged from the share of GNP
claimed last year.
The Danish government, confronted by a rate of inflation of about
10 percent during 1979, a persistent current-account deficit, and a for-
eign debt equal to 20 percent of GNP, proposed a tough incomes policy,
which was quickly compromised. It now appears that hourly wages in 1980
will rise by about 10 percent, equal to the increase in 1979. Some
progress was reported in the government's attempt to reduce the weight
of energy prices in the index to which wages are linked.
