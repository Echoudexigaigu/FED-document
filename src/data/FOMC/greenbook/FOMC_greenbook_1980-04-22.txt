The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
There now is clear evidence that economic activity has weakened
perceptibly. Employment dropped in March, and production and consumer
spending for goods fell in the past two months. In February, housing
activity declined further and growth of business capital spending and
inventory accumulation slowed. Rates of inflation remained exceptionally
high at both the producer and consumer levels, although there were
declines in a number of primary commodity prices.
Employment and Production
Labor demand slackened appreciably in March, as nonfarm payroll
employment was reduced 140,000. Payroll losses were concentrated in the
construction industry, but, more significantly, employment in the service-
producing sector--where the bulk of payroll growth has occurred over the
past year--was virtually unchanged. Scattered layoffs also occurred in
manufacturing, and the factory workweek was cut 0.2 hour in March to
39.8 hours--down half an hour from January.
Total employment, as measured by the household survey, also
declined substantially in March and the jobless rate rose to 6.2 per-
cent, the same as in January. The jobless rate for adult men--a cyclically
sensitive indicator--rose 0.3 percentage point to 3.9 percent. In
contrast, unemployment rates for adult women and teenagers were little
changed, remaining near the levels that have prevailed over the past
year.
The index of industrial production declined 0.8 percent in
March, after edging down 0.2 percent (revised) in February. Output
losses were widespread, with particularly large declines in production

of construction supplies and consumer durable goods--both in the home
goods and automotive products. Moreover, automobile manufacturers
have announced plans to reduce output about 10 percent further in
April. Production of nondurable consumer goods fell after four straight
months of growth, and output of business equipment--a source of strength
over the past year--was unchanged. Manufacturing capacity utilization
declined nearly 1 percentage point in March to a level 4 percentage
points less than a year earlier.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Consumer spending has weakened considerably in recent months
following the substantial growth in the last half of 1979, a develop-
ment associated with a drop in the saving rate to historically low
levels. Nominal retail sales fell 1.3 percent in March following a
downward-revised 1.6 percent drop in February. Excluding autos and
nonconsumption items, retail spending was little changed in March, as
furniture and grocery stores reported advances after registering declines
in February; however, sales by general merchandise stores declined
substantially for the second straight month.
Sales of domestic model automobiles were down in February and
March from January's pace. Sales weakened late in March, apparently
in part due to the ending of direct rebates to consumers by Ford and
General Motors and further tightening of credit markets, and picked up
only moderately early this month. Sales of imported models declined
about 1/2 million units (annual rate) in Macch--to some extent because
of inventory shortages--but were still at a high 2-1/2 million unit
annual rate.

Income growth in the first two months of this year decelerated
markedly from that in the fourth quarter--mainly the result of smaller
gains in wages and salaries and a drop in farm proprietors' income.
Total personal income rose at a 4 percent annual rate in February--down
sharply from the 10 percent rate of growth in January. However, the
deceleration in February was due almost entirely to the fact that the
special energy allowance paid to low income household in January was
not repeated; wage and salary gains were about the same in both months.
Despite the slowing of growth in pretax receipts, income after taxes
has continued to advance at about its fourth quarter rate because of
the extraordinarily large tax refunds this year.
Consumer pessimism increased further in March, according to
both the University of Michigan and the Conference Board surveys. The
Michigan Index of Sentiment plunged 10 points to the lowest level in
its 25-year history. The Conference Board Confidence Index dropped
more than 5 points in March and is now in the range reported late last
summer and during the 1974-75 recession. The March declines in both
indexes reflected growing concern about future economic conditinns, as
well as further weakening in the evaluation of current personal finan-
cial conditions.
Greater pessimism about personal financial conditions has been
emerging in both surveys over the part 2 to 3 years, and may reflect
both the slowing in real income growth that has occurred in this period
and a deterioration in consumer balance sheet positions which has left
households more vulnerable to income disruptions. Constant dollar

which expanded rapidly in the early part of the cyclical recovery, grew
at only a 2 percent rate from the end of 1976 to the end of 1978, while
real liabilities rose at a 7 percent rate. Consequently, by 1979 the
ratio of financial assets to liabilities was back down to near the low
level reached in late 1974, and consumer spending may be more vulnerable
to income disruption.
Residential Construction
Housing activity was weakening even before the additional
severe tightening in mortgage markets in March and early April. Total
private housing starts fell 6 percent in February to an annual rate of
1.3 million units; this was the lowest monthly pace since late 1975.
Newly-authorized permits also declined in February to a level 40 percent
below the recent quarterly peak in 1978-Q2. The reduction in total
starts was concentrated in the Northeast, but the drop in new building
permits was more widespread.
The decline in total housing starts in February masked diver-
gent swings in its components. Multifamily starts--which had fallen
markedly during the past several months--rose sharply, while single-
family starts declined 22 percent. Low rental vacancy rates and strength
in the condominium markets continued to support the multifamily sector,
but the February pace is unlikely to be sustained in the near term
in light of current financing costs. The drop in single-family starts
to a rate of 774,000 units brought activity in this sector to its
slowest pace since March 1975.
Sales of both new and existing homes also dropped in February.
Sales of existing units declined 7 percent in February to their lowest

pace in recent years, while the 10 percent fall in new-home purchases
left them about a third below the 1979-Q3 pace.
Business Fixed Investment
Growth of business fixed capital spending moderated in February
from the rapid January pace. Shipments of nondefense capital goods rose
1-1/2 percent in February--down from the 4 percent rise in January, and
sales of heavy trucks, which are normally fairly volatile, fell about
15 percent (50,000 units at an annual rate) in February. The value of
nonresidential construction put-in-place declined 2 percent after rising
more than 7 percent between November and January.
In addition, near-term commitments for spending on capital
equipment eased in February. New orders for nondefense capital goods
dropped 8-1/4 percent, after advancing 13-1/2 percent from October to
January. Although much of the weakness in bookings was in the non-
machinery component--chiefly made up of aircraft and parts--machinery
orders fell 4-1/2 percent. Nevertheless, the dollar volume of unfilled
orders remains high, and current dollar spending on equipment should be
fairly well maintained in the coming months if the backlog is not
eroded by heavy cancellations.
Inventory Investment
Inventory investment also moderated in February, as business
continued to keep stocks in line with sales. The book value of manufac-
turing and trade inventories rose at an annual rate of $35.6 billion in
February, about $14 billion less than the January rate. Despite the

The book value of retail trade inventories was little changed
in February, following a substantial liquidation in the preceding two
months. Department store inventories, which grew rapidly in the second
half of last year, declined for the second straight month. The value
of inventories in the automotive group--another area where imbalances
emerged last year--increased slightly in February, but the number of
cars in stock at auto dealers fell both in February and March to a
level more than 1/2 million units less than last summer's reading.
Wholesale trade inventories increased at a $3 billion annual rate in
February, down sharply from the pace in the previous month, with a
large decline in stocks of distributors of motor vehicles and parts
mainly responsible. Manufacturers' inventories rose at an annual rate
of $30 billion in February, well below January's record increase; stocks
of electrical machinery, aircraft, and chemicals continued to increase
rapidly. Some of the inventory accumulation in manufacturing probably
was related to the strength in orders for defense products and civilian
aircraft.
Federal Government Sector
Preliminary data for March indicate that the Federal govern-
ment budget was $27 billion in deficit (quarterly rate) during the first
quarter of 1980. A major portion of the fiscal year deficit usually is
recorded during the first calendar quarter because of the payment of
tax refunds; this year, refunds during the first quarter totaled $20
billion as compared to $13-1/2 billion in 1979-Q1. Strong growth in
defense outlays, increased Commodity Credit Corporation loans (not
including direct purchases of grain related to the Soviet embargo), and

the payment of low income energy assistance grants also contributed to
the large first quarter federal deficit.
In late March, the administration presented a revised budget
that calls for fiscal year 1980 spending of $569 billion and receipts
of $532 billion, yielding a deficit of $37 billion. For fiscal year
1981, the administration now proposes $612 billion in spending, down
$4 billion from the January figure. This reduction is the net result
of $17 billion in budget cuts, partially offset by $13 billion in
outlay increases due to changed economic assumptions and reestimates.
The cuts include $4 billion in deferrals of new programs and $9.4
billion from reductions in ongoing programs, such as revenue-sharing,
public service jobs, and savings from greater efficiency in defense
and other government agencies. Additional savings would be realized
from a proposal to modify the indexation of federal retirement and
food stamp programs.
For the revised fiscal year 1981 budget, receipts of $628
billion are now projected--up $28 billion from January. The revised
economic forecast accounts for nearly half of this increase. The
rest is expected to come from the recently imposed oil import fee and
the proposed withholding of taxes on dividends and interest income.
(Additional description of the administration's revised budget and
Congressional progress on the first concurrent budget resolution is
included in Appendix A.)
State and Local Government Sector
Activity in the state and local government sector appears to
have slowed amidst reduced growth in federal aid and developments in

II-18
the bond market. Preliminary data indicate that recent gains in employ-
ment have been small. Although March payrolls increased by 11,000,
reductions earlier in the year resulted in only a 7,000 gain in the first
quarter; this was off sharply from last year's average quarterly rise
of nearly 50,000. The slowdown in hiring reflected in part the continuing
reduction of funding for public service employment (PSE). PSE payrolls
were reduced by 6,000 on February--the sixth consecutive monthly decline.
Similarly, state and local investment outlays as measured by
the value of construction put-in-place dropped sharply in February--
down 7 percent or $3-1/2 billion in annual rate terms from the unseason-
ably strong January level but 8 percent above the December pace.
Construction activity was off in February in every category except
educational building, conservation, and development; the latter programs
are primarily funded by federal monies and are thus vulnerable to
proposed budget cuts.
Prices
Aggregate price measures advanced in the first quarter at a
considerably more rapid pace than during 1979. Consumer prices rose
1.4 percent in both January and February and producer prices of
finished goods increased at a monthly rate of about 1-1/2 percent in
each of the first three months of the year. Large advances in energy
prices continued to boost the indexes at all levels.
At the consumer level, food prices remained unchanged for the
second consecutive month in February. Although producer prices of
finished foods turned up in March, they declined at the farm level,
reflecting increased marketings.

Consumer energy prices accelerated further in February and
accounted for more than one-third of the overall increase in the CPI.
Gasoline price increases continued to dominate this component, reflec-
ting the passthrough of recent price hikes for imported crude oil as
well as the effects of decontrol of domestic production. Little relief
can be expected in this area in the near future, as the oil import fee
will add to the upward pressure on prices.
Price increases in other CPI components eased somewhat from the
January pace. Most of the deceleration at the retail level was concen-
trated among commodities, notably houses, used cars, and apparel. At
the producer level, the rise in prices of finished consumer goods less
food and energy slowed sharply in March. The major factor was the
large decline in prices of precious metal jewelry after the runup of
previous months.
Consumer service costs continued to advance at a rapid pace
in February. Sharp increases in mortgage rates have been a major
influence on homeownership costs for some time, and in view of recent
increases in mortgage commitment rates further upward pressure is
expected in coming months. Costs of medical and other services also
rose rapidly in February.
Prices of precious metals have had a major impact on producer
prices of intermediate goods in recent months. Commodity prices for
gold and silver skyrocketed until last January, with some spillover
effect on other commodities, notably copper. The subsequent declines
in metals prices were responsible for much of the March slowing in
producer prices for intermediate materials other than food and energy.

Since the March 11 PPI pricing date, near-term futures prices for silver
posted a spectacular decline; this was accompanied by substantial falls
for several other commodities. Despite some recent increases, mid-April
prices were well below those of March 11. These declines have been
attributed in part to sharply higher financing costs. In contrast to
primary commodity markets, inflationary pressures remain strong elsewhere.
For example, price hikes were recently announced for a number of major
products, including steel, aluminum, and automobiles.
Wages
Wages for nonfarm production workers, as measured by the index
of average hourly earnings, rose 1 percent in March. In the first
quarter, the index rose at a 9-1/2 percent annual rate, compared to an
8 percent increase during 1979. The acceleration probably reflects
some passthrough of recent rapid price increases, as well as the hike
in the minimum wage in January. Nonetheless, the rate of increase in
wages remains well below current consumer price inflation.
The President has accepted the recommendation of the Pay Advisory
Committee to establish a range of 7-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for allowable
increases in wages and private fringe benefits. Other developments in
the anti-inflation program include the adoption by the Council on Wage
and Price Stability (COWPS) of more extensive price reporting requirements
and the institution of procedures for the prenotification of price
increases. Also, COWPS has tightened its voluntary price guidelines
to delay certain allowable price increases. Previously, businesses could
take the entire final 1/4 of their two-year permitted price increases on
April 1; now firms are allowed only 1/8 of the two-year increase on
April 1 and are expected to defer the remainder until July 1.

APPENDIX A
Revisions of the Federal Budget for Fiscal Year 1981*
Overview
On March 31, 1980, President Carter made public the details of
his new budget for fiscal year 1981, part of the anti-inflation pro-
gram he announced two weeks earlier. The revised budget now projects
fiscal year 1981 receipts of $628 billion, up by $28 billion from the
January estimate. A revised economic outlook (mainly higher infla-
tion) and proposed new taxes (primarily a gasoline excise tax) account
for most of the rise. Outlays have been revised upward by $13 billion
mainly because of higher expected interest payments and defense costs.
This expenditure gain would be more than offset by $17 billion in
planned spending cuts. The proposed revenue-raising measures and
sharp spending cuts are expected to result in a $16 billion surplus
during fiscal year 1981, following a $36 billion deficit now pro-
jected for this year. (In January, the President had recommended a
budget with a $16 billion deficit for fiscal year 1981, and a $40
billion deficit for this year.)
Even this dramatic swing from deficit to surplus understates
considerably the degree of fiscal restraint now proposed by the
President. The high employment budget, which measures discretionary
changes in fiscal policy, is projected to shift toward surplus by
over $80 billion between fiscal years 1980 and 1981. Despite this
shift toward restraint, the combined deficit--unified plus off-budget--
is still expected to register a $2 billion deficit in fiscal year 1981
(see table 1), as heavy spending by the off-budget Federal Financing
Bank (mainly for rural electrification and disaster loans), more than
offsets the recommended surplus in the unified budget.
Economic Outlook
The administration continues to forecast a recession, but this
downturn now is expected to occur later in 1980 than was anticipated
in January. A slower recovery is projected for 1981. A comparison
of the January and March economic forecasts appears in table 2, which
shows that real GNP is now projected to drop--fourth quarter over
fourth quarter--by 0.4 percent during 1980, and to rise by 2.2 per-
cent during 1981. The new unemployment rate forecast is slightly
more optimistic than January's Budget. The most significant differ-
ence between the January and March forecasts is in the inflation rate.
As measured by the GNP implicit price deflator (from fourth quarter to
fourth quarter), the 1980 rate is projected at 10.4 percent (1.4 per-
cent higher than January prediction) and the 1981 rate at 9.1 percent
(0.5 percent higher).

Receipts
The administration now estimates that receipts will total $628
billion in fiscal year 1981 (up $28 billion from the January esti-
mate) and $532 billion during the current fiscal year (up $8 billion).
Stronger near-term economic activity and worsening inflation account
for $5 billion of the fiscal year 1980 rise and $12 billion of the
fiscal year 1981 increase. (See table 3.)
The President--using existing legislative authority--also has
imposed an import fee of $4.62 per barrel of crude oil, effective
March 15, 1980. The administration is expected to allocate supplies
and regulate oil prices through existing "entitlements" in order to
shift the burden of this fee from oil importers to gasoline users.
The administration also has proposed that the fee be replaced (later
this year) by an ad valorem gasoline tax. The gas tax would require
legislative action and would add $13 billion to fiscal year 1981
revenues.
The administration has recommended that the Congress pass
legislation to withhold taxes on dividend and interest payments.
This proposal would raise an estimated $3.4 billion in fiscal year
1981. One billion dollars of this revenue would result from in-
creased tax law compliance, since significant amounts of interest
and dividend incomes currently are not reported on tax returns.
The remaining $2.4 billion would result from the speedup in tax
payments that withholding would produce.
Thus, the administration now estimates that federal tax
receipts will grow by more than $95 billion, or 18 percent, between
fiscal years 1980 and 1981. Table 4 shows the components of this
increase, which pushes federal revenues to 22.4 percent of GNP--
the highest level ever.
Outlays
The new outlay estimates reflect the administration's revised
economic forecast, and the proposed $17 billion in spending cuts.
Higher interest rates and inflation are now expected to add $4
billion to fiscal year 1981 outlays. Technical reestimates for
other programs--mainly operations and maintenance in the Defense
Department--are projected to add another $9 billion in outlays for
fiscal year 1981. For the current fiscal year, upward revisions due
to economic conditions and reestimates are expected to add $8 billion
to the original January spending estimate. (See table 5.)
The President plans to offset this spending increase with
sharp reductions in numerous ongoing and proposed programs. Budget
cuts totaling $2.6 billion in fiscal year 1980 and $17.2 billion in
fiscal year 1981 would be achieved through such measures as: elim-
inating the state portion of general revenue sharing; reducing the

number of public service jobs; canceling countercyclical fiscal
assistance to cities; postponing energy research projects and oil
purchases for the strategic petroleum reserve; and adjusting federal
retirement benefits and food stamps only once a year instead of twice
a year as is currently done. Congressional approval will be required
for all of these budget cuts. If the Congress approves them, and the
$5.6 billion in legislative savings set forth earlier in the January
Budget, then federal outlay growth will be sharply curtailed--a pro-
jected 7.4 percent rise from 1980 to 1981, the smallest increase
since 1973, and clearly a decline in real terms.
Congressional Action
Both the House and the Senate Budget Committees have recently
endorsed a balanced budget for fiscal year 1981 (see table 6). The
Senate Budget Committee included in its revenue estimate the proceeds
of the recently imposed oil import fee, and recommended it be offset
by a $10 billion cut in personal income and business taxes. The House
Budget Committee, on the other hand, excluded from its revenue esti-
mate the $10-1/2 billion oil import fee, and suggested it be ear-
marked for later productivity-increasing personal and business tax
cuts. Both committees were firm in their resolve not to endorse a
tax cut for 1981 unless the budget is in balance.
The Federal Credit Budget
Finally, the President has expanded the scope of his proposed
federal credit budget, first announced in January. The administration
originally excluded federal housing agencies from the list of credit
activities subject to annual appropriations control. Bowing to pres-
sure from the Budget Committees, the administration now has decided
to include these agencies in the credit control budget. This action
would increase (from $15 billion to $45 billion) the amount of new
federally assisted credit subject to suggested appropriation limits
in fiscal year 1981.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates reached all-time highs in late March and early April.
However, with the monetary aggregates weakening and economic indicators
evidencing recessionary tendencies, financial markets have rallied, push-
ing yields on most fixed-income securities below their mid-March levels.
Credit conditions nonetheless remain taut. Many financial institutions
are experiencing significant liquidity and earnings pressures, and
investors are exhibiting a greater concern about safety and liquidity.
Deteriorating cash flows have compelled nonfinancial businesses
to maintain a substantial pace of external financing. These firms
have continued to react to high long-term rates by relying heavily on
floating-rate or shorter-term credit-especially commercial paper and
bank loans. Meanwhile, a diminution in investable funds of life insur-
ance companies has contributed to weakness in demand for corporate bonds.
High interest rates have continued to be a significant deterrent
to municipal bond issuance. However, sales of housing revenue bonds have
remained sizable as states and localities have attempted to offset the
impact of tight mortgage markets. The federal government has been an
active borrower in recent weeks, selling a large amount of short-term
debt to finance the pre-tax date deficit and to cover redemptions of
nonmarketable obligations.
In the household sector, high interest rates and reduced credit
availability likely have contributed to reductions in home mortgage and
consumer credit flows. Thrift institutions continue to suffer from dis-
intermediation and an earnings squeeze. The Board's recent actions
under the Credit Control Act have encouraged and aided consumer lenders

credit expansion.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M-1A contracted at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent in March, while
M-1B declined somewhat less owing to an expansion in other checkable
deposits. These two measures of transactions balances conceivably might
have been weaker still had there not been a relatively large volume of
tax refunds last month. For the first quarter as a whole, growth in
M-1A was at a 5-1/2 percent pace-in line with historical relationships
among money, income, and interest rates.
M-2 growth slowed to a 3-1/4 percent annual rate in March. Combined
savings and small time deposits at commercial banks continued to expand,
but at a reduced pace. At thrift institutions such deposits increased
slightly after having contracted in January and February. However, at
both sets of institutions outflows in March from fixed-ceiling deposits
remained sizable; only variable-ceiling accounts--including a record
increase in MMCs at S&Ls--exhibited any strength. Indeed, high market
rates have continued to prompt substantial premature withdrawals from
fixed-ceiling time accounts.
Contributing to the slowdown in M-2 during March was weakness in
money market mutual fund shares, which actually declined in recent weeks.
While slackening of MMMF growth was to be expected following the extra-
ordinary surge earlier in 1980, the recent decline undoubtedly resulted
in part from policies of many existing funds either to limit or to
refuse new share purchases until they devised a method to respond to the
new 15 percent marginal special deposit requirement. To attract new

accounts, many organizations have established so-called clone funds.
These funds are operationally similar to existing funds and can be
registered within as few as five to seven working days. As of April 4,
nine of the 24 registering clone funds had been authorized by the SEC.
Growth in total reserves rebounded in March to a 6-3/4 percent
annual rate, reflecting strong growth in small time deposits and inter-
bank demand deposits. Nonborrowed bank reserves declined for the second
consecutive month, but borrowing rose to $2.8 billion from $1.7 billion
in February. The high cost of funds at the discount window (16 percent
for banks incurring the frequent-borrower surcharge) may have added to
pressures in the federal funds market. Federal funds have traded at
rates near 19 percent in recent weeks--roughly 3 percentage points above
the weekly average level at the time of the March FOMC meeting. (The
rate to which reference is made is that for borrowings not subject to
the 10 percent marginal reserve requirement. Nonexempt federal funds
for the most part began trading at 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points under the
exempt rate, reflecting the more general exposure to marginal reserves
since mid-March.)
The growth of bank credit dropped off substantially in March to
3-3/4 percent at an annual rate. Holdings of Treasury securities were
marginally lower, and the rate at which banks acquired other securities
slowed considerably. Total loans increased at only a 4-1/4 percent rate,
with business loan growth decelerating sharply and increases in real estate
loans also slowing. Security loans declined for the sixth consecutive
month, as dealers apparently continued to pare inventories and as nonbank
sources of financing-particularly the RP market--became more attractive.

The moderation in credit growth during March allowed banks to
limit increases in their total managed liabilities and in the large-time
deposit component to less than those in the first two months of the year.
Nondeposit liabilities fell slightly on balance, with a decline in federal
funds and security RPs somewhat exceeding a pickup in Eurodollar borrowing.
The weakness in managed liabilities was particularly evident in the second
half of March, possibly in response to the Board's recent amendments to
its marginal reserves program.1
Business Finance
Shorter-term business credit flows remained relatively strong last
month, led by rapid growth of commercial paper. Outstanding commercial
paper of nonfinancial firms increased $2.2 billion in March--roughly twice
the pace of the past year. Although evidently increasing preferences by
investors for security and liquidity were associated with some widening
of quality spreads and difficulties in selling low-rated issues, the paper
market was utilized heavily by companies to defer long-term financing and
to avoid higher bank loan rates.
Business loans at commercial banks (net of bankers acceptances) grew
at an annual rate of 12-1/4 percent in March--a bit over half the pace
during the first two months of the year. The increase of the commercial
bank prime rate to 20 percent was probably a factor in the reduced growth.
1. Effective the statement week ending March 26, there was a reduction of
at least 7 percent in the base for calculating marginal reserve require-
ments and an increase in the requirement on the excess of covered managed
liabilities over the base, to 10 percent for member banks and foreign bank
families. In addition, the Board imposed a special deposit requirement
of 10 percent on increases in managed liabilities of nonmember banks. At
member banks and branches and agencies of foreign banks, managed liabili-
ties subject to marginal reserve requirements averaged $20-1/2 billion in
the statement week ending March 26, up from $6 billion in the previous week.

Between the beginning of the year and mid-March, the markup of the prime
rate over CD rates had deteriorated sharply, from nearly 2 percentage
points to only a few basis points. The imposition of higher marginal
reserve requirements in March added to the effective cost of CD funds at
many banks. With the recent increases in the prime rate, the customary
spread over the CD rate has been reestablished and, in fact, widened a
bit.
Apart from cost considerations, stringent lending policies have
been encouraged by both the Board's voluntary credit restraint guidelines
and the massive volume of loan commitments outstanding. Unused business
loan commitments at sampled large commercial banks rose by $11 billion
(seasonally adjusted) in February-more than the combined increases of
the three previous months. This apparently resulted from businesses'
attempts to secure such agreements in anticipation of credit controls.
Reduced availability of bankers acceptance financing may also be
adding to business credit stringency. Acceptances outstanding grew
rapidly in 1979 and in early 1980, reaching $52.3 billion at the end of
January. However, many large bank issuers have reached a level of
acceptances outstanding close to their permissible limits. As a result,
some banks apparently have now temporarily suspended the issuance of
acceptances.
Business credit at finance companies fell $200 million in February
(see table on page 111-9). A decline in dealer inventories caused the
wholesale automotive category to drop by $500 million. The weakness in
March of commercial paper issuance by finance companies-along with fur-
ther auto stock reductions--suggests that sluggish business lending by
these institutions continued last month.

III-11
Gross public offerings of corporate notes and bonds remained on the
light side in March, edging up to only $1.7 billion. Furthermore, private
placements of corporate bonds likely continued at a low level. Investable
funds at life insurance companies-the primary purchasers in the private
placement market--have been curtailed by a surge in policy loans and by a
lower than expected pace of contributions to insurer-managed pension fund
accounts. With total mortgage commitments outstanding close to a record
level, the latest available data (January) indicate a very sharp reduc-
tion by life companies in all types of loan commitments (see chart on
page 111-13). In fact, recent liquidity pressures have led several life
companies to issue commercial paper, and others to draw on previously
established bank lines of credit.
Aaa-rated corporate bond yields are currently well below their
levels at the time of the March FOMC meeting, but yields on lower-rated
obligations have declined by a smaller amount as investors have become
more quality conscious. For example, the rate spread between newly
issued A- and Aaa-rated utility bonds is currently about 150 basis
points-up from 125 basis points in mid-March.
Stock prices continued to fall sharply in late March, but these
declines were partially retraced in early April. On balance, major stock
price indexes are 1 to 4 percent below their levels at the time of the
March FOMC meeting. The volume of new equity issues has remained large,
with the increase from last year's pace largely reflecting a pickup in
industrial offerings. Since the amount of stock retired through mergers
appears to have fallen off sharply, net stock issuance probably has
increased even more markedly than gross offerings.

Government Debt Markets
The Treasury borrowed heavily in the market during March, since
the first-quarter budget deficit was larger than expected and there were
substantial redemptions of nonmarketable debt. Of the $19.3 billion (not
seasonally adjusted) raised in the market by the Treasury in March, $16
billion was through cash management bills and another $2-1/2 billion in
regular bill auctions. By the April FOMC meeting, $9 billion of addi-
tional new cash likely will be raised in sales of marketable debt.
Noncompetitive tenders have assumed unprecedented importance in
recent Treasury auctions. During the first quarter, noncompetitive ten-
ders totaled more than $22 billion-about $3 billion above the record
pace of the last quarter of 1979. Such tenders were especially heavy in
regular weekly bill auctions, where investors were attracted by the com-
bination of high yields, safety, and liquidity.
Federally sponsored credit agencies borrowed $5.2 billion in
March--more than double the monthly average for January and February.
FHLBs raised about $2.3 billion, and FNMA borrowed $1.6 billion. (FNMA
raised another $500 million in early April debenture offerings.) Federal
Farm Credit Banks borrowed $1.3 billion during March-also primarily to
finance mortgage lending activity; this rate was well above 1979's record
average monthly pace. Total sponsored agency borrowing for the first
quarter was $9.2 billion, exceeding the previous record of $8 billion set
in the final quarter of last year.
Gross issuance of tax-exempt bonds slowed to about $2.5 billion
in March-nearly $400 million below February's relatively low volume.
Sharp increases in interest rates undoubtedly contributed to the further

III-16
slackening. At these high rates, states and localities were unable--or
unwilling--to issue 45 scheduled offerings totaling $800 million during
March. Postponements during February and March together were about as
large as in the three months following the Board's October 6 action.
Although state interest rate limitations on municipal securities report-
edly were responsible for half of the deferrals in March, the seven post-
ponements attributed to unstable market conditions accounted for more
than 60 percent of the dollar volume displaced. The volume of housing
revenue bonds issued in March, however, was only slightly below that of
February. In fact, single-family mortgage financing through the tax-
exempt bond market increased, presumably reflecting the liberal transition
rules included in the House-passed version of the bill dealing with such
bonds.1
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates in mortgage markets stabilized or eased somewhat in
mid-April, after establishing record highs earlier in the intermeeting
period. In the primary market for conventional loans, average rates on
new commitments remained over 16 percent in the week ended April 11--3-1/2
percentage points above the level in mid-February. Rates continued to be
highest in the West (at 17 percent), but they averaged at least 16 percent
1. On March 26, the House passed legislation allowing restricted use
of single-family revenue bonds, but only for two years according to
a "sunset" clause. At the end of two years, the use of tax-exempt
mortgage bonds must again be approved. The general transition rule
would allow state housing agencies to issue $150 million of mortgage
bonds minus any bonds already marketed under this rule, and would permit
local authorities to issue mortgage bonds totaling the greater of $35
million or $50 per person. In both cases, mortgage commitments would
have to be made by January 1, 1981. A special transition rule was
approved that could result in the issuance of an estimated $800 million
of mortgage revenue bonds by Kansas localities.

in all regions of the country.1 Yields on purchase commitments for con-
ventional home mortgages in the FNMA and FHLMC auctions have declined
noticeably during recent weeks.
Market yields for government-underwritten loans also have turned
down. Yields on FHA/VA loans, originated primarily by mortgage companies,
have been determined largely by competitive pressures in GNMA-guaranteed
security markets. For many investors these instruments are substitutes
for Treasury and agency securities, on which yields have eased of late.
In view of record market rates and substantial discount points being paid
in early April, the Administration raised the ceiling rate for FHA/VA
home loans a full percentage point to 14 percent.
With conventional home mortgage rates remaining high at the same
time that yields on corporate bonds fell, the spread between mortgage and
corporate bond yields has widened to record levels. However, institutions
that ordinarily are most sensitive to this spread have been strapped for
investable funds and, consequently, have apparently not channeled addi-
tional money into mortgage markets. Mutual savings banks, on balance,
lost deposits during the first quarter. Further, cash flow difficulties
have discouraged new commitments for mortgage lending by life insurance
companies. At life insurance companies, seasonally adjusted commitments
outstanding to acquire all types of home mortgages--which peaked at $3.2
billion last September--had declined to $1.9 billion by the end of
January.
1. Under provisions of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and
Monetary Control Act of 1980, usury ceilings on most residential
mortgages have been eliminated unless a state adopts a new usury limit
prior to April 1983.

III-19
Other traditional suppliers of conventional mortgage credit also
have shown signs of retrenchment. A special Federal Reserve Bank survey
of 239 commercial banks ordinarily active in the residential mortgage
market indicated that only three-fourths were still offering commitments
for long-term home mortgages in mid-March. At savings and loans, mort-
gage commitments outstanding declined only slightly further in February
as both new commitments and net mortgage acquisitions increased. However,
new commitments likely fell sharply in March as deposit flows continued
weak. According to biweekly FHLBB surveys of more than 120 large S&Ls,
almost three-fourths of the associations tightened their commitment
policies during the first half of March-in most cases by increasing
mortgage rates charged. More than 50 percent of respondents reported
additional tightening in the final two weeks of the month.
Reflecting cash flow pressures, thrift institutions borrowed heavily
in March. Net advances by Federal Home Loan Banks totaled a record $3.6
billion last month. Some of this borrowing may have replaced issuance
of commercial paper and large CDs. A few S&Ls recently suffered down-
gradings of their commercial paper, and outstanding S&L paper fell $300
million during the first quarter as a whole. Investors took a similarly
negative view of savings and loan CDs. With the relative cost of such
funds rising, S&Ls increased outstanding CDs by much less in March than
earlier in the year. While the ratio of FHLB advances to total S&L assets
is about equal to the peak reached in 1974, reliance on other borrowings
has increased significantly since the last interest rate cycle. Mean-
while S&L holdings of liquid assets have remained relatively large as
institutions hedged some of their MMC liabilities; in February, the
liquidity ratio of all insured associations actually rose slightly.

To provide relief for S&Ls facing poor deposit flows and earnings
difficulties, the FHLB System has recently taken several actions in addi-
tion to making substantial advances. These actions include lowering the
minimum liquidity requirements, increasing and accelerating dividends paid
to S&Ls on FHLB stock, and permitting federal S&Ls to offer "rollover"
mortgages. In addition, a special program has been announced for subsi-
dized advances to institutions experiencing severe difficulties.
Consumer Credit
The combination of the high cost of funds and statutory ceilings on
finance rates clearly is discouraging consumer lending. The Board's
March 14 credit restraint program has served to reinforce incentives for
lenders to reduce consumer credit growth and made it politically and com-
petitively easier to take tightening actions. Reports suggest that recent
moves have been effective; many lenders have imposed measures ranging from
stricter credit standards to higher fees on credit card accounts.1
Installment credit growth in February (the latest available data)
rebounded to 9 percent from a much-reduced 5-1/4 percent pace in both
December and January. However, the increase in outstandings resulted from
a decline in liquidations of existing debt as well as a moderate increase
in extensions. Finance companies-especially the subsidiaries of the auto
makers--were the most active suppliers of consumer credit, accounting for
60 percent of the total expansion. Consumer credit contracted at credit
unions for the fifth consecutive month. Growth of revolving credit
(credit card accounts and bank overdraft credit) rose somewhat from
1. An appendix summarizes some of the actions that lenders have taken
to curtail credit growth and to bolster revenues.

most months during 1979.
Personal bankruptcies in the first quarter of 1980 rose to a level

three quarters of 1979.

APPENDIX A*
RECENT CONSUMER LENDING POLICY CHANGES
Following the announcement on March 14 of the Board's program of
restraint on certain types of consumer credit, a large number of creditors
have announced changes in lending policies and credit terms. This appendix
summarizes actions that have been reported by the press and trade sources.
It is also noted that restrictive tendencies already had become prevalent
prior to announcement of the Board's program.
Since March 14, a number of commercial banks, retailers, finance
companies, and certain other lenders have moved to limit the expansion of
consumer credit.1 Profits of creditors have been placed under increasing
pressure as costs of funds have escalated while finance rates have become
constrained by statutory ceilings in a growing number of states. The
Board's 15 percent special deposit requirement on covered credit in excess
of base period amounts has further diminished prospects for profitable
consumer lending.
The most frequent policy response among commercial banks has been to
confine approval of new credit cards and certain kinds of loans to estab-
lished customers, usually defined as those with specified deposit rela-
tionships. Ranking next in frequency have been reductions in the maximum
amount of loans, overdraft credit lines, or credit card cash advances.
Also often mentioned have been increasing minimum monthly payments on bank
credit card accounts; limiting or eliminating credit line increases on
existing accounts; raising credit standards for new loans or revolving
credit accounts; imposing stricter policies in dealing with delinquent
borrowers and with balances that exceed credit limits; and rejecting all
new credit card accounts and applications for certain types of loans.
A number of banks have reduced advertising and other solicitations.
In a few cases, existing credit card accounts have been cancelled on the
basis of risk or geographic criteria. Some banks have refused to grant
new credit cards or overdraft credit lines to customers who already hold
one or more bank revolving credit accounts.
Meanwhile, some retail firms have increased minimum monthly repay-
ments on open-end credit accounts, reduced new account solicitations, and
raised the size of the minimum purchase that can be charged to a revolving
1. The Board's action on April 2 required that 30-day's notice be given
of changes in certain credit terms on open-end credit accounts, and that
account holders be allowed to repay outstanding debt in accord with the
original terms of their contract. Since some creditors may have to revise
their disclosures in order to comply with these additional requirements,
some changes in credit terms and loan policies announced in the period
between March 14 and April 2 could be altered.

Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

credit account. Responses evidently have been more limited in number and
scope for retailers than for banks, possibly because retailers are reluc-
tant to alter credit arrangements that have proven satisfactory to their
customers or because part of the costs of retailer credit services may be
recouped through higher prices on some kinds of merchandise.
Three nationwide personal finance company chains are closing many
of their offices in states where rate ceilings have become especially
restrictive. A financing subsidiary of a major auto manufacturer indi-
cated that that its credit standards have been tightened and that larger
downpayments are being required from marginally qualified buyers.
Besides directly curtailing the volume of lending, many creditors
have taken steps on the pricing side, both to limit growth in credit out-
standing and to offset higher expenses and the prospective effects of the
special deposit requirement. The most frequent action by commercial banks,
where permitted by state law, has been to impose annual membership fees or
initial charges for cash advances. Some banks have raised finance rates,
instituted penalty fees for late payments or for exceeding credit lines,
or have begun applying finance charges from the date of purchase rather
than from the date of billing. One institution has established a trans-
action fee for each credit purchase or cash advance. Several banks have
increased discount fees charged to process credit card receivables of
merchants, while one bank has begun charging each retailer an annual fee
in addition to the merchant discount. One retailer has raised its finance
rates in several states where they were below statutory ceilings. Also,
a major gasoline company has decided to apply finance charges from the
date of purchase, and another is introducing a discount fee to be paid by
dealers on certain kinds of credit card sales.
The availability of consumer credit had been under pressure well
before mid-March, as costs of loanable funds rose above statutory rate
ceilings in a growing number of states. Many of the restrictive actions
noted at that time resemble measures announced in recent days. Research
directors at the district Federal Reserve Banks reported early last
November a broad tightening-apparent in all districts-in price and non-
price terms on consumer credit at various types of creditors. The Survey
of Senior Bank Loan Officer Opinion, taken in mid-November, showed a sharp
decrease in bank willingness to make consumer installment loans during the
preceding three months. This restrictive tendency continued through mid-
February, according to the survey taken at that time. Trade reports and
news coverage for the period prior to March 14 also document a decline in
the availability of consumer credit.
Furthermore, a sharp decrease in automobile installment credit
availability has been noted recently in many areas. Major "captive"
automobile finance companies and some commercial banks have attributed
increased demand for auto loans at their institutions to a widespread
withdrawal from the market of certain banks and other lenders. Although
the Board's expectation that commercial banks will hold the growth of
their aggregate lending during 1980 at 6 to 9 percent may have exerted

A-3
some indirect impact, restrictions on the supply of auto credit mainly
have reflected a profitability squeeze, since secured auto credit is
exempted from the consumer credit restraint program.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets. The strong demand for dollars that emerged
in late February and early March became even more buoyant after the
March 14 announcement of new U.S. credit restraint measures. With
the U.S. prime rate moving up from around 18-1/4 percent at mid-
March to 20 percent in early April and Eurodollar rates also jumping
to almost this level, dollar assets became attractive to foreign
currency holders and maintaining short positions against the dollar
became very costly. As illustrated in the chart, from mid-March
through the first week in April the dollar's weighted average exchange
value rose steadily and sometimes, on individual days, sharply.
Between the time of the last green book on March 12 and the Easter
weekend in early April, the dollar's average value rose by 6-1/2
percent. Gains were scored against all the major foreign currencies,
including a 9 percent rise against the German mark, with the dollar
reaching the DM 1.98 level. Against the yen, the dollar hovered
for some time below the Y 250 level with intervention support for
the yen from U.S. authorities, but later the dollar
broke through to as high as Y 261 in early April, for a gain of
5-1/2 percent.

.In the period from mid-March through the first week
of April, the Desk purchased a total of $1.7 billion equivalent
of foreign currencies, mostly marks
As the dollar rose in late March, the German mark weakened
relatively more than other currencies in the EMS arrangement and
the mark dropped close to its 2-1/4 percent intervention margin
against the French franc,
.The
Belgian franc also was near the bottom of the EMS currency band
.
Early in Arpil exchange market attitudes toward the dollar
became somewhat wary, and some participants came to expect a
retrenchment after the earlier runup. Statements by former Bundes-
bank President Emminger that the appropriate value for the dollar
was around DM 1.70 reinforced this view. Further, increasing numbers
of participants came to believe that U.S. interest rates were
either at or very close to their peaks. As signs loomed of an
impending U.S. recession, it was felt that rates would soon decline.
There was also an expectation that the Bundesbank would raise the
German discount rate at its April 10 meeting. In addition, unsettling

IV-4
political factors reemerged after the Easter weekend with the U.S.
diplomatic break with Iran, explusion of Iranian officials and
increasing hostilities between Iran and Iraq.
By the second week of April, sentiment had deteriorated
sufficiently that the dollar came under sharp and widespread sell-
ing pressure. During the week, trading in turbulent and sometimes
disorderly conditions, the dollar dropped precipitously by more
than 4 percent, giving up 5 percent against the mark and 2-1/2
percent against the Japanese yen. There were frequent reports
of large-scale dollar sales by Middle East interests to purchase
European currencies, especially the French franc, which remained
the strongest of the EMS currencies.
The Desk's intervention support for the dollar was on a larger
scale. During the second week of April, the Desk made net sales
of foreign currencies equivalent to $766 million, mainly marks but
also lesser amounts of Swiss and French francs. Financing of the
intervention sales of marks was shared by the System and the
Treasury. The System's share initially came from previously
accumulated balances, but subsequently the System made renewed
drawings on the Bundesbank swap line. The relatively small
sales of Swiss francs were covered from System balances, and the

IV-5
French franc sales, amounting to $47 million equivalent, were financed
by drawing (for the first time since the second quarter of 1975)
on the swap arrangement with the Bank of France.
Early in the third week of April, selling pressure on the
dollar abated temporarily;
the Desk purchaed $24 million equiva-
lent of marks to repay System swap debt. However on April 16,
substantial downward pressure on the dollar resumed following the
announcement by Chase Manhattan Bank of a reduction in its prime
rate from 20 percent to 19-3/4 percent. The Desk entered the
market to counter this pressure by selling $35 million equivalent
of marks and $2 million equivalent of French francs.
On balance over the five week period since the last green
book, the dollar's weighted average value rose about 2-1/2 percent;
against the German mark the net rise was 3-1/2 percent.
.The Desk purchased, net,
close to $1 billion equivalent of foreign currencies, of which more
than $800 million equivalent were German marks, mainly for Treasury
account. As a result of these developments, System swap debt with
the Bundesbank now stands at $204 million equivalent, and that with
the Bank of France at $49 million equivalent. The System's overall
open position in foreign currencies stands at $775 million equiva-
lent.

Gold prices oscillated between $500 and $560 for most of

the mid-point of this range.

Foreign claims of U.S.-chartered banks. Claims on foreigners held
by domestic offices and foreign branches of U.S. banks rose $29 billion
(10.5 percent) in the second half of 1979, compared with $18 billion
(7.7 percent) in the second half of 1978. This acceleration in the rate
of net lending occurred in claims on both international financial centers
(G-10 countries and offshore centers) and other areas of the world, in-
cluding non-oil developing countries. Because of the slowing in net
lending that had occurred in the first half of 1979, the 14-1/2 percent
increase in claims in the year ending December 1979 was close to the
15 percent rise in the previous year adjusted for the mid-1978 change in
reporting procedures (see note to table). Both these rates of increase
were considerably below the pace of lending in 1976-77.
Contrary to the pattern of the preceding three years, total claims
increased less in the fourth quarter of last year ($10-1/2 billion) than
in the third ($18-1/2 billion). As was reported in the green book last
month, events in the fourth quarter made lenders more cautious, and
beginning in November there was a sharp contraction in the amount of new
medium-term Eurocurrency loans announced. To some degree the slowing in
U.S. bank net lending in the fourth quarter, based on changes in actual
outstanding claims, may have reflected some of the same forces, including
the Federal Reserve actions of October 6 and developments in U.S.-Iranian
relations. The continued low level of announcements of new medium-term
Eurocurrency loans in the first quarter of 1980 suggests that actual
international lending in the first quarter may well show a considerable
decline from the comparable 1979 level, although there are a number of
differences between these two measures of international bank activity.

General note: Beginning in June 1978, customer claims and foreign cur-
rency claims are excluded. These amounted to $10 billion in June 1978,
$11.8 billion in December 1978.
U.S. banks' claims on countries other than international financial
centers rose 9-1/2 percent ($10 billion) in the second half of 1979, com-
pared with an increase of less than 8 percent a year earlier. However,
in this case too the fourth quarter showed a deceleration in net lending,
relative to the third quarter, rather than the usual acceleration. Claims
on oil-exporting countries were almost unchanged during the second half
of 1979, reflecting the greatly enlarged external surplus of those coun-
tries, but claims on all the other groups showed somewhat larger increases

IV-9
in the second half of 1979 than a year earlier. Among the non-oil
developing countries, Brazil increased its debts to U.S. banks by less
than a year earlier, but for most of the other countries the reverse was
true. This was notably the case as regards Mexico. After declining
throughout most of 1978 (from a peak in September 1977), U.S. bank
claims on Mexico rose slightly in the first half of 1979 and more rapidly
in the second half. Claims on Argentina, Korea and the Philippines also
rose more in the second half of 1979 than in the comparable period of
1978.

IV-10
U.S. International Transactions
During the first two months of 1980 the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit increased substantially to an annual rate of $58 billion
(international accounts basis), nearly $25 billion larger than the rate
in the fourth quarter. Imports grew about three times faster than
exports. Both imports and exports appear to have been affected by the
January/February run-up in commodity prices, which has since been
reversed.
The rise in nonpetroleum imports in January/February was spread
over most commodity categories, particularly industrial supplies,
capital goods, foreign cars, and other consumer goods. About one
quarter of the increase was related to high import prices for non-
ferrous metals. Another one quarter may be attributed to unusual
seasonal factors which should not persist in coming months. Steel
imports returned to the third-quarter 1979 rate, after falling by five

percent in the fourth quarter. Although strong foreign car sales in
January and February resulted in an additional draw-down of already
low dealers' inventories, there are indications that various foreign
manufacturers do not plan to increase further their shipments to the
United States at this time, perhaps because of sensitivity about
possible action to protect U.S. manufacturers.
Oil imports rose by $11-1/2 billion (annual rate) in January/
February from the fourth-quarter level. Sharply higher prices accounted
for most of the increase. Even so, the price of February oil imports
of $28.34 per barrel was still below the current level of world market
prices; prices of March imports may be as much as 5 per cent higher.
Import volume will likely drop from the January/February rate of 8.9
million barrels per day as winter demand tapers off (oil import data
are not seasonally adjusted) and as consumption declines with higher
prices and the slowdown in economic activity.
Nonagricultural exports rose by 6 per cent in January/February
over the fourth-quarter rate. Much of the increase appears to have
been in association with shipments of nonferrous metals other than gold.
The rise in silver prices early this year also contributed to the sharp
increase in the value of numismatic coin exports (recorded as consumer
goods). Exports of other industrial supplies and consumer goods also
increased, along with civilian aircraft and machinery. Shipments of
automotive parts for assembly in Canada declined, reflecting the weak
U.S. market for larger cars. The value of gold exports dropped off
sharply from the fourth quarter. (The U.S. Treasury has not sold gold
since November.)

Agricultural exports averaged $41 billion (annual rate) in
January and February, slightly below the record level in the fourth
quarter. Shipments of wheat and feedgrains declined. However, the
decline was less than anticipated in the wake of the embargo of ship-
ments of U.S. grain to the U.S.S.R. announced by the President on
January 4 and the subsequent refusal of longshoremen on the East and
Gulf coaststo load non-embargoed grain bound for the Soviet Union. U.S.
agricultural exports have been higher than expected because more grain
than was anticipated has been reaching the U.S.SR. Other countries,
mainly Argentina, have boosted shipments to the U.S.S.R. and U.S.
exporters have picked up sales to traditional Argentine markets. In
spite of the strong export performance, grain prices have declined 5-10
per cent since the announcement of the embargo. At the end of March,
the government had acquired only about 1.3 MMmt of the 13 MMmt under
contract to the U.S.S.R. that the administration agreed to buy.
Foreign official assets in the United States fell by somewhat
less than $1 billion in February.
.OPEC assets held at the FRBNY increased
by about $1 billion in March.

IV-14
In February, net inflows of funds through banks were again
modest when measured on a daily average basis, although a substantial
inflow apparently related to month-end transactions appears in the
balance-of-payments data. Partial data for March indicate that sub-
stantial net inflows through banks did develop last month. Net foreign
purchases of U.S. corporate stock in January and February totalled $1.7
billion -- exceeding the total for all of 1978 or 1979.
U.S. nonbank holdings of Eurodollars are estimated to have risen
by $1.2 billion to $48.3 billion in February, after rising by $7.2
billion in January. Partial data for March indicate that Eurodollar
CD holdings of open-ended money-market mutual funds and short-term
unit investment trusts declined sharply; at the end of the month they
amounted to $8.1 billion, which was just slightly more than at the
beginning of the year. In February these holdings had reached a level
of $10 billion.

IV-15
Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity remains strong
in Japan, Germany, and Italy. Industrial production rose sharply in
Japan and Italy in February. In Germany industrial production remained
at a high level through February. Real GDP growth slowed but remained
positive during 1979-QIV in Canada, France and the United Kingdom. Pre-
liminary data indicate that real activity has slowed further in France
during 1980-QI and in the United Kingdom may have declined.
Inflation rates remain high abroad, but in many cases were slightly
lower for the most recent months than the very high levels experienced
at the beginning of the year. This was the case for both retail and
wholesale prices in the United Kingdom and in Italy (where the high
January CPI rise was in part due to increases in regulated prices) and
for the CPI in Germany, Belgium, and Sweden.
Policy measures directed primarily against inflation were announced
during March by authorities in several foreign countries. The budget
for fiscal year 1980/81 was presented by the government in the United
Kingdom. It called for continued adherence to a monetary growth rate
target and a tightening of fiscal policy. The Bank of Japan again
raised its discount rate, announced higher reserve ratios, and set
reduced limits for bank lending growth. In Germany the Bundesbank
continued to pursue a tight monetary policy. In addition, the govern-
ment is trying to reduce expenditure levels generally so that increased
defense spending and increased foreign assistance (esp. for Turkey) will
not result in a larger budget deficit.
In response to the fact that 1979 monetary growth exceeded the
target, the Bank of France increased the quantity of bank credits

subject to credit controls. Similarly, the Bank of Italy announced new
regulations to enforce its bank credit ceilings. The Swedish government
has declared a temporary general price freeze while a new central wage
settlement is being negotiated. The Dutch government has adopted a new
wage control policy. The Belgian National Bank raised its discount rate
again, from 12 to 14 percent.
Individual Country Notes. The government budget for the United
Kingdom for fiscal year 1980/81 beginning April 1 was presented by
Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe on March 26. It provides
that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) will be reduced
from £9 billion (or 4.75 percent of GDP) in FY 1979/80 to £8.5 billion
this fiscal year as the result of a net 1 percent cut in real government
spending and increased revenue from higher excise taxes and the petro-
leum revenue tax which more than offset lost revenues due to higher
income tax exemptions. It also included the announcement that the M3
target growth rate will remain at 7 to 11 percent, but the base will
be shifted from mid-June 1979 to mid-February 1980 and that the "corset"
reserve requirement on the growth of interest-bearing liabilities above
prescribed limits will end on June 18. The budget also includes for
the first time medium-term targets for the main monetary and fiscal
aggregates. These provisions provide that by FY 1983/84 the rate of
growth of £M3 will decrease to 6 percent, real public spending will
fall by 4 percent, and the PSBR will decrease to between 1 and 2 percent
of GDP.
In 1979-QIV, real GDP in the United Kingdom increased by only
0.3 percent. While the volume of retail sales rose in January and

IV-20
February, the decline in industrial production in January and the strike
against the British Steel Corporation suggest that real GDP declined in
the first quarter of this year. The 13-week strike was ended on April
1 after workers accepted a settlement worth nearly 18 percent in wage
increases and other benefits. Both retail and wholesale prices rose
1.4 percent (n.s.a.) in February. A 5-1/2 percent increase in the
volume of exports was the main factor contributing to a reduction in
February in both trade and current-account deficits.
Despite previous contractionary measures, activity in Japan has
remained very strong. A large increase in the preliminary figure for
industrial production in February brought that index to a level more
than 12 percent above its level in February 1979. Moreover, there are
indications that this figure will be revised upwards. Demand also
appears to have remained relatively buoyant, at least through February,
with exports and private investment providing the major strength.
Wholesale prices rose 2.6 percent in February (an annual rate of more
than 30 percent), the largest monthly increase since early 1974.
Increases in consumer prices continue to be more moderate, but still
significant; in the first quarter the Tokyo CPI rose almost 2 percent
above its 1979-QIV level. Larger increases are expected in coming
months, as recently announced increases in utility tariffs and the
latest wholesale price rises are passed on to consumers.
The Japanese authorities continued to tighten monetary policy
in March in an effort to bring both inflationary pressure and downward
pressure on the yen under control. For the second time this year, on
March 19 the discount rate was raised by 1.75 percentage points to 9

IV-21
percent, its highest level since shortly after the 1973 oil crisis.
Reserve ratios were raised again, effective April 1, and lending limits
for the large city banks in the second quarter were increased by approx-
imately 85 percent of the corresponding increase a year ago. The new
limits will constrain bank lending to an estimated 6 percent increase
by the end of June over year-earlier levels. In mid-March, coupled
with a pronouncement that "the price situation had entered an extremely
serious phase," the government also announced a package of anti-infla-
tion measures. These included deferral of some government expenditure,
cuts in telephone rates, closer surveillance of prices, release of
commodity stockpiles, and further promotion of energy conservation mea-
sures. Capital-account measures taken in March to help support the
yen appeared to have had, at best, a very limited and temporary effect,
as the yen depreciated well beyond the 250¥/$ point in the early days
of this month. An important factor in the downward pressure on the
yen was the continuation of very large deficits in Japan's current
account. The February deficit (s.a.) was slightly less than $1.5
billion, a decline of about $200 million from the January level.
While there are some indications that economic activity is level-
ling off in Germany, there are as yet no signs of the sharp slowdown
expected for later this year. Total industrial production through
February increased slightly above the relatively high level of late
last year while the rate of unemployment has remained at 3.5 percent
since late last year. Business climate indicators remain unchanged;
demand for investment goods continues strong. However, automobile
sales have dropped somewhat during February and March; and the volume

IV-22
of orders, especially from abroad, has declined somewhat recently. The
rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was 0.6
percent in March after a sharp price rise of 1.1 percent in February.
This puts consumer prices in the first quarter of this year 5.5 percent
above their year ago level. The wholesale and producers price indices
have risen even more rapidly and in February were 10.9 and 7.9 percent
respectively above their year-ago levels.
Economic activity in Italy in the early part of 1980 continued
the rapid expansion shown at the end of last year; in January and
February industrial production averaged 3 percent over the previous
two-month level. The consumer price inflation rate slowed to 1.7
percent in February and 0.9 percent in March, after its 3.3 percent
pace in January. The January increase reflected in part energy price
increases, quarterly rent adjustments, and public utility charge
increases. The deterioration in the trade account that began at the
end of last year persisted into this year. For November-February the
average monthly customs trade deficit (s.a. imports c.i.f.) was $1.5
billion, compared to $120 million for the previous three months.
On March 14 the Bank of Italy announced new regulations to enforce
its bank credit ceilings. Banks will be required to make non-interest-
bearing deposits at the central bank, varying from 10 to 50 percent of
the amount by which loans are in excess of the ceilings. The measure
was taken in response to strong loan demand, reflecting strong economic
activity, which induced some banks to exceed their lending limits.
French real GDP growth in 1979-QIV slowed to 0.7 percent (s.a.)
from 1.9 percent in the previous quarter. January industrial production

IV-23
figures and survey data indicate that growth will slow further the first
quarter of this year, but probably will not stagnate. Consumer prices
and wholesale prices have surged in the first two months of the year,
increasing by 3 percent and 2.8 percent respectively. For January and
February, the French trade deficit was more than $2 billion, a figure
which represents roughly the magnitude of the deficit for all of 1979.
Although the franc has weakened considerably with respect to the dollar
in the past month, it has risen to the top of the EMS.
French money growth was over 14 percent in 1979, more than 3 per-
cent above the 11 percent target. The excessive growth was primarily
due to rapid growth in credit for activities not fully integrated into
the credit control system. In an effort to deal with this excessive
growth, the Bank of France increased from 40 to 50 percent the fraction
of formerly excluded credit which must be included in controlled credit.
In the middle of March the Bank suspended its policy of daily interven-
tion in one month treasury bills; since then it has been conducting
intervention in seven day repurchases at 13 percent.
Economic activity in Canada continues to show some strength.
After falling for three successive months, industrial production rose
slightly in January, There is some preliminary evidence that inventory
accumulation, although slowing, remained positive in 1980-QI. The Bank
Rate as of April 10 was 16.2 percent. This represents a 2.2 percentage
point increase since the Bank of Canada moved on March 13 to a system
whereby the bank rate floats at 1/4 percent above the yield on 91-day
treasury bills.

On March 27 the Swedish government announced a general price
freeze until May 9 in order to facilitate a new central wage settlement
which would directly cover 35 percent of the private sector labor force.
The government said it would consider an extension of the freeze through
the end of the year if such action were needed. Swedish consumer prices
accelerated during the second half of 1979 and then rose by almost 5
percent from December to February. In the Netherlands parliament
approved on March 22 the government's wage control bill which will
reduce by one-half the semi-annual cost of living adjustment in wages
and welfare payments. The new wage control policy results from the
failure of union-business-government negotiations during the wage freeze
that was in force from January 10 to March 10. The trade deficit for
January and February in Switzerland was $1.25 billion. This figure
exceeds that for the first two quarters of 1979 and suggests that the
Swiss current-account balance has become negative.
