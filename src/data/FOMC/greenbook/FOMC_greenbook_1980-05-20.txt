The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Incoming data confirm that a marked contraction of economic
activity is underway. Sizable further cutbacks were made during April
to production and employment in motor vehicle- and construction-related
industries, and declines have spread to other sectors as well. Total
retail sales in nominal terms fell substantially in April for the third
consecutive month. In March, residential and nonresidential construc-
tion activity were reduced, while spending on capital equipment was
relatively well-maintained. Producer and consumer prices continued to
increase rapidly in March, but in April a large decline in food prices
resulted in an easing of inflation at the producer level.
Employment and Production
Labor demand fell sharply in April, as nonfarm payroll employ-
ment dropped 480,000. Contractions in employment were widespread, with
almost three-quarters of the nonfarm industries covered by the establish-
ment survey posting declines in payrolls. However, the reduction in
employment was concentrated at durable goods manufacturers, trade establish-
ments, and at construction sites, where payrolls have fallen 335,000
since January. About half the job loss in durable goods manufacturing
was in automobiles and trucks, and much of the remainder was among
suppliers to the construction and motor vehicle industries. A large
reduction in overtime hours in April contributed to a decrease in the
overall factory workweek of 0.2 hour to 39.6 hours. Since January, the
average workweek has dropped three-quarters of an hour.
Total employment, as measured by the household survey, also
fell 1/2 million in April. The labor force increased by 325,000, and

the jobless rate rose 0.8 percentage point to 7.0 percent, the highest
since August 1977. Much of the increase in unemployment occurred among
adult men, but nearly all demographic groups sustained some increase
in joblessness. Job losers contributed heavily to the sharp rise in
the number of unemployed, and the unemployment rate for blue-collar
workers jumped to 9.7 percent.
According to tentative staff estimates, industrial production
fell about 2 percent in April, the largest one-month drop since early
1975. Auto assemblies fell 15 percent to a 6.0 million unit rate in
April and are expected to remain near that level in May; output of trucks
and automotive parts and supplies fell sharply, as did steel production.
Output of construction supplies also registered a sizable drop in April
and has now declined about 7 percent since January. But, in contrast
to recent months when declines in output were concentrated in those two
areas, cutbacks during April occurred in most other industries as well,
including home goods, textiles, and business supplies.
Reflecting the large and widespread curtailments in industrial
production, capacity utilizaiion rates for manufacturers are estimated
to have dropped in April to the lowest levels in more than three years.
Operating rates for manufacturing and also for producers of industrial
materials have been declining for more than a year and April were
estimated to have been around 6 percentage points below their recent
cyclical highs.
Consumer spending
Consumers continued to cut their spending in April, and nominal
retail sales fell 1-1/4 percent, following a downward-revised 2-1/4

percent drop in March. Since January, such sales have fallen 5 percent--
the largest 3-month decline on record. Excluding autos and mainly non-
consumption items, nominal retail spending rose 3/4 percent in April to
its January level, in part reflecting further large increases in gasoline
purchases. Sales at apparel stores rose modestly, while those at general
merchandise and at furniture and appliance stores were about unchanged.
For the FAG grouping as a whole, nominal spending in April was about 2
percent below the first-quarter average.
Total unit auto sales in April were at an 8.2 million unit annual
rate--off almost 2.5 million units from the first quarter rate and the
slowest monthly sales pace since the spring of 1975. Sales of domes-
tically-produced units in April were at a 6.0 million unit annual rate,
down 2 million from the first-quarter pace. Some of the decline can be
attributed to the termination of rebate programs and dealer incentive
contests, but the magnitude of this drop reportedly was exacerbated by
restrictive credit conditions and by heightened consumer fears of a
recession. Sales of imported cars in April--at a 2.2 million unit rate--
were 500,000 below the first-quarter rate; even so, the market share
of imports reached 27.2 percent in April--about equal to the high
recorded in February.
The retrenchment in consumer spending over the past three
months appardntly reflects to a considerable extent the tightening
of financial conditions as well as the weakness of real household incomes.
In real terms, disposable personal income declined about 1/2 percent
over the first quarter, following a year of essentially no change.
Moreover, data on hours and earnings in April suggest that wages and

salaries probably decreased substantially further in nominal terms last
month.
Surveys of consumer attitudes conducted in April indicated a
further deterioration of consumers' views about general business conditions
and their own personal financial situations. The Conference Board index
of confidence declined for the sixth consecutive month, and the Univer-
sity of Michigan Survey Research Center reported that consumer confidence
had fallen to a record low level. According to the Michigan Survey, con-
sumers were particularly negative about market conditions for large house-
hold durable goods, which most respondents attributed to high interest
rates and lack of credit availability.
Business Fixed Investment
Business investment was characterized in March by continued rela-
tively strong growth in spending on capital equipment and a further
decline in construction activity. Shipments of nondefense capital goods
rose 2 percent in March, following a similar increase in February; in
constant dollars these shipments appear to have been about 4 percent
higher in the first quarter than in the preceding quarter. Spending on
nonresidential construction fell 2-1/2 percent in nominal terms in
March after a comparable decline in February; even so, outlays--both
nominal and constant dollar--in the first quarter were substantially
above the fourth quarter.
Business fixed capital spending plans and commitments generally
have indicated that shipments of equipment should hold up well over the
next few months in spite of weakening consumer demands and high interest
rates. New orders for nondefense capital goods rose 6-1/4 percent in

March; for the first quarter as a whole, bookings totaled about 6 percent
more than in the final quarter of 1979, with gains fairly evenly split
between the machinery and nonmachinery components. However, contracts
for private industrial and commercial building and for nonbuilding
construction have continued to fluctuate around the level reached nearly
two years ago, and permits for nonresidential building, which had not
changed, on balance, since early 1979, fell substantially in March.
It should be noted that these indicators of spending intentions probably
do not fully reflect the changes in financial conditions since the
middle of March or the severity of the declines in production in April.
Finally, the spring McGraw-Hill survey of plant and equipment
spending, taken in late March and early April, reported that business is
planning to increase spending by 12-1/2 percent in 1980, compared with
the 9-1/2 percent rise anticipated in the fall survey. But, the spring
survey has consistently overestimated actual spending frowth--frequently
by a large margin; in view of this record, the McGraw-Hill reading
does not appear to be out of line with earlier surveys that suggested
little or no growth in constant-dollar plant and equipment outlays in
1980.
Inventory Investment
The book value of total manufacturing and trade inventories
increased at a $31 billion annual rate, a considerably slower pace than
earlier in the first quarter. Accumulation was concentrated at manufac-
turers, where large increases were reported by the aerospace and the
petroleum and coal products industries. Total retail inventories edged
up only slightly in March, as a sizable increase in stocks at general

merchandisers was largely offset by declines in the value of stocks held
by automotive outlets. Wholesale trade inventories fell at a substan-
tial rate in March; declines in this sector were widespread, with a
particularly large drop in merchants' stocks of raw farm products.
In April, unit stocks of domestic automobiles at dealers were
unchanged after declining for five consecutive months. Nonetheless,
the precipitous fall in sales during April resulted in a sharp rise in
the ratio of stocks to sales; significant increases in days' supply were
reported for all size classes of domestically-produced cars.
Residential Construction
Housing market activity worsened appreciably further in March,
as sales of single-family homes declined for the sixth consecutive
month. Sales of existing homes fell 8 percent, and sales of new homes
dropped 17 percent, reaching the lowest level in five years. For the
first quarter as a whole, total home sales were 16 percent below the
pace of the previous quarter. Builders have been adjusting production
rapidly in response to flagging sales and high construction loan rates,
as evidenced by the drop in single-family starts in March to a 600,000
unit annual rate--the third lowest monthly rate in 20 years. Nonethe-
less, the backlog of unsold new homes in March rose to a 10.6 months'
supply--just below the peak reached in the 1974-75 housing downturn.
In the multifamily sector, building also has been held down by adverse
financial conditions, but historically low rental vacancy rates and
sustained demand for condominium units appear to have cushioned the
decline in this sector somewhat.

Consistent with the slack in housing markets that developed
late last year, increases in house prices have slowed markedly, on
balance, in recent months. The volatile average sales price of a new
home fell sharply in March to about the December average and was only
6 percent higher than a year earlier--about half the gain of the pre-
ceding 12 months. The average price of an existing home sold advanced
slightly in March to a level 12-1/2 percent above a year ago.
Facing the prospect of further erosion in single-family housing
markets, the administration in April authorized the Federal Housing
Administration to issue loan insurance for the financing of completed,
unsold units--a measure that should lower the cost to builders of carrying
inventories. The administration also has proposed that subsidies for a
limited number of mortgages on single-family homes be offered to moderate-
income buyers; this recommendation is now under consideration in Congress.
Federal Government Sector
Treasury Department preliminary data indicate that in April the
unified budget surplus (not seasonally adjusted) was higher than expec-
ted by the staff and the administration. Receipts were higher because
of a large-increase in nonwithheld income taxes, which was due in part
to a speed-up in the pace at which the IRS processed income tax returns
with final settlements on 1979 liabilities. At the same time, however,
withheld income tax receipts appear to have been somewhat weaker.
Details for the expenditure side of the budget are still incomplete, but
preliminary data suggest that outlay growth in April continued at the
first quarter's rapid pace.

II-18
In response to the surge in layoffs in the automobile industry,
the administration has requested an additional $1.5 billion for trade
adjustment assistance (TAA) unemployment benefits ($1.1 billion in
fiscal year 1980 and $0.4 billion in fiscal year 1981). Upward pressure
on spending for TAA and other programs suggests that the budget totals
in fiscal year 1980 will be close to the estimates of $572 billion in
outlays and a deficit of $43 billion contained in the revised budget
resolution passed recently by the House of Representatives. For fiscal
year 1981, the House resolution sets outlays at $612 billion and the
surplus at $2 billion (without inclusion of the oil import fee). The
Senate's resolution with outlays and revenues at about $613 billion,
calls for a balanced budget in fiscal year 1981, but obtains that balance
by including a very small portion of the oil import fee with general
revenue. While the overall fiscal positions of the House and Senate
resolutions are about the same, the Senate has recommended more spending
for defense and less for domestic programs than the House. The differ-
ences between the two resolutions will be settled in conference.
State and Local Government Sector
State and local government activity continues to be marked by
small employment gains and declining investment outlays. So far this
year, state and local government payrolls have increased at only about
three-fourths of last year's average monthly pace. In March, however,
participation in the CETA public service employment program for the
structurally unemployed (Title II) rose slightly, the first-increase in
CETA enrollments since August 1979.

I-19
Investment outlays by state and local governments, as measured
by the value of new construction put-in-place, declined 9 percent in
March, following a smaller decline in February. A sharp drop in highway
construction accounted for more than half of the decrease in March, but
spending fell in the the other project categories as well.
Prices
Inflation has continued at a very rapid pace so far this year.
Consumer prices rose steadily at a 1.4 percent monthly rate during the
first quarter of the year. At the producer level, prices of finished
goods increased at a 1-1/2 percent monthly pace over the first quarter,
but a sharp drop in food prices held the rise in producer prices in
April to 1/2 percent.
Food prices generally have exerted a moderating influence on
the rise in overall price measures in recent months, despite a sharp
rise in March at the retail level. At the producer level, finished food
prices fell 2-3/4 percent in April, following declines averaging about
1-1/4 percent per month over the first quarter. Decreases in April were
particularly large for livestock and poultry products, which have been
in relatively good supply in recent weeks. These steep drops in whole-
sale prices should alleviate cost pressures on grocers and permit them
some easing of retail price increases over the next few months.
Retail energy price increases in March, although still large,
eased noticeably from the extremely high rates posted in January and
February, when the bulk of the price hikes for imported crude oil in
December was absorbed. At the producer level, energy prices rose in
April at only about half the rate registered in the preceding two months.

However, if the proposed oil import fee is allowed to become effective,
gasoline prices may accelerate again over the next few months, although
the extent of the pass-through may be limited somewhat by the record
levels of gasoline inventories.
Consumer prices for items other than food and energy rose 1.2
percent in March, about the average monthly increase since late last year.
Prices for commodities accelerated slightly, as a sharp rise in apparel
prices more than offset a moderate advance in new car prices and a small
rise in home prices. New car prices in the April CPI likely will
reflect the substantial increases recently announced by the major auto-
makers. Indeed, at the producer level, these hikes in new car prices
raised noticeably the prices of consumer finished goods. In addition,
price increases jumped sharply last month for most types of capital
equipment.
The cost of consumer services accelerated further in March as
a sharp increase in mortgage interest rates once again boosted home-
ownership costs. Moreover, the significant increases in interest rate
commitments that occurred earlier this year are likely to push up con-
sumer prices further in coming months. In contrast, a marked slowdown
occurred in the rate of increase in charges for medical care.
Declines in the prices of lumber, precious metals, lead, and
copper in recent weeks helped to reduce the overall rise in intermediate
materials prices during April. However, prices of industrial chemicals
and petroleum-based products continued to move up at a rapid rate, largely
reflecting the indirect effects of higher crude oil prices. Prices of
crude materials other than food and energy fell sharply for the second

consecutive month in April, in part because of a substantial drop in
scrap metal prices.
Productivity and Labor Costs
Labor cost pressures continued to be intense in early 1980, as
compensation increases were substantial and productivity remained slug-
gish. Output per hour in the private nonfarm business sector edged
lower at a one-fourth percent annual rate in the first quarter, following
a 2 percent drop over the preceding year. A particularly sharp fall-off
in productivity was recorded for the durable manufacturing sector, while
output per hour rose slightly at nondurable manufacturing establishments.
Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector increased
at a 9.7 percent annual rate during the first quarter. This increase
in compensation, combined with the small decline in productivity, caused
unit labor costs to rise at a 10 percent annual rate in the first quarter.
In April, wages for nonfarm production workers, as measured by the volatile
index of average hourly earnings, rose at only a 2-1/2 percent annual
rate to a level 8-1/4 percent above a year ago. Manufacturing wages
increased at a 9-1/2 percent annual rate, slightly below the average
gain for this sector so far this year.
Wage increases negotiated in major collective bargaining settle-
ments (1,000 or more workers) accelerated slightly in the first quarter
of 1980. For all major contracts, first-year wage increases, excluding
potential increases under cost-of-living (COLA) clauses, averaged 7.8
percent in the first 3 months of 1980, compared with a 7.4 percent increase
in 1979. In contracts that include COLA provisions, average first-year
increases were about the same as the 6 percent rise in 1979. However, in

agreements without the COLA clauses, the average first-year increase hit
11 percent at an annual rate--substantially higher than the average 9 per-
cent increase last year; this acceleration most likely represents large
"catch-up" increases for real income losses last year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The decline in market interest rates that had begun in early April
accelerated after the last FOMC meeting. This further sharp drop in
rates has occurred amid accumulating evidence of a contraction in economic
activity and an associated slackening in demands for money and credit.
Short-term market rates have fallen below levels that prevailed just prior
to the System's October 6 actions; although long-term bond yields have not
fallen that far, they have retraced their first quarter run-up. Adminis-
tered rates at banks and thrift institutions have moved down much more
slowly, in part reflecting concerns of these institutions about their
earnings margins; banks also have sought to constrain loan growth in line
with the Board's guidelines.
The relatively high cost of bank credit likely contributed to the
sharp falloff in business loans at commercial banks in April. Commercial
paper was a less expensive source of funds for businesses, but the pace
of issuance moderated from the extraordinary rate of earlier in the year.
A number of firms turned to public bond markets as long-term rates fell,
the proceeds from many of these debt issues apparently being used to
repay short-term borrowings.
Growth of consumer installment credit slowed in March and likely
weakened further in April. The credit restraint program reinforced the
movement towards reduced credit availability at many lenders; and at the
same time, consumers apparently have become more hesitant to use credit.
Mortgage market activity also was extremely weak, as high interest
rates posted by thrift institutions experiencing sluggish deposit flows

and earnings pressures discouraged borrowers. Primary mortgage rates
remained near peak levels through most of April, but moved down in May.
State and local governments greatly expanded their use of security
markets in April. The gross volume of tax-exempt bond issues jumped, as
declining rates on municipal bonds allowed many governmental units to
issue debt that previously had been restrained by statutory rate ceilings
or by a reluctance to borrow at record rates. Treasury financing in April
was relatively light.
The monetary aggregates were exceptionally weak in April. Transac-
tions balances fell sharply, and the aggregate of savings and small time
deposits grew only moderately. The assets of money market mutual funds
changed little through April, as most MMMFs stopped taking new accounts
in response to the special deposit requirement announced in mid-March,
but fund shares increased considerably in early May.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The narrowly defined money stock measures contracted sharply during
April. M-1A declined at an 18-1/2 percent annual rate, reflecting both
deceleration in growth of the currency component and, for the second con-
secutive month, a steep fall in demand deposits. Despite acceleration
in the growth of ATS and NOW accounts, M-1B declined at a 14-3/4 percent
annual rate. Needs for transactions balances fell in response to weaken-
ing economic activity, and the run-up of interest rates in the first quar-
ter may well have contributed to the recent contraction in demand deposits.
In addition, some of the record drop in April may have been attributable
to the faster pace at which the Treasury reportedly processed taxpayers'
checks relative to past years.

Despite continuing strength in variable-ceiling small time deposits,
the nontransactions component of M-2 grew at only a 1-1/2 percent annual
rate in April. Savings deposits at banks and thrift institutions con-
tinued to drop at rapid rates, and further declines also occurred in
fixed-ceiling small time deposits. Some shifting of deposits into 2-1/2
year variable-ceiling accounts reportedly took place in late April when
MMC yields fell and it became clear that the 2-1/2 year rate would soon
drop below the 12 percent cap. Overall, savings and small time deposits
grew at an 11-3/4 percent annual rate at commercial banks, and at a much
lower 1-1/2 percent rate at thrifts.
Among other components of M-2, overnight RPs and Eurodollar deposits
fell sharply in April. Meanwhile, the growth of money market mutual funds
came to a virtual halt on a monthly average basis. Many of the existing
funds stopped accepting new accounts after the imposition of the 15 per-
cent special reserve requirement in March, and aggregate assets of MMMFs
declined for four weeks following the action. Such assets increased some-
what during the last two weeks of April, and growth accelerated sharply in
early May; "clone" funds accounted for perhaps 20 percent of the increase.
In early May, clone funds were returning an average yield near 12 percent;
although this rate was substantially below the 15-1/2 percent return
yielded by non-clone MMMFs, it was 75 basis points above the effective
yield on MMCs offered by depositary institutions.1 Perhaps reflecting in
part the reduced availability of MMMFs, noncompetitive tenders during the

that resulted from the recent drop in short-term market interest rates.
If such gains are excluded, yields would be close to 11 percent for regu-
lar MMMFs, and 9-3/4 percent for clone funds.

April Treasury bill auctions were extremely large, especially early in
the month when yields were near peaks.
Total bank reserves grew at a 2-3/4 percent annual rate in April,
somewhat above the average pace from December to March. Following an ear-
lier succession of monthly increases, borrowed reserves declined by $370
million in April.1 The decline in borrowing followed the imposition of
the surcharge for large banks that borrowed frequently, and was associated
with a drop of more than 4 percentage points in the federal funds rate
during April. In early May, adjustment borrowing fell even further as the
federal funds rate dropped below the discount rate for the first time in
three years. Nonborrowed reserves in April increased 13-3/4 percent, at
an annual rate, reversing declines registered in the two previous months.
Reserves held under the marginal reserves program fellfrom over $2 bil-
lion in early April to $1 billion in early May as banks reduced the volume
of their managed liabilities above the base levels.
Following a marked slowing in March, bank credit contracted in
April at an annual rate of 5 percent, as both loan and investment port-
folios shrank. Banks liquidated a large volume of Treasury securities,
and acquisitions of other securities slowed. Growth in all bank loan
categories weakened in April; business and security loans actually fell.
Loan activity generally was weakest at small banks, which appeared to
move to a more restrictive posture because of the high cost of funds rela-
tive to their returns.
1. By the end of April, no loans had yet been disbursed under the new sea-
sonal borrowing privilege instituted for small banks, although a number
of commitments to lend had been made by Reserve Banks.

As loans and investments declined in April, banks reduced their
managed liabilities by an estimated $6 billion. The net reduction
reflected a large decline in net Eurodollar borrowings and other nonde-
posit funds that more than offset a $5 billion increase in gross large
time deposits. A reduction in weekend reserve avoidance activity accounted
for about one-quarter of the total reduction in net liabilities due to
related foreign institutions.
Business Finance
Total business external financing appears to have moderated in April;
in part businesses may have drawn on liquid assets accumulated earlier
this year when bank borrowing evidently was accelerated in anticipation
of credit controls. Moreover, there was a marked shift in the pattern of
business credit demands from short-term to long-term markets. Business
loans at commercial banks, net of bankers acceptances, contracted at a
7-1/4 percent annual rate, and commercial paper issuance by nonfinancial
firms dropped to roughly half the pace of March--though it remained siz-
able. At the same time, the volume of publicly offered corporate bonds
rose substantially in April to the largest monthly total in nearly a
year.
The contraction of bank loans to businesses during April occurred
despite two previous months of pronounced expansion in outstanding commit-
ments at sampled large banks (see chart on page 111-8). Some of the
increased commitments may have been to guard against the possibility of
reduced credit availability under credit controls, rather than in antici-
pation of specific financing needs. In April, moreover, cost considera-
tions--as adjustments in the prime rate lagged substantially behind

downward movements in other market rates--greatly reduced the attractive-
ness of this source of funds. At the end of April the bank prime rate
exceeded the rate on 3-month commercial paper by more than 7 percentage
points. The recent behavior of the prime rate may reflect banks' attempts
to maintain earnings margins and to slow loan growth in the face of the
Special Credit Restraint Program and rising costs imposed by the increase
in marginal reserve requirements.
Although the high prime rate increased the relative attractiveness
of commercial paper financing, the volume of paper issuance by nonfinan-
cial firms, particularly industrial firms, moderated on average in April
from the first-quarter pace. Paper issuance by financial companies picked
up in April, buoyed by issues of insurance companies needing funds to meet
increased demands for policy loans and previously made commitments to
acquire mortgages and corporate debt obligations.
Gross public offerings of longer-term corporate debt issues rose to
$2.8 billion, seasonally adjusted, in April, a substantial increase over
the $1.7 billion total in March. Nearly half of the April debt volume
comprised obligations of industrial concerns, in contrast to earlier
months when utilities were the major issuers. The pace of bond issuance
is accelerating further in May.
Corporate bond yields have declined 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 basis points since
the April FOMC meeting and almost 3 percentage points since their all-time
peak in late March. Accompanying the downward movement in rates, measures
of risk premia between lower- and higher-rated corporate bonds have nar-
rowed recently from the near-record spreads of early April. These measures
narrowed somewhat in the early stages of the two previous recessions, but

widened sharply in the later phases as investors became increasingly con-
cerned about credit quality.
Major stock price indexes have climbed 3 to 6 percent since the
April FOMC meeting. Market participants cite the unprecedented decline
in interest rates as an important factor accounting for the improvement
in stock prices. Interest rate movements may have had a particularly
favorable impact on the share prices of financial corporations in recent
weeks. The stock prices of these companies declined more than the broad
indexes when short-term interest rates rose sharply earlier this year,
but a portion of these declines has been retraced since late March (see
chart on page III-12). New common and preferred stock financings totaled
more than $1.3 billion, seasonally adjusted, in April; industrial corpora-
tions--especially petroleum and natural gas concerns--continued to supple-
ment the relatively large amount of equity offerings by public utilities.
Government Debt Issues
Net Treasury borrowing through marketable debt issues totaled $1.3
billion (not seasonally adjusted) in April. This total reflects $2.8 bil-
lion raised in note and bond auctions partially offset by net reductions
of $1.5 billion in Treasury bills outstanding. In the mid-quarter refund-
ing an additional $3.6 billion is being raised--an unusually large amount
for the second quarter. The Treasury expects a sizable budget surplus
over the quarter, but it has continued to sell marketable debt to offset
large redemptions of nonmarketable debt and to build up its cash balances
before the end of the period. Total nonmarketable debt issues held by
foreigners and by state and local governments fell $0.9 billion in April,
while public holdings of U.S. savings bonds dropped $1.8 billion.

Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies is estimated
to have totaled $5.6 billion in April, after seasonal adjustment, higher
even than the previous record level in March. Of this total, FHLBs raised
$1.3 billion, FNMA raised $3.3 billion, and the Federal Farm Credit Bank
raised $1 billion. The funds raised by the two housing agencies primarily
were intended to finance mortgage acquisitions and advances to member
institutions; but the low level of such activities in April enabled the
agencies to increase their liquidity and will likely lower their borrowing
needs in May.
The sharp decline in interest rates encouraged state and local gov-
ernments to increase greatly their borrowing in April. Gross offerings
of tax-exempt bonds surged to almost $5.5 billion, seasonally adjusted--
double the monthly average pace of the first quarter. Some of the April
volume represented issues that had been postponed earlier this year
because of unstable market conditions and interest rate ceilings that were
below prevailing market rates. Offerings of housing revenue bonds, nearly
all of which were earmarked to finance single-family mortgages, increased
further and accounted for slightly more than $1.4 billion (NSA) of total
long-term issues in April.
Mortgage Markets
Costs of both short-term construction credit and long-term mortgage
loans have fallen since the April FOMC meeting, though average primary
mortgage rates have remained quite high relative to other long-term inter-
est rates. Yields in the secondary markets for home mortgages have
declined by 1 to 2 percentage points, extending the slide from the peaks

in late March. Average interest rates on new commitments for conventional
home loans at S&Ls have declined by 167 basis points from the record level
prevailing during the first three weeks of April, and average rates in
the West, which reached 17 percent in April, have fallen by 3 percentage
points.
The downturn in mortgage rates apparently reflected the reduced cost
of funds to lending institutions and expectations for improved deposit
flows which contributed to a desire to increase mortgage market activity
from depressed levels in March. At savings and loan associations, new
mortgage commitments made in March fell to $4.6 billion, about half the
monthly average volume recorded in the third quarter of last year prior
to the firming actions in October. Mortgage commitments outstanding at
the end of March amounted to $24.1 billion, more than one-fourth below
the peak last fall; in real terms (deflated by construction costs), out-
standing commitments were at their lowest level since early 1975.
A special survey of 126 large S&Ls conducted by the FHLBB indicated
that roughly 12 percent of the respondents liberalized loan commitment
policies during the first half of April, while 20 percent reported firmer
policies. But during the second half of the month, about half reported
that they had liberalized their loan commitment policies, primarily
through reductions in interest rates.
The outstanding volume of FHLB advances to thrift institutions
changed little in April, following a record $3.6 billion increase in such
borrowings in March. Further slowing in mortgage acquisitions, coupled

with increased issuance of large time deposits by S&Ls during April (end
of month basis) apparently reduced their need for borrowed funds.1
In view of the substantial increases since late March in prices of
government-underwritten mortgages traded in the secondary markets, the
Administration lowered the ceiling rate for FHA/VA home loans by a full
percentage point to 13 percent, effective April 28. In addition, the
Administration in mid-April amended the FHA program, to help builders
reduce the carrying costs of their unsold inventories by replacing high-
rate construction loans; builders are now permitted to get FHA insurance
for permanent loans upon completion of a house which may then be rented,
rather than sold. The Secretary of HUD also announced Administration
support for legislative changes in the Section 235 home ownership program;
these changes would make interest subsidies available to middle-income as
well as lower-income households.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer credit outstanding slowed to a 5-1/2 percent
annual rate in March, holding the increase for the quarter to 6-3/4 per-
cent. At its most rapid pace in 1978, consumer credit grew at about a 20
percent rate, but the rate of expansion has trended downward since mid-
1979. Finance companies continued to account for the bulk of consumer
credit growth in March, as captives of the auto manufacturers, in particu-
lar, attempted to offset the impact on their parent companies' sales that
might result from the withdrawal of other lenders. Virtually no growth
1. The FHLB recently instituted a Targeted Advances Program to help meet
the needs of S&Ls that are facing particularly severe financial difficul-
ties as a result of market forces. Under the program, the Bank Board will
provide a 250 basis point subsidy on advances to qualifying associations.
No associations are reported to have yet applied for the subsidized advances.

occurred at commercial banks, and credit unions experienced their sixth
consecutive monthly contraction.
Consumer credit controls had been in force for only two weeks by
the end of March, and consequently the March figures shed little light
on the impact of the controls. Although aggregate statistics are not yet
available for April, widespread reports suggest a substantial curtailment
of consumer credit usage, particularly card credit, since the credit con-
trol package was announced March 14.
Much of the reported deceleration in consumer credit use may be
attributed to credit-tightening measures by lenders; in addition many con-
sumers apparently have reduced their use of credit accounts, perhaps in
part because of uncertainty concerning how controls would operate. In a
special Federal Reserve survey conducted during the second week of May,
more than half of the respondent banks indicated that they had adopted
more restrictive lending policies for auto loans and credit cards. At the
same time, most of the banks and finance companies in the survey reported
lessened demand for consumer credit since mid-March.
Most recently, as interest rates have dropped, announcements of
credit-tightening measures have diminished. Some retailers reported sub-
stantial declines in credit sales during April; to reassure their customers
that credit lines are still open, many retailers have placed ads in the
newspapers, and at least one major chain has sent out letters to its cus-
tomers.
As consumer credit growth has slowed in recent months, repayments
relative to disposable personal income have come down from the 1979-Q3
high (see chart on page 111-20). Delinquency rates on closed-end consumer

III-22
loans at banks fell off somewhat in the first quarter, with declines
greatest for loans to finance autos and mobile homes. In contrast, delin-
quency rates associated with bank card credit increased further, to near
the highs recorded in 1975.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets. The dollar has been under strong downward
pressure over most of the four week period since the last green book.
As shown in the top panel of the first chart, the dollar started to
drop sharply in the second week of April and since then the dollar's
weighted-average exchange value has fallen by 8 percent. This
decline has reversed about three-fourths of the dollar's previous
sharp rise during February and March.
Movements in the dollar's foreign exchange value in recent
months appear to have been triggered by the very sharp fluctuations
in U.S. interest rates over this period. As shown in the
second chart, during the period of the dollar's strength from
early February to early April U.S. interest rates rose sharply,
both absolutely and relative to average foreign interest rates. The
dollar's subsequent sharp decline coincided with an even larger
fall in U.S. interest rates. Both the magnitude and rapidity of
these U.S. interest rate changes appear to have been unanticipated
by the market, intensifying their impact on exchange rates. In
addition, some market participants apparently interpreted the rise
in U.S. interest rates as signaling a tightening of U.S. monetary
policy and the subsequent fall in rates as a sign of an easing of
U.S. monetary policy. In recent weeks, however, the growing evidence
of a U.S. recession and the continued decline in the monetary aggre-
gates contibuted to a shift in the interpretation of declining U.S.
interest rates toward a view somewhat more favorable to the dollar.
On a net basis, the dollar's average exchange value has risen by

about 1 percent over the past three months despite a net decline
in relative short-term interest rates on dollar-denominated assets
of about 5 percentage points during this period.
Because U.S. economic developments have dominated exchange
rate movements in recent months, fluctuations in the dollar's
exchange value relative to individual foreign currencies has been
fairly uniform. Over the four week period since the last green book
the dollar has depreciated by about 6 percent relative to the Swiss
franc, 5 percent against the mark and 4 percent against the pound.
The dollar has shown the greatest weakness relative to the Japanese
yen over the past month, depreciating by 10 percent. The decline
against the Canadian dollar has been only 2 percent with demand
for the Canadian currency depressed due to the approach of the
May 20 referendum on Quebec's status.
The Desk provided net intervention support for the dollar
totaling $500 million over the past four weeks. About three-fourths
of this total took the form of net sales of marks, with the remainder
split about equally between sales of Swiss and French francs. Net
mark sales were financed mainly from Treasury balances with the
remainder financed by System swap drawings. The Swiss franc sales

IV-5
were from System balances while swap drawings on the Bank of France
financed the French franc sales. Outstanding System swap drawings
increased to $400 million equivalent.

U. S. International Transactions
Despite a U.S. merchandise trade deficit in March that was sub-
stantially smaller than in the preceding two months, the first quarter
1980 deficit of $49 billion at an annual rate (international accounts
basis) was nevertheless more than $14 billion larger than the annual
rate deficit of the fourth quarter. Imports in the first quarter
increased by about twice as much as exports, but the rise in imports,
reflecting in large measure the effects of higher world oil prices on
oil imports, masked considerable strength in exports, particularly non-
agricultural shipments.
Nonagricultural exports increased nearly $15 billion at an annual
rate in the first quarter, an increase from the fourth quarter in excess
of 9 percent. While some of this increase may be attributed to transitory

silver exports reflecting the run-up in silver prices early in the year,
the underlying trend of this export performance has been quite strong
for the last three quarters. This strength is due in part to continuing
growth in foreign economic activity, particularly in Western Europe,
and also reflects the lagged response of exports to exchange rate
depreciations experienced over the last several years. Excluding silver,
the export growth in the first quarter, bouyed by the March increases,
was spread over a broad range of commodity categories including machinery,
civilian aircraft, other consumer goods, and other industrial supplies.
Agricultural exports amounted to $41 billion at an annual rate in
the first quarter, a slight decline from the fourth quarter rate. The
decline was entirely in volume (primarily grain and soybeans). Exports
of wheat, corn, and soybeans to the Soviet Union declined sharply to
95.5 million bushels in the first quarter from 208.7 million bushels in
the fourth quarter, principally because of the embargo announced on
January 4. The decline in volume attributable to the embargo appears to
have been less than that initiallyanticipated from the embargo order as
other countries' agricultural exports to the Soviet Union (principally
from Argentina) have increased, and U.S. exports have been diverted
towards the markets traditionally supplied by these countries.
Non-oil imports increased by 11 percent in the first quarter.
Imports of nonferrous metals accounted for nearly a third of this
increase as their prices, particularly those for gold and silver, rose
sharply at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. In
recent months gold and silver prices have decreased reversing this trend.
The remaining increase in non-oilimport value was broadly spread between

IV -8
volume and prices among capital goods, consumer goods, and foreign
automotive imports. Average foreign car import prices appear to have
risen about 3 percent in the first quarter leaving most of the quarter-
ly rise in value to an increasing volume of car imports. Sales of
foreign cars, which were very strong early in the year, eased in March
and April and the run-down in stocks appears to have been halted.
Forty percent of the increase in imports in the first quarter
was from the rising value of oil imports. Although the volume of oil
imports decreased from a fourth quarter level of 8.7 million barrels per
day (mbd) to a first quarter level of 8.5 mbd, the increase in quarterly
average oil import prices from $23.67/barrel to $28.05/barrel resulted
in a 15 percent increase in value.
Foreign official assets in the United States declined by $3 billion
in March, and partial data for April and May indicate a further decline
of $3-to-$4 billion. German, Swiss, and Japanese support for their
currencies during the recent strength of the dollar led toa$7 billion
decline in G-10 countries' holdings in March and further declines in
April due to delayed settlements and the unwinding in April of swaps
between the Bundesbank and commercial banks. In addition, about $2
billion equivalent of March U.S. intervention purchases of marks were
used to repay earlier drawings on the swap line with the Bundesbank;
the repayments reduced German holdings in the United States commensurate-
ly. (Another billion dollars equivalent of U.S. foreign-currency
purchases in March were added to U.S. reserve assets.) Partly offsetting
the decline in G-10 countries' holdings was a rise OPEC holdings of $2.7
billion. Partial data for April indicate a continued inflow of funds
from OPEC.

IV -9
Banks increased their reliance on affiliates in foreign countries
during March. Funds from such sources were apparently used by member
banks to support credit extensions in the United States, since weekend
reserve-avoidance activity, which also results in an increase in net
liabilities to foreign branches, declined sharply after mid-March. In
April, both member banks and U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks
reduced the amounts of their net liabilities to foreign affiliates.
(Recorded balance-of-payments data, as shown on the accompanying table,
indicate an outflow of funds through banks in March, after an inflow in
February. As noted last month, those apparent flows seem to be related
to large transactions -- probably on the books of U.S. agencies and
branches of foreign banks -- towards the end of February that were
reversed in early March.)
In the first quarter of 1980, as in the last quarter of 1979,
there were again quite sizeable capital inflows through other trans-
actions, including those not elsewhere recorded in balance-of-payments
accounts.
Euro-dollar CD holdings of open-ended, money-market mutual funds
and short-term unit investment trusts were little changed over the period
from late February to early May.

Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity abroad remains
quite strong. In Japan, industrial production for the first quarter
this year was 12 percent more than in last year's first quarter and 4.4
percent more than in the fourth quarter of 1979. In Germany and Italy
activity early this year has also been strong. Canadian industrial
production rose slightly in January and February, after declining during
the fourth quarter of last year. In France, Belgium and the Netherlands
the level of activity has remained unchanged from the last quarter of
1979.
Consumer price inflation abroad has accelerated over the last two
quarters, reaching an annual rate of 14.5 percent for a weighted average
of ten major foreign industrial countries (wholesale prices for Japan)
in the first quarter of this year, up from 10 percent in the fourth
quarter of last year. In Japan high month-to-month rates continued
through April. The most recent price data for Canada show an accelera-
tion, while in Germany and France the most recent data indicate a
slight easing of the rate of consumer price inflation.
Japan's current-account deficit has continued to widen during the
first quarter of this year to $5.1 billion , compared with a deficit
of $8.7 billion for the year 1979. The German current-account deficit,
similarly, has increased to $2.8 billion (n.s.a.) for the first quarter
this year, after a deficit of $5.0 billion for all of last year.
There has been some easing of foreign interest rates in April, as
pressures from a strong dollar and high U.S. interest rates abated.
German and Japanese interest rates were notable exceptions to this trend.
The German Bundesbank announced further increases of its discount and

Lombard rates on April 30. This was followed on May 2 by a discount
rate increase by the Netherlands National Bank.
In Germany, economic activity has remained buoyant so far this
year. Industrial production through March has increased from the high
level of late last year. The rate of unemployment has remained at 3.5
percent in April. There have been several statements recently by
German officials indicating a stronger-than-expected performance of
economic activity this year.
Inflation through April has continued at a high rate by German
standards. The April cost of living index was up 0.5 percent from March
and 5.7 percent from April of last year. During the first four months
of this year the cost of living rose at an annual rate of above 8 per-
cent. Wholesale and producers prices have accelerated even more rapidly.
For the first quarter of this year, the current-account deficit
(n.s.a.) was $2.8 billion, compared with a $1.4 billion surplus in the
corresponding quarter of 1979.
Effective May 2, the Bundesbank raised its discount rate from 7
to 7-1/2 percent and its Lombard rate from 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent. At
the same time, about DM 8 billion in liquidity was provided to the banks
by a reduction of 8 percent in reserve requirements and an expansion of
rediscount quotas. The last increase in Bundesbank rates prior to
these measures was on February 28.
Upward pressure on prices in Japan has remained strong in recent
months in spite of earlier measures to tighten monetary and fiscal con-
ditions. The wholesale price index registered another very large
increase in April and was 24 percent above its year-ago level. In April

IV-16
the Tokyo consumer price index moved upward sharply -- in part because
of higher utility charges put into effect in early April -- but was
still only about 7-1/2 percent above its level in April 1979. Activity
in Japan also seems to be relatively unaffected as yet by tighter
policies. Although industrial production has moved erratically in
recent months, the average level for the first quarter was almost 12 per-
cent above the corresponding level in the first quarter of 1979.
The Japanese current-account deficit widened in March, reaching a
monthly deficit of over $2.4 billion. As a result, the first-quarter
deficit was more than $5.1 billion. The March rise in the deficit was
about equally divided between decreased exports and increased imports.
Measures taken earlier to provide support for the yen appear to
have achieved some success in April and May, as the yen has strengthened
both against the dollar and on a weighted average basis despite adverse
current-account developments and recent difficulties with Iran over the
price to be paid for imported Iranian oil. The announcement on April 25
of a DM 2.5 billion swap-line agreement (about $1.4 billion equivalent)
with the German central bank, and the announcement of an estimated
¥50 billion per month ($215 million equivalent) borrowing arrangement
with the Saudi Arabian monetary authority, supported this strengthening
trend.
Canada, recorded moderate growth in economic activity during 1980-
QI. Industrial production rose at a low rate in both January and in
February. The trade surplus for the first quarter was more than $1.5
billion, compared with almost $3.0 billion for all of 1979. The rate

IV-17
of consumer price inflation accelerated in March. The monthly increase
was 1.1 percent compared with February's 0.9 percent.
On April 21, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister MacEachen
in a surprise move announced a "mini-budget" for 1980. This mini-
budget includes a 5 percent corporate income tax surcharge as well as
higher taxes on cigarettes and liquor -- these measures were previously
contained in the Clark Administration's ill-fated 1980 budget.. The.
Liberal government is expected to submit a more comprehensive budget for
1980 sometime this summer. The timing of this budget depends on nego-
tiations with the Province of Alberta on a federal/provincial split of
revenues from higher energy prices.
In the United Kingdom real consumer spending rose 2 percent in
the first quarter of this year. Part of this increase reflected the
stocking of alcoholic beverages ahead of the March 26 Budget, which
imposed higher taxes on these items. After increasing in January and
February, the volume of retail sales fell 1 percent in March, indicating
that consumption spending may be leveling off. Industrial production
fell in the first two months of this year, mainly as a result of a
strike against the nationalized sector of the steel industry. The un-
employment rate, which has been rising continuously since November last
year, increased from 5.8 percent in March to 6.0 percent in April (s.a.)
bringing the level of unemployment to 1.46 million, the highest in the
post-war period.
The rate of inflation in recent months remained high but below the
peak rate of January; the rate of increase in wholesale prices for manu-
factured goods declined from 1.6 percent in February to 1.3 percent in

IV-18
March (n.s.a.), and the retail price index rose 1.4 percent in March
(n.s.a.), the same as in February. Given the large increases in average
earnings, and the excise taxes announced in the March 26 Budget, which
will raise retail prices about 1 percent, price increases are unlikely
to moderate in the near future.
French real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 1979 slowed to
2.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) from more than 7.5 percent in the previous
quarter. Recent industrial production figures and survey data indicate
that growth may slow further in the first half of this year, but will
probably not stagnate. Entrepreneurs perceive stocks as rising, orders
as falling, and a smaller fraction expects production to increase now
than did in the last half of 1979. Consumer prices and wholesale prices
have surged recently, increasing by 3.8 percent and 3.1 percent respec-
tively in the first quarter over the previous quarter. However, recent
monthly figures show some deceleration. In the first quarter this year,
France had a trade deficit of $3.5 billion; the deficit for all of 1979
was $2.4 billion.
French money growth (M-2) was more than 14 percent in 1979, 3 per-
cent above the 11 percent target. The excessive growth was primarily
due to rapid growth in credit to activities not fully integrated into
the French credit control system. In an effort to deal with such ex-
cessive monetary growth, the Bank of France increased to 50 percent the
fraction of formerly excluded credits that must be included in restricted
credit. That fraction was only 30 percent in the last quarter of 1979
and 40 percent for the first quarter of this year.

The upswing in economic activity in Italy that characterized the
last part of 1979 has continued in the early part of 1980. In 1979Q-IV
real GDP increased by 3.9 percent compared with 1.1 percent in the
previous quarter. The strong fourth-quarter performance resulted in a
growth rate of real GDP of almost 5 percent in 1979. Industrial produc-
tion in the first two months of 1980 was 9-1/2 percent higher than year-
earlier levels. The rate of increase in consumer prices decelerated in
February and March following a sharp jump in January, but picked up
again in April. In the first quarter the CPI rose almost 6.5 percent
from its 1979Q-IV level. The trade deficit has widened substantially
in the past few months, with a 1980 first-quarter deficit of $4.1
billion, compared with a deficit of $0.1 billion in the first quarter of
1979 (customs basis, imports c.i.f.). This deterioration may reflect
not only oil-price increases and stockbuilding, but also a loss of
competitiveness resulting from a high rate of inflation in Italy rela-
tive to that of its trading partners.
In Belgium and the Netherlands preliminary data have yet to show
any reduction in the rate of real activity from 1979Q-IV to 1980Q-I.
The unemployment rate remains at the level reached at the end of 1979
in both countries. Consumer price inflation in Belgium rose from 5.8
percent (a.r.) in 1979Q-IV to almost 10 percent in the first quarter
of this year. In the Netherlands, the rate was approximately unchanged
over this interval at slightly more than 6 percent. In order to main-
tain the value of the guilder within the EMS and to maintain Dutch
interest rates in a balanced relationship with those of other EMS
countries, the Netherlands National Bank raised its discount rate from

9.5 percent to 10 percent as of May 2, 1980.
In Sweden, the most serious labor dispute in 70 years ended on
May 12 with the acceptance of a mediation proposal by the Swedish
employers confederation. On May 2, over 750,000 workers were locked out
by employers, and 100,000 others went on strike -- thus, about 25 per-
cent of Sweden's labor force was not at work. A 2.3 percent nominal
pay increase proposed by government-appointed mediators was rejected by
the private, blue-collar union, which was asking for an 11.3 percent in-
crease. The wage demands and offers were virtually identical in the
public sector. New pay offers of 6.8 and 7.2 percent for private and
public sector employees, respectively, were finally accepted.
The Danish government mustered a thin parliamentary majority for
a supplementary economic program. The most significant part of this
austerity program is an increase in the value-added tax effective
July 1, from 20.25 to 22 percent. The package also includes new
energy taxes, a $1.25 billion cut in government spending in 1981, and a
$1 billion program to promote industry.IV-20
