The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Incoming data indicate a continued contraction in overall economic
activity, but the downward momentum appears to have slowed. Outlays
for fixed capital have continued to weaken, while activity in housing
and auto sectors has firmed. The dramatic decline in final sales has
led to a sharp rise in inventory-sales ratios, but adjustment of excess
stocks appears to be proceeding at an unusually rapid pace. Prices
slowed considerably in the second quarter, due largely to an easing in
energy prices; the pace of increase remained rapid by historical
standards, and there are indications of an acceleration of food prices
in the near future.
Employment and Production
Nonfarm payroll employment adjusted for strikes, which is probably
the best indicator of near-term market conditions, fell by close to
100,000 in July, compared with an average monthly decline of more than
400,000 over the second quarter. Employment in the service-producing
sector resumed its upward trend, following two months of decline, as
sizable increases at retail trade and service establishments more than
offset the reduction in federal workers that had been hired temporarily
to take the 1980 Census. However, large employment cuts continued in
July in the manufacturing sector, where jobs fell by 250,000 and are
now nearly 1-1/2 million below their peak a year earlier. Payrolls were
pared at producers of both durable and nondurable goods. In durables,
sizable job losses occurred in primary and fabricated metals and
machinery, while in nondurables declines were evident in apparel, food,
and textiles. The factory workweek was unchanged in July at a

cyclically low level, following 5 consecutive monthly declines, and
overtime increased 0.1 hour.
In contrast to the decline indicated by the establishment data,
total employment as measured by the household survey actually rose
460,000 in July, after dropping 1-1/2 million over the preceding four
months. Job gains took place among both men and women, but almost half
of the increase occurred among 16 to 24 year old workers. Unemployment
also increased in July, and the jobless rate edged up to 7.8 percent.
Unemployment rates for most worker groups have not changed appreciably
since May, following sharp increases earlier this year.
The index of industrial production is expected to have declined
significantly further in July, although less than the 2.4 percent drop
recorded in June. While output in the lumber and steel industries
apparently leveled off in July after sharp downturns earlier in the year,
production of machinery and some nondurable goods probably recorded
further declines during the month. Auto output increased moderately
during July, but production of trucks changed little from the reduced
June level.
In June, capacity utilization in manufacturing was 76.1 percent,
down 2.3 percentage points from May. Utilization rates fell further
in July. The rate for all manufacturers, which so far are still
above the low of the previous recession,has declined more than 10
percentage points from its most recent high.

Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Income growth has slowed substantially recently, in line with the
weakness in production and employment. Personal income in nominal terms
rose at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate in June, about the same as the rate
since the beginning of the year, but considerably less than the 1979
pace. Nominal wages and salaries were virtually unchanged in June,
primarily because of further layoffs in manufacturing and reductions in
overtime schedules. In real terms, disposable income is estimated to
have fallen further, bringing the cumulative decline since the January
peak to about 2-1/2 percent. Moreover, in July nominal wages and
salaries probably were about unchanged from June, reflecting the drop
in aggregate weekly hours and the moderate rise in average hourly
earnings. Total personal income in July, however, was boosted by the
increase in social security benefits.
Despite the continued slow growth in personal income, consumer
spending turned up moderately in June after four consecutive monthly
declines. Total retail sales in nominal terms rose 1.5 percent. Nearly
all major categories of sales increased, with a good part of the over-
all advance attributable to the automotive sector. Excluding autos and
nonconsumption items, sales were up 1.1 percent, recovering the declines
of the two previous months. Sales at the GAF grouping of stores, which
sell mostly discretionary items, registered a sizable advance for the
second month. Total retail sales in June, however, were 5 percent
below their January peak, and in real terms they were still well below
their September 1979 peak.

Sales of domestic autos rose to a 6.4 million unit annual rate
in July, the best monthly rate since March. Sales of foreign-made
cars registered a relatively larger gain to a 2.6 million unit rate,
and took about 30 percent of the market.
The upturn in sales coincided with an improvement in consumer
attitudes. The indexes of consumer attitudes produced by both the
University of Michigan and the Conference Board rose for the second
consecutive month in July, although they remain at extremely low levels.
Both surveys indicated that the improved opinions expressed in June
about market conditions for the purchase of cars, large household
durables, and homes generally continued into July. Consumers' expecta-
tions of inflation over the next 12 months increased to 9.0 percent in
July from 8.1 percent in June, but they were down sharply from the
record 13 percent rate posted in January. In contrast to earlier in
the year, consumers now cite their expectations of lower interest
rates over the next year as a favorable factor in conditions for
household purchases.
Business Fixed Investment
Business capital spending remained weak in June. Shipments of
nondefense capital goods fell 1.2 percent in current dollars. For the
second quarter as a whole, nominal deliveries were 2.7 percent below
the first quarter pace--the sharpest quarterly drop reported since the
beginning of this series in 1968. Sales of heavy-weight trucks rose
50,000 units (annual rate) in June, yet sales in the second quarter
were still down 90,000 units from the first quarter pace. Finally,
nonresidential construction put-in-place declined slightly further in
June, and was down 2.2 percent in the second quarter.

1. FRB staff estimate.

II-9
A moderate recovery in shipments of capital goods could occur in
the near term if manufacturers work off sizable backlogs of unfilled
orders. However, the downtrend in new orders since the beginning of
the year suggests additional cutbacks in equipment into next year.
New orders for nondefense capital goods were off 10 percent in real
terms for the second quarter as a whole, although they rose slightly
in June. The machinery component posted an even steeper second quarter
drop. Moreover, declines in construction spending also seem probable,
as nonresidential contracts have trended down since the beginning of
the year.
Inventory Investment
Incoming data on inventory developments suggest a mixed picture
for June, as inventory investment at manufacturing continued to slow,
while it picked up at wholesalers. The book value of manufacturers'
inventories rose at only a $4 billion annual rate in June, following a
$10 billion rise in May. These rates are very low compared with
the $43 billion rate of accumulation during the first four months of the
year and suggest that manufacturers have acted rapidly to prevent an
excessive buildup of inventories. Indeed, the book value stocks of
durable goods actually declined, after rising rapidly for almost a year
and a half. The largest decreases were posted at producers of motor
vehicles and parts and fabricated metals. In spite of the reduced
accumulation in June, the stock-sales ratio for all manufacturers edged
up to 1.73 as shipments dropped somewhat further. The book value of
wholesale trade inventories rose at a $14 billion annual rate in June,
well above the $5 billion increase in the previous month.

Constant dollar inventory data for the entire manufacturing,
wholesale, and retail trade sectors are available only for May; data
for these stocks, which comprise about 80 percent of total business
inventories, suggest that most firms were operating quite successfully
to control stocks. Real inventories were liquidated at a $16 billion
annual rate during the month, following a large increase in April.
Nevertheless, the constant dollar stock-sales ratio for manufacturing
and trade rose further in May, about matching its previous cyclical
peak in March 1975, as the reduction in inventories was accompanied
by a sizable decline in real shipments and sales.
Residential Construction
Housing activity has picked up appreciably. Total private
housing starts rose 30 percent in June to 1.2 million units (SAAR).
Newly-issued building permits also increased markedly in May and June,
climbing more than 30 percent during those two months. Moreover,
early indications suggest a further substantial rise in permits for
July.
Much of the improvement has been in the single-family market.
Existing home sales rose about 8 percent in June, the first increase
after 8 consecutive months of decline. In addition, new home sales,
which had increased sharply in May, apparently registered another
sizable gain in June. These increases in sales have lessened the
pressure from unsold inventories of new units; there was a 19 percent
advance in single-family starts during June.

Multifamily starts also increased markedly in June, rising more
than 150,000 units from May's extremely depressed level. Starts of
federally subsidized rental units (HUD, Section 8) were higher in June,
and key market forces also are relatively favorable for rental construc-
tion. The rental vacancy rate rose to 5.4 percent in the second quarter
of 1980, but it remained well below the rate of 6.3 percent during the
initial stages of the 1974-75 recovery. Moreover, residential rents
have continued to rise rapidly.
Federal Government Sector
The federal government deficit for FY1980, on a unified budget
basis, is now estimated by the administration to be $61 billion, up
about $24 billion from the March forecast. Outlays--as presented in
the July Mid-Session Review--have been revised upward from $569 billion
to $579 billion, mainly because of higher spending for unemployment
compensation, disaster assistance, and national defense. (See
Appendix A for a more complete discussion of the Mid-Session Review.)
This spending estimate does not include the administration's recently
announced plan to boost agricultural price supports at a cost of about
$1 billion over the remaining two months of the 1980 fiscal year and
in fiscal 1981. On the receipts side of the budget, the Review shows
a substantial $11 billion drop in tax collections from the March
estimate, mainly due to economic developments, without counting the
additional effect of the congressional rejection of the President's
oil import fee.
For fiscal 1981, the budget outlook has been revised substantially,
in large part to reflect the impact of the recession and higher defense

II-16
expenditures. Instead of the $16 billion surplus that was expected in
March, the administration now projects a $30 billion deficit, with
receipts and outlays of $604 billion and $634 billion, respectively.
Sizable upward revisions in defense spending from the March
forecast in both fiscal years 1980 ($2 billion) and 1981 ($7 billion)
are estimated in the Review. Treasury data indicate that defense
spending has advanced at a brisk pace over the first six months of this
calendar year, reflecting higher fuel costs and increased activity in
the Persian Gulf area. The recent upsurge in defense outlays also may
reflect an increase in progress payments, following a sharp first
quarter rise in defense contract awards--a leading indicator of future
activity; the upward trend in progress payments is expected to continue
throughout the fiscal year beginning October 1.
State and Local Government Sector
Construction activity by state and local governments decreased for
the fifth consecutive month in June, with outlays down an additional
1-1/2 percent. The June figure was 15 percent below the January 1980
peak. The decline in the sector's construction activity reflects a
sharp fall-off in water, sewer and other projects that are heavily
dependent on federal grants. Over the past 6 months, spending for
these projects has dropped by one-third.
Preliminary data indicate that state and local government payroll
employment increased by about 35,000 in July, despite a further decrease
in CETA employment. CETA enrollments are now 370,000--off more than

II-17
200,000 from a year earlier. The employment gains, totaling less than
one percent since January, have been the smallest in the state and
local sector in 30 years; since January hiring has increased by less
than one percent.
Prices
The rate of increase in prices at both the producer and consumer
levels slowed considerably during the second quarter from their rapid
first quarter pace. The consumer price index for all items rose 1
percent in June, about the same as in April and May; increases in prices
of food and energy items in June were relatively small, but prices for
the housing component once again advanced sharply.
Food prices continued to exert the moderating influence on overall
prices evident since the beginning of 1980, rising 0.5 percent in June.
So far this year, food prices have been held down by declines for the
meat, poultry, fish and eggs grouping. Since mid-June, however, price
increases at the producer level for poultry and livestock have been
quite large, and these developments suggest that meat prices at the
retail level may soon begin to rise substantially. In addition, grain
and soybean prices have risen considerably in the last month in response
to drought conditions; these increases, if sustained, will also
contribute to upward pressure on food prices in the future.
Energy price increases continued to moderate in June, advancing
only 0.3 percent. Gasoline prices fell 1 percent, reflecting unusually
large inventories and reduced demand, and nearly offset the increases
in other energy items. The moderation in energy prices during the
second quarter has been a major factor in the slowing in overall prices.

Shelter costs, which have boosted consumer prices for quite some
time now, rose even more in June than earlier as a result of large
advances in rents, home prices, and mortgage interest rates. However,
FHLBB data on mortgage closing rates suggest that this CPI component
will ease significantly in July.
Increases in prices for items other than food, energy, and home-
ownership in the second quarter, while significantly below those in the
first quarter, remained somewhat above the pace recorded during 1978
and 1979. The smaller rise in these items during the second quarter
can be attributed principally to diminished pressures from higher
energy input costs, most noticeably in the production of commodities.
Continued sharp increases in labor costs have limited the deceleration,
and added to the upward pressure on most service prices.
Productivity and Labor Costs
Labor cost pressures intensified further in the second quarter,
as hourly compensation continued to advance rapidly and productivity
dropped sharply. Output per hour in the private nonfarm business
sector fell at more than a 4 percent annual rate, as a record 12-3/4
percent decline in output outweighed a large reduction in hours worked.
Productivity in the manufacturing sector fell somewhat less than in
nonfarm business, as producers of durable goods cut back hours more
sharply. These declines in productivity are about in line with the
experience in early phases of previous recessions.
Wage increases have remained high through the second quarter,
reflecting the rapid rates of price increases over the past few quarters.

fringe benefits as well as wages, rose at a 10-3/4 percent annual rate
in the second quarter. This is about the same pace as in the first
quarter, but well above the increase recorded over 1979. Combined with
the cyclical downturn in productivity, the rise in compensation pushed
the rate of increase in unit labor costs up to a 15-1/2 percent annual
rate.
In July, wages for nonfarm production workers, as measured by the
index of average hourly earnings, rose 0.2 percent following a 1.0 per-
cent rise in June. Although monthly changes in the hourly earnings
index are quite volatile and subject to upward revision, over longer
periods this measure tends to be a good indicator of underlying wage
pressures. In the second quarter the index increased at a 9.7 percent
annual rate, about 1-1/2 percentage points higher than last year, with
a particularly sharp acceleration in the rate of rise in manufacturing
wages.
Wage adjustments negotiated in major collective bargaining settle-
ments (those covering 1,000 or more workers) also accelerated somewhat
in the first half of 1980. For all major agreements reached in the
first 6 months of 1980, first-year wage increases, excluding potential
gains under cost-of-living (COLA) clauses, averaged 8.5 percent, com-
pared with 7.4 percent in 1979. In contracts that include COLA
provisions, average first-year increases were slightly above the 6-1/4
percent rise in 1979. However, in agreements without COLA clauses,
the average first-year increase was 11 percent--well above the 9 percent
increase last year; this acceleration probably reflects large "catch-
up" increases for the real income losses under expiring contracts that

APPENDIX A*
THE PRESIDENT'S JULY MID-SESSION REVIEW OF THE 1981 BUDGET
Current Budget Estimates: An Overview
On July 21, the Administration released its revised budget esti-
mates for fiscal years 1980 and 1981. Table 1 shows that the deficit
in the current fiscal year is now expected to be around $61 billion,
up by over $20 billion from both the January and the March estimates.
For fiscal year 1981, the budget outlook also has been revised sub-
stantially to reflect the impact of the recession on the budget.
Instead of the $16 billion surplus that was expected in March, the
administration now projects a deficit of $30 billion, even without a
tax cut proposal.
Economic Assumptions
Since economic conditions significantly affect budget expenditures
and receipts, the economic forecasts which accompanied the July review
provide a useful starting point for analyzing the July budget estimates.
Table 2 shows that the Administration now expects that economic growth
in 1980 will be substantially slower than was forecast in March. Spe-
cifically, real GNP is expected to decline by 3.1 percent over the four
quarters of 1980, as compared to the 0.4 percent decline expected in
March. An economic recovery is projected to begin in the final period
of this year, with real GNP climbing 2.6 percent between the final
quarter of 1980 and the fourth quarter of 1981. The recession and slow
recovery is expected to result in an unemployment rate that reaches
8.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1980 and remains at that level
through 1981. The Administration also expects the rate of inflation to
moderate from the high rates experienced during the first half of 1980.
Measured fourth quarter over fourth quarter, the consumer price index
is expected to decline from a 12 percent annual rate of increase during
1980 to a 9.8 percent rate during 1981. The Office of Management and
Budget indicated that about one-half percentage point of the expected
1981 CPI increase is due to the President's proposed tax on motor fuels
which would become effective on June 1, 1981.
The Effect of the Recession on the Budget
A recession affects both budget receipts and expenditures. There
is a fall-off in the pace of tax collections, while at the same time,
unemployment benefits and other income security payments rise in
response to higher jobless rates. These automatic responses of the
budget to the recession combine to increase the size of the deficit.
The magnitude of the budget's automatic response to a recession can be
measured in a rough way by taking the difference between the actual

Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

budget deficit which contains both automatic and discretionary changes
in the budget and the high employment budget which measures only dis-
cretionary fiscal policy initiatives. As can be seen in table 3, the
FY-1980 movement in this difference--the automatic response of the bud-
get to the recession--now is estimated to be $33 billion.1
Fiscal Year 1980
As indicated earlier, the Administration is now anticipating a
much sharper decline in economic activity during 1980 than was antici-
pated in the March Budget Update. Partly because of this, the OMB now
estimates that fiscal year 1980 receipts will be $517.9 billion, down
$14-1/2 billion from the level predicted in March. The new estimate
for outlays is $578.8 billion--$10 billion above the March estimate.
As Table 4 shows, approximately two-thirds or $10.7 billion of the
receipts revision is due to revised income projections. The most sig-
nificant tax policy change was Congressional repeal of the President's
$4.62 per barrel oil import fee. This action lowered fiscal 1980
receipts by $3.4 billion.
On the outlay side, the recession and the resulting rise in unem-
ployment increased fiscal year 1980 income security payments by $3.8
billion. (See Table 5.) Other factors which affected the spending
total included:
(1) Loans to ailing financial institutions by the FSLIC
and the FDIC and slower asset sales by GNMA ($2.0
billion).
(2) Higher defense spending because of a rise in fuel
costs and an increase in progress payments on outstanding
contracts ($1.6 billion.)
(3) Increased disaster and refugee relief resulting
from the Mount Saint Helens volcano, the new Cuban/
Haitian entrants and the Miami civil disorders
($0.9 billion).
The Administration's fiscal year 1980 spending forecast ($579
billion) is just slightly above the $578 billion total that now is pro-
jected by the FRB staff. As can be seen in Table 6, the Mid-Session
Review over-estimated actual outlays in seven out of the last eight
years and these errors have averaged around $2 billion. The July
review for fiscal year 1975, however, understated actual outlays by
more than $1 billion and this was due to the unexpected severity of the
decline in economic activity associated with the 1974-1975 recession.
1. High employment, in this case, is assumed to be consistent with a
5.1 percent unemployment rate.

A-6
Given this past history of over-estimating outlays, the FRB staff pro-
jects some small shortfall ($1 billion) from the Administration's July
estimates during the remainder of this fiscal year.
Fiscal Year 1981
The Administration's current estimate of fiscal year 1981 receipts
is $604 billion, $24 billion below the March forecast (See Table 4).
Downward revised estimates of individual and corporate incomes reduced
receipts by $18-1/2 billion. In addition, Congressional rejection of
the oil import fee lowered fiscal 1981 receipts by $12.6 billion but
some of this loss is offset by the Administration's proposal to impose
a 10 cent per gallon tax on gasoline and diesel fuels effective June 1,
1981, and by technical re-estimates.
Fiscal year 1981 outlays are now estimated by the Administration
to be $633.8 billion, up $22 billion from the "March Update". A glance
at Table 5 reveals that many of the same programs whose estimates were
revised upward for fiscal year 1980 continue to be revised higher in
the coming fiscal year, most notably, unemployment compensation,
defense, and disaster assistance.
Comparison of Administration's Fiscal Year 1981 Budget Totals with
Recent CBO Re-estimates
Finally, OMB and CBO budget estimates are compared in Table 7.
The CBO projects the fiscal year 1980 deficit at $63 billion, about
$2 billion higher than the Administration's outlook and $16 billion
higher than the revised second concurrent resolution. This later
difference is due primarily to the effect of the recession on the CBO
budget estimates. In the CBO's outlook, the unemployment rate may
average around 9 percent at the end of both 1980 and 1981. (See
Table 8.) Specifically, the CBO now estimates that, with the policies
of the first resolution (no tax cut), the 1981 budget would be in
deficit by about $30 billion. Hence, the Administration and the CBO
estimates for fiscal 1981 are essentially the same.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The monetary aggregates continued to grow rapidly in July, though
at a somewhat slower pace than in June. The recent resurgence in monetary
growth has brought the level of M-1A closer to the lower end of its
longer-run FOMC target range, the level of M-1B to its lower limit, and
the level of M-2 to near its upper bound. During the first weeks following
the July FOMC meeting, federal funds averaged between 8-1/2 and 9 percent
as nonborrowed reserve availability was sufficient to hold adjustment
borrowings at the discount window to frictional levels. In the closing
days of July, however, reserve positions tightened and the funds rate
moved toward 10 percent--the level of the recently lowered discount rate.
Other market interest rates rose with the funds rate. The increase
in rates was given added impetus by investors' concern about the impli-
cations of upward revisions in projections of the federal deficit, dis-
cussion of a possible tax cut, indications of a bottoming out of activity
in some sectors of the economy, and the accelerated growth of the monetary
aggregates. Since the July meeting, most market rates of interest have
risen 1/2 to 3/4 of a percentage point. In contrast, the bank prime rate
fell an additional 1/2 of a percentage point in July to its lowest level
since 1978, and interest rates on new home mortgage loan commitments at
savings and loans leveled out last month after declining more than 4
percentage points from their peak in April. Thus, spreads of both of
these administered rates over market rates narrowed markedly.
Aggregate credit demands by the domestic nonfinancial sectors may
have begun to firm recently as the recession in economic activity has

slowed. In the household sector, consumer installment credit outstand-
ing is estimated to have declined substantially in June, but available
data for large banks suggest a smaller decline in July. Meanwhile, mort-
gage lending appears to have turned up at banks in July, and outstanding
loan commitments at S&Ls rose in June for the first time since last Sep-
tember. In the nonfinancial business sector, although commercial paper
issuance appears to have slowed in July, business loans at commercial
banks may have expanded slightly following a near record drop in the
second quarter. In addition, financing in the corporate stock and bond
markets has continued sizable. In the public sector, Treasury and agency
borrowing jumped markedly in July, on a seasonally adjusted basis, and
state and local government financing picked up slightly.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Growth in M-1A slowed from an 11-1/2 percent annual rate in June
to a 7-3/4 percent rate in July. M-1B registered a comparable decel-
eration, but its growth in July remained well in excess of that for the
narrower measure of transaction balances. Other checkable deposits grew
$1-1/4 billion for the second straight month. This large June-July
increase occurred entirely at commercial banks, mostly at those outside
the Northeast. Many such institutions apparently are promoting ATS
accounts in order to establish strong competitive positions in the mar-
ket for interest-bearing household transaction balances in anticipation
of the nationwide extension of NOW accounts at year-end; however, a good
deal of the growth in ATS balances could simply be a reflection of the
general strengthening of flows into savings accounts.

Growth in M-2 continued very rapid during July--at an annual rate
of 16-1/4 percent--as the expansion of its nontransaction component
roughly matched the pace of the previous month. Overnight RPs, money
market mutual funds shares, and savings deposits all registered sizable
increases. At both commercial banks and thrift institutions, inflows to
savings deposits surpassed even the June surge, which had marked the end
of a year of substantial net withdrawals.
Small time deposits, in contrast, registered a slight net outflow
in July, following only a small increase in the preceding month. Avail-
able evidence suggests that the contraction in MMC balances has continued.
Until late spring, inflows of MMCs had more than accounted for the rapid
growth in small time deposits at commercial banks and thrifts, and had
raised the outstanding stock of MMCs above the declining stock of fixed
ceiling small time deposits at both types of institution. (See chart on
page 111-6.) Then, during June, MMCs declined about $9 billion on a
monthly average basis, nearly matching the stepped-up inflows to higher-
yielding SSCs, while outflows of fixed ceiling small time deposits vir-
tually ceased. During the first 20 days of July, a $4-3/4 billion net
inflow of SSCs at S&Ls was offset by a $5 billion net outflow of MMCs.
The halt in the growth of small time deposits with ceilings tied
to rates on Treasury securities--at a time when savings deposits and
other more liquid investments are expanding rapidly-may reflect both
lower yields and uncertainty among households about the economic and
financial outlook. The declining attractiveness of Treasury bill rates
to small investors also is suggested by a drop in noncompetitive tenders
at weekly bill auctions.

Partial data for July suggest a resumption of bank credit expansion
after three months of decline. The growth of security holdings accel-
erated from the already rapid pace of May and June, and loan portfolios
are estimated to have changed little following the record second-quarter
drop. Business loans apparently registered a marginal increase, with
growth at large banks offsetting continued contraction at small banks;
a more competitive prime rate relative to open market rates may have
been a contributing factor in the upturn. While real estate loans evi-
dently grew at the fastest pace since March, after a small decline in
June, security loans probably fell for the tenth consecutive month.
Loans to individuals fell in the first three weeks of July at large
banks, though less rapidly than in May and June.
Commercial banks appear to have reduced slightly further their
managed liabilities in July, reflecting the continued strength in core
deposits, a jump in government deposits, and the limited loan demands
apparent in partial data. Large time deposits continued to run off, and
available data for member banks indicate a further decline in net Euro-
dollar borrowing; the decline in these liabilities more than offset an
increase in other borrowing, particularly RPs. As a result, the bor-
rowing ratio at large commercial banks dropped further during the first
three weeks of July to 1-1/2 percentage points below the peak of last
November. (See chart on page III-9.) The liquidity ratio of large banks
dropped during the first three weeks of July to 9.4 percent (not season-
ally adjusted), its lowest level since October 1974, primarily reflecting
declines in loans to securities dealers, in gross sales of federal funds,
and in securities held in trading accounts.

1. Monthly averages of Wednesdays. The last figure, for July 1980,
excludes the last Wednesday of the month. The numerator includes gross
liabilities of banks to their foreign branches, all large time deposits,
net federal funds purchased, and borrowings from other than the Federal
Reserve. The denominator is total assets less federal funds sold and
cash items in the process of collection.
2. Monthly averages of Wednesdays. The last figure, for July 1980,
excludes the last Wednesday of the month. The numerator, liquid assets,
includes Treasury and other securities maturing in one year or less,
loans to brokers and dealers and domestic commercial banks, holdings
of bankers acceptances and gross sales of federal funds. Beginning in
1979, the numerator also includes commercial paper, all trading account
securities, as well as investment securities maturing in one year or less.
The denominator is total liabilities excluding capital accounts, valua-
tion reserves, and demand deposits due to banks.
NOTE: Beginning with January 1979, all large banks include those banks
with assets of $750 million or more on December 31, 1977. While
the number of bank3 reporting has been reduced from 317 to 171,
the share of assets for the banking system as a whole is only
slightly below that of the former panel. This applies to both
the liquidity and borrowing ratios.percent

As at commercial banks, stronger inflows of care deposits and weak
lending have permitted savings and loan associations to reduce their bor-
rowing. During the second quarter, S&Ls repaid a substantial amount of
advances from Federal Home Loan Banks and reduced other indebtedness;
in June, the ratio of borrowings to total assets was substantially below
the level reached early in the year, though it was still well above the
previous cyclical peak registered in 1974. S&Ls also increased their
holdings of liquid assets during the second quarter, raising the liquid-
ity ratio at insured S&Ls to its highest level since September 1979.
Mutual savings banks increased their liquidity ratio slightly during the
spring, but their borrowing rose as well.
Business Finance
Business credit demands have continued to be focused on long-term
markets in July, as the sum of bank business loans and commercial paper
of nonfinancial firms grew only slightly on a monthly average basis.
Gross public offerings of corporate notes and bonds totaled about $4.7
billion, seasonally adjusted, in July, down considerably from the pre-
vious month's total but still very high by past standards. The reduced
overall pace of public offerings mainly reflected a smaller slate of
issues by financial concerns, as bond issuance by utilities and indus-
trial firms was only a bit below the June volume. Despite the record
volume of publicly offered bonds in the second quarter, the estimated
ratio of short-term to long-term debt at nonfinancial corporations is
still only slightly below the all-time peak. (See chart on page III-12.)
On balance, net funds raised in markets by nonfinancial corpora-
tions slipped in the second quarter to the smallest total since the

spring of 1977, even as the financing gap remained sizable owing to
weakened profits and increased inventory accumulation. (See table on
page III-11.) Businesses met a substantial part of their cash needs by
drawing down a large fraction of the liquid assets acquired in the first
quarter in anticipation of credit controls. This drawdown produced a
marked reduction in the ratio of liquid assets to total current liabil-
ities.
Broad stock price indexes have climbed between 1 and 5 percent
since the last FOMC meeting, and have risen 20 to 45 percent since early
spring to approach or exceed previous record levels. Although price-
earnings multiples remain, on average, relatively low by historical stan-
dards, the recent improvement has encouraged a substantial number of
firms to sell new shares. July stock issuance roughly matched the strong
first-half pace.
Government Debt Markets
The Federal government must finance a large deficit in the current
quarter. The Treasury borrowed $11-1/4 billion in July through the is-
suance of marketable debt. Of this amount, nearly three-fourths was
raised in regular weekly and monthly bill auctions, and the rest was
obtained in the regular two-year note and 15-year bond offerings. It
appears likely that during the third quarter as a whole as much as two-
thirds of the Treasury's marketable borrowing--now expected to be in the
range of $24 to $27 billion--will be raised in regular auctions of bills,
an exceptionally high proportion. This would bring total borrowing
through bills during the 1980 fiscal year to about $38 billion, half of
the record total marketable borrowing for the year. The runoff in

nonmarketable Treasury debt has slowed considerably in recent months,
mainly owing to a diminution in redemptions of savings bonds and a
reversal of the redemption of special issues to foreign official insti-
tutions.
Federally sponsored credit agencies are estimated to have borrowed
about $1-1/4 billion, seasonally adjusted, in July. This compares with
no net borrowing in June and a monthly average of $1-1/2 billion in the
second quarter. Primarily to fund the agricultural mortgage financing
activities of the Federal Land Banks, the Federal Farm Credit Banks
raised $1 billion. FNMA raised slightly more than $1 billion in July
even though it purchased only a small amount of mortgages. FNMA's
July borrowing, all in debentures, likely will replace a runoff in
discount notes in August as it seeks to lengthen the maturity of its
debt. The FHLB System ran off about $900 million of its debt during
July, coincident with a decline in advances of about $1 billion.
Gross offerings of tax-exempt bonds during July totaled about $5
billion (seasonally adjusted), a shade above the June level. Issuance
of housing revenue bonds fell off last month; the proportion of these
bonds used to finance single-family housing declined to about 70 percent
in July, compared with 95 percent in the first six months of the year.
Meanwhile, sales of bonds to finance construction and improvement
projects for public utilities picked up; the proportion of large bond
issues for such purposes rose to about 30 percent in July, reversing
the downward trend in this ratio during the second quarter.1 The
1. The relative importance of bond issuance by purpose reported above
reflects data on issues of $25 million or larger, which in June and
July accounted for about 70 percent of bonds issued.

III-16
volume of short-term tax-exempt securities offered during July totaled
almost $3 billion (seasonally adjusted), including a record issuance of
HUD project notes amounting to almost $2 billion.1
Since the last FOMC meeting, yields on tax-exempt bonds have risen
more than those on taxable securities. As a result, the ratio of tax-
exempt to taxable yields increased during July, setting a new two-year
high for the second consecutive month. The upward movement in this
ratio is due in part to the reduced demand for municipal bonds by prop-
erty/casualty insurance companies which reportedly are facing increased
underwriting losses.
Mortgage Markets
Signs of a recovery in mortgage lending activity have been evident
recently at S&Ls as well as at commercial banks. Although S&L mortgage
holdings declined in June, these institutions increased their outstand-
ing loan commitments--both to originate and to purchase mortgages-for
the first time since late last summer. The pickup in S&L mortgage com-
mitments was fairly widespread by geographic region. Moreover, the fall
during July in the proportion of FHLMC-sampled S&Ls reporting the supply
of mortgage funds below normal seasonal patterns--to about 70 percent
recently from 74 percent in June and a high of 93 percent in mid-March--
increases the likelihood of future growth in commitment volume.
1. An increased demand for shorter-maturity tax-exempt paper by money
market mutual funds has given new impetus to the development and use
of tax-exempt commercial paper. Such paper is also referred to as
"short-term interim certificates of indebtedness" and is part of the
short-term category of state and local government secutities in the
table. Although such issues total less than $100 million, dealers
believe that $1 billion may be outstanding by year-end.

The second quarter increase in total mortgage debt outstanding was
only slightly more than half that in the first quarer and was the small-
est quarterly increase since 1975. (See table on page 111-19.) The home
mortgage component contracted most sharply. Net mortgage lending by non-
bank thrift institutions turned slightly negative, and lending at commer-
cial banks fell to about one-fifth of the first quarter pace. Net mort-
gage acquisitions by life insurance companies--concentrated in the non-
residential component--declined only moderately, as did activity in the
residential sector by federally related agencies and mortgage pools.
Acquisitions of residential mortgages by state and local governments are
estimated to have increased somewhat, based upon the heavy issuance of
housing revenue bonds during the quarter.
The average interest rate on new conventional mortgage commitments
at sampled S&Ls has fluctuated narrowly in recent weeks, edging up to
12.25 percent on August 1. Market reports suggest that some institutions
have raised their lending rates further in the past few days, responding
in part to the backup of secondary market yields that commenced during
the latter part of June as yields on long-term securities began to rise.
Immediate-delivery yields on GNMA-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities
issued against pools of FHA/VA home loans have increased about 90 basis
points, while average yields in FHLMC's auction of immediate-delivery
commitments to purchase conventional home loans have climbed 65 basis
points.

of 13-1/4 percent in May. Despite the phasing out of the special
restraints on consumer credit that was announced by the Board on July 3,
industry sources indicate that consumer demand for credit appears to
have continued weak. Moreover, on the supply side, several large retail
store chains have reported that they would maintain the stricter credit
policies put into effect earlier. Credit card user fees and revised
payment schedules announced by several commercial banks during the past
six months apparently remain in place or will be implemented as scheduled.
In late July, however, three major New York banks announced that they
would ease some of the restraints on consumer lending that they had
adopted when the Board's program was instituted.
Personal bankruptcy cases--spurred this year in part by the lib-
eralization of the federal bankruptcy law that took effect last October--
averaged more than 23,000 per month in April and May, up from the
advanced rate of 20,000 per month during the first quarter. Although
most consumer loan delinquency series are not yet available for the
second quarter, the special System survey on consumer credit in mid-
June suggested a broad rise in delinquencies. In any event, reflecting
the recent contraction in consumer credit outstanding, the ratio of
installment debt repayments to disposable income backed down further in
the second quarter from its peak last summer.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign exchange markets
The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dollar increased
by about 2/3 percent over the 5 week period since the last green book.
As shown in the top panel of the chart, during most of July the dollar
fluctuated in a narrow range and showed little net change. However,
in the last week of July the dollar came under strong upward pressure
and rose by over 2 percent. Nearly half of this rise was subsequently
reversed in the first week of August. The dollar's average exchange
value is currently about unchanged from its level at the beginning
of the year and is nearly 10 percent below its peak level of early
April.
Exchange market developments have continued to be dominated
by relative interest rate movements and expectations over the future
course of U.S. and foreign monetary policies. As can be seen by
comparing the upper and lower panels of the chart, the dollar's sub-
stantial depreciation in the second quarter coincided with a sharp
drop in U.S. short-term interest rates. While interest rates abroad
also moved lower over this period, the decline in foreign rates was
much smaller than in the United States, and exchange market expec-
tations of a further widening of interest rate differentials against
the dollar were prevalent. By late July, however, a change in interest
rate expectations became apparent, triggering a rise in dollar exchange
rates. There was increasing speculation in the last week of July
that U.S. interest rates had reached their low point and could move
higher, in contrast to foreign interest rates which were seen as

continuing to decline. In the first week of August expectations
shifted again against the dollar due to an easing in the Federal
funds rate.
Over the 5 week period since the last green book, the dollar
appreciated most against the Japanese yen, rising nearly 3 percent.
The yen's relative weakness was due in large part to expectations
of lower Japanese interest rates and a reduction in the Bank of
Japan's discount rate. The only major foreign currency to show a
net increase in value relative to the dollar since the last green
book was the Italian lira. The lira's strength reflected mainly
the subsiding of speculation that the lira would be devalued within
the EMS.
Net U.S. intervention over the past five weeks was about zero,
with sales of marks, Swiss francs, and French francs in the New York
market at times of selling pressure on the dollar nearly balanced
by market purchases when the dollar strengthened late in the period
and non-market foreign currency acquisitions throughout the period.
On a net basis, the Desk acquired $74 million equivalent of marks
and $123 million equivalent of Swiss francs. The marks were used
mainly to repay System swap debt to the Bundesbank, reducing out-
standing drawings to $833 million equivalent. The Swiss francs

IV-4
were added to System and Treasury balances. Sales of $61 million
equivalent of French francs were financed by a System swap drawing
on the Bank of France, raising outstanding French franc drawings
to $166 million equivalent.

IV-5
Borrowing in international capital markets. Gross borrowing in
international capital markets, which was at severely depressed levels
in the first quarter of 1980, picked up sharply in the second quarter
when dollar interest receded from earlier peaks. For the first half
of this year, total gross borrowing trailed the comparable year-earlier
level by only 10 per cent. However, the year-to-year changes in bor-
rowing volume show great differences as between country groups--in par-
ticular, borrowings by industrial countries were higher in the first
half of 1980 than a year earlier whereas those by non-oil developing
countries were 40 per cent lower. The average level of lending spreads
on Eurocurrency credits has shown little change so far this year, but
some non-oil developing countries have begun to pay substantially
higher spreads, and maturities generally have shortened.
Total gross borrowing, which had averaged $31 billion per quarter
in 1979, fell to $19 billion in the first quarter of 1980, as medium-
term Eurocredits and international bond issues (Eurobonds and foreign
bonds) felt the impact of record high levels of short- and long-term
dollar interest rates. The effects of the much higher levels of LIBOR
on the demand for loans were reinforced by the restrictions placed on
Japanese banks' international lending in October 1979 and by a more
cautious attitude by bankers following the events in Iran and Afghani-
stan and the further steep oil price increases late last year. Subse-
quently, in the second quarter of this year, total borrowing rebounded
to $34 billion, appreciably above the 1979 quarterly average, as in-
terest rates came down; both Eurocredits and bond issues advanced
sharply. Restrictions on Japanese banks were liberalized beginning

in April, although the new official "guidance" is expected to keep
Japanese banks' external foreign-currency lending in 1980 to one-half
(or somewhat less) of the 1979 level. Although total gross borrowings
in the first half of this year were 10 per cent below the year-earlier
level, the amount raised net of advance refinancings of Eurocredits ap-
pears to have declined by somewhat less--7 1/2 per cent--as advance re-
financings dropped to an estimated $3.7 billion from $5.5 billion pre-
viously.
Borrowing by industrial countries in the first half of 1980 in-
creased 12 per cent from the year-earlier level. Most of the rise was
in Eurocredits and reflected increased borrowing demands by those coun-
tries as well as the "flight to quality" by lending banks which have up-
graded the relative creditworthiness of the industrial countries group
as compared with the developing countries and Eastern Europe. Most
countries in the industrial group have borrowed more this year, in-
cluding smaller countries such as Denmark, Finland, Greece, Spain and
Sweden. Despite larger external surpluses, the OPEC countries as a
group have increased their borrowing moderately, but the increase al-
most entirely reflects larger credits to one country, Venezuela, which
has been raising new money as well as refinancing maturing credits.
Although lending to non-oil developing countries picked up in the
second quarter, the second quarter total was still well below the
quarterly average in 1978-79. The 40 per cent year-over-year decline
in lending to this group in the first half of 1980, despite larger cur-
rent account deficits in almost all cases except for Mexico, partly re-
flects less willingness by lenders to continue increasing their

IV-8
exposure to some non-oil developing countries this year in view of
worsening current account prospects. At the same time, borrowing coun-
tries have tended to resist the demands of lenders for higher spreads.
In addition, some borrowers with high reserves, including Brazil, post-
poned borrowing when LIBOR rates were very high, and such delays may not
have been entirely made up by the end of June. Other factors contribut-
ing to reduced Eurocredit lending to major LDC borrowers included the
effects of political developments on the outlook for Korea and switch-
ing by Philippine borrowers to short-term credits which do not appear
in standard data on international capital markets. A large drop in
Mexican borrowings this year appears to have resulted largely from a
reduced current account deficit as the volume and price of Mexican oil
exports have risen.
Another group to show greatly reduced borrcwing this year is the
Communist countries. Most of the decrease reflects non-repetition of
heavy ($3.4 billion) Eurocredit borrowing announced for China in 1979.
In addition, worsened prospects for Poland's debt-servicing capacity,
together with the Afghanistan situation, have contributed to reduced
lending to most Eastern European countries.
Spreads over LIBOR on Eurocurrency credits in the first six months
of 1980 show, on average, very little change from the second half of
1979, according to Federal Reserve sample data. However, spreads on
credits to some non-oil developing countries, notably Brazil and Korea,
have risen this year; on loans to Brazil, weighted average spreads
moved up from .8 per cent in the second half of 1979 to almost 1 per
cent in the second quarter of 1980, and a large loan in July to the

IV-9
Brazilian Electricity Board carried a 1-3/8 per cent spread. The drop
in the maturities of Eurocredits this year has been marked. On an un-
weighted basis, the average maturity in the Federal Reserve sample de-
creased from approximately nine years in the second half of 1979 to
about 8-1/3 and 7-1/2 years, respectively, in the first and second
quarters of 1980.

The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in the second quarter was $31
billion at an annual rate (international accounts basis), about one-
third smaller than in the first quarter. While exports were about
unchanged, imports declined by 5 per cent.

The value of oil imports in the second quarter declined by 3 per-
cent from the preceding-quarter rate. A 12 percent decrease in the
volume was nearly offset by a 10 percent price rise from the first-
quarter average. The June import price data do not yet reflect the
OPEC price hikes (about 8 percent) of mid-May and June. The rapid
stockbuilding of oil that occurred last year and early this year has
tapered off and this has contributed to the reduction in oil import
demand; on a seasonally-adjusted basis, stocks were at about the same
level at the end of June as they were at the end of March.

Nonoil imports in the second quarter decreased by about 6 percent
from the previous quarter, with a 2 percent increase in prices partly
offsetting an 8 percent decline in volume. About half of the decline in
value was concentrated in precious metals (gold and silver) and in auto-
motive imports from Canada (reflecting weak U.S. new car sales). The
remaining decline in value was accounted for by small changes in most
other major commodity categories. Automotive imports from Japan and
Europe were about unchanged in value from the first quarter rate. The
value of steel imports increased somewhat.
The value of nonagricultural exports increased by 1-1/2 percent
entirely reflecting price rises. While there were widespread increases
in the value of machinery and industrial supplies (excluding silver)
exports, these rises were largely offset by declines in silver and auto-
motive exports of Canada. Civilian aircraft exports were at about the
same strong rate as in the first quarter.

IV -12
The decrease in agricultural exports in the second quarter was
about evenly split between falling prices and volume declines. Most of
the decrease was in wheat, corn, and soybeans. Current crop conditions
here and abroad suggest that the decline in value is only temporary.
In international financial transactions, an outflow of funds
through banks that has been underway since spring continued through late
July. As shown in the accompanying table, banking offices in the United
States reduced their net Eurodollar borrowings by $18 billion, on a
daily average basis, between March and June, and partial data for July
1/
indicate further reductions. More than four-fifths of the net outflow
was accounted for by member banks. This shift toward financing of the
foreign branches of member banks occurred with little change in the
volume of deposits of U.S. nonbank customers at the foreign branches of
member banks.
Partial data for the second quarter indicate the growth in U.S.
resident deposits at foreign banking offices slowed and perhaps became
negative. This slowdown may reflect the response of investors to the
reduced yield differential on Eurodollar deposits as compared with
domestic money-market investments, such as domestic CDs, that has
accompanied a general lowering of interest rates. For example, money
market mutual funds (MMFs) increased their holdings of Eurodollar CDs
by about $600 million in the second quarter (4 percent of the increase in
1. These data differ from those in the "U.S. International Transactions"
table in that they are daily average outstanding, rather than differences
of month-end outstandings. It is estimated that the change from end-March
to end-June in U.S. banking offices net borrowings from own foreign offices
was -$16 billion.

Most of the funds raised by banking offices in the United States
in excess of bank-credit demands have been channeled to ultimate
borrowers abroad. However, since the end of April there has been a
pronounced surge of more than $2.5 billion in loans of the foreign
branches of member banks to U.S. nonbank residents; (see table), a partial
offset to the reported recent weakness in domestic bank credit. About
four fifths of this increase was accounted for by a few New York banks.

In conversations with System staff these New York banks indicated
that these loans were made under commitments that give a borrower an
option of borrowing either at the Eurodollar rate on a loan from a
foreign branch or at the prime rate on a loan from a U.S. office. Thus,
the surge in loans to U.S. residents from the foreign branches of these
banks reflect the fact that in recent months Eurodollar loans have been
considerably less expensive than prime rate loans.
2. The second-quarter increase in the Eurodollar CD holdings of MMFs
was more than offset by a reduction in the holdings of short-term unit
investment trusts (UITs). The attractiveness of this type of money-
market investment vehicle has proved to be very sensitive to the level
of interest rates -- no UIT has been created since late April. Because
three fifths of UITs' totalassetswere invested in Eurodollar CDs, their
net retirement -- more than $2 billion in the second quarter of 1980 --
is largely reflected in a reduction of U.S. residents' holdings of
Eurodollar CDs.

IV -15
Foreign official assets in the United States rose by $2.7
billion in May,
.OPEC holdings at the FRBNY have risen
about $2 billion over these two months. This increase was mostly
accounted for by an increase in one OPEC country's holdings of medium-
term Treasury notes.
In international securities transactions, the heavy foreign
purchases of U.S. corporate equities evident in the early months of
the year faded in the second quarter, while U.S. purchases of foreign
bonds appear to be reviving as borrowing costs in the United States
declined.

IV -16
Foreign Economic Developments. Inflation has shown signs of mod-
erating in almost all major foreign countries. Using CPI data and
comparing the second quarter of the year with the first quarter, infla-
tion has declined in France, Germany, and Italy. Acceleration in
quarterly rates appeared in Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom, al-
though the acceleration for the latter two was primarily the result of
high inflation in April. Looking at the past two months, CPI inflation
has declined significantly in all of the major countries but Canada. In
Japan, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom wholesale inflation improved
between the first two quarters of the year; April and May data indicate
the same will almost surely be true for Canada and France.
Second-quarter GNP data are not yet available for most countries.
However, industrial production data suggest that some weakening has
occurred in the major foreign countries. In all six countries average
industrial production in the latest two months has declined, and for all
but Italy and France industrial production has declined for two consec-
utive months.
With the exception of the United Kingdom and Canada, the major
foreign countries continue to record large current-account deficits in
recent months.
Despite signs of weakening demand and slowing inflation, authorities
abroad have been reluctant to ease their policies. The Italian govern-
ment proposed a package of generally restrictive policies. However, mar-
ket interest rates have declined, discount rates have been lowered in the
Netherlands and Belgium, and the Bank of England has reduced its Minimum
Lending Rate.

IV -17
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, signs of a weakening of demand
have emerged in recent weeks, including a flattening of consumption and
slower growth of exports, which in the latter case had been the prin-
cipal source of strength so far this year. Also, public works contracts,
as a share of authorized outlays, have been awarded so far in FY 1980 at
a rate that is the slowest since 1974. Industrial production fell
sharply in June for the second straight month; its average level in the
second quarter was only one percent (a.r.) above its first-quarter level
and far below the 8-10 percent advances recorded in most of 1979 and
early 1980.
Inflationary pressures in Japan appear to have moderated signifi-
cantly in recent months. In June, wholesale prices declined for the
second month in a row, due mainly to appreciation of the yen and lower
dollar prices for some imported commodities. Very small increases in
the CPI in June and July (0.1 and 0.2 percent, respectively) suggest that
upward pressure on consumer prices has begun to ease as well.
The current-account deficit (s.a.) widened by almost $400 million
in June, due largely to an almost $800 million increase in imports.
Despite very strong growth of exports -- particularly motor vehicles and
electronic equipment -- during the first half of the year, the first-
half current-account deficit reached almost $10 billion.
The government's monetary stance remains tight; latest figures
show M2 (in May) to have been less than 10 percent above its year-ago
level (compared with an over 12 percent rate of advance for the same
month of the previous year. The discount rate also remains at 9 percent,
despite growing concern about slower activity. Recent economic

developments in Japan suggest that the new government under Prime Minister
Suzuki -- after a major economic review later this month -- may shift its
policy emphasis somewhat away from the predominant concern of the Ohira
government over control of inflation and more toward arresting an incip-
ient slowdown in real growth.
In Germany there have been more signs of slowing economic activity
as well as slowing inflation since the last greenbook. Industrial
production declined by 2.6 percent in the second quarter, falling each
month. The volume of orders, after a very sharp drop in April, recovered
slightly in May due to a rise in orders from abroad, but domestic orders
in May remained at their low April level. The business climate index
of a major economic research institute dropped sharply in May. The rate
of unemployment (s.a.) in June remained at 3.7 percent.
Data suggest that consumer price inflation peaked early this year.
The rate of consumer price inflation was 0.5 percent each month from
April through June and dropped to 0.1 percent in July compared with a
.75 monthly average in the first quarter. The producers price index re-
mained constant and wholesale prices rose only slightly in June, while
import prices actually fell in May.
The current-account deficit widened to $1.8 billion in June bring-
ing the deficit for the first half of the year to $6.8 billion, compared
with a deficit of $5.8 billion for all of last year. Most of the in-
crease in the June deficit was due to seasonal tourist expenditures.
Inspite of mounting pressure from labor and the government, the
Bundesbank has been reluctant to ease monetary policy in the face of the
slowdown taking shape. A limited amount (5.2 billion DM) of additional

liquidity was offered the banks via open-market operations on July 28,
but the Central Bank Council has so far resisted a cut in leading inter-
est rates.
In the United Kingdom recent data indicate a continuation of the
recession that began in the first quarter of this year. Industrial
production in May and June averaged 3 percent (s.a.) below the first
quarter level. The provisional estimate of real consumer expenditure in
the second quarter showed a drop of 2.8 percent (s.a.) from the first
quarter. The unemployment rate (excluding school leavers) rose in July
to a post-war record of 6.6 percent (s.a.), considerably above the 5.7
percent figure in the first quarter of the year. In its most recent re-
port on U.K. business sentiment, the Confederation of British Industry
reported the most abrupt collapse in confidence in the outlook for the
British economy since 1973-1974.
Weakening domestic demand and the strength of sterling contributed
to a moderation in inflation rates during the most recent months. The
retail price index rose slightly less than 1 percent in both May and
June, considerably below the 1-3/4 percent average monthly inflation
rate in the first quarter of the year. In May and June price increases
for both manufactured goods and basic materials and fuels were also
considerably below those recorded earlier in the year.
The decline in domestic demand was also partly responsible for the
dramatic reduction in the U.K. current-account deficit from $1.3 billion
in the first quarter to $0.3 billion in the second quarter. A decline
in the surplus in the balance of invisibles was more than offset by a

IV -23
significant decline in the trade deficit, which reflected a sharply
lower value of imports.
On July 3 the Bank of England reduced the Minimum Lending Rate by
one percentage point to 16 percent. This move was justified by the Bank
on the grounds that credit demand was easing and the rate of growth of
sterling M3 was within the 7-11 percent target ranges. In the four
months from mid-February to mid-June, the growth rate of sterling M3 was
at the upper end of this range.
Canadian industrial production declined in both April and May, and
the index of real domestic product fell in May, suggesting that the eco-
nomic downturn whih began in the first quarter of 1980, with real GNP
falling 2 percent (s.a.a.r.), continued in the second quarter. Unemploy-
ment in June remained unchanged from May's 7.8 percent.
Consumer price inflation increased from 9 percent (a.r.) in the
first quarter to over 11.5 percent in the subsequent quarter. Although
rather erratic the past several months, there seems to be a slight
tendency toward acceleration. A recent Conference Board of Canada
survey of consumer buying intentions reports that consumer confidence fell
to an all time low in the second quarter due to increased concern about
inflation and the depth and longevity of the current economic downturn.
The Canadian trade surplus was $774 million in June. The trade
surplus for the first half of this year was nearly $2.8 billion compared
with a surplus of $3.4 billion for all of 1979.
M1 growth between the base period of 1979-Q2 and second quarter of
the current year was 3.7 percent, which is below the target range of
5-9 percent.

Almost all indicators in France reveal spreading weakness and
pessimism. French GDP growth in the first quarter fell to about 1.5
percent (s.a.a.r.) from 3.4 percent for 1979. In May industrial
production decreased by 2 percent from the average of the previous four
months, a period with some small fluctuation but no trend. Industrial
production in May was as low as any other month since June 1979. Recent
surveys by both the Bank of France and the Statistical Institute indi-
cate that orders are down, stocks are considered excessive and pessimis-
tic expectations prevail. The weakness originates in both the domestic
and external markets. Investment does seem to be above recent perform-
ance, but may not be expected to remain so in the presence of slack
demand.
The results of weak economic activity are beginning to reduce
inflation rates. In the second quarter, the retail inflation rate fell
to about 13 percent (a.r.) from 16 percent in the previous quarter;
wholesale prices were stagnant in April and declined .4 percent in May.
In the first quarter the current-account deficit was $2.5 billion,
and through the first half of the year the trade deficit was $7 billion.
These results contrast sharply with a balanced trade account for the
first half of 1979 and a $ 1/2 billion first quarter 1979 current-account
surplus. Nonetheless the franc remains strong at the top of the EMS.
Although some recent measures to aid construction have been intro-
duced, general economic stimulation has been rejected by French policy
makers.
The upswing in economic activity in Italy that characterized late
1979 and early 1980 came to an abrupt halt in the late spring as

IV -25
industrial production fell 8.2 percent from April to May (not annual
rate). After an impressive real GDP growth of 3.9 percent in 1979QIV,
Italy recorded a 1.5 percent increase for first quarter 1980.
Consumer prices slowed to 0.9 percent in both May and June from
April's 1.6 percent; wholesale price inflation reached a two-year low in
May at 0.8 percent but rebounded to 1.1 percent in June.
The external payments situation has worsened. High labor costs
and inflation have eroded Italy's export competitiveness, while the
demand for imports has grown at over 5 percent annually. Higher oil
prices and lower foreign demand have contributed to the external weakness.
The first-half trade deficit (s.a.) was over $8 billion compared with
about $.5 billion for the same period last year.
Several months of trade deficits, rising labor costs, and growing
consumer demand prompted the second Cossiga government to propose, with
opposition, the July 2 economic package directed at cooling the economy
and slowing inflation. It includes an increase in VAT, the imposition
of a withholding tax on industrial incomes, the further tightening of
credit controls, and efforts to reduce tax evasion. Interest rates con-
tinue to increase.
In the smaller countries we have seen two discount rate reductions.
In response to the continued strength of the guilder within the EMS and
the downward movement of market interest rates, the Netherlands bank
lowered its discount rate on July 21, from 9.5 percent to 9 percent.
The Belgian National Bank lowered its rate, effective July 31st, from
13 percent to 12 percent in response to declining domestic and inter-
national interest rates and satisfactory performance by the Belgian franc.

In Sweden, consumer prices rose 7.8 percent (a.r.) in the second
quarter, after a 24.2 percent increase during the first quarter. The
first quarter figure reflects increases in administered prices, such as
fuel and housing prices. In addition, part of the deceleration may be
attributed to a temporary price freeze (March 29 to May 16) which was
an unsuccessful attempt to avert a strike. The strike and associated
lock-outs idled one quarter of the labor force for two weeks; a
separate dockworkers strike lasted four additional weeks. These dis-
putes were partially responsible for the unexpectedly large ($1-1/2
billion) trade deficit in the first half of 1980. Except for the tourist
sector, all sectors of the economy seem to be recouping the output lost
in the recent strike. In Norway and Denmark there has been no evidence
of an abatement of inflation, and the monthly rate of increase of the
CPI has averaged well over 1 percent for the first five months of 1980.
