The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The upswing in economic activity continued in September. Nonfarm
payroll employment rose for a second consecutive month, as did industrial
production, and consumer spending maintained the upward trend that has
been evident since June. Housing activity continued to advance through
August, prior to the recent increases in mortgage interest rates.
Capital spending, which tends to lag other sectors cyclically, slipped
further, and evidence continues to suggest additional declines in the
near term. Increases in various indexes of prices and wages have
moderated somewhat, but underlying inflationary pressures remain strong.
Industrial Production and Employment
Industrial output has posted two consecutive months of moderate
gains after dropping 8-1/4 percent over the preceding six-month period.
The September increase--estimated at 1 percent--included a rise in auto
and truck assemblies and a second month of sharp gains in the output
of home goods and building supplies. Materials production, which had
fallen 13 percent between January and July, again advanced sharply in
September, particularly at producers of raw steel and at suppliers of
auto-related parts. With the pickup in industrial production, capacity
utilization at manufacturers increased 0.6 percentage point further in
September to 75.6 percent. Capacity utilization for producers of
industrial materials rose by a similar amount to 74.9 percent.
Reflecting the rebound in production, the demand for labor has
shown a moderate pickup. Total employment, as measured by the house-
hold survey, rose about 200,000 in September. Although this latest
improvement occurred entirely in the agricultural sector, the household

measure of nonfarm jobholders is now 400,000 higher than the June trough.
The unemployment rate edged down in September to 7.5 percent, primarily
reflecting lower joblessness among adult women and teenagers. After
rising rapidly in the spring, the unemployment rate has remained in a
7-1/2 to 7-3/4 percent range for the past five months.
Employment as measured by the payroll survey rose nearly 200,000
in September, following a slightly larger gain in August. In retail
trade, where employment dropped 95,000 during the second quarter,
increases have averaged 45,000 for the past three months. Growth in
service industry jobs also advanced in September and, together with the
retail trade gains, accounted for about two-thirds of the overall
increase last month. The remainder of the September job increase
represented a pickup in activity at contract construction sites and a
second month of rehiring at producers of durable goods, particularly
in the metal producing and fabricating industries. The total number
of manufacturing jobs has risen 175,000 since July, but remains more
than 1 million short of its previous peak in July 1979. The factory
workweek edged up 0.1 hour in September to 39-1/2 hours and was one-
half hour above its July trough.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Nominal personal income rose substantially for the second conse-
cutive month in August, following a period of little growth from March
to June. While the strength in July was attributable primarily to a
cost-of-living adjustment to social security payments, the August rise
was spurred by the first substantial gain in wages and salaries since
March. A turnaround in manufacturing payrolls led the increase in wages

and salaries. Most of the August gain in nominal income , however,
was eroded by higher prices; real disposable income is estimated to
have remained more than 1 percent below its January level. Based on
the gains reported in employment and average hourly earnings, nominal
income growth appeared to be sustained through September.
The recent increases in nominal income have supported the firming
of consumer spending that began in June. This upswing also probably
reflects the easing of credit restraints and an improvement in consumer
attitudes about the near-term economic outlook. In September, sales
of new domestic-model autos were at a 6.6 million unit annual rate--
a slight improvement from July and August, and more than 1 million units
above the depressed selling pace in the second quarter. A variety of
year-end discounts and rebates, as well as the introduction by General
Motors of their 1981 models on September 25, contributed to the higher
sales. In the first ten days of October, when 1981 models were
generally available, sales of new, domestic cars were at a 6.8 million
unit rate. Foreign car sales in September held steady at a 2.1 million
unit rate; this selling pace represents some fallback from the record
market share taken by imports earlier in the year.
Nominal retail sales excluding autos and nonconsumption items
rose 0.9 percent in September, the fourth consecutive monthly increase.
Increases in these sales in real terms have diminished over the last
two months. Spending in nominal terms at the general merchandise,
apparel, and furniture grouping of stores was about unchanged last
month, while outlays at food stores and gasoline service stations rose
sharply.

Consistent with the recent data on consumer spending, the composite
measures of consumer confidence reported by both the University of
Michigan Survey Research Center and Conference Board have advanced
steadily since May. According to the surveys, consumers continued to
report greater optimism in September about the near-term business out-
look and about their personal financial situations. However, attitudes
toward house purchases, which had exhibited a marked improvement in
the Michigan survey in recent months, fell back somewhat in the
September report because respondents expected further increases in
mortgage interest rates.
Residential Construction
According to available data, the upswing in housing activity,
evident since May, continued through August and probably into early
September. The rebound apparently reflected strong underlying demand
pressures as well as more favorable financial conditions that prevailed
prior to the recent runup in mortgage credit costs. Total housing
starts rose further in August to an annual rate of 1.4 million units--
a pace about one-third above the cyclical low in 1980:Q2. Newly-issued
building permits increased for the fourth consecutive month in August
to a level 50 percent above the second-quarter average. Advance reports
show another increase in permits during the first two weeks of September.
The continued recovery in housing activity during August was
fairly widespread by sector and region. Although the bulk of the
advance in housing starts in August took place in the West, all regions
except the Northeast have bounced back considerably since last spring.

Starts in the multifamily sector rose substantially in August, perhaps
reflecting the push in HUD-subsidized (Section 8) starts as fiscal year
1980 ended. The advance in single-family starts to almost a one million
unit annual rate in August brought the cumulative increase in that
sector since May to more than 50 percent. The latest gain came despite
a 5 percent decrease in sales of new houses by merchant builders in
August; meanwhile, the stock of unsold new houses at the end of August
edged down to the lowest level in four and a half years. In contrast
to new homes, sales of existing homes rose further.
The recent strength in housing demand has supported price increases
in housing markets. Average prices of both new and existing houses
sold have increased at more than a 25 percent annual rate from last
spring through August. From August 1979 through May 1980 when mortgage
interest rates were rising rapidly, prices of new houses declined
slightly, partly due to a shift in the mix of sales, and prices of
existing houses increased at a slower rate than over the preceding year.
Business Fixed Investment
Indicators of business capital spending in August suggest that the
slide in real investment, which began in the spring, is continuing--
particularly in the construction area. In constant-dollar terms, non-
residential construction fell 3.1 percent in August, following an even
larger drop in July; the August level of this spending was 9.6 percent
below the second-quarter average. As in July, the August decline in
construction was centered in the industrial and nonoffice commercial
building categories. In contrast, oil- and gas-well drilling--a
component of spending on nonresidential structures in the national
income and product accounts--continued to expand.

Business spending on equipment also has declined recently. After
rising in July, shipments of nondefense capital goods in real terms fell
back in August. In contrast, business purchases of motor vehicles con-
tinued to advance in August, the third consecutive month of increase,
as sales of heavy-weight trucks rose by 30,000 units. Although truck
purchases have improved recently, they still are below the first-quarter
rate and well below 1979 sales.
Commitments data for near-term business investment point to reduced
levels of real capital spending in the coming months. New orders for
nondefense capital goods fell substantially in August to a level about
10 percent below that of the first quarter of 1980. In addition, the
backlog of unfilled orders for these goods fell in August for the third
time in the past four months, and the ratio of unfilled orders to ship-
ments declined further from the high levels of the spring, particularly
in the machinery area. Contracts for commercial and industrial building
and nonbuilding construction projects increased sharply in August, but
this rise was mostly the result of contract awards for several nuclear
power plants whose construction will take a number of years. The
dollar volume of commercial and industrial building contracts in
August (See chart.) remained near the levels that have prevailed since
the middle of 1978. This sustained stagnation suggests that there is
little likelihood of nonresidential construction advancing above the
levels seen earlier this year, especially in real terms.
Over the longer run, commitments data suggest continued weakness
in capital outlays into 1981. Capital appropriations by manufacturers
fell almost 13 percent in the second quarter and, excluding the volatile

petroleum sector, the falloff was even more pronounced. Private
utilities increased their appropriations 88 percent net of cancellations
in the second quarter; this rise largely reflects reappropriations for
nuclear power projects that had been canceled after the Three-Mile-
Island incident, rather than any broad-based surge in the demand for
capital.
Inventory Investment
Inventory developments suggest, on balance, that firms have been
relatively successful in reducing the real volume of stocks. The book
value of manufacturing and trade inventories rose at a $23-1/4 billion
annual rate in August, following a $29-3/4 billion rate increase in
July. In August, the rise in nominal inventories was accompanied by a
1.4 percent advance in shipments and sales. As a result, the stock-
sales ratio for the entire manufacturing and trade sector edged down to
1.47.
Most of the August slowdown in inventory accumulation was attrib-
utable to a fall in the book value of manufacturers' stocks. This
decline followed two months of relatively low rates of accumulation,
and was the first actual drop in the book value of inventories at
manufacturers since the beginning of the downturn early in the year.
Reductions of stocks occurred at producers of motor vehicles, electrical
machinery, primary metals, and most nondurable goods, while a sizable
increase occurred at producers of aircraft, missiles, and parts. In
contrast to developments at manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers,
who tend to adjust their stocks more quickly to changes in sales, added
to their inventories in July and August. At retailers, the book value

II-18
of stocks rose at a $5-1/2 billion annual rate in August, with inven-
tories of automotive stores up quite sharply after five months of
decline. The book value ratio of retail inventories to sales was
about unchanged in August and a little below the relatively high level
in the second quarter. A significant portion of the large accumula-
tion at wholesalers in August and July was in raw farm products.
Government Sector
The deficit for the fiscal year just completed (FY1980) is still
expected to be fairly close to the administration's mid-year forecast
of about $60 billion. Preliminary Treasury data indicate that outlays
will be around the July estimate of $578 billion; spending for veterans'
benefits and some income transfer payments was more than anticipated
while payments for unemployment compensation were smaller. Personal
income and social security taxes during August and September were
slightly larger than the Treasury had expected in its earlier projection,
probably reflecting the gradual pickup in employment.
For fiscal year 1981, the administration is in the process of
revising its deficit estimate in conjunction with the autumn budget
review. Indications are that the fiscal 1981 deficit will be sharply
higher than the $36 billion estimate that accompanied the President's
economic revitalization proposal. Because of several difficulties,
the Budget Committees decided to postpone action on the Second Con-
current Budget Resolution until after the November elections. To carry
on the federal government's operations, the House and Senate--after a
lengthy debate--passed a continuing resolution to fund programs through
December 15 at a rate equivalent to the lower of their 1980 rate or

II-19
that proposed in the House appropriation bill. The Defense Department,
however, was permitted to obligate funds at the higher rate in the
House's proposed 1981 appropriation.
At the state and local level, recent spending remained about
unchanged, as teacher strike activity held down growth in payrolls and
capital investment outlays continued their downward trend. In
September, state and local government payrolls were little changed,
with about 27,000 teachers on strike. Overall hiring in this sector
so far this year has risen at only a 1 percent annual rate, the lowest
in these decades and about half the already reduced pace of recent
years. The recent small employment rise stems in part to a winding
down of enrollments in public service jobs funded under the CETA pro-
gram. Construction outlays by state and local governments dropped 4
percent in August, continuing their downward trend evident since the
beginning of the year. This decline was due to a sharp reduction in
highway projects and a fall-off in the number of water and sewer
projects.
Prices and Wages
Measures of price change have shown volatile movements in recent
months, primarily due to developments affecting food prices and home-
ownership costs. In September, producer prices of finished goods declined
slightly, after two months of large increases. Consumer prices rose
at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate in August, after being unchanged in
July. Excluding food and homeownership, price increases have moderated
from the rapid pace earlier in the year as the rise in energy prices has
eased dramatically; nevertheless, underlying price pressures remain
strong.

Cutbacks in livestock and poultry supplies, along with the drought,
contributed to the sharp increases in prices of farm products and food
this summer. Retail food prices accelerated to more than a 20 percent
annual rate in August, led by steep advances in the prices of meats and
fresh fruits and vegetables. The producer price index for consumer
foods turned down slightly in September. However, food prices are
expected to increase at a relatively rapid rate into 1981, reflecting
prospects for further reductions in meat supplies. Recent food price
and agricultural supply developments are discussed more fully in
Appendix II-A.
Homeownership costs fell somewhat further in August, after
declining sharply in July, and helped to contain the overall rise in
consumer prices. The August drop in the CPI measure of mortgage rates
was smaller than in July and was nearly offset by the acceleration in
house prices. Available FHLBB survey data on loans closed suggest
some additional decline in the CPI mortgage rate index for September
despite the one-half percentage point rise in FHA/VA ceiling rates.
However, the recent rise in commitment rates will begin to boost the
CPI again in October.
Excluding the food, energy, and homeownership categories, the
consumer price index continued to increase at about an 8 percent rate
in August. While this pace exceeds the 1979 increase of 7-1/2 percent,
it remains well below that of the first quarter of this year, when the
passthrough of rapidly escalating energy costs contributed significantly
to price increases for many goods and services. At the producer
level, the rate of increase in the index for finished goods less
food and energy also decelerated from the first quarter pace, but

it still rose at about a 9 percent annual rate over the third quarter.
In September, this index declined somewhat, reflecting a sharp decline
in prices for passenger cars and trucks because of substantial liqui-
dation allowances to dealers on 1980 models. Although automakers
typically offer discounts at the end of the model year, this was the
first time data were available for inclusion in the producer price
index.
Wage increases also appeared to have moderated in recent months,
although underlying wage pressures remain strong. Wage rates as
measured by the hourly earnings index, which has been frequently
revised upward, rose at an 8-1/4 percent annual rate in the third quarter--
down from the 9-3/4 percent rate over the first half of the year. With
the exception of the trade sector, some deceleration in wage changes
occurred in most nonmanufacturing industries. Manufacturing wages
also slowed somewhat, but still rose at a rapid 11-1/2 percent annual
rate in the third quarter.

APPENDIX II-A*
RECENT FOOD PRICE AND AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY DEVELOPMENTS
Consumer food prices have accelerated sharply in recent months,
following a year in which food price increases were generally smaller
than increases in overall consumer prices. As shown in table 1, the
recent pickup in food price inflation has mainly reflected very large
price advances for meats and related products and for fruits and vege-
tables. On balance, prices for other food items, which make up about
two-thirds of total food in the CPI, increased in July and August at
about the same rapid pace as over the previous two and a half years.
The recent acceleration in fruit and vegetable prices reflects a
variety of developments in markets for specific items. Retail apple
prices, bolstered by strong demand, increased sharply in August to a
level about one-fourth above a year earlier. Prices for oranges and
some other fruits have rebounded following sizable declines in late
1979 and early 1980. Potato farmers, responding to the relatively low
prices of the past couple years, reduced acreage for fall harvest by
nearly one-tenth from 1979, and retail potato prices have risen by about
40 percent (not at an annual rate) in the past two months alone.
Supply developments appear to account for much of the recent turn-
around in meat prices. As shown in table 2, pork production fell off
sharply in the third quarter of 1980, following an earlier strong expan-
sion. Poultry supplies also declined for the second quarter in a row.
To a considerable extent, the cutbacks in pork and poultry produc-
tion have been in the works for some time. Prices received by farmers
for these products fell sharply in mid-1979 and remained low through the
first half of 1980. As prices fell, farmers began reducing breeding
inventories in order to curtail output. Because of biological time
lags--especially for pork--these planned cutbacks in production did not
immediately show up at the retail level, but have begun to do so this
past summer. Severe drought across several regions of the U.S. during
July and August reduced supplies still further.
Cyclical contractions in pork production typically last for several
quarters, and current indications are that retail pork supplies will
continue trending lower at least into mid-1981. This summer's drought--
by raising feed prices--will probably cause this contraction to last
longer and be deeper than would otherwise have been the case. Of course,
it will not in fact be possible to disentangle this drought effect from
the normal inventory correction that would have occurred anyway.
The falloff in pork production is likely to exert a significant
influence on consumer prices in the coming year. During past contrac-
tions in pork production, almost without exception, retail meat prices

have risen considerably faster than overall consumer prices, a pattern
that most analysts expect to be repeated during the current contraction.
Poultry and beef supply prospects are not so unfavorable. Advance
supply indicators suggest that arenewed expansion in poultry output may
already be underway at the farm level, and, if so, the current drop in
retail supplies should be of relatively short duration.
In addition, the long-run cyclical contraction which dominated the
cattle industry through the late 1970's appears to have bottomed out,
and, as shown in the top line of table 2, beef production--though volatile
from quarter to quarter--has essentially been on a plateau since mid-1979.
Qualitative reports indicate that third quarter production--though down
slightly from 1980-Q2--may have been supported in part by the drought-
induced slaughter of some cattle. However, there does not appear to have
been a widespread selloff of breeding stock, so that the base for a
renewed moderate expansion in the nation's cattle herd is probably still
intact.
Farm crop production in 1980 (table 3) is off significantly from
the increasingly bountiful harvests of the 1975-79 period. Since the
1979 harvest was exceptionally good, some declines in 1980 crop produc-
tion had been widely expected even prior to the summer drought. However,
initial expectations still proved to be too optimistic, and crop prospects
declined substantially as the drought lengthened.
The Department of Agriculture's most recent crop estimates are
shown in the last column of table 3. Based on conditions as of October 1,
USDA expects the production of corn--the major feed crop--to be off 17
percent from 1979. Owing to severe crop losses in the southern and
central plains states, sorghum production is down even more sharply, and
consequently total feed grain production has fallen to its lowest level
since 1975. Production of soybeans and cotton is also down significantly
this year, and of the crops shown in the table, only the early-maturing
wheat crop escaped the ravages of drought.
Fortunately, large inventories of grains and soybeans had been
accumulated from earlier harvests, and consumption over the next year can
be maintained at relatively high levels by drawing down these inventories,
a large portion of which are currently owned or financed by the Commodity
Credit Corporation. As shown in table 4, the Agriculture Department is
currently projecting that total feed grain use in the 1980-81 marketing
year will be down 2 percent from 1979-80, a relatively small decline
compared to the 18 percent drop in total feed grain production. As
shown in the middle columns of the table, USDA is also estimating that
the decline in soybean consumption will be considerably less than the
steep drop in production. Cotton inventories are currently less plentiful,
and as a result of this year's crop losses, consumption will need to be
cut back sharply. While these specific projections for the various crops
are still problematical, it is clear that far greater consumption cutbacks
would have been required but for the large stocks built up in recent years.

Even so, inventories were not large enough to prevent crop prices
(shown in chart) from rising sharply as the summer drought worsened.
Corn and soybean prices stabilized somewhat in late September and early
October as the harvest got into full swing and the danger of an early
frost passed; however, prices began rising again in mid-October following
reports of export negotiations with China and a further downward revision
in USDA crop estimates. With inventories certain to be drawn down in
coming months, another bad crop in 1981 would likely result in quite
sizable cutbacks in consumption in the 1981-82 marketing year. Hence,
farm crop prices in the coming year are likely to be extremely sensitive
both to export developments and to planting and growing conditions for
the 1981 crop.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Market interest rates have moved over a considerable range since
the last FOMC meeting. Most rates rose substantially during the latter
half of September, reflecting a tightening of bank reserve positions
and a percentage point increase in the discount rate, as well as the
effects on market expectations of strong monetary expansion. As pub-
lished data in early October showed drops in the narrow money stock
measures, market sentiment improved and market interest rates fluctuated
thereafter around somewhat lower levels. On balance over the intermeeting
period, yields on most short-term market instruments have risen 50 to 150
basis points while yields on corporate and municipal bonds have increased
less and long-term Treasury yields have declined slightly. The prime
rate at most large banks has been raised by 1-1/4 percentage points as
banks have reacted to rising costs of funds and strong loan demand.
Average rates on new home mortgage commitments at S&Ls have climbed by
65 basis points.
Although growth in the narrow monetary aggregates for the month of
September as a whole was at double-digit rates, it was appreciably slower
than in August. M-2 expansion also slowed, with a deceleration in the
growth of savings and small time deposits and an absolute decline in
shares of money market mutual funds. Commercial banks increased their
managed liabilities to help finance another large increase in bank credit,
led by business loans.
Total funds raised in financial markets by business evidently slack-
ened somewhat in September as stock offerings changed little while a sharp
decline in bond offerings outweighed an increase in bank loans plus

commercial paper. Funds raised by households, however, probably rose
further, given the growth in mortgage commitments at thrift institutions
during August and a pickup in consumer lending at large commercial banks
in September. Total borrowing by state and local governments increased
moderately last month, and Treasury borrowing remained quite substantial.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The 12-1/2 percent annual rate of growth in September after a 19-1/4
percent increase in August resulted in an average rate of M-1A expansion
during the two months that was the highest on record. The increase in
M-1B over this period also set a record, with the gap between M-1A and
M-1B growth rates remaining large as other checkable deposits continued
to expand rapidly. For the third quarter, the rapid growth of the narrow
monetary aggregates appears to have been only moderately faster than
might have been expected on the basis of historical money demand relation-
ships, particularly as measured by the Board's quarterly econometric
model. The public's desired transaction balances presumably were enlarged
by the turnaround in economic activity and the sharp decline in interest
rates over the second quarter.
Growth in M-2 exceeded the pace of the narrow monetary aggregates
for the third quarter as a whole, but slowed in September to an 8 percent
annual rate as the nontransactions component weakened sharply further.
Reflecting the general rise in market interest rates, growth of savings
deposits slowed markedly in September at all types of depository insti-
tutions, more than offsetting a strengthening of inflows to small time
deposits. Within the small time deposit category, inflows to the

relatively high-yield SSCs increased substantially while MMC levels edged
up for the first time in five months.
Money market mutual fund shares fell from mid-August through Septem-
ber, but rose in the first full week of October. The decline occurred as
the net return on shares lagged considerably the rise in yields on competing
short-term instruments, owing to average portfolio maturities of 40 to 50
days (see chart on page III-6). About 85 percent of the decline in shares
occurred at institution-only money funds, strongly suggesting that much of
the shift was into other money market instruments rather than into small-
denomination deposits, although flows to other types of funds also have
slackened. The increased attractiveness of Treasury bills is evident in
the marked rise of noncompetitive tenders since mid-August.
Growth of required reserves picked up to a 24-1/2 percent annual
rate during September as a result of the strong expansion of reservable
deposits in August and September. With excess reserves falling slightly
during the month, total reserves expanded at a 23 percent annual rate.
Growth of nonborrowed reserves decelerated during September to a 3-3/4
percent annual rate, and adjustment credit borrowing at the discount
window rose to $1-1/4 billion while the federal funds rate climbed well
above the 10 percent discount rate that prevailed prior to the hike to 11
percent on September 26.

Growth in total commercial bank credit remained quite brisk in
September, although moderating slightly from the August pace as banks
reduced their acquisitions of Treasury and other securities. Total loans
at commercial banks grew at a 16-1/4 percent annual rate, the most rapid
pace since February, with growth in business loans accelerating further
to a 23-3/4 percent rate. Real estate loan growth increased slightly,
and loans to individuals at large banks rose for the first time in six
months.
To fund rapid credit growth in the face of a slowdown in the
expansion of core deposits, commercial banks increased their managed
liabilities substantially in September, following five consecutive months
of decline. Large-denomination CDs rose $4.4 billion, and total non-
deposit funds increased as well even though domestically chartered banks
further reduced their net Eurodollar borrowings and moved their net
claims position against their foreign branches to a near-record $13.9
billion. Since March, these banks have shifted $23.2 billion to their
foreign branches; over the same period, foreign related institutions
located in the United States reduced their net borrowing from their
foreign offices by an estimated $3.6 billion. This pattern reflects
the rise in the cost of Eurodollar funds above domestic CD rates (adjusted
for reserve requirements) which emerged in April and persisted through
September.

September was accompanied by a somewhat smaller decline than in August

in outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial businesses. Growth in
the sum of these measures increased to an 18-1/4 percent annual rate,
the most rapid pace since early this year.
The recent pattern of growth in bank business loans and nonfinan-
cial commercial paper reflects in part the narrowing of the spread of
the prime rate over commercial paper rates: the average spread (based
on 30-day paper rates) declined to about 140 basis points in September
from more than 400 points in June. Moreover, large banks have become
more willing to make very sizable short-term loans at interest rates
that are linked to money market yields and fall below the posted prime.
According to the most recent Survey of Terms of Bank Lending, taken in
early August, there was a noticeable increase in the share of loans made
below the prime rate at large banks as well as a substantial decline in
the average maturity of short-term business loans.1
The strength of shorter-term borrowing apparently resulted in part
from the deterioration of conditions in long-term markets. Corporate
bond yields increased sharply during the latter half of September,
reaching a level only about 1 percentage point below the record high
posted in March; since then, they have declined somewhat. Public offer-
ings of corporate bonds fell in September to the lowest monthly total
since March as a number of issues were postponed. Gross offerings totaled
only $2.2 billion (SA), compared with $4.4 billion in August, with issuance
1. At 48 large banks, 58 percent of gross short-term loan extensions in
early August were made at rates below prime, up from 53 percent in May
and 37 percent a year earlier.

by nonfinancial corporations falling sharply. The relatively high levels
of both bond yields and stock prices continued to stimulate the issuance
of convertible bonds. Nearly two-fifths of industrial bond offerings
in September were convertible issues carrying less than A ratings.
Stock prices have increased moderately on balance since the September
FOMC meeting and most broad indexes remain close to their historic highs.
The relatively high level of stock prices continued to induce a large
volume of equity financing in September. New common and preferred stock
offerings totaled $1.5 billion (SA), about equal to the average monthly
rate for the two previous months.
Government Finance
The Treasury raised $7.1 billion of new money (payment basis) during
September through sales of marketable debt, almost entirely in its regular
note sales.1 For the third quarter as a whole, the Treasury's net cash
borrowing from the public totaled about $27 billion, as the Treasury
financed a deficit of about $20.5 billion and realized a large increase
in its cash balance. During the quarter, the public redeemed about $300
million of savings bonds and notes, compared with redemptions of $3.9
billion and $2.7 billion in the first and second quarters, respectively,
when market rates of interest were much further above yields on these
non-marketable instruments.2
1. As shown in the table, net offerings of Treasury securities surged
in August and fell sharply in September, reflecting a large volume of
offerings in late August for payment in early September.
2. The Congress recently gave the Treasury new powers to make savings
bonds competitive with other financial instruments. As of November 1,
the yield to maturity on Series EE bonds will be raised from 7 percent
to 8 percent.

Early in the fourth quarter, the Treasury auctioned $1.5 billion
of 15-year bonds, all for new money.1 For the fourth quarter as a
whole, the Treasury is expected to run a combined deficit of nearly $30
billion. Nevertheless, the volume of net cash borrowing by the Treasury
is expected to be about the same as in the third quarter, and the
Treasury's cash balance is expected to decline.
Federally sponsored credit agencies borrowed about $1.6 billion
during the month of September (seasonally adjusted offerings basis) after
raising almost no new money, on balance, during the two previous months.
After paying down a total of $1.6 billion of debt in July and August,
the FHLBanks raised $800 million in September, reflecting a pickup in
advances to S&Ls. FNMA, on the other hand, continued to make moderate
net paydowns of debt during September. The Federal Farm Credit Banks
borrowed about $900 million in September, about the same as the average
rate during the prior months of the year.
Gross offerings of long-term tax-exempt securities increased to
$5.7 billion (SA) in September from $3.8 billion in August. Public
utility and general-purpose state issues accounted for much of the
increase and represented an unusually large 40 percent of the September
volume. About $800 million of tax-exempt bond offerings were cancelled
or postponed during the month, and about two-thirds of these were
housing bonds. Most of the housing bond displacements were caused
1. In early October, Congress raised the statutory ceiling on the amount
of publicly held bonds outstanding that carry a coupon rate above 4-1/4
percent. Since the ceiling had been reached during the August refunding,
congressional action was needed to permit the bond sale in October.

by statutory interest rate limitations; about half the states have rate
limits of 10 percent or less on local revenue bond issues, and the Bond
Buyer revenue bond index reached 10 percent in late September.
Indexes of rates on tax-exempt issues are about 20 basis points
higher than in mid-September, and are within 30 to 40 basis points of the
record levels reached last spring. The ratio of tax-exempt to taxable
yields has risen markedly since February; in September, this ratio was
the highest since June 1976, although it remained well below the record
high reached in late 1975 when the municipal market was affected by the
New York City crisis (see chart on page III-14). Reductions in demand
for longer-term instruments by the major institutional investors that
traditionally purchase tax-exempt securities-property/casualty insurance
companies and commercial banks-evidently are putting unusual upward
pressure on tax-exempt bond rates. Moreover, the insurance companies
apparently are purchasing fewer municipal securities generally because
underwriting losses have reduced their need for tax-exempt income.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on long-term mortgages in the primary market and on
short-term construction loans and warehousing credit have increased sig-
nificantly since the last FOMC meeting. According to field reports and
trade sources, interest rates have reached a level that has stalled the
recovery in mortgage commitment volume at the nonbank thrift institutions
which had commenced in June. Until very recently, the spread between
yields on long-term home mortgages and bonds was quite narrow, providing
limited incentive for diversified institutions to channel large portions

of their investible funds into comparatively illiquid mortgage loans.
Support provided by the federally related agencies operating in the
secondary markets also has continued modest, although issues of GNMA-
guaranteed passthrough securities were well maintained through September.
Issues of mortgage revenue bonds by municipalities have been reduced
considerably since mid-year, largely because of the constraints imposed
by statutory interest rate ceilings.
Yields on long-term mortgage instruments traded in the secondary
markets generally rose sharply during the latter half of September but
have come down markedly since then. As secondary market yields for
FHA/VA loans climbed last month, the administration raised the ceiling
rates on government-underwritten home loans by a full percentage point
on September 22. By mid-October, GNMA-guaranteed securities issued
against pools of FHA/VA loans bearing the new 13 percent ceiling rate
were selling about 2 points below par.
In the primary market for conventional home mortgages, the national
average contract rate on new commitments for fixed-rate level-payment
loans at S&Ls has risen by 65 basis points since mid-September to 13.73
percent. S&Ls are offering renegotiable-rate or "rollover" mortgages
(authorized by the FHLBB in April) in some areas of the country at 1/2
to 1 percentage point below going rates on fixed-rate loans, but customer
reaction reportedly is mixed. Moreover, there has been some experimenta-
tion with so-called "shared appreciation" home mortgages bearing contract
interest rates about a third less than market yields on standard contracts.

III-18
On September 30, the FHLBB issued proposed regulations permitting S&L
activity in this type of lending.1
In August (latest data available), net mortgage lending by S&Ls
surged to $3.6 billion (SA) and the volume of new mortgage commitments
issued rose to $9.6 billion. The stock of mortgage commitments outstand-
ing increased by 13 percent to $26.8 billion, a level about 40 percent
above the May trough but nearly a fifth below the peak last fall. S&Ls
increased their borrowing from FHLBanks and other sources in August,
following four consecutive months of decline, although they also increased
their liquid asset balances. S&Ls have improved their balance sheet posi-
tions since early this year as the flow of funds from deposits and mortgage
repayments generally has exceeded net acquisitions of mortgages by the
associations.
Average contract interest rates on all types of conventional home
loans closed by major lender groups increased by about 10 basis points
in September following 3 months of decline from the May peak. This rise,
along with the September 22 increase in the FHA/VA ceilings, will be
incorporated in the CPI for October; mortgage rate adjustments, which were
a moderating factor in the CPI change during the July-September period,
will contribute about a plus two-tenths of 1 percent to the index for
October. The third-quarter decline in interest rates on mortgage loans
closed brought a halt to the marked upswing in average monthly payments
1. These contracts entitle the lender to a share of any capital gain on
the mortgaged property. The FHLBB also issued proposed regulations
concerning a "graduated payment adjustable mortgage," which combines the
adjustable-interest-rate feature of rollover mortgages with a graduated-
payment feature attractive to many first-time homebuyers.

III-19
on newly originated conventional home loans which had been evident for
more than two years. Recent increases in commitment rates along with
accelerating home prices, however, are likely to produce some rise in
the payment/income ratio in the fourth quarter.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding expanded slightly in August,
following four months of substantial decline. Growth in August primarily
reflected continued strength in finance company auto lending and modest
gains in revolving credit at retailers and gasoline companies, which offset
continuing declines for all major loan types at commercial banks and credit
unions. The reductions at these latter holders, however, were much smaller
than during the four preceding months.1
Finance rates on auto credit have moved down substantially at both
commercial banks and finance companies since the spring. Moreover, the
proportion of commercial bank new-auto loans with contract maturities longer
than 36 months rose during August, and the average loan/value ratio on new-
auto loans at finance companies increased significantly.
A special survey of auto financing at commercial banks and finance
companies, conducted in mid-September by the Federal Reserve Banks, showed
that about one-fifth of respondents had changed their finance rates since
mid-August, and rates were reduced in a large majority of these cases. A
follow-up telephone sampling of a limited number of banks in early October
found that a few had raised finance rates in the preceding two to three
weeks but none reported any other change in lending policy. Some banks
indicated that they were considering raising auto credit finance rates
if the recent rise in market interest rates persisted.

APPENDIX III-A*
RECENT CONSUMER CREDIT DEVELOPMENTS
After expanding at a rapid rate from 1977 through mid-1979, and
more moderately during the next several months, consumer installment
credit outstanding began to fall sharply in April of this year. The
decline abated considerably in July, however, and a slight increase
was registered in August. Brief contractions in consumer credit typically
occur during a recession (see chart on page III-A-2). In such periods,
when sales of autos and other consumer durables weaken, new extensions
of credit generally drop below the more stable volume of repayments,
and the stock of debt falls.
The most striking feature of the recent decline in credit is its
comparative depth. Credit outstanding fell at an annual rate of 13
percent in May and June, in contrast to rates of decline of 5 percent or
less at previous low points. Contributing to the recent large contrac-
tion, gross extensions of new credit dropped as much as 25 percent below
the previous peak (see chart on page III-A-3, upper panel), compared with
peak-to-trough slides measuring no more than 10 percent during earlier
recessions.
Contractions in consumer credit outstanding generally have lasted
from 4 to 8 months; the most recent drop apparently has lasted or 4
months. It could be premature to conclude that the small August increase
has ended the current contraction, since some months of positive growth
have cropped up within a negative trend in the past. However, the
strengthening of retail sales since June, and the emergence of a more
normal relationship between credit extensions and retail sales, both
point to this conclusion (see chart on page III-A-3, lower panel).
An obvious difference between the recent and previous recession
periods was the existence from mid-March to July of this year of the
consumer credit restraint program, which undoubtedly contributed to the
severity of the decline in credit. Many lenders tightened credit policies
substantially when the program was in effect; at the same time consumers
themselves acted to reduce their reliance on credit. In addition to the
restraint program, however, another factor--not so important in past
recessions--served to intensify the recent credit contraction. Unusually
high market interest rates, together with low usury ceilings in many
states, had rendered relative returns on consumer lending less attractive
since mid-1979 than around most other cyclical turning points. That was
the case even though average rates on consumer loans made also climbed
to record levels (see charts on page III-A-4).

III-A-5
When the restraint program was initiated, creditors already inclined
to curtail consumer lending found in the program a convenient opportunity
to do so with a minimum of customer alienation or competitive pressure.
In this environment, constraint on the availability of funds likely played
a more prominent role in the recent decline in credit than it had in the
past. Qualitative evidence has indicated that willingness to lend
increased on balance between May and August, which was reflected in the
pullback in consumer finance rates reported for the middle of the third
quarter. Finance rates appear to have firmed a bit in recent weeks, but
not sharply.
The discussion below considers several aspects of household finan-
cial condition that may shed light on the capacity of households to
contribute to economic recovery. In rebuilding their real financial net
worth after the last recession, households recovered less than half
the ground lost in 1973-74, suggesting that they approached the recent
recession in generally less liquid condition than in the past (see chart
on page III-A-6, upper panel). During these years, inflation was eroding
the worth of fixed nominal-value financial assets in consumer portfolios,
and balance sheets were being restructured toward greater emphasis on
tangible assets. Financial net worth after 1976 was also retarded by the
rapid accumulation of consumer and mortgage debt, of which a growing
proportion went to support consumption spending--an important factor
underlying the reduced levels of the saving rate in recent years.
Nevertheless, the joint effect of stepped up investment in physical
assets and increases in their relative prices was sizable enough that
total net worth of households in real terms continued to follow a long-
term uptrend (see chart on page III-A-6, lower panel). Moreover, during
the 1980 recession, financial and total net worth are estimated to have
held steady or edged up in real terms, in contrast to the pronounced
declines that were recorded in the previous two recessions. This atypical
pattern was related primarily to the unusually steep cutback in borrowing
during the second quarter, and also to rising stock market and home
prices.
The burden of household indebtedness--usually measured by the
ratio of debt repayments to income--was an element of many forecasts
made in the past two years of a consumption-oriented recession, and is a
factor underlying some forecasts of a weak recovery. High debt service
obligations relative to income, other things equal, would imply less
income available to support consumption in the future. Aside from some
technical limitations to such use of the repayments-to-income measure,
the recent behavior of the statistic indicates that consumers in the
aggregate apparently have pulled back from the positions reached in
the second half of last year (see chart on page III-A-7). For consumer
installment credit, the debt burden ratio averaged 16.7 percent in the
second quarter of 1980. That was midway between the peak of 18.0 percent

in the third quarter of 1979 and the previous cyclical low of 15.6 per-
cent in early 1975. When scheduled mortgage debt payments are included,
however, the ratio remains in an historically high range.
Among the direct measures of repayment problems, the proportion
of past due consumer loans of various types rose fairly sharply in this
year's second quarter, as typically occurs during a recession (see chart
on page III-A-9, upper panel). Personal bankruptcies (lower panel), have
climbed considerably above previous peaks, even after a drop in August.
Liberalization of federal bankruptcy law last October accounts for part
of the upsurge, however, and the number of cases that will likely be
filed this year--about 300,000--still appears small compared to the
approximately 40 million households with debt. Nevertheless, the trend
in bankruptcies has been cited by many creditors as a source of concern.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Exchange markets were generally quiet and the dollar has appre-
ciated somewhat on average since the last Greenbook. As indicated
by the top panel of the chart on the next page, the dollar's weighted-
average value appreciated by 0.6 percent during this five-week interval.
Against the continental European currencies the dollar rose by amounts
ranging from 1-1/4 percent against the Swiss franc to 2-1/2 percent
against the German mark and Belgian franc. Net changes against the
pound sterling and Canadian dollar were small. Against the Japanese
yen, however, the dollar depreciated by 4-3/4 percent.
Gold fluctuated between the $660 and $710 levels during this
period, ending the interval around the $675 level, about unchanged
from the time of the last Greenbook.
Both economic and political factors played roles in exchange-
rate movements during the past five weeks. As indicated by the bottom
panel of the chart, dollar interest rates again rose steeply late
in September and, in fact, the U.S. three-month CD rate rose above
the weighted average of three-month foreign rates. The dollar's
rise against the German mark and other continental European currencies
was associated at least in part with the change in these market interest
rate differentials and with the increase in the U.S. discount rate
on September 26. Favorable U.S. producer and consumer price figures
released during the period also contributed to the dollar's firm
tenor.

Political developments also tended to favor the dollar's exchange
rate with some European currencies. Late last month the Cossiga govern-
ment resigned in Italy and the coalition government in Belgium resigned
in early October. Reports of increased political tension in Poland
may also have played a role. More generally, the outbreak in late
September of the war between Iraq and Iran -- and subsequent indications
that other Mid-East countries might be drawn into this conflict --
generated renewed fears about the security of oil supplies. After
the initial impact, however, the exchange-market influence of the
war tended to recede into the background, in part because of the
presently ample state of world oil stocks and reserves. Nonetheless,
the firmness of the pound sterling has been attributed in part to
concerns about oil and also to the recent $2/bbl increase in the price
of oil by Saudi Arabia at the mid-September OPEC meeting, and expec-
tations of further, albeit moderate, price increases ahead.
The Japanese yen came into recurrent strong demand during the
period and rose noticeably against the dollar and other currencies.
It dropped briefly after the outbreak of the Iraq-Iran war, but quickly
recovered and has risen to around the ¥ 206 level presently. Demand
for the yen has been attributed mainly, but not exclusively, to Mid-
East interests seeking attractive long-term investment outlets.
Japanese companies have reported good profits in recent months, and
Tokyo stock market prices have been bid up to record levels. In
addition, there is a widespread perception that fundamental aspects
of the Japanese economy have been improving; recent trade figures

IV-4
have been favorable and recent price figures have shown a clear improve-
in Japanese inflation performance.
.During the past few weeks the Belgian franc has tended to be
at the bottom of the EMS' narrow currency spread, with the French
franc and Dutch guilder taking turns at the top of the arrangement.
The Italian lira, which is permitted wider fluctuations than other
EMS currencies, is about 4 percent below its central rate with the
French franc.
Desk operations during this period included purchases of $532
million equivalent of German marks, $30 million equivalent of Swiss
francs, and $23 million equivalent of French francs.
, $279 million
equivalent were the System's share, and these were used largely to
pay most of the remaining swap debt with the Bundesbank. This debt
has now been reduced to $84 million equivalent, and taking balances
into account, the System now has moved into a long position in marks.
The Treasury's share of $253 million equivalent included purchases
of $37 million equivalent made in the forward market for three- and
six-months maturity. These were the first outright forward purchases

IV-5
made by U.S. authorities since early 1971. The Swiss franc acquisitions
were for System account and were added to balances. The French franc
acquisitions were likewise for System account and were used principally
to make payments on swap debt with the Bank of France, which has now
been reduced to $86 million equivalent.

IV-6
Foreign lending by U.S. banks. Total outstanding claims on for-
eigners held by head offices and foreign branches of U.S.-chartered
banks increased by $23 billion in the first half of 1980. (See table.)
At an annual rate this was substantially greater than the $37-1/2 billion
increase in the full year 1979, especially since foreign lending seems to
be seasonally weak in the first half. Most of the larger rise so far
this year has been concentrated in the lending to the G-10 countries and
Switzerland. A large part of the increased lending to the G-10 countries
and Switzerland consisted of placements with other banks in those coun-
tries, which in turn reflected, at least in part, stronger loan demand by
nonbank borrowers within that area.
Claims on the smaller developed countries (mostly in Southern
Europe and Scandinavia) also have increased at a faster rate this year.
However, claims on the OPEC countries have declined, presumably as a con-
sequence of those countries' larger current-account surpluses. There has
been a slight decline this year in claims on Eastern Europe; over the
past 18 months these claims have been unchanged as net repayments by the
Soviet Union have matched lending to the rest of the area.
Claims on the non-OPEC developing countries rose more in the first
half of 1980 than in the first half of 1979, although at a somewhat
slower rate than in 1979 as a whole. There was exceptionally heavy
borrowing by some countries last year for reasons that appear to have
been transitory. For example, in 1979 there was abnormally large bor-
rowing by Argentina (where exchange rate and interest rate policies
induced residents to borrow abroad) and by the Philippines (where U.S.
banks' share of total new bank lending to that country picked up sharply).

This year U.S. banks have stepped up their lending to Mexico and
Korea. In the first half, claims on Mexico rose $1.4 billion, more than
the entire 1979 amount. Prior to mid-1979 there was a lengthy period
when U.S. bank claims on Mexico declined, partly because of decisions by
U.S. banks to reduce the share of Mexico in their total foreign claims
and partly because of actions by Mexico itself that (in part uninten-
tionally) lessened dependence on U.S. banks. But since mid-1979 U.S.
banks have again been participating actively in lending to Mexico.
Claims on Korea were up $1.5 billion in the first half of this year,
almost as much as in the full year 1979. This surge has been part of a
sharp increase in Korea's global bank borrowing to finance the large
increase in oil import costs. U.S. bank lending to Brazil slowed very
greatly as long ago as 1977-78, and has remained low.
The average maturity of U.S. bank lending to non-OPEC developing
countries appears to have shortened in the first half of 1980. This is
suggested by the fact that U.S. bank lending to these countries increased
in the first half of this year relative to a year earlier, while there
was a decline in syndicated medium-term Eurocurrency credits to these
countries. It is likely that a reduction in the U.S. banks' extensions
of syndicated medium-term credits was more than matched by an increase
in short-term credits or unsyndicated (hence unpublicized) medium-term
credits.

In July and August, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was
considerably smaller than in any two-month period during the past
several years. Averaging $8 billion at an annual rate, the July/August
deficit was about one-fourth the size of the second quarter deficit.
This sharp change was largely the result of a drop in the volume of
imports while the volume of exports remained relatively strong. See
the table below.

Most of the fall in imports occurred in oil. The volume of oil
imports which averaged 6.0 million barrels per day in July/August, was
nearly 20 per cent less than the second-quarter rate. U.S. oil con-
sumption began to decline in mid-1979 and continued to fall through
August of this year. U.S. oil stocks, while easing slightly (seasonally
adjusted) continued at very high levels through September. Oil import
prices, which averaged $31.55 per barrel in July/August, were only 2
per cent higher than in the second quarter; some of the $2 per barrel
retroactive Saudi Arabian increase should be reflected in the September
import data.
World spot prices for oil have risen about $3-4 per barrel since
the outbreak of fighting between Iraq and Iran, and have not reached
about the same level as official prices. Spot prices had fallen
steadily since January and were below official prices before the onset
of the war. Before the fighting there had been excess oil supply in
world markets and various countries had announced plans to cut pro-
duction 10 per cent. These proposed cutbacks now have been postponed
and some OPEC countries have indicated their intention to increase pro-
duction to make-up some of the shortfall due to the interruption of
Iran/Iraq exports (3.5 to 4.0 mb/d.)
Nonoil imports in July/August were little changed in value from
the second quarter rate, but the volume declined by 7 per cent in
response to weakened U.S. demand. Declines in volumes of industrial
supplies and consumer goods more than offset small increases in capital
goods and in automotive imports from Canada. The volume of automotive
imports from Europe and Japan in July/August was at about the same rate
as in the second quarter but there was an increase in value as prices rose.

IV -11
Agricultural exports increased in July/August, particularly
exports of soybeans and wheat. Prices have risen but most of the
increase was in volume.
The volume of nonagricultural exports in July/August held at
about the same strong rate as in the first and second quarters of this
year even though economic activity in major industrial economies
generally turned down beginning in the second quarter. The volume of
machinery exports grew steadily throughout the year and increased near-
ly 4 per cent in July/August from the second-quarter rate. There were
increased shipments of many types of machinery, particularly con-
struction, electrical and electronic, and business and scientific
equipment. Aircraft exports, while down somewhat in July/August, were
still relatively strong. The volume of consumer goods and most
industrial supplies exports continued at much the same rates as earlier
in the year. Steady increases in exports of coal, steel, aluminum,
and fertilizer were offset by small declines in other commodities. Only
gold and silver exports declined sharply in July/August from the very high
rates of late last year and early this year. Nonagricultural export
prices on average rose 3 per cent in July/August from the second
quarter level. Much of the July/August rise was from higher export
prices for machinery, aircraft and consumer goods; industrial supplies
export prices eased somewhat from the second quarter level.
The net outflow of funds through banks, underway since spring,
continued through September. As shown in the table on the next page,
the U.S. offices of domestically chartered banks have reversed their
net positions with their own branches by about $24 billion since March

on a daily average basis, adjusted for weekend reserve avoidance
activity. (The average adjustment for weekend reserve avoidance
activity remained almost $3 billion in September.)
The foreign branches have used this inflow from their U.S.
parent banks to fund an increase in claims on foreigners (about
9 per cent between the end of March and the end of August). Their
liabilities to foreigners fell slightly during this same period. Over
the first eight months of 1980 the liabilities to foreigners of U.S.
chartered banks (domestic offices and their foreign branches con-
solidated) increased only marginally.
Credit extended to U.S. residents by the foreign branches of
U.S. banks has fallen somewhat from the July peak (see the table
above.) This is probably a reflection of the change in relative
costs to borrowers of prime rate and Eurodollar loans.
Official capital flows in August show an inflow of about half
a billion dollars. Preliminary data for September, covering only
holdings at the FRBNY show little change. OPEC holdings increased by
over a billion dollars in August, bringing the total official OPEC
inflow in 1980 to over $9 billion. Partial data for September indicate
a further increase of about $750 million.

Foreign Economic Developments. Reflecting in part a weakening of
economic activity, inflation has continued to moderate in most major
foreign countries. The rate of increase of the CPI has declined sig-
nificantly in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom in the most recent
3-month period for which data are available. Consumer price infla-
tion also has moderated somewhat in France, and wholesale price infla-
tion decelerated in the summer in both France and Italy. In Canada and
most of the smaller economies, there have been no signs of any deceler-
ation in the rate of consumer price inflation, with several of these
countries experiencing small increases in inflation during the last few
months.
Economic activity in the six major foreign economies remains weak.
Real GNP fell in the second quarter in each of these countries except
Japan, while industrial production has been either flat or declining in
all of these countries through most of the summer. Among the small
economies, Norway is the main example of robust economic activity,
though most of this strength is confined to the oil-producing sector.
Despite the continued weakness of foreign economic activity, pol-
icies have not eased much, with the possible exception of Japan. Japanese
authorities appear to have eased monetary policy somewhat and are re-
ported to be considering further monetary and fiscal stimulus.
Large current-account deficits continue to be recorded by the non-
oil industrialized nations. The trade-account position in recent months
has improved somewhat in Japan and worsened in Italy and Germany.

Individual Country Notes. Consumer prices in Germany declined
slightly in September, after small monthly rates of increase in July
and August, In the first half of this year the average monthly in-
crease was 0.6 percent. While some of this marked slowdown of infla-
tion in the third quarter is due to seasonal factors, the seasonally-
adjusted CPI has also advanced at a slower rate. The pattern of easing
inflation is also evident in the movement of wholesale prices, which
fell by 1.0 percent in August, and producer prices, which remained un-
changed during the same month. The price index of German imports has
been declining since April, suggesting that the terms of trade, which
were an important factor in the previous acceleration in inflation, are
now contributing to its slowing.
After a sharp drop in economic activity in the second quarter,
activity appears to have remained nearly level. The rate of unemploy-
ment has continued its gradual rise through September, when it reached
4.0 percent (s.a.). The volume of manufacturing orders was flat through
July following its very sharp drop early in the year; it fell a further
2 percent (sa.) in August. Among the most strongly affected industries
are construction and automobiles. Recent survey information indicates
a continuation of subdued attitudes toward the present business climate
with just a hint of improving expectations for the coming six months'
period.
Germany's current account continues to move toward a record
deficit this year. In August, the trade account was in deficit for the
first time in fifteen years. The current account through August showed

IV -20
a deficit of $12.0 billion compared with a deficit of $3.5 billion in
the same period of last year and $5.8 billion for the whole year.
Between March and August, Central Bank Money expanded at an annual
rate of 1.7 percent; by August, OBM had increased 4-1/2 percent (s.a.ar.)
from the base of the Bundesbank's target in 1979-Q4 and is therefore
below the 5 to 8 percent target range. The Bundesbank's announced in-
tention to relax cautiously its policy has been implemented by increased
swaps and repurchase facilities and a reduction from 9-1/2 to 9 percent
of the Lombard rate as of September 19.
In the national elections that were held on October 5, the gov-
ernment coalition of Chancellor Schmidt's Social Democrats and the Free
Democrats was returned to office by a substantial margin. The opposi-
tion Christian Democrats' share declined to 43 percent of the vote, re-
sulting in a loss of 17 seats in parliament, mostly to the Free Demo-
crats. The cabinet will remain essentially unchanged.
In Japan, after substantial trade deficits earlier in the year,
indications of an improving trend in the external trade account have
become evident in recent months. In August, the trade balance (s.a.)
recorded a surplus of over $700 million, the largest such surplus in
over a year, reducing the cumulative 8-month deficit to slightly below
$2-1/2 billion, compared with a $4-1/2 billion trade surplus during the
same period last year. The slower pace of activity in Japan, less rapid
increases in foreign currency prices of imported materials (including
oil), and the short-run price effects of the recent appreciation of the
yen have all contributed to the turnabout. The prospects for trade

IV -21
surpluses in the coming months remain clouded, however, in view of
recent government steps to stimulate demand, the longer-run effects of
the yen's recent strength, and increased foreign pressures for export
restraint.
Latest data on both activity and price developments in Japan con-
firm the trends cited by Japanese authorities in their recent shift
toward more expansionary demand management. The industrial production
index (s.a.) fell almost 4 percent in August to its lowest level since
late 1979; shipments fell by a similar amount. Although other indica-
tors of labor-market conditions remained relatively stable, unemployment
increased noticeably in July. According to survey reports, the prospects
for corporate profits over the coming months are not favorable; signif-
icant declines from high levels achieved earlier this year are expected.
Although the Tokyo CPI registered a sharp upward movement in the mid-
September survey, much of that increase is attributed to seasonal
factors. On the whole, inflation in both wholesale and consumer prices
has continued the moderating trend reported previously -due in large
part to the recent increase in the value of the yen. The yen's recent
strength is attributable in large part to heavy capital inflows, partic-
ularly, extensive purchases by non-residents of Japanese stocks.
In recent weeks the government's policy stance appears to have
shifted even more toward an emphasis on recovery of demand. Following
the mid-August cut in the discount rate, the newly announced changes in
credit limits for large city banks in the fourth quarter have been widely
perceived as reflecting an easing of credit policy. However, the rate of

IV -22
growth of outstanding loans is expected to continue at about the same
6 percent rate observed throughout this year. The authorities are also
reported to be considering a supplementary budget of moderate size
(about ¥ 500 billion, or about $2-1/2 billion) for later in the year,
and speculation regarding an additional discount rate cut in the near
future is widespread.
In the United Kingdom, real GDP fell 6.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
second quarter of 1980, marking the second consecutive quarter in which
there has been a decline in real GDP. The intensity of the British
recession is also reflected in data on industrial production -- between
December 1979 and August 1980, industrial production has fallen 8.1 per-
cent (s.a.); and the decline in manufacturing production has been even
sharper -- some 10.2 percent. The U.K. unemployment rate, which stood
at 5.5 percent (s.a.) at the beginning of the year, was 7.4 percent
(1.8 million people) in September. Particularly large increases (0.4
percentage points) in the rate were recorded in both August and Septem-
ber. The downturn in British economic activity may be having an effect
on inflation. The monthly increases in the retail price index since
April have been less than 1 percent, and in August the rate of increase
in retail prices was only 0.2 percent. (Excluding seasonal foods, the
August increase was 0.4 percent). Wholesale prices show a similar de-
celeration. The U.K.'s trade and current accounts were strong in August,
with the trade account showing another surplus, albeit a smaller one
than that registered in July.

The U.K.'s monetary target is 7-11 percent growth in sterling M-3
(s.a.a.r.) between February 1980 and April 1981. Recent data call into
question the authorities' ability to achieve this target: between Feb-
ruary and August 1980, sterling M-3 increased some 25 percent (s.a.a.r.),
with most of the increase having been registered in July and August.
The reason for the bulge in sterling M-3 is the removal of the supple-
mentary-special deposits scheme (the "corset"), which had placed
quantitative limits on the growth of banks' interest-bearing liabilities.
Removal of the corset led to a shift of funds into interest-bearing bank
deposits, which, in turn, caused a jump in sterling M-3. Data on M-1,
which is not as subject to corset-induced distortions, indicate that it
has been growing relatively slowly in recent months -- 7.5 percent
(s.a.a.r.) between February and August 1980. The U.K. government will
be reassessing its monetary target this fall and will decide then whether
to change the target base or aim at essentially no monetary growth for
the remainder of the target period.
Recent data confirm the weakening of Italian economic activity
that began earlier this year. GDP fell by 3.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
second quarter after having risen at nearly an 8 percent rate in the
previous quarter. Industrial production fell in July and August by over
14 percent (not annual rate), about 6 percent below its second quarter
average. The sharpness of the drop, most of which took place in August,
may reflect a faulty seasonal adjustment. The continuing stagnation of
exports and a weakening of domestic demand account-for part of the drop
in activity.

Consumer price inflation has slowed since the beginning of this
year; in the six months ending in September the CPI rose about 8-1/2
percent, compared with an 11-1/2 percent increase in the previous 6-
month period. Inflation slowed markedly in the summer, due in part to
seasonal influences; however, it surged in September, again because of
seasonal factors, as well as increases in administered prices.
In July and August the trade deficit averaged over $3 billion
(s.a., imports c.i.f.), and the deficit for January-July was over $14
billion. Imports appeared to have surged in the latest 3 months,per-
haps in anticipation of a devaluation. Also, the balance of payments in
August recorded a $320 million deficit; in the previous two years Italy
averaged a surplus of $1.4 billion in the normally strong month of
August. In addition to the trade performance, a poor tourist season
and capital outflows -the latter also a reflection of expectations of
a devaluation -- figured in the August outcome.
The Italian government fell unexpectedly on September 27, and the
decree laws, which embodied the government's economic stabilization pack-
age, have lapsed. As a result, the administered-price and VAT increases,
as well as the increase in the fiscalization of social insurance charges,
are no longer in effect.
In France, real GDP declined by 1.2 percent Cs.a.a.r.) in the
second quarter after advancing at a 1.5 percent rate in the first quarter.
Opinion surveys and retail sales data suggest that activity in the third
quarter was roughly stagnant. Recent surveys indicate that very weak
growth is expected in the final quarter as well. In the second quarter

IV -25
household spending cutbacks accounted for the weakness, while private
business investment and government spending were sources of strength.
In August the trade deficit fell to $1 billion (s.a.) from $1.6
billion the previous month; the main source of the improvement was a
decline in non-energy imports. The cumulative trade deficit for the
first eight months of this year was nearly $10 billion compared with
close to $1 billion in the corresponding period in 1979.
After rising at an annual rate of more than 13 percent between
December and March, wholesale prices showed almost no change between
March and August. Retail prices showed less of an improvement; after
rising at an annual rate of 18 percent during the first quarter, retail
prices increased at a rate of about 13 percent between April and August.
In a draft budget, the French authorities introduced a 10 percent
investment tax credit applying on all investment for a period of five
years. In view of the 50 percent corporate tax rate in France and the
length of the period of the tax credit's application, this should
provide a considerable stimulus to investment; the revenue effects will
not be felt until 1982.
French authorities recently have indicated that they will probably
overshoot the 11 percent M2 growth target (Dec./Dec.) by one percent.
During the 12-month period ending in August, M2 rose by 11.2 percent.
The growth target for 1981 will be reduced to 10 percent.
There is some evidence in Canada that the sharp declines in real
economic activity, which were experienced throughout the first half of
1980, may have begun to moderate. Industrial production in July remained
virtually unchanged for the third consecutive month and retail sales

IV -26
in July (s.a.) rose 3.5 percent after rising 0.6 percent in June. The
CPI advanced at an annual rate of 10.3 percent from June to August, as
compared with 9.3 percent for the preceding three-month period.
The Canadian trade surplus rose to a record $863 million in Aug-
ust of this year from $39 million in July. The rise in the trade sur-
plus was primarily due to the weakness of domestic demand. The large
decline in import volume may also be due to a slowing of energy-related
investment.
Interest rates in Canada have followed U.S. rates upward with a
slight lag. The Bank rate, which stood at 11 percent on September 26,
rose to 11.8 percent on October 9.
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister MacEachen has announced
that the long-awaited FY1980 budget will be presented to the Parliament
in the middle of October. The budget is expected to include an increase
in the tax on natural gas exports and a reduction in transfer payments
from central to provincial governments. It is unclear when the
Parliament will be able to take action on the budget.
