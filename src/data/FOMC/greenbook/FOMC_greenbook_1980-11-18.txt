The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The rebound in economic activity continued in October, although
signs of weakness were emerging--especially in construction. Employment
rose further and there was another increase in industrial production.
But auto sales rose only fractionally, and retail sales of other goods
apparently declined in real terms. In the investment area, the down-
trend in capital spending moderated as capital goods shipments and
orders improved in September. Meanwhile, the upturn in housing activity
appears to have stalled, with sales of new houses down further in
September and residential building permits dropping in early October.
Overall, prices have increased more moderately than earlier in the year,
but underlying cost pressures remain intense.
Employment and Industrial Production
Employment strengthened in October, as recalls of workers on layoff
mounted. The establishment survey showed a rise of 260,000 on nonfarm
payrolls, and employment now stands 3/4 million above its July trough,
with about half of the recession loss having been recovered. Over the
past three months, the strength in employment growth has been relatively
large in durable manufacturing and construction where losses were
greatest earlier in the year. Since July, employment at durable goods
producers has increased; this gain, however, represents only one-fifth
of jobs lost in the hard goods industries in the preceding year. At
producers of nondurable goods, where cyclical losses were more moderate,
employment changed little for the fifth month. The manufacturing work-
week edged up 0.1 hour to 39.6 hours--0.6 hour above the July trough.

Contract construction jobs increased 40,000 further in October, and
employment in the private service producing sector rose 107,000. This
latter rise was larger than the average earlier in the year, but still
below that experienced in 1979. Trade employment rose just 25,000 in
October.
As measured by the household survey, employment declined 31,000
as employment gains among blue-collar workers almost offset losses among
white-collar and farm workers. The overall jobless rate, at 7.6 percent
in October, was virtually unchanged for the third month. The number of
unemployed males aged 24 to 54 fell, while other categories rose a bit.
Since July the number of unemployed on layoff has fallen about 1/4
million,but such recalls have been offset by an increase in unemployed
reentrants to the labor force.
The additional strength now posted for employment and hours worked
in conjunction with other data indicate that industrial production rose
around 1-1/2 percent in October. The increases in the industrial produc-
tion index in the preceding two months were significantly larger than
previously published, and the index now stands about 4 percent above its
July low. The recovery in production has been broadly based with
especially large gains in motor vehicles, construction supplies, and
related materials. Autos were assembled at a 6.7 million unit annual
rate in October, compared with the low of 5.8 million units in the
second quarter. Truck output also has risen substantially over the last
several months. Production of durable goods materials, particularly
raw steel, has advanced sharply since July. Even so, the level of total
materials production remains 7 percent below its peak about a year

earlier. Production of business equipment, which declined 3.6 percent last
spring and was essentially unchanged through September, increased in
October. Capacity utilization in manufacturing, which dropped from 87
percent to 75 percent between early 1979 and mid-1980, apparently exceeded
77 percent in October.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Increases in total hours worked in recent months have been reflected
in advances in nominal wage and salary disbursements averaging 11 percent
at an annual rate. Based on the most recent readings on employment and
earnings, this pace likely was maintained in October. In the third
quarter, disposable personal income, boosted also by the cost-of-living
adjustment to social security payments in July, rose at a 3.4 percent
annual rate in real terms. Despite this improvement, real disposable
income was essentially the same as two years earlier.
Retail sales in nominal terms were essentially unchanged in October,
following increases in each of the four preceding months. While some of
the recent weakness in sales growth reflects a decline at auto and
related stores, purchases excluding automotive and nonconsumer items
rose at only a 0.4 percent rate--about the same as experienced in
September. These sales in October were 0.9 percent above their third
quarter average in current dollars and probably down somewhat in real
terms. Outlays at the GAF grouping of stores in October were about
unchanged from their August level and 1.1 percent above the average in
the third quarter.
Total new car sales edged up to a 9 million unit annual rate in
October, slightly above the pace in the third quarter. Foreign models

continued to sell at about the 2-1/4 million unit annual rate that has
prevailed on balance since April. Domestic unit sales, at a 6.7 million
unit rate in October, were up only marginally from September but were
1-1/2 million units higher than the low last May. Early reports suggest
consumer interest in the Chrysler and Ford new models, but buyer resis-
tence to the higher prices of all autos apprently has retarded the
advance in sales. While recently announced price increases on some new
models may appear moderate, prices of the more popular fuel-efficient
cars are between 15 and 25 percent above a year earlier.
Residential Construction
The recovery in housing activity has apparently stalled. Private
housing starts advanced to a 1.5 million unit annual rate in September,
but confidential Census Bureau figures for early October suggest that
issuance of residential building permits declined sharply from the pre-
ceding month. These estimates indicate that the relative drop in single-
family permits was smaller than in multifamily permits, which in
September had included authorizations for a large number of subsidized
units. Sales of new houses, another indicator of housing activity,
dropped for a second month in September to a 554,000 unit annual rate--
nearly 15 percent below the high reached in July. The weakness in these
sales resulted in a small increase in the number of unsold new homes at
the end of the month. In contrast, sales of existing houses rose 12
percent in September and were nearly 50 percent above last spring's low.
Such purchases are frequently made by assumptions of existing loans or
through the use of other lower-cost financing techniques and may not have
been affected as quickly by the uptrend in mortgage commitment interest
rates that began last summer.

In the multifamily sector, market conditions for construction of
nonsubsidized rental units have shown some weakening. High and rising
costs of development--including construction credit usually supplied
at a mark-up above the bank prime rate--appear to be discouraging the
start of such structures. The average vacancy rate for units in multi-
family rental units rose to 6.4 percent in the second quarter, up nearly
one percentage point from its historical low in the first quarter of last
year. In addition, rents generally have continued to rise more slowly
than construction costs.
Business Fixed Investment
Business capital spending turned up in September, moderating some-
what the declining trend in such outlays. After a drop in August, ship-
ments of nondefense capital goods rose sharply in September. In
addition, September sales of heavy-weight trucks held near their advanced
August pace. However, nonresidential construction declined again in
September, with real outlays falling to a level 16 percent below the
high registered in January.
Capital spending commitments data provide a mixed picture for
activity in the coming months. New orders for nondefense capital goods
rose 6.4 percent in real terms in September, with the increases centered
in the machinery component; however, the level of such bookings remains
low as they had dropped 14.2 percent in August and were 11 percent
below the peak in the first quarter. In addition, the backlog of
unfilled orders for nondefense capital goods at the end of September
amounted to only 6.2 months of current dollar shipments, down signifi-
cantly from readings earlier in the year. The total value of new

construction contracts for commercial and industrial buildings and for
nonbuilding projects fell sharply in September, following a rise in
August that was accounted for by a substantial increase in awards for
nuclear power plants. The current dollar value of contracts for commer-
cial structures in September was little changed, after rising moderately
in the previous month; but contracts for industrial buildings fell
further and were at a level about one-third below the recent June peak.
Private surveys of business plant and equipment spending plans for
1981 provide contrasting indications of such outlays. The McGraw-Hill
early fall survey points to a nominal increase of 12 percent next year.
Respondents also expected capital goods prices to rise 10 percent, thus
implying a small rise in real spending from this year. This anticipated
rise was bolstered by a huge increase, 44 percent, in the petroleum
industry capital spending plans; excluding this category, the increase
in nominal outlays was only 8.3 percent. An indication of greater
weakness in these outlays is shown by the confidential Merrill-Lynch
survey, which suggests a 7 percent rise in nominal spending. Both of
these surveys have had only a fair record of predicting actual increases
in spending; in the 1970s the mean errors of these surveys, regardless
of sign, were about 3 percentage points.
Inventory Investment
Inventory investment remained moderate in September. The book
value of manufacturers' inventories increased at a $10-1/2 billion
annual rate. Although this rise was above those of recent months, it
continued well below rates experienced earlier in the year. Food stocks
accounted for all of the September increase. Indeed, excluding the food

sector, liquidations of inventories were widespread among manufacturers.
With a sizable advance in manufacturers' shipments in September, the
stock-sales ratio fell sharply.
In real terms manufacturers have reduced their stocks in each of
the four months since the high in April, and this drawdown appears to
have continued in September. Most of the liquidation since last spring
has been in nondurable goods, but sizable reductions also have occurred
at producers of fabricated metals and motor vehicles and parts. The
ratio of manufacturers' real stocks to shipments peaked in June at a
level only slightly below its March 1975 high; it has declined substan-
tially since then.
The book value of wholesale trade inventories rose at a $1 billion
annual rate in September, following a near record increase in August.
Sales in this sector rose appreciably and the wholesale trade stock-
sales ratio also declined sharply.
Government Sector
Final federal budget totals for fiscal year 1980 indicate that the
unified deficit was $59 billion, the second largest deficit on record
and more than double the $28 billion figure registered in the preceding
year. Outlays were $579 billion and receipts $520 billion. The Carter
Administration's latest official estimate of the deficit for fiscal
year 1981, with their proposed tax cut, was $36-1/2 billion. OMB
considers this estimate to be too low, however, in large part because
of higher rates of interest now expected over the period.
In the defense sector, spending for compensation also is expected
to be higher than previously anticipated because of pay increases and

II-19
military housing and living allowances that are larger than previously
budgeted. Excluding personnel and retirement costs, the present Adminis-
tration anticipates fiscal year 1981 defense expenditures to rise by
17-1/2 percent in current dollars, and by 7 percent in real terms. This
projected spending rise is presaged by the recent marked increase in
manufacturers' new orders for defense capital goods. Overall, such
orders (in current dollars) increased at a 13 percent annual rate during
the third quarter to a level nearly 50 percent above a year earlier.
Meanwhile, state and local government activity has continued to
weaken. Payroll employment increased 20,000 in October, following
essentially no growth in the third quarter. Employment in this sector
has risen only 1 percent over the past year, considerably less than the
2-1/2 percent average annual rise of recent years and the 4 percent
average of the early seventies. Construction outlays in real terms
increased 2 percent in September, but they still remained 20 percent
below the January peak. The sharp decrease in real construction
activity over 1980 has prolonged the downtrend in state and local
government capital investment evident since the mid-1960s. Although the
longer-run downtrend was induced primarily by demographic factors and
the completion of the interstate highway system, the recent decrease in
construction expenditures has been largely related to high interest
rates and a fall-off in federal grant support.
In the near term, state and local spending will likely continue to
be under considerable restraint. Federal support has been reduced and
the general stagnation in the economy has constrained own-source revenue
growth. Moreover, the sentiment for fiscal austerity has continued with
an additional five states passing fiscal limitation measures on November 4.

II-20
Wages, Costs, Profits, and Prices
Most measures of aggregate changes in wage rate have shown signs
of moderation in recent months, but the underlying trend of labor costs
remains high and continues to exert upward pressures on prices. The
annual rate of increase in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business
sector slowed to an 8-1/2 percent rate in the third quarter from the
10-3/4 percent pace over the first half of the year. Much of this
deceleration reflects a less rapid rise in the wage rates of production
workers--to an 8-3/4 percent rate in the third quarter from a 9-3/4 per-
cent rate over the first half of this year. In addition, the rate of
increase in nonwage benefits per hour worked also was smaller in the
third quarter, following a bulge in the first half. Despite the slow-
down, wages in the third quarter were still 9-1/2 percent higher than a
year earlier. The rise over the comparable period between 1978 and
1979 was about 8-1/2 percent.
Workers covered by key union settlements recently have received
wage-rate gains well above the overall average throughout the private
sector as a whole, and substantially larger than they received in 1979.
First-year increases in all major collective bargaining settlements
negotiated in the first nine months of 1980, which covered 3 million
workers, averaged 9-3/4 percent excluding potential increases under
cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) clauses. The comparable average first-
year increase in all of 1979 was 7-1/2 percent. In addition, some 3
million workers under major contracts received COLA increases averaging
about 6 percent (not at an annual rate) during the first nine months
of 1980.

With the turnaround in output in the third quarter, productivity
in the nonfarm business sector rose at a 2.6 percent annual rate, after
deteriorating substantially over the preceding six quarters. The upturn
in output per hour, coupled with a less rapid rise in hourly compensa-
tion, resulted in a sharp deceleration in unit labor costs for the quarter
to a 5-3/4 percent annual rate. Even so, unit labor costs stood 10-1/4
percent above their level one year earlier, and in manufacturing they
were nearly 15 percent higher.
Corporate profits in the third quarter apparently rebounded from
the depressed second quarter level, reflecting the rise in GNP and the
reduced rate of increase in unit labor costs. However, corporate profits
from current production, which exclude inventory profits and treat de-
preciation on a replacement cost basis, probably were still below the
first quarter figure of $175 billion and down about 10 percent from a
year earlier.
Labor cost pressures have underlain the high rate of inflation
this year, although developments in food, energy, and housing costs
have occasionally dominated monthly changes in aggregate price measures.
Producer prices of finished goods, which posted a small decline in
September, turned up again in October. The rate of advance in consumer
prices returned to the double-digit range in September after a small
increase over the preceding two months. Moreover, excluding food,
energy, and homeownership costs, prices at retail rose much more in
September than in any recent month.
Food prices at all levels of production have risen at a rapid rate
recently, primarily reflecting this past summer's fall-off in pork and

poultry production. Prices for foods in producer markets resumed their
climb in October following a small dip in the previous month. In
September, retail food prices rose 1.6 percent, boosted by a sharp
advance in prices of meats as well as fruits and vegetables. In
contrast, energy price increases remained moderate through October.
Mortgage interest costs declined much less rapidly in September
than in the two preceding months. By providing a smaller offset these
costs accounted for a large part of the overall acceleration in consumer
prices. Home purchase prices rose by more than 1 percent for the fifth
time in the last six months, and the CPI mortgage interest rate index
edged lower as closing rates on conventional mortgage loans declined
for the third month in a row. The mortgage rate index of the CPI
appears likely to turn up in October as a result of earlier rate in-
creases for both conventional and federally-insured mortgages.
The acceleration in consumer prices excluding the food, energy,
and homeownership categories amounted to a 14-1/2 percent annual rate
in September. Unusually large price increases were reported for used
cars and educational items. But, even aside from these items, prices
for most other goods and services rose rapidly. At the producer level,
the index for finished goods less food and energy increased markedly,
again in September and October, after no change in September. The swings
in this measure in September and October largely reflected movements in
car and truck prices. In October, motor vehicle prices advanced
dramatically, reversing the sharp decline in the previous month. In
addition, prices for semifinished materials other than food and energy
accelerated.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Growth in the narrow monetary aggregates slowed somewhat in October,
but remained quite strong. At the same time, the expansion of total time
and savings deposits in M-2 quickened and large CD issuance continued
robust. The associated demands for reserves exceeded the increment to
nonborrowed reserves supplied by the System over the intermeeting period.
As a result, discount window borrowing and the federal funds rate have
increased since mid-October, with the federal funds rate moving from
around 12-1/2 percent to about 15 percent recently.
In response to the firmer money market conditions, continued strong
growth of the aggregates, and further signs of intense inflationary pres-
sures, market interest rates advanced substantially over the intermeeting
period. Short-term rates have moved about 1-3/4 to 2-3/4 percentage points
higher, and bond yields have advanced 3/4 to 1-1/4 percentage points, with
municipal bond yields climbing above and corporate and Treasury bond yields
approaching the record levels registered earlier this year. Most major
banks have increased their prime rates 1-1/2 percentage points to 15-1/2
percent.
The prevailing high level of long-term interest rates along with
expectations of future rate declines have led to a spate of postponements
and cancellations of bond offerings by both corporations and municipalities.
Corporate bond offerings remained close to the relatively light pace of
September, but sales of equities picked up in October as stock prices rose
to record levels; a further runoff of nonfinancial commercial paper was
again more than offset by rapid growth of bank loans. In all, total funds
raised in financial markets by businesses proceeded at about the strong

pace of September. Municipal bond issuance slowed in October, especially
near the end of the month. The federal government has been an active bor-
rower in recent weeks, selling a relatively large amount of securities in
its recent mid-quarter refunding. In the household sector, rising inter-
est rates apparently have stalled the advance of home mortgage commitment
activity, and may have slowed the recent recovery in consumer installment
credit.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Growth in M-1A decelerated somewhat in October to a 9 percent annual
rate as a drop in demand deposit growth more than offset a marked increase
in the rate of currency expansion. M-1B growth slowed by a slightly greater
amount--to an 11-1/4 percent annual rate--reflecting a slower pace of inflows
to other checkable deposits. The divergence between M-1A and M-1B growth
rates continued to exceed greatly the 1/2 percentage point difference in the
longer-run growth ranges for those aggregates. Thus, while M-1A remained
within its range in October, M-1B rose further above the upper end of its
range, recording a 7-1/2 percent average annual growth rate from the fourth
quarter of 1979.
M-2 remained above the 9 percent upper bound of its longer-run growth
range in October. Growth in this aggregate increased slightly to a 9-1/4
percent annual rate, reflecting an acceleration in its nontransactions
component that more than offset the slowdown in M-1B. On a monthly average
basis, the decline of money market mutual fund assets moderated in October;
total assets actually increased in the last half of the month, as inflows
to general purpose and broker-dealer funds outweighed a continued runoff
of assets at institution-only funds. Growth in total savings and small

time deposits at banks and thrifts increased, since a considerable slowing
of inflows to savings accounts at thrift institutions was more than offset
by an acceleration in the growth of small time deposits at both commercial
banks and thrifts. At S&Ls the strength of small time deposit inflows
reflected a pickup in the money market certificate component--as net sales
turned positive after five consecutive months of decline--and another sub-
stantial increase in small saver certificates.
Commercial banks increased their managed liabilities in October by
$7.5 billion, the second consecutive monthly increase. Banks continued
to issue large-denomination CDs last month, although the rise in outstand-
ings was smaller than in September, and term RPs, which had contracted in
September, also increased. As a result, M-3 growth accelerated to an
11-1/2 percent annual rate last month, putting it at the upper end of its
longer-run range. Commercial banks reversed a six-month trend last
month by increasing their net borrowings from foreign affiliates by $2.2
billion as domestic CD rates rose faster than Eurodollar rates, reducing
the incentive to shift domestically raised funds abroad.
The increase in managed liabilities in October reflected another
large gain in bank credit. Total bank credit expanded at a 12-3/4 percent
annual rate, down a little from September. Despite an acceleration in
real estate lending and a pickup in security loans and loans to nonbank
financial institutions, total commercial bank loan growth moderated some-
what, as expansion in business and "all other" loans decelerated. A slow-
ing in acquisitions of Treasury securities about offset an increase in
net purchases of other securities, and growth in total investments was
little changed.

Business Finance
The volume of funds raised by businesses in October appears to have
remained close to the pace of recent months--well above the second quarter
when financing needs were met in part by reducing liquid assets, but below
the rate of 1979 and early 1980 when borrowing requirements were boosted
by inventory accumulation.
Business loans at commercial banks (excluding bankers acceptances)
expanded at a 25-1/2 percent annual rate in October, slightly slower than
in the previous month. Outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial firms
decreased a record $1.8 billion in October, extending the decline in such
indebtedness that began in August. The continuing rise in short-term
market interest rates relative to the costs of bank borrowing apparently
contributed to this development. The high level of rates and volatile
market environment have also induced both borrowers and lenders to favor
shorter-maturity paper. Risk premiums in this market have not widened
appreciably during the past several months.
The upward movement in corporate bond yields since the October FOMC
meeting--to within about 15 basis points of the historic highs recorded
in late March--contributed to the continued relatively small volume of-
fered in October and expected in November. Gross public offerings of
corporate bonds remained at around $2.3 billion last month, seasonally
adjusted, only about one-third the monthly average of May through July.
Most of the new public offerings by industrial corporations were convert-
ible bond issues, all of which carried ratings less than Aa.
Private placements of corporate bonds in October appear to have
continued at about the same pace as in the first three quarters of 1980.

Recent data for life insurance companies, the dominant purchasers of
privately placed corporate bonds, suggest that the industry's overall
cash flow has recovered somewhat from its unusually low level earlier
this year. However, life insurance companies appear to be reacting cau-
tiously to these improvements, perhaps because they fear that recent
rate increases will lead to a reemergence of cash flow pressures, and
new commitment activity remains well below that recorded in previous
years.
As interest rates rose, major stock price indexes declined 1 to 6
percent over the intermeeting period. The Canadian government's announce-
ment of a federal budget containing several features that cloud the
future earnings prospects of oil and natural gas companies also has severely
affected the share prices of both Canadian energy firms and U.S. energy com-
panies with large exposures in Canada. Prior to their recent declines,
stock prices generally had reached new historic highs in mid-October and
average price-earnings ratios were at their highest levels in two years.1
Encouraged by the decline in the cost of raising equity capital, espe-
cially relative to debt capital, gross offerings of common and preferred
stocks totaled almost $1.8 billion, seasonally adjusted, in October, one
of the largest amounts on record. Even before October, equity offerings
this year had been proceeding at a near record pace.

Net Treasury borrowing through marketable debt issues totaled $4.3

billion raised in regular bill auctions, and the remainder through the
auctions of notes and bonds. In its mid-quarter refunding auctions held
early this month, the Treasury raised an additional $3 billion through
sales of a conventional package of issues consisting of a 3-1/2-year note,
a 10-year note and a 30-year bond. Recent rate movements have accentuated
the downward slope of the yield curve for Treasury securities of 6-month
maturity or longer, implying expectations of future rate declines but not
in the very near term (see chart on page 111-12). The yield of 13.31 per-
cent on the 3-1/2-year notes sold as part of the refunding was substan-
tially below the coupon-equivalent yield on 6-month Treasury bills being
traded at that time. In its refunding announcement, the Treasury indicated
that it expected to borrow about $25 billion in the market this quarter,
ending with a cash balance of $15 billion. This suggests that on a sea-
sonally adjusted basis Treasury borrowing will continue in November and
December at about the $8.4 billion monthly pace of the third quarter.
An increasing volume of Treasury issues has been absorbed by inves-
tors submitting noncompetitive tenders. Such tenders have recently been
larger on average in both bill and coupon auctions than they were in March
when even higher yields were available, perhaps partly reflecting somewhat
less pressure on fund availability at smaller financial institutions cur-
rently than in March and April.1
Federally sponsored credit agencies are estimated to have borrowed
almost $5 billion in the month of October (seasonally adjusted, offerings
1. Nonweekly reporting banks increased their holdings of Treasury issues
by over $5 billion in the September-October period (seasonally adjusted);
this contrasts with a net decline of over $1 billion in March and April
combined.

basis). This exceeds the record level of borrowing set in March of this
year and compares with $1.6 billion in September. The sizable increase
reflects mainly larger borrowing by the housing credit agencies. The
Federal Home Loan Banks borrowed about $1.8 billion in October, with much
of this total used for advances. FNMA borrowed about $2.5 billion during
the past month, raising $1.8 billion of this amount through issuance of
discount notes. With net mortgage purchases of only $500 million, FNMA
increased its liquid asset holdings substantially, primarily to gain an
early start in refinancing an unusually large amount of discount notes
maturing in November.
In the tax-exempt market, long-term yields climbed sharply from
their mid-October levels to record highs in early November. The Bond
Buyer general obligation index increased 83 basis points during this
period to a record 9.64 percent. In contrast to the taxable market,
yields on tax-exempt notes remain well below those on bonds reflecting
the strong demand by institutional investors for shorter-maturity securi-
ties. Some of the serial issues offered during October were structured
to accommodate this shift in maturity preference, which made it easier
for those issues to proceed to market.
Although the sharp rise in municipal bond yields late in the month
contributed to a decline in gross offerings during October, the volume
of tax-exempt bond issuance was still a relatively strong $4.3 billion
(seasonally adjusted), down from an extremely high $5.7 billion in Sep-
tember. Housing revenue bonds accounted for a relatively small amount
of the total bonds issued in October, following the trend of the previous
two months. One possible factor contributing to the lower volume is the

Mortgage Markets
Interest rates in mortgage markets have risen further since the last
FOMC meeting. Costs of permanent mortgages, construction loans, and
warehousing loans all have increased. Field reports and trade sources
suggest that the higher costs for longer-term mortgage funds have caused
the demand for this type of credit to slacken noticeably in many localities
during recent weeks. Funding for used-home transactions, partly through
"creative financing" techniques such as purchase-money mortgages, assumed
loans, and land contracts, is said to have slipped less than credit approv-
als for new-home transactions--a pattern characteristic of earlier periods
of credit tightening.1
In the primary market for conventional home mortgages, the national
average rate on new commitments for 80 percent fixed-rate level-payment
loans has risen 30 basis points since the last FOMC meeting to slightly
above 14 percent in early November; several West Coast S&Ls have posted
rates of 15 percent or more. Further increases seem likely in average
interest rates on new commitments in the primary market, judging from the
recent higher yields in the secondary mortgage market. Not only are most
FHA/VA home loans subsequently sold through secondary market channels,
1. More than four-fifths of the real estate brokers recently sampled by
the National Association of Realtors reported that some of their customers
had relied on such creative financing techniques in purchasing homes
during the past 12 months. A third of the respondents indicated that
creative financing had accounted for half or more of their business.

III-16
but field reports suggest that more originators of conventional home
mortgages have been looking to the secondary market, mainly to yields in
FHLMC or FNMA commitment auctions, when posting their rates.
Market participants also indicate that many lenders have become
more cautious about committing themselves to make long-term mortgages
at fixed interest rates. Their caution is said to reflect greater uncer-
tainty about prospects not only for the volume and the cost of loanable
funds but also for mortgage prices in the secondary market. As a result,
many creditors are setting mortgage interest rates, discount points, or
both only at the time of loan closing rather than at time of loan commit-
ment, and some other originators guarantee a stated closing interest
rate only for committments scheduled to be taken down within a relatively
short period, such as 60 days. Moreover, field reports continue to indi-
cate that more lenders are offering mortgages on which interest rates are
periodically renegotiated. Initial interest rates on this relatively new
mortgage instrument have generally been running 50 to 100 basis points or
more below the cost of credit on fixed-rate level-payment mortgages.
The recently reported slackening in mortgage commitment activity may
have reversed the recovery in this market that had continued into Sep-
tember. In September, the net expansion in mortgage holdings at S&Ls was
$4.8 billion, seasonally adjusted, and outstanding commitments increased
by $1.4 billion to $28.0 billion; new commitments were unchanged from
August at $9.9 billion, more than three times the exceptionally low volume
earlier this year.

III-17
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at nearly a 6 percent
annual rate in September, continuing its recovery from the substantial
declines recorded during the second quarter. Combined with a small
decline in July and no change in August, installment credit expanded at
a 1 percent rate for the full third quarter, compared with a record 11-1/2
percent rate of decline during the previous quarter. Early reports, how-
ever, suggest a somewhat slower growth rate in October.
The rebound during September in credit outstanding was associated
with another sharp increase in credit extensions. Since reaching a low
annual rate of $248 billion in June, extensions have risen by one-third,
to a $328 billion rate in September. With the sharp advance, extensions
equalled 36 percent of retail sales in September; although up from as
low as 27 percent in June, this ratio is in line with its longer-run
upward trend.
The volume of extensions picked up in all major categories of
installment credit, but particularly for automobile loans. Auto credit
activity reflected the moderately improved new-car sales pace during
August and September, and also some easing of lending terms and qualify-
ing standards. Finance rates on new-car loans at finance companies fell
30 basis points on average during September, and 90 basis points since
June, despite the upturn in market rates generally.
All lender groups experienced net gains in their installment credit
holdings in September. For credit unions, the increase in outstandings

III-18
was their first since September 1979. From October 1979 through August
of this year, consumer credit held by credit unions had contracted 11
percent. During the same period, commercial bank holdings had fallen
5 percent, and finance company receivables had risen 15 percent.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The dollar has appreciated by about 3 percent on a weighted-
average basis since last month's Greenbook. As indicated by the chart
on the next page, the dollar appreciated by nearly 5 percent through
the first week in November, reflecting a substantial rise in U.S.
interest rates while foreign interest rates remained on average fairly
stable. The dollar then plunged nearly 2 percent on the following
Monday, which was partly attributed to a reassessment of the outlook
for U.S. interest rates. Principal factors cited as precipitating
the reassessment were indications that real U.S. activity was weaker
than had previously been thought and surprise that the Federal Reserve
did not act to confirm widespread expectations of a discount rate
increase soon after Election Day.
The dollar's strengthening during the last 4 weeks has been
most pronounced against the mark and other Continental European
currencies. As Eurodollar interest rates climbed after Election
Day to peaks of around 17-1/2 percent per annum on 1 to 3 month
deposits, the dollar rose above the 1.95 Deutschemark level. Sub-
sequently, it dropped back to the 1.90 range, for a net appreciation
since last month's Greenbook of about 4-1/2 percent against the mark
and other Continental currencies. Against the yen the dollar's appre-
ciation was a smaller 3 percent, partly held down by continued improve-
ment in Japan's trade balance and inflation statistics, and also
dampened by statements that the Japanese were considering legal changes
that would encourage the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority and other

foreign investors to substantially increase acquisitions of yen-
denominated securities. Against the Canadian dollar the U.S. dollar
appreciated by nearly 2 percent, as Canadian interest rates rose less
than U.S. interest rates. Against the pound the dollar first depre-
ciated to around $2.45 per pound in early November, reflecting a
tightening of U.K. money market conditions and continued indications
that British inflation is slowing. Subsequently the pound has fallen
back to where it stood four weeks ago, at around $2.40, as attention
has shifted toward the prospect that the minimum lending rate may
be cut when the British report later this month on their reassessment
of monetary growth targets and control procedures.
Pressures within the European Monetary System intensified con-
siderably during the last week in October. For much of the subsequent
period the Deutschemark and Belgian franc were together at their
intervention floors, while the French franc and Dutch guilder remained
at maximum permissible strength.
In actions
to ease the strains, the Dutch central bank cut its discount rate
by 1/2 percentage point effective October 21 and the Bank of France low-
ered its money-market intervention ceiling in two steps. The second step,
announced on November 7, was accompanied by the temporary imposition
of reserve requirements on nonresident deposits in France. Subse-
quently, the exchange rate between marks and French francs has moved
to within 2 percent of its EMS central rate, compared with the inter-
vention limit of 2-1/4 percent. The exchange rate between guilders

IV-4
and Belgian francs, however, remains near its intervention
limit.
The rise in U.S. interest rates contributed to a decline in the
price of gold, which has fallen about 9 percent since last month's
Greenbook to around $615 an ounce. Also contributing to the gold price
decline were customs reports that the Soviet Union moved more than
$500 million worth of gold into Switzerland during September for
possible sale in the near future.
Desk operations since last month's Greenbook have resulted in
net purchases of close to $2-1/2 billion equivalent of foreign
currencies, almost entirely marks. The System also made small French
franc acquisitions that were used to eliminate its swap debt with
the Bank of France. The System's mark balances now total nearly $1
billion equivalent, about equal to the Treasury's net debt position
in marks.

The reduction in the deficit was largely the result of a sharp
drop in the volume of oil imports. Averaging 6 million barrels per
day in the third quarter, the volume of oil imports fell 20 percent
from the second quarter rate and reached the lowest level since the

IV-6
second quarter of 1975. This reduction in oil imports reflects
primarily the decline in U.S. oil consumption that began in early
1979. U.S. oil stocks, while easing slightly (seasonally adjusted),
remained at very high levels through September. Average oil import
prices increased only 2 percent to $31.43 per barrel in the third
quarter, after rising 10 percent in the second quarter. Oil imports
arriving in the United States through September were shipped before
the outbreak of fighting between Iran and Iraq.
Spot market petroleum product prices have increased 10 percent
since the outbreak of Iran/Iraq war, and spot market crude prices have
increased almost 20 percent. Thus, the substantial downward pressure
on oil prices that existed prior to the war, and was reflected in
third-quarter U.S. import prices, has been reversed. As a consequence
oil import prices are likely to be higher in the current quarter and
in the first half of next year.
Nonoil imports in the third quarter were little changed in
value or volume from the second-quarter rate. Sizeable declines in
imports of industrial supplies (primarily in chemicals, steel, paper,
textiles, natural gas, and various nonferrous metals) were offset by
increases in food (alcoholic beverages and coffee) and in automotive
imports.
Agricultural exports increased sharply in the third quarter,
with volume and price increases each contributing roughly half of the

IV-7
rise. Sharp increases in market prices of corn, wheat and soybeans
in recent weeks will be reflected in higher prices for agricultural
exports in coming months. The most recent price rises reflect a
slight deterioration in the already poor outlook for feedgrain and
soybean production in the United States and a more serious deteriora-
tion in the outlook for wheat and coarse grain crops in the rest of
the world, notably Australia, Argentina and the U.S.S.R.
Unusually high soybean exports in the third quarter may be
related to Soviet purchases in Europe of soybean meal. The Soviets
have run up against port and rail constraints on imports in their
effort to make up for two poor crops in a row. Use of high protein
soybean meal instead of other grains will allow them to import more
protein content per ton through their limited facilities. The Soviets
have already purchased 8 million metric tons (MMmt) of U.S. grain
for delivery between October 1, 1980 and September 30, 1981, the
maximum allowed under the terms of the embargo and the U.S.-U.S.S.R.
Grain Agreement now in its last year.
The recently signed U.S.-Chinese Grain Agreement calls for
annual Chinese purchases of 6-9 MMmt of U.S. grain in each of the
next four calendar years. The agreement has little immediate impact
on the outlook for agricultural exports as Chinese purchases of grain
for delivery in 1981 had already exceeded 6 MMmt. The Chinese have
also signed long-term grain purchase agreements with several other
grain exporting countries.

IV-8
The value of nonagricultural exports in the third quarter was
about the same as in the second quartet, but the volume declined
somewhat. Most of the decline occurred in industrial supplies --
especially in shipments of gold and silver. Even though economic
activity in major industrial countries generally turned down beginning
in the second quarter, U.S. machinery exports continued to increase.
Aircraft exports also rose strongly.
The outflow of funds from banking offices in the United States
that began this spring continued through the end of the third quarter.
More than half of the third-quarter increase was accounted for by
advances to foreign banking offices (including own foreign offices).
There also was a sizeable increase in loans to developing countries,
particularly the Philippines and several countries in Latin America.
Partial data for October suggest, however, that the outflow of funds
through banking offices has diminished. As shown in Table 1, net
Eurodollar advances by U.S. offices of domestically-chartered banks
to their own foreign offices decreased between September and October
(adjusted for weekend reserve avoidance activity).1/ The average
adjustment for weekend reserve avoidance activity increased in October,
but towards the end of the month there seems to have been a sharp

outstanding, rather than differences of month-end outstandings.
Second, they do not include the activities of agencies and branches
of foreign banks in the United States.

decline in this activity following a letter sent in mid-October by
Reserve Bank presidents to large member banks requesting that they
not engage in weekend reserve avoidance.
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States increased
by $1.8 billion in September. Preliminary data for October, covering
only holdings at the FRBNY, indicate an additional inflow of about $1
billion. The October inflow reflects additional OPEC holdings, which
also increased by $2.1 billion in September. About half of the OPEC
inflow over the two months was accounted for by one country's purchases
of Treasury notes. Total reserves of G-10 countries in the United
States showed a decrease in September:
The United States also has intervened in support of the German
mark in recent months. U.S. purchases of German marks reached nearly
$2 billion in October, one of the largest monthly acquisitions of
marks. This intervention by U.S. authorities was sterilized, i.e.,
the effects of the intervention on bank reserves were offset by open
market operations, and thus had the same impact on private portfolios
as intervention by the Bundesbank. In either case an increase in
private holdings of dollar-denominated securities is matched by a
decrease in private holdings of German mark-denominated securities.

IV-11
Whereas Federal Reserve participation is financed by a sale of Trea-
sury securities from the system's portfolio, Treasury participation,
on the other hand, is most often financed by a sale of newly-offered
securities in the market.

Foreign Economic Developments. Inflation abroad has slowed mark-
edly during the third quarter, as several major countries have made
rapid improvement in that area. The United Kingdom, in particular, saw
the annualized rate of consumer price inflation decline from over 23
percent in the second quarter to 8.4 percent in the third quarter.
Similarly, inflation rates in Japan and Germany were more than halved
from the second to the third quarter. Among the major countries, only
France and Italy showed accelerated inflation. The weighted average
foreign rate of CPI inflation of G-10 countries and Switzerland declined
from an annual rate of 13.5 percent during the second quarter to 8.5
percent during the third quarter. Data for October indicate a further
slowing of inflation in Japan and a slight acceleration in Germany,
where the September rate, however, had been zero. While the improved
inflation picture is consistent with weak economic activity, especially
in the United Kingdom and Germany, currency appreciation was a major
additional factor in the U.K. and in Japan.
Economic activity abroad continued to be generally weak in the third
quarter. The July-August average of industrial production was below the
second-quarter level in all major foreign countries except France.
German industrial production through September has continued to decline
below the already sharply reduced level of the second quarter. In Japan,
there was a 3.7 percent rebound in industrial production in September,
following the exceptionally large 4.5 percent drop in August. Despite
this rebound, the third-quarter average remained below the second-quarter
level. Current-account developments point to reductions from high
deficit levels in Japan and Germany. Japan registered its first

monthly surplus since early last year in September, and the German
deficit was reduced. The U.K. monthly surplus widened in September,
which contributed to a $2.4 billion swing from deficit to surplus
between the second and third quarters of this year.
Individual Country Notes. Economic activity in Germany has
weakened further since the last Greenbook. Industrial production fell
by 2.5 percent in September and the data for August and July were re-
vised downward. This puts the third quarter 2.4 percent below the
second quarter, which in turn was 2.6 percent below the first quarter.
The volume of total orders fell again in August and in September, after
having remained fairly stable at the low level to which it had dropped
in April. The August decline was due to a very large drop in the volume
of orders from abroad, primarily for investment goods. The seasonally
adjusted rate of unemployment reached 4.2 percent in October, 0.7 per-
centage points above the end of 1979 rate. The consumer price index
rose by 0.3 percent in October, following no change in September. While
much of the sharpdeceleration in the third quarter (to a 2.8 percent
annual rate from 7.2 percent in the second quarter) was due to seasonal
factors, the seasonally adjusted rate also fell from 6.3 percent to 4.8
percent. The wholesale price index declined for the second consecutive
month in September. The cumulative current-account deficit so far this
year (through September) was DM 24.5 billion ($13.7 billion). The
monthly deficit (n.s.a.) has been declining from its peak in July and
seasonal factors in the service account are likely to reduce the monthly
deficits further in the fourth quarter. In view of the weakened

IV -18
activity conditions, pressure on the Bundesbank to lower its leading
interest rates has mounted. The Bundesbank has so far resisted these
pressures, pointing to the current-account deficit and the weak DM as
obstacles to an otherwise appropriate easing of monetary policy,
In the United Kingdom, as well, the weakness in economic activity
has continued into the third quarter; preliminary data indicate a decline
in real consumer spending of 0.6 percent (s.a.) in the quarter. In
September, the United Kingdom registered its fourth consecutive monthly
trade surplus, as import volume declined sharply -reflecting the slow-
down in domestic activity -- while export volume held steady. Rates
of price inflation have declined markedly in the last several months.
Between April and September of this year, consumer prices have risen at
an annual rate of only 8.7 percent; the figure for wholesale prices is
9.1 percent. Although the index of average earnings -- the most
commonly reported measure of labor compensation in the United Kingdom --
continues to show wage inflation rates of around 30 percent over a year
earlier, recent wage settlements indicate grounds for believing that
wages will decelerate sharply in the next twelve months. In particular,
the 8.2 percent increase agreed to by the engineering workers union,
which affects 2 million workers, is a significant step toward a decline
in wage inflation. It remains to be seen if this settlement will estab-
lish a pattern, particularly in the public sector and the nationalized
industries, where the pressures caused by the high exchange rate and
weak domestic demand are not as strong as they are in the private com-
petitive sector,where most of the engineering workers are employed.
At British Leyland, a threatened strike recently has been called off

IV -19
and it now appears that a settlement close to the company's original
6.8 percent offer will be accepted. Negotiations over the miners'
wage claim continue, with little apparent movement toward compromise on
either side.
The current-account position of Japan has changed rapidly in re-
cent months as the growth of imports has slowed in line with reduced
growth in the domestic economy. In September, the current account
registered the first monthly surplus ($430 million, s.a.) since early
1979. The cumulative deficit has been financed in part by
long-term capital inflows, which have been unusually heavy since July.
Net foreign purchases of Japanese stocks (largely by OPEC buyers) in
the third quarter apparently exceeded $2-1/2 billion, but slowed
markedly in October. In other recent capital-account developments, it
has been reported that in October the restrictions on Japanese syndicated
foreign-currency lending were eased further and the current guidelines
were expanded to an estimated $7-1/2 billion in FY1980, and the re-
sumption of syndicated yen lending was permitted.
The consumer price index in October declined slightly, as did the
September wholesale price index. This continued easing of price pressures
has allowed the authorities to take further steps to stimulate the
domestic economy. On November 5, the Bank of Japan announced another
cut in the discount rate -this time by one percentage point to 7.25
percent, together with a reduction in required reserve ratios.
The industrial production index in September rebounded from its
sharp drop in August, but the average for the third quarter was still
almost 2-1/2 percent below its level in the previous three months.

IV -20
Exports and private expenditure, the two sectors which have supported
the economy during the recent downturn, still appear to be relatively
strong -- despite some recent pressures in foreign markets to reduce
export sales from the extremely high levels seen earlier this year.
In Canada, in contrast to the countries discussed above, there
are indications that the decline in real growth in evidence during the
first half of this year may not have continued during the third quarter.
Industrial production, after having fallen from April through June,
rose in July by 0.1 percent and in August by 0.8 percent. In addition,
the unemployment rate fell in September to 7.4 percent from 7.7 percent
in the previous month. CPI inflation continued its rapid pace in
September, rising 10.7 percent (a.r.) as the prices of meat and processed
foods rose sharply.
On October 28, the Trudeau government presented its fiscal year
1981 budget to parliament, which contains an energy program that will
lead to sharply higher energy prices, an increase in the federal govern-
ment's share of oil and gas revenues from 10 percent to 24 percent, and
a program that would lead by 1990 to at least 50 percent Canadian own-
ership of domestic oil and gas industries compared with the almost 30
percent which is currently held. No changes were proposed in personal
and corporate income taxes. However, an immediate C$.80 per barrel tax
was imposed on domestic oil, an 8 percent production tax on oil and gas
producers, and a tax on natural gas and gas liquids sold in Canada or
exported. Outside of new or increased expenditures to encourage energy
conservation, exploration, and a greater domestic ownership share of
the oil and gas industry,no major new government expenditure programs

IV -21
were proposed. The budget also included a pricing schedule for domestic
crude oil, which allows prices to rise C$ 4.50 per year for the next
three years from a current price of C$ 16.55 and a blended oil price
scheme where the price of domestically produced crude oil is averaged
with the price of imported oil to yield the final consumer price.
In Italy, consumer price increases have accelerated recently,
after having slowed in the spring and summer months. In October, the
CPI rose by 1.7 percent, after a 2.1 percent increase in September.
Administered price increases were the major element in September and
quarterly rent adjustments in October.
The recent weakness in economic activity, as measured by the sharp
decline in industrial production, is likely to persist througout the
remainder of the year, according to surveys of the business outlook.
Domestic orders are weak, and there is little expectation of a pick-up
in foreign demand. The trade deficit in September remained at about
$3 billion (imports c.i.f.), the level of the previous two months, and
the cumulative deficit for the first three quarters of 1980 equalled
$17-1/2 billion.
A new government has taken office, with Arnaldo Forlani as Prime
Minister, based on a coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists,
Social Democrats and Republicans. The government is expected to adopt
policy measures similar to those of the previous Cossiga II government,
and has already introduced some legislation incorporating parts of the
earlier package.
French industrial production in July and August combined was up
2.3 percent from the low levels of the previous two months but was 1.2

IV -22
percent below the first-quarter level and over 3.5 percent below the
high reached in the same two months last year. In September, surveys
among merchants indicated that a large majority of those questioned ex-
pected sales to fall. This nevertheless constituted a slight improve-
ment of expectations since the July survey.
The same survey indicated that four-fifths of the respondents
expect prices to continue their upward movement. In fact, retail prices
rose by over 13 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, while wholesale
prices showed only very slight upward movement in July and August.
The French trade balance for the first three quarters registered
a deficit over $11 billion, (s.a.) compared with a deficit of only $1.5
billion for the first three quarters of 1979. Nonetheless, the franc
remains strong in the EMS. On October 16th, in a National Assembly
budget debate, Prime Minister Barre once again reiterated his determina-
tion to maintain and, if necessary, defend the franc. French firms were
put on notice they would have to adjust to the franc and would not be
bailed out by devaluation.
Although the figures indicate that the French target (Dec.-Dec.)
M2 growth rate of 11 percent may be within reach, Finance Minister Monory
has indicated he expects some over-shooting. A 10 percent target has
been set for 1981, and most credit-control norms were further tightened.
Export and housing credit will be marginally liberalized. On November
7ththe Bank of France imposed a temporary 5 percent reserve requirement
on non-resident deposits, slightly raised reserve requirements on
domestic deposits, and lowered its money-market intervention rate to
10.75 from 11.25 percent.

IV -23
Inflation in the Benelux countries continued to be rapid through
the end of the third quarter. The consumer price index wasapproximate-
ly 7 percent above its year-earlier level for September in the Nether-
lands and for October in Belgium. The unemployment rate rose in each
of the two countries. This supports survey findings on business out-
look that the pace of real economic activity is slowing in these
countries. Because of the continued strength of the guilder within the
EMS, the Netherlands National Bank lowered its discount rate from 8.5
to 8.0 percent on October 21.
On October 27, the Danish government lowered its discount rate by
1 percent to 11 percent. Slightly improved prospects for the current
account and a lessening of the inflation rate were cited as the main
factors behind this decision. After averaging almost 2 percent per
month from September 1979 to March 1980, wholesale price increases have
slowed to an average monthly rate of about 0.4 percent from April to
August. Some slowdown in the rate of consumer price inflation is just
beginning to be seen.
In Sweden, the consumer price index jumped by almost 3 percent in
September due to higher value added and other excise taxes. In the 12
months ending in September, consumer prices have advanced by nearly 15
percent.
