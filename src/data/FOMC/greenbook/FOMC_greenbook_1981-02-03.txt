The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The economy ended 1980 on a note of strength. Real GNP is indi-
cated to have grown at a 5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter,
and December was marked by sizable gains in employment and output. Never-
theless, there was evidence of a moderation in activity in some sectors,
especially the auto industry. The pace of inflation continued unabated
in the final months of the year, as cost pressures remained intense and
energy prices reaccelerated.
Industrial Production and Employment
Industrial production increased by 1 percent in December--the
fifth substantial monthly gain in a row. As a result, industrial output
for the fourth quarter as a whole rose at about a 20 percent annual rate,
retracing most of the loss sustained earlier in the year.
The December increase in production, however, was smaller than in
previous months, in large part because of reduced automotive output
as well as slower advances in output of materials and supplies. Auto-
mobiles were assembled at a 6.3 million unit annual rate in December--
down 8 percent from November. Moreover, in the face of mounting inven-
tories relative to sales, scheduled domestic auto production for January
was cut markedly to a 5.1 million unit annual rate. Materials production
in December increased at its slowest pace since last July, and growth in
output of construction supplies was much reduced at year-end. However,
substantive gains were registered in the defense, space, and business
equipment industries.
Output gains continued to be translated into increased demand for
labor, as both employment and work schedules rose at year-end. Nonfarm

business establishments reported an increase of more than 200,000 in pay-
roll employment in December--the fifth consecutive month of large gains.
Employment in the service-producing sector continued to expand despite a
dip in retail trade employment, and construction firms continued to add to
payrolls in December. Manufacturing employment growth slowed somewhat
in December, but the average factory workweek lengthened by 0.3 hour,
bringing the series back to its pre-recession level of 40.2 hours. Between
July and year-end, manufacturing employment rebounded by one-half million--
about the same as during the first five months of the 1975 recovery.
The unemployment rate was 7.4 percent in December--little changed
from the level that has prevailed since May. Employment in December as
measured by the household survey edged down from its level of the prior
month; this compares with the considerable gain registered in the pay-
roll survey. Although the two surveys provided consistent readings on
the sharp contraction in employment during the first half of the year,
the subsequent recovery in household employment has been significantly
smaller than the rebound in payroll jobs. One possible reason that the
payroll employment series has risen more rapidly is that it registers
second jobs as employment gains, while the household survey counts a
worker as employed only once. However, even after accounting for
technical differences between the two measures, the current discrepancy
is abnormally large.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Continued increases in payroll employment, longer work schedules,
and wage increases raised personal income up at a 11-1/4 percent annual
rate in December--somewhat less than gains in the previous three months.

For the quarter as a whole, however, total personal income growth
accelerated to almost a 15 percent annual rate. Real disposable
personal income also increased--at a 3 percent annual rate--in the
fourth quarter of 1980. Although the recent gains in real income more
than offset the losses earlier in the year, the 0.9 percent rise over
the four quarters of 1980 still was less than half the advance over the
preceding year.
Consumer spending advanced fairly briskly in the fourth quarter,
but most of the strength occurred early in the period. Retail sales--
which rose 2-1/2 percent for the quarter--fell 1.3 percent in December.
The December decline was concentrated at automotive outlets (which
include used car dealers and auto supply stores, as well as new car
dealerships). Excluding automotive and nonconsumption items, nominal
retail sales were unchanged from November. Many stores reported parti-
cularly strong sales for the last week of the Christmas season, but this
surge apparently only helped to balance a weak performance experienced
earlier in the month. For the entire month, spending at general mer-
chandise stores declined, causing purchases in the entire GAF grouping
to edge down after rising appreciably in the preceding two months.
Total auto sales remained at a 9.0 million unit annual rate in
December 1980, about the same sluggish selling pace as in the preceding
five months. Sales of domestic models slipped to a 6.4 million unit
annual rate, notwithstanding credit rebate programs at Ford and Chrysler.
At General Motors, where there were no special incentives, sales perfor-
mance was noticeably weaker. Moreover, data for the first 20 days of
January 1981 suggest little improvement in sales of domestic models.

II-8
In contrast to domestic units, sales of imported cars rose in December
to a 2.6 million unit annual rate--the highest level since July and
nearly a 29 percent share of the market. The relative strength in
imported automobile sales probably resulted from normal lags experienced
by American manufacturers in establishing a market share for their new
small models, the continuing perception by consumers of superior quality
for many foreign units, and price advantages favoring imports for many
comparable models.
The general weakness in overall automobile sales in part reflects
increased ownership costs resulting from both higher prices and interest
rates. A year-over-year comparison of manufacturers' list prices for
four popular models and average financing costs suggests that typical
monthly payments may have been as much as 25 percent higher in November.
More than 90 percent of this increase appears to be attributable to
higher prices. While the direct effect of higher interest rates on the
increased cost of automobile ownership apparently has been small, the
publicity given to higher interest rates could well have had a depressing
effect on the attitudes of potential buyers.
Indeed, survey readings of consumer confidence in December 1980
indicated a sharp reversal of the steady improvement that had been under-
way since May. Both the Conference Board and the University of Michigan
indexes of consumer sentiment plunged in December, as households' outlook
for both the near-term and future conditions deteriorated. In parti-
cular, consumers indicated that they expected their own financial situa-
tion to worsen, apparently as a result of their expectations of higher
interest rates and inflation. Opinions about the housing market and

buying conditions for durable goods also were noticeably less favorable
in December.
Residential Construction
Residential construction outlays advanced markedly in the final
quarter of 1980, reflecting the particularly sharp rebound in housing
starts during the summer and early fall. Despite worsening financial
conditions, the strength in new housing activity continued in December
as total private housing starts remained at about a 1-1/2 million unit
annual rate for the fourth consecutive month. Single-family starts fell
6 percent in December, but this decline was offset by a 9 percent increase
in the multifamily sector. Some signs of weakness emerged, however, as
newly-issued permits for residential construction fell 9 percent in
December.
Real estate activity has held up surprisingly well compared with
the precipitous declines that occurred last spring, when mortgage
interest rates first pierced 14 percent. The use of a variety of alter-
native financing techniques may help to explain the relatively robust
pace of home sales through November. Although sales of existing homes
declined 8-1/2 percent in that month, volume remained stronger than
during the preceding summer, when the cost of credit on fixed-rate loans
was more favorable. Moreover, new-home sales increased 6 percent in
November, arresting a three-month slide. Prices of homes sold in
November rose sharply, in part reflecting the continuing tendency for
many creative home financing arrangements to result in higher sales
prices than would otherwise be the case. The average sales price of new
homes sold in November 1980 ($83,000) was 12 percent above a year earlier--

the largest year-over-year increase since the same month in 1979. Like-
wise, the average sales price of existing homes sold rose to a level 16
percent above a year earlier.
Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment decreased at a 3 percent annual rate in
real terms in the fourth quarter. Gains in energy-related investment
and in spending for some machinery categories were more than offset by
declines elsewhere. Purchases of heavy-weight trucks--which had dropped
sharply in early autumn--remained depressed in December, and real spending
on nonresidential construction fell back in November to a level 15 percent
below its recent peak reached in January 1980.
While some leading indicators of capital spending have picked up
recently, a sustained improvement in outlays does not seem imminent.
Over the fourth quarter, new orders for nondefense capital goods increased
4 percent; however, these orders are still below their recent cyclical
peak, and the backlog of unfilled orders has been on a downward trend
since mid-1980. Moreover, the extended period of weakness in the real
value of new contracts made between April and October for nonresidential
construction projects probably will dominate spending during the coming
months, despite a surge in new contracts in November.
Respondents to the Commerce Department's plant and equipment
survey taken in November and December reported plans for a 10.8 percent
increase in nominal outlays in 1981. This survey shows slightly less
growth than suggested by the earlier McGraw-Hill report, possibly
reflecting the sharp increase in interest rates between the two readings.
After adjusting for respondents' price expectations, the Commerce

Department's survey implies that real business fixed investment will be
about unchanged from 1980. The largest increases in spending plans were
reported by manufacturers--particularly in the machinery, petroleum, and
aircraft industries. Also, firms in the electric utility industry plan
to add to spending in 1981 after cutting back in 1980.
Inventory Investment
Businesses continued to maintain relatively tight control over
inventories during the fall. The total book value of manufacturing and
trade stocks rose at about a $20 billion annual rate in both October
and November, down from the $30 billion pace recorded in both the second
and third quarters. The moderate November accumulation primarily reflects
a small liquidation by retailers. In contrast, the book value of manu-
facturers' inventories increased at a $14-1/2 billion annual rate--the
largest increase since April. The factory inventory accumulation was
largely concentrated in the durable goods sector. By stage of fabrica-
tion, most of the accumulation was in work in process. Production and
sales figures suggest that additional accumulation probably occurred in
December, at least at manufacturers.
The November gain in total manufacturing and trade inventories was
accompanied by a 1 percent rise in shipments and sales. As a result,
the stock-sales ratio for all manufacturing and trade edged down slightly
to 1.39, continuing the decline that began last June.
The Government Sector
The federal budget deficit is estimated to have narrowed by $4
billion in the final quarter of -1980 to an annual rate of around $70
billion (NIA basis), as strong income growth and windfall profits tax

receipts boosted total revenues. In the fourth quarter the federal tax
burden rose to 20.8 percent of GNP--its highest level since early 1969
during the Vietnam era. A further increase in the tax burden occurred
on January 1, 1981, in the form of a scheduled hike in social security
payroll taxes.
In the state and local sector, employment increased only marginally
in December. Payroll growth during 1980 at this level of government was
at its lowest rate in three decades. Preliminary data indicate that state
employment actually decreased in 1980; this was the first such annual
decline since record keeping began in 1955. State and local construction
expenditures resumed their downtrend in November, after small increases
in September and October. In real terms, state and local construction
outlays decreased 5-1/2 percent in November to a level 8 percent below
a year earlier.
Wages and Prices
Wage and price pressures remained substantial throughout 1980,
despite the considerable slack in labor and product markets that developed
during the year. Although the average hourly earnings index rose at only
a 4.2 percent annual rate in December, this followed two months of
exceptionally large increases. Over 1980 as a whole, wages rose 9-1/2
percent--l-1/2 percentage points more than in 1979. Major collective
bargaining agreements exhibited a similar speedup. Much of the accelera-
tion in the earnings index occurred in the manufacturing sector, where
formal cost-of-living adjustments are prevalent. But larger wage
increases in 1980 also were reported for all other major industry

groupings. In particular, in the heavily unionized construction industry,
where COLA coverage is relatively uncommon, negotiated wage increases
accelerated sharply--from 8-3/4 percent in 1979 to 13-1/2 percent in
1980. In the less unionized trade and service sectors, hourly earnings
accelerated about 1 to 1-1/2 percentage points during the year.
Aggregate price measures provided little sign of a lasting slow-
down in inflation in the closing months of 1980. At year-end, a renewed
upsurge in energy prices was beginning to work its way through the economy,
and underlying cost pressures still were evident in the food sector.
Moreover, rising mortgage costs continued to push up the CPI. As a
result, consumer prices in the final two months of 1980 still were
increasing at more than a 12 percent annual rate. Even excluding energy,
food, and homeownership costs, inflation remained intense--at a 9 percent
rate during November and December.
OPEC price increases--as well as higher domestic crude oil prices
resulting from continuing decontrol--caused energy costs to reaccelerate
at year-end. At the producer level, energy prices in December increased
sharply for the second consecutive month; retail energy prices also began
to reflect these new pressures in December. Moreover, recent announce-
ments of additional price hikes for gasoline and fuel oil at the refinery
level should show up in coming months. Large inventories of crude oil
and distillates helped restrain price increases through most of 1980,
but these stocks have declined in recent months, raising the likelihood
of a further upward movement in energy prices.

II-20
Producer food prices declined at all stages of processing in
December, following a relatively moderate increase over the previous
three months. However, these developments have not yet been reflected
in retail food prices, which increased at about a 13 percent annual
rate in November and December. Moreover, the declines that have occurred
in producer markets appear to be temporary. Although livestock prices
declined at year end, high feeding costs are quite likely to push meat
prices up during 1981. In addition, as of mid-January, prices of some
fruits and vegetables were rising rapidly in the wake of severe winter
weather in Florida. Following a similar freeze in early 1977, the CPI
for fruits and vegetables surged 11 percent over a three-month period
before stabilizing.
For 1980 as a whole, price increases were substantial. Consumer
prices rose almost 12-1/2 percent during the year ending in December,
and producer prices for finished goods rose 11-3/4 percent. Both
measures had risen somewhat faster in 1979 when energy price increases
were even larger. However, the prices of goods and services that are
significantly influenced by labor costs accelerated in 1980. Consumer
prices for goods excluding food, energy, and used cars rose more than
8 percent over 1980 versus 6.6 percent during 1979. Likewise, the
price of services other than energy and homeownership costs accelerated
to 10.3 percent over 1980 from 8.8 percent during the previous year.
Producer finished goods prices of nonfood nonenergy items also accelerated
last year, particularly for capital equipment.

EXCHANGE MARKET CONDITIONS
During the two-day supplementary period pessimism deepened over the
outlook for the European economies, especially Germany. At the same time the recent
remarks by Volcker and members of the Reagan Administration about their plans to
strengthen the U.S. economy continued to have a favorable impression in the markets.
In this atmosphere, the dollar surged on heavy commercial and professional demand,
especially out of Europe. U.S. corporate treasurers, having been more cautious
in recent days, also began scrambling to cover their exposures. These various
demands swept the dollar 2 1/2 to 2 5/8 percent higher against the continental
currencies by Friday's close. Also, sterling and the Japanese yen, which had
previously managed to hold up well against the surging dollar, began losing ground,
falling 2 percent and 3/4 percent respectively on balance.
With trading frequently onesided, the Desk bought $240.4 million equivalent
of marks, including $80 million equivalent through the Bundesbank in Frankfurt.
These purchases were split evenly between the System and the Treasury and added to
their respective balances. In addition, the Desk bought $20 million equivalent
of Swiss francs split evenly between the System and Treasury. Foreign central
bank dollar sales came to $522.5 million, including $109.5 million by the Bundesbank.
Within the EMS the mark and the Belgian franc both dropped to their
lower intervention limits against the French franc. Also the Italian lira fell
below LIT 1000 for the first time, while remaining 3 1/2 to 4 percent below the
French franc. The evident strains within the EMS, especially on Thursday generated
rumors of a possible EMS decision this weekend to widen the joint float limits.
As a result the EC central banks had to purchase $423.1 million equivalent of marks
and Belgian francs all against French francs to support those limits.

Effects of the new benchmark revisions
The new benchmark revisions had only minor effects on GNP totals
for the 1960's; the level in 1967 was revised up less than 1/2 percent.
The magnitude of the revisions (in percentage terms) generally increased
throughout the 1970's. Consequently, as shown in table 1, the level of
current-dollar GNP in 1979 is $45.1 billion (1.9 percent) higher than
previously indicated. Substantial revisions to the level of GNP are
confined to a few components of the product flows.
The largest change was in business fixed investment (BFI)--up
$24.8 billion (9.7 percent) in 1979 from the previous estimate. As a
result of the revision, the share of nominal GNP devoted to BFI in 1979
now is 11.6 percent, rather than the 10.8 percent previously indicated.
Nearly all of the upward revision in BFI was in the non-motor vehicle
components of producers' durable equipment (table 2). Spending on items
in this grouping--which is largely composed of machinery--is now estimated
to have been $24.0 billion (19.6 percent) higher in 1979 than earlier
thought. This substantial increase is primarily the result of the above-
mentioned change in the procedure used to calculate spending on producers'
durable equipment.1 Prior to the benchmark revision it appeared that
equipment spending was becoming weighted towards outlays for motor vehicles
at the expense of machinery investment. As a result of the revisions,
however, the share of equipment spending devoted to motor vehicles during
the 1975-79 expansion now is indicated to have averaged about 20 percent-
roughly the same as during the 1971-73 expansion and down from the initial
estimate of 24 percent (table 3).
The other major contribution to the upward revision in GNP was in the
international sector, primarily reflecting the addition to GNP of reinvested
earnings of incorporated foreign affiliates. Net exports of goods and ser-
vices were revised up $18.0 billion in 1979, with $15.1 billion accounted
for by the conceptual change.2 There were smaller revisions in the other
components of GNP, primarily as a result of the incorporation of new source
data.
On the income side of the accounts, the largest revisions were to
corporate profits (table 4), which were revised upward throughout the
period. Virtually all of the revision was in profits before taxes and
also was due in large part to the addition of reinvested foreign earnings
to the NIPA. There also was a large upward revision in net interest, up
$13.7 billion in 1979; this primarily reflects new procedures for estima-
ting the income earned by finance companies. As a result of the higher
1. It should be noted that data from the recent benchmark revision of
the plant and equipment survey suggest that a substantial upward boost to
the producers' durable equipment estimate also would have occurred under
the old procedures.
2. Other revisions to the foreign sector included the incorporation of
new source data, and new seasonal adjustment and deflation methods.

level of interest income as well as smaller revisions to other components,
personal income was raised substantially in recent years ($19.6 billion
in 1979). With estimates of personal outlays little changed by the
benchmarking, the saving rate was revised up about 1-1/4 percentage points
for the period since mid-1979. Consequently, the recent low for the sav-
ing rate now is shown to be 4.7 percent in 1979-Q4 rather than the 3.5
percent figure previously indicated.
The level of the implicit GNP deflator (table 3) was revised down
over the past several years, accumulating to a total of 1.7 percent in
1979. The revision in the deflator is due in large part to improved pro-
cedures for deflating net exports, new or revised source data for some
personal consumption expenditure components, and the use of more appro-
priate and detailed deflators for state and local government purchases.
Cyclical Fluctuations
The benchmark revisions did not significantly affect the contour
of postwar business cycles (table 5). Neither the timing nor duration of
postwar cycles was changed. Moreover, a comparison of old and new estimates
of the amplitude and severity/strength of recent cycles indicates only
small differences. The average annual rate of decline in real GNP during
the 1969-70 recession now is indicated to be 0.4 percentage point smaller,
while estimates for the 1973-75 recession show a rate of contraction 0.8
percentage point less severe, at an annual rate. Average real GNP growth
rates for the two expansions that occurred during the last decade were
revised up less than 1/4 percentage point, at an annual rate.
Revisions to recent growth
An interesting aspect of the NIPA revisions is the altered view
of real economic growth during the last four years. As shown in table 6,
there was a fractional revision to real GNP growth over the four quarters
of 1977 and larger upward revisions for 1978, 1979, and the first and
third quarters of 1980. Real GNP growth rates for 1978 and 1979 (table 6,
line 10) are about 3/4 percentage point higher; real GNP in 1980-Q1 is now
indicated to have risen at a 3.1 percent annual rate compared with the
previously published 1-1/4 percent rise.
For 1977, the growth of capital spending was revised up substantially,
but this was offset by slower household spending for consumption and
housing. In subsequent years a considerable portion of the faster growth
appears to be related to larger increases in net exports. As indicated
by the difference between the revised growth of GNP (line 1) and that of
gross domestic product (line 9) the methodological change incorporating
reinvested earnings of foreign affiliates not only raised the level but
also the rates of increase of real GNP in 1978, 1979, and the first quarter
of 1980. Net exports also were raised in the first and third quarters of
1980, primarily reflecting revised estimates of higher exports early in the
year and lower oil imports in the summer months.

In addition, growth of state and local government purchases was
raised sharply in 1979, apparently due to more complete data showing
higher construction outlays. Recently sluggishness in such outlays has
been a major source of weakness in overall activity, and despite the
1979 changes, the revisions to growth in state and local purchases for
1980 were only minor.
Implications for productivity
Despite the faster growth rate of real GNP in the last few years,
the growth rate of nonfarm business output over the last half of the
1970's (table 7) was revised up only fractionally.1 Consequently,
estimates of productivity growth for this period are likely to be little
changed. Measured between the 1973 and early 1980 business cycle peaks,
productivity growth initially was indicated to be .5 percent (annual rate);
based on the revised output figures, the growth rate of productivity over
this period has been boosted to .7 percent. However some of the produc-
tivity improvement indicated for 1979 may be lost after the July benchmark
revisions to the data on hours worked, which probably will show a faster
growth of labor input in 1979 than currently published.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The narrow monetary aggregates weakened markedly in December but
are estimated to have rebounded significantly in January, if adjustment
is made for transfers to NOW accounts. Movements in M-1A and M-1B have
been greatly distorted since year-end by an influx of funds to NOW accounts
that has considerably exceeded earlier projections. Most of the NOW
account growth evidently has represented shifts from demand deposits--
at least in the case of commercial banks. M-2, which increased only
slightly in December, appears to be growing rapidly in January reflect-
ing both the rapid expansion of its M-1B component and a sharp turnaround
in money market mutual fund share growth.
The general decline in market interest rates that began just prior
to the December FOMC meeting, partly in response to the slowing in the
growth of the monetary aggregates, continued through the first week of
January. Since then, with continued firmness in the federal funds market
and indications of strength in economic activity, most short-term interest
rates have increased about 3/4 to 1-1/2 percentage points. Treasury bill
rates are currently 1-1/4 to 2 percentage points below their December
highs, and short-term private rates generally remain more than 3 percen-
tage points lower. On balance, bond yields are 3/4 to 1-1/4 percentage
points below their December peaks, while primary mortgage market rates
are only slightly lower.
Total business borrowing has remained essentially unchanged in the
past month or so, but its composition has shifted to include less reliance
on bank credit and increased use of commercial paper and longer-term debt
instruments. In the government sector, Treasury borrowing dropped in

January following a large increase in December. State and local govern-
ment issuance of debt also declined in January as the volume of mortgage
revenue bonds fell off sharply. Mortgage lending strengthened in the
fourth quarter as a whole, but there were signs that the rise in interest
rates was slowing residential mortgage activity as the quarter progressed.
Consumer installment credit continued to expand, although at a slow pace.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The extension of NOW accounts nationwide has had a pronounced impact
on the growth of the narrow monetary aggregates in January. Interest-bear-
ing transactions deposits outstanding are estimated to have grown from $27
billion (month-average basis, not seasonally adjusted) in December to
$43 billion in January, with commercial banks accounting for about $13
billion of the net increase and thrift institutions the remainder.1
Reflecting this surge in other checkable deposits, M-1A is estimated to
be contracting at a 28-3/4 percent annual rate in January, while M-1B is
estimated to be expanding at a 19-1/2 percent rate.
The marked decline in M-1A suggests that a large share of the
increase in other checkable deposits has represented shifting from demand
deposits. Although the extent of such transfers is uncertain, a Reserve
Bank survey indicated that, during the first two weeks of the year,
almost 90 percent of the increase in interest-bearing transactions accounts
at commercial banks were funds diverted from demand deposits, while the
remainder came from savings accounts and other liquid assets. With a lower
fraction of NOW inflows at thrift institutions believed to have come from
1. Net inflows into other checkable deposits for January are estimated
to have been $9.6 billion in the first week, $6.4 billion in the second
week, and $1.5 billion in the third week.

reduces the growth in M-1B to 10-1/2 percent after the December contrac-
tion of 9 percent.
M-2 growth has picked up in January to an estimated 10-1/2 percent
annual rate, after slowing sharply in December when the outflow of demand
deposits was accompanied by less rapid growth in the nontransactions com-
ponent. The acceleration in M-2 in January has been due largely to the
rebound in M-1B but in part also to the renewed growth of money market
mutual fund (MMMF) shares. In January MMMF shares are projected to have
increased by $4.6 billion (month-average basis, not seasonally adjusted),
after declining almost $5 billion from August to December (see chart on
page III-6).1 The weakness in money funds in the final months of 1980
occurred as the net return on these investment outlets lagged considerably
the rise in yields on other short-term instruments. However, when market
rates fell in December and early January, the yields on MMMFs continued
to rise and by late December finally surpassed rates for other short-term
instruments.
The resurgence of MMMF growth in January has been accompanied by a
slower expansion of the savings and small time component of M-2. The
1. Inflows to MMMFs averaged $2.4 billion per week during the first three
weeks of 1981. Money funds have shown considerable strength in the open-
ing months of other years, but the extent of the seasonal influence is not
yet quantifiable. In December flows to MMMFs also may have been reduced
by the record $1.3 billion (not seasonally adjusted) increase in short-term
unit investment funds during that month. As of January 20, these short-
term trusts had increased only another $350 million.

runoff in savings deposits is estimated to have stepped up in January, but
the incremental outflow is less than the estimated volume of shifts from
savings to other checkable deposits. Small time deposits have continued
to grow rapidly in January, but slower than in December. Data for a
sample of S&Ls indicate that the six-month money market certificate (MMC)
continued to be the major source of growth in small time deposits in early
January, as the cap on the 2-1/2 year small savers certificate (SSC) has
kept the yield on that instrument below comparable market rates.
The expansion of large-denomination time deposits at commercial
banks and thrift institutions is expected to slow in January from the
very brisk pace of December, but to remain substantial. Boosted by the
rapid acceleration in the M-2 component, however, M-3 growth in January
is estimated to have picked up to 14-1/2 percent. A continuing higher
level of short-term Eurodollar yields relative to domestic rates in
January likely induced a modest portion of the funds raised in January
through large CD issuance to be transferred by U.S. banks to foreign
branches or foreign head offices, as was the case in December.
In December, commercial bank credit expanded at about a 12-3/4 per-
cent annual rate, down from a 16-1/2 percent rate in November, as growth
in both loans and investments slowed. The deceleration in business loan
growth accounted for most of the weakening in loan expansion; real estate
lending strengthened some in December, and fragmentary data suggest that
consumer loans increased in December for the first time since last February.
Data from large banks for the first two weeks of January suggest continued
slowing in bank credit reflecting further weakness in business loans and
security loans.

Business Finance
The reduction in business borrowing at banks in December coincided
with increased issuance of commercial paper and some pickup in offerings
of longer-term debt securities. Business loans at commercial banks net of
bankers acceptances expanded at a 22-3/4 percent annual rate in December,
down from 26-3/4 percent in November. The slower growth in business
loans at commercial banks was partly offset by the $600 million increase
in nonfinancial commercial paper in December. Data for early January
indicate that nonfinancial commercial paper issuance strengthened further
and that bank loan expansion slowed as the spread of the prime over com-
mercial paper rates remained wider than in much of December.
Gross issuance of publicly offered bonds rose to about $2.2 bil-
lion in December, and, with the decline in interest rates from their Decem-
ber peaks, has increased further to $3.3 billion in January. Most of the
increase in December was attributable to an enlarged volume of bond offer-
ings by financial corporations and public utilities. In January, however,
industrial corporations have accounted for a large proportion of the esti-
mated pickup in bond issuance, and many of these issuers reportedly plan
to reduce short-term indebtedness with the proceeds.
Private placements of corporate bonds likely have continued at the
reduced pace of the last several quarters. Although the liquidity pres-
sures that life insurance companies experienced in early 1980 appear not
to have reemerged, the companies have remained cautious about making new
commitments. In addition, faced with uncertainty about future interest
rate fluctuations and the availability of funds, many life insurers
reportedly are planning to allocate a larger portion of their investment

portfolios to short-term liquid assets and easily marketable longer-term
securities.
Stock prices have varied widely over the intermeeting period, but
have declined in recent weeks. Most of the major stock indexes show a
small drop in prices since the last FOMC meeting. New offerings of com-
mon and preferred stock totaled about $1.5 billion in December, somewhat
below the record monthly average for 1980. In January, new equity offer-
ings have rebounded to about $2.1 billion.
Government Finance
In January, marketable borrowing by the Treasury is estimated at
about $8 billion (not seasonally adjusted), including $3.7 billion in
bills at the regular auctionsI and $4.2 billion in coupon issues,2 after
a sizable $14-1/2 billion in December. For the first quarter of 1981,
the Treasury is expected to borrow about $26 billion to finance a
deficit that could be as large as $34 billion. This would be about the
same as in the fourth quarter of last year, when the deficit of $35.6
billion was financed by $28 billion of borrowings and an $8.7 billion
reduction in the Treasury's cash balances. The federal debt ceiling
will have to be raised from the current $935 billion level soon after
February 15, if it is not to inhibit Treasury financing.
In recent months, foreign central banks have been important pur-
chasers of Treasury debt. Foreign official institutions added $7 bil-
lion to their holdings of Treasury securities at the New York Fed in the
1. The Treasury also raised $2.5 billion in cash management bills in
January that matured on January 22.
2. Of the coupon issues, $2.7 billion were 7-year notes and $1.5 billion
were 20-year bonds. The 20-year bond is expected to replace the 15-year
bond cycle that the Treasury has followed since the third quarter of 1977.

fourth quarter (almost entirely bills) and another $2 billion, with about
half of this in bills, since the start of 1981.1 At Treasury bill auc-
tions, interest of small investors also has remained fairly strong with
noncompetitive awards averaging about $1.5 billion per auction over the
past month and a half. This amount is, however, somewhat less than the
average at auctions in October and November.
Federally sponsored agency borrowing is expected to decline sharply
in January to $1.5 billion (not seasonally adjusted) as the two major
housing credit agencies have reduced their demand for funds. Federal
Home Loan Banks have borrowed $300 million in January after tapping the
market for $1.9 billion in December. FNMA borrowings are expected to
total only $350 million in January, compared with $1.5 billion in Decem-
ber. Although seasonal factors accounted for much of the decline in
borrowing by these housing agencies, the fall also could reflect the
reduction in the lending activity by the agencies in response to some
easing in interest rates from December to January. At FNMA, the dropoff
in offerings at the most recent biweekly auction of standby commitments
also may have been related to the agency having increased commitment fees
and reduced the period over which commitment rates will be guaranteed.2
The gross volume of bonds issued by state and local governments in
January is estimated at about $2.8 billion, down from almost $4 billion
in the previous month. The smaller volume in the first month of this
year has been due to the sharp drop in housing revenue bonds. With the

approach of the January 1, 1981, date for implementation of the new restric-
tive federal legislation governing mortgage revenue bonds, offerings of
these securities jumped to $2.1 billion (not seasonally adjusted) in
December. In January mortgage revenue bonds have totaled only about $70
million, owing in part to the uncertainty of issuers regarding procedures
under the new rules.

The surge in issuance of mortgage revenue bonds in December appar-
ently put additional upward pressure on tax-exempt security yields. The
Bond Buyer index of rates on general obligation bonds rose to a record
10.56 percent by mid-December, about 110 basis points above the previous
all-time high reached in April 1980.1 As a result of these record rates,
the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields rose to 74 percent in December.
1. The Bond Buyer revenue bond index also reached a record 11.41 percent
in December.

III-15
Currently the Bond Buyer index of yields on general obligation bonds
stands at 9.68 percent and the tax-exempt/taxable yield ratio is about
67 percent.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage lending increased somewhat in the fourth quarter, despite
a rise in interest rates on conventional home loans. The national average
contract rate on new commitments for fixed-rate level payment conventional
loans at S&Ls peaked at 14.95 percent in December, and is currently 10
basis points lower. In part, the pickup in mortgage lending in the face
of rising rates reflected the usual lag in takedowns of commitments made
earlier. Also, field reports continue to indicate that home buyers have
been able to obtain some mortgage financing at yields below those pre-
vailing on standard unsubsidized long-term contracts. Mortgage loans
financed by tax-exempt mortgage bonds issued earlier by municipalities
reportedly have been available in some localities at contract rates
between 10 and 13 percent, while renegotiable-rate mortgages (RRMs),
which have been marketed aggressively in many areas, have carried initial
rates averaging 1/2 to 3/4 percentage point below yields on fixed-rate
loans. In addition, home sellers apparently continue to be an important
source of lower-cost financing in the market for existing houses.
The measured increase in net mortgage lending in the fourth quarter
primarily reflected loan growth at depository institutions. Commercial
banks increased their mortgage loans at a $29 billion seasonally adjusted
annual rate in the last three months of 1980, up considerably from the
$16 billion pace set in the third quarter. Savings and loan associations

again were the single largest source of mortgage financing in the fourth
quarter. Acquisitions of mortgages by federally related agencies also
picked up but remained rather modest.
Despite the strength in net mortgage extensions in the fourth
quarter, there were indications that the rise in mortgage interest rates
over the quarter damped residential mortgage activity as the quarter
progressed. New mortgage commitments at S&Ls generally declined after
September, and net mortgage acquisitions by these institutions peaked in
October. At the end of the quarter, outstanding mortgage loan commitments
at S&Ls were about 3 percent below their level three months earlier.
The desire of an increasing number of S&Ls to emphasize RRMs,
rather than fixed-rate long-term mortgages, reflects an attempt to
make returns on their asset portfolios more responsive to interest rate
movements. This also may have been a factor in the decision of S&Ls to
build up their liquid asset holdings. The move toward more interest-
sensitive assets has been motivated by the increasing proportion of
thrift deposits with market determined interest rates and relatively
short maturities--especially MMCs and large CDs (see chart on page 111-19).
However, the shift in assets has not been large enough to offset the
impact of high interest rates on thrift earnings. In the second half of
1980, it is estimated that the ratio of net income to average assets for
FSLIC-insured S&Ls fell to a record low 7 basis points (annualized),
while the same ratio for MSBs was -28 basis points--also an all-time
low. If interest rates remain at current levels, profitability of S&Ls
and MSBs could decline as much as another 50 basis points in the first
six months of 1981. This would be an unprecedented loss position for

this industry and it has raised concern among thrift officials regarding
insolvencies and reduced public confidence.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding continued to expand at
about a modest 3 percent rate in November, with net automobile loan
extensions increasing at a somewhat faster pace than in October and
revolving credit growth remaining essentially unchanged. Preliminary
estimates for commercial banks in December indicate that consumer borrow-
ing may have picked up moderately in that month, despite evidence that
some creditors further boosted consumer interest rates or otherwise
tightened lending terms.
The increase in consumer debt payment problems that surfaced early
in 1980 may have abated during the fourth quarter. The number of per-
sonal bankruptcies filed dropped sharply in November after soaring in
the first 10 months. Furthermore, some commercial banks surveyed infor-
mally in mid-January mentioned that delinquencies had slackened somewhat.
Reflecting the growth pattern of overall consumer credit, credit
unions experienced a net expansion of member loans in October and Novem-
ber-the first increases in about a year. Credit union lending, however,
remains quite depressed relative to brisk deposit inflows, and as a result
these thrift institutions have continued to build up their already substan-
tial holdings of liquid assets. The National Credit Union Administration
(NCUA) was concerned that a rise in market interest rates during the fourth
quarter would adversely affect the ability of credit unions to extend
credit profitably and would put further pressure on the earnings of these

III-22
institutions. Consequently, the NCUA in early December temporarily
increased the ceiling rate on loans for federal credit unions from 15
percent to 21 percent.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the previous Greenbook the dollar has fluctuated over a
4 percent range and, as illustrated by the chart on the next page,
its weighted-average value has risen by 0.3 percent. Movements against
individual currencies have been somewhat divergent, with the dollar
appreciating by 2-1/2 percent against the German mark and by slightly
smaller amounts against other continental European currencies. Against
the pound sterling and the Japanese yen, the dollar has depreciated
by 4 percent, and against the Canadian dollar the decline was 3/4
percent. Gold prices rose briefly above the $600 per ounce level in
late December, but dropped back to around $560 through mid-January,
most recently falling to about the $520 level.
Interest-rate developments have remained a prominent factor in
exchange-rate movements during the past six weeks, but other influences
also have played a role, especially since the turn of the year. Most
notably, testimony by Chairman Volcker reaffirming the need for tight
monetary policies, concerns about the Polish situation, and expecta-
tions of a resolution of the Iranian hostage situation each were
reported at times to have contributed to strengthening of the dollar.
Following the release of the U.S. hostages on January 20 there have
been few signs of currency diversification by the Iranians -- a source
of market anxiety earlier -- and during the past week the dollar
has moved up further.
Among the European currencies, the German mark has drawn renewed
concern because of Germany's continuing current-account deficit and

signs of somewhat higher inflation. On January 23 the Bundesbank
announced a decrease in German banks' minimum reserve requirements
and an increase in discount quotas (both effective February 1), but
these measures were not intended to ease monetary conditions. Rather,
the expiration of a large repurchase facility at about the same time
will more than offset the liquidity provided by these changes, and
German interbank rates have remained almost unchanged. Nonetheless,
the mark has come under renewed selling pressure, dropping to around
DM 2.08 against the dollar early this week and falling to its lower
limit against the French franc in the EMS arrangement.
At
times during the period, especially in early January, the Japanese
yen came into strong demand,

At present the yen is trading quietly around the Y 202 level.
Since the last Greenbook the Desk has purchased a net of $1.0
billion of foreign currencies, mostly since mid-January. This figure
reflects net acquisitions of about $1.05 billion equivalent of German
marks and sales (for System account) of $50 million equivalent of
Japanese yen early in the month.
.Mark acquisitions
since the last Greenbook have been shared with the Treasury. As a
result, the System's open position in foreign currencies -- largely
comprised of mark balances -- rose to $2.5 billion equivalent as of
yesterday afternoon.

IV-5
Borrowing in international capital markets. Gross medium- and
long-term borrowing in international capital markets picked up consider-
ably in the fourth quarter of 1980, mostly in the form of an increase in
new Eurocurrency bank credits. However, for the year as a whole gross
borrowing was down $5-1/2 billion (5 percent). Eurocredits declined
8 percent in 1980 and foreign bond issues were down 20 percent, but Euro-
bond issues were 27 percent higher. Industrial countries as a group
borrowed more in 1980 than in 1979, but large reductions occurred in
borrowing by the non-OPEC developing countries and the Communist countries,
and OPEC borrowing decreased slightly.
After netting out repayments and refinancings, total borrowing in
1980 came to about $58 billion, down about $8 billion (12 percent) from
the 1979 level. (See table.) In 1980 the amount of advance refinancings
of Eurocredits by borrowers, to obtain better terms, was less than one-half
as large as in the previous year because of the halt in the general decline
in spreads. But scheduled Eurocredit repayments increased last year, as
did also repayments of bonds and issues of Eurobonds by Eurobanks, as a
result of which total repayments and refinancings increased slightly.
The general level of spreads on medium-term Eurocredits has contin-
ued to show little change, although the average spread on loans to non-
OPEC developing countries has risen slightly further reflecting continued
rising spreads on loans to Brazil. Late in 1980 spreads on Eurocredits
to Brazilian public-sector borrowers reached 2 percent, more than double
the level those borrowers were paying in late 1979. In the FR staff's
sample, which covers about two-thirds of all credits, the weighted average
spread for all borrowers moved up slightly to .74 percent in the third

quarter of 1980 from .70 percent in the previous two quarters and .68 per-
cent in the fourth quarter of 1979. The average maturity of Eurocredits
in the third quarter rose somewhat but still remained well below late-1979
levels; on a weighted average basis the sample maturity for all borrowers
was 7.9 years in the third quarter of 1980 compared with 9.6 years in the
final quarter of 1979.
The volume of new medium-term Eurocurrency bank credits rebounded
sharply in the fourth quarter of 1980, in part for seasonal reasons, and
exceeded the year-earlier amount by 25 percent after having fallen well
short of comparable 1979 levels during the first nine months of the year.
Underlying demand for credit appears to have strengthened in the fourth
quarter; in addition, comparison with the fourth quarter of 1979 is
affected by the fact that market conditions in November-December 1979 were
depressed in the aftermath of the U.S. freeze of official Iranian assets,
the Federal Reserve's adoption of its new operating procedure, and restric-
tions on international lending by Japanese banks.
The decline in publicized new medium-term Eurocredits in 1980 as a
whole stemmed partly from the reduction in advance refinancings last year.
However, it also reflected a shift in the pattern of borrowing demand away
from publicized medium-term credits toward short-term credits and unpubli-
cized medium-term credits, e.g., by single-bank lenders. Such a shift is
evidenced by comparison of the publicized medium-term Eurocredits with BIS
data on total international bank lending. While publicized medium-term
Eurocredits extended in the first nine months of 1980 were down 20 percent
from a year earlier on a gross basis and probably more on a net basis, the
rise in total outstanding international banking claims of banks in the BIS

IV-8
reporting area over the same period ($137 billion) was only 8 percent less
than a year earlier.
Issues of foreign bonds in 1980 in all the principal markets for
them -- Germany, Switzerland, Japan, and the United States -- were at
lower levels than in 1979. The contrast with the increased volume of
issues in the Eurobond market, where over two-thirds of the issues were
dollar-denominated, in part reflected investors' more optimistic expecta-
tions about the exchange rate of the dollar relative to the mark, Swiss
franc, and yen. In addition, a high fraction of Eurobond issues consisted
of floating rate notes -- close to 20 percent -- helping to sustain
issues in that market in a year when long-term interest rates twice
climbed to very high levels.
Gross borrowings through medium-term Eurocredits, Eurobonds and
foreign bonds by the industrial countries was up 20 percent in 1980. The
largest increases were by Italy, Australia, and Sweden, while sizable
increases were recorded as well by borrowers in Spain, Denmark, Finland,
the United Kingdom, and the United States. Borrowing by the non-OPEC
developing countries fell 34 percent last year, large declines being
shown by, inter alia, Brazil (from $7.2 billion to $4.4 billion), Mexico,
the Philippines, Korea, and Taiwan. The large decline in borrowings by
the Communist countries mainly reflected a severe cut in borrowing by
China.

U.S. International Transactions
For the first two months of the fourth quarter of 1980 the U.S.
trade deficit averaged $19 billion at an annual rate, up somewhat from
the third-quarter rate, but significantly less than the rate for the
first half of 1980. Trade data for December will be released January

The value of imports in October-November increased about 3.5
percent from the third-quarter average; more than half the increase was
due to price changes. The volume of oil imports rose about 7 percent
above the low third-quarter rate, as U.S. economic activity picked up.
Nevertheless, oil-import volume during the second half of the year was
about 20 percent less than in the first half; this reflects a drawdown
in private inventories as well as a continuation of the fall in the ratio
of U.S. oil consumption to GNP. Average oil import prices in October-
November rose by a little less than 2 percent from the third-quarter
average. Since the last Greenbook the oil exporting countries have
announced price increases averaging 10 percent; these higher prices
should be reflected in the trade data by the end of the first quarter.
Spot prices for petroleum have stabilized as a result of the partial
recovery of exports by Iran and Iraq; they are currently at about the
same level as official contract prices (other than Saudi).

Nonoil imports increased slightly in value in October-November.
Nonmonetary gold imports declined, but there were increases in a wide
range of other commodities, generally reflecting the upturn in U.S.
economic activity. The largest increases were in food (sugar), in-
dustrial supplies (building materials, copper,and chemicals), capital
goods, and automotive imports from Canada. Foreign car imports from

IV -11
countries other than Canada have averaged a steady $18-20 billion annual
rate since the beginning of the year, except for one very strong month
(September).
The value of exports in October-November was marginally above the
third-quarter rate, with the increases entirely attributable to rising
prices. Exports of machinery and industrial supplies (two-thirds of
total nonagricultural exports) edged downward in recent months. Auto-
motive exports, particularly to Canada, increased in October-November.
Agricultural exports, which hit a low in October, moved up again in
November. Based on current indicators, agricultural exports for the
fourth quarter as a whole are expected to be almost equal to the third-
quarter rate.
In international financial transactions there was a small recorded
net private capital inflow between the end of October and the end of
November. An outflow of about $1 billion through banking offices was
roughly offset by an increase in holdings of equities of U.S. cor-
porations by residents of Canada and Western Europe. (See table on U.S.
International Transactions.) For the second month in a row all other
transactions plus the statistical discrepancy (line 7) was negative;
data on service transactions and certain private capital flows are not
yet available, but the sharp swing in line 7 suggests that the extra-
ordinarily large unrecorded inflows in the previous four quarters may
have ended in the fourth quarter of 1980.
Partial data through mid-January indicates continuation of the
moderate outflow through banking offices. Daily average data shown on
the table below, indicate that U.S. banking offices (line C) have

IV -12
advanced about $1 billion to their own foreign offices since November.
In addition, foreign offices of U.S. -based banks reduced their loans
to U.S. nonbank residents by $300 million between November and mid-
January. The reduction in branch loans to U.S. nonbank residents pro-
bably resulted from borrowers exercising their option to borrow at prime
rather than a LIBOR-based rate when the spread of money market rates over
prime increased. Also, money market institutional investors increased

their holdings of Eurodollars slightly in December; a decrease in the
holdings of open-ended money market mutual funds was more than offset
by an increase in the holdings of close-ended unit investment trusts.
In November, as in much of 1980, the net increase in foreign
official reserve holdings in the United States was not the result of
intervention in foreign exchange markets to support the dollar. The
OPEC countries added $1 billion to the $11 billion they had accumulated
in the first ten months of 1980. Partial data for December indicate a
small additional increase ($0.3 billion). The G-10 countries and
Switzerland increased their holdings by $5.5 billion in November, and
partial data indicate an additional inflow of $0.2 billion in December.
U.S. reserve assets increased $1.7 billion in November and $1.3
billion in December, largely as a result of purchases of German marks.
As a result of these purchases the United States ended the year with
sufficient balances to more than cover its outstanding foreign currency
obligations (i.e. Carter bonds).

IV -14
Two international financial transactions occurred in December
that resulted in increases in measures of domestic bank credit. First,
Canada borrowed $300 million under a standby credit facility with U.S.
and other non-Canadian banks. Previous drawings on this facility have
been reflected in part in U.S. bank credit. Second, the Ford Motor
Company borrowed $725 million from U.S. banking offices and reportedly
used most of the proceeds to repay loans from its British and Germany
subsidiaries.

Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity in most
major foreign industrial countries remains weak. In Germany,
preliminary estimates indicate that real GNP growth in the fourth quarter
of last year was negative. Industrial production for the three-month
period ending in November 1980 declined in both France and in the United
Kingdom and was nearly flat in Japan; in both Canada and Italy, industrial
production rose. The increase in economic activity in Italy was possibly
due to the end of strikes in several sectors.
Inflation moderated further in most industrial countries during the
fourth quarter, but both consumer prices and wholesale prices accelerated
somewhat, in Germany and in Italy.
During the fourth quarter the trade balances of both Japan and the
United Kingdom continued the sharp swings toward surplus, that began in
the second quarter of last year. Recent data for most of the other major
foreign countries, especially Canada, suggest that there were some
improvements in their trade balances during the quarter.
There were no significant policy changes abroad, except in Sweden
where monetary policy was tightened.
In Japan, recent data on real economic activity and demand present
a mixed picture. Although real GNP rose sharply in the third quarter
(6.1 percent real growth, s.a.a.r.), industrial activity has remained
weak in recent months. The industrial production index fell in November
by almost 1.5 percent to a level only .3 percent above its third-quarter
average.
In December, the wholesale price index fell by 0.2 percent -- the
third decline in the past four months -- and was more than a percentage

point below its August level. The CPI also fell in December, by about
0.7 percent. Appreciation of the yen and slower growth in the dollar
price of imported products -- particularly petroleum -- have been important
factors in the recent reduction in prices.
In the external sector, the current account improved by almost
$500 million dollars in December to approximate balance. As a result,
the total deficit for 1980 came to $10.8 billion, about $2 billion larger
than in 1979. The improved position in December, which continued the
trend seen throughout the second half of 1980, resulted mainly from an $800
million increase in exports.
Monetary conditions in Japan have continued to show signs of easing.
For the second consecutive month, M-2 growth in November moved upward,
to about an 8 1/2 percent rate on a year-over-year basis, and most short-
term interest rates declined in both November and December. The Bank of
Japan also announced a slight increase in credit-expansion ceilings in the
first quarter for large city banks, but forecast M-2 growth of 7 percent
in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis.
In December the Cabinet approved the proposed budget for FY 1981,
which starts in April. General-account expenditure in the new budget
proposal is almost 10 percent above that of the FY 1980 budget, while
expenditure in the fiscal loan and expenditure program is to be increased
by about 7 percent.
Economic activity in Germany remains weak. According to preliminary
data for 1980, real GNP grew by 1.8 percent, which implies negative
growth in the fourth quarter. Industrial production, which declined
during the first three quarters of last year, remained at the low third-

IV -21
quarter level in October and November. While weakness in production
is evident throughout the economy, it is most pronounced in the chemical
and automobile industries, which are heavily dependent on export sales.
The seasonally-adjusted number of unemployed passed the one-million mark
in December, pushing the rate of unemployment to 4.5 percent.
Inflation, after having slowed through most of last year, accelerated
again in November and December to monthly rates of 0.6 percent in the CPI.
Wholesale prices jumped sharply in November and December. Import prices,
which had been relatively stable since early in 1980 began to rise again
in September and rose by 2.6 percent in November.
The German current account recorded a deficit of $0.8 billion in
November. This brings the deficit for the first eleven months of 1980 to
$15.3 billion, compared with a deficit of $5.5 billion for the same period
in 1979.
In the United Kingdom, there are some indications that the recession
may be nearing bottom: employment vacancies increased in December for the
first time in 18 months and increased again in January; after a prolonged
decline, industrial production has been essentially flat since September;
and the degree of pessimism reflected in various business surveys has
stopped increasing. The unemployment rate, however, rose to 9.3 percent
(s.a.) in January. Unemployment now stands at 2.2 million -- an increase
of two-thirds since January 1979.
CPI inflation declined slightly during the final quarter of last year
compared with the preceding quarter. The current account, reflecting
the decline in U.K. domestic economic activity, recorded a $5 1/2 billion
surplus in 1980 -- a swing of some $9 billion over the 1979 outcome.

IV -22
In the French economy real activity during the final quarter of
last year continued to weaken; but inflation was noticeably improved.
For the three months ending November, industrial production was 3.5 percent
below the previous three months and 4.5 percent below the same period of
1979. In the fourth quarter of 1980, consumer prices rose 11.5 percent
(a.r.), down from a rate of 13.4 percent in the previous quarter.
The trade deficit for 1980 was over $14 billion compared with only
$3 billion in the preceding year, while the current account swung from
surplus of $1 billion to a deficit of $7 billion. The trade deterioration
was due to high oil prices -- oil import payments increased nearly $12
billion in 1980.
The present Bank of France intervention rate of 10 3/4 percent,
which was also the low for 1980, has been unchanged since early November.
However, the M2 growth target for 1981 of 10 percent is 1 percentage point
below last year's target, and credit growth norms are to be tighter in
1981 than in 1980.
Recent data on economic activity in Italy give conflicting indications.
Industrial production in November rose by about 4 percent (not annual rate)
after having been weak since spring. The rebound was concentrated in
certain sectors, in particular motor vechicles, which had been affected
by previous strike activity. Business surveys continue to indicate low
demand and production levels and a generally weak outlook.
Consumer price inflation moderated somewhat in December, the index
rising 1.3 percent after having risen on average by about 2 percent during
each of the previous three months. However, the WPI, which had shown signs
of moderating, jumped 2.2 per cent in November, indicating the persistence

IV -23
of inflationary pressures.
The trade deficit narrowed significantly in November to $1.5 billion
after having averaged $3 billion a month in the previous four months.
The trade deficit for the first eleven months of 1980 was $22 billion,
compared with $5.3 billion for the full year in 1979.
In Canada, industrial production for the three-month period ending
in November rose 1 percent, compared with virtually no increase in the
previous three months. The quarter-over-quarter average rate of consumer
price inflation remained constant at 2.8 percent through the last three
quarters of 1980.
The Canadian trade surplus (s.a.) in November was $1.3 billion,
compared with $700 million in October. The trade surplus for the year is
estimated to have been more than twice the surplus for 1979.
In Sweden, the 1980 fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter rate of
consumer price inflation was 14.7 percent, compared with 9.5 percent in
the previous year. Most of this acceleration was due to higher oil and
housing prices and also to a jump in value-added taxes of 1.9 percentage
points to 22.5 percent in September. Meanwhile, third-quarter data suggest
that the current-account deficit for 1980 will be over $5 billion, nearly
double the deficit in 1979.
On January 20, the Swedish central bank raised the discount rate
from 10 percent to 12 percent and raised the penalty rate on discounting,
for banks that frequently use the discount facility, from 13 percent
to 17 percent. On January 13, the Government of Sweden announced the
budget for FY 1981/82 that shows a net borrowing requirement of $15 billion
-- about 11 percent of expected GDP, compared with an estimated borrowing

IV -24
requirement of 10 percent of GDP in 1980.
In Belgium, the Parliament has imposed a wage freeze from January 1
through February 15. The freeze, which will prevent wage and salary
adjustments in anticipation of later policy steps, is intended to provide
the Parliament with some time in which to consider the restricitive
fiscal policy measures proposed by the Cabinet in November. The Netherlands
National Bank has announced new ceilings on Bank credit expansion for 1981.
Banks may increase short-term and long-term lending not covered by long-term
borrowing by 6 percent in 1981, compared with 7-8 percent allowed last
year.
