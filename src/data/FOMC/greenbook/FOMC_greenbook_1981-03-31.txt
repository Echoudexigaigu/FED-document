The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic growth slowed in February after marked advances in
activity over the preceding six months. Industrial production declined,
employment and income gains moderated, and housing starts fell sharply.
However, consumer spending grew rapidly and'business investment remained
fairly strong in the early part of the year. Overall inflation continued
high despite some easing in food prices.
Industrial Production and Employment
Industrial production declined 0.5 percent in February following
successively smaller increases in each of the three previous months.
Sharp declines occurred in production of construction supplies, trucks,
and household appliances. On the other hand, automobile assemblies rose
7 percent, and reports indicate that they have risen further in March.
Declines in auto output in December and January had played a significant
role in the slowing of the rise in the overall index. Production of
energy materials rose in February, mainly due to stockpiling of coal
in anticipation of a possible strike in late March. Reflecting the drop
in factory output, the index of capacity utilization for manufacturing
declined 0.7 percentage point in February.
The drop in output in February was accompanied by some slackening
in labor demand. Nonfarm payroll employment grew only 50,000--the
smallest monthly gain since employment began rising after the July
trough. Hiring at trade and service establishments continued to
increase at its recent pace, but these gains were largely offset by a
drop in construction jobs and a further slowing in the growth of
manufacturing employment. Additionally, the factory workweek fell more

than 1/2 hour in February, after recovering to about its prerecession
level in January, and the construction workweek plunged 2-1/2 hours.
Particularly sharp reductions in hours in some industries--notably
transportation equipment and construction--were partially attributable
to severe weather conditions in the Midwest and Southeast during the
reference week for the employment surveys. Cutbacks also occurred
among industries located primarily outside the affected regions.
The overall unemployment rate in February was 7.3 percent, about
the same as the rates that have prevailed since last May. Joblessness
among blue collar workers, which had been moving lower during the pre-
ceding six months, was about unchanged in February. The household survey
reported a 230,000 increase in total employment in February. In both
January and February, job gains in the household survey outpaced those
in the establishment survey; in contrast, over the second half of 1980
employment gains in the household report fell short of the rise in the
establishment measure.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Personal income rose at an 8 percent annual rate in February,
down from the 12-3/4 percent rate over the preceding four months.
Holding down income growth in February was the reduction in the factory
workweek, which limited gains in private wages and salaries. The slow-
down in wage and salary growth was partly offset by a leveling off in
social insurance contributions after the payroll tax increase on
January 1. Real disposable personal income in February apparently was
little changed from January at a level only about 1-1/2 percent (annual
rate) above the fourth quarter average--well below the growth rate
recorded over the second half of 1980.

Gains in consumer spending in early 1981 outpaced income growth.
Retail sales rose 1.1 percent in February, following a sharp 2.7 percent
increase in January. A large portion of these increases was due to a
burst in spending at automotive dealerships, but even excluding auto-
mobiles and nonconsumption items, sales grew at a brisk clip. Much of
the strength in sales in the nonautomotive area during January and
February was in the largely discretionary types of spending associated
with stores in the GAF grouping. Sales by these stores also had increased
markedly in the second half of last year.
Auto sales rose sharply in the first part of the year. Total unit
purchases, which had been around a 9 million rate since last July,
surged to a 10.3 million pace in February. The substantial gains in
sales of domestic models--to a 9 million unit rate from about mid-
February through mid-March--have been in large part related to the price
concessions offered by all major domestic producers and likely have come
at the expense of future purchases. Prior to the introduction of the
price rebates, sales of 1981-model cars had been at about 6-3/4 million
unit annual rate. The improvement in sales, along with low rates of
production, succeeded in paring car dealers' inventories; by the end of
February domestic auto stocks were 1.29 million units--the lowest level
since November 1970. These stocks represented 54 days' sales at the
relatively brisk February rate, the lowest days' supply in more than
two years. Sales of imported cars also rose substantially in February,
possibly reflecting some apprehensions by consumers of future import
quotas.

The recent strong gains in consumption have resulted in the
personal saving rate falling more than 2 percentage points from the 6.1
percent level of 1980-Q3. To some extent spending has been supported
by gains in household wealth; financial wealth to income increased
markedly from the first to the fourth quarters of 1980 as a result of
the substantial rise in the stock market.
Residential Construction
Housing activity, which held firm from September through January
despite further increases in interest rates, weakened significantly in
February. Following four months above a 1-1/2 million unit rate, housing
starts dropped to a 1.22 million unit rate in February--the lowest since
last June. Starts of single-family units fell 22 percent in February,
while multifamily starts plunged 30 percent. The former had declined
slightly since last September, and the latter had been trending up
since the middle of last year. Residential building permits declined
in February for the third straight month.
The weakness in new building activity reflects in part declining
levels of home sales. Sales of new and existing houses dropped in
January for the fourth consecutive month to a level about one-fifth
below the recent September peak. Purchases of existing homes fell to
a 2.5 million unit annual rate--a level only slightly above their
depressed pace during the second quarter of last year. New home sales
dropped 6.5 percent in January. On a year-over-year basis, increases
in average transaction prices for houses were the smallest in several
months--prices of new houses were 10 percent higher and those for

existing houses 12 percent higher. The CPI measure of home prices showed
a sharp drop in early 1981; but because this series is based on the
limited sample of FHA-insured homes, its movements are not necessarily
representative of overall changes in house prices.
Business Fixed Investment
Capital spending, on balance, rose substantially in early 1981.
In the structures category, real outlays for construction rose 3.5 per-
cent in January, following a similar increase in December, while oil well
drilling in the first two months of the year was somewhat below the high
level at the end of 1980. In the equipment area, shipments of nondefense
capital goods in real terms in January and February appear to have been
little changed from the fourth quarter pace, but business purchases of
automobiles increased substantially, and sales of heavy-weigt trucks
rose slightly from the extremely low levels of last fall.
Commitments data do not appear to support continued strength in
investment outlays. Constant-dollar new orders for nondefense capital
goods, which were basically unchanged in the second half of last year,
fell an estimated 15 percent in February, following January's 11.3 per-
cent increase. The vigorous construction activity of December and
January may reflect a catchup of projects deferred in the spring and
summer of 1980 by financial conditions and overall economic weakness
rather than an upsurge in demand. Contracts for private nonresidential
plant trended up through November of last year but they were still
below their level a year earlier.

Longer-term indicators of investment demand suggest a modest
advance in real capital spending over the balance of this year. Following
sizable declines in the spring and summer, capital appropriations net of
cancellations of large manufacturers increased 6.2 percent in the fourth
quarter. Most of this rise was in the cyclically sensitive durable goods
sector. The Commerce Department survey of capital spending plans, taken
in January and February, reports that businesses plan to increase out-
lays an average of 10.2 percent in 1981. If this rise were realized
it would leave constant-dollar outlays for 1981 as a whole little changed
from their 1980 level, but would imply some real growth during the
course of this year. It is possible that these relatively strong longer-
term plans, like similar readings reported early last year, were made
assuming more favorable financial conditions than are likely to prevail.
Inventory Investment
Inventories were liquidated over the second half of 1980. In
January, however, constant-dollar stocks rose slightly. This increase
occurred in the manufacturing sector, where it was concentrated in
materials and work-in-process stocks; the finished goods inventories
fell $2.5 billion. This distribution suggests that the rise in manufac-
turers' stocks apparently reflected planned increases rather than an
unexpected weakness in sales. Durable goods stocks accounted for three-
fourths of manufacturers' accumulation; sizable run-ups occurred in
the aircraft, electrical machinery, and steel industries, where increases
in orders were fairly substantial through the end of 1980.

II-18
In the trade sector, the book value of wholesale stocks fell at a
$1.3 billion rate in January, while retail stocks grew at a $7.4 billion
pace after a substantial liquidation in December. The overall accumula-
tion of inventories in January was more than offset by strong sales gains,
and the stock-sales ratio for all manufacturing and trade continued the
downtrend that started last June.
Government Sector
The federal unified budget deficit in the current quarter now is
estimated to be about $31-1/2 billion on the basis of January and February
data. This is about $7-1/2 billion more than earlier projections, and is
due primarily to higher CCC outlays than previously estimated and to less-
than-anticipated revenues from the windfall profits tax as well as
unexpectedly low receipts from the implementation of accelerated personal
and corporate tax payment schedules. The revenue shortfall appears un-
related to underlying economic developments and is not likely to be
reversed later.
The administration's budget revisions submitted to Congress on
March 10 supersede the description of budget proposals presented to
the Congress in President Reagan's February 18 address. For fiscal
year 1982, the administration proposes total Federal outlays (unified
budget) of $695 billion, and with assumed receipts of $650 billion, a
deficit of $45 billion. In comparison with FY 1982 budget proposed by
the Carter Administration in January, the Reagan Administration is
proposing $4-1/2 billion additional defense outlays (net of outlay reduc-
tions assumed by the Reagan Administration from the Carter budget), more
than $15 billion less in direct payments to individuals, and about $30

II-19
billion less in other nondefense spending exclusive of interest. Tighter
restrictions are also proposed on federal credit activities. Major
revenue proposals include a 10 percent reduction in personal income tax
rates effective July 1, 1981, and further reductions to take place on
January 1 of 1982, 1983, and 1984. Business tax cut proposals include a
modified version of the 10-5-3 depreciation proposal widely discussed
last year year. The budget proposals are discussed in more detail in
Appendix II-A.
Recent data suggest some slowing in state and local government
activity. Employment in this sector has been little changed since
September 1980, as nineteen state governments have imposed hiring freezes.
Moreover, in mid-February, the federal government froze CETA hiring.
Partially offsetting the flattening of growth in employment, state and
local construction spending rose 15.6 percent in real terms from November
to January. This rebound came on the heels of prolonged weakness through
most of 1980 and left real construction spending in January some 7 per-
cent below its year-earlier level.
Wages and prices
During 1980 the rapid rise in wage rates sustained upward cost
pressure on prices, and recent data indicate a continuation of large
wage increases in early 1981. The hourly earnings index--a measure of
wage trends for production and nonsupervisory workers in the private
nonfarm economy--rose at only a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in February,
following a 10-3/4 percent rate rise in January. The February level
of the index remained 9-1/2 percent above a year earlier.

Higher rates of joblessness over the past year appear to have
had some--albeit small--restraining influence on wage demands. Data
from the more comprehensive employment cost index show that wage and
salary rates for nonunion workers rose 8 percent in the twelve months
ended in December--a deceleration of 1/2 percentage point from the
preceding year. Recently, Chrysler workers have agreed to forgo further
cost-of-living adjustments and scheduled wage increases for the duration
of their current contracts, which expire in September 1982. In the
past this type of extraordinary development generally appears to have
been limited to cases of acutely troubled companies. Despite the
difficulties faced by the domestic auto industry as a whole, the UAW
recently declined to reopen contracts with Ford and GM. Most recently,
the United Mine Workers and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association
reached a tentative agreement on a contract calling for a 36 percent
increase in wages and benefits over the next three years--about the
same as in their last contract.
Prices continued to rise rapidly on average in early 1981, as
relief in some areas--particularly food and housing--was countered by
the impact of recent OPEC price hikes and domestic oil decontrol. The
rate of increase in the consumer price index decelerated to an 8-3/4
percent annual rate in January, but rebounded to an 11-1/2 percent rate
in February as the effects of complete decontrol of domestic petroleum
began to reach the retail level. Meanwhile, increases in the producer
price index for finished goods remained near the rates in the last half
of 1980. However, a decline in sensitive materials prices that began
in December has provided some sign of relief in cost pressures at the
producer level.

Food price increases so far in 1981 have been far less than
expected, but the moderation mainly appears to reflect temporary
developments. At the consumer level, food prices edged down in January
and rose only a little in February, following several months of rapid
increases. At the producer level, prices for finished consumer foods
and crude foodstuffs both have declined sharply over the first two
months of the year. To a large extent, the slowing in food prices has
been concentrated in the livestock and poultry sectors where marketings
have been relatively high. However, with livestock producers now
reporting losses, current levels of output are not likely to be main-
tained. Moreover, inflation rates generally continue to be high for
other food items.
The OPEC price increases of late 1980 and the lifting of crude
oil price controls on January 28 have led to a surge in energy prices.
At the retail level, energy prices jumped more than 3 percent in
January (not at an annual rate), and 5 percent in February, when the
effects of decontrol began to show up at the consumer level. The run-
up in energy costs, however, may be short-lived, as stocks are ample
and recent private surveys indicate that retail fuel price increases
were moderating in early March.
The January and February declines in the CPI index for home prices
partially offset the effect on the index of further increases in mort-
gage interest rates and consequently held down increases in homeownership
costs. The mortgage rate component is expected to continue to rise over

II-24
the next several months, since the contract rate implicit in the CPI
index is still well below the current level of commitment rates.
The increase in consumer prices for items other than food, energy,
and homeownership in February was about the same as in the closing months
of 1980, despite substantially smaller rises in used car prices than
during the preceding two quarters. In addition, new car prices were
again unchanged as price hikes posted in early January were subsequently
balanced by a wide range of rebate programs and price discounts.

APPENDIX II-A
THE PRESIDENT'S MARCH 10 BUDGET REVISIONS*
Introduction. On March 10, the Administration formally submitted to Con-
gress its revisions of the January budget which had been submitted by the
outgoing Administration. This submission contains budget estimates which
supersede the preliminary estmates in the "Program for Economic Recovery"
reported on February 18. It re-affirms, however, the proposed budget
deficit of $45 billion for fiscal year 1982 originally proposed by Presi-
dent Reagan. Table 1 summarizes the principal features of the new budget.
President Reagan's Outlay Proposals
The Administration's program calls for a substantial slowing in the
growth of federal spending and a significant shift in the budget's priori-
ties. As indicated in Table 1, the President has proposed over $6 billion
in defense program initiatives in fiscal year 1982 (above the $6.6 billion
in new defense proposals requested in the January budget); in addition a
special military pay raise of 5.3 percent is estimated to raise outlays
in FY1982 by $1.9 billion. Net of savings the total increase in defense
outlays is $4.4 billion above the January budget. These increases are
offset by $46 billion in net proposed reductions in spending for nonde-
fense programs (this amount was raised from the February 18 proposal in
order to offset subsequent upward re-estimates and adjustments to program
costs). The major features of the proposed spending cuts are as follows:
* eligibility requirements are tightened in many entitlement
programs (foodstamps, trade adjustment assistance, medicaid, and
secondary social security benefits). See Table 2 for details.
* numerous programs are reduced or terminated, including public
service jobs, impact aid, foreign aid and federal support for
the arts.
* categorical grants--especially for education, health, and social
services--are consolidated into a few block grants. Direct federal
subsidies are reduced for synfuels development and Export-Import
Bank activities.
* public construction projects--wastes treatment, highways and mass
transit--are stretched-out into future years.
* Federal personnel costs are reduced through employment cuts and
pay reforms.
It should be noted that the increase in defense outlays over
earlier proposals for fiscal years 1981 and 1982 does not fully reflect
the increase in military spending embodied in the administration's new
budget. As illustrated in Table 3, the growth of budget authority for
the Defense Department is expected to rise from the 14% rate registered
in fiscal year 1980 to over 25% in fiscal year 1982. In real terms,
* Prepared by Susan Leper, Senior Economist, Government Finance Section,

the President is calling for a 7 percent increase in military outlays for
the coming fiscal year.
Overall the pace of Federal spending in nominal terms is expected
to moderate from fiscal year 1981's 13% rate to 6% in fiscal 1982. In
real terms, this moderation translates into a 2.8% drop in federal
spending in the coming fiscal year. As a result of the slower growth
in spending, the share of GNP devoted to outlays is estimated in the
revised budget to drop from the current 23 percent to 21.8 percent in
fiscal year 1982. The ratio for FY1982 was estimated to be 23 percent
in the January budget.
President Reagan's Revenue Proposals
The tax portion of the President's program proposes sizable cuts
in personal taxes, phased in over a three year period, and a phased-in
reduction in asset depreciation lives which will cut business taxes
substantially. A small portion of the revenue losses from these tax
cuts will be offset by new user charges. Under current law, federal
receipts are estimated to rise from 20.3 % of GNP in 1980 to 23.5%
in 1985. The tax cut package is estimated in the revised budget to
reduce this percentage to 19.3% in 1985 (Table 4).
For individuals, marginal tax rates will be reduced 5 percent in
calendar 1981,1/ 15 percent in calendar 1982, 25 percent in calendar 1983
and 30 percent thereafter, from the current 14 to 70 percent range (Table 5)
The President's proposal, thus, is similar to the "Roth-Kemp" program of
across the board cuts in marginal tax rates of 10 percent per year for
the next 3 years starting on July 1, 1981. However, the President's propo-
sal does not call for indexing the tax system for inflation after the third
year.
For business firms, the President's program proposes an "Accelerated
Cost Recovery System" (ACRS) which is a modified 10-5-3 program of accel-
erated depreciation allowances. Most new investment in machinery and
equipment would be placed in one of two asset classes:
* 3 year class. Automobiles, light trucks, and equipment used in
research and development activities would be depreciated on an
accelerated 3 year schedule.
* 5 year class. All other machinery and equipment, except for some
long-lived public utility property would be depreciated on an
accelerated 5 year schedule.
1/ Withholding rates would be cut 10 percent on July 1, 1981, so the full
year's effect of the 5 percent cut in tax rates would be felt in the
second half of the year. In all subsequent years, withholding tables
would be adjusted January 1 so that withholdings and tax liabilities would
be adjusted on the same schedule.

Real estate and factories would be placed in one of the following 3 asset
classes.
* 10 year class. Factory buildings, retail stores, and ware-
houses used by their owners would be depreciated on an
accelerated 10-year schedule. Public utility property for
which present guideline lives exceed 18 years is also
included in this class.
* 15 year class. Nonresidential structures not included in the
10-year class and low income rental housing would be depre-
ciated over 15 years on a straight-line schedule.
* 18 year class. Other residential rental structures would
be depreciated on a straight-line schedule over an 18-year
period.
The full 10 percent investment tax credit would apply to machinery
and equipment in the 5 year class and the public utility equipment included
in the 10-year class (factories, stores, and warehouses in the 10-year class
would not receive any credit, consistent with current law). A 6 percent
credit would be received for assets in the 3-year class. Under current law
assets with a life of less than 3 years receive no credit, a 3-1/3 percent
credit is received for assets with a useful life between 3 and 5 years, a
6-2/3 percent credit is received by assets with a life between 5 and 7 years,
and the full 10 percent credit is received by assets whose life exceeds 7
years.
The proposed reduction in asset lives would be phased in over a
3 to 5 year period. Assets in the 5 year class could be assigned a useful
life as long as 9 years if acquired in 1981. The maximum life assignable
to new investments in this class would then be reduced to 5 years over
the next 4 years. New investment in the 10-year class would have an 18
year life in 1981. The recovery period for new investments in this class
would be reduced annually in 2 year increments until a 10 year useful life
is established for new assets acquired in 1985 and thereafter. Similarly,
recovery periods in the 15 year class are phased in over 3 years, beginning
at 18 years in 1981 and reaching 15 years in 1983.
The tax program also includes new user fees to reduce or eliminate
subsidies to airport and airway users, inland waterway users, and boat and
yacht users; passport and visa fees and railroad retirement taxes are also
to be increased. These changes, together with a reform ofFederal employee
injury compensation and administrative speed-up in payment of alcohol and
tobacco excise taxes, are expected to raise $3.1 billion in FY1982 and $3.0
billion in FY1983.
President Reagan's Credit Budget Proposals
The administration is proposing substantial reductions in the size
and scope of the Federal credit budget. These reductions will affect both

II-A-9
on-budget and off-budget loan transactions. The total of direct loan obli-
gations and loan guarantee commitments is estimated to be $13.6 billion
below the January budget for FY1981 and $21.0 billion lower in FY1982 as
shown in Table 6. Some of the important features of the new credit budget
are as follows:
* Federal Financing Bank operations are to be reformed in a way
that will diminish the borrowing ability of several agencies
such as the Rural Electrification, Administration and Farmers
Home Administration.
* The largest reductions in direct loan obligations are for rural
and agricultural development programs of the Rural Electrification
Administration and the Farmers Home Administration. Sizable reduc-
tions will also effect programs in the Export-Import Bank that sub-
sidize exports.
* In an effort to reduce subsidies to middle and upper income
families, loan guarantee commitments for the Federal Housing Admi-
nistration mortgage insurance program will be reduced by $4.8 bil-
lion in 1981 and $9 billion in 1982. Government National Mortgage
Association guarantees of mortgage-backed securities will be reduced
by $8 billion in both 1981 and 1982, and the GNMA tandem mortgage
assistance program will gradually be terminated.
* Significant reductions are proposed in the Guaranteed Student Loan
program by more directly targeting these loans to needy students.
The amount of the loans will be further limited through the curtail-
ment of their purchase on the secondary market by the Student Loan
Marketing Association, which will no longer have access to borrowing
from the FFB.
Comparison of Economic Assumptions and Budget Projections
The economic outlook presented with President Reagan's budget propo-
sals differs significantly from the Carter
Administration's earlier forecast and from the current Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) forecast. The projection of the Reagan Administration differs
from the other forecasts in expecting faster growth in real GNP and lower
unemployment and interest rates in 1982.
Table 7 shows that the Reagan administration now forecasts a 1.4 per-
cent increase in real GNP between the fourth quarter of 1980 and the fourth
quarter of 1981, only slightly less than the 1.7 percent rise forecast by
the Carter Administration. A lull in economic activity is expected in the
second quarter of 1980 by the Reagan Adminitration. As a result, unemploy-
ment rises in mid-year. The subsequent economic recovery forecast by the
Reagan Administration is expected, however, to result in a 7.7 percent
unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 1981.

In 1982, the Reagan administration expects that real GNP will rise
by 5.2 percent and that unemployment will fall further to 7.0 percent by the
final quarter of the year. This contrasts with much slower growth of real
GNP in the Carter and CBO forecasts. Inflation (as measured by the GNP
deflator) is expected by the Reagan administration to slow to 7.7 percent
during 1982; the three-month Treasury bill rate in the Reagan forecast is
assumed to fall from 11.1 percent in 1981 to 8.9 percent in 1982.
The Congressional Budget Office reports that their economic assumptins
imply $13.5 billion higher outlays than are estimated by the Administration.
In addition, technical re-estimates of the President's budget imply $12.8
billion higher outlays in FY1982, apart from the effect of economic assump-
tions; defense spending is estimated to be $5.1 billion higher.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The narrow monetary aggregates, adjusted to remove the effects of
shifts into NOW accounts, appear to be growing briskly in March. How-
ever, this follows very sluggish performance over the preceding few months
and leaves the average for the first quarter as a whole exceptionally weak
relative to the rapid growth of nominal GNP. M-2 expansion also is esti-
mated to be accelerating in March, reflecting not only the pickup in M-1B
but also the continued upsurge in money market mutual fund assets and a
strengthening in small time and savings deposits.
Given the weakness of the narrow monetary aggregates on average
during the intermeeting period, demands for additional reserves fell
short of the amounts provided through open market operations. Borrowing
at the discount window diminished, and the federal funds rate eased by
about 4 percentage points between early February and mid-March. In
recent days, depository institutions have experienced some firming of
their reserve positions, and money market rates have turned upward.
Short-term rates generally are now 2 to 4 percentage points below their
early February levels.
Market rates have been rather volatile in recent weeks, apparently
reflecting uncertainties regarding the monetary statistics, fiscal
policy, and the economic outlook. The concerns of investors about prospec-
tive developments have perhaps been manifested most clearly in the long-
term markets, where rates have responded much less markedly than they
did last spring to the easing of money markets. Indeed, bond yields are
little changed on balance over the intermeeting period, and mortgage rates
in the primary market have risen since early February.

III-3
The prime rate has, as usual, lagged declines in market rates, and
this has contributed to a redirection of short-term business credit flows
from banks to other sources. Business loans at all banks moderated in
February, and at large banks a contraction of these loans last month has
been extended into early March. Growth of nonfinancial commercial paper,
meanwhile, has remained robust. Public bond offerings have picked up, but
stock issuance has declined from the extraordinary pace of the final quarter
of 1980, and overall, the flow of long-term funds to nonfinancial corpora-
tions appears to have increased less since the beginning of the year than
short-term borrowing has fallen. The government sector has continued to
place heavy demands on credit markets. State and local government borrowing
has been moderated by reduced issuance of housing bonds, but the Treasury
has been obliged to cover a quarterly budget deficit of $36 billion. Mort-
gage market activity evidently has been slowing, despite reports of growing
reliance on nontraditional financing.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The narrow monetary aggregates continue to be affected by substan-
tial--albeit diminishing--inflows to interest-bearing transactions accounts.
Information from depository institutions and households suggests that the
proportion of funds flowing into new NOW accounts from demand deposits
declined from about 80 percent in January to around 75 percent in February
and March.1 M-1A and M-1B--adjusted to remove the distorting effects of
shifts to NOW accounts--are estimated to have rebounded in March to annual
growth rates of just under 11 percent, after declining in February.
1. Evidence on the sources of funds flowing into NOW accounts and on
the terms under which NOW accounts are being offered at commercial banks
and thrifts is presented in Appendix III-A.

In the first quarter the adjusted narrow aggregates were about
unchanged from their average levels in the fourth quarter. Part of the
sluggishness may have been a lagged response to increased interest rates
in late 1980, but growth in the narrow aggregates has been much weaker
than would be expected on the basis of historical relationships among
narrow money, income, and interest rates. The standard money demand
equation in the Board's econometric model and a variant designed to
capture incentives for adoption of new cash management techniques both
overpredict growth in adjusted narrow money in the first quarter by more
than 6 percent at an annual rate. As in other periods of apparent sub-
stantial downward shift in money demand, weakness in demand deposits has
accounted for most of the shortfall. However, currency growth also has
been weak in the first quarter.
M-2 expansion also picked up in March, posting an estimated 19 per-
cent annual rate of growth, after expanding at a 7-3/4 percent pace in
February. For the entire first quarter, M-2 growth is calculated at a
7-1/4 percent annual rate, implying a rise in M-2 velocity that is also
sizable by historical standards.
Growth in the nontransactions component of M-2 increased markedly
in February and March, as the runoff in savings deposits slowed both months
and in March growth in small time deposits showed renewed strength.1
However, the recent strength in M-2 reflects, in large part, the rapid
increase in money market mutual fund shares. MMMFs experienced record
1. Adjusted for shifts to NOW accounts, the estimated runoff in the sav-
ings components of M-2 would be 11-1/4 percent in March; 25-1/4 percent
in February; and 40-1/2 percent in January.

gains of about $11-1/2 billion in February (month-average basis), and
inflows are likely to be even larger in March.
It is difficult to assess from what sources the funds that have been
swelling MMMFs have been diverted. Noncompetitive tenders at Treasury
auctions have slackened, savings bond redemptions are up sharply, and some
reports indicate that funds may be flowing from the stock market. Never-
theless, it is fairly clear that much of the inflow into MMMFs would
otherwise have been held in savings and small time accounts at depository
institutions. The publicly-quoted yields on MMMFs have exceeded the
effective rates offered on 6-month MMCs since December.1 Coincident
with this development were the record inflows at MMMFs and weakened
consumer deposit flows at commercial banks and thrifts (see chart on page
III-6). Most of the recent MMMF asset growth was at broker/dealer and
general purpose funds that sell shares to individuals. Moreover, there
has been a substantial increase in the number of shareholder accounts in
recent months.
M-3 expansion is estimated to have accelerated in March after slow-
ing in February, as faster M-2 growth more than offset declines in large
time deposits at both banks and thrift institutions. (The decline in
large time deposits was larger on a net than on a gross basis because
MMMFs made sizable acquisitions of these instruments.) In part, the weak-
ness of large time deposits may reflect a dropoff in earning asset expan-
sion at both banks and thrifts, as well as market responses to the operating
1. These rates are not directly comparable, although depositors may well
regard them as so. The yield on MMMFs reflects recent experience rather
than prospective returns. In contrast, rates quoted for MMCs are guaran-
teed for the life of the instrument.

losses and eroding net worth of the latter institutions. The issuance of
large CDs by insured S&Ls fell from $2.4 billion in December to only
about $500 million in both January and February.1 The estimated growth
of M-3 in March also was moderated by a decline in term RPs.
Bank credit in February expanded at an 8-1/4 percent annual rate--
about one-half the January pace. Some of the deceleration reflected
reduced acquisition of investments and a decline in security loans.
Judging from data for large banks, consumer lending may have contracted
further in February. In contrast, real estate lending at commercial
banks rebounded sharply from its January slowdown.
Business lending--excluding acceptances--decelerated sharply in
February, reflecting a contraction at large banks. (Data for weekly
reporting banks suggest that the weakness has continued into March.)
At least two "special factors" contributed to the deceleration: loans to
U.S. resident firms by foreign branches of domestically-chartered banks
increased $1.2 billion in February, and Ford Motor Company utilized funds
borrowed by its foreign subsidiaries in Eurodollar markets to reduce U.S.
bank loans. In any event, the February Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
did suggest a weakening in loan demand. The Survey also indicated that
banks had eased their qualifying criteria and compensating balance
requirements (see Appendix III-B). Moreover, as the spread of the prime
rate over market rates widened, the relative importance of below-prime
lending increased sharply. According to the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending,
1. Thrift institutions also have faced difficulties in the commercial
paper market. The commercial paper ratings of nine large S&Ls have
been downgraded in March, and the market was said to be unreceptive to
all but the highest-rated issuers.

more than 70 percent of gross short-term loans at 48 large banks was
extended at interest rates below prime during the February survey week.
This compares with about 20 percent in the November Survey, when market
rates and the prime were in closer alignment. The increase in below-prime
lending in February was especially noticeable at large New York City
banks, many of whose customers might be expected to have access to commer-
cial paper and Eurodollar markets.
Business Finance
A great deal of the below-prime lending by banks is for very short
periods--often overnight--and represents a means of competing with the
commercial paper market while maintaining higher margins on loans to
smaller or less credit worthy customers. However, below-prime lending
has not prevented a sizable shift to the paper market. The growth of
nonfinancial commercial paper slowed somewhat in February, but the increase
was still the second largest since last June. Moreover, figures for early
March show a reacceleration of growth. The combined growth of nonfinancial
commercial paper and business loans at banks has fallen off substantially
from the rapid pace of previous months.
The volume of publicly-offered corporate bonds has been sizable
thus far in 1981, particularly when compared with late 1980 when rates
were at similarly high levels. Gross offerings are estimated to have
averaged about $3.6 billion per month, seasonally adjusted, during the
current quarter. This pace was slightly greater than the record monthly
average set in 1980 and 50 percent higher than in the fourth quarter.
The pickup in issuance has reflected increased borrowing by industrial
firms. With interest rates remaining high, there has been a continued

emphasis on relatively short maturities, and many issuers have used con-
vertible debentures.1
Private placements of corporate bonds are estimated to have remained
sluggish, as life insurance companies--the principal suppliers of such
funds--have been confronted with renewed liquidity pressures. With inter-
est rates at very high levels, policy loans rose sharply in December and
are estimated to have increased further in January (see table on page
III-12). Insurers reportedly also are reluctant to acquire long-term,
fixed-rate assets in an environment of great uncertainty about future
interest rates. New commitments by life insurance companies to purchase
corporate bonds edged up in the fourth quarter, but remained quite weak
by historical standards. Commitments outstanding at the end of 1980
were more than 50 percent below a year earlier.
In the stock market, most major price indexes have risen 6 to 7
percent since the February FOMC meeting. Market analysts attributed
much of the gain to an increase in takeover activity and to the drop in
short-term interest rates. New equity offerings, although dropping off
from the extraordinary rate of late 1980, have continued strong. The
average monthly pace of new offerings in the current quarter is estimated
at $1.4 billion (seasonally adjusted)--just below the record pace in
1980.
1. Another interesting adaptation to current high rates has been the
issuance of a few deep discount bonds. Investors apparently will accept
a comparatively low yield for this type of security. The discount pro-
vides a type of call protection, and the below-market coupon gives greater
certainty of total yield. On the other hand, much of the cash return is
realized only at maturity.

Government Finance
During the first quarter, the Treasury faced an exceptionally large
deficit and experienced $3 billion in redemptions of savings bonds-the
largest runoff since the opening months of 1980. These financing needs
were met by issuing $37 billion (not seasonally adjusted) of marketable
debt, split about evenly between bills and coupon issues. The Treasury
obtained nearly $12 billion in the regular weekly and monthly bill auctions
and raised $7 billion in cash management issues. The remainder of the
funds came from a variety of short- and intermediate-term notes and long-
term bonds.
Borrowing by federally-sponsored credit agencies is estimated at
$2.5 billion for the first quarter, with the Federal Farm Credit Banks
raising $2 billion. Federal Home Loan Banks also borrowed heavily through-
out the quarter with the proceeds being used to maintain System liquidity--
now over $5 billion. (FHLB advances to S&Ls have increased steeply on a
seasonally adjusted basis since the beginning of the year, but are little
changed on an unadjusted basis.) The Federal National Mortgage Association
is estimated to have run off about $100 million of debt in March, following
a reduction of $850 million during the preceding two months. This decline
reflects a lack of mortgage purchases by FNMA this quarter as well as a
reduction in its liquidity.
Gross long-term debt issuance by state and local governments was
only somewhat reduced during the first three months of 1981, despite a
sharp drop-off in sales of mortgage revenue bonds. On a seasonally
adjusted basis, state and local bond volume in March is estimated to be
$3-1/4 billion--up slightly from February. This pace was just $400 million

III-16
less than the monthly average in the fourth quarter of last year when
housing bonds accounted for an unusually large proportion of total issu-
ance. New York City reentered the short-term market in February with a
borrowing package that included $100 million of tax anticipation notes
backed by its own property taxes; this was the first such unassisted
offering by New York City since 1974. This sale was followed in March
by a $75 million serial bond offering.
The increased volatility and generally higher level of interest
rates during the last year has led to new financing methods in municipal
bond markets. Two of these techniques are designed to protect investors
against increases in rates: floating-rate bonds-of which about $270 mil-
lion have been issued since May of last year--and the tender option secur-
ity, which was introduced in December. Tender option issues enable the
purchasers to put the bonds back to the issuer at par; about $500 million
of single-family mortgage revenue bonds were sold by this method in Febru-
ary and March.1 In addition, a long-term issue with warrants to purchase
additional bonds at a fixed interest rate was marketed early this year
by the Municipal Assistance Corporation for New York City; this technique
affords the investor some protection against interest rate declines.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on fixed-rate home mortgages have stabilized in the
primary market, after rising about 40 basis points in the weeks immediately
1. The bondholder can tender the bonds to the issuer at par plus interest
on the fifth anniversary and each anniversary thereafter, until the bonds
either mature or are called. The obligation to purchase these tender-
option bonds is supported by a bank's irrevocable letter of credit that
remains in force so long as the issuer does not default on the original
bonds.

III-17
following the last FOMC meeting. The national average contract interest
rate on new commitments for 30-year, 80-percent, fixed-rate loans at a
sample of S&Ls has remained at 15.40 percent since March 6. The return
on fixed-rate home mortgages has risen relative to yields on bonds; the
gross yield spread over the Board's Aaa utility bond index reached 140
basis points in mid-March--the widest margin since early 1980. Field
reports suggest that average initial interest rates on renegotiable-rate
mortgages also have risen, on balance, during the intermeeting period.
Secondary market yields on 13-1/2 percent level-payment FHA/VA home
loans rose further through early March, and deepening discounts became a
major deterrent to originations. The ceiling rate on these loans was
raised by HUD to 14 percent on March 9, reducing discounts by about 3
points. GNMA security prices have changed little on balance since then,
and discounts on forward delivery GNMA issues reflecting the new ceiling
rate averaged just over 5 points on March 23.
The high mortgage rates, in part, have reflected concern among tra-
ditional lenders about future mortgage prices and costs of funds.1 And,
lenders who raise funds at the short end of the market have continued to
seek adjustable rate instruments that would provide returns responsive
to changing market conditions. However, offerings of adjustable-rate loans
apparently have been discouraged by uncertainties regarding pending federal
regulations, limited secondary markets, and provisions of some state laws.2
1. Fixed-rate long-term conventional home mortgages were not available
at about a fourth of all major lenders in early February. At that time,
74 percent of respondents indicated that they were offering 30-year, 80-
percent loans--somewhat above the depressed 68 percent February 1980
level but well below the high several years earlier.
2. On March 23 the Controller of the Currency issued final regulations
allowing rates on adjustable-rate mortgages made by national banks to
increase by as much as 2 percentage points each year.

Credit on existing homes is increasingly being supplied at below-
market rates in many transactions through assumptions of outstanding
mortgages, wrap-around loans, and seller take-backs of second mortgages.
The broader use of these techniques has reduced the flow of prepayments
of principal on portfolios of older loans. These factors--along with lower
home sales--helped decrease flows from amortization and prepayments at
S&Ls in February to one of the lowest levels relative to mortgage holdings
in more than two decades (see chart on page III-20). The reduced payoff
rate on mortgage portfolios, in turn, has limited S&L opportunities to
improve earnings by reinvesting the proceeds of repayments at current
market yields.
Faced with generally weak inflows of funds and continuing financial
uncertainties, S&Ls cut back new mortgage commitments further in February
to the lowest volume since last May. New loans closed also declined as did
the net increase in mortgage holdings, and the backlog of mortgage commit-
ments outstanding edged down for the third consecutive month to a level 7
percent below last September's high.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding increased at a 3-1/2 percent
annual rate in January, extending the moderate recovery in such borrowing
into its sixth month. Installment credit expanded at most types of lenders,
with finance companies--led by the subsidiaries of the auto makers--record-
ing a 17 percent rate of growth. In contrast, consumer receivables at com-
mercial banks contracted in January, with the weakness concentrated in
automobile credit. Bank installment credit has contracted steadily for
almost a year, but the January decline was the largest since last July.

The retrenchment at banks evidently continued in February, as net declines
were reported among the large weekly reporting institutions.
The continued weakness of consumer credit at commercial banks has
reflected, in part, an increased reluctance to make such loans. In the
February Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, nearly 20 percent of the
respondents had become less willing to make consumer loans than last
November. The weakness of bank consumer lending also may reflect upward
movements of finance rates at these institutions. Average new-car loan
rates at banks rose from 14.3 percent in November to 15.8 percent in
February--a high for the series.1 (See chart on page 111-22.) In contrast,
new-car rates at auto finance companies edged down slightly between Novem-
ber and February, as rate policies at captive finance companies apparently
continue to reflect support for their parent organizations. This pattern
continued a general shift toward relatively higher rates on auto financing
at banks that has developed during the last two years.
Lenders have persisted in their efforts to enhance the return on
consumer credit. In the face of high money costs, additional banks have
imposed annual cardholder fees, and many have raised finance rates where
statutes allow. Several Philadelphia banks and a major bank in Maryland
are moving their credit card operations to Delaware, where a revised state
law now permits user fees on card accounts and has eliminated ceilings on
finance rates. Montgomery Ward also announced in early March that it was
tightening credit standards and increasing its minimum monthly payment
requirement.
1. Removal of statutory rate ceilings on consumer loans in New York state
on December 1 resulted in some sharp rate increases among New York banks.
Such increases accounted for only about 20 of the 150 basis points increase
in the national average, however.

III-24
Delinquency rates on consumer installment credit dropped in the
fourth quarter at commercial banks and (through February) at auto finance
companies. Although personal bankruptcy statistics have been volatile on
a monthly basis, filings in January were well below their October peak.

APPENDIX A*
NOW ACCOUNT DEVELOPMENTS IN EARLY 1981
Heavy promotional activity beginning last year at depository
institutions contributed to rapid shifts of funds to interest-bearing
"other checkable deposits" (OCD) following the introduction of nation-
wide NOW accounts on December 31, 1980. OCD surged by more than $16
billion in January on a month average basis, with the bulk of the
expansion occurring in the first two weeks of the month. Adjustment
by the public to the new account has proceeded more moderately since
mid-January; OCD expanded nearly $8 billion in February and a projected
$5-1/4 billion in March.1 Commercial banks have accounted for about 85
percent of the growth in OCD since year-end.
Knowledge of the sources of funds flowing into NOW accounts is
critical to interpreting movements in the narrow monetary aggregates.
Because such information cannot be obtained on a precise basis using
only reported deposit data, the staff has relied on information from a
variety of sources. The available evidence suggests that roughly four-
fifths of net inflows to new NOW/ATS accounts in January was shifted
or diverted from demand deposits and nearly all of the remainder came
from savings deposits. The fraction from demand deposits is thought
to have fallen to about three-fourths in February and March.2
* Prepared by John R. Williams, Economist, Banking Section, Division
of Research and Statistics.
1. Despite higher reserve requirements on NOWs than on ATS, the
relative simplicity and public awareness of NOWs apparently makes them
far more marketable. By early March, the net increase in OCD consisted
of a nearly $32 billion increase in NOWs and about a $4-1/2 billion con-
traction in outstanding ATS accounts. The higher reserve requirement
cost of NOWs reflects a provision of the Monetary Control Act of 1980
that any new types of accounts authorized after April 1, 1980 would
immediately be subject to full reserve requirements, rather than to a
phase-in of such requirements. The difference in the cost of investable
funds obtained through ATS accounts relative to NOWs due to unequal
treatment for reserve requirements is 43 basis points for member banks
and 65 basis points for nonmember institutions.
2. To calculate adjusted M-1A each month, the assumed fraction from
demand deposits is applied to the net increase in OCD (less its esti-
mated $200 million per month trend growth) and the resultant value is
added cumulatively to observed M-1A. To calculate adjusted M-1B, the
assumed fraction from other sources (one minus the fraction from demand
deposits) is applied to the net increase in OCD in excess of trend and
the resultant value is subtracted from observed M-1B.
III-A-1

III-A-2
Staff estimates of the sources of OCD have been based principally on
results of informal samplings of commercial banks conducted this year on
January 14, January 31, and March 11 by the Reserve Banks and on a similar
survey of S&Ls conducted on January 31 by the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board. Nine commercial banks in each Federal Reserve district (three
with total deposits of $1 billion and above, three with total deposits
of $250 million to $1 billion, three with total deposits less than $250
million) were asked to estimate the sources of recent inflows to new
NOW accounts. Although the sample is far too small to permit precise
estimates, the mean response of the 30 banks outside the Northeast in
each size class, weighted by the volume of NOW accounts in each size
class, provides a rough approximation. The two January surveys suggested
that just over 80 percent of net funds flowing to new NOW/ATS accounts
at commercial banks in January would have been held in demand deposits
in the absence of NOWs. The S&L respondents indicated that in January
roughly 60 percent of inflows to new NOW accounts originated outside
these institutions, suggesting that perhaps about 50 percent came from
demand deposits.1 Applying these rough estimates to the NOW market
shares held by commercial banks and thrifts yields an overall estimate
in the range of 75 to 80 percent from demand deposits for January.
A fraction in this range is confirmed by two other unrelated
approaches. First, interviews of about 700 households were conducted in
mid-February by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan.
Depositors that had opened a new interest-bearing transaction account
since NOWs were authorized nationwide estimated on average that between
76 and 80 percent of the initial balances used to get the account
started would otherwise have been in demand deposits. Second, econo-
metric methods, utilizing cross-section regressions of reported deposit
flows, suggest that nearly 80 percent of new OCD in January came from
demand deposits.
Recently available data from the mid-March Reserve Bank survey
of commercial banks suggest a slight decline at sample commercial banks
in the proportion of inflows to new OCD accounts estimated to come from
1. Lacking further evidence, the latter figure assumes that roughly
four-fifths of funds from outside S&Ls were shifted or diverted from
demand deposits.

III-A-3
demand deposits during the period from February 1 to March 11. How-
ever, the average survey response was still close to 80 percent.1
The fraction of inflows to new NOW accounts thus far in 1981
estimated to come from demand deposits is a bit higher than would have
been expected on the basis of historical experience with NOW accounts in
the Northeast and with ATS accounts nationwide.2 In part, this appears
to reflect the marketing strategies adopted by institutions outside the
Northeast. Commercial banks typically have required high minimum
balances--usually $1000 or more to avoid service charges--apparently to
discourage shifting by small depositors while retaining the large
depositors who evidently have tended to react most rapidly to the advent
of NOWs. In contrast, at S&Ls minimum balance requirements for charge-
free accounts seldom exceed $500, apparently reflecting an attempt to
overcome the inertia of customers to retain transaction accounts at com-
merical banks. The minimum balance requirements at banks, which are
larger than in the Northeast, apparently have discouraged shifting by
smaller depositors who would have to consolidate transaction and non-
transaction accounts. Thus, much of the early shifting to NOW accounts
1. To monitor developments in the remainder of 1981, another informal
survey of commercial banks will be conducted by Reserve Banks in April
and similar formal surveys of about 400 banks will be conducted quarterly
beginning in May. In addition, results of another informal survey of
S&Ls by the FHLBB in March will be available by the end of March. The
FHLBB has expressed a willingness to repeat their informal surveys of
S&Ls later in 1981 as needed. Also, the household interviews conducted
by the Survey Research Center are being repeated in March and April at
another sample of 700 households and may be conducted again in some later
months during the year, with results available around the ends- of each
such month. Finally, the econometric analysis of deposit flows will be
repeated as subsequent data become available.
Each of the commercial bank and S&L surveys also provides data on
the number of NOW accounts. Monitoring growth in the number of accounts
over the course of the year will provide a further indication of the pro-
gress of the public's adjustment to this new account.
2. A variety of evidence suggests that roughly two-thirds of NOW/ATS
balances prior to 1981 were shifted or diverted from commercial bank
demand deposits. Such evidence includes: (1) results of surveys of
sources of ATS balances at commercial banks conducted in late 1978
and late 1980; (2) behavior in the 1970s of household demand deposits
in Massachusetts--the only individual state for which such data are
available--compared to the national average; and (3) relationships among
observed turnover rates, minimum balance requirements, and account sizes
for various kinds of household transaction accounts.

III-A-4
apparently was done promptly in January by large demand deposit
customers--who easily satisfied minimum balance requirements without
transferring funds from savings or other accounts--producing the high
proportion from demand deposits. Supporting evidence of this develop-
ment can be found in the average size of NOW accounts, which was nearly
$5,000 at commercial banks in January and $1,300 at S&Ls; the commercial
bank average is much higher than in New England.1 Moreover, nearly half
of the sampled commercial banks outside the Northeast allow customers to
satisfy minimum balance requirements by holding funds in accounts other
than NOWs, compared to only about 10 percent in the Northeast. On
average, such banks estimated that about a third of their customers
utilize this option; thus, even small depositors at commercial banks may
avoid transfers of savings to NOWs.
At present, the staff expects that a slowly declining proportion
of new NOW growth will come from demand deposits as the current year
progresses. The expectation is based in part on the slight drop in this
fraction apparent in the March survey of commercial banks. It also
reflects the likelihood that a further decline towards the two-thirds
figure assumed for shifts to OCD prior to 1981 will occur as NOW accounts
are opened by smaller depositors, who are more apt to consolidate demand
deposits and savings deposits in a NOW account. Indeed, the share of
the NOW market held by S&Ls may rise at the same time. These judgments
will be reviewed throughout the year as new evidence becomes available.
1. Among the large customers shifting to NOWs at the earliest opportunity
in January were sole proprietorships, labor unions, trade associations,
pension funds, and other non-household entities. Roughly 13 percent of
NOW balances outside the Northeast are held by other than individuals,
compared to only 6 percent in New England. Although eligibility require-
ments for NOW accounts are not substantively different from when these
accounts were first authorized in New England, publicity regarding those
eligible has heightened since passage of the Monetary Control Act. The
higher proportion of NOWs held by non-household entities outside New England
may reflect greater awareness by those eligible, as well as the higher
minimum balance requirements.

APPENDIX B*
SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES
One-third of the 118 respondents to the February 15th Senior
Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported that
business loan demand had fallen over the previous three months.1
About one-fourth of the respondents anticipated a decline in business
loan demand over the next three months. At the time of the survey,
the prime rate was nearly 350 basis points above its mid-November level,
and the spread of the prime rate over the commercial paper rate was
substantially wider than in November. The reported weakness in busi-
ness loan demand may have reflected some shifting of substantially
weaker business demand for short-term credit from banks to the com-
mercial paper market, where financing activity picked up sharply
between surveys. It appears also to have reflected some substitution
of long-term, bond-market financing for bank loans.
Although respondents indicated essentially unchanged willingness
to make business loans, the number of banks reporting an easing
exceeded the number reporting a firming of nonprice terms on business
loans. The juxtaposition of unchanged willingness to lend and easing
of nonprice terms would be consistent with an attempt by some banks to
sustain their flow of bookings in the face of moderating demands for
business loans. Evidence of an easing of nonprice terms included
reduction in compensating balance requirements by about one-fifth of
survey respondents.2 In addition, somewhat smaller proportion of
* Prepared by Warren T. Trepeta, Economist, Banking Section, Division
of Research and Statistics.
1. This proportion appears small in light of the dramatic drop in the
growth rate of business loans at domestic offices of large commercial
banks between November and February. However, the survey does not
specify precisely the meaning of "loan demand", which some respondents
may interpret to include the demand for lines of credit. Unused com-
mercial and industrial loan commitments at large banks rose sharply
relative to loans made under commitment in the November-January period.
In addition, some respondents may include in domestic office loan
demand those demands expressed at domestic offices but satisfied through
bookings at foreign branches. The weakness in business loan growth
at large banks in the first two months of 1981 in part reflects book-
ing of about $2 billion of loans to U.S. firms at foreign branches of
domestically chartered banks.
2. When market interest rates increase, as they did on balance between
the November and February surveys, banks'earnings per dollar of compensa-
ting balances also rise and the quantity of balances needed to compensate
banks for a given quantity of credit services declines. Consequently,
during and after a rise in interest rates, banks might be expected to
ease compensating balance requirements on new and renegotiated loan com-
mitments and takedowns. The easing reported in the February survey could
be either such a response to higher interest rates or a continuation of
the reported trend toward substitution of explicit fees for compensating
balances, as well as an attempt by banks to pursue moderating loan demands.
III-B-1

III-B-2
respondents indicated that in the November-February period they had
relaxed standards to qualify for the prime rate or for a given spread
above prime. Respondents reported an essentially unchanged stance on
lending to new and nonlocal customers, as well as to established and
local customers.
Although respondents' willingness to make short-term, fixed-rate
loans remained unchanged on balance between November and February, it
apparently was low, given that respondents generally had reported
reduced willingness to make such loans since February 1978. Meanwhile,
a substantial minority of banks continues to report reduced willingness
to offer fixed rates on long-term loans, probably because they remain
uncertain about long-run interest rate trends.
As in November, the number of respondents indicating reduced
willingness to make both consumer installment loans and residential
mortgages exceeded the number reporting increased willingness. Several
respondents indicated in supplementary comments that their reluctance
to make such loans stemmed from the fact that these loans bear fixed
rates or, in the case of variable-rate mortgages, from state government
or consumer resistance to a range of variation in rates satisfactory
to the banks.
In February, respondents' willingness to make most other types
of loans was about unchanged from November. As in November, a sub-
stantial minority of banks indicated an increased willingness to lend
only in the case of participation loans originated by correspondent
banks.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The exchange value of the dollar has fluctuated widely since
the last Greenbook, and on balance the dollar's weighted-average
value has climbed by 2-3/4 percent. This is illustrated in the top
panel of the chart on the following page. Against individual foreign
currencies the dollar's performance in the past eight weeks has been
mixed. Against the German mark the dollar has appreciated by 3/4
percent on balance, while against the Swiss and French francs and
the Japanese yen the dollar has risen by 2 to 3 percent. Its appre-
ciation against the pound sterling exceeded 6 percent during the same
period.
From late January through about mid-February the dollar's
weighted-average value climbed by about 6 percentage points, almost
attaining 100 on the March 1973 base of this index. Major factors
in this appreciation were favorable exchange-market perceptions of
U.S. oil decontrol -- announced in late January -- and reactions
to fiscal policy initiatives of the new U.S. administration. Periodic
reaffirmations of U.S. monetary policy intentions, continuing tensions
in the Polish situation, expectations of an MLR cut in the United
Kingdom and mounting concern about the German mark likewise played
roles in the dollar's buoyancy.
Since mid-February the dollar has tended to ease back somewhat,
in line with the narrowing differential between interest-rates on
dollar assets and foreign rates depicted in the bottom panel of the
chart. Key U.S. money market rates have drifted down, while at the

same time foreign interest rates have risen. On February 19 the
Bundesbank's Central Council suspended its regular Lombard facility
(for the first time since 1973), substituting instead a special,
overnight Lombard window. This window has generally remained open
since late February, but at a rate of 12 percent, or 3 percentage
points higher than charges on the old facility. German interbank
rates have moved up correspondingly. The dollar gradually gave up
its earlier gains against the German mark following the Bundesbank's
actions. Decreases in the Bank of England's MLR and in the Japanese
discount rate had been widely anticipated, and exchange markets have
shown little reaction to these initiatives. (See discussion on
foreign economic developments, below, for details on these and other
monetary policy actions.)
Gold prices fell from an initial level around $525 at the time
of the last Greenbook to as low as $460 in early March, but subsequently
have climbed again to around $530. This recent upward move is reported
to be mostly in response to declines in dollar interest rates and
heightened Polish tensions.
During the past several weeks the Italian lira has been par-
ticularly weak within the EMS arrangement, reflecting concerns about
Italy's large external deficit and high inflation rate. On March 22
the central rate of the lira was formally devalued by 6 percent
against the other EMS currencies, bringing its existing market rate
to about 1 percent above its new central rate with the German mark.
(Unlike the currencies in the narrow-margins agreement, the lira is
permitted a 6 percent range of fluctuation against other EMS

IV-4
currencies.) The Bank of Italy also increased its discount rate
and increased banks' reserve requirements. Nonetheless, since the
weekend the lira has been subjected to further downward pressure,
and it has depreciated to about 1/2 percent below its new central
rate with the mark.
The extended period of weakness exhibited by the German mark
within the EMS narrow margins arrangement came to an end in late
February with the sudden rise in German interest rates. In fact, the
mark has moved to the top of the narrow band and is presently slightly
above the French franc and almost 2-1/4 percent (the maximum allowable)
above the Belgian franc.
The magnitude of U.S. intervention has declined sharply during
the period, and for the last several weeks the Desk has essentially
been out of the mark. However, for the whole period since the last
Greenbook, the Desk purchased $1.2 billion equivalent of foreign

IV-5
currencies, virtually all in German marks, but also including $20
million equivalent of Swiss francs. All the Desk acquisitions were
shared equally between the System and Treasury. In addition, during
February the System made several small investments of Swiss franc
holdings in Swiss government money market certificates.
As of yesterday afternoon, the System's open position in foreign
currencies remained at $3.2 billion equivalent, with unrealized losses
on this position coming to $112.0 million.

IV-6
Foreign lending by U.S. banks. Claims on foreigners held by the
domestic offices and foreign branches of U.S.-chartered banks increased
by somewhat less in the second half of 1980 than in the period a year
earlier, following a sharp pickup in such foreign lending in the first
half of the year. However, the slowing in the second half mainly involved
lending to the industrial countries. Lending to the non-OPEC developing
countries, by contrast, continued to increase strongly. For 1980 as a
whole, lending both to that group and to the industrial countries was
substantially greater than in 1979. (See table.)
Total claims on foreigners rose $24 billion in the second half of
1980, about $4 billion less than in the comparable period of 1979.
(Because of seasonality in the data the most appropriate comparisons are
between corresponding periods of each year.) In 1980 lending to most G-10
countries, which is largely interbank placements, slackened. Among the
smaller industrial countries, lending to Spain declined sharply from a year
earlier, and there was no further lending to Denmark. For South Africa
repayments again exceeded new loans; outstanding claims on South Africa
have fallen by $1.3 billion in the three years 1978-80, to $1.1 billion
outstanding in December 1980.
Because lending to industrial countries had been very buoyant in
the first half of the year, for the full year 1980 lending to both the
G-10 and the smaller countries was substantially greater than the year
before. Among the smaller industrial countries the principal increase
was to Spain, on which claims rose $0.5 billion last year after no rise
in 1979. With respect to other areas, lending to the OPEC countries,
which had already fallen to a low level in 1979, became slightly negative

in 1980 as a whole (despite some rise in the second half). Although
claims on Venezuela, Ecuador, and the African oil-exporting countries each
increased $0.2-0.4 billion last year, these increases were offset by decreases
in claims on Middle East oil exporters. Lending to Eastern Europe of
$0.2 billion in 1980 was one-half of the 1979 figure. In this group,
claims on Poland rose $60 million (compared with $220 million in 1979),
and amounted to $1.74 billion at year-end.
U.S. bank lending to the non-OPEC developing countries came to
$9.5 billion in the second half of 1980 and $14 billion in 1980 as a whole.
Both these amounts were nearly 40 percent greater than the comparable 1979
amounts, and the full-year figure represented more than a doubling of the
1976-78 average annual volume. Lending to Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and
Taiwan increased sharply, both in the second half and in the full year.
Lending to Korea halted in the second half, and therefore showed no full-
year increase despite the surge in the first half. The only major borrower
in this group to which lending dropped off for the year as a whole was the
Philippines. Although lending to Brazil rose sharply in the second half of
1980, for the year it was much below its 1976-78 annual average and was
greatly exceeded by lehding to Mexico, Argentina (now the third largest
debtor to U.S. banks among non-OPEC developing countries) and Korea.
The U.S. banks' willingness to step up their lending to the non-OPEC
developing countries contrasts with the actions of non-U.S. banks. BIS
statistics indicate that lending to these countries by non-U.S. banks in
the first three quarters of 1980 amounted to about $15-1/2 billion, down
15 percent from $18-1/2 billion a year earlier.

IV-9
The forms of bank lending to developing countries changed during
1980. For U.S. and non-U.S. bank lending taken together, lending to the
non-OPEC developing countries in the form of syndicated medium-term
Eurocredits declined more than 30 percent last year, while other forms
of lending increased.

U.S. International Transactions
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit increased in January to $35
billion annual rate on an international accounts basis. Monthly trade
deficits, which have risen steadily since last summer, increased signi-
ficantly between October 1980 and January 1981 as the value of imports
rose sharply. The strength of imports in those months largely reflected
the pick-up in U.S. economic activity -- 4 percent real GNP growth was
recorded in 4Q80. During the same months the value of exports, other
than agricultural commodities, pretty much leveled off and the volume
shipped fell continuing declines begun when foreign economic activity
fell during the spring and summer.

The merchandise trade data used in the International Transactions account
are virtually the same as the trade data used in the GNP account. The only
difference is that gold transactions are excluded from GNP data but are in-
cluded in International Transactions data. In 1980 gold exports amounted to
$4.0 billion, and gold imports excluded from GNP data amounted to $3.9 billion.

The volume of oil imports rose 10 percent between October 1980
and January 1981 primarily as a result of rising U.S. economic activity.
In addition, the U.S. Government began to add to the Strategic Petroleum
Reserves during these months after a 15 month hiatus. The decline of
private stocks (particularly refined products) that occurred during the
latter part of 1980 appears to have halted in early 1981. Prices of
imported oil increased 6 percent between October and January; the rises
through January reflect only part of the OPEC price rise announced at
year-end.

The increase in nonoil imports, while spread fairly widely among
commodity categories, was strongest for industrial supplies and consumer
goods. Automotive imports from Japan and Europe also increased notably
in January, more than reversing the sharp December downturn. Foreign
car sales continued at about the fourth-quarter rate through January but
rose sharply in February. Dealer inventories of new cars began to be
drawn down in January.
Virtually all of the increase in exports from October to January
was in agricultural exports, particularly wheat and soybeans. Agricultural
export prices in January increased only modestly from December levels,
despite a drop in commodity futures prices that began in November. Non-
agricultural exports were about the same level in January as in October

IV -12
with declines in the intervening months; this pattern was followed by
both industrial supplies and machinery exports (which together account
for two-thirds of U.S. nonagricultural exports). In January the value of
civilian aircraft exports fell sharply.
NOTE: Beginning with the January 1981 data, the Department of Commerce
is including the foreign trade of the U.S. Virgin Islands, a major oil-
refining center, in its monthly trade press release (Census basis data).
This change does not affect trade data on an international accounts basis
or in the GNP account since such transactions have always been included
there.
Bank-reported capital flows. During January and February U.S. non-
bank residents obtained a large amount of credit from offshore banks. As
shown in the chart below, outstanding credit extended directly to residents
by branches of U.S. banks increased about $2.5 billion during that period
(a further increase of $0.5 billion was recorded in early March). In
addition, Ford Motor Co. borrowed more than $1.2 billion from banks in
West Germany and the United Kingdom through its subsidiaries in those
countries. This growth in credit from abroad is a significant offset to
the weakness in business loans of domestic banking offices since the
beginning of the year. See the "Domestic Financial Developments" section
of the Greenbook for a discussion of impact of such activity on measures
of bank credit.
The surge in branch loans appears to reflect the spread of alter-
natives to prime-based pricing of business loans. Surveys of terms of
lending at domestic offices of 48 large banks reveal that the percentage
of gross loan extensions made at rates below prime increased from about
20 percent in November to 70 percent in February, a period during which
market rates fell below prime. One alternative to prime-based pricing is

Data on credit extended to U.S. nonbank residents by offshore

pricing based on the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR). Many large corpora-
tions have the option of borrowing at a LIBOR-based rate rather than prime.
The chart above indicates that in late December LIBOR fell below prime.
Since the beginning of the year the differential has averaged about 170
basis points. Prime-based loans are generally booked at domestic offices.
LIBOR-based loans, on the other hand, can be booked either onshore or
offshore. Tax practices in certain states, however, provide strong
incentives to book loans at offshore shell branches. In New York if a
loan is booked at a shell branch rather than the head office, a con-
siderable portion of the income on the loan is not subject to New York
State taxation. To a lesser extent tax practices in California and
Illinois also provide incentives for banks to book loans offshore.
Banks headquartered in these three states accounted for nearly all of the
surge in branch loans.
It does not appear that the surge in loans to U.S. residents from
offshore branches of U.S. banks can be accounted for by the change in
the Eurocurrency reserve requirement which was implemented in December
1980. The change allowed U.S. banks to net advances to their own
foreign branches against branch loans to U.S. residents and sales of
assets to branches in computing required reserves on Eurocurrency
liabilities. If the reserve requirement had effectively discouraged
branch loans to residents, allowing this type of netting could have been
expected to result in an increase in such loans, accompanied by an
increase in net advances to branches. This has not been the case. In
fact, the bulk of the increase in such loans was reported by banks which
did not report increases in net advances to their own foreign branches.

IV -15
Holdings of official reserve assets in the United States by the
G-10 countries and Switzerland increased about $1.5 billion in January.
Partial data, based on holdings at the FRBNY, indicate an additional
inflow of about $1.7 billion in February.
OPEC reserve holdings in the United States decreased by $0,2
billion in January.
.In February, OPEC holdings at the FRBNY rose $2.6
billion as one OPEC country purchased $3.0 billion in Treasury notes
and bills.
U.S. official reserve assets increased by a total of about $2.9
billion in January and February, chiefly as a result of intervention
purchases of German marks.

U.S. current account. Last week the Commerce Department released
current-account data for the fourth quarter and year 1980. The U.S.
current account was in surplus by $2.7 billion at an annual rate in 4Q80,
which was considerably smaller than the third-quarter surplus. Most of
the quarter-to-quarter change resulted from an increase in the trade
deficit. Partly offsetting the decline in trade was an increase in net
investment income receipts. This net increase was a result of reduced
payments to foreigners; receipts from abroad declined, largely reflect-
ing lower petroleum profits.

Economic activity remains weak in the major European countries and
to some extent in Japan. Industrial production fell in December and
January in the United Kingdom and Italy and, on balance, in Germany and
France. This followed fourth quarter declines in real GNP in those countries
(except Italy, where data are not yet available). Real GNP data for Japan
show a decrease in the growth rate in the fourth quarter to about 2 percent
(s.a.a.r.). In contrast, real growth for the same period in Canada
recovered sharply to 8 percent (s.a.a.r.).
The rate of price inflation in recent months in Japan remained
moderate while, except for the January/February WPI data, inflation has
been declining in the United Kingdom since mid-1980. In the other major
foreign countries inflation in the past two months remained high (Canada
and Italy) or even rose further (Germany, France and Switzerland).
The current account moved into surplus in Canada in the fourth
quarter of 1980 and remained in substantial surplus in the United Kingdom
in January-February. The trade deficits of France and Italy declined in
recent months. In sharp contrast, the traditional German trade surplus
virtually disappeared in January and the German current-account deficit
was exceptionally large at $2.5 billion. The Japanese current-account
deficit increased somewhat in February, but is still quite low relative
to levels reached in the first half of 1980.
Several of the major foreign industrial countries recently announced
policy changes. In Japan authorities announced a decrease in the discount
rate and other measures to expand domestic demand. Elsewhere policy moves
were generally restricitive. In the United Kingdom and Canada the policy
actions included new lower targets for the growth of money. Italian

authorities raised the discount rate and increased reserve requirements
on incremental deposits. In Germany the Lombard rate was effectively
raised by closing the normal Lombard facility and opening a new special
facility. In addition central bank rates were increased in France, the
Netherlands, Belgium (twice) and Switzerland (twice) during February
and March.
In Japan recently-released GNP statistics confirm that real growth
slowed significantly in the fourth quarter to only 2 percent (s.a.a.r.),
due in large part to continued softness in private consumption expenditure.
Private fixed investment and real exports remained relatively brisk,
although growing resistance in Japan's overseas markets contributed to
slower export expansion than earlier in 1980. Downward adjustments of
inventory levels appear to be taking longer than expected.
In the face of this sluggishness in demand, as well as a continued
easing of price pressures, the Japanese authorities in early March
announced a package of measures designed to stimulate the economy --
including a one percentage point cut in the discount rate to 6.25 percent
and reductions in reserve requirements. The package also includes an
acceleration of public-works expenditure, measures to promote housing,
and special favorable financing for industrial plant exports.

February Japan! Jiy u jin, XX Century
Prices have continued the moderating trend seen in recent months.
In February, the Japanese WPI fell by 0.2 percent, and consumer prices
moved upward in line with the 5-6 percent annual rate of increase of

IV -23
recent quarters.
The current-account deficit widened slightly in February to
$400 million (s.a.) following a small deficit of $30 million in January.
Export growth was offset primarily by a deterioration of the services
and transfers account to a record $1-1.2 billion deficit. The latter
reflects, in large part, interest payments on the swelling stock of
Japanese liabilities held abroad.
On March 10 the U.K. government presented its budget for the fiscal
year beginning in April. Selected excise taxes were raised substantially;
a one-time special tax on banks' non-interest-bearing deposit liabilities
was imposed (a kind of windfall-profits tax); and the personal income
tax schedule was deliberately not adjusted for inflation (by virtue of
action by Parliament overriding existing law). Real government spending
will be essentially unchanged in FY1981-82 from FY1980-81 levels, and the
public sector borrowing requirement is forecast to decrease by £ 3 billion
to £ 10.5 billion (4-1/4 percent of GDP). The Bank of England's Minimum
Lending Rate was lowered from 14 to 12 percent and a new target for
sterling M3 of 6-10 percent annual growth from February 1981 to April 1982
was set. The previous target was 7-11 percent for 1980-81 but was
substantially exceeded.
Real activity in the United Kingdom continues to fall, but there
are some preliminary indications from data on employment vacancies that
decline may be nearing its end. Based on preliminary data, real GNP
declined 1 percent (s.a.) in the fourth quarter of 1980 while the
unemployment rate rose from 8.8 in December to 9.9 in March. The U.K.
inflation rate has fallen substantially during the recession. In the

IV -24
six months to February 1981 consumer prices increased only 8.5 percent
(a.r.) in contrast to the 23 percent (a.r.) increase in the 6-month
period ending June 1980. However, so far this year, both CPI and WPI
have been accelerating somewhat. The current account continues to reflect
the reduced level of domestic activity. In the first two months of the
year the surplus was nearly $4 Billion.
The pace of economic activity in Germany remains low. The seasonally
adjusted rate of unemployment in February was 4.6 percent, compared with
a year-earlier rate of 3.6 percent. The overall order volume rose slightly
in January, due to a 6.5 percent increase in orders from abroad.
Consumer price inflation accelerated in the first two months of
this year to an annual rate of 9 percent, compared with 5.5 percent
annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year. As the annual wage
negotiations are moving closer to their (mostly April) deadlines, only
one major industry has settled. This settlement, a contract for construction
workers with a 4 percent wage increase, is not considered pace-setting
because of above average unemployment in that industry. Negotiations
with the key metal workers' union are deadlocked and warning strikes by
120,000 workers in several Volkswagen plants have taken place.
The current account recorded another large deficit in January. At
$2.5 billion, this is among the largest monthly deficits on record. The
January trade balance also showed a deficit, $0.5 billion (equivalent to
$0.1 billion s.a.).
In a major move to stop the depreciation of the D-mark, the
Bundesbank closed its regular Lombard credit facility and eliminated the
last remaining controls on capital imports on February 19. Lombard credit

IV -25
has been available only overnight under a special Lombard facility.
This facility was opened and closed several times in late February,
resulting in considerable fluctuation of money market rates, but has
remained open since March 31; the call money rate has remained close
to the special Lombard rate of 12 percent. Prior to February 19, the
Lombard rate had been 9 percent.
In Canada, real GNP rose 8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth
quarter. This increase was primarily the result of a sharp rise in real
merchandise exports of almost 9 percent. In February the unemployment
rate fell to 7.2 percent from 7.3 percent in January. This is the lowest
rate since December 1979 and represents the second consecutive monthly
decline.
Consumer price inflation for the three-month period ending in
February was almost 12 percent (a.r.) slightly higher than the rate for
three months.
In the fourth quarter of 1980, the current account rose by $520
million to a surplus of $410 million. This sharp swing into surplus was
primarily the result of a 10 percent increase in the value of exports
which outpaced a 6.5 percent rise in imports.
On February 13, the Bank of Canada announced a reduction in its
target range for M1 growth from 5-9 to 4-8 percent; the new base is the
average level of M1 for three months centered on September 1980. On
March 1, the Province of Alberta put into effect the first stage of oil
production cutbacks in response to the Trudeau Government's National
Energy Program a program which raises federal taxes on oil revenues
and retards the rate at which domestic oil prices are allowed to reach

IV -26
world market prices.
French real GNP declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 1980.
Consumer prices rose over 13 percent in 1980 (December to December) and
accelerated from a year-end slowdown to about the same rate in January.
Wholesale price inflation increased to over 13 percent in the last
quarter of 1980 and first month of 1981. The continued rapid pace of
price increase is due to previous oil price rises and associated administered
price increases. The trade deficit in the three months ending February
was $2.9 billion, a decrease from the $3.6 billion rate of the previous
three months.
French M2 growth from December 1979 to December 1980 was 9.6 percent,
below the target (upper limit) of 11 percent set for that year. The target
has been lowered to 10 percent for this year. The French raised their
money market intervention rate from 10.75 to 12 percent in several steps
the last ten days of February in response, at least in part, to interest
rate increases in other countries.
In Italy industrial production, which has oscillated sharply since
last spring, fell in December-January. Despite the latest two month's
data, an end to the decline in real activity is suggested by the most
recent business surveys, which indicate a less pessimistic outlook. The
inflation rate has shown little sign of abating; consumer prices rose
1.9 percent in January, following a quarterly rent adjustment and a large
jump in electricity and fuel prices, and a further 1.8 percent in February.
The trade deficit narrowed in November-January to a monthly average of
$1.4 billion, compared with a monthly average deficit of $3 billion in
July-October.

In early February the Bank of Italy announced measures to tighten
the limits on the expansion of bank credit by ending the exemption for
small loans and foreign currency lendings. On March 22, in conjunction
with the lira's devaluation in the EMS, the Italian authorities raised
the discount rate from 16.5 to 19 percent and increased reserve requirements
on incremental deposits from 15.75 to 20 percent. These measures were
taken because of the persistance of high inflation and weakness of the
lira.
In Switzerland inflation accelerated sharply in January and February.
The consumer price index rose at an average annual rate of 12 percent
in those two months, thereby raising the year-over-year inflation rate
to 6 percent for February. In response to the higher domestic inflation
and to higher interest rates abroad, the Swiss National Bank raised
its discount rate to 3.5 percent on February 3 and to 4.0 percent on
February 19.
