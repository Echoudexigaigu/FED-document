Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity continued to grow in April, although at a slower
pace than prevailed at the turn of the year. Industrial production
apparently posted another gain but nonfarm payroll employment declined.
On balance, consumer spending for goods fell in April, as an increase in
outlays on nonauto items was more than offset by a sharp drop in auto
sales following the termination of rebates. Housing starts remained at
a low level in March, but business investment spending showed considerable
strength in the first quarter. Inflation moderated in recent months with
a weakening in prices of gasoline, food, and housing; but pressures from
rising labor costs continued to be strong.
Industrial Production and Employment
Industrial production tentatively is estimated to have risen about
1/2 percent in April, following a similar gain in March. Auto assemblies
led the April advance, rising almost 5 percent but only to an annual rate
of 6.8 million units. Assemblies are scheduled to rise further in May,
but these plans may be scaled back unless sales pick up soon. The walk-
out of union miners that began March 27 cut coal production in half; this
had the effect of damping the overall production index by about 0.3
percent. Raw steel production also declined slightly, while output of
other industries including equipment increased further. Production
gains raised capacity utilization for manufacturing somewhat in April.
A small rise in manufacturing employment accompanied the increase
in industrial production in April. Total nonfarm payroll employment,
however, was down about 45,000 from March after adjusting for workers
on strike; since January hiring has tapered off steadily. Employment

continued to rise in the service industries, but there was a sizable drop
in employment at retail trade establishments, where seasonal hiring for
Easter was less than usual. The number of construction jobs also fell
again in April, bringing the cumulative job decline in this sector since
January to nearly 200,000. The gains in manufacturing employment were
concentrated in durable goods industries. The factory workweek also
edged up--returning to the level prevailing at the end of 1980. Despite
substantial rehiring over the past 9 months, employment in manufacturing
is still well below the pre-recession peak in mid-1979.
As in March, the April survey of households showed large increases
in both employment and the labor force, leaving the overall unemployment
rate unchanged at 7.3 percent--about where it has been since December.
The two employment measures often have shown disparate monthly movements,
but they have tended to track together over the longer term. The recovery
in household employment lagged behind that reported in the payroll survey
during the second half of 1980; the recent large increases in household
employment have narrowed the gap considerably.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Personal income growth tapered off in recent months and was barely
sufficient to keep ahead of inflation. Income rose 9-1/4 percent (annual
rate) from January to March versus 13-1/2 percent between last September
and January. Much of the slowdown reflected smaller increases in wages
and salaries in commodity-producing industries as employment gains
dwindled. Meanwhile, farm proprietors' income fell through March as
a result of declines in livestock and crop prices coupled with higher
production costs. Real disposable personal income grew at about a 2-1/2

percent annual rate for the first quarter as a whole, but the level was
still only fractionally above its previous peak in January 1980.
Growth in consumer spending on goods was strong in the first quarter.
In April, however, total retail sales declined 1 percent. The weak over-
all sales figures reflected mainly a sharp drop in unit auto sales.
Excluding automobiles and nonconsumption items, nominal sales advanced 1
percent in April, after posting a similar gain in March. In April, sales
at the GAF grouping and at gasoline and food stores registered sizable
gains. This sales performance was consistent with an improvement in
consumer confidence according to both the Michigan and Conference Board
surveys. After drifting downward since November, the composite sentiment
measures from these surveys rose in April to values close to those
reported last fall.
Auto sales were off sharply throughout April from their March levels.
Total unit purchases dropped to an 8.1 million annual rate--the slowest
sales pace since June 1980 when credit controls were still in effect;
sales of domestic units were at a 5.8 million unit annual rate. A fall
in sales of domestically-produced automobiles was expected following the
end of rebates that boosted sales in February and March. The slump in
sales during April along with higher production rates resulted in a rise
in the stock of unsold cars. Domestic auto stocks at the end of April
increased to 1.25 million units, a very low level historically, but
equivalent to a substantial 65 days supply at the low April sales rate.
Purchases of imported cars declined in April to a 2.3 million unit annual
rate from 2.6 million in March.

Inventory Investment
Business continued to follow lean inventory policies throughout the
first quarter and, relative to sales, stocks remained close to average
historical levels. The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories
rose rapidly early in the year, with increases averaging about $50 billion
at an annual rate in January and February. In real terms, though, there
was no buildup in stocks except for crude oil and petroleum products.
Prompt adjustments in production schedules occurred in response to
sluggish sales and prevented the development of major imbalances; by the
end of March, inventory accumulation in book-value terms had slowed, and
real stocks apparently declined further.
In the manufacturing sector, the book-value of stocks rose at a $25
billion annual rate in March, following increases of $47 billion and $34
billion in the preceding two months. Nearly four-fifths of the March
accumulation occurred in the nondurable goods category, including an $11
billion buildup in stocks of petroleum products that partly reflected
price increases. Physical stocks of both crude oil and petroleum products
have been well above average since January. In the durable goods category,
several of the industries that reported substantial accumulations in
January and February showed only small or no book-value increases in
March. Moreover, the book value of stocks at merchant wholesalers de-
clined at a $10 billion rate in March and showed a liquidation for the
first quarter as a whole.
Business Fixed Investment
Capital spending grew briskly in the first quarter. Real shipments
of nondefense capital goods are estimated to have increased more than 4

percent, and truck sales--while sluggish--rose somewhat from the
depressed fourth-quarter rate. In the nonresidential structures area,
real construction outlays surged in January and remained at a high level
through March.
Commitments for capital spending suggest some further near-term
advance. Constant-dollar orders for nondefense capital goods rose 12.4
percent in March and 4.3 percent for the first quarter as a whole.
Despite this surge in new commitments, shipments growth may slow in the
coming months because the backlog of unfilled orders for nondefense capital
goods has been fairly low relative to deliveries. Contracts for nonresi-
dential plant rose in February and March, following a sharp decline in
January, and for the quarter as a whole these contracts were off about
25 percent.
As for longer term investment indicators, the spring McGraw-Hill
survey reported that businesses are planning to increase nominal plant
and equipment spending 12 percent in 1981. The planned rise in nominal
outlays is about the same as indicated in the fall report, but the
industry composition is considerably different. Basic durable goods
manufacturing industries such as iron and steel and motor vehicles have
boosted their plans while nondurable goods producers have scaled back
their ambitious capital spending programs of last autumn. In comparison
to the McGraw Hill 12 percent, the February Commerce Department survey
reported a 10.2 percent rise and the Merrill Lynch survey a 10 percent
increase. Given the high level of spending so far this year and the
outlook for BFI prices, the survey results suggest little additional
gains in real outlays through the end of the year.

Residential Construction
Housing activity has weakened further in recent months in response
to stringent financial conditions. In February and March, housing starts
for both single- and multi-family units were well below their levels of
1980-Q4 when total starts averaged about 1.5 million units. In contrast
to the reduced level of starts, the total value of residential construc-
tion put-in-place during the first quarter rose 5 percent from the pre-
ceding quarter, reflecting work on the relatively large number of units
started in the second half of last year.
Weakness in the housing sector also showed up in home sales. Sales
of new houses remained just above the 500,000 unit annual rate mark in
March--almost 20 percent below last summer's peak. Builders have managed
to keep inventory positions lean; the number of new houses unsold at the
end of March was the lowest since the spring of 1976. Demand for existing
homes also has fallen, with sales in the first quarter down 15 percent
from the final quarter of last year.
Th slowing of activity in real estate markets has been accompanied
by a general deceleration in the rise of house prices. The average price
of existing homes sold in the first quarter was 10 percent higher than
a year earlier, compared with 14 percent increase over the preceding
year; part of the slowdown in this measure of house prices may be attri-
butable to a downgrading in the type of units sold. The slowing has
been widespread regionally, with the exception of the South where both
sales volume and price increases have been relatively well maintained.
Increases in new-house prices measured by the quality-adjusted Census
Bureau index, while quite volatile in the last few quarters, also have

shown a trend toward deceleration on a year-over-year basis. Some of
the recent variability in this measure of house prices may reflect the
increased use of nontraditional financing techniques, which can affect
contracted sales prices.
Government Sector
On a NIPA basis, federal purchases of goods and services rose $7.6
billion (in current dollars) in the first quarter, which represented a
rise in real terms of 12.5 percent at an annual rate. The increase
included an unusually large rise of $5 billion in CCC acquisitions.
Normally, a seasonal reduction in CCC loans occurs in the first quarter,
but this year farmers apparently delayed loan repayments until April.
In contrast, increases in defense purchases at $3.3 billion in the first
quarter slowed relative to the average $5.7 billion quarterly pace
observed in 1980. The slower growth in defense purchases appears to be
transitory. In March, for example, manufacturers' shipments of defense
goods exceeded the November level after a two-month decline and unfilled
orders continued to rise through March. Moreover, recent OMB projections
call for further increases in defense purchases to a rate of $5.9 billion
per quarter over the next 6 quarters, or about a 16 percent nominal
increase at an annual rate.
The unified budget deficit edged down slightly in the first quarter
to $32.1 billion (not seasonally adjusted) from $33.6 billion in the
preceding quarter even though tax collections fell slightly behind expec-
tations. In April, receipts of individual nonwithheld income taxes
accelerated relative to a year earlier especially in the April 15-28
period. Total refund payments also accelerated in this period.

Indicators of state and local government spending have been mixed
in recent months. The real value of new construction put-in-place
rose substantially during the first quarter due to a spurt in spending
on road projects. Nevertheless, construction outlays were down 2 percent
in real terms from a year ago. Meanwhile, the sector's payroll employ-
ment has shown no growth this year. State and local governments apparently
have been hiring at a rate just sufficient to replace losses in federally-
funded jobs as the administration winds down the CETA public service
employment program.
Prices and Labor Costs
Recent price developments have signaled a slowing of inflation in
a number of markets. Gasoline prices reportedly have edged down in
recent weeks; house price increases have weakened, and some measures
even show a decline; and consumer food price advances have continued to
be relatively moderate. However, American automakers have announced
new price increases, and spot prices for crude foodstuffs turned up in
April. Moreover, underlying labor cost pressures remain quite strong.
The upsurge in energy prices early in the year now has abated,
although the indirect effects of those increases are still percolating
through the economy. Consumer energy prices rose 2 percent in March,
far less than in February when the main impact of oil decontrol hit.
Most of the March increase probably occurred early in the month;
industry sources report that gasoline prices have edged lower over the
last six weeks. Crude oil prices also have been reduced by some oil-
exporting countries in light of sluggish demands and high inventories.
Nevertheless, the prices of energy-intensive products such as industrial

chemicals, asphalt roofing, and synthetic fibers were still rising
rapidly in the April PPI.
The decline in the CPI measure of house prices has been especially
striking. These prices have declined for three consecutive months,
following increases of 16 percent in 1979 and 11-1/2 percent in 1980.
Because home purchase prices enter the CPI with a large weight, the
fall in house prices so far this year has reduced the CPI for all items
by about two percentage points at an annual rate.
The food sector is another area in which inflation rates have eased
early this year, but the price outlook for the balance of the year looks
less favorable. The moderation in food prices in the March CPI was more
broadly based than in either January or February, as inflation slowed
for a number of food items while meat prices declined for a third month
in a row. In addition, there have been some developments in the agri-
cultural sector favorable to the price outlook: sugar prices have
plummeted since last October; U.S. feed grain inventories are slightly
more plentiful than previously was thought; preliminary indications
are that the wheat crop will be large this year; and, spring rains
have replenished topsoil moisture in a number of agricultural regions.
Nonetheless, livestock prices turned up in the April PPI following
several months of declines, and underlying soil conditions still remain
dry across large portions of the country.
Making lasting inroads against inflation will require an easing of
price increases in markets other than those for food, energy, and
homeownership. So far, there are relatively few signs of such weakness.

A reconstructed CPI series that excludes volatile items such as food,
energy, homeownership, and used cars rose at about a 9-1/4 percent
annual rate in both February and March--about the same as during 1980
as a whole. Consumer prices for new cars declined in March, but re-
bounded at the producer level in April with the ending of rebates and
the announcement of further price hikes by U.S. manufacturers. In
addition, producer prices for capital equipment rose rapidly through April,
and prices for construction materials also increased substantially.
The continued rapid increase of prices other than food, energy, and
homeownership stems in part from the persistence of labor cost pressures.
Although wage rates, as measured by the often-volatile hourly earnings
index for nonfarm production workers, rose at only a 3 percent annual
rate in April, the 10 percent rate of increase in 1981-Q1 was slightly
more than in 1980. Because of the sizable hike in social security taxes
in January, the increase inhourly compensation in the first quarter--
at an 11.3 percent annual rate--was even larger than the rise in wage
rates in that period. Wage increases recently negotiated by major
collective bargaining units (those covering 1,000 workers or more) also
have shown no signs of moderation. Excluding potential wage gains under
cost-of-living clauses, wage increases negotiated in settlements reached
during the first quarter averaged 9.0 percent in the first year and 7.7
over the contract life, compared with 9.5 and 7.1 percent, respectively,
in 1980. The recent slowing of increases in the CPI, however, eventually
could trim the size of overall wage adjustments under major bargaining
agreements that have escalator provisions.

A strong rebound in productivity tempered the increase in nonfarm
unit labor costs to a 7-1/2 percent annual rate in the first quarter.
Yet, since the cyclical peak in 1980-Q1, productivity growth has con-
tributed little to slowing the trend rate of increase in unit labor
costs. Nonfarm productivity has risen just 1 percent, or slightly above
its post-1973 trend rate, and the cyclical recovery of productivity over
the last three quarters has been relatively weak in comparison to past
cycles. As a result, unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector
were 9-1/4 percent higher in 1981-Q1 than a year earlier.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The narrow monetary aggregates, adjusted to remove the effects of
shifts into NOW accounts, surged in April. The April strength likely re-
flected some realignment of cash balances with trends in income and
spending following a period of sluggish behavior; changes in patterns of
tax payments and refunds appear to have had little net effect on money
growth. Owing to the burst in M-1B growth, M-2 expansion remained quite
rapid in April even though growth of its nontransaction component
weakened considerably.
Open market operations did not accommodate the strong growth of money
through the provision of nonborrowed reserves, and borrowing at the dis-
count window increased substantially over the course of April. Pressures
on the federal funds rate and other money market rates intensified in early
May when the System increased both the basic discount rate and the surcharge.
Most short-term market rates have risen 3 to 5 percentage points since the
last FOMC meeting. Long-term bond rates generally have reached new highs
and on balance have advanced about one percentage point over the intermeet-
ing period. Rates on home mortgages in the primary market have continued
rising at a more gradual pace.
Despite higher bond rates and some decline in equity prices in the
latter part of the month, corporate bond and stock offerings remained
strong in April, while short-term business borrowing weakened. With the
federal budget shifting from a large deficit to a surplus, the Treasury's
demands on credit markets moderated last month. State and local govern-
ments, however, continued to borrow heavily. Residential mortgage flows
slackened in March--and may well have diminished further in April. In

contrast, consumer installment credit expanded in March at its strongest
pace since September 1979, reflecting in part the rebate-related boost in
car sales.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Adjusted for shifts into NOW accounts, M-1B expanded at an estima-
ted 14-1/4 percent annual rate in April, about double the pace of March.1
All components of M-1B strengthened in April. "Other checkable deposits"
rose $6-3/4 billion, after a $5-1/4 billion increase in March. Even so,
the contraction in demand deposits moderated considerably in April, and
growth of currency picked up to a 10-1/4 percent annual rate, well above
the first-quarter pace. Changes in the payment and processing of federal
income taxes appear to have had little effect on monetary expansion during
April. The Treasury's efficiency in processing tax payments reportedly has
improved, tending to speed debits to checking accounts and thus to lower
M-1B. This effect, however, seems to have been offset by increases in tax
refunds and in nonwithheld tax payments, which tended to raise M-lB.
Expansion in M-2 was restrained in April by a slowing in the growth
of the nontransaction component of this aggregate--to a 9-1/2 percent
annual rate, well below the March pace. Inflows to money market mutual
funds (MMMFs) tapered off, total savings and small time deposits were
flat, and overnight RPs declined.2
1. These figures are based on revised seasonal adjustment factors and
a new procedure that seasonally adjusts the other checkable deposits com-
ponent. Although the change in seasonal adjustment procedures raises
M-1B growth in the first quarter about 1-1/4 percentage points--to 1 per-
cent at an annual rate--first-quarter M-1B growth was still considerably
lower than would have been expected on the basis of historical relation-
ships among money, GNP, and interest rates.
2. The drop in overnight RPs resulted in part from a conversion of over-
night RPs to term contracts around the Easter weekend, when many firms
took either Friday or Monday as a holiday.

The slowdown in growth of MMMF shares reflected a moderation in the
second half of April in growth of assets at broker-dealer and general pur-
pose funds, and a contraction in the assets of institution-only funds
catering to large investors, many of whom have direct access to money mar-
kets and readily shift funds to and from MMMFs as relative returns change.
Yields on the MMMFs have lagged the upward movement in market rates,
despite the generally short average maturities of MMMF portfolios.
While outflows from savings deposits moderated in April, growth of
small time deposits decelerated to the slowest pace since last August.
Depository institutions, especially S&Ls, have experienced weak MMC flows
during a period when a record volume of money market certificates was ma-
turing and when the spread between rates on MMMF shares and those on MMCs
favored MMFs until very recently.

Growth in M-3 edged up in April to a 10 percent annual rate, as the
slowdown in M-2 was more than offset by sharply reduced runoffs of large
time deposits at commercial banks and an uptick in term RPs. Large time
deposits outstanding at S&Ls are estimated to have remained unchanged on

a month-average basis in April--as in March--with S&Ls apparently reluc-
tant to issue such deposits in an environment of slack mortgage demand,
rising interest rates, and investor concern about the financial strength
of the institutions.
Total bank credit grew at a 4 percent annual rate in April after
registering a slight decline in March. Investments were little changed
as an increase in U.S. government securities was about offset by a decline
in other investments. Business loans rose slightly, owing entirely to a
large increase in holdings of bankers acceptances. Growth in real estate
lending decelerated somewhat further in the month to a 7-1/2 percent
annual rate. Consumer loans at large weekly reporting banks declined on a
seasonally adjusted basis in April.
Banks acquired funds well in excess of their domestic needs in
April. As shown in the table below, commercial banks advanced about $4
billion, net, to their foreign branches, partly in response to yield rela-
tionships that continued to favor overseas investment of funds raised in
the United States.

Business Finance
Partial data suggest that total funds raised in domestic markets by
nonfinancial firms declined in April after falling off over the first
quarter. An apparent further diminution in short-term borrowing was only
partially offset by increased long-term financing, which reflected both a
seasonally adjusted pickup in already brisk equity sales and continued
strong issuance of notes and bonds.
Changing interest rate relationships likely accounted for the marked
shifts in the composition of short-term borrowing by businesses in April.
Bank lending to businesses was concentrated at large weekly reporters,
whose business loans--excluding holdings of bankers acceptances--grew at a
10 percent annual rate after declining substantially in February and March.
A narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and commercial paper
rates--and the day to day volatility of paper rates--encouraged firms to
tap their bank lines. Outstanding nonfinancial paper declined about $500
million in April.
The gain in business loans at large banks may also have reflected
in part a drop in loans at U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks,
whose loan terms reportedly are more responsive than those of domestic
banks to market rates. In addition, a runup in Eurodollar rates relative
to the prime probably contributed to the slowing in the shifting of busi-
ness loans to foreign branches of U.S. banks. Monthly increases in off-
shore branch loans to U.S. nonbank residents--typically priced off LIBOR--
moderated from $1.2 billion on average in February and March to $500 mil-
lion in April.1
1. The appendix discusses the pricing and booking of business loans.

III-10
Although long-term yields climbed to record levels, the volume of
publicly-offered corporate bonds in April, at $3.5 billion (seasonally ad-
justed), was a bit above the strong pace in the first quarter, and consid-
erably above the volume in December, when yields reached their previous
highs. Some firms with continuing heavy needs for long-term capital have
decided to come to market at regular intervals in order to avoid concen-
trated borrowing at unfavorable rates in a volatile rate environment. How-
ever, the postponement of about $2-1/2 billion of offerings originally
announced for April suggests that many issuers are deferring bond issuance
in the hope that long-term rates will drop; indeed, new issue volume appears
to have weakened early in May following the most recent jump in interest
rates.
Efforts to hold down borrowing costs are evident in the offering
terms of many new issues. For example, the volume of convertible deben-
tures has expanded considerably over the past year, and the average matur-
ity of straight-debt offerings by nonfinancial businesses has decreased
substantially. More recently, investment-grade firms have marketed a
number of deep discount bonds, whose coupon rates were significantly below
market yields. In March and April ten deep discount bonds were sold;
these issues had par values totaling $2.3 billion, but gross proceeds
were only about half that amount. Given the tax advantage to the issuer
and the premium that investors are willing to pay for these bonds, the
deep discount bonds offered so far appear to have reduced borrowing costs
by roughly 1-1/2 percentage points.
Stock prices have been mixed over the intermeeting period. In mid-
April, many indexes established 8-year highs, from which they retreated

III-11
sharply in response to the runup in interest rates. With prices generally
high, the volume of new equity offerings was strong in April, rising to
$2.9 billion (seasonally adjusted). So far in 1981, gross stock issuance
has averaged more than $2 billion per month, exceeding last year's record
pace; initial public offerings are up significantly along with offerings
by seasoned issuers.
Government Finance
The Board staff projects a combined unified budget and off-budget
agency surplus of about $11-1/2 billion this quarter; however, facing
substantial cash needs later this year, the Treasury likely will reduce
its marketable debt by only $3 billion. The bulk of an $18 billion bill
redemption is expected to be offset by sales of new coupon securities.
As a part of this program, the Treasury ran off $9-1/2 billion in
bills in April and raised $6 billion in coupon issues. In early May, the
Treasury raised $2.1 billion in its mid-quarter refunding, which was a
typical 3-part package including $3 billion of 2-year notes, $1-3/4 billion
of 10-year notes, and $2 billion of 30-year bonds; these securities were
auctioned at record yields that attracted a large volume of noncompetitive
tenders.
The large run-off of bills in April was accompanied by significant
moderation in demand for Treasury bills by foreign central banks and by
sharp reductions in dealer holdings of bills from about $14 billion at
the end of March to about $3 billion one month later. This huge reduc-
tion in dealer inventories, which extended to Treasury coupons and agency
and private short-term issues, appears for several reasons to reflect a

reassessment of expectations of declines in short-term interest rates. For
one, it occurred even though dealer financing rates increased in April
only moderately more than bill rates. Moreover, the reduction in dealer
holdings outpaced sizable declines in short positions in futures contracts,
thereby virtually eliminating the large net long positions that dealers
had built up over the first quarter.
Borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies is estimated at
$2.7 billion in April, with the Federal Farm Credit Banks raising $1.7
billion. The Federal Home Loan Banks borrowed $1.5 billion, about triple
the March volume, and used the proceeds, along with a reduction in System
liquidity, to finance $2.2 billion of advances to thrifts. The Federal
National Mortgage Association ran off an additional $500 million of debt
in April, reflecting continued weakness in its net mortgage purchases.
Despite record high yields, state and local governments boosted
their gross issuance of long-term debt in April to a seasonally adjusted
$4-3/4 billion from the $3-1/4 billion monthly average of the first
quarter. The April increase is partly attributable to the limited ability
of municipal utilities to delay offerings, given the usual rigidity of
their large annual funding requirements and construction payment schedules;
utility bonds accounted for an above-normal proportion of total issues
in April. Pressing cash needs also appear to have accounted for a portion
of the large volume of nonutility issues, which included $500 million of
previously postponed offerings.
Although municipal volume in April may also indicate that many is-
suers did not expect yields to decline soon, some issuers apparently
awaited a decline. During April, 18 issuers postponed more than $750

Mortgage Markets
Preliminary estimates indicate a sharp first quarter drop in net
mortgage lending, especially residential mortgages. This slowing was
most evident at depository institutions. Field reports suggest that
mortgage originations picked up less than seasonally in April. Signs
of continued slack include a further cutback in issuance of GNMA-guaran-
teed securities and reports of additional closings of offices by mort-
gage companies.
In March, net mortgage acquisitions at S&Ls dropped to less than
half their autumn high, and new commitments remained at their low Febru-
ary level. This curtailment of mortgage activity may in part reflect an

effort by S&Ls to shorten the average maturity of their assets as a hedge
against increases in the cost of their short-term liabilities. With depos-
it costs rising much more than average portfolio returns at S&Ls and MSBs
in the first quarter, these institutions suffered unprecedented losses.
S&L mergers are running well above last year's rate, but the increase
appears to derive largely from the desire of S&Ls to improve their long-run
competitive position and from passage of a Pennsylvania state law requir-
ing federal insurance of all institutions, rather than from current earn-
ings or capital problems.

In the primary market, mortgage rates advanced further during April
and early May. At a sample of S&Ls, the average contract interest rate on
new commitments for fixed-rate, level-payment conventional home loans has
increased 72 basis points since the last FOMC meeting, reaching 16.12 per-
cent--near the 16.35 percent record weekly high in 1980. Yields have also
risen on renegotiable-rate loans, with most lenders continuing to offer
initial concessions of up to about 75 basis points as an inducement to

III-18
borrowers to assume the interest rate risk. Uncertainty still surrounds
the pricing of the adjustable-rate mortgages just authorized by the
FHLBB (effective April 30) and by the Comptroller of the Currency earlier
this year.1
Surveys suggest a spreading use of financing techniques designed
to minimize borrower dependence on traditional financing at prevailing
market rates. Fifty-five percent of members responding to a survey by
the National Association of Home Builders indicated that in March they
were offering "buy downs" on new homes--typically featuring a reduction
of 2 to 3 percentage points in the interest rate payable by the buyer
during the first three years of the mortgage. In a survey of members
conducted by the National Association of Realtors during the latter part
of April, about half of all respondents indicated that during the preced-
ing six months, at least half of their existing home transactions involved
creative financing--particularly assumptions of first mortgages, often
combined with seller takebacks of second mortgages.
With yields on corporate bonds surging to new highs in early May,
secondary market yields on home mortgages remained under upward pressure,
especially those on FHA/VA loans, which are often pooled to back GNMA
issues. As deepening discounts on 14 percent FHA/VA mortgages discouraged
1. The FHLBB regulations give federal S&Ls wide latitude with respect to
the index used to adjust mortgage rates, the frequency and size of rate
adjustments, and the division of rate adjustments between monthly payments
and additions to principal. One large federal S&L in California has
announced that its new adjustable-rate loans will be priced at market
rates, with semiannual rate adjustments based on the industry's cost of
funds, and a limit of 7-1/2 percent per year on changes in the monthly
payment schedule. The flexibility of FHLBB's regulations reportedly
has been a consideration in the decision of several large West Coast S&Ls
to apply for federal charters.

originations of such loans, the ceiling rate on fixed-rate level payment
loans was adjusted up to a record 14-1/2 percent, effective April 13, and
then to 15-1/2 percent, effective May 8.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at a 12 percent annual
rate in March, the sharpest increase since September 1979. The speedup
resulted largely from a boost in growth of auto credit, associated with
the rebate-induced strength in new-car sales in late February and in the
first three weeks of March.
After negligible additions to consumer installment debt last year
and recent strong growth in personal income, the debt position of house-
holds had improved considerably by March. The ratio of consumer install-
ment debt repayments to disposable personal income was down to 16.4 per-
cent in the first quarter, compared with the record 17.7 percent reading
in mid-1979. Personal bankruptcies fell in the first quarter after surging
last year, when recession and reaction to an earlier liberalization of
federal bankruptcy law stimulated a record number of filings. Auto loan
delinquency rates at auto finance companies fell substantially in the
first quarter.

APPENDIX*
LIBOR-PRICED LOANS AND MEASURES OF BUSINESS CREDIT
Since the beginning of the year, loans to U.S. nonbank residents
at foreign branches of domestically chartered banks have grown rapidly,
reaching $7.5 billion in April. To aid in identifying the causes of re-
cent growth in these loans, an informal telephone survey was conducted of
five money center banks, four of which have been identified as being heav-
ily engaged in booking loans to U.S. nonbank residents at their foreign
branches (loans at foreign branches). This information has been supplemen-
ted by a number of press accounts dealing with growth in these loans.
According to the bankers contacted, the rapid spread of alternatives
to prime-based pricing of business loans underlies recent increases in
loans at foreign branches. Corporate customers--originally multi-nation-
als but now even mid-sized companies--increasingly insist upon the inclu-
sion of alternatives to prime-based pricing in loan agreements, the typi-
cal alternative being an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offer
Rate (LIBOR). Bankers stated that they are responding to competitive
pressures in satisfying customer demands for a LIBOR option.
A LIBOR pricing alternative is most likely to be included in a com-
mitment agreement for a term loan or a revolving credit facility with a
maturity in the one- to seven-year range. In such an agreement the bor-
rower is offered the option of an interest rate based on the bank's prime
rate or one based on LIBOR quotations made by one of the bank's foreign
branches. Under prime-based pricing, the loan rate floats with the prime
rate while, under the LIBOR option, the loan agreement typically specifies
a period over which the interest rate is fixed. This period, usually se-
lected by the borrower, most often is 3 months--in which case the loan is
priced off the 3-month LIBOR--but pricing periods vary from 1 to 9 months.
Typically, the borrower is permitted to switch from prime-based pricing to
LIBOR-based pricing at any time, but a switch from LIBOR- to prime-based
pricing is permitted only at the completion of a pricing period.1
* Prepared by Gary Gillum, Economist, Banking Section, Division of Re-
search and Statistics and Patrick Parkinson, Economist, U.S. Internation-
al Transactions Section, Division of International Finance.
1. Bankers were asked about the relationship between LIBOR pricing op-
tions and so-called below-prime lending by U.S. banks. They stressed
that the two types of loans are very different in nature. Below-prime
loans typically have very short maturities--frequently overnight but al-
most always less than 60 days--in contrast to the one- to seven-year ma-
turity of loans with LIBOR pricing options. Further, below-prime loans
have fixed interest rates while interest rates on LIBOR-priced loans are
adjusted periodically and therefore "float." Finally, below-prime loans
are priced off domestic money market rates such as the federal funds rate,
rather than being linked to LIBOR.
III-A-1

III-A-2
Policies regarding the booking location of loans with pricing op-
tions are not uniform among banks. Loans to U.S. corporations in which
the prime-based pricing option has been chosen virtually always are
booked at the head office. When the LIBOR-based option is chosen, many
banks book the loan at an offshore branch. For these banks, the booking
location is switched every time the customer exercises his option to
change the pricing of the loan. Other banks--including one contacted--
apparently book all such loans domestically on the grounds that the
loans, made to U.S. firms, are domestic in origin and should not be shif-
ted offshore simply because a pricing option has been exercised.
Those banks that book LIBOR-priced loans offshore view the loans
as being international in terms of pricing and funding, and properly
booked offshore. They pointed out that if a LIBOR-priced loan is not
funded in the Euromarket the bank is exposed to interest rate risks asso-
ciated with fluctuations in the spread between Euromarket and domestic
rates. Of course, booking and funding are separable decisions. For exam-
ple, a LIBOR-priced loan could be booked domestically and effectively
funded in the Euromarket by the head office's borrowing from its foreign
branch funds raised in the Euromarket. Indeed, the banks even acknow-
ledged that a LIBOR-priced loan may be funded domestically.
A more satisfying explanation for offshore booking is provided by
tax considerations. Tax practices in New York State provide strong in-
centives to book loans at offshore branches. If a loan is booked off-
shore rather than at the head office, a considerable portion of the in-
come on the loan is not subject to state taxation.1 To a lesser extent,
tax practices in California and Illinois also provide incentives for
banks to book loans offshore.
The availability of a LIBOR-pricing option should reduce the aver-
age cost to the borrower of a loan. Nonetheless, the borrower is faced
with a very complicated decision because the choice of LIBOR pricing
"locks in" the cost of funds for a period of time, forcing the borrower
to forecast the future course of both the prime rate and LIBOR. In prac-
tice, at least some borrowers' decisions tend to be linked with a small
1. The reason banks virtually always book prime-priced loans to U.S.
residents domestically is not clear. Perhaps they are concerned that
booking such loans offshore would lead New York State tax authorities to
reconsider the tax status of all activities at offshore branches. In
fact, one New York bank even books its LIBOR-priced loans onshore because
it fears an adverse reaction from the state tax authorities and bad pub-
licity if the loans were booked offshore.

III-A-3
lag to the observed prime rate-LIBOR differential.1 For example, as the
chart shows, loans at foreign branches began to increase shortly after
the prime rate rose above LIBOR in late 1980. On the other hand, borrow-
ers seem to respond with a longer lag when the prime rate falls below
LIBOR because they are "locked into" the LIBOR option for a predetermined
period of time.
The table shows that, through 1980, inclusion of loans at foreign
branches in business loans and business loans plus nonfinancial commer-
cial paper has little effect on their annual growth rates. However,
since the second quarter of 1980 the inclusion of such loans has signi-
ficantly affected quarterly growth rates for those measures of business
credit. Two caveats are in order, however, in the use of these data.
First, because loans at foreign branches may include substantial amounts
of loans to nonbank financial firms, loans at foreign branches strictly
speaking ought not be added to C&I loans. Correct procedures would be
either to add in only C&I loans at foreign branches or to add all loans
at foreign branches to C&I loans plus loans to nonbank financial inter-
mediaries. The measures actually used overstate to some extent the ef-
fect of including C&I loans at foreign branches, but available data do
not permit further improvement. Second, loans at foreign branches have
been seasonally adjusted by means of seasonal factors utilized for C&I
loans at large banks. These probably are not the correct seasonal fac-
tors, but the presumption is that loans at foreign branches are very
close substitutes for C&I loans at large banks. If so, the error intro-
duced by use of these factors is small.
1. The interest rate differential displayed in the chart is a proxy for
the prime-rate LIBOR differential. A three-month Eurodollar interbank
bid rate has been used because a reliable series for LIBOR is not avail-
able. The interbank bid rate typically is 1/16 to 3/16 percentage point
below LIBOR. The chart also cannot capture the various LIBOR maturity
choices confronting customers.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The dollar has appreciated by more than 8 percent on a weighted
average basis since the March Greenbook, including a 1-1/2 percent rise
since the French election on May 10. As illustrated by the chart on
the next page, the dollar strengthened fairly steadily over this
period. It appreciated by approximately 12 percent against the French
franc, nearly 10 percent against the mark and the other Continental
European currencies, 7-1/2 percent against the pound, 5 percent against
the yen and 1-1/2 percent against the Canadian dollar.
The strengthening of the dollar since the March Greenbook has
been mainly associated with the increase in dollar interest rates
relative to foreign interest rates. The chart shows that 3-month
dollar interest rates have risen by about 500 basis points over the
period, whereas foreign 3-month interest rates have increased by
less than 50 basis points on average. Notably, foreign interest
rate changes have differed widely across countries. Interest rates
have been relatively unchanged in Germany and have declined somewhat
in Japan and the United Kingdom. By contrast, interest rates have
risen by 300 basis points in Canada and by 200-300 basis points in
France, Belgium, and Switzerland, where official discount or inter-
vention rates have been raised.
A second factor that contributed to the dollar's rise since
the March Greenbook was the announcement of March balance of trade
figures for both the United States and Germany. The sharp reduction
in the U.S. trade deficit during the first quarter (international

decline in the German current account deficit during the first quarter
and data for March showing a reversal of much of the February improve-
ment.
The Desk's only intervention during the period was
a purchase of $74 million against marks on the day of the assassination
attempt against President Reagan.
Within the European Monetary System, the Belgian franc was under
strong pressure in late March and early April, while pressures on
the French franc mounted following Mitterand's election victory on
May 10. The intensification of pressures on the Belgian franc followed
the rejection of economic measures proposed by then Prime Minister
Martens, who resigned on March 31. Pressures on the franc eased
considerably during the second week of April, after several policy
actions were announced and a new government was formed, and the Belgian
currency has been comfortably above its intervention floor for most
of the subsequent period.

Gold prices have been less than $500 an ounce for most of the
period since mid-April, compared with prices close to $540 an ounce

OPEC surpluses and investment flows. For the second half of 1980
the OPEC current-account surplus is estimated at $48 billion, down mod-
erately from $55 billion in the first half of the year. (See table.)
Oil revenues of $137 billion in the second half of last year were $2 bil-
lion less than in the preceding half-year, as oil export prices rose
about 9 percent while export volume decreased 10 percent. OPEC imports
were held down by the hostilities between Iran and Iraq and increased
only 7 percent ($4 billion) from the first half of the year to the second,
an important factor in keeping the current-account surplus from declining
more rapidly. Net payments for services and private transfers, and OPEC
grant aid, together rose $3 billion.
On the basis of new Bank of England estimates, a much higher pro-
portion than before of total OPEC investment flows can now be identified,
at least in broad fashion. The new information relates to investments in
industrial countries other than the United States and United Kingdom, to
gold purchases, and to loans to developing countries.
Net new OPEC investments in the United States declined to about
$5 billion in the second half of 1980, roughly half as large as in the
first half. Holdings of Treasury bills, bank deposits, and other bank
liabilities, which had been built up in the first half, were run down by
$2.6 billion in the second, while accumulations of longer-term U.S.
securities were stepped up somewhat in the second half to $6.7 billion.
Other investments in the United States, largely consisting of changes in
U.S. Government non-security liabilities, were again small but positive
in the second half, in contrast to liquidations in 1979. For 1980 as a
whole OPEC investments in the United States of $14-1/2 billion were a

little more than double the 1979 amount, rising from 11 percent to
14 percent of the OPEC surplus.
Flows of OPEC funds into Eurocurrency deposits last year amounted
to $41 billion. While still the single most important OPEC investment
outlet, these new deposits diminished as a share of the total surplus
from about 50 percent in 1979 to about 40 percent in 1980, a percentage
much closer to the average for 1974-78. Placements in the Euromarket were
somewhat smaller in the second half of the year than the first.
Elsewhere outside the United States, OPEC flows into U.K. investments
(excluding Eurocurrency deposits) fell to a very small number in the second
half of 1980. Investments (excluding bank deposits) in industrial coun-
tries other than the United States and United Kingdom declined moderately
to $7.7 billion in the second half of the year from $8.1 billion in the
first. The 1980 total of such investments was equivalent to 16 percent of
the OPEC surplus, compared with 13 percent in 1979. Flows to individual
countries are not separately identifiable except to Germany, where long-
term OPEC investment last year came to $9.2 billion. Of that amount,
$6.7 billion was loans to official borrowers, and most of the flow to the
German private sector was also in the form of loans.
OPEC funds made available to the IMF and IBRD last year amounted to
$1.4 billion, mostly a $1.2 billion rise in the OPEC countries' IMF reserve
position. The Bank of England estimates OPEC gold purchases in 1980 at
$3.5 billion, about three times as much, in dollar terms, as in 1979. The
only identified OPEC investment outlet to show a decline in 1980 was loans
to developing countries. These loans (including subscriptions to regional
development institutions) decreased sharply from $9.6 billion in 1979

The merchandise trade deficit fell to $15 billion at an annual

quarter of 1980. The value of exports increased substantially, while
imports, particularly nonpetroleum imports, grew slowly.
The value of exports increased almost 10 percent in the first
quarter over the average for the fourth quarter of 1980. About one-
third of the increase was in agricultural commodities, particularly in

*/ International Transactions basis.
The merchandise trade data used in the International Transactions
account is virtually the same as the trade data used in the GNP
account. The only difference is that gold transactions are excluded
from GNP data but are included in International Transactions data. In
1980 gold exports amounted to $4.0 billion, and gold imports excluded
from GNP data amounted to $3.9 billion.

shipments of wheat and soybeans to Latin America and Africa. Non-
agricultural exports rose 8 percent from fourth-quarter levels with
most of the increase estimated to be in volume. By area, increases
in such exports were particularly strong to Canada and to a lesser
extent to Latin America. By commodity group, the increases were
concentrated in machinery and in industrial supplies. Coal exports
increased 16 percent, or by nearly $1 billion at an annual rate in
the first quarter. Virtually all of the increase was in volume; part
of the rise was attributable to strong foreign demand but some of the
increase was in anticipation of the coal strike that began March 27.
The strike should begin to affect export statistics towards the end
of April.
The value of imports increased only 5 percent in the first
quarter. About half the increase was in oil imports which grew by
$6 billion at an annual rate. All of this growth was due to higher
oil import prices resulting from the OPEC price increase of $3 per
barrel made at the end of the year. Price increases in the next
few months are expected to be minimal in the light of a continued
decline in spot market prices. Oil import volume was little changed
from the fourth quarter rate. Within the quarter, a sharp drop in the
volume of oil imports in March offset higher imports in January and
February. This sharp drop in the value of oil imports in March helps
to account for the shift to a trade surplus in that month.

The value of nonpetroleum imports also increased somewhat in
the first quarter. This increase was concentrated in industrial
supplies with a smaller increase recorded for consumer goods. About
half of the increase was estimated to be in volume. Foreign car
imports were about the same in the first quarter as in the fourth
quarter in both value and quantity; imports from Japan were above the
quarterly rate implied by the recent auto understanding.
Turning to capital account, outflows of funds through U.S.
banking offices were reported for both March and April. As shown in
the accompanying table, banking offices in the United States shifted
from a daily average of $7.4 billion in net borrowings from foreign
offices in February to $1.4 billion in net advances to these offices in
April. About 70 percent of this net $9 billion outflow was accounted
for by member banks.
Available data suggest that regional member banks, during March
and April, found it attractive to place funds borrowed in domestic
money markets in the Eurodollar market through their foreign branches.
One source of demand for these funds was large member banks that
increased their LIBOR-priced loans to U.S. residents booked at their
foreign branches; in March and April these loans increased by $1.6
billion. In late April these loans leveled off as the LIBOR-prime

differential disappeared. For a more detailed discussion of LIBOR-
based loans see the appendix following Section III, "Domestic Financial
Developments".
Also in the first quarter, money market mutual funds (MMFs)
increased their holdings of Eurodollar money market investments by
$4.5 billion, with about $2 billion of this increase reported for
March. However, in April, Eurodollar holdings of MMFs changed little;
at the end of the month, MMFs held slightly less than $12 billion of
Eurodollar investments. These accounted for about 10 percent of the
total assets of MMFs, a proportion which has shown little change over
the past year.
Investor interest in the MMFs that specialize in Eurodollars
has also grown at about the same rate as the total assets of all MMFs.
Although over the past year the total assets of these seven MMFs have
doubled to $20 billion, their one-fifth share of aggregate MMF assets
was unchanged. Thus, it appears that investors consider MMFs
specializing in Eurodollars as somewhat more risky than other MMFs

IV-13
since they have not increased the proportion of their MMF holdings
devoted to such funds even in the face of the generally higher yields
available from these funds.
Foreign official reserve holdings in the United States rose by
about $7.5 billion in March, compared with a $2 billion cumulative
reduction over the first 2 months of the year. OPEC countries
accounted for $4.4 billion of the March increase and for $5.4 billion
of the first-quarter increase in foreign official reserve assets. They
also accounted for the $1.5 billion increase in foreign official
holdings at the FRBNY in April. Increases in OPEC reserves have been
invested in a variety of assets including the medium-term-debt of U.S.
corporations; in March, $500 million of notes of three U.S. corporate
borrowers were purchased through private placements.
U.S. reserve assets rose by $700 million in March. The entire
increase reflected U.S. participation in the financing of IMF credit
facilities. Overall, drawings on the IMF (primarily by non-oil LDCs)
accelerated in the first quarter of 1981.
Net foreign private purchases of U.S. corporate stock totalled
$1.7 billion in the first quarter of 1981, only $100 million less than
the unusually high level of the fourth quarter. This is consistent
with the usual behavior of foreign investors in the U.S. stock market,
i.e., they tend to be net purchasers in a rising market.

Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity in the major
foreign economies remains weak. Recent data do not suggest an evident
trend in real activity. Industrial production has not shown a con-
sistent pattern in any of the major six over the past three months.
In the past two months industrial production rose in three countries and
fell in the other three and on average is below the year-ago magnitude.
Unemployment rates in the first quarter of 1981 were above those
of the previous quarter in the major European countries and increased
in the most recent months for the major countries which publish
monthly figures (Italy does not). Unemployment rates have fallen in
Canada and remained constant in Japan.
Consumer price inflation intensified in all the major foreign
countries between the final quarter of 1980 and the initial quarter of
this year with the exception of Italy. Among the same countries, only
in Germany and Canada was the inflation rate worse in the first quarter
of 1981 than over the same period a year earlier.
Major country current accounts (s.a., except Italy) improved
between the third and fourth quarters of 1980 with the exception of
Germany where the balance worsened. In Japan (s.a.) and Germany (n.s.a.)
current accounts worsened in the first quarter of 1981. In the three
countries where trade balances for the first quarter are available,
Canada, France and Japan, trade balances (s.a.) improved.
The most important, if uncertain, policy development abroad was
the election of Francois Mitterand in France. He ran on an expansionist

program. He will try to reverse the "Barre reforms" of the last
several years, nationalize major companies and the remaining private
banks, and increase minimum wages and reduce working time.
Central banks in Belgium, France, and Switzerland raised their
lending rates since the last Greenbook to strengthen their respective
currencies: the Belgian discount rate was raised to a record 16 per-
cent on March 31 but had declined to 14 percent by April 30; the French
raised their intervention rate to 12-1/2 percent on April 3 to 13-1/2
on May 5, and to 16 percent on May 12. Switzerland raised both the
discount rate and the Lombard rate by one percent, to 5 percent and
6.5 percent, respectively, effective May 11.
In Italy, the government proposed a fiscal package that would
reduce the fiscal deficit by about 5 trillion lire (about 1.5 percent
of GNP); however, this should be viewed as an implementation of the
budget rather than as a new tightening. In mid-April, Germany and
France announced a coordinated international borrowing of $6 billion.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan domestic demand has not yet
responded to the recent shift to a more expansionary demand-management
policy. Industrial production (s.a.) fell sharply in March to a level
less than two percent above the level of a year ago. The shift to
growth led by domestic demand still appears to be moving at a very
deliberate pace; private consumption remains weak and inventory adjust-
ments are continuing. Labor market conditions deteriorated somewhat in
March as well, as the ratio of job offers to job seekers fell by some
five percent (s.a.).Inflation continues to moderate. The WPI was un-

IV -19
changed in March and was less than two percent above its March 1980 level,
while the index of wholesale prices of manufactured goods fell in March
for the seventh consecutive month. Consumer prices in mid-April moved
upward only slightly, and the CPI was less than five percent above
its year-ago level for the first time since October 1979. The March
current account registered a small deficit bringing the total first-
quarter deficit to slightly under $1 billion. The swing from the small
fourth-quarter surplus in the current account was due to a marked de-
terioration in the services account, related in part to larger debt
servicing payments. Long-term capital inflows into Japan have contin-
ued strong in recent months. Net foreign purchases of Japanese stocks
and bonds were about $1.3 billion in March, bringing the total long-term
inflow from this source in FY1980 (ending in March) to almost $13 bil-
lion. Another $600 million in net inflow was recorded in March.
The German industrial production index declined by 4.5 percent
(seasonally adjusted monthly rate) in March after a jump of 5.7 percent
in February. The first-quarter level of the index was 2 percent above
the fourth quarter of last year. However, the usefulness of the index
is dubious due to recent rebasing problems. The rate of unemployment
has continued to rise and has reached 5.1 percent (s.a.) in April. Sur-
vey information continues to indicate weakness, and the volume of
domestic orders has not improved significantly. Orders from abroad,
however, have shown strong gains in recent months. Inflation, as
measured by the consumer price index, has continued through April at
an accelerated rate. The annual rate for the first four months of

IV -20
this year was about 8-1/2 percent. After unusually long negotiations,
the metalworkers' union appears near agreement with management on wage
increases of about 5 percent. This contract tends to set the pace for
other industries in German wage negotiations. On May 11 the 2.6 mil-
lion member Public Employees Union settled on a 4.3 percent wage in-
crease.
The current account showed a $1.3 billion deficit in March, which
brings the annualized (n.s.a.) deficit for the first quarter to $18
billion, compared to a deficit of $15.5 billion last year.
In the United Kingdom unemployment continues to rise. The un-
employment rate in April 1981 was 10.1 percent (s.a.). However, the
slowing in the rate of increase in unemployment as well as the increase
in industrial production in February suggest that the U.K.'s recession
may be coming to an end. The increase in the industrial production
index in February was the first monthly increase since the 0.1 percent
rise recorded in June 1980. Consumer and wholesale prices have accel-
erated in 1981. In the 6 months to March 1981, consumer prices rose
10-1/2 percent (a.r.), and for the 6-month period ending April 1981
wholesale prices increased by 12-1/2 percent (a.r.); at the end of
1980, comparable inflation rates were 7-1/2 percent and 5-3/4 percent,
respectively. In part, the price increases in March were the result
of increases in indirect taxes announced in the U.K.'s March 1981
budget. According to a U.K. government estimate, about two-thirds of

IV -21
the 1-1/2 percent March increase in consumer prices is attributable
to measures announced in the budget. (The April price indexes also will
be affected by budget measures.)
In France the recent victory of the Socialist Mitterand in the
presidential election overshadows recent economic developments and casts
a shadow over the future performance. President Mitterand ran on an
expansionary platform, but one that may also demoralize if not para-
lyze private sector decision makers. A retreat from "liberalism" and
a return toward "dirigism" is expected. Extensive nationalizations,
increased minimum wages, reduced hours for the same pay, early retire-
ment, a reduction in the foreign sector, reduced nuclear energy devel-
opment, increased employment in the public sector (250,000), and tax
reform are all expected.
The details of new government proposals and the strength of the
left in Parliament will probably not be known until early July after a
new National Assembly is elected.
Economic performance in the first quarter of this year was, by
most indicators, inferior to an already poor performance in the final
quarter of last year. Industrial production in January and February was
5 percent below the previous quarter. In the first quarter of this year
unemployment reached a historical high (the series starts in 1974) of
7.1 percent, well above the 6.5 percent reported in each of the previous
three quarters. Consumer price inflation in the first quarter was 12

IV -22
percent (n.s.a.r.), marginally above the 11.2 percent rate of the
previous quarter, but well below the rate for the first quarter of
1980. Since the election the Barre Government has raised the inter-
vention rate to 16 percent and abolished the 5 percent reserve require-
ment on non-resident franc deposits in an attempt to support the franc.
In addition reserve requirements on resident deposits were increased,
presumably to offset the liquidity effect of reduced reserves on non-
resident deposits. In mid-April the government announced a FF15 bil-
lion borrowing on international markets to be coordinated with a sim-
ilar borrowing by Germany. The proceeds will be used for subsidized
credits for activities economizing on energy and raw materials,
activities to increase productivity, and activities using advanced
technologies. The Socialistshave suggested they may float a FF20 bil-
lion loan on the domestic market.
In Italy economic activity in the early part of this year was
stronger than expected; industrial production in the first quarter of
1981 maintained the level reached in the fourth quarter of 1980. The
March CPI data point to a slight cooling of inflation; the index rose
1.4 percent compared with an average monthly rise of 1.8 percent over
the previous two months. Preliminary indications for April suggest a
further slight deceleration. In February the trade deficit fell to
$1.3 billion,and for the first two months of 1981 the deficit averaged
$1.6 billion, continuing the improvement began in the fourth quarter

IV -23
of 1980. Exports have revived slightly, while imports have declined
from the very high levels of last summer. As part of its economic
stabilization program, the Italian cabinet has agreed on a fiscal
package designed to reduce spending and raise revenues, having a net
effect on the deficit of about 5 trillion lire. The package is in-
tended to restrain the growth of the public sector deficit, which is
currently threatening to exceed (by a wide margin) the level the
Government previously proposed for 1981. The government's proposed
measures still must obtain Parliamentary approval.
In Canada evidence suggests that real GNP growth in the first
quarter of this year moderated from the 8 percent (s.a.a.r.) growth
posted in the fourth quarter of 1980. The index of industrial production
for the three-month period ending in February of this year was flat; in
the previous three-month period the index rose by over 2-1/2 percent.
Consumer price inflation accelerated during the first quarter of this
year. For that quarter the index rose almost 13 percent (a.r.),
compared with the over 11 percent rate posted in each of the preceding
three quarters. The energy and food components of the index experienced
the largest increases during the first quarter. In the first quarter of
1981, the trade account showed a surplus of $1.5 billion as compared with
a surplus of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 1980.
In Belgium industrial production (n.s.a.) has remained below year
ago levels from October to the latest available data (January). The
unemployment rate, which rose to 9.1 percent in December, has remained

IV -24
above 9 percent through February. While the consumer price index
actually fell slightly in April as a result of the price freeze imposed
for that month, the inflation rate as measured on a month-over-year-ago
basis remains at approximately 7 percent. The Martens government
responded to renewed pressure on the Belgian franc in March by proposing
a tightening of fiscal policy and reform of the wage indexation system.
Disagreement within the cabinet over the latter measure, in particular,
caused the government to fall. On April 6 the former Minister of
Finance, Mark Eyskens, became the new Prime Minister. The new govern-
ment imposed a total price freeze for the month of April, thereby de-
ferring temporarily the issue of reform of the wage indexation system,
and proposed a generally restrictive package of government spending
limits and tax and wage reductions for firms similar to that urged
by the previous government. The general price freeze was allowed to
expire on April 30, but a selective price freeze was implemented in its
place. As part of the government's effort to defend the franc, the
Belgian National Bank raised its discount rate to a post-war record
16 percent on March 31. In response, three-month interest rates rose
from 13.2 percent in early March to 17.2 percent in early April. By
mid-April pressure on the franc lessened and the Bank lowered its
discount rate to 15 percent on April 16 and to 14 percent on April 30.
In Switzerland retail sales figures suggest that the pace of
real economic activity remains strong. The unemployment rate in April
remained at 0.2 percent, unchanged from the level reached in February

IV -25
and March and also in April 1980, While the consumer price index fell
slightly in April, the inflation rate has risen sharply in the past
six months. For the first four months of 1981 the consumer price in-
dex averaged 5.8 percent higher than in the same period in 1980. For
1980 the comparable average increase was 4.3 percent. On May 11, in
response to weakness of the Swiss franc on the exchange markets, the
rising inflation rate, and the strong domestic economy the Swiss
National Bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by one percentage
point to 5 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively.
