The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity has shown little, if any, advance in recent months
following the surge early in the year. This slowing was evident in most
major sectors of final demand. Unit auto sales continued through mid-June
at the sluggish pace that has prevailed since the termination of the
rebates, and real consumer spending on nonauto items declined in both
April and May. Housing starts fell sharply in May, while real business
spending apparently receded in the spring following its earlier strong
advance. Broad measures of inflation registered smaller increases in
April and May than in the first quarter, mainly because of unchanged or
declining gasoline and food prices.
Industrial Production
Gains in industrial production have been considerably less so far
this year than the brisk increases in the second half of 1980. Output
rose only 0.3 percent in May, following essentially no change in April.
More than half of the May increase was due to a 7 percent rise in automobile
assemblies to a 7.3 million unit annual rate. Production of business and
defense equipment continued to expand in May, while output of construction
supplies fell. In June, even with the boost to output resulting from the
settlement of the coal miners' strike and the further rise in automobile
assemblies to a 7.4 million unit rate, industrial production apparently
declined slightly.
Employment
The small gains in industrial production in recent months have
been accompanied by continued sluggishness in factory hiring. Employment

in the manufacturing sector fell slightly in May, following several
months of small increases. The factory workweek edged up in May to a
level 1/4 hour above the fourth quarter average. Construction jobs with
weakness in all major categories, fell further in May, and employment
in this sector was no higher than at last July's trough. But sustained
hiring at service establishments and a rebound in employment in the trade
sector to its February level balanced the decreases in the goods-producing
industries in May, and nonfarm payroll employment in the aggregate remained
at its April level.
Total household employment, which recently has been increasing
faster than the payroll series, rose 260,000 in May. But unemployment
also jumped, after holding steady for several months, and the overall
jobless rate reached 7.6 percent--the same as the peak rate of last
year. Most of the rise in May unemployment was reported among persons
who lost or voluntarily left their last job, rather than among new entrants
to the labor force. However, this rise in job terminations has not been
confirmed by weekly labor market data for June. Initial claims for
unemployment insurance through late June were not significantly higher
than in April and May, and in the auto industry the number of workers on
indefinite layoff--while still very high by historical standards--continued
to trend down.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Personal income rose at only a 7 percent annual rate in nominal
terms in April and May, compared with a 12 percent rate in the first
quarter. Wage and salary disbursements were particularly sluggish during

the spring, due to the strike by coal miners and the leveling off of
payroll employment in other sectors. The nominal income gains over
recent months have been matched by inflation, and real disposable income
has been stagnant since March.
Consumer spending has slowed slightly more than income, in the
past few months, as households have sought to build savings following a
29-year low in the saving rate during the winter. Retail sales excluding
automobiles and nonconsumption items in nominal terms have been flat
since their strong advance in March. Sales in most major categories of
stores registered only small changes in May. Purchases at stores in the
GAF grouping, which sell mainly discretionary items, were about unchanged
after a large gain in April, as slight declines at general merchandisers
and furniture and appliance dealers balanced a small increase at apparel
stores.
Auto sales continued weak into mid-June. Sales of domestically
produced automobiles averaged 5-3/4 million units in the first 20 days
of June. This was in line with the average pace since the termination
of the rebates in late March and still below the 6-1/2 million unit rate
that had been sustained for several months preceding the rebates. Domestic
auto stocks rose to 1.4 million units at the end of May, equivalent to a
75 days' supply at that month's sales rate, and likely were substantially
higher at the end of June, since production continued to exceed sales.
Purchases of imported autos edged down to a 2.2 million unit annual rate
in May--the lowest since last summer.
The weakness in household spending is consistent with the subdued
buying intentions reported in recent consumer surveys. Appraisals of

buying conditions for consumer durables and houses have remained
remained relatively depressed throughout the spring, according to both
the University of Michigan and Conference Board surveys, apparently
reflecting continued concern over credit conditions and the high prices
of these items. Composite indexes of consumer confidence remained near
their most recent recovery highs in June; the Conference Board survey
revealed a further improvement in attitudes, while the Michigan index
turned down, following several months of increases in both surveys.
Residential Construction
Housing activity has weakened markedly in recent months, reflecting
the tightening of financial conditions since last fall. Private housing
starts fell 14 percent in May to an annual rate of 1.15 million units, a
rate 25 percent below that in the fourth quarter of 1980. Starts of both
a multifamily and single-family units were at reduced levels in May, with
a somewhat sharper decline in the single-family sector. Multifamily
activity continues to be supported by the sustained demand for condominium
and cooperative apartments. In the first quarter of 1981, starts of
these "for sale" units, which comprised almost half of the total in the
multifamily sector, were a third above a year earlier.
The decrease in new building activity in May followed a general
overall deterioration in home sales. Sales of new houses in May,
despite a sharp upturn that month, were down a fifth since last summer.
Purchases of existing homes, which also have been trending down, fell an
additional 4 percent in May.
The average price of a new house sold in May was 15 percent above
a year earlier, while the average price of an existing house sold was
10 percent higher. These May figures were boosted by the transitory

drop in house prices a year earlier; year-to-year increases in recent
months generally have been substantially less than those recorded during
the past several years. Moreover, recent trends in transaction prices
probably understate the effective deceleration in house price inflation.
When compared with the price trends of the past few years, prices lately
have increasingly incorporated compensatory payments to sellers for
concessionary financing arrangements.
Business Fixed Investment
Capital spending apparently fell in real terms during the spring,
following the vigorous growth in the first quarter. In the equipment
area, shipments of nondefense capital goods in real terms in May were
3 percent below the first quarter average, and business purchases of
motor vehicles have been sharply depressed since March. In the nonresi-
dential structures area, real outlays on new construction declined 1.3
percent in April to a level slightly below the advanced first-quarter
average. The only sign of capital spending strength was for oil well
drilling; drillings in April and May were 20 percent above the 01 average.
Current backlogs of unfilled orders should sustain equipment
spending over the next few months. But with constant-dollar new orders
for nondefense capital goods weak in April and May, some spending declines
could occur later in the year. Activity in the nonresidential construc-
tion area likely will weaken further in coming months; contracts dropped
sharply in April and May, continuing the trend of the first quarter, and
in real terms are little higher than they were last summer.

Investment surveys also point toward sluggish real capital spending
over the remainder of the year. The Commerce Department May survey of
fixed capital spending anticipations indicated that businesses plan to
increase spending an average of 8.4 percent in nominal terms this year--
almost 2 percentage points less than the plans reported in the February
survey. Given the 18 percent annual rate rise in outlays in the first
quarter, this seems to leave little room for further advances over the
remainder of the year.
Inventory Investment
Manufacturers' inventory investment remained moderate in May. The
book value of manufacturers' stocks rose at an annual rate of $17 billion,
about the same as in April. These recent increases were considerably
below those recorded earlier in the year when producers rebuilt stocks
drawn down during the second half of 1980. Manufacturers' shipments rose
0.7 percent in May, and the stock/sales ratio remained at 1.57.
Retail and wholesale trade inventories rose at a $5.1 billion annual
rate in constant dollars in April, after five months of liquidation. The
April rise largely was due to the beginning of the second quarter buildup
of automotive stocks. Inventories at merchant wholesalers rose at a
$1.3 billion rate, as runups in auto products, machinery, and building
materials were partially offset by some liquidation in nondurable
merchandise.
Government Sector
The federal government unified budget deficit for May was $16
billion, significantly more than had been anticipated by the Administra-
tion. The underestimation of the deficit mainly was a result of personal
income and social security withholdings falling short of projections.

II-16
Outlays apparently were consistent with the Administration's expectations,
although the distribution was different; continued shortfalls in defense
expenditures and declines in unemployment compensation outlays were
offset by accelerated spending for the strategic petroleum reserve,
lower-than-anticipated repayments of Commodity Credit Corporation loans,
and limited sales of financial assets.
The First Concurrent Resolution on the fiscal 1982 budget was passed
by the Congress in mid-May. The resolution is in general agreement with
the Administration's budget proposals and recommends outlays of $695
billion and receipts of $658 billion in FY1982, resulting in a deficit
of about $38 billion. Reconciliation instructions included in the resolu-
tion require that the authorizing committees of Congress reduce the cost of
existing programs by about $36 billion. The Senate and House have approved
reconciliation bills that are consistent with this target.
The budget resolution allows for tax cuts of $9 billion in fiscal
year 1981 and $51 billion in fiscal year 1982, sufficient to accommodate
the Administration's original tax cut proposals. Subsequently, the
Administration has scaled back its recommended tax reductions to $2 billion
in FY1981 and $38 billion in FY1982. The Senate Finance Committee has
reported a bill that is in general agreement with the Administration's
revised program. Meanwhile, deliberations by the House Ways and Means
Committee on tax reduction continue.
State and local governments have curtailed their spending in
recent months, partly in response to reductions in federal grants-in-aid.
Employment fell 40,000 in May and has decreased 80,000 over the past
six months. In large part, this decline reflects the ongoing elimination

II- 17
of federally funded public service jobs. CETA enrollments have fallen
180,000 since December; a Labor Department survey suggests that fewer
than half of the laid-off CETA workers have been transferred to regular
payrolls. The value of new construction activity dropped a record 12
percent in April, with declines recorded for all major State and local
government categories. This drop follows a very strong gain in the first
quarter, however, and the value of new construction in real terms in the
first four months of 1981 was almost 5 percent above that in the fourth
quarter of 1980.
Prices and Labor Costs
Declining food and gasoline prices continued to hold down increases
in broad measures of inflation in May, and the inflation rate for some
other consumer commodities has been running below last year's rate.
However, homeownereship costs accelerated in May, and prices for capital
equipment continued to advance at the double-digit pace evident since
early 1980.
Consumer food prices, which were little changed over the first four
months of 1981, edged lower in May. Price declines were widespread in
May, but meat prices rose slightly, after falling for four months. In
addition, farm prices for livestock--especially live hogs--increased
sharply in June, amid signs that pork production is trending lower.
Retail energy prices have risen only slightly on average since
March, as decreases for petroleum products largely offset higher natural
gas and electricity rates. Gasoline prices fell about 1-1/2 percent per
month in April and May, and industry sources indicate that these prices

II-19
Homeownership costs, which had contributed to the slowing
of the CPI during 1981-Q1, registered the first large increase this
year in May. This acceleration was due to a sharp upturn in the home
purchase index combined with a further advance in mortgage interest
rates. The CPI measure of home prices is limited to FHA-insured homes
and therefore may not be representative of broader trends; the May turn-
around brought this measure more in line with other indicators of house
prices, which have shown moderate increases over the past half-year.
The mortgage rate index rose about 2 percent on average in April and
May. Because mortgage rates are recorded with a lag in the CPI, actual
changes in mortgage costs that occurred in May are expected to boost
homeownership costs further over the next few months.
Apart from food, energy, and homeownership, consumer prices have
risen at an 8-1/4 percent annual rate this year, down from the 10 percent
rate over 1980. Smaller increases, on average, this year, for some
commodities, such as used cars and apparel, contributed to this slow-
down. At the same time, price pressures have been especially persistent
for consumer services; services other than home financing and energy
costs have risen at a 10 percent annual rate in the last few months,
about the same as the first quarter. Also, producer prices for capital
equipment rose at a 10-1/2 percent annual rate in April and May, only
slightly below the 11-1/2 percent pace of the first quarter. Increases
in capital goods prices were widespread, covering agricultural equipment
and construction machinery as well as machine tools and electrical
equipment. In addition, prices for motor vehicles were increased sharply
in April and May for many domestic and imported models.

II- 21
To a large extent, the momentum in underlying inflationary trends
stems from the pressure of increases in labor costs. However, some
possible amelioration in these pressures is indicated by recent data,
as the increase in wages during the first five months of this year was
slightly below the 1980 pace. Smaller wage gains in the retail trade
and service sectors were instrumental in holding the increase in the
hourly earnings index for all nonfarm production workers to a 6-1/2
percent annual rate between March and May, following a 10 percent rate
in the first quarter. However, such a deceleration typically occurs in
the quarter following a hike in the minimum wage. But more importantly,
manufacturing wage increases--at a 9-1/2 percent rate so far this year--have
been running about 1-1/2 percentage points below the rate posted in
1980. Data from the Employment Cost Index also indicated that wage and
salary rates for unionized workers, particularly in manufacturing industries,
advanced less rapidly in the first three months than during the same
period a year earlier. This may reflect, in part, this year's light
calendar for new bargaining settlements. However, increases in the ECI
for white collar workers, particularly professionals and managers, were
much larger early this year than during 1980-01.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1-B, adjusted for the effects of shifts into NOW accounts, declined
in May and June following the surge in April. M2 has expanded less rapid-
ly since April, reflecting not only contraction in M1-R, but also a pause
in the growth of money market funds in May. M3 has continued to expand
rapidly, however, because of the sharp rise in large time deposits.
Since the mid-May FOMC meeting, interest rates have fallen on
balance as market participants have been impressed by an evident level-
ing off of economic activity and a moderation of inflation as well as
by the weakness in money growth. These expectational factors have out-
weighed the influence of the federal funds rate, which has fluctuated in
an 18-1/2 to 19-1/2 percent range. Most short-term interest rates are
about 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percentage points below their early May high levels,
although the commercial bank prime lending rate--now 20 percent--has risen
1 point on net. Yields on longer-term taxable bonds have fallen by about
1 to 1-1/2 percentage points from their all-time highs of early May. How-
ever, average rates on conventional fixed-rate home mortgages in the pri-
mary market have remained close to record high levels.
Overall business credit demands have been substantial in recent
months, apparently as a result of an increase in external financing re-
quirements. Throughout May and in early June, these larger demands
surfaced principally in the commercial paper market and at banks, owing in
part to a reluctance by firms to borrow long-term at such high cost and
also to expectations of a further decline in bond rates. During the inter-
meeting period, the Treasury raised virtually no new money from the public,
but borrowing by state and local governments remained fairly strong.

Activity in residential mortgage markets has continued weak, reflecting
both high interest rates and the difficulties of thrift institutions,
although reports indicate that nontraditional financing methods are
still a significant source of credit at below-market rates. Available
data on consumer spending and bank lending point to continued sluggish-
ness in consumer installment debt formation.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1-B, shift-adjusted, declined at a 5 percent annual rate in May and
at an estimated 5-1/2 percent rate in June.1 During this period M1-A con-
tracted, and other checkable deposits declined slightly on balance after
having grown rapidly during the first four months that NOW accounts were
available nationwide.2
For the second quarter as a whole, M1-B adjusted is estimated to have
increased at a 5-3/4 percent annual rate, somewhat slower than would be
expected on the basis of standard econometric formulations of the demand
for money, which allow for the sharply reduced pace of GNP growth in the
second quarter and generally higher interest rates since late 1980. Accord-
ing to the Board's quarterly model, the shortfall in narrow money growth
in the second quarter was about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate, following
a shortfall of more than 7 percent at an annual rate in the previous quar-
ter. A modified version of this model, designed to capture the incentives
1. Money stock data reflect benchmark revisions published on June 26.
At that time, travelers checks of nonbank issuers were included in M1-A
and the broader aggregates. This revision raised the levels of the
aggregates by more than $4 billion in 1981 but only minimally affected
growth rates.
2. Information from a survey by the Survey Research Center of the Univers-
ity of Michigan suggested that households continued to open new interest-
bearing transactions accounts in May, although at a slower pace than early
in the year.

provided by high interest rates for adoption of new cash management tech-
niques, showed essentially no net error over the first half and thus gives
some support to the notion that there was indeed a significant downward
shift in the public's narrow money demand as conventionally conceived.
Reflecting in part the decline in M1-B, M2 decelerated in May and
June from the rapid April pace. The nontransactions component of M2
expanded at a somewhat slower rate as well, especially in May when the
lagging response of money market fund yields to earlier rate increases
led some investors to move funds directly to market instruments. Higher
rates may have accounted also for a more rapid contraction of savings
deposits in May and June; in any event, these outflows were more than
offset by growth of small time deposits, primarily in the form of money
market certificates. More recently, as market rates have backed off
from their May peaks, money market fund growth has resumed at a brisk
clip.
Despite slower M2 growth, the previous pace of expansion in M3
was maintained during May and June as large time deposits surged after
two months of decline. In May, commercial banks stepped up their reliance
on managed liabilities, largely to fund a substantial rise in earning
assets as core deposits weakened. This expansion in managed liabilities
included borrowings of more than $9 billion from related foreign offices.
In June, banks' funding requirements were boosted by a $3-1/2 billion
outflow of U.S. Treasury balances.
Large time deposits at savings and loan associations also have
increased moderately, despite sluggish mortgage lending by these institu-
tions in the aggregate, but have shown signs of softening in recent weeks.

Weakness in deposit growth and earnings, in conjunction with recent public-
ity associated with failures and mergers, has caused investors to be cau-
tious in making repurchase agreements with some S&Ls or in acquiring their
large CDs. Reports indicate that the strongest S&Ls are paying 100 basis
points over the highest quality commercial bank CD rate, compared to the
historically more typical 25 to 50 basis-point spread, and that weaker S&Ls
are paying an additional 100 basis points, if they can issue large CDs at
all.
Bank credit expanded in May at an 11-1/2 percent rate, the most rapid
pace since January, with particular strength in holdings of U.S. government
securities. Business loan growth quickened to a 7-1/4 percent annual rate
from its earlier sluggish pace, while real estate lending showed moderate
growth, and consumer lending was weak. In early June a continuation of
these trends was evident at large banks, while very preliminary data for
small banks pointed to some weakening in business loans.
The May Survey of Senior Loan Officer Opinion indicated that there
had been some easing of nonrate lending terms in the period since Feb-
ruary; a fair number of respondents reported lower compensating balance
and fee requirements and easier standards of creditworthiness for prime-
based loans. At the same time, however, the May Survey of Terms of Bank
Lending showed a substantial drop in the proportion of loans made at rates
below prime at large banks--from more than 70 percent in February to 38
percent in May--a development that may reflect a narrowing in the spread
between the prime rate and market rates over that interval.

Business Finance
Total external financing by nonfinancial business firms appears to
have increased considerably in May and June. This development appears
to have been associated with a widening of the corporate financing gap,
in part reflecting an unanticipated build-up of inventories against a
backdrop of weakening profits. Increases in credit demands have been
concentrated in short-term markets as potential long-term borrowers have
continued to forgo bond offerings in anticipation of more favorable con-
ditions. In addition to the rebound in bank business loans, nonfinan-
cial commercial paper issuance has grown exceptionally rapidly in this
period. Paper dealers report that oil companies have been borrowing
significant amounts to finance their inventories.
Although corporate bond yields have declined about 1-1/2 percentage
points since reaching new highs in early May, with about 1 percentage point
of the drop occurring after the May FOMC meeting, the pace of public cor-
porate bond offerings in May and June continued at about the moderate
April rate, falling short of that in the first quarter. The prevailing
market view is that there is a massive potential supply of new issues that
would be offered if rates were to decline somewhat further. A substantial
volume of issues has been registered with the SEC in 1981 and not yet been
sold; moreover, new registration procedures allow issues to be brought to
market relatively quickly.
Equity prices have shown a mixed pattern over the intermeeting period
but on balance are little changed. The volume of new equity offerings de-
clined sharply in May to $1.3 billion but jumped to $2.3 billion in June,

when AT&T sold a record $1.0 billion of common stock. So far this year,
new equity volume has been running about 25 percent above the record pace
set last year.
A number of indicators attest to the toll that the economic and
financial stresses of the past few years have taken on business firms.
Bankruptcy filings by businesses rose to a new record this spring after
having declined in the second half of 1980.1 Similarly, preliminary
data on business failures reported by Dun & Bradstreet have shown a
decided upward movement this year, with failures since the beginning of
1981 averaging about 40 percent more than last year.
Short of such drastic results, many firms have seen their bond
ratings deteriorate, extending a trend that first became apparent about
a year ago. Downgradings and withdrawals of ratings on long-term debt
by Moody's Investor Service reached a seven-year high of 40 in the first
half of 1981. As was the case last year, downgradings exceeded upgrad-
ings by a 2 to 1 margin and were widely dispersed across industries. In
addition, yield spreads between lower- and higher-rated long-term corporate
bonds have been widening in recent weeks. In the commercial paper market,
downgradings and terminations of ratings have also continued to outnumber
the few ungradings, but the weakening has been less than in the 1974-75
period, reflecting a higher degree of selectivity which has prevailed in
this market since that time. Downgradings and withdrawals of ratings on
1. Since early 1980, filings have been fluctuating above the previous peak
set in 1975; however, these data must be interpreted cautiously for two
reasons. First, filings apparently have been encouraged by changes in the
bankruptcy code which became effective in late 1979. Also, when scaled by
the number of total firms, bankruptcy filings are well short of the postwar
high established in the early 1960s.

savings and loan commercial paper have accounted for two-fifths of the
total negative actions this year.
Government Finance
Since mid-May the Treasury has raised essentially no new money from
the public. During this period, the Treasury raised $7.7 billion of cash
through its regular sales of notes and bonds, but it also paid down $2.5
billion in the regular weekly and monthly bill auctions and $4.0 billion
of cash management bills sold last February. Net redemptions of savings
bonds are estimated to have absorbed approximately $1 billion of cash over
the period--despite an increase in their rate to 9 percent on May 1--and
foreign accounts redeemed a small amount of nonmarketable issues.
Further sizable borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies in
May and June is estimated to have brought the second quarter total to $9.5
billion (not seasonally adjusted), an increase of $6.0 billion over the
first quarter. This surge in agency borrowing was primarily accounted for
by the Federal Home Loan Banks, which raised $6.7 billion of new cash--more
than four times the level raised in the first quarter. The FHLBs used these
funds primarily to finance a $5.5 billion increase in advances to thrift
institutions. The Farm Credit Banks borrowed $3.3 billion in the second
quarter, but FNMA paid down $500 million of longer-term debt, reflecting
its continued low level of mortgage purchases and a switch toward short-
term borrowing.
Gross long-term security issuance by state and local governments was
down in May and June from the pace of earlier months. On the other hand,
borrowing in short-term markets was unusually heavy in May, mainly as a

Yields on tax-exempt bond issues are slightly lower, on average,
than they were in mid-May; nowever, the relative decline has been less
than on long-term corporate securities. Although the forward supply
is heavy for both types of obligations, the failure of tax-exempt yields
to drop further apparently reflects reduced demand by institutional inves-
tors. Holdings by large commercial banks of longer-term state and local
obligations have declined thus far this year as these institutions have
shifted their acquisitions toward shorter-term tax-exempt obligations.
In addition, property/casualty companies reportedly have been selling
large amounts of such issues at capital losses in order to offset capital

III-15
gains from real estate sales. Consequently, dealer inventories reportedly
have swelled; the record size of the Blue List provides some confirmation
of this phenomenon.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on new commitments for fixed-rate conventional home
mortgages at S&Ls have declined only slightly from their unprecedented
levels reached in late May; contract rates currently exceed 16 percent
in all regions of the country and are close to 17 percent in the West.
However, field reports continue to stress that borrowing costs of many
homebuyers have been limited through buydown arrangements and loan assump-
tions. Moreover, below-market rate mortgages financed through earlier
issues of tax-exempt bonds continue to be a factor of some importance,1
and adjustable-rate home loans apparently are being marketed by private
financial institutions at interest rates somewhat below those on fixed-
rate contracts.2
Nevertheless, the generally high level of rates and cautious lend-
ing policies have depressed residential mortgage activity. In May the
volume of commitments outstanding at S&Ls fell for the sixth consecutive
month as new commitments declined to $5.0 billion, nearly 50 percent
below the recent peak last August; net acquisitions of mortgages by these
1. On June 30, the Treasury Department announced regulations clarifying
some of the restrictions imposed on single-family mortgage revenue bonds
issued by state and local governments. The volume of such tax-exempt
securities has been sharply curtailed so far in 1981, owing in part to
questions about the details of last December's federal law that restricts
this type of financing through 1983 and bans it thereafter.
2. FHLMC and FNMA recently announced new purchase programs that should
facilitate originations of adjustable-rate conventional home mortgages
with interest rates that change periodically with market interest
rates during the life of the loan. The FHLMC program takes effect July 1,
and the FNMA program August 7.

institutions, meanwhile, edged down to $1.9 billion. Balance sheet data
through April for mutual savings banks continue to indicate that partici-
pation in the mortgage market by these institutions has languished. At
life insurance companies, where cash flows have been eroded by policy
loans, mortgage commitments have been falling since late 1979; the sharp-
est declines have been in the residential components, while commitments
for long-term mortgage loans to businesses have held up comparatively
well.
Government support of the residential mortgage markets has remained
quite low even in the face of weakening activity at the major private
lenders this year. The volume of advances made by the Federal Home Loan
Banks to member institutions has been substantial, but the cost of these
funds has been high, and recently the FHLBB restated its policy of lend-
ing only to cover net deposit withdrawals and takedowns of existing loan
commitments. Total mortgage commitments outstanding at the major federal
and related agencies operating in the secondary markets have dwindled
since last fall, even in nominal terms. Commitments at GNMA have edged
up on balance, but commitments have declined slightly at FHLMC and have
fallen substantially at FNMA. The contraction at FNMA reflects the
serious erosion in the earnings of this quasi-public agency, which has
attempted to boost its income partly by imposing higher commitment fees.
As the issuance of mortgage purchase commitments by FNMA has de-
clined, GNMA-guaranteed passthrough securities have become a relatively

home loans in the primary market. Rate ceilings on FHA/VA loans have
caused discounts in primary and secondary markets--including the GNMA
market--to rise substantially several times this year as market yields
have climbed, but the current ceiling of 15-1/2 percent on level-pay-
ment home loans is holding discounts to relatively low levels.
Consumer Installment Credit
Continued weakness in auto sales and apparently sluggish retail
sales activity suggest that the demand for consumer installment credit
has remained slack since April. Installment debt had expanded at a 9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate during April, marginally above
the first-quarter pace but less than the 12 percent rate of growth during
March which accompanied auto rebates. On the supply side of the market,
the mid-May Survey of Senior Loan Officer Opinion indicated a moderate
reduction--for the third quarter in succession--in the willingness of
larger banks to accommodate consumer credit demands. Preliminary data
for large banks indicate that consumer lending continued weak into June.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The dollar has appreciated by nearly 4-1/2 percent on a weighted-
average basis since the May Greenbook. The weighted-average change
consisted of bilateral appreciations of roughly 8 percent against the
pound, 4-1/2 percent against the mark and other EMS currencies and
3-1/2 percent against the yen, with almost no net change against the
Canadian dollar and a depreciation of about 1/2 percent against the
Swiss franc. As shown by the chart on the next page, the weighted-
average dollar climbed by nearly 5 percent between the date of the May
Greenbook and early June, despite a decline of about 1-1/2 percentage
points in dollar interest rates and increases in foreign interest rates
of 70 basis points on average--about 4-1/2 percentage points in France
and 1/4 to 1/2 percentage points in Japan, Germany, Switzerland and
the United Kingdom. During this period, downward pressures on the EMS
currencies were associated with the French elections, the increase in
tensions over Poland, and the budget debate in Germany, which drew
attention to Chancellor Schmidt's fragile political base and the un-
certain support for restrictive economic policies. In addition, the
pound weakened substantially during the first week of June when the
reduction in Mexican oil prices was widely interpreted to forecast a
similar reduction in British oil prices, as was subsequently announced
on June 15. Since the second week of June movements in the dollar
have been associated primarily with fluctuations in dollar interest
rates as foreign interest rates on average have declined by 35 basis
points.

The Desk has not intervened for
U.S. official accounts since the end of March.
Within the European Monetary System the French franc fell to its
lower intervention limit following the French elections on May 10
Much of this weakening was reversed,
however, after the new French administration acted on May 22 to support
the franc by raising interest rates sharply, tightening controls on
leads and lags in import payments and export receipts, and requiring
that purchases of foreign securities by French residents be channeled
through a securities franc market for foreign exchange in which the
availability of foreign currency is limited to the proceeds of foreign
security sales by French residents. At one point, following the
appointment of Communists to the French cabinet in the latter part of
June, the premium on the securities franc rose to nearly 7-1/2 percent.
The Belgian franc declined to around its lower intervention limit

during the second half of June
The weakening of the Belgian franc has been associated
with a decline of 2 percentage points in Belgian interest rates since
the date of the May Greenbook.
The price of gold has declined by nearly 15 percent since the
May Greenbook date and is currently around $425 an ounce. Silver
prices have dropped from about $11 to around $8.50 an ounce since the
May Greenbook, falling sharply at the end of June after Congress
authorized limited sales of silver from the U.S. strategic stockpile.

U.S. International Transactions
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in May was about the same as
in April. For the two months combined the deficit was $30 billion
annual rate; this was about one-third larger than the deficit for the
first quarter. Exports in April/May combined declined marginally but
imports rose 3 percent.
A drop in the value of agricultural exports during April/May more
than accounted for the total export decrease from high first quarter
levels. First quarter agricultural shipments were very strong to

*/ International Transactions basis.
The merchandise trade data used in the International Transactions
account is virtually the same as the trade data used in the GNP account.
The only difference is that gold transactions are excluded from GNP
data but are included in International Transactions data. In 1980 gold
exports amounted to $4.0 billion, and gold imports excluded from GNP
data amounted to $3.9 billion.

Eastern Europe (U.S.S.R.), Japan and Latin America. The April/May
decline was largely in volume and was spread primarily among wheat,
corn, soybeans, and cotton.
Nonagricultural exports increased somewhat in April/May from the
strong first quarter level. Exports to Canada, a market for nearly
one-fourth of our nonagricultural exports, provided much of the
increase. Commodity categories with the largest increases were
automotive parts for assembly in Canada, and civilian aircraft exports.
Partly offsetting the increases was a 30 percent drop in coal exports
from strong first quarter levels as the effect of the coal strike
was felt.
Oil imports have shown sharp month-to-month fluctuations recently.
On average, however, the value of oil imports in April/May was only
marginally higher than in the first quarter; the volume of oil imports
declined slightly while import prices on average rose 3 percent. The
average price rise occurred despite a sharp decline in May import
prices, by 95 cents per barrel. Official price reductions have been
announced by various oil producing countries in an attempt to maintain
export volume. As world demand has weakened, total OPEC production
has declined but Saudi Arabia has continued to produce over 10 million
barrels per day.

Most of the increase in April/May imports was in commodity
categories other than oil particularly steel, machinery, passenger
cars shipped from Canada, and to a much lesser extent foreign cars
and trucks. The rise in steel imports was by far the largest single
increase; it was largely in pipe products which are in relatively
short supply in the United States and in sheet steel. The value of
foreign car and truck imports was marginally higher than their first
quarter level. Sales of foreign cars in the United States have kept
well ahead of imports since the beginning of the year and dealers'
inventories have been drawn down steadily. In May as foreign car
sales declined slightly inventories leveled off at about the low April
level. The first year of the agreement by the Japanese to restrain
passenger car exports to the United States began April 1. Offsetting
these increases was a decline in food imports, particularly coffee and
sugar.
U.S. International Capital Transactions. Beginning late in April
and continuing through May, a substantial shift in the net position
vis-à-vis their foreign offices took place at banks operating in the
United States. As shown in the attached table, the daily average of
the banks' net borrowings rose by more than $9 billion in May as
compared to April, although there has been a partial reversal of this
flow since late May. The net inflow in May occurred during a period
of substantial upward pressure on the dollar's international value,
associated in large measure with a rise in U.S. interest rates. As
the dollar's value rose under this pressure, foreign authorities under-
took to limit the extent of the movement through net dollar sales

IV -8
between late April and early June of some $7 billion in foreign-
exchange markets, of which $4 billion or more was financed through
sales of financial assets held at the New York Federal Reserve Bank
(principally Treasury securities). In addition, holdings of other
countries at the New York Bank declined, net, by over $2 billion as
U.K. and Swiss authorities reduced their holdings and other authorities
acquired assets, including an net increase of nearly $700 million in
OPEC holdings. (U.K. authorities were mobilizing funds to repay
international debts.)
Such a decline in credit to the U.S. economy from official
sources abroad must be replaced by an increase in foreign private
credit (absent a radical change in the current account); in this
instance, the increase in private credit took the form of inflows to
banking institutions in the United States through their foreign offices.
Thus the improvement in market participants' views of prospects for the
dollar's value, which was the source of the upward pressure on the
dollar, was manifested in increased net claims (dollar deposits and
repayments of borrowings) by foreigners on foreign offices of U.S.
banks and increased holdings of U.S. Treasury securities by U.S.
residents. The increased holdings of Treasuries were financed,
directly or indirectly, by U.S.-located banking offices' borrowings
from their foreign affiliates.

The U.S. current account surplus increased to $12.3 billion
annual rate in the first quarter from a surplus half that size in the
fourth quarter of 1980. See the table below. While part of the
increase resulted from the smaller trade deficit, net investment
income receipts also increased. Unilateral transfer payments declined
from a high fourth quarter figure that reflected a bunching of U.S.
government grants to Israel. Partly offsetting these net increases
was a sharp increase in U.S. travel expenditures abroad and a reduc-
tion in direct investment income receipts. The drop in receipts
resulted primarily from weaker manufacturing profits abroad, primarily
in the automobile, chemical and computer industries.

Foreign Economic Activity. While economic activity still remains
relatively weak in the major foreign industrial economies as a whole,
there are tentative signs of strengthening in recent data for some countries.
The pace of real growth in both Germany and Japan quickened in the first
quarter, although in both cases private consumer demand remained soft,
and in Japan, industrial production in April and May was weak. In Italy
and Canada, first-quarter real growth, although positive, was below
fairly strong fourth-quarter rates. GDP fell in the United Kingdom in
the first quarter, but industrial production data through April suggest
that the prolonged slump there may be nearing an end. Based on preliminary
first-quarter data, GNP appears to have declined in France as well, but
recent French surveys indicate that activity may have stabilized. In
all countries, unemployment remains at high levels.
No discernable overall trend has been evident in recent price and
wage developments, although in some countries depreciation, particularly
against the dollar, has contributed to additional upward pressure on
prices. Inflation appears to have abated somewhat in Germany, but France,
Italy, and Canada have gained little ground in their effort to reduce
inflation -- despite a continuation of relatively tight monetary policies.
Progress in the reduction of recent large current-account deficits
in the major industrial economies has been, at best, halting and uneven.
Despite some improvement in April, the cumulative German deficit for
the first four months of 1981 still exceeds that of the previous four
months. Also in April there was some contraction in the small Japanese
current-account surplus, due in part to an increased deficit on invisibles,
and in Canada the trade account weakened slightly. Moderate trade-account

IV -12
gains seen in Italy in recent months can be attributed in part to earlier
depreciation of the lira.
Individual Country Notes. Recently released GNP data for Japan
in the January-March quarter confirm the previously reported slow advance
of the domestic economy. Although real GNP rose by about 4-1/2 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, up from 2 percent in the previous quarter,
most of the strength was in government consumption and government investment.
Only small gainsweremade in private consumption, while increases in net
exports and private equipment investment -- two components that previously
had been sources of strength -- were minimal. Although the impression
of continued softness in the Japanese economy is supported by a sharp
drop in the industrial production index in May, recent assessments by
the Bank of Japan and the Japanese Economic Planning Agency suggest that
the pace of recovery -- particularly of personal consumption -- may
have picked up recently.
Upward pressure on wholesale prices appears to have intensified
somewhat in May, as the WPI rose by more than 0.8 percent. A large
part of the increase was due to the 2-1/2 percent depreciation of the
yen against the dollar in May; the yen-based price indices for both
exports and imports rose in May by a like amount. The CPI, however,
fell by 0.5 percent in June to a level about 4-1/4 percent above its
year-ago level. The average 7-1/2 percent wage settlement (only slightly
above last year's increase of about 7 percent) agreed to in this year's
recently completed round of spring labor negotiations, together with
expected productivitygains, has enhanced the prospects for maintaining
control over inflation for at least the next twelve months.

The Japanese current-account surplus contracted in May by about
$300 million to slightly over $1/2 billion. This drop resulted from
a decline in Japanese exports and a continued expansion of the deficit
in the services and transfers account (to a $1.2 billion level) caused
in part by larger interest payments. Long-term capital inflows strengthened
in May following the substantial net outflow of the previous month.
Net foreign portfolio investment in Japan in May was about $400 million,
but there were net foreign sales of Japanese bonds. Because of recent
declines in government bond prices in the secondary market the government
has been obliged to raise the yield on new issues to the financial
syndicate.
First-quarter GNP growth in Germany was surprisingly strong at
2.7 (s.a.a.r.) percent over the fourth quarter of last year. This
unexpected strength came largely from the export sector where decline
of the D-mark has made German products more competitive. Demand for
capital goods also provided strength, but the domestic consumer sector
was flat, and construction declined further.
Industrial production in April rose by about 1 percent after
a 3.5 percent decline in March. The average of the index for the first
four months of this year was about 2 percent (s.a.) above that of the
preceding four-month period. The rate of unemployment has been rising
steadily since the spring of 1980 and in May reached 5.3 percent (s.a.)
which is a post-War record.
The consumer price index in Germany rose by 0.5 percent in June,
following a 0.4 percent increase in May. The annualized rate this
year through June, however, was about 8 percent. Strong acceleration earlier

IV -17
and the recent slowing of consumer prices reflects, at least partly,
a similar previous movement of import prices, which rose at an average
monthly rate of 3 percent earlier this year and were flat in April.
The trade deficit for the first four months of 1981 has increased
in comparison with the last four months of 1980, largely on the basis
of an adverse movement in the terms of trade. In April, however,
there was a marked improvement in the trade account, which moved from
near balance (n.s.a.) in January-March to a surplus of $1.5
billion.
Money-market interest rates in Germany rose sharply in response
to the special Bundesbank policy measures of February 19 and have remained
at these higher levels. Long-term interest rates responded more gradually
but are now also significantly above their February levels. While the
Bundesbank has acknowledged its concern with the exchange rate as a
major factor in its interest rate policy, it has rejected the claims
that monetary policy is too tight for domestic conditions. Central
Bank Money, the Bundesbank's targeted variable, has moved in the middle
of the 4 to 7 percent target range through May.
In the United Kingdom, real GDP declined by about 1 percent (s.a.a.r.)
in the first quarter of 1981 -- the fifth consecutive quarter in which
GDP has fallen. Nevertheless the rate of decline is slowing, and data
on industrial production seem to indicate a bottoming out of economic
activity. The rise in industrial production (s.a.) in February was
followed by two months of very small decreases, and in April the level
of production was above that prevailing in January. Consumer prices
increased by only 3/4 percent in May, considerably below the rates of

IV -18
inflation recorded in March and April when increases in various indirect
taxes and public charges boosted the consumer price index. Wage inflation
has moderated in 1981. In the 6 months to April 1981, average wage
earnings increased at an annual rate less than 10 percent (s.a.), about
one-half the rate of growth in wages during 1980. On the other hand,
the price index for materials purchased by U.K. manufacturers has been
rising sharply. In May 1981 it rose 2-1/4 percent, and in the 6 months
to May it increased by some 23-1/2 percent (a.r.). This rise in the
cost of materials reflects in part the decline in the external value
of the pound (particularly against the dollar). A labor dispute involving
civil servants has prevented the U.K. government from publishing data
on trade and the current account for recent months.
In France, preliminary data suggest that GDP fell by nearly 4 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter following a decline of about 3 percent
in the fourth quarter of last year. First-quarter consumption expenditure
was unchanged, but investment expenditure fell nearly 5 percent below
the previous quarter's level primarily because of weakness in private-
sector business investment. Recent survey data indicate that the fall
in investment has stabilized, but orders and other investment demand
indicators still are weak, and inventories remain excessive.
In May, inflation in France returned to the first-quarter level
of roughly 1 percent a month, after an acceleration in April. Wholesale
prices over the past year have risen by about 7 percent.
The French trade balance in the first quarter was in deficit by
roughly $2-3/4 billion, an improvement of $1/2 billion over the previous
quarter and an improvement of nearly $3/4 billion from the first quarter

IV -19
of 1980. In April-May the trade balance has improved further, primarily
because of the slow pace of activity in France.
Policy measures of the new Mitterrand Socialist government are now
being announced weekly. Measures announced so far include an increase
of 10 percent in the minimum wage, a 20 percent increase in old-age
pensions, and a 25 percent increase in family allowances, allowances
for the handicapped, and housing allowances. The housing allowance will
be raised by another 25 percent at year-end. These measures are expected
to increase the general government deficit by 6-8 billion francs (about
0.2 percent of GDP) in 1981. The government also plans to spend an
additional 6.8 billion francs on "youth employment pacts", public
employment, additional loans and assistance to business, housing, and
social programs for the agricultural sector. One-time taxes on those
earning high incomes in 1980, taxes on oil company and bank profits, as
well as new taxes on business expenses and luxury hotels are expected
to offset the new expenses this year.
The June credit controls were loosened to allow an additional
5 billion francs in credit, which will add less than 1/2 percent to
monetary growth for the year if not repeated. Banks have agreed to reduce
commerical discount rates for short-term small and medium business loans.
Short-term interest rates in France have risen recently to almost
20 percent from their roughly 13 percent average level in April, providing
some support for the franc, and capital controls have been reimposed.
In Canada real GNP growth in the first quarter of this year was
4 percent (s.a.a.r.), which is down from the upward-revised fourth-quarter
1980 real growth rate of 9.2 percent (s.a.a.r.). This moderation in

IV -20
real growth was accompanied by an acceleration in consumer price inflation
despite continued high short-term nominal interest rates established
at the end of 1980. (At present the Bank Rate is more than 19 percent.)
For the most recent three-month period (March to May) the consumer price
index rose more than 13 percent (a.r.), compared with an almost 12 percent
increase in the previous three-month period. In April of this year,
the trade-account surplus fell to $104 million from $415 million in
March. For the first four months of this year, however, the surplus
remained larger than that recorded for the same period in 1980.
In Italy, economic activity in the early months of the year has
continued to show signs of recovery after 1980's sharp mid-year drop.
In the first quarter industrial production was slightly stronger than
in the last quarter of 1980, but it declined slightly in April.
Recently released data indicate that GDP in the first quarter rose
1.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) after an 8.4 percent increase in 1980 QIV. The
two main sources of recovery appear to be the external sector and investment
goods. The depreciation of the lira, which has allowed Italy to regain
some of its lost competitiveness, has probably led to a strengthening
of exports and to domestic substitution for imported goods.
Consumer prices rose in May by 1.4 percent, the same rate as in the
previous two months; this marked a deceleration from the 1.8 percent
average monthly rate for the six months ending in March. However, wholesale
prices have recently accelerated, presaging a fresh acceleration of
consumer prices in the future.
The trade balance continued to show improvement in the first
four months of 1981, with an average monthly deficit of $1.5 billion

IV -21
compared with an average monthly deficit in the previous six months of
$2.3 billion. In addition to the effects of improved competitiveness,
a reduction of speculative inventory imports helps account for the
improvement.
The Forlani government fell at the end of May, while it was trying
to implement its economic stabilization program designed to reduce
inflation and stabilize the exchange rate. As one element of the program,
the authorities had proposed a package of spending cuts and tax increases
to stem the increase in the burgeoning public sector deficit. This
package, which had not received Parliamentary approval, was enacted
-- temporarily -- through decree laws. Its fate under the new Spadolini
government is as yet undetermined.
The huge growth in the public-sector deficit, and the consequent
pressure on the Bank of Italy to finance part of it, has led to substantial
monetary-base creation through this channel. Primarily in order to
absorb the monetary base, the Italian authorities on May 27 imposed
an import deposit scheme, requiring a 30 percent deposit on foreign
payments (with certain exclusions) to be held in a non-interest-bearing
account for 90 days.
In the Netherlands real activity remains slow. Industrial production
(s.a.) rose slightly in April, but remained below the peak rate achieved
in May 1980. The unemployment rate increased slightly to 8.6 percent
(s.a.) in May. The current-account surplus of $0.6 billion recorded in
the first quarter of 1981 was an improvement of over $1.5 billion from
the previous quarter. Regularly scheduled elections in May resulted
in the loss of the necessary majority for the existing coalition government.

IV -22
Efforts by Prime Minister van Agt to form a new coalition and remain
in power continue.
