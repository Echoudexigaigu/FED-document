The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most indicators of production and sales suggest that economic
activity has shown little movement in recent months. During the spring
quarter, activity had dropped-off, reflecting in part the weakness in
homebuilding and the post-rebate slump in auto sales. Although autos and
housing continue to be extremely weak, there are no indications of cumulating
weakness; there was a widespread pickup in labor demand in July and industrial
production rose somewhat. Owing in part to a leveling-off of petroleum-
related prices and a continuation of relatively little change in food
prices, aggregate price measures continued to decelerate in the second
quarter. Accompanying the slowing of inflation, wages increased less
rapidly in the first half of 1981 than during 1980.
Industrial Production
Early data suggest that industrial production edged up about 1/4
percent or so in July, after a small decline in June. (Industrial
production data will be released August 14.) Recent developments in
economic activity have been reflected in the performance of the
industrial production index. A quick cyclical rebound in the second
half of last year followed the extremely sharp spring contraction
(chart). Unlike past recoveries, which typically continue for about a
year, this expansion lost momentum after only six months, and by July
industrial output was only about 1-1/4 percent above its level at the
end of 1980. In July, coal output continued its post-strike rebound
and the production of business machinery increased, but these gains
were partially offset by reductions in output of transit equipment. After
allowance for the usual drop associated with a model changeover period,

seasonally adjusted auto assemblies edged down in July to a 7.2 million
unit annual rate; production of trucks declined more sharply. Changes
in materials output in July varied by industry, but overall rose somewhat.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing in July probably continued
close to the preliminary 79.6 percent rate that prevailed in June.
During the entire first half of the year the utilization rate held close
to 80 percent. In June, declines in utilization were widespread among
manufacturing industries except in motor vehicles and related industries.
However, a number of these changes were apparently reversed in July as
steel production rose and auto output edged off. Materials utilization
rates apparently also changed little in July.
Employment
After several months of sluggish growth, labor demand picked up in
July. The household measure of employment rose 570,000 in July--after
plummeting 840,000 the previous month, and the unemployment rate declined
0.3 percentage points to 7.0 percent. This is the lowest rate reported
in more than a year. The establishment survey reported an increase of
385,000 jobs to payrolls--the largest monthly increase in the now year-
long recovery period, with net gains in most sectors. Manufacturing
employment rose 110,000. About 60,000 of the increase occurred in
durable goods. The advance in this sector was concentrated in industries
associated with the production of business equipment, which have fared
significantly better in the past year than the auto and related metals
industries. Among producers of nondurable goods, employment rose by
almost 50,000; most of this increase occurred in apparel and textile
products industries.

Outside of manufacturing, service and retail trade payrolls each
posted a gain of 85,000. For services, this represents a return to its
usual pace after a month of slow growth, while the jump in retail trade
employment is much larger than the average gain of 30,000 per month
experienced over the past year. Mining employment increased 30,000, as
striking coal miners continued to return to work. Construction employ-
ment, down another 20,000 in July, is now below the trough of a year ago.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Nominal personal income rose in June at about the same 7-1/4 percent
annual rate as in May; these advances compare with the 12 percent gain
posted in the first quarter. The wage and salary component, which tends
to parallel movements in employment and hours over the short run, accounted
for the deceleration in the rate of growth. Much of the modest second
quarter advance in income was offset by price rises; as a result, real
disposable income increased at only a 1-1/4 percent annual rate during
this period, compared with a 3 percent pace during the winter quarter.
Real consumer spending fell in the second quarter at a 1.9 percent
annual rate. In addition to the slump in auto purchases, declines in
real terms were registered for other durable goods as well as for energy-
related outlays. As a result of this retrenchment in spending, the
personal saving rate rose to 5-1/4 percent--up from the 4.6 percent rate
in the first quarter.
The weak pace of auto purchases continued into the third quarter.
Sales of new domestic autos in July--at a 5.9 million unit annual rate--
bettered the extremely low June sales performance, but were only a little
above the 5.6 million unit selling rate posted for the entire second

quarter. Except for the period of credit controls last year, sales of
domestic units over the past four months have been lower than at any
time since the final two months of 1970 when a strike against General
Motors and a recession combined to depress domestic sales to a 5.4 million
unit annual rate. Sales of new imported cars picked up slightly in July
to a 2.3 million unit annual rate, interrupting a downtrend in foreign
car purchases that began in April.
Consumer surveys by The Conference Board and the University of
Michigan Survey Research Center continued to give mixed signals in July.
Reflecting consumer attitudes about business conditions and their
personal financial situation, both surveys showed an overall improvement
in attitudes to about the same level as reported during the cyclical
rebound last November. The University of Michigan survey also reported
that consumers, as in June, expected an inflation rate over the next 12
months of less than 7 percent--the lowest inflation expectation reported
in this survey since mid-1977. Nonetheless, attitudes toward buying conditions
of durable household goods, automobiles, and houses continued to be
relatively depressed. Follow-up questions in the University of Michigan
survey on the reasons for these responses indicated continued consumer
concern about the high price of cars and houses as well as credit
conditions.
Residential Construction
Activity in housing markets weakened further in the early summer
months, as financial conditions continued to tighten. Total private
housing starts fell in June to just over one million units at an annual

rate, down 33 percent from the fourth quarter of 1980 and the lowest--
except for May 1980--since early 1975. Newly-issued residential building
permits likewise dropped sharply in June to 976,000 at an annual rate,
also well below historical norms.
The poor performance of housing starts paralleled continued softness
in new-house sales. These sales in June fell 17 percent to a 408,000
unit annual rate, with weakness widespread regionally. Sales activity
in June was below the cyclical low recorded in the 1973-1975 downturn and
just barely higher than the troughs of 1970 and 1966. Existing-house
sales in June, while edging up to a 2.7 million unit annual rate, were
still quite depressed.
New residential construction activity has waned in both the single-
family and multifamily area. In the rental sector, vacancy rates in the
second quarter of 1981 returned to a record low of 5.0 percent for the
25-year series. In the single-family sector, inventories of unsold new
houses fell to 312,000 at the end of June--the lowest level in the last
five years, but in terms of the June sales rate, this backlog was equal
to a 9-1/4 months' supply.
There continues to be substantial appreciation in the measures of
house prices over year-earlier levels, although part of the actual
return to sellers may be offset by the costs of concessionary financing.
The average price of an existing house sold during the second quarter
was 9-1/2 percent above a year earlier, while that for a new house was
14 percent higher. The average sales price of a standardized new house
in the second quarter of 1981 was 8-1/2 percent above a year earlier.

Just as high costs of credit on conventional mortgage financing
have prompted alternative "creative" means of funding, the high purchase
price of traditional homes has encouraged alternative ways of meeting
demands for shelter. Mobile home shipments in May were at a 255,000
unit annual rate--slightly above the rate at the end of last year.
Further, expenditures on additions and alterations to existing structures
have continued to rise at a relatively rapid pace (chart). In the second
quarter of 1981, such spending was 12 percent above a year earlier and more
than 40 percent higher than three years earlier; construction expenditures
on new residential dwellings have fallen 10-3/4 percent over the same
three-year period.

Real business fixed investment fell at a 6 percent annual rate in
the second quarter, following the 13 percent first quarter surge. In
the business equipment category, a substantial gain in shipments of
electrical machinery was more than offset by declines in spending for
nonelectrical machinery, motor vehicles, and other transportation
equipment. In the construction category, the volatile petroleum drilling
and mining components jumped, while spending for business structures
experienced a broad-based decline. In June, constant dollar nonresiden-
tial construction activity edged off, following a fall of about 1.0
percent in May.
Capital spending commitments data suggest a stagnation of real
business investment spending over the near-term. Total constant
dollar commitments have been essentially flat for the past two quarters,
but separate indicators of the equipment and structures components

appeared to have diverged somewhat by mid-year (chart). Real orders for
nondefense capital goods declined steadily since March, and June's level
of these commitments was 4-3/4 percent below the last quarter of 1980--
thus, suggesting near term weakness ahead. Real nonresidential building
permits have edged up somewhat this year, but they still remain below
their level in 1979.
Inventory Investment
The pace of business inventory accumulation appears to have accelerated
only slightly since the first quarter, and ratios of stocks to sales indicate
a generally cautious business inventory posture (chart). The book value of
manufacturers' inventories remained virtually unchanged over June, as a $5-1/2
billion annual rate accumulation of durable stocks was offset by a comparable
liquidation of nondurable stocks. By stage of fabrication, the composition
of inventory change over the second quarter as a whole reflected the loss of
momentum in the growth of manufacturing output. Work-in-process inventories
were drawn down in June, following the liquidation of stocks of raw materials
and supplies during May; finished goods were accumulated at a brisk pace in
both months.
At the trade level, stocks of the automotive and construction sectors
have risen substantially, but aggregate inventories have remained about in
line with sales. The book value of wholesale trade inventories increased
substantially in June, in part reflecting increases in motor vehicle stocks--
mainly recreational vehicles and foreign-made cars. A buildup of domestic
car stocks at automotive dealers began in April; despite this accumulation,
auto production has continued to exceed sales for the past four months.
The July pickup in sales and adjustment in production were not sufficient
to prevent a further run-up, and dealers' stocks continued to accumulate.

Government Sector
Federal government purchases of goods and services (NIPA basis)
declined sharply in the second quarter because of a liquidation of
Commodity Credit Corporation inventories that had increased during the
first quarter. Purchases of defense goods and services continued at
the high first quarter rate.
The Administration's Mid-Session Review of the budget, released
July 15, projects a FY81 deficit of $55-1/2 billion--only slightly
higher than the previous estimate prepared in March. However, there
were a considerable number of changes to the size and composition of
outlays and receipts. Increases in estimates for interest payments and
costs of farm price support programs were only partially offset by down-
ward revised estimates for some transfer items and defense purchases.
Additionally, revenue estimates were raised by the postponement of the
effective date of personal tax cuts until FY82. The FY82 deficit
projected by the Administration was revised downward slightly to $42-1/2
billion. The projected level of outlays is close to $10 billion higher
than in March, primarily reflecting larger interest costs than previously
anticipated. Projected revenues are about $12 billion higher, on balance,
as the scaling back of the proposed tax reductions more than offset the
effect of lower expected oil prices on windfall profits tax receipts.
Nearly all of the Administration's FY82 program was ratified by
Congress in recent weeks; the major exception was a new proposal for
social security financing designed to trim outlays by $3-3/4 billion.
The budger reconciliation bill, which would reduce nondefense spending
in FY82 by $35-1/4 billion from existing law, was close to Administration

anticipations. Similarly, the tax bill sent to the President in early
August provided for $37-3/4 billion in revenue cutbacks, closely matching
the Administration's mid-year proposals for reductions in personal
income taxes and stepped-up depreciation write-offs. (A description of
the provisions of the tax bill is contained in Appendix II-A.)
At the state and local government level, July data indicate a rise
in payroll employment of about 70,000, following the 180,000 drop over
the first half of the year. The earlier fall-off was in large part the
result of the phase-out of federally-funded public service jobs. The
July pickup is in line with recent Department of Labor reports that a
significant number of laid-off public service employment workers have
been reinstated on regular state and local payrolls.
Construction activity at the state and local government level remains
weak. Outlays decreased 1.0 percent in June, and in real terms construc-
tion expenditures have declined over 15 percent since December 1980.
Lower outlays were reported in June for all types of projects except
highways and streets, which had fallen sharply earlier in the year.
Construction outlays, often viewed as a postponable expenditure by state
and local government units, have undoubtedly been constrained by both
reduced federal support and high interest rates--about one-third of state
and local capital projects are bond financed.
Prices
Broad measures of prices have indicated a slowing of inflation in
recent months. Much of the recent deceleration has been concentrated in
energy markets; petroleum-related prices have leveled off or declined

following a surge early in the year. But, in addition, food prices have
been essentially flat for most of this year. On the other hand, home-
ownership costs jumped sharply in the second quarter, owing to a surge
in the volatile home purchase index and continued increases in mortgage
interest costs. Rates of increase in prices of other than food, energy,
and homeownership items also have moderated somewhat. In addition, prices
for capital equipment rose somewhat less in June than in earlier months
this year.
Consumer food prices continued to rise quite slowly in June, with
the moderation fairly widespread. Despite the downturn in meat produc-
tion in the second quarter, additionally upward price pressures for meats
apparently are still being tempered by consumer resistance to the already
high level of prices. Many other consumer foods were favorably influenced
by a confluence of events, including a spring-time recovery from last
winter's freeze of fruit and vegetable supplies and declines in the prices
of internationally traded commodities such as sugar, coffee and cocoa.
However, labor cost pressures at all levels of the food industry have
continued to be intense this year, suggesting some likelihood of price
hikes later this year. In addition, advance supply indicators point to
further declines in meat production in coming quarters.
Excluding food, energy, and homeownership, consumer prices rose
at about an 8-1/2 percent annual rate during the first half of this
year--down from the 10 percent rate of 1980. This reduction reflects
a significant slowdown in residential rents and in apparel and upkeep
prices, where increases through mid-year were at half the rate of 1980.

Wages and Labor Costs
The easing of inflation has been accompanied by some slowing in the
rate of increase of wage rates for most workers. The rise in the hourly
earnings index for production and nonsupervisory workers in the private
nonfarm sector of the economy--9-1/2 percent over 1980--decelerated to
about an 8-1/4 percent annual rate during the first seven months of this
year. Slowing has been most marked for manufacturing workers, who
received especially large increases last year. Hourly compensation--
a broader measure of wage costs that includes fringe benefits and nonwage
payments for all workers in this sector--increased at a 9-1/2 percent
annual rate in the second quarter, somewhat below the 10 percent advance
over the four quarters of 1980.
Wage rate increases provided by major collective bargaining agree-
ments that were signed during the first half of this year averaged 11-1/4
percent in the first contract year and 9-1/4 percent annually over the
life of these contracts, excluding possible further increases under cost-
of-living clauses. These increases exceeded the increases contained
in settlements reached in 1980 by nearly 2 percentage points. However,
the number of workers covered by these new settlements is relatively
small due to the light bargaining calendar, and a large portion were in
the construction and coal mining industries where settlements have
tended to be larger than average. In the building trades, new union
contracts have provided wage increases averaging 11 percent over the
contract life so far in 1981, down slightly from the 1980 figure. The
new coal settlement will raise wage rates an average of 10-1/4 percent
a year over the 39-month contract.

Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector declined at an
annual rate of nearly 1 percent in the second quarter, following the
4-1/2 percent rate rise in the first quarter that accompanied the burst
of output growth. Since the cyclical peak in the first quarter of 1980,
output per hour has grown at a 3/4 percent annual rate--about the same
peak-to-peak rise as over the previous business cycle. However, the
cyclical recovery in real output growth typically produces stronger than
average productivity increases, and over the three quarters from 1980-Q3
to 1981Q1, output per hour rose at only a 2-1/2 percent annual rate--well
below past performance. Reflecting recent movements in compensation
and productivity, unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector
rose at a 10-1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, following
a 7 percent increase in the first quarter. From mid-1980 through mid-
1981, these costs rose 8-1/4 percent.

APPENDIX II-A*
SUMMARY OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 1981 AND
AN OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET AT MID-SESSION
Two major elements of the Administration's economic program for
fiscal year 1982 and beyond, the reconciliation bill which reduces
spending and the tax bill, were enacted in July and early August. These
measures were largely anticipated in the Mid-Session Review of the 1982
Budget, released on July 15. The table below places estimates of the
reductions in costs of nondefense programs and of reductions in revenues
that will result from these two bills in the context of the Administra-
tion's Mid-Session budget estimates for fiscal years 1982, 1983 and 1984.
The table shows that the reconciliation bill is estimated to cut
spending in fiscal year 1982 by $35.2 billion, about $12 billion less
than the total reductions announced in the Reagan Administration's
March budget revisions. The Administration is reported to believe that
the remainder of the outlay reductions can be achieved by administrative
actions (for example, personnel ceilings) and by reductions in single
year appropriations which were not subject to the reconciliation process.
Major appropriations bills for fiscal year 1982 are yet to be enacted.
The table also shows, however, that outlay estimates were revised upward
by $13.3 billion between March and July. Of these revisions, $10.3
billion are accounted for by interest-related costs (principally interest
on the public debt but also including higher costs for deposit and credit
insurance programs). Scattered technical re-estimates in other programs
and the fiscal 1982 effects of the supplemental appropriations enacted
for fiscal year 1981 also raised estimated outlays. These higher costs
are only partially offset in fiscal 1982 by the Social Security financ-
ing proposals made by the Administration after the March budget and
incorporated in the Mid-Session Review. These proposals have not yet
been taken up by the Congress.
In future years, the effects on the budget of current, higher-than-
anticipated interest rates and other technical factors are assumed to
dwindle rapidly as interest rates fall rapidly in the Administration's
projections. The gap between cost reductions estimated to result from
the reconciliation bill and those announced in the March budget widens
in fiscal years 1983 and 1984 but is partially offset by the growing
cost savings projected for the Social Security financing proposal.
Nevertheless, further cost reduction measures yet to be announced are
projected to amount to almost $30 billion in FY 1983 and over $40 billion
in FY 1984.
The major tax bill recently enacted by the Congress is estimated
to reduce revenues by amounts almost exactly matching those assumed in
the Mid-Session Review for fiscal year 1982, 1983, and 1984. The two
most important elements of the tax bill are across-the-board reductions
in personal income tax rates and a program for accelerated depreciation

Division of Research and Statistics.

which replaces the more complex "asset depreciation range" system pre-
viously in the tax code. The tax rate reductions in the personal income
tax account for $25.8 billion, $65.7 billion, and $104.5 billion of reve-
nue reduction in fiscal years 1982, 1983, and 1984, respectively, while
the accelerated depreciation provisions account for $9.6 billion, $16.8
billion and $26.3 billion in the three fiscal years.
The reductions in personal income tax rates are effected by reduc-
tions in withholding rates by 5 percent effective October 1, and addi-
tional 10 percent cuts on July 1, 1982 and July 1, 1983. Calendar year
liabilities are reduced by 1-1/4 percent in 1981, 10 percent in 1982,
19 percent in 1983 and 23 percent in 1984. Thereafter, the tax brackets,
zero bracket amount and personal exemptions are linked to movements in
the consumer price index. In addition:
the top marginal rate on unearned income is dropped
from 70 percent to 50 percent effective January 1,
1982 and the corresponding reduction, from 28 percent to
20 percent, in the maximum tax on capital gains is retro-
active to June 9, 1981;
two-earner households filing joint returns are permitted
to deduct 5 percent of the income of the spouse with lower
earnings, up to $1,500 in 1982 and 10 percent, up to
$3,000 thereafter;
the child care credit is liberalized (the maximum credit
for two or more dependents is raised from $4,000 to
$4,800);
charitable contributions (up to a cap, through 1984) are
made deductible even though a taxpayer does not itemize
deductions;
the roll-over period for reinvestment of gains on the sale
of a principal residence is lengthened to 2 years and the
amount of the one-time exclusion of gain for sellers aged
55 and above is raised from $100,000 to $125,000;
a few other minor provisions apply to Americans working
abroad, state legislators, etc.
The accelerated cost recovery system (effective January 1, 1981)
places depreciable property in 15-, 10-, 5-, or 3-year classes. Equip-
ment in these classes will be written off using rates that approximate
the 150 percent declining balance method. (Certain long-lived utility
property is the only equipment in the 15-year class.) The recovery rate
is increased to approximately 175 percent for property placed in service
in 1985 and to 200 percent beginning in 1986. For real estate, the
recovery period is 15 years and the recovery rate is approximately 175
percent of declining balances except for low-income housing for which

II-A-4
the rate is 200 percent. Assets in the 3-year class (primarily autos,
light-trucks and R and D equipment) receive a 6 percent investment tax
credit (more than previously) and equipment in the other classes receives
the full 10-percent credit. A liberalized leasing rule will permit firms
with low tax liabilities, and thus not able to use the full amount of
tax write-off were they to buy equipment, to lease the equipment from
firms that can take advantage of the tax benefits.
Other business tax provisions include the following:
liberalized credit for rehabilitation of structures;
a new 25 percent credit for incremental expenses
incurred for research and development;
immediate expensing of the first $5,000 of invest-
ment in equipment in 1982, this amount increasing
to $10,000 by 1986;
phased reduction of corporate tax rates for the
two lowest brackets (there is no change in the
46 percent rate paid on profits above $100,000
or the 30 and 40 percent rates for profits above
$50,000 and $75,000, respectively);
extension of the targeted jobs credit through
1982 with certain modifications;
for 1982 only, an increase in commercial bank
bad debt reserve to 1.0 percent of loans;
facilitation of "tax-free" mergers for thrift
institutions certified as troubled by the
appropriate regulatory agency; in particular,
operating losses of the transferor can be
carried over to the transferee so long as sub-
stantially all of the assets and liabilities
of the transferor are acquired by the transferee.
A number of other provisions are intended to stimulate saving and/
or assist the thrift and housing industries. These include:
provision for a lifetime exclusion of $1,000
($2,000 for a joint return) of interest from
"all savers certificates" if such certificates
are authorized by the regulatory agencies; "all
savers certificates" may be issued with a one-
year maturity and a maximum interest rate of 70
percent of the yield on a one-year Treasury bill,
between October 1, 1981 and December 30, 1982;
75 percent of the lesser of the proceeds of the

II-A-5
certificates or of net new savings must be devoted
to mortgage or mortgage related purposes or agri-
cultural loans;
the present $200 ($400 for joint return) exclusion
of interest and dividends reverts to the former
exclusion of $100 ($200 for joint return) of
dividends only. Beginning in 1985, however, 15
percent of interest (net of interest costs except
those associated with the taxpayer's business or
dwelling) up to $3,000 ($6,000 joint returns) is
excludable from tax;
IRA and Keogh account limitations are liberalized,
increasing the amounts of tax-deferred contribu-
tions and permitting individuals participating
in employer-sponsored retirement plans to utilize
IRA deductions.
Other provisions of the bill include:
estate and gift tax relief;
liberalization of the windfall profit tax through
credits for royalty owners, phased reduction of
the tax rate on new (Tier 3) oil and exemption
from the tax for oil from independently owned
"stripper" (lower production) wells beginning
in 1983;
tightened tax treatment of gains and losses on
trading in futures (straddles) requiring commo-
dities futures contracts to be "marked-to-market"
at year end and treated as if 60 percent of gains
and losses were long-term and 40 percent short-
term;
faster payment of taxes by large corporations as
quarterly payments are raised relative to annual
liabilities (primarily affecting fiscal year 1983
receipts).

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most interest rates have risen on balance since the July FOMC meet-
ing, with some of the largest increases occurring in the intermediate- and
long-term debt markets where many rates registered new highs before easing
in recent days. The bearishness of market sentiment--despite indications
of reduced inflationary momentum--appeared to reflect increased market
recognition of the implications of the Federal Reserve's restrictive mone-
tary policy in conjunction with intense concern about the dimensions of
current and prospective federal budget deficits.
The major exception to the upward movement of interest rates was the
federal funds rate, which fluctuated considerably, but generally in a range
below levels prevailing before the July FOMC meeting. The pattern of the
funds rate was consistent with the lower average volume of borrowing at the
discount window that emerged against a backdrop of slow growth of M1-B and
expansion of M2 which kept this broader aggregate running just below the
upper bound of its long-run target range for 1981.
In the credit markets, flows of funds in recent weeks have continued
to reflect the relative interest rate sensitivities of various sectors of
the economy. The Treasury, needing to cover a substantial third-quarter
deficit, has been a heavy borrower. In the tax-exempt sector, short-term
borrowing moderated in July, but the pace of bond issuance was well main-
tained. Business firms, in contrast, have been considerably deterred from
bond issuance by record rates; public offerings by industrial and financial
companies fell off substantially in July, as such firms turned instead to
banks and, in some instances, to the commercial paper market. Aggregate
borrowing by households appears to have diminished further, with high rates

reduce effective demands for houses and consumer durables.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Shift-adjusted M1-B expanded at a 3-1/4 percent annual rate in July,
after substantial declines in each of the two previous months. The staff
estimates that more than a third of the total increase in the daily average
level of this aggregate reflected the early distribution of social security
checks, which were augmented by the annual cost-of-living adjustment. Other
checkable deposits rose $2 billion after a net decrease of $1/4 billion in
the preceding two months; in the absence of new evidence on shift propor-
tions, the staff in its adjustment of M1-B has continued to assume that 70
to 75 percent of the net inflow of other checkable deposits (above trend)
is from demand deposits.
Growth in M2 picked up in July from the relatively sluggish pace of
the previous two months. The 8-1/2 percent annual rate of expansion of
M2 reflected in part stepped-up growth in its nontransaction component.
Faster expansion of money market mutual fund (MMMF) shares and a deceler-
ation in savings deposit outflows more than offset slower growth in small
time deposits and a decline in the overnight RP and Eurodollar component.
MMMF shares increased $11-1/2 billion during July, on a month-aver-
age basis, more than double the increase in June. MMMF growth during the
first week of August continued at about the July pace. The persistence of
a large spread between money fund yields and returns available on consumer-
type time deposits at commercial banks and thrift institutions helps to
explain the rapid inflows into MMMFs as well as the weakness in small time
deposit growth at depository institutions. During July, the margin between

the weekly average yield on MMMF shares and the deposit rate ceiling on
MMCs increased to 175 basis points.
Some savers also have been placing their funds in retail repurchase
agreements (term RPs with denominations of less than $100,000) rather than
in conventional deposit instruments. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board in
February approved the offering of retail RPs; since then, a number of S&Ls
have reportedly marketed them actively to attract and retain funds, while
a recent survey by the bank contact group indicates that commercial bank
participation is, to date, quite limited. Offering terms vary widely, but
RPs typically are issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 to $2,500 with
maturities of 30 to 89 days. An estimate of retail term RPs at S&Ls is
included in M3--along with large-denomination thrift and bank RPs--but not
in M2.
Bank issuance of large time deposits (line 24 in the table on page
III-4) increased a bit in July, but after allowance for estimated CD acqui-
sition by MMMFs, the bank large time deposit component of M3 grew less
rapidly than in June (line 20).1 S&Ls meanwhile ran off a small amount of
large time deposits in July; investor concerns about the financial position
of thrift institutions have resulted in unusually large premiums that even
the strongest S&Ls must pay relative to rates paid on large CDs by commer-
cial banks.
At commercial banks, overall issuance of managed liabilities slowed in
July; their need to purchase funds was reduced as U.S. government deposits
1. Data on MMMF asset composition currently are available only with about
a one-month lag. Consequently, the necessary consolidation adjustments in
calculating M2 must be regarded as tentative and subject to considerable
uncertainty. Efforts are underway, with the cooperation of the Investment
Company Institute, to improve the data flow in this area.

increased slightly after dropping appreciably in the preceding month. U.S.
banks maintained an essentially unchanged position vis-a-vis their own for-
eign branches; in June they had advanced funds, net, to their branches,
raising money in the domestic money market. The reduction in managed lia-
bility growth was more than accounted for by a swing from net issuance to
net repayment of "other" nondeposit liabilities to nonbank sources--mainly
RPs.
Bank credit advanced in July at only a 5 percent annual rate, the
weakest pace since April. Net acquisitions of U.S. government securities
slowed significantly as large banks reduced their holdings of securities
for trading account. Total loan growth also edged down. The only source
of strength in bank credit came from a sizable increase in business loans,
which was concentrated at large banks. Security loans fell in July, follow-
ing five months of strength, as dealer holdings of U.S. government securi-
ties decreased. Real estate lending--although up somewhat from the June
pace--remained relatively weak.
Business Finance
Available data suggest that overall credit demands by nonfinancial
business firms have moderated somewhat in July from the levels in May and
June. Borrowing nevertheless remained quite substantial as weak corporate
profitability has limited the availability of internally generated funds.
In shorter-term markets, a step-up in business borrowing at banks was more
than offset by a virtual levelling off in the volume of nonfinancial com-
mercial paper outstanding, even though the margin between the prime rate
and the commercial paper rate remained wide. The deceleration in nonfinan-
cial commercial paper reportedly reflected in part a reduction in issues by

oil companies, whose inventories were declining. By contrast, total com-
mercial paper outstanding rose significantly, resulting to some extent
from further expansion in inventory financing requirements at auto company
finance subsidiaries as well as a large increase in bank-related issues, a
portion of which reportedly was channeled to nonbank affiliates to finance
business credit.
Business lending by U.S. commercial banks in July was affected only
marginally by takedowns of lines of credit associated with merger activi-
ties. Although U.S. banks are participating in a large volume of merger-
related C&I loan commitments, most of the relatively small amount taken
down by the end of July was booked offshore.1 Thus, it appears that about
1-1/2 percentage points of the 17-1/2 percent July increase in C&I loans
(excluding bankers acceptances) at domestic bank offices was merger-related.
In the securities markets, yields on corporate bonds rose about 1-3/4
percentage points between early July and early August, reaching record
highs. During July, the volume of public bond offerings dropped to $1.5
billion (seasonally adjusted)-about half the average during the previous
few months. The decline in offerings appears to reflect the sharp rise in
long-term yields and the expectation of more favorable market conditions
later this year. All of the fall-off in July was in the industrial and
the financial sectors, as offerings by utilities remained at a $1.1 bil-
lion per month pace. Foreign bond issuance--not included in totals cited
above--has been quite buoyant. Such offerings have averaged about $530
million per month through July, well above the record rate set in 1975.
1. Recent merger-related activity and its effect on measures of business
lending are discussed in more detail in an appendix.

III-10
Less than half of this amount can be attributed directly to borrowing by
foreign governments.
Private placements of corporate bonds have remained sluggish. Ac-
cording to market observers, many potential issuers of privately placed
debt have been unwilling to incur the high costs of borrowing. However,
the available data suggest that liquidity pressures on the life insurance
industry may also be a factor; policy loans outstanding have advanced at
a strong pace through May (latest available), and commercial paper issu-
ance by life insurance companies also has increased in recent months.
Share prices generally have increased, on balance, during the inter-
meeting period. The NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX composite indexes all have
risen approximately 2 to 4 percent since early July. New stock issues
totaled $1.7 billion (seasonally adjusted) in July, down about $500 mil-
lion from the strong first-half monthly average.
Government Finance
The Treasury during July and thus far in August has raised, net, about
$10 billion (not seasonally adjusted) through marketable borrowing, in con-
trast to a slight paydown in debt in the second quarter as a whole. In the
recent mid-quarter financing, the Treasury paid record high rates on each
of the three issues involved, a reflection of the generally anxious tone
of fixed-income markets. However, the auctions were well-covered, and the
volume of noncompetitive tenders was the largest on record, suggesting a
possible diversion of some funds from deposits or MMMFs into market instru-
ments. Noncompetitive tenders also have been running high in auctions of
of bills and other securities.

The Board staff projects a combined unified and off-budget federal
deficit of $18-1/2 billion for the current quarter. To finance the defi-
cit, Treasury borrowing in the market may be close to $17 billion.1 In
the fourth quarter, the staff expects a record combined deficit of $47
billion, partly reflecting reduced revenues as a result of the tax cut, and
marketable borrowing by the Treasury of $37 billion--even larger than the
fourth-quarter borrowing expectations announced by the Treasury to date.
Federally sponsored credit agencies borrowed an estimated $4.7 bil-
lion in July, eclipsing the strong $3.2 billion monthly pace of the second
quarter. The FHLB raised $2.4 billion in new money in July, mainly because
advances to S&Ls and MSBs have expanded rapidly as thrifts have become
increasingly dependent on borrowing due to the persistent weakness in their
deposit flows. FHLB advances in July totaled a near-record $3.1 billion
after seasonal adjustment, up from $2.5 billion in June. The rise in
advances occurred despite the FHLBB's adoption of a tighter policy in June
1981 to restrict the use of advances to funding of net deposit withdrawals
and existing loan commitments.
The Farm Credit Banks borrowed $1.4 billion in July, somewhat above
the second quarter pace; however, borrowings by this agency in August are
expected to be much reduced. Meanwhile, FNMA is estimated to have borrowed
$524 million in July, considerably more than the monthly average during
the second quarter, reflecting a moderate recovery in mortgage purchases.
Yields on FNMA debentures have increased to as much as 140 basis points

will act by the end of September to raise the debt ceiling from its cur-
rent level of $985 billion.

Yields in the long-term tax-exempt securities market have risen to
record levels since the last FOMC meeting, maintaining a roughly stable
relationship to corporate bond rates. Despite the high rates, municipal
bond volume totaled $3.3 billion (seasonally adjusted) in July--down $200
million from the amount sold in June but considerably above the 1979-80
pace of offerings exclusive of mortgage revenue bond issues. The supply
of municipal issues has been sustained in part because some states have
removed or increased their statutory interest rate ceilings that had
thwarted previous attempts to sell securities. In addition, issues of
revenue bonds, which currently account for about 70 percent of tax-exempt
volume, typically are less sensitive to high interest costs, especially
in the case of utilities faced with rigid annual funding needs and sched-
uled payments for construction that is underway. In July, postponements
of municipal bonds of all types totaled about $525 million, slightly above
the monthly average for all of 1981 but less than half the amount post-
poned when municipal bond interest rates peaked in December 1980.

III-15
Mortgage Markets
Costs of both construction and permanent mortgage funds have risen
further since the last FOMC meeting. In the primary market for long-term
mortgage credit, interest rates have reached new highs on fixed-rate level-
payment conventional home loans at a sample of savings and loan associa-
tions; they averaged 17.13 percent in the week ended August 7, up nearly
1/2 percentage point since early July. Yield increases were much larger
in the secondary mortgage market, prior to the recent rally in the bond
market. As a result, average discounts on FHA/VA level-payment home mort-
gages bearing the current 15-1/2 percent ceiling rate have risen to a level
that has discouraged transactions financed with this type of credit.
Average rates paid by consumers on all types of conventional home
loans closed at major types of institutions (FHLBB series) have been well
well below rates quoted on new commitments for unsubsidized fixed-rate
loans. This gap is attributable partly to the usual lag between commitment
and closing rates, but also reflects the presence in the loans-closed series
of below-market-rate contracts funded through municipal revenue bonds as
well as mortgages with adjustable-rate features which are being offered at
initial interest rates below those prevailing on fixed-rate contracts. In
addition, field reports continue to indicate wide use of builder buydown
arrangements and "creative" seller financing in existing-home markets to
enable buyers to soften the impact of high interest rates in the early years
of a loan.1,2
1. Nontraditional financing techniques also have become a feature of the
markets for income-producing real estate. About 30 percent of a limited
number of large mortgage loan commitments made by reporting life insurance
companies on income properties during the first quarter of 1981 (latest
data available) provided for income or equity sharing by lenders or for
renegotiated rates. The proportion by dollar volume was two-thirds.
2. Rates reported by lenders for first mortgages in the closing rate
series are not affected by builder buydown arrangements.

III-16
The problem of sorting through the variety of adjustable-rate
mortgage arrangements permitted by the recent regulations issued by the
FHLBB and the Comptroller of the Currency apparently has caused some delays
in marketing these types of contracts. FHLMC recently established weekly
auctions of commitments to purchase adjustable-rate mortgages--conventional
home loans providing for adjustments to interest rates (and monthly pay-
ments) once a year on the basis of movements in average rates on mortgage
loans closed. The volume of bids in the first four auctions was quite low,
and average initial yields on accepted bids in these pilot programs ranged
from 66 to 103 basis points below yields set in FHLMC's auctions of commit-
ments to purchase fixed-rate loans--roughly the degree of yield concession
indicated in field reports.
The volume of residential mortgage lending has continued to be
restrained by the high level of interest rates and by conservative lend-
ing policies. New mortgage commitments at S&Ls in June (latest informa-
tion available) fell by 11 percent, seasonally adjusted, to about half
the volume made at last August's high. Mortgage commitments outstanding
(including loans in process) also declined, and in nominal terms were
about 12 percent below the recent peak reached in the fall of 1980; never-
theless, they were well above their 1980 monthly low.
With home sales dwindling and a rising share of sales apparently
being funded through assumptions of outstanding loans in connection with
some form of seller financing, the rate of turnover of mortgages held by
S&Ls has dropped further, thus contributing to the earnings difficulties
experienced by these institutions. In June, mortgage repayments at S&Ls
fell to $2.5 billion (seasonally adjusted)-the lowest volume since June

III-17
1980 and far below the peaks of $5 billion or more in 1978 when existing-
home sales reached their highs.
Consumer Installment Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit outstanding during July pro-
bably remained sluggish, judging from indications of continued weakness in
consumer loans at large commercial banks and still depressed new-car sales.
Installment credit growth had picked up slightly in June on the strength
of a sharp advance in the revolving credit component, but the second-quar-
ter expansion, at a 7 percent annual rate, trailed the first quarter tempo
by a small margin.
Automobile credit outstanding remained weak in June, increasing
marginally after a small contraction during May. In a renewed effort to
stimulate car sales, General Motors announced in late July that its
finance company subsidiary would finance the purchase of a new GM car at
a below-market rate of 13.8 percent.1 Chrysler followed in early August
with an announcement of cash rebates for any purchaser of a new Chrysler
car, while Ford and AMC have been providing allowances that dealers can
pass along to buyers as price concessions, lower downpayments, or interest
rate subsidies.
In June, new-car finance rates at finance companies rose 90 basis
points to a record 16.97 percent. (See chart on page II-20.) Despite
the GM focus on interest rates in its sales campaign, financing costs
have not been the primary factor underlying the sharp increase in average
monthly loan payments since the end of 1979. Staff estimates show that
1. Compared with the average level of auto finance rates at finance com-
panies, the new GM offer rate represents a 3 percentage point discount.
On a typical amount financed of $7,500 for 48 months, the total payment
over the life of the loan would be reduced $580, or $12 per month.

typical new-car monthly payments have risen in the interim by more than
$40 (to over $200), with higher car prices contributing at least three-
fourths of the increase and higher interest rates accounting for the rest.
At commercial banks, consumer finance rates also have risen to
record levels for all major loan types. In May (latest data available),
rates on personal loans averaged 150 basis points above the previous peak
in May of last year. Recent actions suggest that consumer rates were still
moving up in early August. Citibank, for example, increased rates to 20
percent from 18 percent for both secured installment loans and revolving
credit plans, unless the borrower is a "full relationship" customer of the
bank.
Personal bankruptcies, which soared during 1980, have leveled off
since the fourth quarter. Although the monthly figures have been volatile,
and June bankruptcy filings were up substantially from May, the second
quarter total (seasonally adjusted) was 2 percent below the 1980-Q4 high.

Appendix*
MERGER-RELATED LOANS AND THEIR EFFECT ON BUSINESS CREDIT MEASURES
This appendix discusses lines of credit associated with the recent
spate of corporate takeovers and corresponding business loan activity.
While the aggregate amount of recently announced merger-related lines of
credit involving participation by U.S. chartered banking entities is
approximately $41 billion, the effect on domestic bank credit has been
relatively small through July.1 The actual amount of publicly announced
loans for these purposes included in the bank credit statistics is estima-
ted to be roughly $1.8 billion during the first half of the year. In July,
loans made by U.S. banking offices against merger-related lines of credit
amounted to approximately $850 million. This included a small portion of
the $6 billion loan to Mobil; just over $5 billion of the loan was booked
at foreign banks or foreign offices of U.S. banks. These merger-related
loans, at roughly $2.6 billion through July, account for about 14 percent
of the increase in total business loans made by U.S. banking offices (SA
monthly averages of Wednesday data) of approximately $18.5 billion between
December 1980 and July 1981. Loans for August likely will reflect some
portion of the recent $3.8 billion takedown by DuPont--at least half of
which, it is suspected, will be funded by foreign banks, but the final
booking of the transaction has not been learned.
Table 1 summarizes major U.S. and Canadian lines of credit associa-
ted with recent merger activity. Of the roughly $41 billion of U.S. lines
listed, U.S. banking syndicates (where known) are estimated to account
for about one-half of the total credit lines for which information on par-
ticipation is available. Commitments associated with the bids for Conoco
total roughly $13.5 billion.
To obtain additional information on U.S. bank participation in mer-
ger-related credit commitments, Reserve Bank staff talked with loan offi-
cers at nine large banks in late July; information on another bank had
been collected independently by the New York Bank staff. In the aggregate,
the banks contacted indicated a recent increase in their volume of merger-
related commitments of more than $10 billion.3 Although most banks did
not expect all the lines to be actually drawn down for merger-related
purposes, they indicated that the lines also were available for general
corporate purposes. Most banks reported that they would fund any draw-
downs through "nrmal" channels--specifically citing CDs and federal funds--
and did not expect to limit credit to other customers. The respondents

Section, with contributions from Margaret Pickering, Economist, Capital
Markets Section, all of the Division of Research and Statistics.
1. In addition, nearly $7 billion of Canadian lines are known to have been
established recently primarily for foreign takeovers of foreign subsidi-
aries of U.S. concerns.

been repaid.
3. "Recent" was undefined in the survey; the respondents interpreted

III-A-2
confirmed substantial foreign participation with estimates of 25 percent
to "at least half" being the non-U.S. banks' share. Eight banks indicated
that U.S. banking laws limiting the amount of loans made to a single cus-
tomer did constrain their participation in these large lines of credit.
The commitments provide for loans with maturities on the order of
7 to 12 years. Typically, for the first 4 years of the commitment, loans
loans may be drawn down under a revolving facility--allowing loans out-
standing to fluctuate without penalty-after which they convert to term
loans. Under most commitments, loans can be drawn down at either prime-
or LIBOR-based rates at the option of the borrower.1 Some of the commi-
ments provide for an increase in the mark-up over the base rate when the
term loan provision becomes effective.
Table 2 lists publicly announced loans made through July in connec-
tion with large merger-related transactions.2 Of the roughly $5.3 bil-
lion of borrowings listed, loans extended for the Fluor-St. Joe merger
and for the Mobil bid for Conoco account for about $3 billion. For the
following reasons, it is estimated that only about $2.6 billion of the
$5.3 billion is included in U.S. commercial bank loan statistics:
-About $1.25 billion of the Mobil loan reportedly is booked at
foreign branches of U.S. banks and is not included in bank
credit as usually defined.
-One large New York bank reportedly is booking large loans at
nonbank subsidiaries of the holding company parent. In table
2, approximately $425 million in loans fall in this category.
-One New York investment firm, formed at the beginning of this
year, apparently specializes in "leveraged buy-outs" in which
the investment firm is the nominal purchaser but the actual
transaction is financed by large institutional investors, whose
identity generally is not announced. This firm has completed
$750 million of such transactions this year, but the amount of
its bank borrowings is unknown.
In a fundamental sense, merger financing should have no signifi-
cant macroeconomic impact. The transactions do not represent a call on
on the savings of the economy, since what is involved is the transfer of
existing assets. The proceeds from stock sales will be reinvested, with
some of these funds finding their way into bank liabilities, thereby
providing banks with loanable funds. Funds may also be directed into
other fixed-income securities or reinvested in equities, in the process
satisfying financing demands that might otherwise be placed on banks.
1. All respondents mentioned commitment fees of 1/4 or 3/8 of a percent
on the unused lines; only one requires "some" compensating balances.
2. One transaction for the buy-back of a company's own common shares
from another company was included because of its size and defensive
nature.

III-A-3
Many of the mergers that occurred earlier in the year were effected
through exchanges of stocks, and do not involve credit markets at all.
In the short-run, however, it is possible that merger-related fin-
ancing could affect the price and availability of credit. Liquidity and
capital considerations could cause those banks extending large sums to
finance merger activities to reduce their lending to others. As the
proceeds of the stock purchases are invested, temporary imbalances could
emerge in some markets. Such imbalances--which would tend to be accompan-
ied by changes in rate relationships--likely would be temporary as asset
holders shifted funds to those markets with relatively high yields.
It is also possible that, especially in the short run, the behavior
of the monetary aggregates--most likely the broader measures, M2 and M3-
could be boosted by the financial flows involved in mergers. To the
extent that the Federal Reserve does not accommodate the resulting move-
ments in the aggregates, interest rate pressures could result, with bor-
rowing for other purposes perhaps being crowded out to some small degree.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The dollar's weighted-average foreign exchange value has increased
by 4-1/2 percent since the time of the last Greenbook at the beginning
of July, reaching its highest level in nearly a decade. The dollar has
appreciated relative to all major foreign currencies over the past six
weeks, rising by about 5 percent against the EMS currencies and the
pound and firming by about 2 percent against the yen and Canadian dollar.
The dollar started to move sharply higher in the last week in
July and the dollar remained under strong upward pressure on the ex-
change markets in early August before easing back partially in recent
days. This rise was apparently triggered by Congressional action on
the President's tax cut proposals which, along with Treasury announce-
ments of heavy borrowing requirements for the remainder of the year,
convinced many market participants that U.S. interest rates would remain
high. In addition, the inability of a number of European governments
to reach political agreement on economic stabilization measures was
contrasted unfavorably with the situation in the United States. This
market perception of relative instability in Europe was heightened by
renewed unrest in Poland.

U.K. short-term
interest rates have increased by 1-3/4 percentage points over this
period. In contrast, Swiss and French interest rates have eased and
interest rates in Germany and Japan have remained unchanged. As shown
in the chart on the opposite page, average foreign short-term interest
rates remain about 4 percentage points below comparable U.S. rates,
little changed from the differential that prevailed at the time of the
last Greenbook.
Strains within the European Monetary System intensified in the
second week of August, with both the French and Belgian francs falling
to near their lower limits relative to the mark. The speculative
pressure on the French currency which had been touched off by the May
elections had abated temporarily after the newly elected Socialist gov-
ernment sharply raised interest rates and tightened exchange controls.
However, strong downward pressure on the French franc re-emerged in
August because of speculation that the franc would soon be devalued
relative to the other EMS currencies.
The further appreciation of the dollar and prospective high U.S.
interest rates contributed to a further decline in the dollar price of
gold to below the $400 level. In recent days, gold has recovered to
$412, about 3 percent below its level at the beginning of July.

U.S. Merchandise Trade. Despite a small dip in the June
merchandise trade deficit, the second-quarter deficit was almost $10
billion greater at an annual rate than in the first quarter. The
increase in the second quarter resulted from a 1 percent decline in
exports and 2-1/2 percent rise in imports.
A drop in the value of agricultural exports more than accounted
for the total second-quarter export change. However, the value of
agricultural exports in the first half of this year was well ahead of
levels reached last year. Much of the higher level of agricultural

exports early this year resulted from changes in prices; export prices
of most agricultural commodities peaked in the first quarter, but by
June had returned to, or fallen below, 1980 year-end levels. The quantity
of agricultural goods exported in the first half of 1981 was marginally
higher than during either half of last year.
The value of nonagricultural exports increased in the second
quarter largely because rises in automotive equipment to Canada, and in
machinery and civilian aircraft, exceeded declines in exports of more
price and cyclically sensitive industrial supplies. The increase in
machinery exports continued the steady upward movement that began in
1979 and the increase was widespread among the various types of machinery.
The higher values during the past two years resulted largely from rising
prices. The rise in civilian aircraft exports reflected primarily an
increase in the number of planes delivered to OPEC countries as well as
to the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan. Second-quarter industrial
supplies exports dropped back to levels of the second-half 1980 after
a moderate increase in the first quarter. The fall-off in coal exports
because of the strike accounted for about one-third of the decline.
Export declines were also recorded in metals and chemicals.
On the import side, most of the second-quarter rise was in items
other than oil, particularly in steel and automotive products from
Canada. The rise in steel imports was by far the largest single increase,
and was primarily in the volume of pipe products and sheet steel. Average
steel import prices changed only marginally between the first and second
quarters, rising by less than 1 percent. Automotive imports from Canada
are primarily vehicles assembled under the U.S.-Canadian automotive

IV -6
agreement, and the rise in these imports offset increased second-
quarter exports of automotive parts to Canada. The value of foreign
car and truck sales was about 4 percent above the first quarter rate.
The gradual increase in the value of foreign car imports since the
fourth quarter of 1980 is attributable to rising prices; the number of
units imported declined in both the first and second quarters of this
year. Foreign car sales exceeded imports in the first quarter, resulting
in a decline in dealers' inventories, but stocks changed little in the
second quarter as sales declined. Partly offsetting the increase in
steel and automotive imports were declines in foods (due to lower coffe
and sugar prices) and natural gas from Canada.
The small rise in oil imports in the second quarter was accounted
for entirely by higher prices. While import prices peaked in April,
the average for the quarter was about $1 per barrel above the first
quarter level. The average OPEC price has dropped about 2 percent since
the beginning of the year as falling demand has reduced sales by high-
price countries. At the same time, the Saudis have maintained a high
output rate at lower prices. OPEC has scheduled a meeting for August 19
in Geneva to discuss a possible price/production compromise. The volume
of oil imported in the second quarter was down marginally from the first-
quarter average rate, with sharp month-to-month fluctuations.

The new inflow in late July also appears to have been related to
the take down of a $6 billion loan by the Mobil Oil Corporation. A
large majority of the 22 foreign-based banks and 19 U.S.-based banks
that participated in the syndication apparently booked the loans at
foreign offices. Loans to U.S. nonbank residents from foreign offices

IV -8
of U.S. banks increased sharply at the time of the Mobil takedown, as
reflected in the daily average figure for the last week of July that
is shown in the above table. The proceeds of the loans were apparently
placed in overnight Eurodollars, which the U.S. banking offices may then
have repatriated.
Total Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbanks, which had grown
relatively slowly during 1980, have surged during the first five months
of this year. As shown in the table below, the $17 billion increase this
year has been evenly divided between holdings of negotiable CDs and
holdings of nonnegotiable time deposits. Money market funds and short-
term unit investment trusts accounted for about three-quarters of the
increase in holdings of CDs. The money market funds continue to hold
about 10 percent of their portfolios in these instruments. While the
bulk of the total increase has been placed with foreign offices of U.S.
banks, the table shows that U.S. nonbank residents have also been
increasing their Eurodollar holdings at foreign offices of foreign banks.

Intervention sales of dollars by foreign countries accelerated in
July and the first week of August. OPEC inflows, which had totalled
about $7.5 billion during the first four months of the year, slowed
considerably, beginning in May. In the May-July period they are
estimated to have totalled only $1.1 billion. The reduction in OPEC
inflows is partly a result of the sharp decline in the OPEC current
account surplus, which begin in late 1980. In addition, large reductions
in Libyan holdings were apparently related to the expulsion of its
diplomats from the United States in May. As a whole, foreign reserve
assets in the United States increased $1.4 billion in June and decreased
as estimated $2.6 billion in July,

IV -10
Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity has continued
to be weak in the major foreign industrial economies. Although Japan
and Germany experienced fairly strong real GNP growth in the first
quarter of 1981, preliminary indications are that activity moderated
considerably in the second quarter. Latest production data for France
indicate further weakness in the second quarter following a decline
in real GDP of some 4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter. It
appears that economic activity in the United Kingdom has stopped
declining, but there are few signs of an upturn in activity. In
Canada, which has experienced rather buoyant GNP growth in recent
quarters, there are some signs of a weakening in economic activity.
In France and Japan wholesale price inflation increased in the
second quarter, while in Germany wholesale price inflation declined
in the second quarter from the high rate recorded in the first
quarter of this year. Except for the United Kingdom, there was little
change in the rate of increase of consumer prices in the major
foreign industrial countries in the second quarter. U.K. inflation
rates were increased substantially by changes in various indirect
taxes and public charges.
During the course of the first half of this year, there has
been a strengthening of the trade balances for the three largest
foreign industrial economies: Japan, Germany, and France. The
Canadian trade surplus, reflecting in part the relatively strong rate
of growth of Canadian demand, declined in the second quarter.

IV -11
Macroeconomic policy generally has remained restrictive in the
major foreign industrial countries, with emphasis being placed on reducing
price inflation. Recently, the German government began the process of
cutting back on its spending and borrowing plans for 1982. A notable
exception to this general pattern is in France, where the new government
has switched to expansionary fiscal and monetary policy intended to
reduce unemployment.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, economic growth continued to
be sluggish. Industrial production (s.a. revived in June from its sharp
May decline, but the second-quarter average was below that of the preceeding
quarter and only slightly above that of a year ago. Growth in personal
consumption has picked up, but full-scale revival of demand in that
sector has not yet materialized. Plant and equipment investment in
large companies remains fairly robust, but in smaller firms it has been
sluggish, and housing investment continues to be weak. The main sources
of demand strength appear to be public works expenditure and exports.
The price situation in Japan continues to be favorable, but there
is concern over the. effect of recent weakness in the yen on domestic
prices. The WPI moved upward again in July, for the fourth consecutive
month following several months of decline earlier in the year. Since
March the WPI has been advancing at about a 6-1/2 percent annual rate.
Consumer prices fell in July, making the rate of advance of the CPI
between the 3-month period ending in April and July about 4-1/2 percent
(a.r.).
The current-account surplus widened in June to about $900 million
(s.a.) bringing the total surplus for the first half to about $1.3 billion.

IV -15
Deterioration in the services account in June was more than offset by
a sharp decline in imports, related mainly to weaker activity in the
domestic economy.
Both long-term and short-term interest rates in Japan rose somewhat
in June, partly under the influence of increased U.S. rates, causing
difficulties for the issuance of new government debt to the financial
syndicate. The July issue was cancelled. In mid-July the Bank of Japan
announced its projection of 9-10 percent year-over-year M2 growth for
the third quarter, well above the second-quarter's roughly 7-3/4 percent
rate.
After unexpectedly strong real GNP growth in Germany in the first
quarter, preliminary indications point to a flat second quarter. Industrial
production, which by May was about 6 percent above its low point at
the end of last year, fell by nearly 4 percent in June. The rate of
unemployment continued its steady climb in July, when it reached 5.6 percent
(s.a.) a level exceeding the peak of the unemployment rate in the 1975
recession. With the overall situation thus continuing to be weak, there
have been two sources of relative strength: the volume of exports rose
by over 5 percent, while imports have grown more slowly. Second, government
consumption has been much higher than anticipated, growing by 5 percent
in the first quarter.
The rate of consumer price inflation has been just below 5 percent
annual rate for the last 3 months including July. The June current-account
deficit of $1.6 billion has pushed the cumulative 1981 deficit to
$6.7 billion, well above the comparable 1980 result. However, the
cumulative trade balance this year has significantly improved over last
year's result.

In June the growth of Central Bank Money, the Bundesbank's target
variable, continued to grow in the middle of the 4 to 7 percent target
range. The Bundesbank recently has announced its intention to slow CBM
growth toward the lower part of its target range.
With monetary policy on a restrictive course, the fiscal sector has
so far been more expansionary than anticipated, with the growth of federal
spending expected to reach 7 percent this year as opposed to the originally
planned 4 percent. This will mean net federal borrowing this year of at
least DM 34 billion as opposed to the DM 27 billion originally planned.
In order to trim back.an anticipated further rise of this figure to over
DM 40 billion next year, the government is currently undertaking a major
effort to control its 1982 budget. So far, the Finance Minister has
proposed cuts of DM 14 billion (almost 1 percent of nominal GNP). Details
are not yet known except that growth in defense spending will be limited
to 4.2 percent in nominal terms -a cut of about 1 percent in real terms.
(The budget process for 1982 is in its beginning stage. The coalition
government's official budget submission will take place in September.)
French industrial production in April and May averaged nearly 3/4
of a percent below the previous quarter and was over 8 percent below the
figure for a year ago. Recent surveys indicate little if any improvement
since May. In a June survey, demand indicators seemed to have shown a
slight deterioration from the previous two months; however, foreign demand
in some areas showed improvement. The same survey indicated that private
real investment in 1981 may fall by 12 percent. Consumer demand for
industrial products in June reached its highest level since January,
and for the second quarter was about 1-1/2 percent above the first quarter.

IV -17
In the second quarter, consumer price inflation accelerated to 14
percent (a.r.) from 12-1/2 percent the previous quarter and from an
average 13-1/2 percent in 1980 .Wholesale prices accelerated in the
second quarter as well. For the first half of 1981 the French trade
deficit was under $10 billion (s.a.a.r.) compared with a deficit of over
$14 billion last year. In June the trade deficit increased to about
$1 billion which was below the January deficit but above those recorded
in the interceding months.
In the 5 months to May of this year, M2 has grown by roughly 18 per-
cent (s.a.a.r.). Last year's growth and the previous government's target
for this year (not yet officially renounced or replaced by the present
government) were 10 percent. The relaxation of the credit controls
announced in June is to be broadened and extended through August. The
Bank of France has continued to lower the various rates at which it
provides refinancing to the banking system and market interest rates have
fallen. Preliminary announcements indicate that the 1982 budget deficit
will be around FF 100 billion (2-1/2 percent of GDP) compared with a fore-
cast deficit of FF 70 billion (2 percent of GDP) for 1981.
The Socialist government has announced that a nationalization bill
covering industrial companies and banks without significant foreign owner-
ship will be presented by September 15, to be voted on by October 4.
In the United Kingdom, according to preliminary data, real personal
consumption expenditures fell about 1-1/2 percent (s.a.) between the first
and second quarters of 1981. Nevertheless, personal consumption so far
this year is still 1 percent (sa.) greater than it was in the second
half of 1980; the decline recorded this year in real personal disposable

IV -18
income has been offset by a lowering of the personal saving rate. In-
dustrial production rose nearly 1-1/2 percent (s.a.). in June 1981. So far
this year the industrial production index essentially has been flat at a
level about 3 percent (s.a.) below that prevailing in the second half of
1980. The rapid rundown in inventories that took place last year contin-
ued in the first quarter, but at a rate somewhat less than the extra-
ordinarily high rate recorded in the final quarter of 1980.
The recent weakness of the pound sterling has led to an increase
in the rate of growth of wholesale prices -- particularly those for in-
puts purchased by manufacturing industry, which rose 1-1/2 percent in
June and 25 percent (a.r.) in the 6-month period ending in June -- but
has not yet had a perceptible impact on consumer prices. In the 6 months
to May 1981, average earnings rose 8 percent (s.a.a.r.) while consumer
prices increased 15 percent (a.r.), which implies a sharp fall in real
wages so far this year. Of the 15 percent (a.r.) increase in consumer
prices recorded so far this year (December 1980 to June 1981), perhaps
5 percentage points can be attributed to increases in various indirect
taxes and public charges in March and April. In reaction to the weakness
of sterling -- particularly its weakness against the dollar -- and the
acceleration of inflation in recent months, the Bank of England has taken
steps to raise U.K. interest rates.
On August 5, the Bank of England announced some changes in its
system of monetary control. The changes, which have been discussed
publicly for several months, are intended to allow the market more scope
in the determination of interest rates. As of August 20, the Bank's Min-
imum Lending Rate will no longer be published regularly and the Bank
primarily will use open market operations to keep short-term interest

IV -19
rates within an unpublished band. In addition, the liquid-asset-ratio
requirement will be abolished and the required cash-reserve ratio will be
lowered from 1-1/2 percent to 1/2 percent and extended to include all
U.K. banks. As a part of the changes in the monetary system, the sta-
tistical coverage of the U.K. monetary aggregates will be enlarged, re-
sulting in an expected once-and-for-all increase of some £8 billion in
sterling M3 (13 percent). The Bank of England also has extended the
list of "eligible" banks to include some foreign banks. The acceptances
of an eligible bank are eligible for discount at the Bank of England; in
return for this privilege, each eligible bank must have a certain amount
of funds on deposit with the London discount houses and/or similar insti-
tutions.
Real growth in Canada appears to have slowed in the second quarter
of this year. Industrial production (s.a.) fell slightly in May after
rising about 1-1/2 percent and 1 percent in March and April, respectively.
Unemployment in June rose to 7.3 percent from 7.1 percent in May and 7.0
percent in April. There was little change in Canadian inflation rates in
the second quarter. The Canadian trade surplus for the second quarter
was almost $900 million (s.a.), down from $1.5 billion in the first
quarter.
The Canadian dollar has weakened markedly against the U.S. dollar.
In response to this depreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Bank of
Canada has raised short-term interest rates in recent weeks, and on July
29, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Allan MacEachen announced
that he had requested Canadian banks and a number of major foreign banks
to reduce substantially the amount of their lending in which the proceeds

IV -20
are converted to foreign currency and used to finance takeovers. The
government believes that such transactions have contributed to the recent
downward pressure on the exchange value of the Canadian dollar. Mr.
MacEachen also gave his assurance that the Canadian government has no
intention of imposing mandatory foreign exchange controls.
In Italy, some signs of economic weakness have appeared in recent
months. After declining slightly in April, industrial production fell
by almost 6 percent (s.a.) in May to a level about 3 percent below that
of May 1980. A leading indicator series was negative in April for the
first time since last fall, while business surveys in May showed a sharp
deterioration in orders and expected production levels. Consumer prices
in June and July rose by almost 1 percent (n.s.a.); during the 3-month
period ending in July, consumer prices rose by 15 percent (a.r.) over
the preceding 3 months. In June the trade deficit narrowed to about
$1,4 billion compared with $1.8 billion in May. June's deficit was
smaller in part as a result of the imposition in late May of a 30 percent
prior deposit requirement on imports.
The new Spadolini government approved proposals to reduce the pub-
lic sector deficit that has been running over 30 percent above the tar-
get set last fall. More than half of the $6-1/2 billion cut in spending
during 1981 was achieved by deferring planned projects. Since capital
spending is often delayed by bureaucratic inefficiency, these cuts may
not result in a deficit lower than would have otherwise occurred.
Another recent development was an accord reached between the Treasury and
the Bank of Italy, in which the Bank will no longer be obligated to

IV -21
absorb Treasury paper not purchased by the market. In view of the large
volume of Treasury debt to be rolled over and the continuing large budget
deficits, it is unclear how independent monetary policy will be notwith-
standing this accord.
In the Benelux countries preliminary data indicate that real
economic activity has not yet begun to recover. In the Netherlands in-
dustrial production (s.a.) fell again in May and has been below its May
1980 peak level for a full year. The unemployment rate rose further (s.a.)
in June, to 8.8 percent from 8.6 percent in May. Belgian unemployment
rose as well, to 9.2 percent (n.s.a.) in June, and is now 2 percentage
points above its level of June 1980. The Dutch consumer price index for
the second quarter was 6-1/2 percent above its year earlier level, approx-
mately the same increase as that experienced in the first quarter. Bel-
gian inflation appears to have accelerated again in July. The consumer
price index in that month was 8 percent above its year-earlier level, the
largest such increase since 1977. The reduced level of domestic activity
has had an effect on the Dutch external sector. Through May of this year
the trade account was approximately in balance, in contrast to a deficit
of $500 million for the first five months of last year.
Sweden's trade balance has gone from a deficit of $1.3 billion in
the second half of 1980 to a surplus of $400 million in the first half of
this year. This positive swing in the trade balance is attributable in
part to a weakening in Swedish economic activity.
