The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
A variety of indicators show signs that economic activity has
slowed recently. Industrial production declined a bit in August,
primarily reflecting developments in the automotive and construction
industries, and appears to have been reduced further in September.
Housing starts in August slid to one of the lowest rates of the past
decade. Consumer spending for items other than autos and business
spending for fixed capital both appear to have changed little since early
last spring. Although the rate of increase in food prices has accelerated
recently, most broad measures of inflation remain close to the second-
quarter rate.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Activity in the industrial sector eased noticeably over the summer.
By July 1981, the index of industrial production was only slightly above
its most recent high in January 1980, and it declined 0.4 percent in
August. Output in September now appears, on balance, to have been
reduced further. Auto assemblies were unchanged over the month, but the
available weekly data suggest declines in steel, electricity, and coal
output. Given the recent low level of residential building, a further
decrease in the output of construction supplies appears likely. In
addition, the output of many household durable goods for which demand is
influenced by the housing market may have been reduced further.
On the positive side, equipment production, which is about one-
fifth of total industrial output, has been trending higher for more
than a year. Recently, strength in output of this sector for business
has been narrowly based in commercial equipment, which includes computers,

and in energy-related equipment; orders data do not suggest a sudden
reversal of this trend. Output of defense equipment, which has grown
at a moderate pace during the last four years, is likely to grow further
in view of expenditure authorizations and orders backlogs.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing declined 0.6 of a percentage
point in August to 79.2 percent--its lowest level since October 1980 and
8 percentage points below the 1979 high. Capacity utilization in manu-
facturing historically has averaged 83 percent; it has been at or below
the 80 percent mark for the 16 months ended with August--nearly as long
as during and after the 1974-75 and the 1970-71 recessions.
Employment and Unemployment
Employment was little changed in August after growing strongly in
July, and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits suggest
some weakening of labor demand in recent weeks. Filings for the four
weeks ended September 18 have averaged 50,000 above the preceding four
weeks.
The establishment survey reported an increase of 61,000 in employ-
ment in August, less than half of the average monthly rise during the
current expansion. In the goods-producing sectors, the industries
showing employment growth included oil and gas extraction and the
factories that manufacture their equipment. In manufacturing, aside
from losses in the volatile food products industry and gains in petro-
leum machinery, the August employment changes were generally small and
offsetting, and the factory workweek also held steady. Trade, services,
transportation, and public utilities also continued to grow in August
at their average rates of recent months. Construction employment,

although unchanged, had declined gradually since May and remains slightly
below last year's trough. Government employment, reflecting budget cuts,
the phase-out of the CETA program, and the firing of the air traffic
controllers, also continued to edge down.
The unemployment rate edged up to 7.2 percent in August--close to
the 7.3 percent average prevailing so far this year. Much of the August
rise in unemployment occurred among black teenagers whose unemployment
rate climbed to 46 percent in August after averaging about 36 percent
earlier this year. Weaker demand for labor also has helped to limit
the uptrend in the overall participation rate, which has risen only 0.2
percentage point in the last year compared to 0.6 percentage point per
year during the four prior years.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Personal income growth averaged 15 percent at an annual rate in
July and August after rising more slowly in the second quarter. In
July, the quicker pace was attributable to the annual cost-of-living
increase for social security and to strong growth in factory payrolls.
In August, large payroll increases in the service-producing sector
boosted the wage and salary component. While these gains have boosted
real disposable personal income, consumer wealth apparently has been
weakened in recent months by the drop in bond and equity prices;
additionally, the marketability of the housing stock has nearly evaporated.
Consumer spending has been relatively sluggish through the summer.
Auto sales benefited from purchase incentives in August and early
September, but the rise in retail sales excluding automobiles and building

materials in August only offset the July decline. Indeed, nonauto retail
sales in nominal terms are only slightly above their March level. Sales
at furniture and appliance stores, which typically respond to credit
conditions, have been particularly poor, although sales at general mer-
chandise and apparel stores have shown small gains in nominal terms since
March.
During August and the first three weeks of September, substantial
credit and price concessions were offered on purchases of domestic auto-
mobiles, and these incentives boosted sales to almost an 8 million unit
annual rate for most of that rebate period. However, in the second
ten days of September, while the concessions were still in effect,
sales of domestic-model autos dropped to about a 6 million unit rate.
While data for any single ten-day period must be evaluated with con-
siderable caution, the decline may portend a very poor sales performance
after the rebates. Sales of foreign autos which have averaged about a
2.3 million unit annual rate between April and July, fell to a 2.1 million
unit rate in August--a decline that may be attributable to reduced inven-
tories of Japanese models.
Responses to questions in the latest consumer surveys taken by the
University of Michigan Survey Research Center and The Conference Board
that relate most directly to current developments in the marketplace
remain quite unfavorable. Both of the surveys report that confidence
declined in September, and that attitudes of individuals about purchases
of autos, houses, or appliances generally fell back to earlier low levels.

Inventory Investment
As retail sales fell in July, inventories at retail outlets rose
sharply--at a $30 billion annual rate--in what probably was an unintended
accumulation. While the buildup in auto dealers' stocks was an important
factor in the July buildup, nonauto inventory stocks showed increasingly
rapid growth during the summer. In particular, the book value of inven-
tories at general merchandise stores rose at a brisk, $5.9 billion rate
in July, following $5.5 billion and $2.4 billion rates of increase in
the two preceding months.
Stockbuilding also was quite large at the manufacturing level in
July, with significant accumulation in sectors in which demand has been
relatively strong, such as mining equipment and drilling rigs, and
the overall inventory-sales ratio remained at the 1.60 level prevalent
over the past year. A buildup in primary metals may, however, be a
result of the weakness downstream in auto production and construction
activity.
Residential Construction
Housing market statistics for July and August indicate that the
current slump has deepened. Moreover, mortgage interest rates have
continued to rise in recent weeks, and September data may show further
deterioration in activity. In August, housing starts fell to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 0.94 million units, down from the already-
depressed rate of 1.05 million units in June and July. Single-family
starts in August were at an annual rate of 591,000 units, down 40 percent
from a year earlier and one of the lowest rates since the series was

begun in 1959. Multifamily starts, about unchanged in August, were off
more than 20 percent from a year earlier. The less severe decline in
multifamily starts probably reflects the resiliency of the market for
condominiums, which now represent a large share of multifamily housing
activity.
The volume of sales and the prices of houses sold also have under-
scored the widespread weakness of the single-family market. Existing-
house sales in August fell to an annual rate of 2.26 million units, down
more than 30 percent from the recent peak in September 1980. In July,
sales of new houses were at an annual rate of 0.42 million units, also
off more than 30 percent from last year's high. Actual sales volume for
both existing and new houses may be even weaker than reported, as buyers'
difficulties with financing are probably causing cancellations of some
sales contracts before closing.
The average price of new houses sold, not adjusted for quality
change, was $83,600 in July--up 9 percent from a year earlier. However,
a large proportion of recent new-house sales apparently has involved
builder "buy-downs" of mortgage interest rates, which often cause the
reported price to overstate a builder's proceeds from a sale. The average
price of existing houses sold in August was $80,700. Over the last year,
such prices have risen only about 6 percent, but individual sellers
also frequently do not net the full proceeds when concessionary financing
is involved. Recent price performance in the housing market appears
weaker than during the 1974-75 downturn. Compared with that period,
the rate of increase in house prices during the past year has been 2

II-16
to 3 percentage points lower, even before adjusting for the price impact
of concessionary finance measures. The difference is due in part to the
higher real mortgage interest rate that has reduced the attractiveness
of housing as an investment.
Business Fixed Investment
Data on real business fixed investment show weakness through
August, and forward looking indicators give little indication of an
upturn in the near term. Taken together, July and August shipments of
nondefense capital goods, a measure of about 80 percent of investment
in producers'durable equipment, were little changed from the June levels,
and drilling for oil and gas has receded recently. In contrast, sales
of heavy-weight trucks and investment in real nonresidential construction
have risen somewhat.
Capital spending commitments data indicate weakness in expenditures
over the near term. Total contracts and orders for plant and equipment
in constant dollars have been little changed over the past five months.
Data on real orders for nondefense capital goods did show a sharp increase
in August; this large rise, relative to a 2.4 percent advance in nominal
terms, reflected a shift in their composition in the total. An unusually
strong increase for office and store machinery (which have a lower
deflator than other components) more than offset a drop in the remaining
items. Excluding orders for office and store machinery, new orders in
real terms have been flat all year. The recent data on new and unfilled
orders for nondefense capital goods suggest shipments of these could

II-17
continue to be weak through early 1982. In the volatile structures
category, contracts and permits over periods of a number of months also
have continued to show no trend, but recently they have increased
substantially in the three months ending in August.
Net capital appropriations of the nation's 1,000 largest manufacturers--
a longer term indicator--rose 5.9 percent in the second quarter of 1981,
according to the Commerce Department's July-August survey of plant and
equipment spending plans. Excluding petroleum, net appropriations rose by
almost 34 percent. The survey coverage is rather small--accounting for
only about 6 percent of business fixed investment--but in terms of average
lags this may suggest some recovery in capital spending after mid-1982 for
the firms in the sample.
Federal Government
Although the federal unified budget deficit for July and August was
substantially lower than during the comparable period last year, figures
for the year to date show about the same deficit in the current fiscal
year as in FY1980. Continuing trends that began in the winter quarter,
the growth of federal outlays relative to 1980 levels has slowed appre-
ciably in recent months while the growth rate of receipts increased.
The decline in the growth rate of outlays largely reflects recent cuts
in the federal work force, the CETA program, and transportation grants.
In contrast, more success in personnel recruitment and retention has
resulted in larger defense compensation outlays.
The strong growth of receipts is due to the effect of bracket creep
on personal income tax receipts, the build-up of receipts from the wind-
fall profit oil excise tax that was enacted last year, and the rapid

growth of nominal income during the first quarter of 1981. Corporate
tax receipts, however, will in September begin to be affected by the
Economic Recovery Act of 1981, the capital cost recovery provisions of
which are retroactive to January 1, 1981. To adjust for the change on
an NIA basis, the Bureau of Economic Analysis has revised downward its
estimates of corporate tax accruals for the first half of the year at a
$3.9 billion annual rate. The liberalized leasing provisions of the
bill account for almost half of this tax cut; most of the remainder is
due to the accelerated depreciation provisions.
There has been growing skepticism in recent weeks regarding both
the Administration's Mid-Session Review estimate of a FY1982 deficit
totalling $42.5 billion and its goal of balancing the budget by 1984.
The Administration has responded with a new round of proposed budget cuts
totalling $13 billion and tax reforms adding $3 billion to revenues in
FY1982. The new proposals include a $2 billion reduction in the growth
of defense spending, a further 12 percent reduction in nondefense appro-
priations that results in an $8.4 billion spending cut, and reforms of
entitlement programs other than social security that could save $2.6
billion. Revenue-increasing proposals include limitations on the use
of tax-exempt industrial development bonds, the elimination of some
energy credits, and the speed-up of corporate tax collections. A major
portion of the cuts specified on September 24 had been assumed in the
Administration's earlier projections, but the composition of the cuts
has been altered somewhat.
State and Local Government
Real purchases by state and local governments fell sharply in the
second quarter, and recent data indicate that the reduction in federal
grant support, shrinking growth in tax receipts caused by poorer economic

II-23
conditions, and a recent emphasis on conservative government continue to
constrain outlays.
Since January 1981, state and local employment has decreased by
153,000, largely due to the phase-out of federally-funded public service
jobs. A Department of Labor survey of CETA public service employment
reported that at the end of August, enrollment stood at 49,000, down
more than 200,000 from March 1981, when the Administration first issued
orders to dismantle the program. The remaining PSE workers are scheduled
to be cut by October 1. A preliminary follow-up survey of the terminated
PSE workers showed that of the first 131,000 who were laid-off between
March and May 1981, two-thirds (85,000) had been placed in either un-
subsidized jobs or in another CETA training program. Of those not placed,
about one-half were collecting unemployment compensation.
State and local construction spending also has continued on a
downward trend this year. In July, the value of new construction put-
in-place decreased 4-1/2 percent; over the past six months these outlays
have fallen by about 25 percent. Moreover, the near-term outlook for
construction outlays remains weak; according to the Dodge series, public
construction contracts--of which 85 percent are by state and local
governments--in the first seven months of 1981 were down 5-1/2 percent
from the first seven months of 1980.
Prices and Wages
The consumer price index jumped sharply in July and August, but
much of the acceleration resulted from a surge in homeownership costs
rather than a fundamental change in basic price trends. Excluding
homeownership, consumer prices rose 0.9 percent in August and ata 9.2

II-24
percent annual rate so far this year. The rate of increase in food
prices has picked up, but energy costs have remained an important
moderating influence in the consumer sector.
The CPI measure of mortgage rates rose rapidly in July and August,
and with commitment rates now around 18 percent, further increases can
be expected in coming months. However, home price increases have
slackened as high mortgage interest rates have depressed effective
demand. In August, the CPI measure of house prices, which showed steep
declines earlier in the year, was only 5-1/2 percent above a year ago,
roughly consistent with the general slowing that has been evident in
more broad-based measures of house prices.
Outside the homeownership category, food prices, which had been
little changed during the first half of 1981, have risen quite rapidly
in the past two months. Retail meat prices rebounded in July and
August, and prices for fruits and vegetables also rose sharply. While
a cutback in meat production has put upward pressure on meat prices,
consumer resistance to the higher meat prices may limit increases at
retail. Crop conditions have improved significantly owing to favorable
weather developments. Prices of crude food materials appear to have
declined further in September, and the record or near-record crops of
wheat and feed grains should tend to lower food costs later.
Increases in energy prices continued to be very small in July and
August, as they have since April. Gasoline and fuel oil costs declined
for the fifth consecutive month in August, and there are still signs of
weakness in petroleum prices in world markets.

II-26
The CPI excluding food, energy, and homeownership rose 0.7 percent
in August, following a sharp jump in July when there was an exceptionally
large adjustment in transportation fares. Prices for services other than
mortgage financing and energy have risen at a stubborn 11 percent pace
during the first 8 months of this year. In contrast, prices for commodities
other than food, energy, home purchase and used cars have risen at a 7
percent annual rate so far this year--down from an 8 percent advance during
1980.
In the business sector, the rate of increase in producer prices
for capital equipment continued to slow somewhat in August. The price
relief appeared to be fairly widespread with the exception of sharp
increases for oil and gas related machinery. In addition, costs of inter-
mediate materials other than food and energy have eased significantly
this year and rose only 5-1/2 percent at an annual rate in August.
The rate of wage growth also has slowed in some sectors, although
overall, not as much as the deceleration in prices. As measured by
the index of hourly earnings, wage rate increases for production workers
in manufacturing have slowed noticeably, rising 9-1/4 percent at an
annual rate during the first eight months of 1981 compared with a nearly
11 percent increase during 1980. The employment cost index, a more
comprehensive measure of wage and salary rates earned by all workers
in the nonfarm sector, also showed smaller increases for blue-collar
and union workers in the first half of 1981. In part, this slowing may
reflect the effects of a light bargaining calendar resulting in few
first year settlements that tend to be quite large. In addition, growing

financial strains in some industries such as rubber, airlines, trucking,
and newspapers have led to numerous reports of wage concessions by
unionized workers. At the same time, hourly earnings for white collar
workers, especially professionals and managers, and for service workers
have risen somewhat more rapidly this year than in 1980.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Short-term interest rates have eased since the August FOMC meeting,
but longer-term interest rates are sharply higher. Growth of M1-B has
remained weak, and demands for reserves have grown less than the volume
of nonborrowed reserves provided by the open market desk. Borrowing at
the discount window consequently has ebbed, the surcharge rate for fre-
quent borrowers has been lowered one percentage point, and the federal
funds rate has fallen by about 3-1/2 percentage points. Three-month inter-
est rates generally have declined 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points, and the
bank prime rate has been lowered a point to 19-1/2 percent. In long-term
bond markets, interest rates have risen to record highs, evidently in
reflection of deepening concern about the impact of prospective federal
deficits; home mortgage rates also have reached new highs. Stock prices
are down markedly.
Growth in M1-B picked up in August but then slowed again in September;
it remains well below the lower end of its target range for 1981. Despite
a diversion of funds to retail RPs, M2 expansion was strong in August and
has remained substantial in September, as high-yielding deposits and mutual
fund shares have grown apace. Growth of M3, which includes retail RPs,
also has been robust.
Businesses have continued to focus their demands for credit on com-
mercial banks, finance companies, and the commercial paper market; offer-
ings in the capital market meanwhile have fallen off further in response
to deteriorating market conditions. The federal government has continued
to borrow heavily, as have state and local governmental units despite the
relatively high level of tax-exempt yields. Household borrowing in the
mortgage and consumer credit markets remains depressed.

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Growth in shift-adjusted M1-B increased to a 7 percent annual rate
in August, but it appears to have slowed to about a 1-1/2 percent pace in
September.1 On a quarterly average basis, adjusted M1-B was unchanged in
the third quarter following only moderate growth in the first half of the
year. The sluggish growth of M1-B thus far this year has been much less
than would have been expected on the basis of historical relationships
among narrow money, income, and interest rates-at least as captured by
the standard money demand equation in the Board's quarterly model. The
shortfall of actual from predicted growth of M1-B--which has been predomi-
nantly, but not entirely, in the checking account component--may reflect
adoption of new cash management techniques. Indeed, an alternative money
demand equation designed to capture the incentives for more active cash
management tracks the growth in M1-B fairly well, on balance, thus far in
1981.
M2 growth in August, at a 12-3/4 percent annual rate, advanced from
the relatively slow pace of the previous three months, and the staff cur-
rently estimates that this aggregate slowed to a 9-3/4 percent annual rate
of expansion in September. M2 growth for the first three quarters of this
year is currently estimated at about a 9 percent rate, implying a velocity
that is broadly in line with historical experience.
The recent faster growth in M2 reflects a stepup in growth of small
time deposits in combination with continued massive inflows to money market
mutual funds. The increase in small time deposits was led by small saver
1. Recent inflows to other checkable deposits have continued to have a
smaller effect on M1-B growth than earlier this year--only about one
percentage point, on average, since April.

pay 25 basis points more than banks on SSCs, captured nearly four-fifths of
the $10-1/2 billion August inflow. Growth in MMCs was $7-3/4 billion in
August, somewhat less than in July. This slowdown probably was due in part
to the 130 basis-point yield advantage of SSCs over MMCs during the month.

Retail repurchase agreements (RPs of less than $100,000) expanded
rapidly in August and early September, likely restraining the growth of M2.
Retail RPs were promoted in the early summer, especially by S&Ls, and more
recently have been marketed aggressively in connection with the scheduled
introduction of the "All Savers Certificates" (ASCs) on October 1. Retail
RPs totaled $11.1 billion at all depository institution on August 31. S&Ls
have sold the majority of these instruments, but appreciable amounts also
have been issued by small commercial banks.2 It seems probable that retail
1. The maximum yield on SSCs was capped at 11-3/4 and 12 percent at banks
and thrifts, respectively, in February 1980.
2. As of August 31, 1981, outstanding retail RPs amounted to about $6.2 bil-
lion at S&Ls, $1.3 billion at MSBs, and $3.6 billion at commercial banks.
Estimates based on a sample of S&Ls indicate that retail RPs increased $700
million in the first ten days of September. In addition, retail RPs are
estimated to have increased by $1.1 and $0.3 billion at commercial banks
and MSBs, respectively, during the first 16 days of September.

RPs have substituted primarily for savings and small time deposits, but
they are not included in M2. They are included in M3, however, and the
recent incorporation of the newly available data on retail RPs raised M3
still further above its 1981 growth range.
Growth in bank credit picked up in August to a 10-1/4 percent annual
rate, but apparently dropped back in early September. Commercial banks
ran off Treasury securities in August and early September, while acquiring
other securities. Business loans paced a sharp acceleration in bank loan
portfolios in August, and real estate lending was stronger as well. Secur-
ity loans contracted sharply in August; reporting dealers pared their secur-
ity holdings during the month, and the amount of customer margin indebted-
ness at broker/dealers for the purpose of carrying equities declined sharply.
Business Finance
The large increase in business loans at banks in August reflected in
part takedowns of commitments arranged to finance recent merger acquisitions.
However, abstracting from merger-related loans, business loan growth still
matched the brisk pace of the preceding two months. The persistent strength
of business loans, which was widespread by industry, reflected a general
desire to defer longer-term financing as rates for such financing soared
to unprecedented levels; firms also tapped other short-term credit sources
in volume. In September, loan growth at large banks slowed somewhat but
issuance of nonfinancial commercial paper continued very strong.
Public offerings of corporate bonds fell in August to their lowest
level since July 1976. Although utility offerings increased sharply in
September, total public offerings of bonds remained well below the pace
of the first half of the year. A large proportion of bond offerings has

continued to be by lower rated corporations; yield spreads have not widened
further, however, with the rise in rates. Gross stock offerings also have
been curtailed in recent months, and merger-related redemption of shares
have resulted in a contraction in outstanding stock.
Major indexes of share prices have plummeted since the August FOMC
meeting, especially the AMEX index which heavily reflects issues of U.S.-
and Canadian-owned oil and gas companies. At the end of August, more than
$7 billion in stocks were held in margin accounts that had less than 40
percent customer equity and were especially vulnerable to margin calls in
the event of further price declines. As a result, the drop in stock prices
in September triggered heavy margin calls, and as usual a portion of these
calls were met, according to industry sources, by selling securities.
Aggregate indicators of financial difficulties show that many firms
continue to be under considerable strain.1 For example, the recent pace of

business bankruptcy filings has moderated only slightly from the record highs
set this spring, and the number of business failures, reported by Dun &
Bradstreet, has remained high. The number of failures through August is
40 percent above the comparable period of 1980.
Government Finance
The federal government probably had a combined-budget surplus in Sep-
tember of roughly $3 billion, reflecting seasonally heavy tax payments.
Nevertheless, the Treasury borrowed more than $8-1/4 billion in the market,
since it needed to build up its cash balance in anticipation of a large
fourth-quarter deficit. Federally sponsored credit agencies borrowed about
$5-1/4 billion in both August and September, nearly four-fifths of which was
raised by the FHLBs to finance advances to thrift institutions. FNMA raised
about $1 billion in each month.
These financings completed a program of heavy borrowing during fiscal
1981. The unified deficit is estimated to have been about $59 billion for
the year, and the off-budget deficit is estimated at nearly $21 billion (or
$7 billion higher than in fiscal 1980). Moreover, the Treasury's market
borrowing requirements--swollen by continuing redemptions of savings bonds,
foreign series obligations, and other nonmarketable securities--totaled
nearly $88 billion. Sponsored credit agencies borrowed $38 billion in fis-
cal 1981, $16 billion more than the then-record amount in the preceding fis-
cal year.
The current and prospective volume of Treasury and sponsored agency
financing continues to concern market participants. Despite the downward
movement in short-term rates, evidence of sluggish economic activity, and
modest growth in narrow money, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates

As a result of recent rate movements, the Treasury yield curve has
flattened significantly (see chart on page III-12). The difference in
yield between the curve's current peak at two years and its lowest point
at 30 years is about 140 basis points compared with nearly 350 basis
points in mid-August.
Yields on tax-exempt securities also posted new record highs during
the intermeeting period. Quality spreads widened somewhat as well, but
they are not especially large by historical standards. Despite the over-
all increase in tax-exempt yields, the volume of both short- and longer-
term municipal financings has remained sizable in recent months, especially
revenue issues--such as those of municipal electric authorities--which typ-
ically are less sensitive to interest rate movements.
Institutional investors that traditionally purchase intermediate-
and long-term tax-exempt securities--mainly property/casualty insurers
and banks--have pared their acquisitions in recent months. This cutback,
together with the recently enacted tax legislation that reduced the

III-14
attractiveness of tax-exempt income, has contributed to a sharp increase in
the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable bond yields (see chart on page 111-20).

Mortgage Markets
Conditions in the residential mortgage markets have tightened fur-
ther since the last FOMC meeting. Primary home mortgage rates are at
record levels, averaging over 18 percent nationwide at S&Ls on commitments
for fixed-rate loans; the ceiling rate on FHA/VA level payment loans was
raised to 17-1/2 percent in mid-September, its second full-point increase
in less than four weeks. However, the average contract rate (excluding
fees and charges) on all types of conventional home mortgage loans closed
was about 14-7/8 percent in August. The sharp difference between the inter-
est rates on new commitments and on loan closings partly reflects takedowns
of commitments made earlier at lower rates--as well as the variety of types
of loans made--but it also suggests that some lenders have been quoting
very high rates on new fixed-rate commitments to discourage this type of
transaction.1
1. There are reports of lenders making loans at below market rates to buy-
ers, to facilitate sales by buyers to whom the lender has extended con-
struction loans.

III-15
Use of nontraditional financing techniques continues to grow. For
example, partial returns from a national survey suggest that less than
half of recent home mortgage loans at S&Ls carried fixed interest rates,
with one-third of the fixed-rate loans involving a builder "buydown."
Also, a recent study of resale transactions suggests that a majority of
existing-home sales now entail assumptions of first trusts and/or owner
takebacks of second mortgages. The second mortgages are typically inter-
est-only loans for three to five years that carry a "balloon" principal
repayment upon maturity.
Thrift institutions that in the past accounted for a large propor-
tion of mortgage lending activity have continued to experience weak depos-
it flows and earnings pressures. Although savings and small time deposits
at thrift institutions edged up in September, this followed three consecu-
tive months of contraction, and thrifts have continued to turn elsewhere
for funds to support their activities. However, many sources of such
financing have become more expensive--or unavailable to weaker institutions.
Large CDs of S&Ls currently yield as much as 100 basis points more than com-
parable CDs of large commercial banks, and S&Ls have curtailed their issuance.
Moreover, "other borrowings" by S&Ls, excluding retail RPs, contracted in
both July and August. Consequently, FHLB advances have continued to expand
rapidly. Also, the Federal Reserve System announced in late August that
thrifts and other depository institutions experiencing protracted liquidity
problems can receive special extended credit at the discount window. As of
late September, eight thrifts had received such credit amounting to nearly
$350 million, and a number of other institutions had applied for loans under
the program.

Preliminary data for the first half of 1981 suggest that the ratio
of net income to average assets fell sharply at S&Ls and MSBs, and the
staff estimates that these ratios will decline an additional 25 to 45
basis points in the second half if interest rates remain at their current
levels.
Burdened by continued weak deposit flows and profitability problems,
thrifts have further curtailed their mortgage lending activity.1 At S&Ls,
new commitments for mortgages fell sharply in August to $3.3 billion (nearly
50 percent below the pace just four months earlier), and outstanding com-
mitments were at their lowest level since the summer of 1980. The liquidity
ratio for FSLIC-insured S&Ls fell to 8.1 percent--its lowest level since
October 1974--although this decline partly reflects the increase in retail
RPs that has tied up government securities as collateral. In contrast, MSBs
have been acquiring liquid assets in recent months, and the MSB liquidity
ratio is currently at a record high level.
The recent escalation of mortgage interest rates has made the origi-
nation of mortgages for delivery more difficult, and secondary market activ-
ity has dwindled in recent weeks. Average volume in FNMA auctions of for-
ward purchase commitments has fallen off sharply, and volume in other key
secondary markets for mortgages has slackened also.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit growth continued in July at about the
pace recorded in the first half of 1981. In August, installment credit
outstanding at commercial banks edged higher, while such lending by finance

companies may have accelerated somewhat as auto sales were spurred by sales
incentives. The proportion of total retail sales financed with new credit
extensions remained moderate through July, suggesting that consumers still
had considerable untapped borrowing capacity at their disposal. In August,
a nationwide survey of households suggested that both the proportion of
families holding credit cards and the percentage that uses them were the
same as in 1978, despite last year's consumer credit restraint program that
impinged mainly on revolving credit services.
Most measures of payment difficulties on consumer installment credit
revealed further modest improvement in the second quarter. The delinquency
rate on closed-end loans at commercial banks continued downward; new auto
loan delinquencies at finance companies fell to the lowest rate since 1976;
and the number of personal bankruptcy cases plateaued although at a level
much higher than before the liberalized Bankruptcy Code took effect in late
1979. In contrast, the percentage of home mortgages that is seriously delin-
quent continued to rise, although less rapidly than in 1980; at S&Ls, mort-
gage delinquencies in August were the highest since late 1976.

SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES
Of the 60 large banks participating in the August 15th Senior Loan
Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, 25 expected a pickup in
business loan demand over the next three months, while only 8 anticipated
weaker demand. Business loans had been growing rapidly for some time prior
to the August survey, and the continuing weakness of the bond markets may
have been a factor pointing toward further strength. Some respondents
expected merger activity to continue to boost business loan demand in com-
ing months.
At the time of the August survey, the prime rate stood nearly 100
basis points above its mid-May level, and the spread of the prime rate
over the commercial paper rate was substantially wider than in May.
However, the survey suggests that the rise in the prime rate was offset
to some extent by other changes in bank lending practices. Almost one-
sixth of the survey panel indicated that over the May-August period they
had relaxed standards of creditworthiness to qualify for the prime rate.
Nearly two-fifths reported that they had eased standards for given spreads
above prime. In addition, almost half of the survey panel reported a re-
duction in compensating balance or fee requirements for C&I loans. Very
few banks indicated that they had tightened the aforementioned terms of
lending. Meanwhile, the number of respondents reporting an easier stance
on lending to new and nonlocal customers was about equal to the number in-
dicating a more restrictive approach. Several respondents commented that
the easing of lending terms reported in this and several previous surveys
was part of an effort to meet intense competition from foreign-related
institutions for both national and regional business. Competition with
the commercial paper market also was cited.
For the first time since the August 1980 survey--the first survey
following dismantlement of the special credit restraint program--respon-
dents reporting reduced willingness to make consumer installment loans
failed to outnumber greatly those indicating increased willingness.
Several respondents to the latest survey commented that a rise in usury
ceilings in their states had revived their interest in consumer loans.
Three supplemental questions (see table on page III-B-4), addressed
the reactions of banks to a deterioration, if any, in the financial con-
dition of borrowers in the environment of high interest rates and slack
economic activity that prevailed over the six months preceding the survey.
More than two-fifths of the survey panel reported a deterioration over
the previous six months in the financial condition of an above-normal
proportion of customers to whom they had business loans outstanding. Of
these banks, nearly one-half indicated that they had reacted both by re-
questing additional collateral and by restructuring payment schedules,
while the remainder had taken one or the other of these actions.

Research and Statistics.
III-A-1

III-A-2
Nearly one-third of respondents reported a decline over the
previous six months in the average creditworthiness of applicants for
new business loan extensions.1 Almost 80 percent of those so reporting
indicated that they had reacted by rejecting a higher proportion of
applicants. The remainder had tailored loan agreements appropriately
for borrowers in strained financial condition.
Less than one-fifth of the survey panel reported increases over
the previous six months in delinquency rates on residential mortgages or
on installment loans to individuals. Those so reporting had reacted by
intensifying their collection efforts, by repossessing collateral, and by
restructuring payment schedules. Equal or greater numbers of respondents
reported a drop in delinquency rates on mortgages and installment loans
from peak rates observed last December and January. Many of these respon-
dents indicated that,around the turn of the year, they had tightened
their standards for lending to consumers and had stepped up their collec-
tion efforts, thereby helping to improve repayment performance.
1. Several respondents remarked that the average financial condition of
new applicants had not deteriorated, but that a reduced proportion of
applicants had been deemed able to bear the high interest rates prevalent
over the previous six months.

Appendix III-B*
IMPACTS OF THE ALL SAVERS CERTIFICATE
Under the Economic Recovery Act, depository institutions will be
issuing savings certificates bearing tax-exempt interest during the
15-month period beginning October 1, 1981 and ending December 31, 1982.
To qualify for the tax exemption, these "All Savers Certificates" (ASCs)
must have a one-year maturity and an interest rate equal to 70 nercent
of the investment yield on one-year Treasury bills established at the
most recent auction.1 The rate on ASCs issued between October 1 and
October 4 will be 12.61 percent; a new ASC rate beginning October 5 will
be established by the one-year Treasury bill auction scheduled for
October 1. Institutions issuing the certificates must invest 75 percent
of either the ASC proceeds or the net increase in small-denomination
deposits in mortgages, mortgage-related securities, or agricultural
loans.2 The tax exemption on ASC interest income is limited to $1,000
for an individual taxpayer and $2,000 for taxpayers filing a joint
return. The impacts of the ASC on deposit flows, the monetary aggre-
gates, thrift earnings, costs to the Treasury, and the mortgage market
are discussed below.
Deposit Flows. Deposit flows into the ASC will be constrained
significantly by the maximum $1,000/$2,000 lifetime tax exclusion. This
limitation, coupled with the current high level of interest rates,
places an effective ceiling on the amount worthwhile to deposit in an
ASC of $7,930 for an individual taxpayer and $15,860 for taxpayers filing
a joint return. Given these limits, the staff estimates that the ASC
will attract about S125 billion over the 15-month period it is available.
About 60 percent of this inflow should occur in the fourth quarter of
1981.
About S100 billion of the funds placed in ASCs will be shifted from
other consumer-type deposits. In particular, transfers from six-month
* Prepared by Michael Moran, Economist, Capital Markets Section,
Division of Research and Statistics.
1. The tax act also requires that the certificates be issued in denom-
inations of $500. However, under the interpretation of the statute by
the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee, this requirement
does not impose a minimum denomination on ASCs. Institutions must offer
a $500 ASC, but they also may issue denominations above or below $500.
2. Specifically, the tax act requires that at least 75 percent of the
lesser of (1) the proceeds from ASCs issued during a calendar quarter or
(2) the net increase--including interest credited--in saving and small
time deposits during a calendar quarter be used to provide "qualified
residential financing" by the end of the subsequent calendar quarter.
The statute also provides a list of investments that are considered as
qualified residential financing.

III-B-2
money market certificates (MMCs) should dominate the inflow since the
maturity of the MMC is similar to the ASC and MMC holders are likely to
be in relatively high income tax brackets. The regulatory agencies have
facilitated this process by permitting holders of MMCs to convert to the
tax-exempt certificate without incurring early withdrawal penalities,
and most of this shifting conseauentlv is expected to occur early in
the fourth quarter. The transfer of funds from retail RPs will be
another important source of ASC inflow, with about 65 percent of the
estimated S15 billion of retail RPs outstanding at depository institu-
tions at the end of September expected to shift. Some funds probably
will be diverted from 2-1/2 year small savers certificates and other
small time deposits; indeed, some savers may withdraw early from these
accounts and reinvest the funds in an ASC. Large-scale transfers from
savings accounts are not anticipated, given the relative illiquidity of
ASCs resulting from the penalties that would apply to early with-
drawals.1
The staff estimates that about $25 billion will be attracted into
ASCs from sources outside depository institutions such as money market
mutual funds, Treasury and municipal securities, corporate stocks and
bonds, and new saving. In all cases, flows from these sources will be
limited by the maximum S1,000/$2,000 tax exclusion and the likelihood
that these investors also hold some form of time deposit that they will
shift first. The largest inflow from outside sources will be from MMMFs,
but the loss of liquidity involved with shifting to the ASC should con-
strain the transfers from money market funds. Shifts from the municipal
market are not likely to be large since lone-term municipal rates
generally are greater than the return on ASCs, and the short-term munic-
ipal market--where the rates are below those on the ASC--is dominated by
institutional investors that are ineligible to purchase the tax-exempt
deposit. The volume of new saving generated by the ASC is likely to
be quite small since the elasticity of new saving with respect to an
increase in the after-tax rate of return is generally believed to be
very low.
The Monetary Aggregates. Transaction accounts should not be
affected by the ASC; thus, M1-B is expected to change insignificantly.
The staff's current estimates of the volume and sources of ASC inflows
imply an increase in the M2 annual growth rate of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 per-
centage points in the fourth quarter of 1981 with an additional increase
of 1/4 to 1/2 percentage points in 1982. Shifts from retail RPs are the
major source of the fourth quarter expansion, accounting for about
2 percentage points of the increase. The growth rate of M3 will increase
about 1/2 percentage point in 1981-Q4 with an additional increase of
about 1/4 percentage point in 1982. The impacts of ASCs on the monetary
aggregates should be transitory. When the certificates may no longer
be issued, M2 and M3 should eventually return to their former paths as
funds are reallocated to their previous location.
1. In the event of early withdrawal, a saver would lose the tax exemp-
tion on the account in addition to forfeiting three months of interest.

III-B-3
Earnings Impact. An improvement in thrift earnings will result
primarily from the cost reduction associated with the shifting of funds
from higher-yielding accounts. For example, at current interest rate
levels, transfers from MMCs will reduce costs by 3-1/2 to 4 percentage
points and the diversion of inflows from uncapped SSCs could result in
interest savings of 5 to 6 percentage points. In addition, inflows into
ASCs from sources outside the institutions could be reinvested at a
spread of at least 4 to 5 percentage points. The combined impact of
these influences on earnings is presented in table 1. Total thrift
earnings (after tax) are expected to increase between S1.1 and $1.6
billion as a result of the ASC, with the bulk of the impact occurring
in 1982. This improvement will not be sufficient to offset other
factors depressing thrift earnings, and both S&Ls and MSBs continue to
face the prospect of large losses in 1982. The corresponding increase
in earnings at commercial banks is estimated to be about $3/4 billion.
Costs to the Treasury. The earnings benefit to depository institu-
tions is small in comparison to the revenue loss to the Treasury,
estimated by the staff to be $4 to $6 billion. A substantial portion of
this revenue loss will be recouped by the elimination of the $200/$400
interest and dividend exclusion in 1982. A small offset also is expected
from higher income taxes or lower tax loss carrybacks associated with
depositories' profit gains attributable to the ASC. On balance, the net
cost to the Treasury is estimated between $1 and $3 billion.
Effects on the Mortgage Market. Despite the requirement to invest
75 percent of deposit flows in the mortgage or agricultural loan markets,
it is not expected that the ASC will either significantly increase the
availability or reduce the cost of residential financing. First, the
investment requirement is tied to the lesser of ASC proceeds or the net
increase in all categories of savings and small time deposits. Since
small-denomination deposits have been very weak at thrifts in recent
months, institutions may be able to meet the requirement with only negli-
gible investments in new mortgages. Second, given the earnings problems
at thrifts resulting from a mismatch between asset and liability maturi-
ties, institutions probably will seek to invest in shorter-term instru-
ments. In this regard, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board is seeking to
approve the purchase of GNMA securities with a commitment to resell
after one year as a satisfactory ASC investment. Similarly, FNMA will
issue a new one-year mortgage-related security that would qualify as an
acceptable investment outlet for the ASC requirement. FNMA is likely
to use the proceeds from this new instrument to retire its existing debt
rather than expand its mortgage portfolio. Finally, the list of quali-
fying ASC investments is rather broad and will allow institutions to
channel funds to sources only indirectly related to new mortgage activ-
ity. For example, home improvement loans, second mortgages, and agricul-
tural loans may be used to fulfill the ASC investment requirement. With
the limited flow of new funds to longer-term mortgage instruments, down-
ward pressure on mortgage rates is not expected.

Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown by the chart on the next page, the weighted-average
value of the dollar has declined by about 6-1/2 percent from the peak
it reached around the time of the August Greenbook, first dropping
by nearly 10 percent over a 6-week period and subsequently appreciating
by about 3-1/2 percent. The depreciation through mid-September was
associated with a decline in dollar interest rates and with market
sentiment that the U.S. current account may swing more sharply into
deficit than had previously been forecast. The depreciation was
particularly sharp against the Continental European currencies, in
part reflecting a tightening of monetary conditions in Switzerland
along with official pronouncements that German interest rates will
not be lowered until the mark has appreciated further and that the
German current account deficit is now forecast to shrink more rapidly
than had previously been predicted. The rise of the dollar since mid-
September was partly attributed to actions by the Federal Reserve --
namely, a smaller-than-expected reduction of the discount-rate sur-
charge on September 22, statements by Chairman Volcker and Desk
operations to drain reserves -- that were interpreted as signals that
dollar interest rates would not be allowed to drop precipitously,
as in the Spring of 1980.
On a bilateral basis the dollar has declined by about 10 percent
against the Continental currencies since the August Greenbook date,
by nearly 3 percent against the Canadian dollar, and by roughly 1-1/2
percent against the yen and the pound. The Canadian dollar was bolstered

by an announcement on September 1 that the Federal Government and
the Province of Alberta had reached an agreement over oil production,
pricing, and revenue sharing. The British authorities have pushed
up short-term sterling interest rates by roughly two percentage points
since the August Greenbook date to resist downward pressures on the
pound that were partly associated with a softening of the outlook for
oil prices and continuing political pressures for an easing of British
policies.
During the period since the August Greenbook date the European
Monetary System has withstood strong pressures.
The Swedish krona was devalued by 10 percent against a basket
of currencies on September 14. During the 5 weeks prior to the
devaluation Sweden sold dollars on a moderate scale.

, and on September 1
the Treasury repaid from balances about $1/2 billion equivalent of
mark-denominated Carter notes.
The price of gold has fluctuated widely during the last seven
weeks, rising on balance from around $400 an ounce at the time of
last month's Greenbook to a current level around $430.

Foreign lending by U.S. banks. Claims on foreigners held by domes-
tic offices and foreign branches of U.S.-chartered banks rose briskly in
the first half of 1981, increasing more rapidly than in either the first
or second half of 1980. While net new lending to the G-10 countries
slowed as compared with 1980 rates, net lending to the non-OPEC developing
countries, the smaller developed countries, and offshore banking centers
accelerated sharply.
Total U.S. bank claims on foreigners rose approximately $30 billion
(8.7 percent) in the first half of 1981, more than the increases of about
$25 billion (8.1 percent) in the first half of 1980 and $22 billion
(6.6 percent) in the second half. Claims on G-10 countries and Switzer-
land, which are mostly on other banks, rose only $6 billion in the first
half of this year -- less than one-half of the year-earlier amount --
largely because of an absolute decline in claims on the United Kingdom.
However, the lower rate of lending to the G-10 countries in 1981 repre-
sents a return to a rate closer to those prior to 1980, following the sharp
upsurge last year. By contrast, new lending to offshore banking centers
in the first half of 1981, amounting to $11 billion, was abnormally large,
being well in excess of the amounts lent in any full year 1976-80. Most
of this acceleration was in claims on the Bahamas, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
The $3.5 billion increase in claims on the smaller developed countries was
also greater than even annual rates of lending to these countries in the
past. The higher level of lending this year reflects greater U.S. bank
participation in continued heavy international bank lending to Spain,
along with drawdowns of large credits raised by Australia in 1980 and a
resumption of positive net new lending by U.S. banks to South Africa.

The $7.6 billion rise in claims on the non-OPEC developing countries
exceeded the year-earlier figure by $3 billion. Larger increases this
year than in the first half of 1980 were shown in particular by claims on
Mexico, Brazil and Chile, all three of which raised much larger amounts
through syndicated Eurocurrency credits than a year earlier. U.S. bank
lending to Mexico, amounting to $2.2 billion, continued to exceed that to
other non-OPEC developing countries, and this year Mexico has replaced
Brazil as the largest non-OPEC LDC borrower from U.S. banks in terms of
outstanding claims.

U.S. International Transactions
U.S. Merchandise Trade. In August the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit was substantially larger than in July. Only partial information
is available now; a more complete trade summary will be included in the
Greenbook Supplement. Exports declined somewhat from July levels, and
the value of imports rose substantially. About one-third of the import
increase was in oil as the volume imported rose to 6.4 million barrels
per day from low July rates (see the table on the next page); the price
of imported oil declined by nearly 70 cents per barrel to average close
to $33 per barrel in August (9 percent below the April peak price). The
remaining two-thirds of the August import increase was concentrated in
manufactured goods, with increases in steel and foreign car imports
accounting for only a small part of that rise,

When July and August are taken together, the trade deficit was only
moderatelylarger than the second-quarter average. The value of exports
fell about 5 percent. Declines in such items as agricultural commodities
(particularly corn), civilian aircraft, and metals more than offset the
strong pick-up in coal exports (following the strike) and in other items
such as automotive shipments to Canada and construction machinery.
Imports in July-August combined declined an estimated 1 percent
from the second-quarter level. A sharp decline in oil imports outweighed
a 5 percent rise in nonoil imports. The volume of oil imported in July-
August averaged 10 percent less than in the second quarter. Despite
sharp month-to-month fluctuations, the trend in oil imports this year
has been downward as a result of a drawdown of U.S. oil stocks as well
as a continued decline in consumption.

e/ Preliminary
The average price of imported oil declined by about $2.40 per
barrel from June to August, reflecting the continued weakness in world
oil markets. The August meeting of OPEC failed to reach an agreement on
a unified OPEC oil price. Although the Saudis apparently were willing
to increase their price by $2 per barrel in conjunction with correspond-
ing decreases by other producers, they decided to freeze their price at
$32/barrel in the absence of an agreement. At the same time, the Saudis

IV -10
cut production by 1 mb/d in September as a gesture of cooperation as
well as to encourage price cuts by producers facing recent large declines
in sales. Nigeria cut its oil price by $4/barrel (10 percent) following
the OPEC meeting, and similar pressure exists for Libya and Algeria to
reduce their prices.
The increase in nonoil imports in July-August (for which only
partial information is now available) was concentrated in manufactured
goods. Only a small part of the rise was in steel and automotive imports
from Canada. The value of passenger car imports from Japan and Europe
was the same as the second-quarter rate.
U.S. International Capital Transactions. Banks' daily average
Eurodollar borrowing from their own foreign offices increased by $4
billion in August but fell in the first half of September. The August
increase in Eurodollar borrowing was concentrated among the 10 largest
U.S.-based banks.

Credit extended to U.S. nonbank residents by foreign branches of
U.S. banks increased to a daily average of $8.6 billion in August. Mobil
repaid in August the funds borrowed from foreign branches in July in
connection with its attempted takeover of Conoco, but other US. non-
banks increased their borrowing. The continued differential between
LIBOR and the prime interest rate (the prime exceeded LIBOR by an
average of about 160 basis points in August) has encouraged the expansion
of this borrowing.
Total Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbanks fell somewhat in June, in
contrast to the sharp growth throughout the first five months of the year.
However, partial data for July and August indicate that the growth has
resumed. Foreign branches of U.S. banks reported a substantial increase
in such deposits of about $9 billion in July. Holdings of Eurodollar CDs
by money market mutual funds increased by about $2.5 billion during the
two months, reaching a total of $16 billion.
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States decreased
slightly in July. A decline in official holdings of U.S. Treasury
securities ($1.7 billion) outweighed an increase in other assets.
OPEC holdings of official reserve assets in the United States
increased by $2.4 billion in July; their holdings at the FRBNY increased
an additional $0.8 billion in August. Almost half of the July increase
was accounted for by Iran and was associated with the consolidation of

IV -12
frozen Iranian assets at the FRBNY in preparation for their transfer in
August to Iran's agent bank in the Netherlands. The consolidation
resulted in a net increase in liabilities to official Iran because some
banks transferred larger sums than they had previously reported on their
books as liabilities and because certain liabilities to "private" Iranians
were also transferred.
U.S. official reserve assets declined in July because about $600
million equivalent in Swiss francs were payed out to retire U.S. Treasury
liabilities denominated in that currency. $500 million equivalent in
German mark-denominated notes were retired on September 1,
The U.S. current account surplus fell in the second quarter to a
$4.3 billion annual rate. Most of the change resulted from the larger
trade deficit recorded in the second quarter than in the first. In
addition, net direct investment income receipts were reduced somewhat,
largely as a result of slower growth abroad and the effect of the dollar
appreciation on foreign earnings recorded in dollars, while net income
on other service transactions increased.

Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity in major European
countries remains weak. Real GDP declined in the second quarter in Germany,
Italy, and the United Kingdom and, at the end of the summer, unemployment
rates in these countries were at their highest levels since World War II.
French industrial production declined in the second quarter to its lowest level
since 1977. Real rates of economic growth in Canada and Japan continued
to exceed those in major European countries. However, industrial production
and consumer spending data in Canada suggest a slowdown in activity at
the end of the second quarter, while Japanese growth in the second quarter
remained low (4.8 percent s.a.a.r.) in comparison with recent Japanese
experience.
Consumer price inflation declined in recent months in Japan but
remained steady in Germany. Continuing high rates of wholesale price
inflation in Italy suggest that the deceleration of consumer price inflation
in recent months may be short-lived. In France and Switzerland consumer
price inflation rose significantly during the summer.
External accounts are moving towards surplus in Japan, France, and,
to a lesser extent, in Germany as well. The Japanese current account
showed a small surplus in July, while the German trade account, after
improving in the same month, deteriorated in August. The Canadian
current-account deficit jumped sharply in the second quarter as a result
of the relatively high pace of Canadian economic activity and a decline
in the terms of trade.
Central banks in the United Kingdom, France, and Switzerland raised
interest rates in September in order to counter inflation and to halt the
weakness of their currencies. The Swedish government devalued the krona

IV -14
on September 14 by 10 percent in order to increase Swedish exports; on the
same day, a package of measures, including a 3-1/2 percent reduction in
the VAT and a temporary selective price freeze, was sent to Parliament.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, economic growth still continues
to be supported largely by strength in the external sector. Although real
GNP advanced at a 4.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) pace in the second quarter, slightly
above its rate of growth in the first quarter, private consumption -- which
makes up more than half of GNP in Japan -- advanced at a rate of only some
2 percent. Contributions from both the public sector and private plant
and equipment investment were negative. Real exports continued to surge,
however, moving ahead at an annual rate of over 7 percent, and real imports
decelerated to a rate of growth of about 3 percent. Industrial production
(s.a.) declined by more than 2 percent in August, following two months of
strong increases. The Japanese Economic Planning Agency is reported to
be in the process of revising downward its forecast for real growth in
FY1981 (ending in March 1982) to less than 5 percent. While recognizing
in recent economic assessments that recent growth in Japan has been sluggish,
both the EPA and the Bank of Japan still foresee moderate improvement in
activity later in the.year.
The economy appears to have absorbed the effects of weakness in the
yen in recent months without any significant increase in price pressures.
Wholesale prices have been advancing at about a 5 percent annual rate
in recent months; and, although the CPI increased by 2 percent in September,
the average level of consumer prices in the third quarter was virtually
unchanged from its level in the previous quarter. Wages have been increasing
at an average 7-1/2 percent rate, almost exactly in line with the terms
of the spring settlement.

IV -18
The current-account surplus in July contracted by about $700 million
(s.a.) to a small surplus, largely on the basis of an almost $1 billion
increase in imports. The cumulative current account surplus for the first
seven months amounted to over $1.1 billion. In recent months, the pace
of OPEC portfolio investment into Japan is reported to have weakened in
line with the reduced external surpluses in OPEC countries.
Real GNP in Germany declined by 0.7 percent in the second quarter
after a gain of 0.4 percent in the first quarter. The level of real GNP
in the first half of the year thus remains barely changed from the second
half of last year, a level which, in turn, was substantially below that
of the first half of last year. This stagnation at low levels is also
displayed by industrial production, which is only slightly improved on
the low levels of late last year. The level at which economic activity
appears stabilized is clearly insufficient to arrest the climbing rate
of unemployment, which, at 5.6 percent (s.a.) in July, set post-war
record.
The rate of consumer price inflation continues relatively high,
with strong increases in wholesale and producers' prices in recent months
pointing to further acceleration. Consumer prices in September rose
0.5 percent and were 6.5 percent above their year-ago level.
The adjustment of the current-account deficit, which began in the
second quarter, appears to be continuing. Seasonally adjusted, the
second-quarter deficit was little over half of the first-quarter deficit.
Although the monthly current-account data, which are not seasonally-adjusted,
show larger deficits during the summer, the Bundesbank argues that much
of the. deterioration of the last few months is seasonal. Except for the

IV -19
lower trade surplus in August, the bulk of the adjustment is occurring
in the trade account, where very large gains in net export volumes
have improved the trade balance despite further deterioration of German
terms of trade.
The German government has presented its budget for 1982 to the
parliament. Expenditures in nominal terms are scheduled to rise by 4.2
percent and the budget deficit is projected at DM 26.5 billion, compared
with DM 34 billion expected for 1981. On the revenue side, the 1982 budget
includes a DM 6.1 billion transfer of Bundesbank profits, compared with
DM 3.2 billion this year.
In the United Kingdom, there are few signs of a recovery, but the
prolonged decline in economic activity seems to be coming to an end. In
the second quarter of 1981, preliminary data indicate that real GDP fell
1/2 percent (s.a.),about the same as the decline in the first quarter and
less than the quarterly decreases recorded in 1980. There was a slight
drop in industrial production (s.a.) in July; for the 3-months ending in
July, industrial production was approximately equal to the level recorded
in the previous three months. The unemployment rate has continued to
increase in 1981, although not as sharply as it did in the second half
of last year. In September, the unemployment rate stood at 11.1 percent
(s,a.), 2.3 percentage points greater than the rate prevailing at the end
of 1980.
The monthly increase in consumer prices in August -- 0.7 percent --
was the largest recorded in that index since March and April, when various
fiscal measures sharply increased prices. Excluding seasonal foods, the
prices of which fell in August, the rate of increase in consumer prices

IV -20
was 1 percent. About half of the August increases in the consumer and
wholesale price indexes was attributable to increases in the sterling
price of petroleum products.
On September 14, the Bank of England raised market interest rates
about 1 percentage point by lending cash overnight to the discount houses
at a penalty rate of 13-3/4 percent -- about 1 percentage point above
the rates at which the Bank had been doing business with the market.
The Bank of England stated that the rise in interest rates was primarily
a response to the weakness of sterling. Other factors in the Bank's
decision probably included the acceleration of inflation in recent months
and the rather buoyant behavior of the monetary aggregates. Between
February and August of this year, sterling M3 increased 16-1/2 percent
(s.a.a.r.), well above the 6-10 percent growth target for the 14-month
period ending next April; and, although at least some of the overshooting
may be attributable to the temporary effects of the (now ended) civil
service labor dispute and the consequent distortions of government
revenue flows, there is considerable uncertainty about how much of the
overshooting will be reversed in the coming months.
French industrial production for the first half of 1981 was over
8 percent below the level of a year earlier. Despite a 1.5 percent increase
in June, IP in the second quarter was marginally below the first quarter
level. Recent surveys by both INSEE and the Bank of France reveal
expectations of a continued mild revival in July -August. Although
inventories are still high, and orders and general demand perceptions
are low, the recent movement of these indicators is favorable.
Consumer price inflation in the three months through August
accelerated to 16 percent (a.r.) from 13 percent in the previous three

IV -21
months. Wholesale price inflation showed a smaller acceleration. In
August the trade deficit fell dramatically to only FF 160 million, the
lowest monthly figure since 1979 and compares with deficits averaging
over FF 5 billion in the previous three months. Increased exports are
the main explanation for the improvement.
The money supply (M2) has grown by 16 percent in the first six
months of the year. Previous relaxation in credit controls has been
extended to year end. The 10 percent M2 target has been abandoned; the
Bank of France is now unofficially aiming for a growth rate equal to that
of nominal income (perhaps around 12 percent). The National Credit Commission
has recently increased both the amount and maturity of a deposit for it
to be exempt from interest ceilings and effectively has reduced the interest
cost of funds to banks at the expense of savers. The Government recently
floated a 6-year bond paying 16.75 percent; the original FF 8 billion
offered was oversubscribed and subsequently increased to FF 15 billion.
In the last part of September, the French government suspended access of
importers to the forward markets and raised significantly their money
market interest rates in an effort to reduce pressure on the franc.
Nationalization plans continue to become more concrete. Banks that
had deposits less than FF 1 billion as of January, foreign banks, and
cooperative banks will not be nationalized. The nationalization of the
remaining banks will bring the total share of deposits of nationalized
banks to 95 percent. The foreign operations of the nationalized banks
will also be nationalized but the industrial holdings will be sold.
The Canadian economy recently showed signs of weakness. Although
real GNP (s.a.a.r.). rose 5.2 percent in the second quarter after a gain

IV -22
of 4.0 percent in the first quarter, most of the strength in the second
quarter occurred early in the quarter. By the end of the second quarter,
industrial production and consumer spending had begun to slow substantially.
There is no evidence of a slowing in the rate of consumer price inflation.
The consumer price index for the most recent three-month period (June-August)
rose 12.4 percent (a.r.) compared with 12 percent during the previous
three-month period.
The Canadian current-account deficit (s.a.) jumped nearly C$ 1.1 billion
in the second quarter of this year to almost C$ 2.4 billion. The substantial
rise in the deficit primarily reflected a C$ 0.7 billion decline in the
merchandise-trade surplus associated with a deterioration in the terms
of trade. Although both exports and imports rose by more than 7 percent
in volume terms, export and import values rose by 4.6 percent and 9 percent,
respectively.
On September 1 the governments of Canada and the Province of Alberta
announced that a settlement had been reached in their dispute over petroleum
revenue sharing. The agreement opens the way for an increase in Canadian
oil production and the beginning of construction on two multi-billion
dollar projects for developing Alberta's oil sands. The arrangement
provides for separate prices for old and new oil, and a windfall profits
tax on old oil. The Canadian price of conventional oil will not exceed
75 percent of the world oil price. The federal tax on natural gas exports,
which had been vigorously opposed by Alberta, has been dropped.
Economic activity in Italy continues to be sluggish. After rising
by 0.6 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter, real GDP fell by 0.8 percent
in the second quarter. Unemployment data reflect the weakness in economic

IV -23
growth: in July, the unemployment rate jumped to 8.8 percent, compared
with 8.1 percent in April. The July figure is unprecendented in the
last 25 years and represents over 2 million people, three-quarters of
whom are between the ages of 14 and 29.
Consumer prices rose by only 0.7 percent (n.s.a.) in August; during
the three-month period ending August, prices rose by about 13 percent
(a.r.) over the preceeding three months. Part of this decline is seasonal.
Nominal wages in Italy continue to grow rapidly and in July were about
24 percent above their year-earlier level. The trade balance continues
to show substantial, though somewhat narrowed deficit. In the first
seven months of this year the deficit averaged $1-1/2 billion (s.a.) per
month, compared with a $2-1/4 billion monthly average in the last half
of 1980.
The government has extended the deadline for expiration of its
import deposit scheme by five months to the end of February to permit
a gradual phasing-out of the scheme, thereby avoiding a sudden injection
of liquidity. The main purpose of the scheme, which consisted of a 3-month,
30 percent import deposit with the central bank, was to control the monetary
base.
On September 14 the government of Sweden announced a 10 percent
devaluation of the krona against a basket of 15 currencies which represent
Sweden's main trading partners and to which the krona has been pegged
since 1977. The devaluation accompanied a package of economic measures
submitted to Parliament, which includes: a reduction in the VAT from
23-1/2 percent to 20 percent, effective November 1; a price freeze until
January 1 on numerous items at the level of September 11 prices; and
the deposit of part of company profits in a special account at the

IV -24
central bank, with incentives for such funds to be used for productive
investment. In addition, one-third of the $2 billion of already planned
budget cuts will begin in January, rather than in July of next year.
The devaluation was designed to improve the trade balance and stimulate
demand. Although the trade balance has shown a small surplus (about $200
million) in the first seven months of this year, compared with a $1.5 billion
deficit in the corresponding period of 1980, most of this improvement
was due to weak economic activity in Sweden. In volume terms, a look
at the same periods.reveals a 10 percent fall in imports, while exports
remain roughly unchanged. Although the krona was stable vis-a-vis its
currency basket this year, it had risen against the currencies of most
of its main trading partners while declining against the dollar. Finally.
the current account is widely expected show a large deficit ($4-5 billion)
this year.
The budget cuts, price freeze, and VAT decrease were proposed in
part to reduce the inflationary impact of the devaluation. In recent
months consumer price inflation has moderated to about 7 percent (a.r.);
however, in spite of such moderation, the July CPI was over 13 percent
above its year-earlier level.
In Switzerland the consumer price index in August recorded a
7.5 percent increase over its year-earlier level. Inflation has been rising
since earlier this year; in response to this trend and to the weakness
of the Swiss franc against the dollar on the exchange market, the Swiss
National Bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by one percentage
point, to 6 percent and 7.5 percent respectively, on September 2. In
addition, officials announced their intention to restrict the availability
of central bank credit to commerical banks. The Swiss external sector

IV -25
continues to strengthen. The trade deficit through August was $2.7 billion,
compared with $4.8 billion for the same period Last year.
