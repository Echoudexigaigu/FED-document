The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
A widespread deterioration of economic activity appears to be under-
way in the current quarter. Industrial production is estimated to have
declined in October for the third consecutive month, and manufacturing
employment fell sharply, with declines occurring in a broad range of
industries. Activity in sectors that had been weak, such as autos and
housing, declined further. Business fixed investment has continued to
slip lower, while inventory accumulation has increased. A burst of
consumer price inflation occurred in the third quarter, although price
increases have continued to ease for many consumer and producer
commodities.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production declined 0.3 percent in August and 0.8 percent
in September, according to estimates of a month ago, and available data
indicate that a larger cutback occurred in October. Auto assemblies in
October were cut by roughly 11 percent, and the output of related parts
and materials probably also declined considerably. Trade reports
indicate that the industry currently plans a further reduction in
assemblies in November to 5.4 million units at an annual rate.
Production of durable goods for the home fell in September and
evidently again in October. Business equipment output declined in
September for the first time since last winter and, given the reduced
new orders for equipment and a diminished orders backlog, further
weakness in this sector appears likely. Materials output, which had
increased only slightly during the first half of 1981, turned down in

August and fell by more than 1 percent in September. Further declines
apparently occurred among durable materials in October, as raw steel
output dropped by more than 6 percent.
The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing, which had been
edging lower since May, fell to 78-1/2 percent in September. Declines
were both broader and deeper than in earlier months. The available
evidence suggests that this slackening continued in October, with
widespread declines occurring in durable manufacturing. The utilization
rate for producers of raw steel dropped almost 3-1/2 percentage points
in September and an even greater amount in October.
Employment
The employment situation weakened markedly in October. Payroll
employment, as measured by the survey of establishments, declined 200,000
in October, with job losses heavily concentrated in the industrial sector
and only partially offset by gains in the service sectors. Manufacturing
employment, which had not fully recovered from the sharp contraction of
1980, dropped 275,000, as sizable losses were pervasive across both
durable and nondurable goods industries. Employment in the transporta-
tion equipment industry is estimated to have fallen 85,000; because BLS
does not attempt to seasonally adjust motor vehicle employment during
the traditional model changeover period, the reported October drop
reflects the cumulative job loss since June. The factory workweek--
although up slightly from its holiday-reduced September figure--remained
near its lowest level since the 1980 recession. In other sectors, weak-
ness in construction employment persisted in October, but jobs continued
to expand in the trade sector.

Total employment (household survey), which had fallen substantially
in September, posted a further small decline last month. Unemployment
increased by more than one-half million workers, and the unemployment
rate moved upward for the third consecutive month and at 8.0 percent
was the highest rate since 1975. The latest increase in joblessness
occurred largely among adult male workers. As in September, layoffs
accounted for a large share of the October increase in unemployment.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Total personal income growth slowed to a 9-1/2 percent annual rate
in September, as employment cutbacks trimmed the rate of growth in
private wages and salaries. The contraction of payroll employment and
the small rise in average hourly earnings in October suggest that a
further slowing of private wage and salary disbursements has occurred.
In real terms, wages and salaries have been virtually unchanged since
January.
Retail sales in constant dollars in September were a bit lower
than early this year. Nominal sales gains in August and September--1.3
percent and 0.4 percent, respectively--were only large enough to offset
rising prices. Sales at gasoline service stations rose sharply in
September, while sales at food stores remained essentially unchanged
after a sharp advance in August. In contrast, spending for general
merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliances (GAF) declined 1.2
percent in September; in the third quarter as a whole, nominal outlays
for these discretionary items were up only fractionally.

Sales of new domestic autos plunged from a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 6.9 million units in September to a rate of 5.1 million units
rate in October. The decrease in sales occurred even though some of
the fall rebate programs were extended through October and into November.
Sales of new imported cars in October continued at the reduced 2.0
million unit rate of September, in large part reflecting the import
quota on Japanese-made cars. Consistent with sluggish consumer demands
in recent months, the Michigan and Conference Board surveys for October
suggest that consumer confidence in favorable business conditions and
employment and income prospects has declined significantly since last
summer. While the Michigan survey found expectations of generally
lower inflation and interest rates, the outlook for future economic
conditions deteriorated.
In a special question added to the October Conference Board Survey,
30 percent of the respondents said that they had delayed a purchase
because of high interest rates. Those interviewed said that on average
they would have had to pay 17-1/4 percent interest on the postponed
purchase. Cars were the most frequently mentioned postponed outlay.
Residential Construction
Conditions in the housing market in September deteriorated further,
thus extending the general decline that began in 1978. Housing starts
fell nearly 2 percent in September to a 920,000 unit seasonally adjusted
annual rate, approaching the post-war low. Permits issued for new houses
also declined further in September. Sales of new houses, at an annual
rate of 312,000 units, were the lowest in the 18-year history of the
series. Sales of existing houses have not declined quite so precipitously,

Measures of house prices have continued to increase this year,

homes sold in September was $79,000, only 5.6 percent above September
1980. The average price of new homes sold in September was $82,800, up
3 percent from September 1980.
Largely in response to weak effective demand for housing, cost
increases for construction inputs also have diminished in recent months.
The producer price index for materials for all types of construction
edged lower during the third quarter, following an advance of about
8-1/2 percent over the previous year. Producer prices for softwood
lumber and plywood--key inputs in housing construction--have declined
steadily since mid-summer.
Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment in real terms edged lower in the third
quarter, following a small decline in the second quarter. Equipment
spending has been especially weak in the past two quarters and is only
moderately above its cyclical low of 1980-Q2. There was a substantial
increase in purchases of motor vehicles in the third quarter, but as
measured in the national income and product accounts this was more than
offset by reduced outlays for electrical and nonelectrical machinery
and selected transportation items. Business spending for structures
continued to rise in the third quarter, though at a slower rate than in
early 1981. Real outlays increased for all major types of structures
except in the public utility sector where expenditures fell slightly.

Capital spending commitments in real terms continue to indicate
weakness in expenditures. Total contracts and orders for plant and
equipment, an overall indicator of capital investment spending, fell
5.8 percent in September. In the equipment category, orders for non-
defense capital goods dropped 8.5 percent. The ratio of unfilled orders
for nondefense capital goods to their shipments continued to fall as it
has for the most part during 1980 and 1981. Contracts as well as permits
for nonresidential structures increased in September. However, these
are volatile series and the September advances follow large declines in
August.
In addition to this near-term weakness, the latest McGraw-Hill
survey indicates that no increase is likely in 1982's real capital
spending. According to the survey, businesses plan to increase current
dollar capital outlays by 9.6 percent in 1982, but they anticipate
that prices for capital goods will go up by the same amount. It should
be noted that in past periods of sluggish economic activity,the McGraw-
Hill survey has tended to overestimate actual expenditures.
Business Inventory Investment
Manufacturing and trade inventories were accumulated at an increased
rate in July and August. This, plus the large increase in manufacturing
inventories in September, suggests that the total inventory accumulation
in 1981-Q3 will be substantial. Inventory-to-sales ratios generally
have been rising.
Movements in manufacturers' inventory have been dominated for the
past three to four months by the accumulation of durable stocks. In

particular, the book value of inventories in the primary metals and
machinery industries have been rising since May. At the same time
shipments and orders in these industries have remained weak, an indica-
tion that part of this accumulation was probably unintended.
Stocks of retail stores excluding the automotive grouping showed
sizable increases in August, rising at an annual rate of $4.1 billion
and constant dollar basis. A substantial part of this buildup occurred
at general merchandise stores where sales have been relatively unchanged
in recent months. Stocks of automotive stores declined at a $2.8
billion annual rate in August, reflecting the initial success of rebates
and other promotional sales efforts. Auto dealers' stocks of new cars
were reduced further in September, but they rose in October with the
sharp drop in sales.
Federal Government
Final figures for the budget for FY1981 show receipts of $602.6
billion, outlays of $660.5 billion, and a deficit of $57.9 billion. The
deficit was $2.3 billion higher than estimated by the Administration in
the July Mid-Session Review. To a large extent the underestimate
reflects the effects of slower economic activity on receipts. (An
attached table shows the evolution of budget estimates for FY1981.)
In the final quarter of the fiscal year, total expenditures on an
NIA basis were $3.1 billion higher, at an annual rate, than projected at
the time of the Mid-Session Review. Purchases of nondefense goods were
higher primarily because of acquisitions for the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. Transfer payments were lower than forecast in the Mid-Session

Review, but this was almost exactly offset by higher subsidies. Receipts
were less than previously projected, reflecting the downward revision in
the level of unified budget receipts and some technical factors.
Congressional action on the budget for FY1982 continues to lag,
causing forecasts for this fiscal year's deficit to become increasingly
uncertain. The House has completed action on 11 of the 13 appropriation
bills. The Senate, however, has passed only five major bills, which
generally exceed the targets set by the Administration in September.
State and Local Government
Purchases by state and local governments in real terms have fallen
further in recent months, as outlays continue to be constrained by the
ongoing reduction in federal grants-in-aid, sluggish growth of tax
receipts, and high cost of financing construction projects. The decline
in construction spending has been particularly sharp, and the value of
new construction in real terms in the third quarter was 22 percent below
its extremely high first-quarter level. For the first nine months of
the year, real construction outlays were 5-1/2 percent below the average
for 1980. Outlays for education buildings and for water and sewer
projects were well below 1980 levels, while highway and street construc-
tion was higher due to a boost in road-building last winter.
Preliminary data indicate that state and local employment edged up
about 20,000 in October. Overall, state and local employment has weak-
ened over the last half year. In the past 6 month period, payrolls fell
around 400,000 after six quarters of little change. The phase-out of
federally financed public service jobs accounted for most of the

II-22
decrease over the last half-year; almost 300,000 CETA jobs have been
eliminated since February.
Prices
The slowdown in inflation so far this year has been most evident in
markets for commodities rather than services. In recent months, retail
food prices have risen more rapidly and increases continued to be sizable
for both homeownership and consumer services.
Producer prices of finished goods advanced 0.6 percent in October,
following a 0.2 percent rise in September. This swing is exaggerated by
the treatment of car and truck prices in the PPI. The September index
was lowered significantly as liquidation allowances for 1981 models were
included in car and truck prices, and the October index was boosted by
inclusion of 1982 models at higher prices. Nevertheless, over the past
two months price increases for many other finished consumer goods and
for a broad range of capital equipment items have been below those earlier
in the year.
At the intermediate level, the index for materials other than food
and energy rose just 0.1 percent in October. The weakness in commodity
prices may be starting to reflect the recent declines in import prices,
as well as slack demand.
At the consumer level in September, a sharp rise in home financing
costs (3.2 percent) was partly responsible for the high September CPI
rate. The total index, excluding house purchase and mortgage interest
costs, advanced 0.8 percent, which is close to the average monthly
advance in this measure during the past year. Mortgage costs in the
September index were boosted by the increases of FHA/VA ceiling rates

from 15-1/2 to 17-1/2 percent. A subsequent reduction to 16-1/2 percent
should have a moderating influence on the October index.
Food prices at the consumer level rose rapidly in September, as an
earlier increase in livestock prices was passed on to the retail level.
However, producer prices for finished foods were little changed in
September and October, and a renewed price decline has been evident at
the farm level since mid-summer. These developments suggest that
inflation rates for consumer foods should moderate in the near-term.
Although gasoline prices rose in September for the first time since
March, the energy grouping continued to register only a small increase.
If food, energy, and homeownership are excluded, the September and
third-quarter rates for the remaining half of the CPI exhibit marked
increase over the pace of the first half of this year. Services, which
do not slow in the first half, account for much of the recent accelera-
tion. The third-quarter increase for services includes exceptional
adjustments in mass transit fares and telephone rates as well as the
large once-a-year hike in school tuition and related costs. Medical
services also have risen faster in the third quarter than during the
first half of the year.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage rates, as measured by the hourly earnings index for production
workers, rose at an 8.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, and the
preliminary data for October show another relatively small increase. This
index has risen at an 8-3/4 percent annual rate over the first 3 quarters
of 1981, a deceleration of almost 1 percentage point from last year's
rapid advance. Increases in hourly compensation for all persons working

in the private nonfarm sector of the economy--a more comprehensive
measure of wage and supplement costs--have averaged about the same
rate so far this year as in 1980. The wage component of compensation
has slowed somewhat, but the increase in social security taxes has
added about 0.9 percentage points(annual rate) to the rise over the
first three quarters of this year.
Due to the relatively light bargaining calendar this year, new
settlements have played a smaller than usual rose in wage developments.
On the other hand, contractual changes in previously negotiated agree-
ments are of growing importance in numerous key industries. Recently,
wage concessions have been granted by union and management employees
at several major airlines and at financially-troubled firms in the motor
vehicle parts, rubber, and steel industries. Negotiated changes in
work rules that could bolster productivity are also becoming more frequent.
Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector declined at a 2.2
percent annual rate in 1981-Q3, primarily reflecting the drop in output.
Since the business cycle peak in 1980-Q1, output per hour has risen at
a 0.6 percent annual rate. This poor productivity performance has offset
little of the rise in hourly compensation. As a result, unit labor costs
in the nonfarm sector rose at almost a 12 percent rate in 1981-Q3 and at
a 9 percent annual rate in the first three quarters of 1981.

APPENDIX II-A*
PLANNED CHANGES IN THE CPI HOMEOWNERSHIP MEASURE
The measurement of owner-occupied housing costs for the consumer
price index will be changed from the present method, based on house
prices and mortgage interest rates, to a.rental equivalence index,
according to an announcement on October 27 by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS). This change.will be introduced in two stages: first,
in January 1983, in the index for all urban consumers (CPI-U); and
second, in January 1985, in the index for wage earners and clerical
workers (CPI-W).1 As occurs in major CPI revisions, the revised
procedure will not be extended back to earlier periods, and thus the
switch to these new measures will not affect the past index levels but
only those subsequent to the change. The old series will continue to
be constructed for a six-month overlap period in each case.
The rental equivalence measure to be included in the CPI-U in
1983 represents an initial refinement of the current CPI rent index.
This work, already underway, essentially involves reweighting of the
rent sample to better represent owner-occupied housing and some changes
in calculation procedures. Augmentation of the rent sample and other
improvements derived from BLS research will require more time. Depend-
ing on the continued availability of funds, BLS will introduce these
improvements in part by 1985 and more completely by the time of the
next CPI revision, probably in 1986.
According to BLS, the experimental "rent substitution" measure
(CPI-U-X1)--now reported in the monthly CPI release with four other
experimental measures--will be emphasized more in the future. In this
series, the current CPI rent index2 is substituted for the homeownership
measure. Almost as important, its weight, which is based on the esti-
mated rental value of owner-occupied housing,3 is well below that of
the homeownership component of the CPI-U. As seen in the chart that
follows, the rent substitution measure for "All items" rises substan-
tially less than the current published index in periods such as 1979-80
and recent months when mortgage rates and/or house prices rise rapidly
and boost the CPI-U homeownership measure. The opposite occurs when
the CPI measure of mortgage rates or house prices declines (1980-Q3,
1981-Q1).

A change in the homeownership measure was first proposed before
the last CPI revision, but was postponed to allow more time for research
and discussion. According to BLS, the timing of the announcement and
of the effective dates for introducing the changes now planned was
influenced by several considerations, particularly by the need for sub-
stantial advance notice to the public. The early change in the CPI-U
(January 1983) is a response to recent tax legislation that indexes
tax brackets and personal exemptions to this measure. The new tax
brackets must be announced in December 1984 and will be based on CPI-U
data over the previous two years. Most private contracts, as well as
government transfer payments, are linked to the CPI-W. In view of the
number and duration of such contracts, a longer advance notice was
considered advisable for this series. Factors in hastening the BLS
decision include the increasing public concern about the validity of
the present homeownership measure as well as the serious erosion of
the data base for this measure associated with recent developments in
the mortgage and housing markets.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1-B posted a small increase in October, about offsetting its Sep-
tember contraction. M2 also strengthened, reflecting both the upturn in
M1-B and bigger inflows to the nontransactions component following the
introduction of the tax-exempt all savers certificate on October 1. The
expansion of the monetary aggregates was, nonetheless, less rapid than
provided for by the System's injection of nonborrowed reserves and money
market conditions eased considerably over the intermeeting period.
Most short-term market rates of interest have fallen 2 to 2-3/4 per-
centage points, drifting lower in October and declining sharply further
in early November. The basic discount rate was lowered to 13 percent,
and banks cut their prime lending rate 2 percentage points to 17 percent.
Long-term yields generally have fallen by around 1/2 to 1-3/4 percentage
points, and home mortgage rates have eased a bit from record highs posted
in mid-October. Although market sentiment has been improved by signs of
near-term easing of money and credit demands, concerns remain about the
long-range implications of federal budget policy. Such concerns are
reflected in the upward sloping yield curve that has emerged recently.
The overall credit demands of nonfinancial businesses moderated in
October. Firms borrowed less heavily from banks and in the commercial
paper market, and their issuance of long-term securities remained limited.
As the bond market rallied in early November, public offerings picked up,
likely reflecting long-delayed debt restructuring. Available data suggest
that household borrowing in the mortgage market has continued to shrink,
and consumer installment credit, which had been buoyed for a time by
stronger car sales, likely weakened substantially in October. Meanwhile,

the government sector placed heavy demands on credit markets as the Trea-
sury began financing a record quarterly unified plus off-budget deficit,
and state and local governmental borrowing remained substantial.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1-B, adjusted for shifts to NOW accounts, grew at only a 3-1/2 per-
cent annual rate in October. The persistent weakness in the growth of
M1-B in the face of declining interest rates appears attributable both
to a slowing of nominal GNP growth and to continued intensive efforts to
economize on cash balances as interest rates still remain at historically
high levels. As summarized in an appendix to this section, the findings
of a recent Reserve Bank survey indicate a considerable spreading of
sophisticated cash management techniques this year--with more in store
for the future.
M2 advanced at a 9-1/4 percent annual rate in October, up from the
comparatively slow pace of the previous month and the third quarter as a
whole. The relatively small M1-B component accounted for a disproportion-
ately large part of the acceleration in the broader aggregate as growth in
the nontransactions component registered a rather modest pick-up despite
the advent of the all savers certificate (ASC).
Sales of ASCs were sizable, but the bulk of these funds appears to
have shifted from other small time deposits, particularly 6-month MMCs.
Survey results indicate that ASCs had attracted $27-3/4 billion during
the first part of October.1 Meanwhile, MMCs ran off by a record amount,
1. The data cover deposit flows over the first two weeks of October for
commercial banks, MSBs and credit unions, and over the first twenty days
of the month for S&Ls. By institution, the $27-3/4 billion in ASCs was
divided as follows: $13-1/2 billion at S&Ls; $10-1/4 billion at commer-
cial banks; $2-3/4 billion at MSBs; and $1-1/4 billion at credit unions.

presumably reflecting large transfers into ASCs and into SSCs, which also
showed strong gains.l  A comparatively small portion of the flows to ASCs
appears to have been diverted from savings accounts, which declined at a
slightly slower pace than in September.
The amount moving into ASCs from retail RPs, which contracted by
$2-3/4 billion through mid-October to a level of about $11-1/2 billion,
also appears to have been small. The volume of retail RPs purchased with
the intent to roll over into ASCs evidently was smaller than expected, and
the bulk of these instruments represents high-yielding, low-denomination
alternatives to regulated deposits. Finally, as expected, MMMFs seem to
have been a minor source of funds for ASCs; expansion in MMMFs last month
showed only a moderate slowing from the strong September pace.
The overnight RP component of M2 declined by $2-1/4 billion (not
seasonally adjusted) in October, following an even larger contraction in
September. The weakness in RPs may reflect in part reduced needs by bank
dealer departments, whose securities inventories declined in both September
and October. Moreover, banks may have experienced collateral constraints
as U.S. government demand and note balances rose substantially over the
two-month period.
Growth of M3 decelerated to a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in Octo-
ber, the slowest rate of expansion in this measure in a year and a half.
The slowdown reflected primarily a runoff in large time deposits at com-
1. Flows into SSCs have surged since the August 1 removal of the cap on
ceiling rates, even though survey results indicate that the proportion
of banks and MSBs paying the maximum allowable rates has fallen to about
60 percent. Of those institutions, 85 percent paid returns on SSCs that
were within 2 percentage points of the 16 percent nominal ceiling rates
in September. About 80 percent of S&Ls were paying ceiling rates on
SSCs in September.

mercial banks. Issuance of large time deposits by S&Ls moderated only
slightly.
At commercial banks, total managed liabilities contracted in Octo-
ber, as inflows to core deposits and U.S. government deposits strength-
ened somewhat and bank credit expansion slowed. Indeed, net advances to
foreign branches were boosted by $4-1/2 billion in October. Banks con-
tinued, however, to increase their purchases of federal funds from Federal
Home Loan banks.1
Bank credit grew in October at an 8 percent annual rate, down some-
what from the pace of the previous two months. Runoffs of Treasury securi-
ties abated and bank acquisitions of other securities accelerated, but
loan expansion slowed markedly. Business loan growth, though still robust,
dropped to its slowest pace since May. Expansion in security loans moder-
ated as dealers trimmed their inventories, and real estate lending slowed.
Business Finance
Overall borrowing by nonfinancial businesses appears to have moder-
ated in October from the relatively strong third-quarter pace. In short-
term markets, the decline in business loan growth at banks was accompanied
by a sharp reduction in net issuance of nonfinancial commercial paper. The
deceleration in bank lending to businesses reflected a net decline in such
loans at foreign-related institutions, after several months of rapid expan-
1. In the past two months, some improvement in deposit flows coupled
with reduced mortgage lending has enabled S&Ls also to rely less on
managed liabilities--FHLB advances in particular. The decline in ad-
vances was unanticipated, leading to a buildup in FHLB liquidity to his-
torically high levels and an accompanying increase in federal funds
sales by these institutions.

sion, as well as slower growth at large banks.1 Latest data available indi-
cate that unused business loan commitments at large banks increased signif-
icantly again in September. The continued brisk expansion of commitments
in part may have reflected attempts by firms to ensure access to credit in
the event that conditions in long-term markets remain unfavorable or banks
decide to become more selective in their lending in a weakening economy.
The volume of public corporate bond offerings continued low in Octo-
ber, particularly for industrial and financial corporate issues, owing to
the high level of long-term rates. Offerings by utilities have held up
quite well, but even in this sector several sizable issues were postponed
in October when market conditions deteriorated temporarily. Private place-
ment activity also is estimated to have remained sluggish in October, as
life insurance companies apparently have continued to respond to the poten-
tial for liquidity pressures by directing a larger portion of their new
investments into more liquid instruments.
Share prices have risen somewhat over the intermeeting period; never-
theless, the broad indexes are still well below their recent peak levels
of mid-August. Because of the weak market conditions, new equity offerings
in October totaled only $700 million, seasonally adjusted, just half of the
already reduced pace of the third quarter.
1. The weakness at large banks may partly reflect the wide spread of
the prime rate over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Many
large banks now include LIBOR as a pricing option in loan agreements
with large corporate customers, and some report that they often book or
rebook loans abroad when customers elect the LIBOR option. Accordingly,
with the prime-LIBOR spread remaining wide in October, lending to U.S.
residents by foreign branches of domestically chartered banks picked up
from the already rapid pace of recent months. In addition, the weakness
in business lending at large banks also reflects Dupont's partial repay-
ment of the loan it took down in August to finance its acquisition of
Conoco. Repayment was reportedly made with the proceeds from new issues
of commercial paper, which by November 6 totaled nearly $2 billion.

Government Finance
The combined unified and off-budget deficit of the federal govern-
ment in the current quarter likely will be a record $54 billion.1 To
finance this deficit, the Treasury's market borrowing requirements-
swollen by continuing redemptions of savings bonds and other nonmarket-
able securities--will amount to $41 billion. The remainder will be
covered by a reduction of the Treasury's cash balance and other means
of finance.
It is expected that all of the increase in Treasury borrowing in
the fourth quarter will be in the short-term area. The Treasury will
likely tap the bill market for a record $24-1/2 billion, while the vol-
ume of coupon financing probably will be about in line with other recent
quarters. Thus far in the quarter, the Treasury has raised $18 billion
of net new money, including nearly $4 billion in the recently completed
mid-quarter financing.
Borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies dropped off sharp-
ly in October to about half the pace of the third quarter. This decline
reflected a net repayment of debt by the FHLBs in response to their high
liquidity. FNMA raised $1.8 billion in new money in October, about $.3
billion of which was in Residential Financing Securities (one-year deben-
tures that satisfy the requirements for depository institution investment
of ASC proceeds). New yields on these instruments change daily. In Octo-
ber they averaged about the same as the investment yield on 1-year Trea-
1. About $12 billion of this figure is the result of an accelerated
Social Security payment at the end of the quarter. January's payment
will be issued on Thursday, December 31, since January 3 is a Sunday
and the previous Friday is a holiday.

sury bills, giving institutions a sizable positive net return on ASC pro-
ceeds--as well as saving FNMA some money. The rate spread between other
FNMA obligations and Treasury securities with similar maturities has nar-
rowed from more than 125 basis points in late summer to around 100 basis
points currently.
The gross issuance of municipal securities remained high in Octo-
ber. Volume in the long-term market totaled $3-1/4 billion (seasonally
adjusted)--only slightly less than the third-quarter average. A signi-
ficant portion of the proceeds of long-term debt continued to be used for
corporate-type purposes, such as pollution control. In the short-term
sector, gross issuance swelled to $5-1/2 billion with financings by HUD
and the state of Washington accounting for more than three-quarters of
this total. More generally, tax-exempt issuers appear to have stepped
up their use of short-term financing in recent months, partly in response
to the high level of bond yields. The outstanding volume of tax-exempt
commercial paper (not included in the short-term totals in the table)
has increased from about $500 million in June to $900 million in October.
Perhaps reflecting the heavy volume of short-term financing, short-
term tax-exempt yields have fallen over the intermeeting period by less
than half the decline in yields on Treasury issues of comparable maturity.
The introduction of ASCs may also have been a factor in the relative stick-
iness of short-term municipal yields, but the effect was clearly less severe
than some predictions had suggested.

Mortgage Markets
Mortgage debt formation weakened further in the third quarter, drop-
ping to the slowest pace since the second quarter of 1980. The decelera-
tion was most pronounced in the residential sector, especially at S&Ls
where net mortgage lending ground to a halt in September.
The near-term outlook for mortgage lending at thrift institutions
worsened in September against a backdrop of record-high mortgage rates and
weakened deposit flows. New commitments at S&Ls fell to $2.9 billion (sea-
sonally adjusted), the lowest monthly pace since the series originated in
1976, and loan commitments outstanding at these institutions declined fur-
ther.
High mortgage rates are, of course, deterring loan originations more
generally. The slow activity at mortgage bankers is reflected in part by
weak demand in auctions of FNMA purchase commitments. The volume of con-
ventional and FHA/VA mortgage commitments offered in the bi-weekly FNMA
auctions in October was only about an eighth of the already depressed aver-
age volume per auction in 1980. In addition, there has been no commitment
activity since mid-September in FNMA's auction for graduated-payment FHA
mortgages.1
In addition, mortgage activity currently is being limited by the
rapidly changing nature of mortgage instruments. Many mortgage lenders
continue to be reluctant to make long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans,
while consumers reportedly remain reluctant to accept the risks associ-
1. Commitments under FNMA's new mandatory delivery program also have
fallen sharply. The level of these commitments averaged only $50 to
$60 million in September and October, down from an average of $220
million in the previous three months.

ated with adjustable-rate mortgages, even with their typical 75 to 100
basis point markdown below fixed-rate loans. Nonetheless, recent FHLBB
survey data indicate that almost 30 percent of all conventional first
mortgage loans closed in early September were adjustable-rate instruments
of some kind.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit growth in September remained at about
the August pace, up somewhat from the previous few months. The increase
in credit growth--nearly all of which was at finance companies--resulted
solely from a surge in automobile sales that was spurred by sales incen-
tives programs. Judging from the plunge in new car sales in October and
sluggish consumer spending generally, the expansion in consumer credit was
likely quite weak last month. Weakness in consumer lending was evident at
large weekly reporting banks in October.
Owing in part to the sluggish combined growth in installment and
mortgage debt since early 1980, households in the aggregate have reduced
their debt burdens. In particular, the ratio of debt repayments to dis-
posable personal income declined in the third quarter to near its lowest
level in 10 years.

APPENDIX III-A*
FINANCIAL INNOVATION AND THE MONETARY AGGREGATES--
SUMMARY OF BANK CONTACT GROUP RESPONSES
Owing to the persistent weakness of M1-B this year, Reserve Bank
staff were asked to gather information regarding recent and prospective
developments in the use of cash management techniques. The findings
suggest that monetary growth in 1981 likely has not been substantially
reduced by a spreading of deposit sweeping arrangements, in which trans-
action balances are kept from rising above predetermined levels by
periodic transfers of funds to higher yielding assets; rather, the
recent weakness in money demand appears to have reflected a more inten-
sive use of cash management capabilities already in place as the year
began--in particular, the ability of large corporations to sweep their
own accounts, augmented by growing use of related cash management tech-
niques such as cash concentration accounts, lock boxes, and deposit
information systems. However, there were fairly widespread indications
in most Federal Reserve districts that demands by smaller and medium
sized firms for deposit-sweeping and other cash management services are
growing rapidly. In response, a large number of regional banks apparently
have begun to develop programs that will become available within the
next year or two, some as soon as early next year. On the consumer side,
growth in M1-B may also be affected in the near term by the growing
popularity and aggressive promotion of consumer-oriented cash management
services, and the continuing development by depository institutions of
retail accounts offering high liquidity coupled with market-related
rates of return.
Although the availability of cash management services and attrac-
tive substitutes for traditional transaction balances appear likely to
expand considerably in coming months and years, it was beyond the scope
of the survey to quantify the impact on M1-B. On the one hand, the
relatively few very large corporations that already have assimilated
fully available cash management techniques likely account for a consid-
erable part of business transaction activities. On the other hand,
many of the firms that have not yet adopted more sophisticated cash
management techniques may do so rapidly.
Under the deposit-sweeping arrangements currently available to
businesses--usually at large banks--balances typically are swept daily,
apparently about mid-morning. Sweeps may also be made upon the instruc-
tion of the customer, and there are a few reports that deposits may be
put into interest bearing alternatives up until noon or later. Swept
funds typically are placed in RPs or very short-term--overnight to 5-day--
commercial paper. Lesser amounts are said to be placed in CDs and Euro-
dollar deposits, with the latter apparently available generally from
large banks in the New York and Philadelphia areas, but obtainable else-
where mainly to accommodate specific requests of customers. Although
bank cash management services for smaller firms remain largely in the

developmental state in most areas, some banks already have begun to
publicize and offer such services.
Arrangements to pay for deposit-sweeping services vary by customer
and may involve fees, compensating balances (with required levels some-
times linked to market interest rates), spreads between what the swept
funds earn and what the customer receives, or some combination of such
procedures. It is thought that as deposit-sweeping services grow in
popularity and usage, more standardized pricing may develop.
Banks discourage overdrafts at the wholesale level, and overdraft
privileges do not appear to play a role in corporate cash management
techniques. There has been, however, increasing demand for cash con-
centration accounts, lock boxes, and especially deposit information and
projection services. The use of these techniques is reported to have
increased considerably in the past year in several districts.
Consumers also may make use of cash management services or they
may acquire various forms of highly liquid assets featuring market-
related rates of returns. Currently, cash management accounts are
offered by brokerage firms. They involve linking a demand deposit, a
MMMF, and an account at the brokerage firm; account minimums are on the
order of $20,000. Excess cash from the brokerage account is swept
weekly into the MMMF while checks written on the demand deposit account
are funded by running down first excess cash in the brokerage account and
then the MMMF. Credit is automatically extended to cover checks in
excess of funds in the MMMF by making margin loans against the securi-
ties in the brokerage account. Most districts report that cash manage-
ment accounts are being heavily promoted--including seminars to explain
their use--and that they have elicited considerable interest.
A similar service has been developed very recently in which a NOW
account and a MMMF are linked, with weekly deposit sweeping designed to
maintain a $2,500 average balance in the NOW account. Although this low
minimum balance type of service currently is offered only by a few insti-
tutions, major credit card companies are reportedly in the process of
providing client banks with similar capabilities. Such services report-
edly will become operational early in 1982.
At least one bank is offering retail RPs connected to NOW accounts,
with funds transferred between the NOW account and the RP at the customer's
1. For example, a New York City bank has recently begun to offer a ser-
vice to smaller firms which sweeps excess deposits into a MMMF daily.
For a fee of $100 per month, average balances are kept at $6,500; a
second plan, which maintains an average balance of $20,000, has no fee
attached. Another bank is reported prepared to sweep small firms' funds
into RPs in lots of $25,000.

III-A-3
instructions, in $100 lots. As well, there are several reports suggest-
ing that banks continue to seek competitive products that offer high
liquidity and market-related yields. For example, a West Coast bank
is reported to be offering $100,000 14-day CDs for $20,000 with the
difference lent at a rate equal to the yield on the CD. However, there
was-general agreement,aong respondents that banks' attempts to compete
with MMMFs by using loophole MMCs have not been very successful.1 Over-
draft privileges on retail accounts are quite common and are reported
to have grown significantly in recent years. It is not clear to what
extent individuals use this feature as a cash management technique.
1. Loophole MMCs--an arrangement whereby the issuing depository institu-
tions makes MC available for less than the $10,000 legal minimum
denomination by lending the depositor a portion of this amount, often
up to $7,000--appear-to be generally available in the New York district
but less common elsewhere. The loan rate is typically a fixed spread,
usually a percentage point, over the MMC rate, but sometimes floats
with the Treasury bill rate. In some cases, the MMC is linked with a
transaction account and is checkable up to the maximum line of credit.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown by the chart on the next page, the weighted average
value of the dollar has moved sharply down, up, and back down since the
September Greenbook, depreciating by about 3 percent on balance. The
net depreciation was associated with a decline of more than 3 percentage
points in short-term dollar interest rates, compared with an average
decline of about 1 percentage point in short-term foreign interest
rates. The temporary strengthening of the dollar during the middle of
October was associated with renewed sentiment that dollar interest
rates might move back up, with increased tensions in the Middle East
following the assassination of Egyptian President Sadat, and with
political confrontations in Poland.
On October 4 the EMS currency band was realigned, with the central
rates for the Deutschemark and Dutch guilder revalued by 5-1/2 percent
vis-a-vis the Belgian franc, Danish Krone and Irish pound, while the
central rates for the French franc and Italian lira were devalued by 3
percent. As a result of the realignment the market value of the French
franc depreciated by about 4 percent against the mark, which moved the
franc to the top of the new currency band while the mark and guilder
moved to the bottom. The market value of the Belgian franc depreciated
by about 2 percent against the mark.
The EMS realignment provided scope for a reduction of French
interest rates, which have declined by around 3 percentage points since
the last Greenbook. German interest rates have declined by about 1
percentage point over the same period. Continuing tight monetary

U.S. merchandise trade. In September the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit was reduced substantially from the extraordinarily large August
figure as exports rose and as imports declined. Exports of both
agricultural and nonagricultural goods rose in September from low August
levels. The drop in imports in September was largely in nonoil trade,
was spread among most commodity categories (including steel and foreign
cars), and largely reversed the sharp run-up in values in August. Oil
imports in September amounted to 6.0 million barrels per day (seasonally
adjusted), about 7 percent less than recorded in August; the average
import price was essentially unchanged from August levels.

For the third quarter as a whole, the trade deficit was little
changed from that of the second quarter with the value of both exports
and imports declining. About half of the decline in exports was in
agricultural shipments during the summer months. Falling prices accounted
for about half the decline in agricultural exports and a drop in volume
the other half. By September, agricultural exports particularly shipments
of wheat and soybeans, began to pick up with the beginning of the new
crop year, even though prices continued to ease.
The decline in the value of nonagricultural exports in the third
quarter was concentrated in metals (reflecting particularly a drop in
the volume of aluminum and a decline in the price of gold) and in
civilian aircraft. The drop in aircraft exports was from a particularly
large number of deliveries of big jets in the previous quarter. These
and smaller declines in other commodity categories more than offset the
sharp pick-up in the volume of coal exports in the third quarter that
followed the settlement of the miners' strike. On average, the volume
of nonagricultural exports dropped about 5 percent as demand from major
trading partners continued to be weak, while prices of these exports
rose by about 2 percent on average.
The third quarter decline in imports about equalled that of exports.
However, the decrease was more than accounted for by a sharp drop in oil
imports that far exceeded an increase in nonoil imports.
Oil imports in the third quarter declinedin both volume and in price.
The volume of oil imported averaged 9 percent less than in the second
quarter while the price dropped $2.35 per barrel. Despite some sharp
month-to-month fluctuations, the trend in oil imports this year has been

As a result of the October OPEC meeting, Saudi Arabia agreed to
raise the price of its crude oil by $2 per barrel to $34 per barrel and
to cut production to sustain this price through 1982. Several other oil
exporters (Nigeria, United Kingdom, Norway, Mexico) had been aligned to
the Saudi price prior to the meeting and are expected to raise their
price proportionally. Even though some producers agreed to cut their
prices to the new unified $34 per barrel marker price (adjusted for
quality differentials), the market share of these producers had already
fallen precipitously during 1981 so that the net effect of the unified
pricing agreement will be to increase the weighted average official
OPEC price. If the Saudis cut production sufficiently to prevent dis-
counts by other producers from the agreed unified price, the average U.S.
import price should reach about $35 per barrel early next year and remain
at that level through 1982.
The increase in nonoil imports in the third quarter was largely in
machinery and in consumer goods, with smaller increases in steel and
automotive imports from Canada being offset by decreases in both food
imports and in foreign car imports. The number of cars imported from

IV -7
Japan and Europe in the third quarter was 6 percent less than in the
second quarter, and was 20 percent less than the peak import rate in
the third quarter of last year. Since then (3Q80), the number of
foreign cars imported has declined each quarter. During this period
dealer inventories of foreign cars have been drawn down to near record
lows as sales declined only gradually.
U.S. International Capital Transactions. U.S.-based banks advanced,
on a daily average basis, $5 billion to their own foreign branches in
September-October. During the same interval, loans to U.S. nonbank
residents by those foreign branches increased, on a daily average basis,
by about $2 billion. The increase in branch loans most likely resulted
from more extensive use by borrowers of LIBOR-pricing options included
in loan commitments. The prime rate exceeded LIBOR by an average of 215

basis points in September and 195 basis points in October, somewhat more
than the 170 basis point average differential for the first eight months
of the year.
As shown in the table above, Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonb.nk
residents increased by about $25 billion in the first 8 months of the
year. About $9 billion of the increase was accounted for by holdings
of Eurodollar CDs by money-market mutual funds. The great bulk of these
Eurodollar CD holdings are with London branches of U.S. banks. Through-
out this period U.S. banks significantly increased their reliance on the
London CD market as a source of funds. As a percentage of outstanding CDs
at domestic offices of weekly-reporting banks, CDs issued by London
branches increased from 25 to 31 percent. During the 8 months the reserve-
adjusted costs to U.S. banks of Eurodollar and domestic CDs were about
equal.
The development of the Eurodollar CD market is likely to continue.
In mid-October three U.S. banks successfully petitioned the dealer
community to be treated as top-tier banks in the secondary market for
Eurodollar CDs, i.e., to be traded homogeneously at the lowest rate in
that market. This should improve the liquidity of the three banks'
issues, as well as the liquidity of the issues of the four banks already
included in the top tier. The addition of names to the top tier will
make that market deeper and perhaps allow an even narrower bid-asked
spread than the 10 basis points now quoted by dealers.
Beginning at the end of August new data have been collected on
overnight Eurodollar deposits of U.S. nonbank residents at foreign
branches of U.S. banks. These data show that U.S. nonbank residents

currently hold about $2 billion more in overnight Eurodollar deposits
than the slightly more than $6 billion in such deposits now included as
a component of M2.
Half of the $2 billion in newly-reported overnight deposits are at
the Caribbean branches of about two dozen regional banks. In October,
on a daily average basis, the amounts of such deposits reported by the
individual regional banks ranged from less than $5 million to more than
$120 million. Overall, the new data strongly suggest that the practice
of offering overnight Eurodollar investments to corporate customers has
now spread from the current M2 reporters (a total of 27 major money
center and larger regional banks) to a second tier of smaller regional
banks.
The remainder of the $2 billion of newly-reported overnight
Eurodollar deposits of U.S. nonbanks at foreign branches of U.S.
banks are outside the Caribbean, primarily in London. The London
deposits appear to be held mostly by money market mutual funds that are
willing to accept a somewhat lower yield in London to avoid Caribbean
exposures. To the extent that these London deposits are held by money
market mututal funds they are already reflected in M2.
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States fell about $4.8
billion in August. Partial data, based on holdings at the FRBNY, indicate
additional decreases totalling about $1.0 billion in September and
October. Holdings of the G-10 countries fell about $2.9 billion in
August and $2.3 billion in September-October,
.OPEC holdings fell about $1.6 billion in
August, but increased by a like amount in September-October

IV -10
Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity in most of the
major foreign industrial economies has continued to be weak. Only in
Japan, where in the third quarter expanding exports served to support
a 1.2 percent (sa.) rise in the level of industrial production above
its level of the previous quarter, has economic activity shown some
strength. In recent months, the unemployment rate in the major foreign
industrial countries remained virtually flat or rose from already high
levels and there has been little significant change in the rate of
increase of consumer prices.
The Japanese and the German current-account balances showed continued
improvement in the third quarter. Japan recorded a current-account surplus
of $2.4 billion in the third quarter, as compared with a $2 billion
surplus in the second quarter and a deficit of $1 billion in the first
quarter. The third quarter German current-account deficit is expected
to be lower than the $2.3 billion deficit (s.a.) posted in the second
quarter.
In most of the major industrial countries both monetary and
discretionary fiscal policy remain restrictive; the principal exception
is Japan where the Bank of Japan has projected an increase in the growth
rate of M2 in the fourth quarter. The generally weak economic activity
and high unemployment and interest rates have tended to increase
government deficits.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, a continued widening of the
current-account surplus has given rise to a renewal of international
criticism of Japanese trade policies. The current-account surplus for
September of almost $1.4 billion (s.a.) was the largest in two years and

brought the total surplus for the quarter to $2.4 billion, which is
somewhat above the second quarter surplus. Trade relations with the
United States and the EC in particular have begun to show signs of
strain as Japan's cumulative bilateral surpluses with them for the last
six months have reached $7.4 and $5.4 billion (n.s.a.), respectively.
The strength of the Japanese trade position has arisen both from
ongoing growth in real exports, which expanded at a 14 percent annual
rate in the third quarter, and a decline in real imports (at a 3-1/2
percent annual rate).
Although the latest monthly assessments of the domestic economy
by the Bank of Japan and the Economic Planning Agency are upbeat about
the prospects for near-term expansion of consumer spending, the pace
of the recovery of domestic demand still appears to be moderate at best,
as medium and small-scale firms still hold large unplanned inventories.
Although industrial production (s.a.) rose sharply in September from
its low August level, the. unemployment rate moved upward again after
3 months of decline. The ratio of job offers to acceptances, a reliable
indicator of labor-market conditions in Japan, fell in September, also
indicating weakness.
Wholesale prices in September were unchanged from their level in
August. Although there was a sharp upward movement in the CPI, in
September and October it was still less than 4 percent above its year-
previous level, reflecting the moderate trend of consumer prices in recent
quarters. The Bank of Japan has projected an increase in the growth
rate of M2 in the fourth quarter to a year-over-year rate of 10-11 percent,
about a point higher than the comparable figure for the previous quarter.

IV -15
Industrial production in Germany in the third quarter declined
somewhat further from its low level of the second quarter. This weakness
was fairly evenly spread across all industries with above average weakness
in steel and strength in automobiles. The rate of unemployment at
6.2 percent (s.a.) reached a post-war record in October. Job openings,
at the same time, were at their lowest level in the post-war years.
Apart from exports, for which recent data indicate a slowing of growth,
no domestic demand sector shows enough strength to indicate an early
end to the stagnation in output.
The rate of inflation continues to be relatively high. Wholesale
prices rose in excess of 8 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, while
the CPI rose by 5.2 percent. The CPI in October was 6.7 percent above
its year-earlier level. While the high rate of inflation in wholesale
prices point to no early let up in consumer price inflation, the recent
strengthening of D-mark exchange rates should have a moderating effect
on import prices and hence on the general price level.
The adjustment of the current-account deficit, which began in the
second quarter, appears to be continuing. Seasonally adjusted, the
second-quarter deficit was about half of the first-quarter deficit.
Preliminary data through September indicate that the adjusted third
quarter current-account deficit has been reduced further. The bulk of
the adjustment has occurred in the trade account, where large gains in
export volumes have improved the trade balance.
Only one month after the government presented its budget for 1982,
which projected a significant decline in the deficit below this year's
DM 35 billion, it has become apparent that a weaker economy than

IV -16
previously expected will generate less tax revenues and require more
unemployment benefits. So far, the additional fiscal shortfall is
estimated officially at about DM 7 billion. The government intends
to cover this shortfall by new taxes and a larger transfer of Bundesbank
profits than originally expected.
In France, real GDP grew by 4.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second
quarter of this year. The level of GDP in the first half of this year,
however, remained below its level for the same period in 1980. An
increase in real consumption expenditures of nearly 5 percent and a rise
of more than 34 percent in real exports, which were supported mainly
by a sharp increase in services exports, were the most important factors
leading to the strong real growth in the second quarter. In the third
quarter, consumer price inflation accelerated to more than 15-3/4 percent
from more than 13 percent in the second quarter.
The current-account deficit (s.a.) fell from nearly $2-1/2 billion
in the first quarter to under $1/2 billion in the second quarter. After
three consecutive quarters of improvement, the trade balance (s.a.) in
the third quarter deteriorated somewhat. The trade deficit in the first
three quarters this year was about $3-3/4 billion dollars smaller than that
recorded in the corresponding period in 1980.
French interest rates have fallen since the realignment within the
EMS, when the franc-mark central rate was changed by 8-1/2 percent.
At the end of September, 3-month money, for example, was earning 18-5/8
percent; in early November, the rate was 15-1/2 percent.
Industrial production in the United Kingdom, is starting to show
some signs of recovery. Although total industrial production was flat

IV -17
in July and declined slightly in August, the index for manufacturing industry
alone increased by 8 percent in the three-month period ending in August.
Output is still depressed, however, with total industrial production
at the same level that it was in the first quarter of this year and
manufacturing output only slightly above the first-quarter level. In
addition, a preliminary estimate for the third quarter indicates a
2 percent (s.a.a.r.) decline in personal consumption for the second
consecutive quarter. Third-quarter consumption is estimated to have
been at the level prevailing in the same quarter last year. Real personal
disposable income has fallen sharply this year; a decline in the personal
saving rate -- from 16.5 percent (s.a.) in the final quarter of 1980
to 12.5 percent in the second quarter -- has moderated the impact of the
drop in real disposable income on consumption.
Since April, when increases in various indirect taxes and public
charges substantially raised the price level. U.K. inflation has been
fairly moderate. In the five-month period ending in September, consumer
prices rose about 7 percent (a.r.). Wholesale prices during this period
increased 8-1/2 percent. Partly in order to prevent exchange-rate
depreciation from adding to the inflation rate, the Bank of England has
exerted upward pressure on market interest rates. In mid-September, the
London clearing banks raised their base rates 2 percentage points to 14
percent. At the beginning of October the base rates were again increased
by 2 percentage points, but subsequently have been reduced by 1 percentage
point to 15 percent.
Trade and current-account data for September have been published,
but data for the March-August period are not yet available. (The civil
service labor dispute has delayed publication of these data.) The

IV -18
September data indicate that the U.K.'s trade and current accounts are
still in surplus -- $24 million and $267 million, respectively -- but that
there has been a sharp reduction from surpluses averaging $1-1/4 billion
in the trade account and $2 billion in the current account in January and
February of this year.
Industrial production data confirm the weakness of the Italian
economy; in the third quarter, industrial production was 2 percent below its
year-earlier level. Leading indicators, however, suggest that the
weakening in economic activity may have begun to moderate somewhat in the
last four months of this year.
After moderate increases in the summer, the consumer price index
rose sharply in September and October to a level over 18-1/2 percent above
that of the year-earlier level. In the third quarter, the trade deficit
(s.a.) was $4-1/2 billion; in the first 9 months of 1981, the deficit
was almost $14 billion, compared with a deficit of about $17 billion in
the corresponding period of last year.
On September 30, the Spadolini government presented its 1982
budget proposals to Parliament. Expenditures relative to GDP are slated
to remain steady, with investment expenditures rising and social welfare
expenditures falling. Personal income taxes are scheduled to rise sharply.
The final form of the budget is unclear, however, because labor unions are
resisting the tax increase.
There is strong evidence that a slowdown in economic activity began
in Canada in the third quarter of this year. Industrial production (s.a.)
fell 1.3 percent in August after falling 2.2 percent in July. The
unemployment rate increased slightly in October over September to 8.3

IV -19
percent; this represents a more than 1 percentage point increase
over the August rate of 7.2 percent. There was little change in the
Canadian inflation rate in the third quarter.
The Canadian trade surplus fell from about $850 million in the
second quarter to less than $640 million in the third quarter. The
more than $2.9 billion surplus recorded in the first three quarters of
this year is almost $1.4 billion below the surplus for the comparable
period a year earlier.
The Swedish government has proposed a major reform of its personal
income tax system to be effected over the 1983-85 period. According
to the proposals, marginal income tax rates will be reduced significantly,
with the largest reductions accruing to those who earn between $20,000
and $30,000. Additionally, income levels to which the marginal tax
rates apply are scheduled to rise on average by 5-1/2 percent per year
over the period. The consequent loss of revenue will be partially
offset by a limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest. If the
bill is passed in its current form, it is likely that the government will
propose an increase in payroll taxes to finance the remaining net revenue
loss.
Real activity as yet shows no signs of recovery in the Benelux
countries. In August, Belgian industrial production was below its
year-earlier level, and the unemployment rate was again unchanged from
the July level of 14.4 percent (n.s.a.). Inflation remains high; the
consumer price index in the three months ending October averaged 8 percent
above its year-earlier level. In the Netherlands, industrial production
in the second quarter averaged 1 percent (s.a.) below its average for

IV -20
the first quarter, and unemployment rose further in August and September
to 9.5 percent (s.a.), more than 2 percentage points higher than its level
during the first month of the year. The consumer price index in October
was 7.1 percent above its year earlier level,
Disagreements about the future course of fiscal policy led recently
to the resignation of the Belgian and Dutch governments. No new elections
have been scheduled in the Netherlands, and negotiations for a new coalition
cabinet are underway. The Belgian election held on November 8 resulted
in gains for the right-wing Liberal party and substantial losses for the
Flemish Social Christian party of outgoing Prime Minister M. Eyskens.
No party won enough votes to form a government by itself, and a new coalition
will have to be formed.
