The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The deterioration in economic activity evident since late last
summer has intensified and spread to most sectors of the economy.
Industrial production declined more sharply in November than in previous
months, and cutbacks in employment occurred in a wide range of industries.
Activity in the ailing auto and housing sectors continued to weaken, and
ccnsumer confidence reached its lowest level since the 1980 recession.
Weakness in demand spread to the cyclically sensitive capital goods
sector; business equipment spending registered a precipitous decline
in October. Demand has fallen more rapidly than production, and as a
result there has been sizable and widespread accumulation of inventories.
Although recent reports have revealed substantial price increases for
some producer and consumer items, overall price increases are still
moderating.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production fell 2.1 percent in November, the largest
of four consecutive monthly declines. As in September and October,
reductions in output were widespread among products and materials. Out-
put of durable consumer goods dropped sharply; auto assemblies plummeted
to an annual rate of 4.8 million units, and output of consumer trucks
dropped 12 percent. Consumer nondurable goods output fell in November
and remained below its third-quarter average.
Output of business equipment declined again in November, as the
slump in economic activity spread to most of its components. Business
vehicle production was particularly hard hit. The pace of business
equipment output appears likely to continue declining in the near term;

capital goods inventories have accumulated for several months, and recent
commitments data suggest further weakening in capital goods spending.
Output of construction supplies also weakened again--continuing the
sizable declines in recent months.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing has fallen sharply since
August and in November was about 75 percent, close to its July 1980 low.
This operating rate is below levels reached in November 1970 and only 6
percentage points above the post-war record low reached in March 1975.
Capacity utilization in the motor vehicles and parts sector slipped to
nearly 50 percent, the lowest level since the General Motors strike in
1970.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor demand deteriorated further in November, and the unemployment
rate increased to 8.4 percent, 1.2 percentage points higher than three
months earlier. About three-fourths of the November rise in unemployment
resulted from layoffs. The unemployment rate for men aged 25 and over
climbed to 5.8 percent--just below the peak attained in 1975, reflecting
large cutbacks in manufacturing jobs. Nonwhite unemployment remained
at a record 15-1/2 percent.
As reported by the establishment survey, total nonfarm employment
fell nearly 240,000, about the same as in October. Cutbacks were
widespread; employment in the trade sector fell for the first time since
the June 1980 trough. Retail stores were cautious about pre-Christmas
hiring, and their employment declined 86,000 on a seasonally-adjusted
basis. Two-thirds of the November reduction occurred in the cyclically
sensitive durable goods sector, as production adjustments followed

weak October sales and sizable accumulations of inventories. Large
declines occurred in employment in the metals, machinery, and transpor-
tation equipment industries, and construction employment--already below
last year's trough--fell another 18,000. The factory workweek declined
0.2 hours in November and was a full hour below the peak reached in
May 1981.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Personal income growth slowed in October to an annual rate of only
7 percent. Reflecting the reduction in employee hours reported in
October, private wage and salary disbursements rose at only a 1.3 percent
annual rate; this compares with an increase of 10 percent recorded over
the preceding twelve months. Government payrolls were boosted by the
October 1 pay raise, and interest income continued to grow rapidly.
Despite the small increase in October incomes, disposable personal income
rose at a 14.4 percent annual rate because of the federal tax cut. With
disposable income rising and consumer outlays falling, the saving rate
jumped to 6-1/2 percent from September's 5-1/4 percent.
Consumer demand was weak in November. A rise in retail sales of
0.8 percent can be attributed to a slight increase in auto sales and a
rise in the price of gasoline. Excluding sales of automotive products,
gasoline, and nonconsumption items, spending at retail level was essen-
tially unchanged for the third consecutive month. Sales of largely
discretionary goods, such as general merchandise, apparel, and furniture
and appliances, edged up only slightly after sizable reductions in the
two preceding months. Sales of new domestic autos edged up slightly to

a rate of 5.4 million units a year, and foreign car sales were about the
same as their rate over the last six months. In the first ten days of
December, sales of new domestic autos eased back to a 5.2 million unit
rate.
Consumers evidently have become more cautious about discretionary
expenditures in recent months. According to both the University of
Michigan and the Conference Board surveys, consumer confidence declined
to its lowest level since mid-1980. Attitudes about the purchase of
cars, houses, and large household durables were again very negative.
Questions in the University of Michigan survey revealed widespread con-
cern about high interest rates, high prices, and rising unemployment.
The survey also reported that more respondents deferred major purchases
because of high interest rates.
Business Fixed Investment
Capital spending fell sharply in October, reflecting the sustained
weakness in demand and low capacity utilization rates. Shipments of non-
defense capital goods--about 80 percent of producers' durable equipment
in GNP--declined 3-1/2 percent. Machinery shipments were down 2-1/4
percent, and purchases of heavy weight trucks were reduced sharply.
Construction expenditures for structures declined a bit further, but
oil and gas well drilling rose substantially.
Data on fixed investment commitments in October suggested a further
weakening of capital goods outlays. Contracts and orders for plant and
equipment fell almost 4 percent in October, the eighth reduction this
year and the fourth consecutive monthly decline. A decline of 7-1/2
percent in new orders for nondefense capital goods swamped a rise in the

value of construction contracts. Permits for nonresidential construction
dropped almost 25 percent in October, offsetting a similar rise in the
previous month.
In contrast to other indicators, the Commerce Department's survey
of plant and equipment spending, taken in late October and November,
reported that businesses were planning to increase expenditures for
new plant and equipment at a 14 percent annual rate over the first
half of 1982. This survey, however, has a history of considerably over-
stating actual expenditures during cyclical downturns. Two private
surveys of plans for fixed capital expenditures suggest real outlays in
1982 will be no higher than in 1981.
Housing
High mortgage rates and low house sales continued to depress
housing production in October. Total private housing starts fell to a
seasonally adjusted 857,000 unit annual rate, the second lowest monthly
rate since 1946. This weakness was concentrated in the single-family
units, which plunged 25 percent to a new record low for this series. A
rise in multifamily starts partially offset the decline in single-family
units. A part of this increase represented the beginning of construction
on HUD-subsidized rental units authorized near the close of the 1981
fiscal year.
Sales of both new and existing houses remained at low levels in
October. Sales of new houses rose 15 percent, but they remained more
than a third below last year's pace, while sales of existing houses
dropped below the 2 million unit annual rate--the slowest pace since

early 1971. This depressed sales volume was accompanied by a continued
deceleration in measured house price increases. Average prices for
existing houses increased 4 percent at an annual rate over the first ten
months of this year, considerably less than the 14 percent rise during
1980. Likewise, the rise in new house prices declined to a 5 percent
annual rate from 12 percent last year.
While sales of new housing units have been low, production adjust-
ments generally have prevented a significant buildup of unsold units.
The end-of-period stock of unsold units declined in October for the
sixth consecutive month to its lowest level in a decade. Accompanying
this decline, however, was an increase in the ratio of completed unsold
new units to all unsold units. The median number of months that
completed units have remained unsold rose to 8.1 months, significantly
above the high of 7.2 months reached in the 1974-75 recession.
Inventory Investment
Despite sizable production cutbacks, business inventories have
continued to accumulate at a fairly rapid pace. In October, the book
value of manufacturing and trade inventories rose at a $58 billion
annual rate. Stock building by manufacturers moderated a little in
October, but substantial buildups were reported by several major
durable goods industries where in recent months shipments have been
weak and orders declining.
In the trade sector, auto dealers' inventory positions improved a
little in November. At the end of the month, dealers' new car stocks
were reduced to a level equal to 86 days of supply, down from the 95
days one month earlier. Outside of autos, a further rise in general

merchandise stocks pushed their book-value inventory-to-sales ratio in
October to 2.41, matching their previous cyclical high recorded in
November 1974. Merchant wholesalers' inventories also increased sharply
in October, with about four-fifths of the accumulation in durable
stocks. Stocks of automotive products, electrical goods, and machinery
rose substantially; distribution centers for steel and nonferrous metals
also reported sizable buildups.
Federal Government
The federal unified budget deficit in September and October totaled
$11.2 billion, essentially the same as in the comparable 1980 period.
Growth of receipts slowed a little, particularly in October, as a result
of the tax cut, a smaller increase in personal income, and an apparent
decline in corporate profits. Outlays in September and October also
increased at a slightly lower rate, reflecting budget cuts and special
factors, such as an unusually large sale of Farmers Home Administration
assets. In contrast, outlays by the Defense Department and interest
payments on the rising government debt continued to mount.
Program budgets for fiscal year 1982 remain unsettled. Only three
appropriation bills (pertaining to the legislative branch, energy
and water, and the District of Columbia) have been passed by Congress
and signed by the President. Six other bills, including appropriations
for Defense and Agriculture, have been passed by Congress and are
awaiting Presidential approval. So far this fiscal year, continuing
resolutions have been providing funding for government programs. The
latest resolution, which has been signed by the President, is for the
period December 16 to March 31, 1982; it provides for appropriated

II-18
nondefense programs that is about $4 billion below the administration's
March 1982 budget. When signed into law, new appropriation bills will
supersede the funding levels set by the continuing resolution.
State and Local Government
State and local government purchases of goods and services have
continued to decline in real terms, reflecting sluggish tax revenue
growth, reductions in federal support, and high costs of financing
construction projects. Outlays were held below revenues in the third
quarter, and the surplus net of social insurance contributions of $4.5
billion (in annual rate terms) was realized.
State and local government construction expenditures, postponable
items and often financed by federal grants, fell 4 percent in real
terms in October; these outlays so far this year have been well below
last year's levels. The recent declines in the Dodge index of public
construction contracts suggests that public construction expenditures
are not likely to increase in the near term.
State and local government payroll employment was unchanged in
November; so far this year 260,000 workers have been dropped from state
and local payrolls, largely because of the phase-out of federally-
funded CETA jobs. This contrasts with average annual employment growth
of 3 percent in the 1970s. Currently, nearly 40 percent of state
governments have hiring freezes in effect.
Prices
Recent price reports contain some further confirmation of easing
inflationary pressures, although the moderation is by no means evident

II-20
in all sectors. The consumer price index rose .4 percent in October,
and in November producer prices for finished goods increased .5 percent.
In the food sector, declining commodity prices were passed on to
the retail level in October, as the consumer price index for food rose
just 0.3 percent. Apart from a short-lived summer spurt, food price
increases have been small for most of this year. At the producer level,
declines in crude food and in finished food prices continued in November.
Except for food, producer prices for finished goods increased
sharply in November. Prices of both gasoline and natural gas surged,
reversing the downward trend in consumer energy prices evident since
late last spring. Capital equipment prices, which increased 0.9 percent
in October, rose another 0.8 percen in November; these increases were
substantially higher than those in the third quarter. Despite these
recent increases in particular sectors, the general behavior of prices
at the producer level has been relatively good. For the first eleven
months of 1981, the producer price index increased at a 7.4 percent
per year rate, well below the 11.8 percent rise in 1980.
Declines in homeownership costs and consumer energy prices held
down the October rise in the overall consumer price index. Excluding
food, energy, and homeownership, the index rose 0.7 percent, roughly
in line with increases earlier this year, and substantially lower than
the increases in 1980. Consumer food price increases have moderated
in recent months and are expected to continue rising very slowly over
the near term because prices for farm products fell in November for the
fourth consecutive month. Energy prices turned up in October, as pump
prices for gasoline failed to register their normal seasonal decline.

Wages and Labor Costs
The hourly earnings index for production workers in the nonfarm
business sector increased at an annual rate of 10-1/2 percent in
November, following several months of relatively small increases.
Despite this surge, the index has risen at an annual rate of 8.6 percent
over the first 11 months of the year, as compared with a 9.6 percent rise
during 1980. The rise in the manufacturing component of the index has
declined considerably this year, while the advance in other components has
moderated by only half a percentage point. Wage and salary increases
for white collar workers, as reported in the employment cost index,
were smaller in the third quarter than earlier in the year. However,
because of a large bulge in the first quarter, white collar salaries
have grown faster over the first three quarters of 1981 than they did
in 1980.
Although wage inflation has declined a little so far this year,
smaller pay increases have been offset by a large boost in social
security taxes. Increases in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business
sector eased to a 9.3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, making
the rate of increase so far this year about the same as over 1980.
Labor productivity declined in the third quarter following a half
year of increases above the recent trend rate of 0.7 percent per year.
Because little of the rise in compensation has been offset by product-
ivity gain,unit labor costs increased at an annual rate of 8-3/4 percent
over the first three quarters of 1981, following a 1980 rise of about
10 percent.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The monetary aggregates grew rapidly in November and early Decem-
ber, paced by strength in several of the most liquid types of assets.
M1-B accelerated markedly and, with a sharp increase in the nontrans-
action component of M2 as well, that broader aggregate expanded at its
strongest pace of the year. M3 growth also picked up in November, as
the surge in M2 more than offset an increased runoff of large time de-
posits.
Interest rates initially continued to fall after the November
FOMC meeting, as bank reserve positions eased further and market partici-
pants focused on weak economic indicators. The rally faltered, however,
owing to concern about the rise in the monetary aggregates and disappoint-
ment that the federal funds market had not eased still more. As anxiety
mounted, the prospective volume of corporate, municipal and, especially,
Treasury borrowing became more troubling; an administration estimate
that the 1982 federal deficit will exceed $100 billion was particularly
unsettling to market participants.
On balance, the federal funds rate is down a percentage point from
its level at the time of the last FOMC meeting, as is the discount rate,
but other short-term rates have risen 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point.
Most bond yields are unchanged to 1/2 percentage point higher; yields on
municipal bonds are up by 1-1/2 points. The yield curve has maintained
a considerable upward slope at the short end, reflecting a prevailing
expectation that interest rates will rise further in the months ahead--
about 2 percentage points by year-end 1982 in the case of 3-month Treasury
bills. Meanwhile, moving in lagged response to the earlier drop in bond

yields, the commitment rate for new conventional mortgages has declined
more than a percentage point since mid-November.
Aggregate business borrowing increased in November, as a surge in
issuance of corporate bonds more than offset a continued reduction in
shorter-term borrowing. States and localities, too, increased their issu-
ance of longer-term debt, and the federal government continued to borrow
heavily to finance its deficit. Reduced consumer spending has been accom-
panied by slower growth of consumer installment debt, however, and mortgage
formation remains depressed.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1-B, adjusted for shifts to NOW accounts, accelerated in November
to an 8-1/4 percent annual rate as a result of a large rise in other
checkable deposits and stronger currency growth. Despite the jump in
November, however, shift-adjusted M1-B has expanded at less than a 2 per-
cent annual rate thus far this year and therefore remains well below the
Committee's target range for 1981. Growth of M2 soared in November to a
16-1/2 percent rate, reflecting strength in both its M1-B and nontransac-
tion components. M2 has grown at a 9-1/2 percent annual rate since the
fourth quarter of 1980, above the upper end of its target range.1
Given the inherent volatility of the aggregates, the November surge
in money growth may represent simply statistical noise. However, it is
possible to pinpoint some reasons why monetary growth might have picked up
at this time. First, while the elasticities are uncertain, the decline in
short-term interest rates since mid-summer has appreciably reduced the

in 1981 appears in Appendix III-A.

opportunity cost of holding cash--perhaps enough to offset the effects of
weaker income and spending on transactions demands for money.1 Second, it
would not be surprising if the public built up holdings of short-term,
liquid assets in view of uncertainties about income and employment pros-
pects and the possibility that interest rates might rebound substantially
once again.2
Several categories of such liquid assets grew impressively in Novem-
ber, including other checkable deposits, savings deposits, money market
mutual funds, overnight RPs, and Eurodollars. The increase in savings
deposits broke a steady decline that began 14 months ago. Similar upticks
in savings deposits have occurred in some other periods--such as mid-1980--
when a "temporary parking" motive would seem likely to have been strong.
Inflows to money market mutual funds also have been encouraged by
the fact that fund yields have declined more slowly than current market
rates. Throughout November, the average yield on money fund shares was
about 250 basis points above the coupon-equivalent rate on 3-month Trea-
sury bills. Apart from the normal effects of accounting, the relative
yield on fund shares has benefited from the lengthening of the average
maturity of fund portfolios from the 25-day low reached in June of this
year to 37 days. With the yield curve now upward sloping, this allows
them to pay somewhat higher rates than they otherwise could.
1. With a lag, lower interest rates can also enhance monetary growth
through an increase in compensating balance requirements as banks adjust
their earnings credit rates on customer balances.
2. November's bulge in other checkable deposits is likely a result of such
behavior rather than a shift of balances into newly opened NOW accounts.
An informal survey conducted by the Reserve Banks suggested that the shift
of balances to newly opened NOWs is drawing to an end. The survey also
indicated an absence of a clear trend in pricing NOW accounts, although
several districts reported some reductions in minimum balance requirements.

On a monthly average basis, small-denomination time deposits contin-
ued to rise at a fairly brisk pace in November; however, there was a weak-
ening of inflows in the latter part of October that carried through Novem-
ber. Small Savers Certificates (SSCs), which had paced the growth in small
time deposits since the removal of the cap on their yields in August,
slowed in November, perhaps reflecting the payment of lower-than-maximum
rates by a growing number of institutions. Flows into All Savers Certif-
icates (ASCs) fell off sharply during November following the surge that
accompanied their introduction in October. In contrast, Money Market
Certificate (MMC) runoffs moderated as fewer deposits were transferred to
the other account categories; reportedly, almost all institutions are pay-
ing the ceiling on MMCs, which by virtue of a new averaging option now
more closely follows yields on MMMFs.1
1. As of November 1, the ceiling interest rate for MMCs is the higher of
the most recent auction average discount rate on six-month Treasury bills
plus 25 basis points, and the average of the most recent four auction aver-
age rates on six-month bills plus 25 basis points, for bill rates above 9
percent.

As noted above, the acceleration of M2 expansion more than offset a
faster runoff of large time deposits, leading to a pickup of M3 growth in
November. The decline in large time deposits was limited to commercial
banks, since thrifts continued to issue these deposits at the appreciable
pace of recent months. The drop at commercial banks likely was a result
of stronger inflows to core deposits together with a weaker demand for
bank credit. Other managed liabilities increased slightly as a reduction
in borrowing from foreign offices was more than offset by an increase in
other nondeposit funds.
Bank credit growth slowed markedly in November to a 3-1/2 percent
annual rate, the weakest pace since March. Holdings of U.S. government
securities fell sharply, while total loan growth slowed for the second
consecutive month. The principal area of weakness in the loan category
was business loans, which expanded at only a 2-1/2 percent annual rate,
down from 13 percent in October. Real estate loans decelerated a bit in
November but an advance in security loans accompanied a buildup of securi-
ties dealer positions.
Business Finance
Overall business borrowing appears to have picked up in November,
and its composition changed appreciably, as longer-term financings surged
while shorter-term borrowing dropped further. Public offerings of corporate
notes and bonds soared to a record $8.2 billion, seasonally adjusted--four
times its pace in October and more than twice as large as in any previous
month this year. The step-up in volume was distributed about equally be-
tween offerings by industrial and financial corporations; utility issues
continued at about the average pace of earlier months. Most of November's

new issues were intermediate-term, straight debt offerings. Original
issue discount bonds were very popular, with the proceeds of 12 such
issues accounting for nearly one-fourth of total offerings. In early
December, the pace of corporate bond offerings slowed in response to the
increase in interest rates, but the volume for December as a whole may
still approach $5 billion, seasonally adjusted.
Business loan growth at large banks and U.S. offices of foreign-
related institutions slowed sharply in November. Other forms of short-
term business borrowing, however, were more robust, reflecting the widen-
ing spread between the prime and market interest rates. For example, issu-
ance of commercial paper picked up in November and loans to U.S. residents
by foreign branches of U.S. banks rose substantially. Meanwhile, business
loan growth moderated only slightly at small banks, possibly because of the
lack of alternative sources of funds for many customers of those institu-
tions.
Stock offerings totaled $1.4 billion in November, seasonally adjusted,
up from October but still below the record pace of the first three quarters
of the year. Share prices generally have increased slightly on average
since the mid-November FOMC meeting; this continues the irregular advance
that began in late September. Even so, the major composite indexes remain
well below their summer peaks.
Although the recent declines in interest rates may provide some
relief for business borrowers, available data indicate that firms remain
under considerable stress in the current economic environment. Business
failures rose to a near-term peak in October and remained quite high in
November. Business bankruptcy filings also have been fluctuating at high

levels, with such filings in October only 6 percent below the historic
record set in February. Furthermore, nearly three-fifths of the bankers
contacted in the November Survey of Senior Loan Officer Opinion reported
a deterioration in the financial condition of an above-normal proportion
of customers to whom they had loans outstanding, and two-fifths reported
a deterioration in the financial condition of new loan applicants.1 Never-
theless, yield spreads between higher- and lower-rated issues of corporate
bonds and commercial paper have not increased recently, although they
remain relatively wide.
Government Finance
The Treasury borrowed heavily in November and early December to help
finance a record fourth-quarter deficit of $53 billion (combined on- and
off-budget), with about $12 billion of this due to an accelerated social
security payment at the end of the quarter. To finance the deficit and a
continued runoff in nonmarketable debt, the Treasury will borrow a record
$38 billion in the market in the current quarter.2 It will finance the
remainder of the deficit by a reduction in its cash balance and through
"other means of finance."3  Marketable borrowing in the fourth quarter
1. For additional detail on these and other results of the survey, see
Appendix III-B.
2. About half of the paydown in nonmarketable debt has been due to a con-
tinued redemption of savings bonds. To help stem net redemptions of sav-
ings bonds, the Treasury announced recently that it will seek permission
from Congress to index interest payments on new and outstanding savings
bonds (EE and the outstanding E bonds) to the market yield on 5-year Trea-
sury securities. The Treasury proposes to set the rate on savings bonds
equal to 85 percent of the average yield on 5-year Treasury issues prevail-
ing over the previous six months, with the return being adjusted every six
months.
3. The sharp rise in other means of finance in the current quarter reflects
the accelerated social security payment at the end of December. Because
many of these checks will not be cashed until January, they do not drain
Treasury cash until that time, although they are included in December out-
lays.

III-12
should consist of $22 billion of bills and $16 billion in coupons. In
the upcoming quarter, the Treasury is expected to borrow another $36 bil-
lion in the market to finance an estimated deficit of $27 billion and to
offset a further runoff of nonmarketable debt as well as drains on other
means of finance. It is expected that this borrowing will be about evenly
split between bills and coupons.
Credit demands of federally sponsored credit agencies have contin-
ued to diminish with the agencies paying off, on net, about $300 million
of debt in November. The redemption mainly reflected a paydown by the
Federal Farm Credit Banks; their borrowing is expected to increase again
in December. The Federal Home Loan Banks also paid down debt in November,
as they made almost no net advances to thrifts. Borrowing by FNMA is esti-
mated at $660 million in November, financing a similar amount of net mort-
gage purchases. Of this amount, about one-quarter came from sales of spe-
cial one-year debentures tailored for investment of All Savers funds. In
addition to this borrowing, FNMA issued $250 million of pass-through secu-
rities on December 2--the first phase of its new program for conventional
mortgages. These securities are backed by a pool of low-rate seasoned
conventional mortgages purchased by FNMA from S&Ls, banks, and other insti-
tutions. The agency guarantees the timely payment of both principal and
interest on the securities. FNMA plans to expand its program to include
guarantees of securities issued by others against pools of newly origi-
nated conventional mortgages.
Gross issuance of long-term municipal securities picked up in Novem-
ber, owing to a rebound in offerings of mortgage revenue bonds. The re-
bound was caused by several factors, including the decline in rates through

III-13
mid-month and federal restrictions on annual volume totals for each state
that have encouraged issuance of these bonds before year-end.

Municipal bond yields have risen appreciably over the intermeeting
period, both absolutely and relative to those on taxable obligations, as
the long-term tax-exempt market continues to suffer from a lack of demand
by major institutional investors. The ratio of tax-exempt to taxable
yields rose to an average 87 percent in November, and by the end of the
month it had reached a 9-year high of 90 percent.
Mortgage Markets
Residential mortgage formation has weakened in recent months. Growth
in real estate loans at commercial banks slowed to a 6 percent annual rate
during October and November, about 2 percentage points below the third
quarter's reduced rate of expansion. October data for S&Ls (the latest
available) indicate that these institutions reduced their holdings of mort-
ages by $500 million (seasonally adjusted), one of the few declines recorded

III-14
in this series in the postwar period. Moreover, the S&Ls continued to
extend only a small volume of new commitments, and their outstanding com-
mitments fell to the lowest level since June 1980.
S&Ls have experienced some improvement in the cost and availability
of loanable funds of late, however. Consumer-type deposits have shown
renewed growth, and the bigger institutions have continued to issue large
CDs. These developments have permitted a paydown of FHLB advances and some
rebuilding of liquidity.1 With the improvement in liquidity and reduced
earnings pressures, the strongest S&Ls reportedly have been able to issue
CDs at a spread of 50 to 75 basis points over the commercial bank CD rate.
This is a wider spread than the 25 to 50 basis-point norm of earlier years,
but it is well below the 100 to 125 basis-point peak experienced a few
months ago.
Recent declines in interest rates also may enhance loan demand a
bit. In the primary market for long-term mortgage credit, the commitment
rate on fixed-rate, level-payment home loans at sampled S&Ls averaged
16.94 percent in the week ended December 11, down from the peak of 18.63
percent in early October. To bring FHA/VA ceiling rates on fixed-rate
level-payment home loans closer in line with market yields, they were
lowered by administrative action to 15-1/2 percent from 16-1/2 percent,
effective November 16.
Rates on adjustable rate mortgages currently are quoted at approxi-
mately 15-1/2 to 16 percent. The FHLBB has begun to collect information
1. The increase in the liquidity ratio of S&Ls reflects, in addition to
deposit reflows, the transfer of funds from retail RPs to ASCs, since
securities serving as collateral for an RP cannot be counted as part of
liquidity for regulatory purposes.

III-15
on the proportion of conventional home mortgage loans closed that have
adjustable rate features. The data for both October and November show
that around 30 percent of all conventional loans closed had some such
feature. In November, the proportion was almost 40 percent at S&Ls and
over 50 percent at MSBs. Reflecting the slowness with which secondary
markets for such instruments have developed, conventional mortgages ori-
ginated by mortgage bankers remained almost entirely fixed-rate instru-
ments in November.
Consumer Credit
Expansion of consumer installment credit slowed substantially to a
3-3/4 percent annual rate in October, mainly reflecting the sharp curtail-
ment of automobile financing associated with the low level of new-car sales
in that month. Revolving credit continued to expand moderately, but all
other installment credit contracted. With retail sales sluggish in Novem-
ber and with a further slowdown likely in auto financing, November's over-
all growth in consumer installment debt probably was slight, at most. In-
deed, early estimates suggest a second consecutive month of contraction in
consumer loans at commercial banks in November, following four months of
growth.
Partly as a result of the limited expansion in installment debt since
the beginning of 1980, households in the aggregate appear to have improved
some aspects of their financial positions. The ratio of installment debt
repayments to disposable personal income declined during the third quarter
to its lowest point of the past ten years. In addition, delinquency rates
on installment loans have dropped sharply from cyclical peaks recorded in
the third quarter of 1980. The American Bankers Association series for

delinquencies on closed-end installment credit in the third quarter was
near its lowest point since 1973, and the auto finance companies are
reporting their lowest delinquency rates in nine years.
Series on mortgage delinquencies, in contrast, have risen steadily
in 1981. At S&Ls, the proportion of mortgage loans delinquent 60 days
or more reached 1.44 percent, seasonally adjusted, in October, about 50
basis points above the series low in 1979 and about 10 basis points below
the previous high in 1975. In addition, the Mortgage Bankers Association
series for delinquencies edged to a new high in the third quarter.1
Personal bankruptcies, meanwhile, have been holding at a high level,
in part reflecting the liberalized asset exemptions established by federal
law in late 1979 which made bankruptcy less onerous to debtors. After
drifting down during the first half of this year, bankruptcies turned up
in the third quarter to a level 2 percent above last year's third quarter.
1. Part of the divergence between the mortgage and consumer credit
delinquency trends is attributable to the widely different maturity
structures of the two types of debt. Consumer debt is of much
shorter duration, so that adoption of stringent credit standards by
lenders and belt-tightening efforts of households can more quickly
redress problem loan situations.

Appendix III-A*
THE GROWTH OF MONEY AND BANK CREDIT IN 1981
With the year drawing to a close, it is possible to review in a
preliminary way the 1981 behavior of the monetary aggregates and bank
credit in relation to each other and to interest rates and economic ac-
tivity. While a final appraisal must await at least the availability of
additional and revised data on the aggregates and GNP, it is clear that
there have been some significant departures from historical norms. These
are symptomatic of fundamental changes in financial institutions and
practices--changes that have been induced in large measure by high and
volatile market interest rates against a backdrop of shifting regulatory
controls on the terms at which banks and thrifts can offer deposits.
The following points may be emphasized:
* Demand for M1 has been extraordinarily weak, evidently because
high interest rates have stimulated more intensive use of cash-
economizing techniques.
* Demand for M2 probably has been a shade stronger than might
have been anticipated given the actual behavior of income and
interest rates, owing to spreading use of money market mutual
funds (MMMFs), liberalization of deposit rate ceilings, and to
a small extent the introduction of the All Savers Certificate
(ASC)--factors offsetting the depressing impact of retail RPs.
* M3 growth has been quite rapid in 1981, partly because of a pat-
tern of bank liability management that has favored issuance of
large time deposits to help finance credit expansion.
* The growth of bank credit this year does not in itself appear
unusual. The shortfall of bank credit growth relative to M3
expansion has been a reflection of the growing importance of
MMMFs as intermediaries, diverting funds from depository insti-
tutions and funneling them to a large extent to the commercial
paper market.
Shift-adjusted M1-B this year has been weaker than might be expec-
ted from past relationships of M1-B growth to nominal income and inter-
est rates. In 1981, M1-B has expanded at an annual rate of only 2.0 per-
cent (see Table 1)--the slowest growth for any year since the early
1960s and a bit more than a quarter of the rate posted for this aggre-
gate in 1980, even after allowing for the shift into ATS and related ac-
counts last year.1 NOW accounts increased by a sizable $48-1/4 billion
in 1981, bringing not-shift-adjusted M1-B growth to about 4-3/4 percent.
About $12-1/4 billion of this increase is estimated to have shifted from
interest-earning assets in M2.

III-A-3
This year's narrow money growth (shift-adjusted) has been roughly
6 percentage points weaker than would have been expected on the basis of
standard demand-for-money relationships, such as the one in the Board's
quarterly model. At the retail level, the introduction of NOW accounts
nationwide may have stimulated a general reconsideration of alternative
deposit and nondeposit instruments and thereby intensified the response
to continued high interest rates this year. More generally, direct and
indirect evidence suggests that the M1-B shortfall can be attributed in
large measure to greater use of sophisticated cash management techniques,
more of which seems to be in train. A variant of the Board's money de-
mand equation--containing a variable measuring interest rate expecta-
tions over the intermediate run that is designed to capture the incen-
tive to adopt new cash management methods--predicts the growth in narrow
money quite accurately, on net, in 1981.
In past periods of rising interest rates, M2 velocity has risen,
reflecting disintermediation (see chart). But the composition of M2 has
changed drastically since 1978: its nontransactions component now con-
tains a variety of attractive assets bearing market-related yields.
While the velocity of M1-B has increased dramatically, the velocity of
M2 appears to have decreased somewhat. Instruments that offer market-
determined rates of return have continued to grow rapidly in 1981, insu-
lating M2 from the damping effects of rising interest rates by encourag-
ing investors to keep their funds in financial intermediaries. The
growth of MMMFs has been particularly strong, accounting for almost
three-quarters of the increase in the nontransactions component of M2.
While available data do not permit accurate estimates, the shifting of
funds to MMMFs may have lowered growth in M1-B somewhat. To a small ex-
tent, MMMFs may have been used as direct substitutes for demand deposits
in making payments, but what is more likely the bigger effect, MMMFs
have played a role in making it easier to economize on transactions bal-
ances. To the extent that MMMFs have attracted funds from the open mar-
ket, the effect has been higher M2. The sizable inflows to institution-
only MMMFs--which were likely diverted primarily from non-M2 assets--
suggest that M2 has been boosted significantly by MMMF growth.
Small-denomination time and savings deposit flows in 1981 accoun-
ted for a much smaller proportion of the increase in the nontransactions
component of M2 than in recent years. Net issuance of MMCs was only
about a third of the 1980 flow as rates paid on MMCs exceeded those
available on MMMFs for only two months during the year. In addition,
SSC flows were quite weak until August when the ceiling rate on this in-
strument was uncapped. The October introduction of the ASC augmented
deposit flows only moderately because most of the funds came from sav-
ings and other time deposits. ASCs are estimated to have boosted M2
growth in 1981 by less than .2 percentage points. Finally, outflows
from savings deposits were much greater in 1981 than last year, even
after adjusting for shifts into NOW accounts. Despite the weakness in
deposit flows in 1981 relative to last year, overall deposit growth
probably has been better maintained than past experience would have indi-
cated--despite the MMMF competition--because of the deposit instruments
with yields tied to market interest rates.

The promotion of retail RPs on a substantial scale in 1981 offset
some of the stimuli to M2 growth. The inclusion of retail RPs in M2
would have increased the annual growth rate of this aggregate about
three-quarters of a percentage point; this may exaggerate the RP effect,
however, since some funds may have been diverted from non-M2 assets.
Overnight RPs and Eurodollar deposits contributed less to M2 expansion
in 1981 than in earlier years, as the combined increase in these two
components was quite small.
M3 this year has grown 11-1/4 percent--almost a full percentage
point faster than in 1980 and 1-1/2 percentage points more than the
growth of M2. The decrease in M3 velocity--estimated at just under 2
percent--is the largest over any four-quarter span since 1976. The
growth of retail RPs probably has been an important factor in the diver-
gence of M2 and M3 growth. In addition, however, large-denomination
time deposits, which are the main additional instruments included in M3,
have grown rapidly in 1981, reflecting the need for depository institu-
tions to expand their managed liabilities to offset the weakness in core
deposits. Commercial banks financed the excess of credit expansion over
core deposit growth solely by issuing large CDs, continuing the pattern
of bank liability management that emerged in mid-1980 (see Table 2).
The increase in nondeposit funds was neglible, on net, as other borrow-
ings--consisting primarily of RPs with nonbank lenders--were about equal
in size to the volume of net Eurodollar lending to related offshore
offices. Most of the drop in net Eurodollar borrowing has occurred at
agencies and branches of foreign banks; these institutions have gained
wider acceptance this year in domestic CD markets, encouraging them to
reduce their borrowings from abroad. The cost of domestically issued
CDs relative to borrowing in the Eurodollar interbank market has gener-
ally favored large CD issuance since the middle of last year, boosting
expansion of M3.
Over the first eleven months of 1981, commercial bank credit grew
on balance at an annual rate of 8-3/4 percent, 3/4 percentage points
faster than last year. Most of the acceleration from 1980 was in busi-
ness loans at U.S. offices. In addition, C&I loans to U.S. residents
booked at foreign branches of U.S. banks--not included in the standard
measure of bank credit--increased substantially more in 1981 than last
year owing to the historically wide spread of the prime rate over the
London Interbank Offer Rate. Security acquisitions at banks slowed
markedly in 1981, with the bulk of the slowdown accounted for by U.S.
government obligations.
The growing importance of MMMFs as intermediaries has loosened an
already weak link between the movements of the monetary aggregates and
bank credit. The fact that bank credit has grown considerably less
rapidly than M3 may be said to reflect the fact that MMMFs have channeled
the bulk of their large inflow of funds directly into commercial paper
and other non-monetary assets.

Appendix III-B*
SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES
According to the November 15th Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
on Bank Lending Practices, 26 of the 60 respondents expected business
loan demand to weaken over the next three months, while only 11 antici-
pated stronger demand. Growth of business loans had decelerated in each
month since the August survey, and slack economic activity together with
a pickup in bond issuance may have pointed toward further weakness in
business loan demand.
Although the prime rate dropped by about 350 basis points between
the August and November surveys, the spread of the prime rate over the
more rapidly falling commercial paper rate widened substantially. More-
over, according to the survey, only a limited easing of other terms of
bank lending to business occurred in the August-November period. About
one-fourth of the survey panel relaxed their standards of creditworthi-
ness to qualify for the prime rate, but nearly half as many made such
criteria more stringent. Nearly one-fifth of the banks eased their stan-
dards for given spreads above prime, but almost as many tightened them.
Over one-fourth of the panel reduced compensating balance or fee require-
ments for business loans, but a tenth increased them. In addition, although
only a small number of survey participants reported a more restrictive
stance on lending to new and nonlocal customers, they outnumbered slightly
those who reported an easier stance.
One-fifth of respondents reported in November that over the previ-
ous three months they had become more willing to make installment loans
to individuals. Such respondents outnumbered those who indicated re-
duced willingness for the first time since the August 1980 survey, which
followed the termination of the special credit restraint program. Survey
respondents failed to explain their greater willingness to make consumer
loans, but it may reflect recent declines in market interest rates rela-
tive to usury ceilings.
In answers to supplemental questions, reports of adverse changes
in the financial condition of business borrowers were somewhat more wide-
spread in November than in August and were relatively common among very
large respondents with domestic assets of $5 billion or more. Nearly
three-fifths of respondents reported in November a deterioration over
the previous three months in the financial condition of an above-normal
proportion of customers to whom they had business loans outstanding.1 Of
these banks, about 60 percent indicated that they had reacted both by
requesting additional collateral and by restructuring payment schedules,
while most of the remainder had taken one or the other of these actions.
Many banks specified that in restructuring payments they had reduced or

panel was asked about changes in the financial condition of borrowers

deferred interest or stretched out remittances of principal, but a few
banks indicated that they had asked for accelerated repayment of some
loans. When asked the industries in which the affected borrowers were
concentrated, respondents who had observed an unusual deterioration in
financial condition most often cited manufacturing--especially autos and
related suppliers--and construction.1 The next most frequently cited in-
dustry groups were agribusiness and transportation--specifically airline
and truck operations. Retailing and financial services also received
some mention.
About two-fifths of the survey panel--again, mainly very large
banks--reported a decline over the previous three months in the average
creditworthiness of applicants for new business loan extensions.2 As in
August, about 80 percent of those so reporting indicated that they had
reacted by rejecting a higher proportion of applicants, while the remain-
der said that they had tailored loan agreements appropriately for bor-
rowers in strained financial condition. The distribution of responses
concerning the industries in which the deterioration in creditworthiness
was concentrated was roughly the same for new loan applicants as for cus-
tomers to whom respondents had business loans outstanding.
In November, about one-fifth of respondents reported increases
over the previous three months in delinquency rates on residential mort-
gages and installment loans to individuals. This proportion was
somewhat greater than that for August, when the panel was asked about
changes in delinquency rates over the previous six months. As in August,
those respondents who reported increases in delinquencies indicated that
they had reacted by intensifying their collection efforts, by repossess-
ing collateral, and by restructuring payment schedules.
Over four-fifths of very large banks and two-fifths of other re-
spondents indicated that diversion of business credit demand from long-
term markets had been an important source of business loan demand at
their banks over the previous three months. Of those so reporting, a
plurality indicated that they were satisfying such demand by entering
revolving credit agreements of several years' length, often with borrower
options to convert remaining balances to term loans at the end of the
revolving credit agreement. Such agreements guarantee the borrower a
source of credit for the intermediate term, yet allow refunding of bank
loans with the proceeds of bond and equity issues. About one-fourth of
respondents who reported shifts of credit demands from long-term markets
to their banks indicated simply that they were satisfying such demand
with short-term loans, but they did not specify whether or not these
were takedowns of revolvers. Another one-fourth reported long-term lending.
1. This question was not posed in August.
2. The corresponding figure for August was just under one-third.
3. In August, many panel members commented that delinquency rates actu-
ally had declined over the previous six months; such respondents equalled
(mortgages) or exceeded (installment loans) in number those who reported
increased delinquency rates. In November, very few respondents commented
that delinquency rates had dropped.

S.4 In recent months, demand for business credit at banks apparently has been augmented by credit needs stemming from postpone-
ment of bond issues due to high long-term interest rates. Has this been an important source of business credit demand at
your bank? If so, do such borrowers typically obtain relatively short interim financing--on the order or several months or
less--or loans of greater duration, say several years?

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the last Greenbook the dollar's weighted-average value
in exchange markets has fluctuated in a narrow range. As indicated
in the top panel of the chart, near the end of November the dollar
declined somewhat from its mid-month range, but in early December
renewed strength was evident. At present the dollar's weighted-average
value is about 0.8 percent higher than on November 10.
Against individual currencies the dollar's movements have been
somewhat more pronounced, with gains of from 1-3/4 to 3-1/4 percent
registered against most European currencies and a net depreciation
of about 4-3/4 percent against the Japanese yen. Despite some fluc-
tuations, the dollar's net changes against the Canadian dollar and
the pound sterling were fairly small.
Market reactions to a downturn in U.S. interest rates and the
release of various economic indicators, such as housing starts and
unemployment figures, which underscored the weakness in U.S. activity,
appear to have been the principal influences in the dollar's moderate
decline late in November. Subsequently, in early December the Bundesbank
lowered its lombard rate and the Bank of Japan cut its discount rate,
and market rates fell slightly in several foreign centers. In addition,
upward revisions in estimates of the U.S. budget deficit for 1982
and expectations of a large increase in the M2 money supply contributed
to a backing up of U.S. interest rates and to the dollar's more buoyant
tendency toward mid-month. The relatively favorable consumer price
data released in late November may also have contributed to a downward

revision in U.S. inflation expectations. Other factors having some
influence on exchange-rate developments during this interval included
perceptions of budget and political problems in Germany, the Polish
situation, persistent problems with the formation of a government in
Belgium and, toward the end of the period, threats of labor difficulties
in the United Kingdom.
Early this week, following the declaration of martial law
in Poland and accompanying uncertainty about what turn that situation
would take next, the dollar briefly shot above the DM 2.35 level
and also advanced sharply against other major currencies. Gold climbed
into the $430 range. However, these gains were eroded quickly once

spread for the past five weeks, and last week the Dutch guilder and
French franc likewise moved near the top. The German mark was close
to its lower limit until recently, but subsequently was replaced
by the Belgian franc, which came under speculative pressure while the
Belgians struggled to form a new government. This considerable pressure
kept the franc at its lower intervention floor
On December 10 the
Belgian National Bank raised both its discount and securities-advances'
rates by 2 percentage points. After last weekend, reports that a
Belgian government would be formed by former Prime Minister Martens
brought the franc off its lower intervention floor. Shortly there-
after, the Belgian National Bank moved forcefully to drive up short-
term interest rates to very high levels, and the franc catapulted to
the top of the EMS currency spread, where it remained at mid-week,
.Despite
these developments, there continue to be rumors of an eventual
realignment of EMS central rates involving a Belgian franc devaluation.

OPEC surpluses and investment flows. In the first half of 1981 the
OPEC current-account surplus is estimated at $44 billion, almost the same
as in the second half of 1980. (See table.) Oil exports of $138 billion
in the first half of 1981 were as large as in the previous six months;
although the volume of oil exports declined, the average OPEC official
sales price for crude oil increased by almost 8 percent, to $34.74 per
barrel, in the first half of this year. At the same time, the rate of
growth of OPEC imports in dollar terms slowed markedly, in part reflecting
the 13.3 percent rise in the exchange rate of the dollar compared with
the second half of 1980. OPEC imports in the first half of 1981 rose only
$2 billion (3 percent) from the previous six months, compared with 15 per-
cent in the preceding half year and 30 percent in 1980 as a whole.
In contrast to the foregoing, the second half of 1981 is expected to
show an abrupt decline in the OPEC current-account surplus, to the level
of $18 billion. Weakening demand for oil is expected to bring oil exports
down to $125 billion, $13 billion below the first-half level, the decrease
being partly reflected in reduced volume and partly in lower prices. Con-
currently, OPEC imports are projected to rise much more rapidly, to a
level about $11 billion (15 percent) above that of the first half of the
year and 24 percent higher than a year earlier, because of a smaller rise
in the dollar and disappearance of certain factors depressing imports in
the first half. For 1981 as a whole the OPEC current account surplus is
projected at $62 billion. However, deficits will be incurred by Iraq
(because of the war with Iran), Nigeria, and on a smaller scale by Iran
and Algeria.
The pattern of new OPEC investments in the first six months of 1981
underwent several changes, the most striking being the much smaller share

going into new Eurocurrency deposits than in earlier years. Additions to
OPEC Eurocurrency deposits (together with domestic currency deposits in
countries other than the United States and United Kingdom) amounted to
only $3.8 billion, down from $18.5 billion in the preceding half-year.
The flow into these deposits was equivalent to less than 10 percent of
the OPEC current-account surplus, compared with an average of close to
40 percent in both 1980 and the entire period 1974-80. The percentage of
the current-account surplus going into assets in the United Kingdom
(excluding Eurocurrency deposits in that country) also dropped sharply in
the first half of 1981 compared with 1980 as a whole.
Higher shares of total OPEC external investments in the first six
months of this year were accounted for by flows to the United States and
to other industrial countries. The inflow into the United States came to
$7.6 billion, equivalent to 17 percent of the current-account surplus
compared with a 15 percent share in 1980 and only 9 percent in the second
half of last year. Net purchases of U.S. securities other than Treasury
bills increased to $8.2 billion, a step-up of more than 25 percent com-
pared with the average half-yearly rate in 1980. In the third quarter,
the rate of OPEC investment flows to the United States tapered off and
holdings of Treasury bills and bank deposits were drawn down, but the
rate of flow into other U.S. securities rose further.
Industrial countries other than the United States and United Kingdom
absorbed $11 billion of OPEC investment flows (excluding additions to bank
deposits) in the first half of 1981. This was equivalent to 25 percent of
the current-account surplus, substantially higher than the 16 percent
share taken by these countries in 1980. Long-term capital flows to

Germany, amounting to $5.1 billion, were about the same as in the last
half of 1980 in dollar terms (while rising 35 percent in DM terms) and
again were almost entirely borrowings by the German public sector.

The U.S. merchandise trade deficit increased sharply in October,
returning to the high level recorded in August. For four months in a
row the trade deficit has swung widely. However, the combined
September-October deficit was about the same as the combined July-
August deficit; both were larger than deficits recorded in the first
two quarters of this year. Since the second quarter, the value of
exports has declined while the value of imports (other than oil) has
risen.

Despite a slowing in U.S. economic activity in the third quarter,
the value and volume of nonoil imports rose in both July-August and in
September-October. The increase was fairly evenly spread among items
in most major commodity categories -- particularly consumer goods,
capital goods, and industrial supplies. The value of steel imports
declined in September and October from the record August level, but
remained high; much of the increase in steel imports during the last
three months was from the European Community. The volume of foreign
cars imported increased sharply in October from a low September level,
but for September-October combined imports were about 8 percent below
the July-August rate. July-August foreign car imports were at almost
the same rate as during the first and second quarters but were about
15 percent less than last year's peak third-quarter rate.
Oil imports have increased slightly since July, but remain below
the average rate for the first half of 1981. The low level of imports
is due in part to a drawdown of inventories; the U.S. stock of crude
oil and petroleum products (seasonally adjusted) continued to ease
downward through November. The price of oil imports continued to
decline through October, with the October average price about $3.80
per barrel below the peak April price. Trade data do not yet reflect
price increases made by Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Mexico, and North Sea
producers in October (more than offsetting some price cuts by other
exporters during the last two months) and oil import prices are
expected to recover to about $34 per barrel by next spring.

Agricultural exports increased from the low July-August rate of
$39 billion to a rate of $43 billion in September-October. Export
prices continued the decline begun at the beginning of the year; from
January to October average export prices fell 13 percent. The
September-October upturn in exports resulted from a pick-up in the
volume of shipments, particularly wheat and corn exports to the Soviet
Union and soybean exports to Japan. The volume exported in September-
October was almost as large as in the strong first quarter.
Nonagricultural exports have declined since the second quarter.
From the second quarter through October the largest declines have been
in civilian aircraft exports and in automotive exports to Canada.
Industrial supplies and machinery exports (which together account for
two-thirds of nonagricultural exports) ceased to expand and have begun
to decline marginally; about 17 percent of these exports are shipped to
Canada, 25 percent to the EC, and 8 percent each to Japan and Mexico.
International capital account transactions reflect the increasing
integration of U.S. and offshore financial markets: U.S. nonbanks
increased both their borrowing from and deposits in banks offshore and
foreigners sharply increased their borrowing in the U.S. capital market.
Credit extended to U.S. nonbanks by the foreign offices of U.S. banks
has continued to rise during a period when the LIBOR-prime spread has
favored LIBOR-pricing. (See chart.) Funding for such loans may have

come from U.S. sources: net advances to foreign offices have risen
since August (see line 1(b) of the table below) and deposits of bank
holding companies at their foreign subsidiary banks have increased by
about $3 billion between June and October, 1981. These flows probably
reflect the relative attractiveness of funding through U.S. CD's and
commercial paper compared to Eurodollar borrowing.

Data on U.S. nonbanks' borrowing from the foreign offices of
foreign banks are not available on a systematic basis. Although foreign
and U.S.-based banks are not necessarily affected in identical ways by
certain considerations (e.g. reserve requirements and taxes), one
would expect that foreign banks would also book part of their LIBOR-
based loans to U.S. residents offshore. Documents filed in connection

IV-14
with recent corporate takeover programs have confirmed this. Foreign
banks were scheduled to provide $5.4 billion out of the total of $11
billion of syndicated bank facilities for Dupont, U.S. Steel, and
Marathon Oil. Of 27 foreign banks involved in those facilities, 21
have indicated that they would book offshore those portions of the
loans based on LIBOR. In addition, three foreign banks said even
prime-based drawdowns would be booked abroad. As much as $4.2 billion
of the foreign banks' share was subject to offshore booking. The
recent declines in foreign-based banks' positions vis-a-vis their own
foreign offices shown in line 1 (c) of the table above may be related
to increased lending to U.S. nonbanks from foreign banks' overseas
offices, funded in part by reductions in net advances to U.S. offices.
Another source of funding may have been the proceeds of commercial
paper issued in the United States by parent organizations of foreign
banks.
Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbanks increased again in September.
(See line 3 of table above.) Most of the expansion was in the form of
negotiable CDs, the great bulk of which are issued by London branches
of U.S. banks. Among the important holders of such London-branch
instruments are money-market mutual funds (MMMF) and unit investment
trusts (UIT), whose portfolios have recently contained upwards of 60
percent of the estimated total of all negotiable Eurodollar CD's held
by U.S. nonbanks. Since mid-September, MMMF and UIT holdings of
Eurodollar CD's have expanded by nearly $3 billion.

IV-15
Foreign bond issues in the United States during the third and
fourth quarters together appear likely to exceed placements during the
first six months of 1981 by at least 20 percent, and for the year as a
whole the total of such issues will approach a figure double the $3.5
billion offered in 1980. After U.S. interest rates began to decline,
private Canadian borrowing in the U.S. capital market expanded from a
monthly rate of about $325 million during the third quarter to a rate
of over $500 million during October and November. Canadians were not
the only borrowers to respond to lower long-term interest rates in the
U.S. market during October and November. Other issuers of foreign
securities increased their offerings from a third-quarter monthly
rate of about $85 million to a rate of nearly $500 million a month
during October and November.
Foreign official reserves assets in the United States declined
in both September and October. Increases in OPEC holdings were more
than offset by declines in holdings of the G-10 countries and Switzer-
land. These declines were associated with intervention sales of dollars.
The reduction in official holdings in October was concentrated in
assets other than U.S. Treasury securities. (See table on U.S.
International Transactions.) Official holders appear to have responded
to expected future declines in U.S. interest rates by shifting out
of short-term investments and into Treasury obligations of more than
one year's maturity. Partial data through late November, based on
holdings at the FRBNY, indicate a further increase of over $2.5
billion in foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, of

IV-16
which somewhat under $1 billion was for the account of OPEC members.

International Developments. The growth of real GNP in the major
foreign industrial countries was weak in the third quarter. Even Japan's
GNP grew at only half the rate of the second quarter. In France, where
second-quarter growth had been unusually strong, the third-quarter rate
was also much lower. In the United Kingdom GNP growth was positive in
the third quarter after two years of decline, but the level of production
remains depressed. Canada and Italy recorded sharp declines of GNP in
the third quarter. Industrial production in Germany, where third-quarter
seasonally adjusted GNP data are not yet available, remains flat. Un-
employment in most countries has been rising more rapidly in recent
months, reaching a levelof nearly 10 million in West Europe. Especially
high rates of unemployment were observed in Belgium, the United Kingdom
and the Netherlands. Despite the general weakness of economic activity,
consumer price inflation abroad has continued to rise in October and
November at rates which were roughly equal to or higher than those in
the third quarter. Japan's current account has moved further into
surplus and Germany's deficit has continued to decline in recent months.
In response to the weakness of economic activity and aided by
lower interest rates in the United States, official interest rates have
been lowered in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, real GNP grew by 2.4 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, after 4.8 percent growth in the second
quarter. The slowdown of growth reflects weakness in all components of
domestic demand, which actually declined by 0.8 percent. The growth of
real net exports remained very strong in the third quarter, although
somewhat reduced from the second quarter. In contrast to this generally

weak third quarter picture, industrial production made strong gains
in September and October.
Consumer prices in the third quarter were slightly below their
second-quarter level. This declining trend was reversed in October-
November, with monthly CPI increases of about 0.3 percent,but wholesale
prices declined in each of those months. Slower growth in dollar prices
for imported materials (including oil) has been an important factor
offsetting the effects of a weakening yen earlier this year.
The seasonally adjusted current account showed a $1.5 billion
surplus in October, which brings the cumulative surplus for the first
ten months of 1981 to $5.2 billion. The government announced in late
November that it is considering advancing by two years, to 1982, the
import tariff cuts scheduled to take place in 1983-1984 under the Tokyo
Round. In addition, some other measures to open the Japanese markets
to imports are under discussion. Effective December 11, the Bank of
Japan lowered its official discount rate by 0.75 percentage points to
5.5 percent.
German industrial production in October was unchanged from its
low September level. Economic activity thus remains at the low level to
which it had fallen in the course of last year. Preliminary non-
seasonally adjusted data indicate a small gain of third-quarter real
GNP on the second quarter. The increase in the rate of unemployment,
which had been moderate in the early phase of the prolonged current
period of weak activity, has been accelerating since early this year.
The previous post-war record of 5.2 percent (mid-year 1975) was passed

in May. Since then, the rate has risen to 6.5 percent (s.a.) in
November, which amounts to 1-1/2 million unemployed.
The rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index,
has been about 5 percent (annual rate) in the last three months in-
cluding November. This rate, however, has been held down by seasonal
factors. Seasonally adjusted, the annual rate in the three months to
October was 7.7 percent. Wholesale prices in the three months to
November rose at an annual rate of 7 percent. An important factor
contributing to the inflation picture has been the steep rise of import
prices (16 percent annual rate in the first three quarters this year),
which reflect the weakness until recently of the D-mark exchange rate.
The German current account was in surplus ($1.3 billion) in October for
the first time since April 1979. The cumulative 1981 deficit through
October was $8.7 billion (n.s.a.) compared to $16.1 billion last year.
On December 3 the Bundesbank announced its monetary target for
1982, 4-7 percent growth of Central Bank Money from the fourth quarter of
this year to the fourth quarter of next year. The new target is thus
unchanged from this year's target. The growth of Central Bank Money was
below the bottom of this year's range in November. The Bundesbank also
reduced its Special Lombard rate from 11 to 10.5 percent on December 3.
French GDP continued to grow in the third quarter of 1981; how-
ever, the over 1.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) growth was well below the nearly
5 percent growth which occurred in the second quarter. Third-
quarter growth was supported almost exclusively by consumption growth of
4.5 percent. Whereas investment by private firms grew by 6 percent in
1980, there has been a decline of nearly 4,5 percent (a.r.) so far this
year.

IV -23
Unemployment has risen in France from over 1.5 million (s.a.)
in January to over 1.8 million in November. The unemployment rate has
risen from under seven percent to over eight percent in November.
Consumer price inflation during the last three months, including
November, was over 13 percent (a.r.). The CPI for that period was over
14 percent above its level a year ago.
The current-account deficit for the first three quarters of this
year was $4.7 billion compared to nearly $6 billion for the first
three quarters last year.
French M2, although falling slightly in September, has grown at
an annual rate of nearly 14.5 percent (s.a.) for the first three
quarters of 1981. Interest rates in France have been falling steadily
over the past two months. Credit controls seem to be less binding now
than at any time during the year according to subjective evaluations by
firms. In addition, the premium at which banks trade credit allocations
among themselves, the "prime de desencadrement", which was above 6 per-
cent in late September, was below 2 percent in mid-November.
The budget deficit in the 1982 draft budget, FF95 billion, is
well above the FF30 billion in the 1981 draft budget and somewhat above
a forecast FF70 billion deficit outturn for this year. Real government
expenditure is planned to increase by over 26 percent compared with the
original 1981 budget.
In the third quarter of 1981, preliminary data indicate that real
GDP in the United Kingdom rose 1.2 percent (s.a.a.r.), the first quarterly
increase in real GDP in the United Kingdom since the final quarter of

1979. Industrial production in the three-month period ending October
1981 was 7 percent (s.a.a.r.) above the level recorded in the preceding
three-month period. Thus it appears that the prolonged decline in U.K.
economic activity has come to an end. However, production is still at
depressed levels and the unemployment rate continues to climb, reach-
ing 11.4 percent in November. Between the fourth quarter of 1980 and the
second quarter of 1981, output per person employed in the U.K. economy
rose over 3-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.), and in manufacturing it increased
some 10 percent.
On December 2, 1981, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Geoffrey Howe
announced some changes in the U.K. government's fiscal plans for
FY1982-83, which will begin in April 1982. The net result is that the
level of real government spending in FY1982-83 is now planned to be
about the same as in the present fiscal year. (In his March budget
message, Sir Geoffrey had originally announced the intention to cut real
government spending by some 2 percent in FY1982-83.) In addition, the
Chancellor announced an increase in the social security tax rate paid by
employees, effective at the beginning of the next fiscal year. Sir
Geoffrey did not present an estimate of the expected public sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR) in FY1982-83 resulting from the announced
fiscal measures. (This year's PSBR is still forecast to be £10-1/2
billion -- 4-1/4 percent of GDP.)
In Canada, real GNP fell roughly 4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
third quarter of this year. Excluding inventory accumulation the de-
cline in real GNP was 7.6 percent, representing the most severe decline

IV -25
since 1951. The sharp decline in real GNP during the third quarter was
broadly based. Real consumption fell by 3.6 percent and real private
investment fell 18.4 percent (s.a.a.r.). This decline in final demand
played a major role in the more than $1 billion increase in inventory
accumulation from about $642 million in the second quarter to roughly
$1.7 billion in the third quarter.
Despite the third-quarter decline in real growth, inflation
still remains high. In October the CPI index was about 12.7 percent
higher than a year ago.
In the third quarter, the current-account deficit rose almost
$500 million to $2.2 billion. The deficit for the first three quarters
of this year was over $5 billion, compared with $1.6 billion for all of
1980.
In Italy economic activity remains weak. Real GDP fell by 6.4
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter after a 4.8 percent decline in
the previous quarter. Both consumption and investment spending declined
in real terms this year. At the beginning of the third quarter, the un-
employment rate was 8.8 percent; based on the increase in unemployment
benefits paid, the current rate is probably over 9 percent(over 2
million unemployed).
The inflation rate for consumer prices remains high; in November
consumer prices rose by 1.7 percent to a level 18.2 percent above their
year-earlier level. The weakness of the domestic economy has produced
an improvement in the trade account: in the three month period ending
in October, the trade deficit was about $3-3/4 billion compared with a
deficit of $8-1/2 billion during the same period a year ago.

IV -26
Talks between the government and the labor unions concerning the
reform of the wage indexation system continue. In August, wages in
industry were about 24 percent above their year-earlier level. During
the same period, public sector wages grew by 35 percent.
In the Benelux countries further increases in unemployment indi-
cate continued weakness of real activity. In Belgium unemployment in
September reached 14.6 percent (n.s.a.) of the insured labor force, up
almost 3 percentage points from the level of September 1980. Never-
theless, the National Bank of Belgium raised its official lending rates
2 percentage points on December 11 in response to continued pressure
against the Belgian franc. In the Netherlands unemployment in
October rose 0.4 percentage points to 9.9 percent (s.a.). This level
represents a steady increase in the rate from its January 1981 level
of 7.2 percent. The reduced level of domestic activity has helped to
restrain import demand and led to a current account surplus of $1
billion (s.a.) for the first half of 1981 compared with a deficit of
$2.4 billion for 1980 as a whole.
