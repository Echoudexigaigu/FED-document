The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Several key indicators suggest that the recent decline in economic
activity has slowed. Production, employment, and consumer demand in
February were only a little below their levels at the end of 1981, and
housing activity has edged up for several months. Moreover, the volume
and rapidity of the inventory liquidation suggest a near-term rebound
in activity. At the same time, however, outlays for business fixed
investment have continued to drop, and indicators of future business
spending suggest further weakness in that sector. The price situation
has continued to improve, particularly in the energy area.
Industrial Production
The index of industrial production increased 1.6 percent in
February, reflecting some rebound in activity from the sharply curtailed
output levels in January that resulted in part from severe weather.
Following the February rebound, the index remained 1.0 percent below its
level at the end of 1981. Although the overall picture is one of
continuing production adjustments, the rate of output decline from
December to February was notably smaller than during the preceding four
months.
Output of consumer goods increased 1.7 percent in February, almost
offsetting the January drop. Autos were assembled at a 4.1 million unit
annual rate, still extremely weak, but up about 14 percent from the
January pace. With dealer's stocks substantially reduced, industry
schedules for March currently indicate a rise in the assembly rate to
around 5.0 million units and a further increase in April. Output of
durable home goods, such as furniture and appliances, also increased in

February, and was at a level slightly above that at the end of last
year. For the materials group, production increased 1.8 percent in
February, recovering much of the January decline; output of energy
materials increased further, despite some drop in crude oil and natural
gas extraction. However, production of business equipment continued
weak in February, rising only 0.5 percent following a sharp drop in the
preceding month; the February increase was damped in part by a slowing
in oil and gas well drilling activity.
Employment
Production adjustments over the December-February period were
mirrored in recent labor market developments. Total employment was
virtually flat between December and February, following a period when
mounting layoffs, especially among manufacturing workers, had driven the
unemployment rate from 7.2 percent in July 1981 to 8.8 percent by the
end of the year. By February, the adult male jobless rate had edged
lower, but this was offset by further increases in joblessness among
teenagers and minority groups, leaving the overall unemployment rate at
8.8 percent. Since mid-February initial claims for unemployment
insurance remained high, suggesting that labor market conditions for
experienced workers are still quite unfavorable.
Declines in total payroll employment also moderated early this
year, although weakness persisted among many goods-producing industries.
Between December and February, nonfarm employment fell 175,000; during
the preceding three months job losses averaged 300,000 per month.
Construction employment, while rising in February, regained only a
portion of January's weather-related loss, leaving jobs in this sector

45,000 below the December level. At manufacturers, employment cutbacks
continued in February, but the decline of 45,000 was small in comparison
with an average monthly loss of 170,000 factory jobs between July and
January. In the service-producing sector, employment rose 70,000 in
February despite the falling number of government jobs. The manufac-
tures' workweek also recovered last month from the effects of January's
severe weather, rebounding to 39.1 hours, slightly above its December
level. Nonetheless, the index of aggregate hours worked in the goods-
producing sector, which reflects changes in employment as well as weekly
hours of production workers, did not fully return to its December level.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Nominal personal income grew at only a 4-1/4 percent annual rate
over the first two months of this year. Stagnant labor demand, declines
in proprietors' incomes, and a sharp rise in personal contributions for
social insurance, an item that is deducted in computing total personal
income, held down income growth in this period. At the same time,
disposable personal income was boosted by reductions in nonwithheld
tax liabilities legislated last year. In real terms, disposable income
in February appears to have recovered most of its January decline. The
saving rate declined to 5.0 percent early this year--below its level
prior to last fall's tax cut--as consumption expenditures increased more
than disposable income.
February retail sales in real terms appear to be slightly below
the December level. Outside the automotive area, sales of consumer items
rose more than 1 percent in current dollars in February, offsetting the
weather-related drop in January. At auto dealers, sales of domestic

models rose to a 6.2 million unit annual rate, 600,000 units above the
pace in January. February sales were boosted by fairly large rebates
available from all U.S. manufacturers, primarily on a wide variety of
compact and subcompact models. Sales of these smaller cars increased
more than 20 percent in February, while sales of large and intermediate
cars remained unchanged. Sales during the first 10 days of March were at
a disappointing 5.9 million unit annual rate, despite the continuation
of the rebate programs. Foreign car sales in February, at a 2.3
million unit annual rate, remained close to their recent sales pace.
The continued sluggishness in growth of household spending is
consistent with the February surveys of consumer attitudes. Both the
University of Michigan and Conference Board measures of confidence moved
lower in February, following some improvement around the turn of the
year. Opinions about market conditions for buying homes and automobiles,
according to the Michigan survey, remained near the record lows of the
last year. Pessimism about buying conditions centered on both high
interest rates and high prices.
Housing
Total private housing starts rose 6-1/2 percent in February to an
annual rate of 953,000 units. And newly-issued permits for residential
building also were up slightly, the fourth consecutive monthly increase.
Most of these advances since the end of last year were in the multi-
family sector. For both of these indicators, the first two months of
1982 were above their recent lows registered in the final quarter of
1981, but housing activity has remained quite depressed. Housing starts
in February were below the million unit annual rate for the seventh

straight month, by far the longest such period since World War II. Both
new and existing home sales fell in January, reflecting bad weather in
many areas of the country and high mortgage interest rates.
The severity of the downturn in housing activity has had a strong
effect on house prices. The trend in measured prices of houses sold has
been weakening for some time. In January 1982, the average sales prices
of new houses and of existing houses sold were about 1 percent and 5-1/2
percent, respectively, above a year earlier; this compares with 11-1/2
percent increases for both measures over the preceding year. The recent
moderation in house price increases reflects proportionately greater
purchases of smaller, less expensive units along with traditional demand-
induced price adjustments. Slack demand also has translated into a
slowing in the growth of construction costs, which increased less than
7-1/2 percent during the four quarters of 1981 (see chart).
Business Fixed Investment
Capital spending has weakened further, following a moderate fourth
quarter decline. In the equipment category, shipments of nondefense
capital goods, a measure of about 80 percent of producers' durable
equipment, rose 4 percent in February, offsetting only about half
January's record decline. Shipments of these goods were more than 2
percent below their already low fourth quarter average. In addition,
sales of heavy trucks in February fell back to the low levels that
prevailed around the end of last year. In the structures category,
overall expenditures on new construction held up fairly well through
January.

Commitments data indicate a further decline in capital expendi-
tures in the near-term. Contracts and orders for plant and equipment,
a leading indicator of overall capital spending, fell 2-1/4 percent in
nominal terms in January. In the equipment category, orders for
nondefense capital goods declined 1-3/4 percent in February, the third
consecutive monthly decline. Additionally, contracts for nonresiden-
tial building declined somewhat in January, and permits for nonresiden-
tial construction dropped over 14 percent.
A number of longer-term indicators also suggest continued weakness.
The Commerce Department's most recent survey of plant and equipment
expenditures reports that business plans to increase capital outlays
only 7.3 percent in 1982, implying a 1 percent decline in real terms.
McGraw-Hill also reported in a recent "checkup" on capital spending that
business plans to increase current dollar expenditures 6.9 percent in
1982, meaning a reduction in real terms. The Conference Board's survey
of capital appropriations and expenditures reports that the nations'
1,000 largest manufacturers reduced their capital appropriations, net of
cancellations, 22 percent in the fourth quarter of 1981, following a
small reduction in the third quarter. In addition, capacity utilization
in manufacturing in February, at only about 72 percent and extremely low
on an historical basis, indicates the lack of immediate need for
additional productive capacity.
Inventory Investment
Despite weakening final sales, production adjustments of the last
few months have resulted in a considerable reduction of inventories. In
December and January, manufacturing and trade inventories were cut at

annual rates of $18.9 and a record $27.8 billion 1972 dollars,
respectively. However, the stock-sales ratio for total manufacturing
and trade actually rose to 1.79 in January, reflecting the 2.3 percent
decline in real shipments and sales.
In the manufacturing sector, constant dollar inventories fell at
about a $12-1/2 billion annual rate in December after rising for five
consecutive months. Liquidation in January was at a $13 billion annual
rate, despite the sharp decline in shipments. Most key industries,
especially those in the durable goods category, reported sizable
reductions in stocks in both months.
Retailers' inventories fell at a $12 billion annual rate in real
terms in January; this was the third consecutive monthly decline.
Reductions in retailers' inventories of automobiles and parts made a
major contribution to this liquidation as stocks of U.S.-made autos at
dealers fell by about 300,000 units between October and February--a
result of sharp production cutbacks and rebate programs. In February,
stocks represented a 63 days supply.
Federal Government
The federal government deficit in January and February was smaller
than expected, and the Treasury has cut about $10 billion from the $41
billion of financing that it had originally scheduled for the first
quarter. The lower deficit can be traced mainly to a slowing in federal
spending as well as somewhat earlier remittance of tax payments. Growth
in defense spending was interrupted as outlays registered a substantial
decline from the peak recorded in the fourth quarter of 1981; the decline
was especially pronounced for operations and maintenance activities.

Commodity Credit Corporation loan activities also declined in February
and early March, following exceptionally high levels in January and
the fourth quarter of last year.
Outlays for a number of income assistance programs also have
remained constant or declined. Cuts in benefit levels and tighter
eligibility standards enacted in last year's Reconciliation Act have
operated to offset the cyclical tendency for higher spending in these
areas. However, unemployment compensation payments, which have by far
the greatest cyclical sensitivity, did increase steadily in January and
February, and daily Treasury data indicate additional increases in early
March. The growth in these reflects the sharp increase in the number of
individuals receiving extended unemployment benefits, from about 40,000
at the end of December to 277,000 for the week ending February 27. This
rise can be attributed in large part to an increase in the number of
states qualifying for extended benefits from 6 in late December to 29 by
late-March.
On the receipts side of the budget, both corporate and nonwithheld
individual income tax receipts were larger than expected early this year,
probably in response to a rise in the interest rate that the IRS charges
on late payments; this increase, from 12 to 20 percent, became effective
February 1.
The Administration unveiled its FY1983 budget in early February;
this indicated a FY1982 deficit of $99 billion and projected a deficit
of $92 billion for 1983. The Budget is described in Appendix II-A, which
also discusses Congressional Budget Office estimates and other recent
budget proposals.

II-22
State and Local Government
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local govern-
ments appear to have fallen sharply since year end, after leveling off
in the final months of 1981. Compensation for state and local
employees, which accounts for more than one-half of state and local
spending, probably declined in real terms in the first quarter, reflect-
ing reductions in employment levels in the first two months of the year.
State and local construction decreased 3-1/2 percent in real terms in
January, as spending for water supply and sewer projects fell sharply.
The contraction in overall economic activity is causing budgetary
problems for numerous states. Twenty-one states report that revenues
during the current fiscal year have fallen short of official forecasts,
which are generally on the conservative side. More than half the states
expect to conclude the current fiscal year with deficits or only small
surpluses, increasing the chances that taxes will be raised or expendi-
tures reduced in the next few months.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage inflation has moderated during the past year; in the first
two months of 1982 the hourly earnings index for production workers was
8 percent above a year earlier, down from a peak twelve-month rise of
nearly 10 percent from early 1980 to early 1981. In comparison, there
was no appreciable slowing of wage increases in either the 1970 or 1980
recession. During the 1973-75 recession, the year-over-year rise in the
earnings index moderated by about 2-1/4 percentage points, only slightly
more than the deceleration seen in the past year. However, wage infla-
tion for white-collar workers, which may be less cyclically sensitive,
remained relatively rapid last year--rising more than 9 percent.

II-23
The recent wage concessions by union and nonunion workers at
financially-troubled firms have not yet had a significant impact on
aggregate wage series, but these new agreements should contribute to a
further slowing of wage increases in the years ahead. The Teamsters'
settlement provided for wage increases during the next three years
that average less than inflation. In addition, nonunion employees at
GM and Ford agreed to a pay freeze in 1982, and Ford's union workers
agreed to defer each of three-cost-of-living increases due this year
for 18 months and to eliminate usual annual improvement increases for
the next two years. A tentative settlement containing wage and benefit
provisions similar to those arranged at Ford appears likely to be
accepted by UAW members at GM as well.
Hourly compensation, the measure of labor costs that most directly
affects prices, also moderated during 1981, despite a large increase in
Social Security taxes; compensation per hour rose 9.2 percent over the
year compared with a 10.1 percent increase over 1980. However, there
were no productivity gains last year to offset the rise in labor costs.
Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector fell 3/4 percent in 1981,
in large part due to a huge drop at the end of last year. The fourth
quarter decline was typical of those occurring at early stages of a
downturn when sharp production adjustments exceed cuts in employment.
Prices
Recent price reports indicate a further slowing of inflation
despite a pickup in the rate of increase in food prices. The CPI rose
only 0.3 percent in January and 0.2 percent in February, while the PPI
for finished goods actually declined 0.1 percent in February after a

II-24
0.4 percent advance the previous month. Falling prices of petroleum
and its products as well as rebates on motor vehicles have been
important factors in the recent price deceleration. Nevertheless, the
moderation in other sectors appears significant and quite widespread.
In the energy area, crude petroleum prices dropped 8-1/2 percent
between their peak in February 1981 and January 1982. This decline,
coupled with weakening demand for refined products, has led to large
reductions in gasoline prices in both January and February, a trend
which is likely to continue into the spring.
In contrast to energy, prices of farm products turned up early
this year, following steep declines through most of 1981; retail food
prices also have risen faster than in the fourth quarter. Consumer
prices of fresh fruits and vegetables soared in January, as the freeze
in Florida and smaller harvests of some California crops curtailed
supplies; and rose further in February. Bad weather and planned pro-
duction cutbacks have combined to push livestock prices up considerably
in early 1982, and began to boost prices at the retail level in
February. Even with the recent upturn, farm product prices remain sub-
stantially below their year-earlier levels.
Outside the food and energy categories, the CPI rise in February
was held down by a drop in new car prices resulting from the widespread
rebates. The rise in prices of consumer commodities excluding food,
energy, and houses was 0.2 percent in February, following increases
averaging about 0.5 percent in each of the preceding three months.
Prices of consumer services excluding energy and home financing, which
rose sharply throughout most of 1981, increased just 0.5 percent in
February, with the slowing fairly widespread.

The homeownership component of the CPI has had little impact on
the overall index in recent months. After dipping in January, the
house price, measure was up slightly in February. At the same time, the
CPI measure of the mortgage rate has remained about unchanged since
November.
At the producer level, the index for finished goods excluding
food and energy items rose 0.5 percent in January and was unchanged in
February. Lower prices for cars and light trucks cut the February rise
by about one percentage point. Price increases for other items, notably
capital equipment, have slowed from the 1981-Q4 pace. Prices of inter-
mediate materials excluding food and energy items have practically
leveled off over the last few months, as demand has weakened.

Appendix II-A*
THE FEDERAL BUDGET
I. Introduction
The Administration's federal budget proposals for fiscal years
1983, 1984, and 1985 were presented to Congress in February. Projected
budget deficits under laws currently enacted are of unprecedented size.
Consequently, the Administration has proposed substantial further deficit-
reducing measures to supplement last year's nondefense program reductions.
Several alternative budgetary measures have been proposed by members of
Congress. In the following section, current services estimates of outlays,
receipts, and the deficit, computed by the Administration and by the Con-
gressional Budget Office (CBO), are presented. In the final section,
Administration and Congressional proposals to reduce the current services
deficit are discussed.
II. Current Services Budget
In order to provide a base against which budgetary alternatives
may be assessed, it is useful to have a benchmark that represents what
might happen to the budget if no changes in current laws or policies
were made. The "current services" budget provides such a baseline.
In the construction of this budget, the effects of projected inflation
on receipts and outlays are generally taken into account. In the case
of discretionary (non-entitlement) programs, as well as formally indexed
programs, cost estimates are usually raised to provide maintenance of
the program levels in real terms. In previous budget projections, the
current services budget (in nominal terms) always showed a tendency to
move quickly into surplus. Revenue growth due to the combination of
relatively high tax rates and a progressive rate structure applied to
nominal incomes outpaced growth of outlays even though these outlays were
raised in pace with forecast inflation. In contrast, this year's esti-
mates project rising current services deficits because the Economic
Recovery Tax Act of 1981 will sharply reduce the growth of taxes relative
to previous periods; additionally, the Administration has redefined cur-
rent services outlays to include proposed increases in defense spending
that are thought necessary to achieve "adequate" levels.
A comparison of current services budgets of the Administration and
CBO is presented in Table 1; a comparison of the economic assumptions
underlying these budgets is found in Table 2. Between FY192 and FY1985,
the Administration and CBO both show current service revenues and outlays
falling as a percentage of GNP. In contrast, the current services deficit
as a percent of GNP rises over the period. This increase results from an
average annual growth in outlays of approximately 10 percent, which exceeds
the average annual growth in revenues of 7 to 8 percent. In the absence
of any subsequent policy changes, the 1983-1985 deficits would be the lar-
gest in post-war history, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of

GNP. As a result, the Administration and numerous Congressional members
have proposed substantial deficit-reducing measures.
III. Alternative Budget Initiatives
The Administration's deficit reducing initiatives are summarized in
Table 3. On the revenue side, taxes are increased primarily through
proprosals such as a new corporate minimum tax and elimination of completed
contract accounting (in which contractors may defer tax on income until
the year that the contract is completed even when income is received
throughout the term of the contract). In addition, there are proposals
to tighten the collection and the enforcement of existing taxes, such as
withholding on dividends and interest.
Outlay reductions (relative to a current services baseline) are
three to four times larger than the tax increases. Major outlay savings
are proposed through entitlement reform; this category includes sizable
reductions in cash assistance for food stamps and AFDC, civil service
and railroad retirement, and medicare reimbursements to physicians and
hospitals. Management initiatives such as accelerated Outer Continental
Shelf oil leasing and federal pay restraint also result in large outlay
savings. Reductions in discretionary programs relating to transportation,
job training, education, and energy research are another source of outlay
savings.
The Administration's proposed budgets, which include the effects of
these initiatives, are shown in Table 4. Outlays in nominal terms would
grow at an average annual rate of over six percent between FY1982 and
FY1985; this is roughly half the average annual rate of growth in outlays
over the past decade. In addition, the composition of outlays is changed.
Between FY1982 and FY1985, for example, defense spending rises from 25
to 33 percent of the budget, while the share of all programs other than
defense, social security, medicaid, medicare, and interest falls. Budget
receipts are projected to grow at an average annual rate of 8.0 percent
between FY1982 and FY1985 in contrast to an annual rate of growth of
11.5 percent during the decade prior to 1982. This growth over the past
decade has been associated with rising social insurance contributions
and individual income taxes as a share of total receipts and with a
declining share accounted for by corporate income taxes. In contrast,
in the new proposals social insurance contributions and individual income
taxes together are projected to fall as a share of total receipts (as
personal income tax cuts outweigh the future increases in social insurance
contributions) and corporate income taxes are projected to rise between
FY1982 and FY1985 when corporate profits are projected to grow strongly.
The large absolute size of the Administration's prospective budget
deficits has lead to the proposal of numerous alternative deficit-reducing
measures by members of Congress. On the revenue side, there have been
recommendations to change provisions of existing tax legislation perceived
as "loop-holes" and to modify or roll back those of the recently-enacted
Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. On the outlay side, proposals gener-
ally have focused on reducing the Administration's proposed rate of

increase in defense spending and limiting cost-of-living adjustments for
entitlement programs. For example, Senators Domenici and Hollings both
have proposed to suspend, for 1982, the cost-of-living adjustment for
entitlement programs as well as to cap future inflation adjustments for
social security. Both have also proposed to keep the growth rate of
real defense outlays below that contained in the Administration's budget.
On the receipts side, Senator Domenici has proposed the closing of tax
loopholes, while Senator Hollings has focused on scaling back the tax
cuts passed last year. Senator Dole has also suggested modifications
to last year's tax bill as well as the tightening of several other
features of the existing tax code. Debate on these and other proposals
may crystalize in the next few months in light of April 15 deadline,
imposed by the Budget Act, for the First Concurrent Congressional Budget
Resolution and the expected May or June date for extension of the public
debt ceiling.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1 declined somewhat in February, following three months of excep-
tional strength; growth in M2 and M3 slowed appreciably. The aggregates
have firmed in early March, however, and depository institution reserve
positions have eased only moderately on balance since the last FOMC meet-
ing.
Over the intermeeting period, most short-term rates have fallen on
net by 3/4 to slightly more 1 percentage point and most long-term rates by
a little less. Even with these declines, short-term interest rates remain
2 to 3, and long-term rate 1/2 to 1-1/2, percentage points above the lows
reached last fall. Market participants evidently remain concerned about
the possibility that, especially as the economy begins to recover, money
demands will press hard against supplies restrained by Federal Reserve
policy. Meanwhile, concerns about the impact of prospective large federal
deficits are weighing heavily on investor sentiment in the intermediate-
and long-term debt markets.
Weak cash flows have sustained business financing requirements even
as capital outlays--especially on inventories--have slackened. In response
to continued high long-term rates, firms have concentrated their borrowing
in short-term markets, primarily from commercial banks, and have not begun
to repair their balance sheets as they typically do at this stage of an
economic cycle. Federal borrowing has remained heavy in the first quarter
but, owing to a smaller than projected deficit, has been less than antici-
pated earlier; state and local government borrowing has moderated a bit
from the fourth quarter of last year. Consumer credit remained sluggish
in January and probably again in February, but households may have stepped

up their borrowing slightly in the home mortgage market. Throughout the
private financial markets, signs of further erosion of credit quality and
financial strains continue to accumulate.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 contracted in February at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate, offsetting
a small part of the November-to-January surge. The decline last month was
concentrated in demand deposits; indeed, such accounts ran off at an extra-
ordinary 24 percent annual rate, more than erasing the gain of the preced-
ing few months. A temporary draining of demand deposits may have occurred
in connection with the large increase in the Treasury cash balance in late
January and early February. Seasonally adjusted inflows to other checkable
deposits slowed in February but showed no sign of reversing their recent
strength.1
Data available for M1 through mid-March point toward small--but posi-
tive--growth for the month.2 For the first quarter as a whole, M1 expansion
is likely to be on the order of 10 percent at an annual rate, well above
that suggested by historical relationships among narrow money, economic ac-
tivity, and interest rates. The reasons for the recent gyration in M1 are
not much clearer today than they were at the time of the last Greenbook; it
still seems likely that demands for highly liquid balances were boosted for
1. The surge in other checkable deposits between November and February was
not associated with an increase in the rate of new accounts opened; the num-
ber of accounts grew during that period at about the same moderate pace as
in the preceding three months, according to survey data for commercial banks.
2. Recent weakness in narrow money does not appear to be related to increased
use of deposit sweeps. A survey by Reserve Bank staff taken around mid-March
suggests that as yet only a handful of institutions offer deposit sweeping
arrangements, despite considerable publicity in trade publications. Many
institutions have been approached by vendors of sweeping services and report-
edly are considering the service very seriously.

a while by concerns that interest rates might retrace some of their earlier
decline, and perhaps by other economic uncertainties.
M2 growth also slowed considerably in February, but data for early
March suggest a substantial pickup. At 4 percent, the annual rate of M2
expansion last month was the weakest in more than a year. The slowdown
reflected primarily the drop in M1; however, growth in the nontransaction
component of M2 decelerated to a relatively sluggish 6-1/2 percent annual
rate.
Inflows to general purpose and broker/dealer money market mutual
funds decelerated further in February as average money fund yields re-
mained below market rates. Normal lags in recorded funds returns explain
this relationship in part; in addition, money funds have pursued a more
cautious investment strategy since late last year, increasing relative
holdings of Treasury securities at the expense primarily of higher-yield-
ing commercial paper. There are, furthermore, indications that tax-exempt
money funds (not included in the monetary aggregates) have been drawing
cash from the taxable money funds, owing to favorable after-tax yield com-
parisons.
The overnight RP component of M2 leveled off in February, perhaps
because of restrictions on available collateral associated with the run-
up in U.S. government deposits; overnight Eurodollar deposits contracted.
Growth of savings and small time deposits speeded up after January.
Savings deposits declined a bit in February after rising in the preced-
ing three months when other liquid balances also were strong, but the de-
cline in savings flows was more than offset by a jump in small time depos-
its. A good deal of the more rapid growth in small time deposits came from

III-5
a resurgence in MMC inflows in February, when their ceilings reached a
four-month peak. Inflows into ceiling-free IRA and Keogh accounts, which
had attracted a considerable volume of funds in January when IRA eligibil-
ity was broadened, also remained sizable in February. These accounts
totaled $5 billion at month-end, almost evenly divided between commercial
banks and thrift institutions.1
Overall, however, commercial banks continued to post stronger retail
deposit flows than thrift institutions. This trend emerged in 1979 after
the differential on MMC ceiling rates was effectively removed, but the gap
between bank and thrift retail deposit growth rates widened in 1981 when
the thrifts' earnings difficulties became widely publicized.2
M3 growth also slowed in February, reflecting weakness in M2 only
partially offset by an acceleration in its non-M2 component. While insti-
tution-only money fund balances ran off slightly faster in February than
in the previous month, term RPs resumed growth and the large time deposit
component of M3 strengthened considerably. As bank lending picked up and
core deposit growth slowed, banks issued substantially more large time
1. Commercial banks and MSBs on average have been pricing ceiling-free IRA/
Keogh accounts about in line with open market yields on U.S. government
obligations of comparable maturity. Very little information is available
on S&L pricing of these accounts.

average assets). One S&L was liquidated and 100 mergers were supervised by
the FSLIC; 23 of these mergers required financial assistance. Similarly,
FDIC-insured MSBs lost an estimated $1.4 billion after tax in 1981 (-.91
percent of average assets). Because of the somewhat stronger capital posi-
tion of MSBs, only 14 mutual savings banks were merged with stronger insti-
tutions in 1981.
In contrast, insured commercial banks in the aggregate posted continued
strong profitability during 1981, with after-tax earnings of .76 percent
of average assets. Like thrifts, small banks--with assets below $100 mil-
lion--experienced a rapid increase in interest expense associated with
their changing deposit mix; but in 1981 small banks acquired sufficient
money-market and variable-rate assets to maintain after-tax returns in
excess of one percent of average assets.

deposits; with Treasury balances having increased sharply, bank nondeposit
managed liabilities contracted.
Faster growth in loans fueled the acceleration in bank credit, which
expanded at an 11-1/2 percent annual rate after adjustment for the minor
estimated shifts of assets from domestic banking offices to International
Banking Facilities. Consumer loans contracted during the month, but real
estate and security loans expanded. Business lending activity continued
particularly brisk.
Business Finance
The total volume of funds raised from external sources by nonfinan-
cial businesses has continued to be sizable thus far this year, though it
appears to be somewhat smaller than in the second half of 1981. During
January and February the bulk of funds was raised in short-term markets--
primarily through borrowing at commercial banks and sales of commercial
paper--as domestic bond issuance was depressed by the high level of long-
term interest rates and equity issuance slowed in response to falling stock
prices.1 In early March, however, public bond offerings picked up as bond
rates fell, and borrowing from large banks appeared to have moderated. Al-
though the most common domestic public corporate offering continues to be
intermediate-maturity fixed-rate debt, several financial corporations re-
cently have sold variable-rate issues in the public market. Variable-rate
obligations had been out of favor among most potential public issuers since
1979, but they represented 10 percent of all direct placement commitments
made by life insurance companies during 1981.
1. U.S. corporations issued an average of about $1 billion per month in
Euro-market bonds this quarter, primarily in the form of zero-coupon obli-
gations marketed in January and early February. Fourth quarter Euro-market
borrowing averaged $.7 billion per month.

In late March, the Board's series on recently offered Aaa utility
bonds stood at 15.00 percent, down 78 basis points from early February
and less than 3 percentage points from its all-time high last September.
In view of the persistence of historically high rates, the extent of
debt funding in long-term markets has been light relative to comparable
stages of previous economic contractions. Businesses have preferred
short maturities or flexible terms in their loan agreements. At large
domestically chartered commercial banks, term loans have declined as a
share of total business loans. Recent survey results link this decline
to greater use of revolving credit arrangements, largely reflecting bank
accommodation of borrowers seeking assured financing terms while main-
taining the flexibility to shift to the long-term markets when cond-
tions improve.1
The major composite stock indexes have fallen 4 to 9 percent since
early February and recently reached their lowest levels since the spring
of 1980. The erosion in common stock values has been widespread, but the
fall in prices has been especially steep for oil-related companies. Owing
to the weakness of the equity market, stock issuance remained depressed
in February and so far in March. In the first quarter, gross new offer-
ings are expected to average little more than half the average monthly
pace of 1981. Net stock issuance was negative for the fourth quarter in
a row as merger-related retirements continued to be large.
Evidence of financial stress in the corporate sector continues to
accumulate. Preliminary data for early 1982 suggest that business failures

adjusted for business population may well exceed the postwar peak reached
in 1961. The number of downgradings of corporate bonds has increased and
in recent weeks some major U.S. corporations have been affected.1 There
also have been more downgradings of commercial paper issuers, some of whom
recently have utilized their commercial bank lines of credit.2 Many cor-
porations have cut dividend rates in order to conserve cash resources.
Yield spreads between higher- and lower-rated corporate bonds, which have
been above normal for some time, have not widened recently; however, that
stability may simply reflect the promptness of changes by the rating agen-
cies.
Commercial banks report a further weakening in the financial condi-
tion of their business loan customers. More than two-thirds of large banks
surveyed in February indicated a deterioration since November in the finan-
cial condition of businesses to which they had loans outstanding. National
banks--particularly those on the west coast and in the Chicago district--
showed an increase in the fraction of their domestic-office business loans
"past due" in their year-end reports of condition.

expected to be about $26 billion. This is somewhat below the Treasury's

earlier estimate because tax receipts have been higher than expected and
expenditures have slowed temporarily. By the end of the month, the Trea-
sury will have borrowed about $31 billion in the market in order to finance
its first-quarter deficit, $10 billion less than had been announced late
in January. As of the end of February, the Treasury had already borrowed
nearly $22 billion--$9 billion in bills and $12.5 billion in coupon issues.
In March the Treasury is expected to borrow another $2 billion in bills and
almost $8 billion in coupons.
Additional bond financing may not be possible soon, since the Trea-
sury has exhausted its exemption from the 4-1/4 percent ceiling on coupon
issues over 10 years and Congress is not expected to authorize another
exemption until later in the spring. As a result, the Treasury increased
the amount of new cash raised at its mid-March auctions of 2- and 4-year
notes.
Federally sponsored credit agencies are expected to borrow only about
$2 billion in the first quarter as borrowing by the major agencies continues
to be weak. FNMA's borrowing dropped to about $700 million. The Federal
Farm Credit Banks are expected to borrow only about $500 million in the
first quarter, as farmers have turned to Commodity Credit Corporation loans
carrying more favorable interest-rate terms (in addition to the price-sup-
port feature) than loans from Farm Credit Banks. Although the Federal Home
Loan Banks raised less than $300 million in the first quarter, this borrow-
ing occurred in a period in which this agency usually pays down its out-
standing debt. Finally, the Student Loan Marketing Administration, which
no longer will borrow from the Federal Financing Bank, is estimated to have
borrowed $450 million in the first quarter.

III-13
State and Local Sector. Gross issuance of long-term municipal se-
curities in March is estimated at $3-3/4 billion (s.a.), which is below
the volume sold in January and February. Revenue securities continued
to account for about 70 percent of this total; most of the proceeds were
used by utilities and by hospitals. In the short-term sector, the net
volume to date this year is about equal to the brisk pace in 1981, but
the gross volume has increased largely because maturities on H.U.D. pro-
ject notes have been shortened.

tutional investors, including commercial banks and the rapidly expanding
tax-exempt money funds.
Most measures of quality spreads in the tax-exempt market place risk
premiums between prime- and medium-grade general obligations at around 100
basis points--about the same as the relatively wide monthly average of the
second half of 1981 but well below the records set in 1976. Depressed
economic activity and decreased revenues have prompted downgradings on gen-
eral obligations of two states and one major city thus far in 1982. Since
the beginning of 1980 there have been 17 such downgradings, representing a
significant deterioration in the standing of major issuers of general obli-
gation debt.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage lending activity remains weak but probably has increased
from the depressed fourth quarter pace. Mortgage holdings of S&Ls increased
slightly in January after three months of attrition, and those of commercial
banks increased faster in January and February than in the fall.
Creative financing techniques--not fully captured in the reported
data--have become more commonplace in recent months. On the basis of a
January survey of its members, the National Association of Realtors (NAR)
estimates that creative financing techniques were used in about 70 percent
of existing-home sales, up from 60 percent in October and 50 percent last
April. Assumptions of seasoned first mortgages combined with seller-financed
second mortgages continued to be the most frequently used creative tech-
nique in existing-home sales.1
1. The NAR for the first time asked its members to describe the terms on
second mortgages in their most recent transactions involving such financ-
ing. For second mortgages provided by sellers, NAR members (contd.)

III-16
Activity in secondary markets for mortgage loans has strengthened
a bit since the last FOMC meeting, and may account for reports by mort-
gage bankers that the supply of funds for both conventional and FHA/VA
mortgage lending appeared to be loosening in late February and early
March. FHLMC auction-based commitment activity increased in late Febru-
ary and early March, with the agency continuing to accept all of the
limited volume of offerings of conventional mortgages. However, activi-
ty slackened again in mid-March. Issuance of FHLMC-guaranteed mortgage
passthrough securities stepped up in January to its fastest monthly pace
ever; issuance of GNMA-guaranteed passthroughs grew slightly in February.
A considerable portion of FHLMC activity apparently consisted of recent-
ly introduced swaps of agency securities for low-rate mortgages.1 These
swaps reduce the level of mortgage holdings reported by the participat-
ing lenders and thus cause an understatement of the net volume of lend-
ing actually accomplished by these institutions.
Primary market mortgage interest rates declined in late February
through mid-March. The average contract interest rate on new commit-
ments for fixed-rate, level-payment conventional home loans at a sample
(contd.) reported a median interest rate of 11-3/4 percent--more than 5
percentage points below prevailing market commitment rates--a median term
of five years, an average loan-to-value ratio of 21 percent, and balloon
payments at maturity in more than three-fourths of the mortgages. Just
7 percent of home sellers planned to sell the second mortgages, according
to NAR respondents.
1. Since late last year, S&Ls and certain other mortgage investors have
swapped a large volume of low-rate conventional home mortgage loans for
somewhat lower-yielding securities backed up by the mortgages and under-
written by FHLMC or FNMA. These securities can be used by S&Ls as col-
lateral for borrowing via repurchase agreements. The amount of swaps
arranged under these new programs has thus far exceeded $15 billion--
more than $10 billion by FHLMC and about $5 billion by FNMA. Additional
swap volume seems likely, especially as FHLMC liberalized operating pro-
cedures, effective March 1, for its so-called "guarantor program."

III-17
of S&Ls was 17.12 percent around mid-March, 47 basis points lower than
at the last FOMC meeting. As the decline in market rates trimmed dis-
counts on FHA/VA home mortgages, the ceiling rate on such fixed-rate
loans was reduced a full percentage point to 15-1/2 percent, effective
March 2.
In early February, as in January, almost 40 percent of the limited
number of conventional home mortgages closed by major institutional
lenders bore adjustable rate features. For this yield flexibility, lend-
ers reportedly were willing to forgo initially around 50 basis points re-
lative to yields on fixed-rate level-payment loans.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit expanded in January at a 1-1/2 percent
seasonally adjusted annual rate following a slight contraction in Decem-
ber. The entire gain was in personal cash loans and sales finance con-
tracts; automobile, revolving, and mobile home credit all declined. Cred-
it held by finance companies declined for the second consecutive month,
while loans held by credit unions grew sharply, buoyed by their sizable
deposit inflows. Some contraction in consumer credit may have occurred
in February, judging from weakness already estimated for retailer-held
credit and for large commercial banks.
The slowdown in consumer credit growth since September is consis-
tent with the pattern typical during a recession. Credit growth usually
tapers off prior to cyclical peaks in economic activity, and becomes
negative a few months into a recession (see chart on page 111-20). Unlike
prior cyclical peaks, however, the ratio of debt repayments to disposable
income was very low--rather than near a peak--when the current contraction

began, because consumer credit growth had been sluggish for the preceding
year.
With the atypical behavior of the ratio of debt repayments to dis-
posable income has come a smaller-than-normal increase in consumer loan
delinquency rates for this stage of a business cycle. Delinquencies on
auto loans at major finance companies remained at an all-time low in the
fourth quarter. Delinquency rates on closed-end consumer loans at com-
mercial banks rose in the fourth quarter of 1981, but remained near the
lower readings of the past eight years. However, many large banks re-
sponding to the February Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported that
mortgage and consumer loan delinquency rates were higher than in November,
and some reported having taken actions to repossess collateral and to re-
structure terms of original loan agreements. The mortgage delinquency
rate at S&Ls set a record high in January.

SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY
Of the 60 large commercial banks responding to the February 15,
1982 Survey of Senior Loan Officer Opinion on Bank Lending Practices, two-
thirds expressed the view that business loan demand during the next three
months would not ease. These expectations came at a time when business
loans at all large commercial banks were growing at more than a 20 per-
cent annual rate for the third consecutive month. In the survey taken
last November, when large bank loan growth had been weak, only about half
of the participating banks expected business loan demand at their banks
to at least maintain its then-current strength.
Most respondents indicated that they were maintaining the standards
they had established last November for business borrowers to qualify for
the prime rate or for a given spread above prime. At that time, there
was some indication of an easing in standards to qualify for the prime.
At the time of the February survey, the spread of the prime rate over the
commercial paper rate was as low as it had been in many months.
Compensating balance or fee requirements for commercial and indus-
trial loans were eased by about the same fraction of respondents--one-
fourth--as in November. Almost two-thirds had not altered their standards
over the three months ended February. Nearly all respondents were main-
taining standards that prevailed in the three months prior to the Febru-
ary survey for lending to new and nonlocal commercial and industrial
firms.
As in the November survey, more than 70 percent of respondents indi-
cated no change in their willingness to make installment loans to indivi-
duals. In contrast to the previous survey, however, the number reporting
less willingness in February exceeded that reporting greater willingness.
Of the two large banks indicating greater willingness to make consumer in-
stallment loans, one had recently initiated variable interest rate consu-
mer loans.
The three supplemental questions retained from the previous two sur-
veys indicate further deterioration by February in the credit quality of
outstanding loans. More than two-thirds of the respondents reported a
weakening in the financial condition of businesses to which they had
loans outstanding, up somewhat from November. Increases in mortgage and
consumer installment loan delinquency rates were reported by two-fifths
of the respondents, double the proportion in the November survey.
Surveyed banks took a variety of measures in response to deteriora-
tion in the quality of their business, mortgage, and consumer installment
loan portfolios. For the majority of cases involving business borrowers,
payments were restructured either alone or in combination with increases
in collateral, as in November. In the case of consumer installment loans,

about the same number of banks as in November indicated that they were
repossessing collateral, restructuring payments, or both. In November,
no banks reported repossession of real estate as the sole response to
mortgage loan delinquencies, but in February a few of those with increas-
ed delinquency rates indicated having done so. Another one-third of the
respondents with increased mortgage delinquencies in February were repos-
sessing real estate and restructuring payments.
There was little change from November in the number of respondents
observing a decline in the financial condition of new business loan ap-
plicants. At both times, about one-third of the banks--and over two-
fifths of the large banks--reported observing a deterioration.
Autos and auto dealers were the most frequently cited sector where
financial deterioration had been perceived, in the case of both existing
borrowers and new applicants. The housing, construction and real estate
sector was mentioned nearly as often, and these two sectors combined
accounted for half of the industries in which credit weakening had been
detected. There seemed to be little difference in experience among lo-
cal, regional, or national firms overall, although certain of the most
frequently named industries undergoing strains are local by nature.
Earlier this year, term business loans at all large banks as a
group fell in relation to total business loans. However, only two-fifths
of the surveyed banks indicated, in answer to a supplemental question,
that they had experienced a similar maturity shift. Those banks that had
seen a relative increase in shorter maturities attributed greater use of
revolving credit arrangements as the predominant source of increase in
short-term business loans. Most of the banks reporting increased use of
revolving credit loans indicated that they were accommodating borrowers
who were seeking assured financing terms that offered them the flexibili-
ty to shift to the long-term bond market if conditions there improved.
Some banks indicated that they viewed revolving credit loans as tanta-
mount to variable rate term loans--even though the borrower had great
flexibility to vary the actual outstanding balance--and some further indi-
cated that the revolving credit agreements carried options available to
the borrowers to convert to term loans after a specified period. A few
banks reported actively inducing enlarged use of revolving credit arrange-
ments by offering especially favorable terms; they did this either as a
way to manage interest sensitivity for assets relative to that for liabil-
ities or as a way to minimize fixed-rate term loans.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The dollar's foreign-exchange value has been under considerable
upward pressure for most of the period since the last FOMC meeting.
On a weighted-average basis it has risen three percent, as indicated
in the chart on the next page.
Movements in the dollar's value over the last two months have
been influenced particularly by developments affecting current and
prospective interest rates on assets denominated in dollars and other
major foreign currencies. Dollar yields, which had come to exceed
a weighted-average of comparable foreign interest rates by two per-
centage points at the time of the last FOMC meeting, are now nearly
three percentage points higher than their counterparts, having risen
in the interim to a differential of close to 4-1/2 points. Movements
in U.S. rates accounted for most of the changes in such differentials;
foreign interest rates have continued fairly steadily along the declining
path they have been on since mid-December.
On average, short-term interest rates abroad have fallen about
75 basis points since early February. Rates in the Netherlands and
Switzerland have been lowered or allowed to fall by two and a half
percent or more, and U.K., Belgian, Swedish, and Italian rates have
come down by about one percentage point. German rates have also been
allowed to ease, and the Bundesbank Council last week announced another
half-percent reduction in its special Lombard rate. The German move
was co-ordinated with actions by Swiss and Dutch authorities to lower
their official rates by the same amount. Authorities in France have

have recently moved to reverse the downward trend in interest rates;
only there and in Canada, among major industrial countries, have rates
moved upward on balance over the last two months.
While interest rates still have center stage in explanations of
recent exchange-rate movements, a number of other developments have
tended to depress the value of one or another foreign currency and have
thereby helped account for some of the apparent upward pressure on the
dollar's value. Announcements in late February of significant reduc-
tions in oil prices by Iran and Mexico brought downward pressure
to bear on sterling and to a lesser extent the Canadian dollar. Around
the same time and again this week, the mark weakened as centrifugal
forces operating on the political coalition governing Germany inten-
sified. Unfavorable by-election outcomes and accusations of fund-
raising improprieties by two Cabinet ministers have raised the level
of political stress in Germany over recent months. Finally, the yen
has been under fairly steady downward pressure throughout the period,
though the cause is not clear. One explanation offered is that threats
against Japanese trade from Europe and the United States might cut
into the trade surplus, and domestic and foreign pressures might induce
the Japanese government to stimulate economic activity.
On February 21 a realignment of currency values in the European
Monetary System was announced. The central rates of the Belgian and
Luxembourg francs were lowered by 8-1/2 percent and the Danish crown's
central rate was moved down by 3 percent. Unlike most other EMS
realignments, these changes meant that prevailing market exchange
rates for the Belgian and Luxembourg currencies were above the range

IV-4
of permissible deviations from the new central rate,
Including additional downward
movement since the realignment, the Belgian franc is now 11 percent
lower in dollar terms than at the time of the last FOMC meeting.
In mid-February, the Mexican government announced temporary with-
drawal of support for the peso. The Mexican currency's dollar value
immediately fell about 30 percent and has since declined further to
a level about 40 percent below its pre-devaluation level. The change
in the peso's value offsets most of the rise in Mexican prices relative
to those in the United States since the last devaluation in 1976.

IV-5
.The apparent diver-
gence between current and prospective French and German economic
policies has led to widespread expectations that another adjustment
in EMS currency relationships will be required.
The price of gold has fallen more than 12 percent since the
last FOMC meeting. The likelihood that the Soviet Union is selling
and will need to sell large quantities of gold over the foreseeable
future has increased because of potential retrenchments in the will-
ingness of official and private Western lenders to supply credit on
a large scale. Gold sales by Iran have also been foreseen as needed
to finance war efforts, and the extent of other Middle Eastern demand
for gold may have been decreased by recent oil-price developments.

Foreign lending by U.S. banks. Claims on foreigners held by domes-
tic offices and foreign branches of U.S.-chartered banks rose $28 billion
in the second half of 1981, slightly less than in the first half of the
year. (See accompanying table.) Claims on the other G-10 countries and
Switzerland continued to slow down, as did claims on offshore banking
centers, while net lending to the smaller industrial countries and to the
non-OPEC developing countries continued to intensify.
The increase in total foreign claims in the second half of 1981 was
at an annual rate of about 15 percent, and thus was again within the
rather narrow range of 14-17 percent annual rate of increase shown in all
four half-yearly periods in 1980-81. However, while the rate of overall
net lending has been quite steady for two years, the trends in lending to
various groups of borrowers have diverged. Increases in claims on the
other G-10 countries and Switzerland, the largest borrowing groups, have
become progressively smaller, the increase in claims on this group account-
ing for only one-sixth of the increase in total foreign claims in the
second half of 1981. This slowing has probably reflected the sluggishness
of economic activity in the major industrial countries abroad and the
consequent weakening of credit demands there relative to other areas of
the world. In contrast, the rate of increase in claims on the smaller
industrial countries has accelerated in the past two years, reaching
$3.7 billion in the second half of 1981, although outstandings remain
relatively small. Major factors in this development have been the growing
role of Australia as a borrower in the Eurocurrency markets, the resump-
tion of U.S. bank lending to South Africa after several years of decline, and
the increasing share of U.S. banks in total foreign bank lending to Spain
as well as Australia.

Claims on the non-OPEC developing countries rose $11.4 billion in
the final six months of 1981, the sixth consecutive half-yearly period in
which net lending substantially exceeded the year-earlier level. The
increases in claims on Mexico, Brazil, and Korea were markedly larger than
a year earlier, and for 1981 as a whole the increases in claims on those
countries and Chile were 35 to 180 percent greater than in 1980. Much
higher spreads were an incentive to banks to increase their lending to
Brazil, despite already high exposure. Argentina, whose credit standing
dropped in 1981 and which experienced a rise in spreads late in the year,
was the only major borrower in this group to which net lending was smaller
in 1981 than in 1980.
Claims on OPEC countries rose $1.7 billion in 1981 compared with a
slight absolute decline in 1980. Net lending to Indonesia and Middle
East oil-exporting countries became positive again in 1981, after being
negative in 1980 when repayments exceeded new drawings. Claims on Vene-
zuela rose further in 1981 and reached $9.6 billion by year-end, the third
largest amount of U.S. bank claims on any OPEC or non-OPEC developing
country (after Mexico and Brazil). U.S. banks' claims on Eastern Europe
rose $0.5 billion in 1981, of which $0.3 billion was in the first quarter
of the year. After the first quarter, net new lending to Eastern Europe
was confined largely to Hungary and the Soviet Union.

U.S. International Transactions
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in January returned to the very
large deficit rate recorded in October and November of last year. In
six of the past seven months there have been substantial swings in the
trade balance.
Exports in January were slightly less than the fourth-quarter rate.
The value of agricultural exports continued at about the same low rate
as was recorded during the second half of last year. While the volume
of wheat and soybeans turned up in January after months of declines (and
prices of both rose somewhat as well), these increases were offset by
declines in a broad range of commodities, particularly feedgrains (corn).

The volume of corn exports, which rose in the fourth quarter of 1981,
dropped back in January to the low third-quarter rate; corn export prices
continued to fall.
Nonagricultural exports in January also declined slightly in value
from the fourth-quarter rate. The level of exports was held up by sharp
increases in civilian aircraft deliveries and in petroleum exports.
Aircraft exports fluctuate widely from month to month and January exports
were unusually strong on a seasonally adjusted basis. The sharp rise in
petroleum exports in January continued the increase begun last fall as a
result of the lifting (October 2, 1981) of restrictions on product exports.
The additional exports consisted largely on high-sulphur residual fuel
oil, of which surplus quantities had been accumulating on the West and
Gulf coasts. Restrictions on exports of crude petroleum remain in effect.
Excluding aircraft and petroleum, the value of nonagricultural exports
declined in January as it did in almost every month since last summer.
These declines occurred in a broad range of commodity categories,
The sharp rise in imports in January from the fourth-quarter rate
was entirely the result of a rise in oil imports to 6.7 million barrels
per day (seasonally adjusted), well above the low December rate and the
average for the fourth quarter. However, monthly oil import figures
tend to swing sharply and it is not expected that imports will remain at

changed from the average price recorded during the fourth quarter.
Several oil producers have lowered oil prices in recent weeks.
The United Kingdom and Norway cut their prices by $5.50 per barrel, and
Mexico, Venezuela and Iran have also made price cuts. Spot prices have
remained $5 per barrel below the official prices of most OPEC producers.
Last weekend OPEC formalized a production allocation program to try to
reverse the decline of spot market prices and preserve an effective price
of $34 per barrel of Saudi marker crude.
The value of nonoil imports in January was at about the same rate
as in the fourth quarter of 1981; increases in steel and smaller rises
in consumer goods and foreign passenger cars and trucks were offset by
declines in imports of food (largely sugar and coffee) and in other
industrial supplies.
U.S. International Capital Transactions. Bank-reported private
capital transactions in December resulted in a large net outflow of $13
billion, bringing the cumulative net outflow for 1981 to $33 billion
excluding custody accounts -- $3 billion more than in 1980. See line 1
in the table on the next page. The December outflow is partially accounted
for by the borrowings of several Latin American and Asian countries to
bolster their end-of-year reserve positions. Reserve holdings in the
United States of these countries rose $3.5 billion in December, compared
with a cumulative increase of $0.7 billion for the first 11 months of
the year.

Most of the large December bank-reported outflow can not be linked
at this time to any specific factors. Two possible explanations were
examined but neither appears to account for the outflow. The intro-
duction in December of IBFs should have had no net effect on bank-
reported U.S. international capital transactions. A staff review of
Federal Reserve and Treasury reports focusing on IBF-related items found
no evidence of misreporting. The introduction of IBFs, therefore, is
not the source of the large December net bank-reported capital outflow.
The second possible explanation was the timing of acquisition-related
drawings by Marathon, Mobil and U.S. Steel on their Eurocredit loan
facilities, but there were no drawings on these loans in December.
A separate data source on banks' international position shows that
during January and February U.S. banks brought in about $5 billion from
their foreign offices (see line 1.a in the table on the next page which
shows positions vis-a-vis own foreign offices). Loans to U.S. nonbank
residents from the foreign branches of U.S. banks, shown in line 2 of
the table, changed little from November through February and then rose
somewhat in March. This rise in offshore borrowings reflects not only
current interest rate differentials but also may imply a somewhat stronger
anticipation of higher short-term rates in the near term than was previously
anticipated. That is, by borrowing on LIBOR terms (a fixed rate) rather
than at the prime rate (a daily floating rate) the borrower is protected
against rising interest rates in the near term.
Eurobond offerings of U.S. corporations rose to $3 billion in
the first quarter of 1982, twice the quarterly average for 1981. More
than half the value of such offerings were about 24 zero-coupon Eurobonds

of U.S. corporate issuers, which were reportedly particularly attractive
to Japanese investors, No zero-coupon Eurobonds have been offered since
authorities in Japan acted to discourage acquisition by Japanese of zero-
coupon Eurobonds during the past several weeks. Overall Eurobond
offerings, including a $400 million issue by AT&T, accounted for about
one third the total of U.S. corporate bond offerings in the first quarter
of 1982, This was AT&T's first public issue in the Eurobond market --
AT&T has previously borrowed privately from OPEC investors.

market-mutual funds, which held one fifth of these Eurodollars, increased
their holdings by more than $1.5 billion over the January-February period.
This raised the share of Eurodollars in their portfolios to more than 12
percent, as compared with 11.5 percent at the end of 1981 and 9.5 percent
at the end of 1980.
Foreign official holdings of assets in the United States fell by
$1.7 billion in January,
.Data for changes in February holdings of
foreign official institutions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show
a $1.6 billion decrease in the holdings of G-10 countries and a $2.7
billion increase in holdings by OPEC countries.
U.S. Current Account in 1981. For 1981 the US. current account
surplus was $6.6 billion, somewhat larger than in the preceding two years.
Higher net interest receipts from portfolio investments than in 1980 more
than offset a larger U.S. trade deficit and reduced net income from direct
investments abroad.
During 1981 the current account balance swung from surpluses in
the first three quarters to a small deficit in the fourth quarter. This
elimination of the current account surplus largely resulted from the
rising U.S. merchandise trade deficit. Exports declined through most of
the year in response to sluggish economic growth abroad and the effect of
the appreciation of the dollar between 1980 and 1981 that reduced price

IV -16
competitiveness of U.S. goods on world markets. In addition, the value
of agricultural exports declined, primarily as world market prices fell.
Imports, which rose steadily during the first half of the year and
remained at fairly high levels through the end of the year, were sustained
by strong domestic demand at the beginning of the year and the appreciation
of the dollar. Total imports remained strong in the second half of the
year even though oil imports fell (both price and volume).

Other (non-trade) current account transactions were dominated by
investment income flows. Total net investment income receipts were 12
percent higher in 1981 than the year before, and rose slightly throughout
the year. U.S. portfolio investment income, net, rose fairly sharply,
particularly in the second half of the year as a result of rising net
U.S. claims on foreigners and the high level of interest rates. Income
from U.S. direct investment abroad declined steadily during the year as

foreign ecnomies weakened, which depressed the earnings of manufacturing
and other businesses, and as overseas earnings.of U.S. oil companies fell
as a result of declining demand for petroleum products while the cost of
crude oil remained high.
Other Capital Flows in 1981. There was a striking reduction in
1981 in net outflows for U.S. direct investments abroad. U.S. direct
investments abroad were unusually small, reflecting in part borrowing
in the Eurobond market by U.S. parent companies via offshore finance
affiliates. (Borrowings by offshore financial subsidiaries rose sharply
to about $3 billion in the first quarter of this year.) Foreign direct
investments in the United States were very large in 1981, particularly
in the fourth quarter. Two examples of sizable foreign acquisitions
of U.S. companies were Santa Fe Industries by Kuwaiti interests and
Texas Gulf by Elf Aquitaine. See line 7 in Summary table above.

IV -18
Foreign Economic Developments. Real GNP fell slightly in the
fourth quarter of 1981 in the six major foreign countries. Following
slow growth in 1980, growth in 1981 (fourth quarter over fourth quarter)
was about 1/2 percent. Fourth-quarter unemployment in each of the
six countries was higher than in the previous quarter, and has continued
to increase this year in Germany, and France.
Inflation (CPI) in the fourth quarter of 1981 was lower abroad
than in the previous three quarters, except in Japan and Italy. A
comparison of inflation in the most recent two months with that in
the previous two months indicate further improvement, with slight
setbacks in Germany and France.
The estimated current-account deficit in the foreign G-10
countries plus Switzerland in 1981 declined by about $30 billion to
about $20 billion. Strong improvements occurred in Japan, Germany,
and the United Kingdom, while significiant deterioration occurred
in the Canadian balance.
Moderate fiscal stimulation is planned in Germany, Japan and
the United Kingdom. France has indicated that fiscal policy may
become tighter than expected previously. Central banks generally
have been lowering official interest rates since the first of the
year. On March 3, the Belgian National Bank announced a one point
decrease in its official rate to 13 percent. On March 18, Germany,
Switzerland, and the Netherlands, in a coordinated move, lowered
rates by 1/2 percent. Exchange market pressures have forced the
Bank of France to reverse the trend for the quarter and to raise
its rate.

IV -19
The EMS has been strained in the last several months; one
realignment was required and another is probable. The Mexican
authorities withdrew support from the peso on February 17, and it
depreciated by about 40 percent over the next few days.
Individual Country Notes. Newly released data on fourth-quarter
real growth in Japan show that GNP fell by almost 4 percent (s.a.a.r.)
in the quarter. This decline, which was the first such fall in almost seven
years, followed the previous quarter's 2.8 percent growth, and stemmed
largely from a rapid weakening of the external sector. Growth in
domestic demand improved slightly but failed to offset fully a more
than 16 percent (s.a.a.r.) decline in real exports. Private consumption
advanced in the fourth quarter by about 2 percent (a.r.).
Recent price developments have been generally favorable. Consumer
prices rose only marginally in February -the fifth consecutive month
in which the month-to-month change was below 2-1/2 percent at an annual
rate. Wholesale prices recorded an abrupt 6 percent (a.r.) gain in
February, primarily because of the weakening of the yen last month.
However, the February WPI was still less than 3 percent above its
year-previous level.
The Japanese current-account position improved strongly in
January to a surplus of over $1 billion (s.a.) from December's roughly
balanced position, largely on the strength of a 13 percent increase in
exports. Also in January, outward portfolio investment by Japanese
residents moderated only slightly from December's level and was still
about $1-1/2 billion. Reacting to continued outflows in February -- in
particular, to heavy Japanese purchases of zero-coupon bonds issued by

U.S. corporations in the Euro-bond market -- in early March, the
authorities banned the sales of these bonds by Japanese securities
houses.
On March 9, the Japanese Diet approved the FY1982 budget, which
calls for a nominal expenditure increase of only 6.2 percent, one of
the smallest rates of increase in many years. However, the Japanese
plan to take several measures, including advancing government expenditure
to stimulate the domestic economy.
German real GNP declined by 0.5 percent last year, and by 0.8 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter. From the data available so far this
year, there are no indications of strong revival. Industrial production
in January, while up by 2 percent from December, was not higher than
its fourth-quarter average of last year. The January volume of orders
was unchanged from its December level and also only barely higher than
the fourth-quarter average of last year. The rate of unemployment
continued to climb through February, when it reached 6.8 percent (s.a.),
and is expected to rise further. The German Federal Labor Office
estimates that real GNP would have to grow by 3 percent (twice the
officially forecast rate) in order to keep the rate of unemployment
from rising further. The recently announced job creation program of
DM 12.5 billion (less than 1 percent of 1981 GNP) over the next three
years, financed by tax increases and off-budget borrowing, is not
expected to have a major impact on employment.
Inflation in the first two months of 1982, due in part to
significant seasonal factors, was about 6-1/2 percent (a.r.) compared
with 6 percent for all of 1981 and 4.8 percent for the fourth quarter.

IV -24
On March 8, the first major wage settlement of this year's round was
concluded with a 4.2 percent wage increase for metal workers, down from
4.9 percent in 1981. This settlement, which suggests a reduction in
real wages of about 1 percent, is expected to set the pace for the
remaining negotiations.
The German current account deficit declined from $16.5 billion
in 1980 to $7.7 billion in 1981. In the fourth quarter of last year,
the current account was in surplus. In January, a deficit of $1.3
billion (n.s.a.) was recorded, some of which -- according to the
Bundesbank -- was due to seasonal and technical factors. The February
deficit was only $0.2 billion.
In the United Kingdom, real GNP increased 1-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.)
in the fourth quarter of 1981. The average level of industrial production
(s.a.) also increased in the final quarter of last year, but the declines
in industrial production recorded in November, December, and January
indicate the weakness of the recovery in U.K. economic activity.
Consumer prices in February were unchanged from their January level.
During the six months to February 1982, consumer prices rose some
8 percent (a.r.); during the same period, wholesale-price inflation was
9-1/2 percent.
On March 9, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Geoffrey Howe presented
the Thatcher government's budget for the fiscal year beginning in April.
In his budget speech, Chancellor Howe announced new monetary growth
targets as well as several fiscal measures. The tax changes announced
include a reduction in payroll taxes paid by employers, increases in
personal income tax allowances and brackets, and increases in various

IV -26
months (a.r.), Hourly wages in France rose by 15-1/2 percent from
October to October, giving a worker a gain in purchasing power of about
1 percent. However, minimum wage earners' purchasing power increased by
over 4 percent, indicating a relative improvement in the position of
the lowest paid. When the government announced its objective of increasing
the real wage of the poorest, there was considerable doubt about the
likelihood of being able to constrain the increase in the minimum wage
from spreading. Apparently some success has been achieved.
Since the last Greenbook, nationalization has finally been approved
and new heads appointed for the nationalized industries (full transfer
of control occurs on July 1, 1982).
President Mitterand has asked the government to hold the budget
deficitin the 1983 budget below 3 percent of GDP; nearly the same ratio
is. expected for this year. The government will be required to increase
its spending in 1983 by $10-15 billion less than some earlier expectations.
In the fourth quarter of 1981, Italian IP rose by over 5 percent
to a level about .1 percent below that of the same quarter of the
previous year. Business surveys suggest an upturn in the first part
of this year as orders are up, especially for investment and intermediate
goods. Consumer prices during the 3 months ending in February rose at
an annual rate of about 17 percent, down slightly in comparison with
the previous three-month period. Wholesale price inflation has remained
high, with an increase in the 12 months ending in December of over
18 percent.
The trade account improved markedly in the final quarter of last
year, with deficit of $2-1/4 billion, compared with a $5-1/2 billion

IV -27
deficit in the final quarter of 1980. Strong export growth and weak
domestic economic activity accounted for this improvement.
The government's budget proposals, which call for a real reduction
in current government expenditure, remain stalled in Parliament. The
shakiness of the present coalition government has also hindered its
effort to alter the wage indexation system. This system accounted for
much of the 23 percent rise in industrial wages in 1981.
In Canada, real GNP declined 2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth
quarter of 1981 after having declined 3.4 percent in the third quarter.
This yields an increase of 1 percent in real GNP from 1980-Q4 to 1981--Q4.
The pace of inventory accumulation and residential investment slowed
considerably in the fourth quarter. At the present, there are no clear
signs that the Canadian economy is near the bottom of the recession.
There is some evidence, however, that prices have begun to moderate
somewhat. Inflation as measured by the CPI has eased during the
three-month period ending in January 1982, as the increase in the CPI
slowed to 2.3 percent from 2.7 percent the previous three months.
The current-accourt deficit fell to $0.5 billion in the fourth
quarter from $2.1 billion in the third quarter of last year. For 1981
as a whole the deficit was almost $5.6 billion compared with about
$1.6 billion in 1980.
In Belgium the continued weak pace of economic activity was
reflected in a further rise of the unemployment rate. In December the
rate reached 15.4 percent (n.s.a.) of the insured labor force, compared
with 13.7 percent one year earlier. Although inflation has not
accelerated further, it remains high. In January and February the

IV -28
consumer price index averaged 8 percent above the year earlier level,
The trade deficit similarly has not worsened recently, but remains
high. Through November, the trade deficit totaled $6.3 billion. In
response to these current macroeconomic problems, the government has
recently adopted a major policy program. In early February, Parliament
approved a measure whereby the government was authorized to rule by
decree for one year on certain economic matters. On February 22 the
Belgian franc was devalued by 8.5 percent within the EMS. At the same
time the government announced a wage and price freeze. Wages are
frozen until the end of May for all but the lowest paid workers. From
June until the end of 1982, cost-of-living adjustments will take the
form of a flat-rate increase which will only partly cover inflation.
Prices are frozen until the end of March, after which time increases
will be allowed only if necessary (primarily to meet increased costs
of imported inputs). In addition, tax changes were announced that
encourage investment in Belgian equities.
On February 17, the Bank of Mexico announced that it was
temporarily withdrawing from the foreign exchange market in order to
let the quotation of the. peso vis-a-vis other currencies find a level
correspinding to current economic conditions. In the next few days,
the peso's value in dollar terms fell about 40 percent (from about
3.74 cents to about 2.2Q cents) and since then has remained near this
rate. Since the peso was last devalued, by 45 percent in 1976, Mexico
has followed generally expansionary policies. As a result, economic
growth was more than 8 percent in each of the past four years, and
employment grew by more than 3 million, but inflation averaged over

IV -29
20 percent annually in 1977-80, and 28 percent in 1981. This policy
resulted in a widening of the current-account deficit from about
$2 billion in 1977 to about $12 billion last year, even though crude oil
exports increased from less than $1 billion in 1977 to about $14 billion.
Fears of a possible large peso devaluation emerged last year as
public awareness of the deterioration in the current-account position
increased. Capital flight developed in early summer when the government
attempted to resist the downward trend in world oil prices and, for two
months, sold only obout half as much oil as it had been selling. While
capital flight abated somewhat after Mexican oil prices were brought
back into line with world quotations in August, it picked up momentum
once again late last eyar after the 1982 budget was announced, making
it clear that the expansionary policies would be continued. The potential
current-account deficit for 1982 widely forecast before the devaluation
greatly exceeded the amount of external finance thought likely to be
available from foreign and international lenders, pointing to the
inevitability of a crisis. When the outflow intensified early in February,
and reserves ran down rapidly, the authorities concluded that it would
be too costly, if not impossible, to put off action.
