The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Industrial production and employment declined further in April,
indicating continued weakness in economic activity. To a large extent
this reflects a sharp decline in inventory investment. Additionally,
spending for business fixed investment has weakened, and indicators of
future business outlays point to further reductions. However, consumer
demand has held up reasonably well, and inflation has continued to
moderate. The reduction of the inventory overhang, which has proceeded
at a rapid rate, will provide a base for a rebound in activity.
Employment and Industrial Production
Labor demand contracted again in April, and the overall unemploy-
ment rate reached a post-World War II high of 9.4 percent. Since last
summer, the jobless rate has climbed more than 2 percentage points; the
bulk of the increase in unemployment occurred among workers who lost
their last job. In April, joblessness among adult women rose to 8.3
percent, close to the 8.5 percent posted during the 1974-75 recession,
and the rate for men 25 years of age and over, 6.9 percent, now exceeds
its 1975 high by 1-1/4 percentage points. In some hard-pressed indus-
tries such as autos, steel, and trucking, unemployment among union
members has been close to 30 percent.
Nonfarm payroll employment fell 200,000 in April to a level 1-1/2
million below its peak last September. As has been the case since the
recession began, job cutbacks in April were concentrated in durable
goods manufacturing and construction. Employment in hardgoods indus-
tries fell 65,000, with layoffs at metals and machinery producers.

At construction sites, employment also was cut back further to a level
about 400,000 below its last peak, a year ago. Even employment in the
private service-producing sector has registered little growth over the
last seven months. Hiring at trade establishments has been especially
weak this spring; after seasonal adjustment, retail trade employment
fell in March and April.
Employment developments have closely paralleled production adjust-
ments in recent months. The decline in industrial production in April
probably approached the 3/4 percent drop initially estimated for March.
Raw steel output was reduced more than 10 percent, and cutbacks occurred
for other metals as well. Output of business equipment, which began to
contract sharply early in 1982, declined further in April with an especially
large drop associated with oil- and gas-well drilling. Some improve-
ment occurred in auto production and home goods output, and defense-
related output rose further. Although still depressed, auto assemblies
rose 9 percent in April to a 5.1 million unit annual rate, and the
industry currently plans to increase assemblies to a 5.6 million unit
rate in May.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Nominal personal income grew at only a 4-1/4 percent annual rate in
the first quarter. Continued weakness in labor demand and declines in
proprietors' income have held down income growth this year. In contrast,
because of the prolonged period of rising unemployment, transfer payments
have begun to pick up; in March, unemployment insurance benefits added
$4 billion at an annual rate to income growth. In real terms, disposable
income has risen in recent months as prices stabilized.

Consumer spending held up fairly well in the first quarter, as the
saving rate dropped back to 5-1/4 percent--about the same as its pre-tax
level. According to the Commerce Department, personal consumption
expenditures in real terms rose at a 4 percent annual rate. The in-
crease was attributable to a rise in purchases of motor vehicles,
supported by rebates, and in services. Apart from motor vehicles con-
sumer spending for goods remained relatively sluggish. Nominal retail
sales excluding autos and mainly nonconsumption items were essentially
unchanged from December to March. Outlays for gasoline fell sharply
due to price reductions, while spending on items in the GAF grouping
increased.
At auto dealers, unit sales of domestic models fell back to a 5.5
million annual rate in April, after averaging nearly a 6 million unit
rate in the first quarter. The end of many rebate plans in early April
may have generated the decline. Sales of imported cars dropped to a
1.8 million unit rate in April, the lowest monthly sales pace since
late 1977. The recent weakness in foreign car sales apparently stems
from export restrictions on Japanese cars.
The slower tempo of retail sales in March and, according to reports,
in April at large chain stores is consistent with the latest surveys of
consumer attitudes toward purchases of durable goods. Both the University
of Michigan and The Conference Board measures of buying plans for autos,
homes, and major appliances were at extremely depressed levels in April.
Increased pessimism reflected concerns about unemployment and high
interest rates.

Inventory Investment
Production cutbacks in recent months have led to a widespread
reduction of inventories. In constant dollar terms, manufacturing and
trade stocks declined sharply between November and February, and probably
fell further in March. This liquidation has eliminated about three-
fourths of the large buildup from April through November of 1981. Inven-
tories of new cars at domestic auto dealers have been reduced signifi-
cantly, and stocks at the end of April represented a more comfortable 68
days' supply. In March, liquidation at manufacturers regained momentum,
after slowing in February. Most manufacturers reported stock reductions,
although sizable accumulations still occurred at steel mills and at
producers of defense-related aircraft and parts. Although the constant-
dollar inventory to sales ratio for total manufacturing and trade fell
sharply in February from the record level of the preceding month, it
remains high by historical standards, suggesting some further liquida-
tion into the second quarter.
Business Fixed Investment
Indicators of capital spending have weakened since late 1981. In
the equipment area, shipments of nondefense capital goods in the first
quarter of 1982 were 3.8 percent below their fourth-quarter level. Most
types of equipment posted larger declines than that, but increased
business spending was reported in a few areas--particularly office and
store machinery. Businesses also accelerated purchases of cars and
trucks in the first quarter, presumably to take advantage of price reduc-
tions. In the structures area, nominal outlays on new construction
increased slightly during the first quarter. Spending for petroleum

drilling turned down after expanding considerably last year, while other
categories of nonresidential building activity showed small increases.
Data on near-term commitments suggest a further deterioration in
capital spending in the months ahead. Contracts and orders for plant and
equipment have declined sharply over the last two quarters, as new orders
for nondefense capital goods fell about 10 percent. The backlog of un-
filled orders has been dwindling for almost a year. Both new contracts
and permits for nonresidential construction moved lower as well during
the first quarter. The McGraw-Hill spring survey of business plans found
that fixed capital spending in 1982 will be down 4-1/2 percent in real
terms from that in 1981--a downward revision of 2-1/4 percentage points
from the February survey. In addition to these specific indicators, a
number of factors suggest that firms' incentives and capabilities to
expand capacity are being curtailed--including lower profits, reduced
business liquidity, high interest rates, and the wide margin of currently
unused capacity.
Capacity utilization rates have remained at very low levels since
the end of last year. Operating rates in manufacturing probably averaged
about 71 percent of capacity in April--just 2 percentage points above the
1975 monthly low. Capacity utilization rates for producers of industrial
materials, in general, also have continued to be depressed, owing to weak
demands and the desire of users to trim inventories
Housing
The severe slump in housing activity appears to have bottomed out.
Total private housing starts have edged up steadily this year, as have
the issuance of permits for residential building. The March building
rate of 947,000 units per year was 11 percent above its October trough,

Most measures of production bottomed out in 1975-Q1 and began to rise in the next

but this represents only an additional 100,000 units per year from the
extremely depressed October level. The upturn in starts also has been
narrow geographically, occurring entirely in the south.
Weakness in demand for housing is apparent in both sales and prices.
Sales of new and existing houses during the first quarter remained close
to their low levels of late last year. The average price of new houses
sold in March was about the same as a year earlier and would likely be
lower if it were adjusted for quality differences and interest rate "buy-
downs" by builders. The Census Bureau's quality-adjusted index of new
house prices in the first quarter stood 5-1/2 percent above its level
one year earlier. For existing houses, the reported spread of mortgage
"takebacks" by sellers probably has helped to support prices, but none-
theless the average price of existing homes sold in March was only 4
percent above a year ago, and has actually declined since December.
Federal Government
The unified deficit for the first half of fiscal year 1982 totaled
$71.9 billion, about 10 percent more than in the comparable period of
fiscal year 1981. A number of factors point to faster growth in the
deficit during the second half of FY1982. Receipts will be reduced by
the scheduled cut in withholding taxes on July 1 and by the decline in
windfall tax payments associated with tax rate cuts and lower oil prices.
Lower profits also will reduce corporate income tax receipts. Meanwhile,
the growth in outlays has remained strong as a result of the defense
buildup and rising unemployment insurance payments.

II-14
In the negotiations between the administration and Congress, a
figure of $182 billion is being used as the FY1983 "baseline" from
which deficit-reducing measures will be taken. This estimate of the
deficit is $26 billion higher than the comparable administration projec-
tion made in April. This higher estimate reflects weaker economic
assumptions about economic activity and the higher technical estimates
of disbursement rates that were made by the Congressional Budget Office.
The Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan, which the administra-
tion has endorsed, to cut the FY1983 deficit to $106.1 billion. Under
the plan, revenues would be raised $22 billion, outlays would be reduced
$47.9 billion, and the social security trust fund would be strengthened
by some unspecified combination of reduced outlays or increased revenues
totaling $6 billion.
State and Local Government
Widespread revenue shortfalls apparently are constraining activity
at state and local governments. Nominal outlays for new construction
in first quarter were off $2-1/2 billion (annual rate terms)--about 6
percent--from the already depressed 1981 level. Employment at state
and local governments also has been cut back steadily since federal
support for the public service jobs component of the CETA program ended
last October.
The recession has restrained revenue growth at a time when state
and local governments are faced with increased demands for social services.
This may account for the increase in short-term general obligation bond
issues in the first four months of this year, as well as the numerous

II-15
tax increases that were passed by state legislatures this spring. Excise
tax hikes on gasoline, alcohol, or cigarettes were passed in 17 states,
and similar proposals are currently pending in 18 other states. A number
of states also have enacted increases in income, corporate, or sales
taxes. Moreover, a recent survey indicates that of the 45 states having
income tax laws linked to federal tax laws 17 have "decoupled" in order
to prevent further erosion of revenues due to tax cuts at the federal
level. Similar measures are being considered in 11 other states.
Prices
Inflation has continued to moderate in recent months. Aggregate
measures of both consumer prices and producer prices for finished goods,
which declined in March, rose at annual rates of 1 percent or less over
the first three months of 1982. Sizable reductions in the costs of
gasoline, homeownership, and motor vehicles were the major contributors
to the recent slowing. Outside these areas, a broadly-based easing of
increases in consumer and producer prices has resulted in smaller advances
than those in the fourth quarter of last year.
Consumer energy prices fell sharply last quarter, as retail gasoline
prices dropped 8 percent (not at an annual rate). Gasoline prices
probably moved lower again in April, but the recent firming in whole-
sale markets for petroleum products suggests that prices will stabilize
in the months ahead. By contrast, natural gas and electricity rates
rose rapidly over the first quarter.
Homeownership costs as measured in the CPI dropped sharply in
March, after increasing very moderately earlier in the year. Lower
mortgage rates and house prices both contributed to the March decline.

The fall in mortgage rates mainly reflected a reduction in FHA/VA ceiling
rates from 16-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent.
Food prices declined in March and had a moderating influence on
the overall price level. A brief run-up in prices of fruits and vege-
tables in January and February due to severe winter weather was partially
reversed in March. Retail prices of meat and poultry have been little
changed so far this year, but recently at the farm level cattle and hog
prices have risen appreciably as supplies have fallen below year-earlier
levels.
Excluding food, energy, and homeownership items, consumer prices
rose at a 5-1/2 percent annual rate in the first quarter compared with
increases of nearly 9-1/2 percent or more over 1980 and 1981. New car
prices were reduced by extensive rebates early in the year and then
leveled off in March. Aside from motor vehicles, food, and energy items,
most finished goods at the producer level, including capital equipment,
also have registered smaller price increases over the first quarter.
Wages and Labor Costs
Rising unemployment and the substantial improvement in inflation
since early 1981 have significantly reduced the rate of wage inflation.
Increases in straight-time wage rates as measured by the hourly earnings
index have declined from 9-1/2 percent in 1980 to a 7 percent annual rate
in 1982-Q1. Similarly, the increase in hourly compensation, which covers
nonwage supplements as well as wages, has slowed significantly during
the past year--from the 10-1/2 percent rise over the four quarters
ended in 1981-Q1 to an 8-1/2 percent annual rate in the first quarter
of this year. A legislated hike in social security taxes effective

January 1 accounted for 3/4 percentage point of this first-quarter
figure.
Several key union settlements have been reached this year that
will build in very moderate wage increases over the next several years.
In agreements reached with the Teamsters, auto workers at Ford and
General Motors, and rubber workers at B.F. Goodrich all scheduled wage
increases were eliminated leaving only cost-of-living adjustments over
the life of these contracts. Other major labor settlements negotiated
early this year also provided smaller wage increases than in recent
years. First-year adjustments under new contracts without escalator
clauses averaged less than 8 percent during the first quarter compared
with 10-1/2 percent for those reached in 1981.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
All of the monetary aggregates registered sizable increases in April,
paced by a surge in Ml. The run-up in M1 occurred prior to the mid-month
tax date, however, and most of the rise had been retraced by month-end. As
M1 weakened, earlier pressures on bank reserve positions subsided, and money
market interest rates--which had firmed in the latter part of April--eased
somewhat in early May. Most short- and long-term market yields have declined
1/2 to 1 percentage point on balance since the March 30 meeting of the FOMC.
The high level of interest rates in April continued to restrain the
aggregate volume of credit demanded and to encourage emphasis on short-term
borrowing. In the first quarter, total funds raised in credit markets by
nonfinancial sectors rose only slightly from the pace of the final quarter
of last year. Borrowing by the U.S. government slowed somewhat in the
first quarter, but it still accounted for just under 30 percent of all
funds raised. Other domestic nonfinancial sectors took down an increased
volume of credit in U.S. markets, reflecting an apparent step-up in mort-
gage borrowing by households from the deeply depressed level of the preced-
ing quarter. Aggregate business borrowing is estimated to have remained
near the reduced fourth-quarter pace.
The intermeeting period was marked by three large filings under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy statute, and business failures in
general continued to mount. Despite seemingly intensified concerns
about the ability of many domestic and foreign borrowers to deal with
their indebtedness, the financial markets remained orderly. If there
was any increased tendency toward a "flight to quality" by investors, it
was not readily apparent in the structure of market interest rates.

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 grew at an 11-3/4 percent annual rate in April, following a small
net decline during the previous two months. Growth in M1 in April may be
overstated because seasonal factors may not fully capture the effects of
deposit-churning around the mid-April tax dates. All components of M1
strengthened in April, with other checkable deposits again posting a sub-
stantial increase. Since October of last year, OCDs have accounted for
more than 85 percent of M1 growth. Like the other components of M1, how-
ever, the level of OCDs declined appreciably in late April.

III-3
M2 growth slowed in April to an annual rate of 9-1/2 percent from
11-1/4 percent in March. Contributing to a deceleration in its nontrans-
action component was a slowing of inflows to general purpose and broker/
dealer money market mutual funds, probably reflecting withdrawals for
income tax payments. (Money fund flows are not seasonally adjusted.)
M2 growth in April was understated by a reporting difficulty that caused
many overnight RPs issued over the extended Easter weekend to be classi-
fied as term RPs.
A small contraction in savings deposits in April also contributed
to slowing in the rate of growth of the nontransaction component of M2.
While the April weakness followed substantial growth in the first quarter
of 1982, incoming data indicate no resumption--at least as yet--of run-offs
of the magnitude experienced from April to October 1981. The relative
strengthening in savings deposits since last October has occurred despite
highly unfavorable rate spreads. Recent econometric research by the Board
staff suggests that the demand for savings deposits tends to rise with the
unemployment rate, supporting the view that the behavior of savings depos-
its--and by inference, OCDs--is partly attributable to enhanced liquidity
preference in light of uncertain income and employment prospects.
Small time deposits accelerated in April. Nevertheless, thrift
institutions continued to receive only small net inflows, as growth of
their SSCs was partly offset by outflows from MMCs. Growth at commercial
banks remained more robust; since the end of 1980, commercial banks have
garnered all of the net inflows to MMCs. These patterns reflect, at least
in part, the uniformity of MMC ceiling rates across institutions and the
differential favoring thrifts on SSCs. Total savings and small time deposit

growth at commercial banks in April also was quite strong relative to
thrift institutions. The recent widening in the margin of growth favoring
banks may reflect greater concern about the soundness of thrifts.
M3 grew at an 11-1/4 percent annual rate in April-the same as in
March. Holiday-related expansion in term RPs was accompanied by no change
in institution-only money market mutual funds. Gross issuance of large
time deposits moderated in April at both thrift institutions and banks.
However, issuance by banks net of acquisitions by money market funds accel-
erated slightly in April, reflecting substantial run-offs of such instru-
ments by money funds. The slower growth of large time deposits at banks
occurred as core deposits picked up.
While bank credit growth--at a 7-3/4 percent rate--was unchanged
from March, banks added appreciably to their holdings of Treasury securi-
ties. Total loans slowed, owing largely to a marked decline in business
loan expansion. A pickup in business lending at large domestically char-
tered banks was partly offset by a halt in small-bank lending and a faster
run-off in business loans at foreign-related institutions. Consumer loans
were about flat in April, extending the weakness of recent months. Real.
estate lending--at a 7-1/2 percent rate--approximated the pace of the past
three quarters.
Business Finance
Weak economic activity and high interest rates have continued to
put severe strains on many businesses. Bankruptcy filings rose to a
record in the first quarter, averaging a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of more than 54,000 (see chart on page 111-7). The filing of Wickes Com-
panies in late April was second in terms of liabilities involved only to

the Penn Central filing in 1970; AM International and Saxon Industries
also filed in April. Together these three Chapter 11 bankruptcies--which
permit the firms to continue as on-going concerns--reportedly involved
nearly $3 billion in liabilities owed to more than 25,000 creditors.
Business failures also have been quite high.1 If the estimated
faster pace of recent months should continue throughout 1982, failures
would reach the highest level since the early 1930s. With the tremendous
postwar growth in the number of businesses in operation, failures as a
proportion of total firms have risen less steeply. Nevertheless, Dun
and Bradstreet's index of failures per 10,000 concerns seems certain at
this point to be above its postwar high in 1961.
The combination of high interest rates and heavy reliance on short-
term or floating-rate financing has exacerbated the cash flow problems of
many companies. The fraction of corporate earnings (before interest and
taxes) being devoted to net interest payments rose from 21 percent in 1979
to a postwar record of 36 percent in the fourth quarter of 1981. Given
the apparent weakness in corporate earnings during the first quarter of
1982, this ratio probably rose still further.
Despite the slump in profits, the financing gap of nonfinancial cor-
porations (the difference between capital expenditures and internal funds)
is estimated to have narrowed markedly in the first quarter of the year,
as inventories were slashed. The staff forecast for the current quarter
1. Business failure data, collected by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc., includes
only commercial and industrial businesses that have ceased operations or
are involved in court actions that are likely to lead to a loss to credi-
tors. Data on bankruptcies represent the number of nonpersonal filings
for protection from creditors under provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
as reported by the U.S. Courts.

III-9
suggests that the gap may shrink further. The reduced gap in the first
quarter was accompanied by a diminution in total long-term funds raised
by business firms, but borrowing remained heavy in shorter-term markets.
Of the $108 billion raised by nonfinancial corporations in the first quar-
ter, $72 billion was in loans and short-term paper. In April, however,
nonfinancial businesses reduced their issuance of commercial paper while
also cutting back their net borrowing at commercial banks.

Considerations of quality appear to have posed no particular problem
in commercial paper markets. While spreads between commercial paper and
Treasury bills widened somewhat in April, the differential between medium-
grade and high-grade paper remained within the relatively narrow range
experienced during much of the past year. Despite many recent reports
of greater selectivity by money market fund managers in their commercial
paper investments, dealers continue to find no difficulty in placing paper.

According to informal contacts with dealers, the volume of paper rated
A-2, P-2, or lower is not substantially higher (10 percent of the total)
than a year or two ago. However, a large number of issuers reportedly
have obtained standby letters of credit to support their paper, thereby
retaining their A-1, P-1 ratings. Dealers indicate that the relative
volume of such paper is also in the 10 percent range.
Historically high interest rates have continued to discourage long-
term corporate borrowing; the volume of public corporate bond offerings
fell in April to a seasonally adjusted $1.6 billion. The recent weakness
in public offerings by U.S. corporations in domestic bond markets has been
accompanied by a sizable increase in the Eurobond offerings. Very favor-
able rates in European markets apparently spurred an estimated monthly
average of $1.4 billion of such borrowing during the first quarter of 1982
and $1.8 billion in April.
Most measures of corporate bond yields declined marginally in April;
specifically, both the Salomon Brothers new-issue index for Aaa utilities
and Moody's seasoned, Aaa corporate bond index declined by about 10 basis
points.1 Rate spreads between high- and low-quality bonds--like spreads
in the paper market--showed little change in recent weeks. Moreover, the
number of rating reductions of corporate bonds slackened in April.
Share prices rose gradually throughout April as interest rates on
Treasury securities fell; most major composite indexes are now 6 to 8 per-
cent higher than at the time of the last FOMC meeting. Equity offerings
in April totaled $1-1/2 billion--mostly by utilities.
1. In contrast, the Federal Reserve recently-offered series increased in
April before declining in early May. Technical difficulties apparently
caused this index to be artifically depressed in March.

Government Finance
Federal Sector. The Treasury's combined deficit is expected to total
about $8 billion during the second quarter--a period of the year when the
Treasury usually runs a substantial surplus. As a consequence, net market-
able borrowing may be around $16 billion for the April-June period.1 This
would be the largest second-quarter figure since 1975. Of this total, $3.2
billion was raised during April. The Treasury raised $4.6 billion of new
cash last month through sales of 2- and 7-year notes, but these funds were
partly offset by a net run-off of bills. The Treasury also raised about $3
billion of new money in the May mid-quarter refunding through the sale of 3-
and 10-year notes. Having reached the statutory limit on issuance of bonds
with coupons greater than 4-1/4 percent, the Treasury was unable to offer
long-term bonds in May as it typically does in quarterly refundings.2
The federally sponsored credit agencies are estimated to have bor-
rowed $2.3 billion in April--compared with $1.8 billion in the entire first
quarter. So far this year, the Federal Home Loan Bank System has accounted
for the largest share of agency borrowing, with much of the rest attribut-
able to the Federal Farm Credit Banks. In addition, FNMA borrowed $500
million in the first quarter to finance slightly over $1 billion in net
mortgage purchases. FNMA also issued $2.1 billion in securities backed by
conventional mortgages during the first quarter, most of which were issued
to mortgage lenders under the swap program that FNMA initiated late in 1981
1. The Treasury has announced that it expects to borrow $15-1/2 billion
during the current quarter, slightly below the Board staff estimate.
2. The ceiling on bond issues also forced the Treasury to cancel the sched-
uled sale of 20-year bonds in early April. Unless Congress takes action in
the next five weeks, the ceiling will prevent a similar auction scheduled
for late June.

for low-rate seasoned mortgages. In mid-March, FNMA opened the program
to new mortgages.1
State and Local Sector. Since the last FOMC meeting, municipal
bond markets have experienced both a massive volume of issuance and a
marked decline in yields from near-record levels. Gross funds raised in
the long-term tax-exempt market were a record $6.0 billion (seasonally
adjusted) in April.2

The heavy demand for funds--despite declining spending by state and local
governments and high interest rates--may reflect shortfalls in revenues
associated with depressed economic activity and cuts in aid from the
1. The FHLMC also started a similar swap program in mid-1981, opening
the program to new mortgages in March. Through December 1981, FHLMC
had issued $2.3 billion of participation certificates under the swap
program and another $4 billion had been issued by the end of March.
2. In the short-term tax-exempt market, gross sales--measured on a sea-
sonally adjusted basis--declined substantially in April, owing to post-
ponement of a $3.5 billion sale of New York State notes that typically
are brought to market during April. The sale, for which approval of a
state budget is a prerequisite, is now tentatively slated for May.

III-15
federal government. General obligation issues have accounted for an
increased share of bond offerings this year, and sales of housing revenue
bonds have picked up recently.
Despite the distinct shift toward long-term offerings, the yield
curve for municipal obligations flattened noticeably during the intermeet-
ing period. Also, risk premiums--as measured by the ratio of municipal to
Treasury rates or the yield spread between prime- and medium-grade general
obligations--declined during April, notwithstanding the fiscal pressures
facing many states and localities.
In recent weeks, dealers have attributed the improved performance
of the municipal bond market to an increase in demand for these securities
by property/liability insurance companies and bank trust departments. The
profitability of the insurance companies has not changed in a way that
would explain a renewed interest in tax-exempt income; however, one plaus-
ible interpretation of dealers' comments is that insurance companies have
decided that now is a propitious time to lengthen maturities.
Mortgage Markets
Net mortgage lending in the first quarter of 1982 rose nearly a
third from the depressed fourth-quarter volume to an estimated seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $92 billion. The total, nevertheless, was slightly
less than half the peak volume recorded three years earlier. Except for
mutual savings banks, all major types of mortgage lenders are estimated
to have expanded their holdings of mortgages. Savings and loan associa-
tions--which as a group in the final quarter of 1981 registered the first
seasonally adjusted run-off in mortgage holdings since data collection
began in 1955--registered a small gain in the first quarter.

Moreover, recently initiated programs in which lenders swap seasoned
loans for FHLMC or FNMA securities have had down the recorded net expansion
in mortgage lending by selling institutions. For instance, S&Ls reportedly
removed more than $4 billion of seasoned mortgages from their books (not
at an annual rate) in the first quarter through swaps, compared with $2.3
billion during the eight preceding months. After allowing for these swaps,
S&Ls apparently increased their holdings of mortgages by a sizable amount
in the first quarter of the year.
Regarding future lending activity, new mortgage commitments at S&Ls
fell somewhat in March to $4.5 billion, but remained well above the recent
lows registered last fall. In addition, purchase commitments in secondary
markets have picked up noticeably. At the end of March, commitments out-
standing at federal and related credit agencies to buy new mortgages were
at the highest level since September 1980.
Mortgage interest rates have continued to drift lower. By early May,
the average contract interest rate for fixed-rate, level-payment conven-
tional home mortgages at S&Ls had declined about 25 basis points since the
last FOMC meeting to nearly 16-3/4 percent--the lowest level since last
summer. In early April, closing rates on conventional home loans--which
reflect some types of creative financing techniques commonly used to lower
mortgage interest costs to home buyers--slightly exceeded 15 percent for
both new and existing homes.
Adjustable-rate mortgage instruments have been growing in relative
importance. In March, 45 percent of conventional first mortgage loans
closed carried an adjustable-rate feature of some sort. The use of such
instruments by commercial banks and mortgage bankers has increased sharply

in recent months. Growth in the popularity of ARMs with mortgage bankers
no doubt reflects an increased ability of originators to sell such mort-
gages. New commitments by FNMA to purchase adjustable-rate mortgages--a
program initiated only last summer--rose in March to almost a billion
dollars and constituted two-thirds of total new commitments during the
month. Finally, a recent survey of home builders shows that adjustable-
rate mortgages were the most common means of financing new homes sold,
just edging out traditional fixed-rate loans without buy-downs.
Thrift Institutions
While mortgage lending by thrift institutions picked up in the first
quarter, the industry's support of mortgage markets has remained limited
by generally weak deposit flows and profitability problems. Savings and
small time deposits at all S&Ls grew at a modest 3 percent annual rate in
April. S&Ls have relied on managed liabilities to supplement deposit
growth in recent months, with FHLB advances increasing substantially in
March for the third month in a row. Uncertainties have induced thrifts
to continue to increase holdings of cash and liquid assets; in March the
industry's aggregate liquidity ratio rose to its highest level in more
than a year.
The net worth of insured S&Ls declined $671 million in March,
bringing industry losses in the first three months of this year close to
$1.8 billion. Thirty mergers of thrifts have been arranged so far in
1982 with financial assistance from the FSLIC and FDIC, compared with 33
all last year. Five of the recent mergers have been so-called "phoenix"
mergers, in which two or more weak institutions have been merged with
federal financial assistance. The FSLIC exercises more stringent management

Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding rose in March at a 3-1/2
percent annual rate; this contrasted with virtually no net growth in
February. During the first quarter, reductions in amounts outstanding
of automobile credit, revolving credit, and mobile home financing were
offset by an increase in non-auto consumer goods financing and personal
loans--a reversal of general patterns observed in the fourth quarter of
1981.
Low relative profitability of consumer loans has played a key role
in the recent sluggishness of consumer installment lending. The yield
spread between consumer loan rates and the cost of deposit funds--which
has tracked well historically against changes in the willingness of large
commercial banks to commit funds to consumer credit--has remained rela-
tively narrow (see chart on page 111-22). With a view toward improving
profits, suppliers of consumer credit have been marketing variable-rate
loan contracts that tie revenues more closely to the cost of funds. House-
hold surveys indicate that about 10 percent of closed-end installment cre-
dit contracts outstanding have rates that can vary during the term of the
loan. Lenders also have been turning to second mortgage financing as a
more profitable substitute for traditional forms of closed-end consumer
installment credit. This trend, along with high interest rates and avail-
ability constraints in many areas, helps to explain the decline in the pro-
portion of households that owe money on fixed-maturity consumer installment

Despite an increasingly adverse economic environment, the
first-quarter evidence on household debt difficulties does not suggest
markedly increased distress. Delinquency rates on mortgage loans at
savings and loan associations reached a new high, but foreclosure rates
have remained well below 1 percent.1 Personal bankruptcy filings rose
to a record high during the quarter. At the same time, delinquency rates
on automobile loans at finance companies declined to a 13-year low.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown by the chart on the next page, the dollar continued
under upward pressure during the three weeks following the last FOMC
meeting, appreciating by about 1/2 percent on a weighted-average basis
A major factor underlying the dollar's strength was market
sentiment that the Federal Reserve's reaction to an anticipated April
money-supply bulge would push dollar interest rates higher in the
near term. That sentiment began to erode when dollar interest rates
did not move higher following the April 16 announcement of a $7.1
billion increase in Ml. During the subsequent 3-1/2 weeks the dollar
depreciated by about 5 percent as the view that dollar interest rates
might decline in the near term was supported by continued indications
of weak U.S. economic activity and the announcement of a March decline
in the consumer price index, together with the prospect that continuing
negotiations between the Administration and Congress would eventually
lead to significant reductions in projected U.S. budget deficits.
The announcement of the German trade and current-account surplusses
for March also contributed to the dollar's decline against the con-
tinental European currencies.

Italian exchange controls were tightened in mid-April by reducing the
lead times that are permitted in purchasing foreign exchange to meet
import payments and the lag times for converting foreign-exchange
receipts from exports into lira.
Mexico announced a new austerity program in April, as previous
actions taken shortly after the February devaluation -- in particular,
the granting of large wage increases -- had contributed to renewed
downward pressure on the spot value of the Mexican currency and sub-
stantial forward discounts on the peso. The austerity program announced
in April envisions substantial further reductions in government spending,
increases in public sector prices, lower imports, and a reduction in
public-sector external borrowing.
The most substantial changes in foreign short-term interest
rates since the last FOMC meeting are the declines of more than 2-1/2
percentage points in Swiss interbank rates and about 1/2 percentage
point in rates paid for interbank sterling and mark deposits, along
with an increase of 3/4 percentage point in Belgian interest rates.

IV-4
The reduction in German interest rates was associated with the closing
of the special Lombard facility on May 6, which had been granting
loans at 9-1/2 percent, and the reopening of the regular Lombard window
at 9 percent. The relative decline in Swiss interest rates weakened
the franc to a cross rate of around .84 francs per mark, compared with
.80 francs per mark at the time of the last FOMC meeting.
The outbreak of the Falkland Islands hostilities contributed
to a sharp rise in gold prices from around $320 an ounce at the end
of March to more than $365 an ounce in mid-April. Subsequently, the
price of gold has declined to around $335 an ounce.

U.S. International Transactions
U.S. Merchandise Trade. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit for
the first quarter of 1982 was about $13 billion smaller at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate than the deficit recorded in the fourth quarter of
last year, and was also slightly lower than the deficit for the year 1981
as a whole. Weakening economic activity in the United States and in
its major trading partners, an appreciating dollar, and falling world
prices of various major commodities (particularly oil and agricultural
products) significantly affected first quarter exports and imports. As
a result, the value of both imports and exports fell in the first quarter.

The decline in imports brought the value in the first quarter below
the level in any quarter last year. The decrease from the fourth quarter
was about evenly split between oil and nonoil commodity categories. The
value of oil imports declined 13 percent in the first quarter, most of
which was accounted for by a drop in volume. (See the table below.) Oil
import prices declined somewhat in the first quarter, but it now seems
likely that oil exporting countries will be able to prevent a further
drop. Spot prices, although still below official

OPEC prices, have firmed by $3 to $5 per barrel during the last month.
Total OPEC oil production appears to be keeping within OPEC's desired
limits (17.5 million barrels per day).
The first quarter decline in nonoil imports was concentrated in
industrial supplies (especially building materials, metals, and paper),
machinery, civilian aircraft, and sugar. The declines reflected in large
part weak U.S. economic activity at the end of last year and the
beginning of this year. The large decline in the value of sugar imports
resulted from falling prices as well as falling volume. Sugar prices
have dropped because of extremely large worldwide sugar supplies
including a big EC sugar beet crop. No further drop in U.S. import
prices is expected because the President has imposed sugar quotas

without raising the tariff or import fee. Foreign producers assigned a
quota are likely to reap a windfall. The value of steel imports was up
10 percent for the first quarter as a whole, but March imports dropped
sharply, presumably reflecting the lagged impact of the steel industry's
dumping suits. The value of foreign automotive imports was little
changed from fourth-quarter levels; a small increase in the value of
vehicles was offset by a decline in parts.
Most of the export decline in the first quarter was in manufactured
goods, particularly metals, machinery and consumer goods, to levels lower
than in any quarter of 1981. One offset to the general weakening export
picture was sharply rising exports of petroleum products. Since
restrictions were lifted in October 1981, product exports have risen from
an average annual rate of $3.4 billion during the first three quarters of
1981 to an annual rate of $7.0 billion in the first quarter of this year.
Export restrictions are still in effect for crude oil exports.
Only a small part of the export decline in the first quarter was
due to agricultural exports. Many commodities recorded decreases,
particularly feedgrains (both prices and volume of corn), but a very
strong increase in wheat exports offset most of the decline. The
increase in wheat exports was largely in volume, especially shipments to
the U.S.S.R. As of mid-April, the U.S.S.R. had bought 6 million metric
tons of wheat and 7.8 million metric tons of corn. Under the
U.S./U.S.S.R. Grain Agreement, the U.S.S.R. may buy 8 million metric

month.)
U.S. International Capital Transactions. The sharp appreciation
of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 1982 was associated with
large intervention sales of dollars by the G-10 countries and
Switzerland and with a $6.7 billion reduction in their official reserve
assets in the United States. Partial information from the FRBNY
indicates a further decline of $3 billion in G-10 holdings of official
reserve assets in the United States in April. In contrast, OPEC
official reserve assets in the United States increased by $5.0 billion
in the first quarter, and partial information indicates an additional
$0.5 billion increase in April. Overall, the net reduction in foreign
official assets in the United States in the first quarter of 1982
resulted in a $2.1 billion decline in their holdings of U.S. Treasury
securities.
Bank reported private capital transactions in the first quarter of
1982 showed a small net outflow. Claims on nonbanks in foreign countries
grew rapidly as did liabilities to private nonbanks in foreign
countries, partly reflecting the growth of IBF's.
The growing involvement of U.S. residents in offshore financial
markets continued to be evident in early 1982. Credit extended to U.S.
residents by foreign branches of U.S. banks increased in March and

IV -10
April, continuing the trend evident since the end of 1980. (See line 2
of the table below.) Credit arrangements providing the borrower with the
option of choosing between a LIBOR or prime-based rate have continued to
become more widespread and banks have generally booked LIBOR-based loans
offshore. Because choice of the LIBOR option implies fixing the interest
rate for an agreed term, the choice between the two options hinges on
interest rate expectations as well as the current differential between
the two rates. In March and April the differential between prime and
LIBOR widened only marginally compared to the previous two months.

The Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbank residents reached
approximately $100 billion in January and remained there in February.
(See line 3 of the table.) One component of these holdings, overnight
Eurodollar deposits, has averaged about $2 billion lower in March and
April than in January and February. Possible explanations for this
decline include reduced liquidity for major corporations associated with
lower profits (e.g., oil companies) or decisions to lengthen the term of
investments.
U.S. corporations have also been heavy borrowers in the Eurobond
markets. In the first four months of 1982, U.S. companies raised $6.1
billion through Eurobond issues, compared with only $1.5 billion in the
same period last year. During the same four months of 1982, U.S.
domestic bond issues (public and private) raised $8.5 billion. U.S.
activity in the Eurobond markets has been notable not only because of
its size, but also because of the participation of firms that are
domestic rather than multinational in character. For example, in 1980
U.S. public utilities raised $50 million in the Eurobond market, while
in the first and second halves of 1981 they raised $165 and $625 million
respectively, and in January through April of 1982 they raised over $900
million. Apparently many firms find it to their advantage to issue
bonds in the Euromarkets. Precise comparisons of costs to borrowers and
returns to investors are difficult to make because distribution
practices in the Euromarkets are less transparent than practices in the
U.S. domestic bond market.

IV -12
Several factors may be important in explaining the rapid recent
growth in Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations. First, U.S.
corporations recently have found it in their interest to tailor their
issues to coincide with the asset preferences of foreigners.
Maturities in the Eurobond markets are commonly medium term (around 10
years) rather than long term. Zero coupon issues were very attractive
to Japanese investors until sales of such bonds in Japan were banned.
(There have been only two zero coupon issues in the Euromarket since
the end of February.) Second, because of interest rate and exchange
rate expectations, foreign demand for dollar denominated assets,
including bonds, has been strong. Some foreigners may be deterred from
buying bonds on the U.S. domestic market because of withholding tax or
because domestically issued bonds are generally not bearer bonds. On
the other hand,the withholding tax rate applied depends on a series of
bilateral tax treaties; many foreigners are subject to a zero rate. It
would not be very difficult for many foreign investors to circumvent
the withholding tax. While many foreigners in principle could be
attracted to purchase new issues in the domestic U.S. bond market
rather than the Eurobond market, it is probably less costly to attract
foreign investors by using existing channels to distribute bonds to
foreigners -the Eurobond market.

IV -13
Foreign Economic Developments. The general pattern of economic
developments in the major foreign industrial countries is one of weak
economic activity and moderating inflation. Following a decline in
real GNP in the final quarter of last year, Japanese economic activity
has remained weak; in March industrial production (s.a.) fell for the
fifth consecutive month. In Germany, industrial production (s.a.) in
the first quarter of this year was below the depressed level registered
in the fourth quarter of last year. In France and Italy, increases in
real GDP (s.a.) were recorded in the final quarter of 1981, but other
evidence indicates that activity in both countries remains weak. In
Canada, industrial production (s.a.) fell in February, marking the
eighth consecutive month in which this index has declined. In the
United Kingdom, industrial production (s.a.) resumed the upward path
that began in the middle of last year but which was interrupted by de-
clines in November and December. Nevertheless, U.K. activity remains
at depressed levels, with industrial production in February below the
level reached in October 1981.
In Japan, the April consumer price index was 3-1/2 percent above
the level recorded a year earlier; at the end of last year this infla-
tion measure stood at 4-1/2 percent. Similarly, in Germany, the April
figure was 5 percent compared to a December 1981 rate of 6-1/2 percent.
April data for the other major foreign industrial countries are not yet
available, but data for earlier months in 1982 indicate a similar moder-
ation in price advances. An exception to this trend is France, where
consumer prices in March were just over 14 percent above their March
1981 level -- a rate of inflation equal to that recorded in December of
last year.

The Japanese, German, French, and Canadian trade balances (s.a.)
so far this year are little changed from the levels recorded in the
fourth quarter of 1981. The German trade surplus in the fourth quarter
of 1981 and the first quarter of this year represents a marked strength-
ening of the German trade account. The U.K.'s external accounts
weakened in January, but in February the trade account registered a
positive swing of over $500 million (s.a.). Data for 1982 indicate a
substantial weakening in the Italian trade balance (s.a.).
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, signs of continued stagnation
in the domestic economy are evident, while debate over possible measures
to stimulate demand has intensified. February industrial production
(s.a.) was revised downward sharply to show now a slight decline from
the January level, and in March industrial production fell by an
additional 1 percent, making this the fifth consecutive monthly decline.
The mid-April assessments by both the Japanese Economic Planning Agency
and the Bank of Japan pointed to the slowdown in exports as a key factor
in the stagnation of demand, but recognized that domestic demand remains
sluggish as well. Leading indicators of household consumption have been
erratic in recent months but suggest continued weakness, and housing
starts remain at a low level.
The softness in demand has been reflected in recent price develop-
ments. Although consumer prices increased slightly more rapidly in
April than in previous months, the average level in the three months
ending in April was less than 3 percent (a.r.) above the previous three
month's level. Wholesale price pressures have been even milder, despite
the yen's weakness in recent months; the WPI rose at a less than 1 per-
cent annual rate in the first quarter.

The Japanese current account (s.a.) moved back into small surplus
in March, as a decline in exports was more than matched by reduced
imports. With the exception of an abnormally high level in January, ex-
port volume has declined in recent months to a level some 5 percent
below mid-1981 levels, while export prices have remained essentially
unchanged in dollar terms. Recently released figures show that vehicle
exports from Japan fell in FY 1981 (which ended in March) by nearly 5
percent, a shift largely attributable to restraints on exports to the
United States and several West European countries.
Continuation of the slowdown has added to mounting pressures to
take steps to stimulate the economy. In April, it was announced that
more than three-quarters of public-works spending would be made in the
first half of the fiscal year -- an unusually heavy degree of frontload-
ing. A package of additional measures designed both to stimulate
domestic demand and reduce the external surplus is expected to be
announced later this month. A slowdown in tax collections in recent
months makes it almost certain that the Suzuki government will have to
give way on its program to eliminate the issuance of government-deficit
bonds by FY 1984. In April, the Bank of Japan announced its projection
for M2 growth in the April-June quarter of 10 percent (on a year-over-
year basis), down slightly from an estimated 10-3/4 percent growth in
the first quarter. A strengthening of the yen in recent weeks, however,
may provide the authorities with scope for a more expansionary monetary
stance.
Economic activity in Germany remains weak and available data do not
point to an impending broadly based recovery. Industrial production (s.a.)

IV -19
fell in March, and the first quarter level was below that recorded in the
fourth quarter of last year. The total volume of orders as of March
does not indicate new strength. Domestic orders for investment goods
are particularly weak, and orders from abroad declined in March. Un-
employment has continued to rise this year, reaching a post-war record
of 7.3 percent (s.a.) in April.
The consumer price index rose 1/2 percent in April to a level 5
percent above April of last year. The downward trend of inflation is
visible in seasonally adjusted data, according to which the rate of in-
flation in the first quarter of this year was down to just over 3 per-
cent (s.a.a.r.) from 6-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
This year's wage round is substantially complete, with settlements
averaging about 4-1/2 percent. A notable exception is the public
employees' union, which is holding out for a larger wage increase.
German monetary policy has continued to ease slightly. On March 19,
the Special Lombard rate, which had reached a peak last year of 12 per-
cent, was reduced from 10 to 9-1/2 percent. On May 6, the Special
Lombard facility was discontinued altogether and the Bundesbank returned
to its regular Lombard facility at the rate (9 percent) prevailing when
it left the regular facility on February 19 of last year.
French GDP grew by over 5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter
of 1981, after a stagnant third quarter. However, in the first two
months of 1982, industrial production fell and was 3 percent below the
fourth quarter's level. Recent surveys indicate that the pace of
economic activity is slowing; an investment survey indicates that real
industrial investment may fall by 7 percent this year. Consumer price

IV -20
inflation declined slightly in the first quarter of this year, perhaps
in part because of the limited price controls in effect during the
quarter.
M2 growth was nearly stagnant in the final quarter of last year
but grew by over 20 percent (s.a.a.r.) between December and February.
In April, the French government acted to reduce the burdens on firms of
recent government decisions. The measures taken include: a reduction
in payroll taxes of FF 11 billion over two years, freezing employer
social security contributions until mid-1983, suspension of any
additional government mandated reductions in the work week until 1984,
and increased access to low interest loans.
In the United Kingdom, revised industrial production (s.a.) data
for January indicate a slight increase over the December 1981 level, and
between January and February a further 1/2 percent increase was recorded.
Thus the weakness in industrial production exhibited at the end of last
year seems to have been only a temporary interruption of the recovery in
economic activity that began in mid-1981. Nevertheless, because of the
declines registered in November and December of last year, industrial
production in February was 2 percent below the level reached in October
1981 and equal to the level prevailing in February 1981. The U.K. un-
employment rate resumed its climb in April, reaching 11.9 percent (s.a.).
Consumer prices in March were 10-1/2 percent higher than their
year-earlier level. In the six-month period to March, consumer prices
increased only 8-1/2 percent (a.r.). The twelve-month rate of wholesale
price inflation was in single digits (9 percent) in April; between
October 1981 and April wholesale prices rose 8-1/2 percent (a.r.).

IV -21
British wages have continued to decelerate. In the six months to Feb-
ruary 1982, average wage earnings increased only 7-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.)
compared to a rate of increase of 15-1/2 percent in the previous six-
month period.
The U.K.'s current account in 1981 is estimated to have been in
surplus by about $16 billion -- more than twice the surplus recorded in
1980. However, because of last year's civil service labor dispute,
trade data for 1981 are not complete. In the first two months of this
year, the average current-account surplus was about $900 million (s.a.).
In his budget speech of March 9, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Sir Geoffrey Howe estimated that the U.K.'s public sector borrowing re-
quirement (PSBR) for the fiscal year ending that month (fiscal year
1981-82) was £ 10-1/2 billion, 4-1/4 percent of GDP. On April 22,
the British government announced that the PSBR for fiscal 1981-82 had
turned out to be only £ 8-1/2 billion, 3-1/2 percent of GDP. The U.K.
authorities have not yet revised their PSBR forecast of £ 9-1/2 billion
(3-1/2 percent of GDP) for fiscal 1982-83.
In Canada, there are no signs that the recession that started in
the middle of last year has begun to bottom out. In February, the in-
dex of industrial production (s.a.) fell slightly -- this represents
the eighth consecutive monthly decline in this index. The unemployment
rate (s.a.) rose to a post-war record 9.6 percent in April from 9 percent
in March. Employment (s.a.) fell for the eighth consecutive month in
April.

IV -22
Associated with the downturn in real economic activity has been
a slowing of inflation. Inflation, as measured by the percentage change
in the CPI from a year earlier, peaked at 13 percent in July 1981 and
trended downwards to roughly 11-1/2 percent in March.
The Canadian trade balance (s.a.) for the first quarter of this
year posted a $2.8 billion surplus, twice the surplus registered in the
same quarter a year ago. The cyclical downturn of the Canadian economy
was primarily responsible for the larger trade surplus this year rela-
tive to 1981.
Revised data indicate a slight fall (-1/4 percent) in Italian
real GDP in 1981 on a year-over-year basis and a slight rise (1/2 per-
cent) between the fourth quarters of 1980 and 1981. These data show
very rapid real growth during the fourth quarter -- almost 11 percent
(s.a.a.r.) -- but this growth rate is believed to reflect faulty
seasonal adjustment rather than the beginning of a strong recovery. In
February, industrial production was 1-1/2 percent above its February
1981 level.
Inflation has continued to subside as a result of the weakness
of demand. Consumer prices in March were 16-1/2 percent above their
year-earlier level, compared with a 20 percent rise in the twelve months
ending in March 1981. After rising during most of last year, wholesale
price inflation decelerated to less than 16 percent in the twelve months
to March.
The trade deficit in the first quarter of this year was larger
than that in the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting in part the
unwinding of the import deposit scheme. In response to the widening

IV -23
trade deficit, the authorities tightened exchange controls.
The Italian government's budget proposals were passed by Parlia-
ment on April 29, six months after being submitted. As reported in the
press, compromises by the government will result in a deficit of about
60 trillion lire (13 percent of GDP) this year, compared with the
government's original 1982 target of 50 trillion lire and an actual
deficit of 55 trillion lire (14 percent of GDP) in 1981. Supplementary
proposals are being considered, but the weakness of the present coali-
tion suggests that a consensus on such proposals will be difficult to
attain. In another policy move, the Bank of Italy increased the penalty
for bank lending in lire in excess of existing ceilings, to be effective
at the end of May.
