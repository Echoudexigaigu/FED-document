The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
There were signs that economic activity leveled off in May, as con-
sumer demand firmed. Employment and industrial production were little
changed, following several months of steep declines. Increased produc-
tion of autos mostly offset continued reductions in the output of basic
metals and business equipment. Investment demand appears to be declining
as indicated by the prolonged weakness in orders for capital goods and
downward revisions in business spending plans. Except for the reversal
in food and energy, price increases continued to moderate.
Employment and Industrial Production
Labor demand appeared to be about unchanged in May, after contrac-
ting steadily since the pre-recession peak last July. Nonfarm payroll
employment, as measured by the establishment survey, remained about
constant between April and May. However, initial claims for unemployment
insurance benefits have remained very high into early June--an indication
that substantial layoffs still were occurring in some industries.
The overall unemployment rate was 9.5 percent in May, about the
same as April's 9.4 percent, with the household survey showing substan-
tial increases in both employment and the labor force. However, these
sharp jumps appear to be attributable to a seasonal influx of summer
job-seekers that formerly were reflected in the June survey but now seem
to be shifting into the May report. When new seasonal factors are intro-
duced next month, the large May increases in the labor force and house-
hold employment could be revised downward significantly.
Industrial production also held fairly constant in May, edging
down an estimated 0.2 percent following declines of 0.8 percent in each

of the two preceding months. Output of business equipment and basic
metals continued to drop sharply, while production of consumer goods
rose again, primarily due to about a 10 percent increase in auto assem-
blies. Overall, industrial production in May was 8.8 percent below its
recent peak in July 1981.
Capacity utilization for total manufacturing declined 0.2 percen-
tage point in May, to 70.8 percent. The operating rate for industrial
materials production dropped 0.6 percentage point to 69.9 percent--only
half a percentage point above its March 1975 low. The declines in both
the manufacturing and materials rates were more moderate than in March
and April.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Personal income rose at an 8 percent annual rate in May, after
increasing at a 4 percent rate in the two previous months. Wage and
salary disbursements increased in May, after declining in March and April
when employment fell sharply in goods-producing industries. Interest
income and unemployment insurance benefit payments continued to rise
substantially. Real disposable personal income has been edging up in
recent months, despite a probable decline in May due to the concentration
in March and April of tax relief on some 1981 federal tax liabilities.
Consumer purchases picked up in May, and consumer confidence also
showed some further improvement. Domestic-model autos sold at a 6.4
million unit annual rate, up from the 5.5 million rate in April. Sales
of these cars continued at an annual rate of 6.1 million units in the
first ten days of June, even though GM discontinued its popular 12.8
percent financing promotion. Foreign car sales increased in May to an

annual rate of 2.0 million units, but this still was 8.5 percent below
the first-quarter average.
Retail sales excluding autos and mainly nonconsumer items increased
1.0 percent in May, following a 0.3 percent decline in April, and were
0.4 percent above their monthly average in the first quarter. Spending
for both apparel and general merchandise strengthened in May, probably
in response to widespread sales promotions. Spending for furniture and
appliances--often related to housing market developments--declined 0.7
percent to a current dollar level 3.7 percent below a year earlier.
Business Fixed Investment
Fixed capital spending declined, on balance, in April and there were
indications of further deterioration in the coming months. Shipments of
nondefense capital goods in April and May averaged about 3 percent less
than in the first quarter. While part of this decline was offset by
increased purchases of new cars, sales of heavyweight trucks in the two
months dropped to nearly 20 percent below the already depressed first
quarter monthly average. In the structures category, nonresidential
construction rose only slightly in April; drilling footage of oil and gas
wells reportedly rose in April and May, but these data tend to lag behind
the industrial production index drilling figure, which has declined in
recent months.
Near-term commitments data suggest further weakness in the second
half of 1982. Contracts and orders for plant and equipment, a leading
indicator of fixed capital spending, fell 6 percent in April, following
large declines in the two preceding quarters. Orders for nondefense

capital goods fell 4.7 percent in May, following a 2.8 percent drop in
April. Permits for nonresidential construction plunged over 25 percent
in April, while contracts for nonresidential construction dropped about
12 percent.
In addition to these sector-specific indicators, the most recent
Commerce department survey of plant and equipment spending indicated
that business plans to increase capital spending only 2.2 percent in
1982. This represents a downward revision of more than 5 percentage
points from the increase shown by the February survey, and is lower than
the 3.9 percent rise reported by McGraw-Hill for a survey taken recently.
Housing
Residential construction activity has trended up since last fall,
but it has not yet demonstrated a broad and sustained recovery. Housing
starts increased to a 1.1 million annual rate in May, exceeding the 1
million unit rate for the first time in 9 months. However, most of the
May increase was in the volatile multifamily sector. Multifamily activity
has been aided by increased demand in the rental market and an upsurge
in the share of condominiums in new homebuilding, but the May increase
of nearly 50 percent might have been an aberration. Single-family starts
rose 9 percent, in contrast.
Long-term prospects for single-family homebuilding are dependent
on sales; these have yet to show any noticeable reaction to the decline
in mortgage commitment rates since last autumn or to the continued spread
of innovative financing techniques. According to preliminary data, new
house sales declined in April to the lowest level of the current

downswing. The continued malaise in real estate markets is reflected in
the University of Michigan consumer survey for May in which indexes of
respondents' attitudes on homebuying remained just slightly above the
record lows registered last fall.
Inventory Investment
Incoming data show that, except for domestic autos, business inven-
tory liquidation generally slowed in March and April as attempts to trim
inventories were hampered by sluggish shipments and sales. In constant-
dollar terms total manufacturing and trade inventories rose at an annual
rate of $3.5 billion in April, in contrast to declines averaging at a $17
billion rate in the first quarter.
Although sharp production cutbacks have enabled manufacturers to
reduce inventories in recent months, sales have declined as well, and
inventory-sales ratios have remained high. For total manufacturing,
this ratio was 2.14 in April, only slightly below its January peak. In-
ventory overhang is particularly serious in the primary metals industry;
although stocks were reduced a little over 1 percent in April, the inven-
tory-sales ratio remained near 4.1 nearly fifty percent above "normal"
In addition, book value data indicate an $11 billion annual rate increase
in nondefense capital goods inventories in April, with much of the increase
probably unintended. April stocks in this sector in book value terms were
only slightly below their level six months earlier, when the current
inventory liquidation began.
In the wholesale trade sector, the process of liquidation was reversed
in April. After a $5 billion annual rate liquidation in the first quarter,
merchant wholesalers' inventories in constant dollars posted a $6 billion
rate accumulation in April. Again, disappointing sales were largely respon-
sible for the abrupt change. In the retail trade sector, no inventory

committees to report legislation that will increase FY1983 revenues
by $20.9 billion and change program authorizations (primarily in
entitlements) to save about $7 billion. The remaining outlay reduc-
tions that require legislative action, about $21 billion, would be
achieved in the appropriations process.

II-15
liquidation occurred in March and April, but the pickup in sales in May
suggests that retailers were able to reduce inventories, especially autos,
during that month.
Federal Government
Recent Treasury reports indicate that Federal outlays through the
first eight months of fiscal 1982 are about 11 percent higher than in the
comparable period for FY1981. A decline in Commodity Credit Corporation out-
lays in recent months has been offset by increases in defense, unemploy-
ment insurance, and interest outlays.
Receipts in the first eight months of FY1982 appear to be about 8
percent above those of the year-earlier period. Revenue growth has been
slowed by last year's tax cut and weakness in income and oil prices.
The Congress is expected to adopt a first budget resolution for
FY1983 on June 23. This resolution stipulates reducing the budget deficit
from the CBO estimate of $182 billion to $104 billion (see table).
About $21 billion of the reduction would come from new revenues, $7 billion
from defense cuts, and $20 billion from trimming other programs. The other
$28 billion of the reduction is to be derived from "management initiatives,"
the assumption of lower interest rates and less debt to be financed, and
reduced estimates of defense spendout rates.
In the resolution, tax committees are instructed to report legisla-
tion raising revenues by about $21 billion; other authorization committees
are required to reduce expenditures, mainly entitlements, by about $7
billion. These actions are scheduled to take place by August. Subse-
quently, funding for programs subject to annual appropriations will be
considered; the resolution contemplates that funding for many of these
programs will be frozen at FY1982 levels.

State and Local Government
Activity in the state and local sector continues to be weak. The
real value of construction activity fell 7.5 percent in April, more
than reversing the 4.3 percent gain that occurred in March.
Several states are raising taxes because of serious revenue problems.
For instance, Ohio is expected to levy a state income tax surcharge that
would offset about half of this year's federal tax cuts for the average
household in order to reduce a projected revenue shortfall of $1.5 billion
over the fiscal biennium ending June 1983. Several other states have
increased sales taxes and excises on gasoline and alcohol.
Employment in the state and local sector appears to have stopped
falling, at least temporarily. The preliminary estimate for May was
essentially the same as January's revised total, about 1.3 percent below
May of last year.
Prices
The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in April and then accel-
erated to 1 percent in May, led by sharp increases in the homeownership,
energy, and food components. A jump in the volatile CPI measure of house
prices accounted for a large portion of the May rise. The experimental
CPI that uses a rental equivalence measure of housing costs rose 0.6 per-
cent in May.
Food prices, rising 0.8 percent, also contributed to the accelera-
tion in the May CPI. As expected, retail meat prices posted a steep rise
as earlier increases in livestock prices began to be passed on to con-
sumers. Reduced marketings of livestock so far this year were the major

influence in these increases. Excluding meats, food prices increased
0.4 percent.
Retail gasoline prices rose 0.9 percent in the May CPI, retracing
a small part of the declines registered in preceding months. Recent
survey evidence indicates that gasoline prices have rebounded nearly 6
percent from their April low; thus, another large hike in gasoline
prices is likely to be reported for June.
In other areas, inflation continues to moderate. Excluding
food, energy, and homeownership, the CPI rose 0.4 percent in May, and
has been increasing at a 5-1/4 percent annual rate since the beginning
of the year. At the producer level, prices for capital equipment have
risen at a 3-1/4 percent annual rate over the first five months of the
year while prices of intermediate materials other than energy--a broad
measure of manufacturing input costs--have been little changed.
Wages and Labor Costs
A further deceleration in wage inflation has been evident in various
wage measures. The rate of increase in the hourly earnings index, which
approximates changes in wage rates for private nonfarm production workers,
eased to a 6-1/2 percent annual rate rise over the first five months of
1982, down from the 8-1/2 percent rise over 1981. Hourly compensation
in the nonfarm business sector, which includes non-wage supplements as
well as wages, rose at about an 8 percent annual rate in 1982-Q1--down
from 9-1/2 percent in 1981. In the white-collar category, non-wage
compensation as measured by the employment cost index fell in the first
quarter, as profit-related benefits were trimmed.

II-20
Unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector rose at a 7-1/4
percent annual rate in the first quarter, compared with an increase of
10-1/2 percent during 1981. Part of this reduction reflected an edging
up of productivity at a 1/2 percent annual rate, following a sizable
cyclical drop during the second half of 1981 and a small decline for
the year as a whole. Output per hour typically begins to rise in the
latter state of recession.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1 declined in May after the large April increase, but it strength-
ened again in early June. M2 and M3, in contrast, maintained their brisk
growth rates in May before apparently tapering off this month. All three
monetary aggregates appear likely to be above the upper bounds of their
1982 ranges in June.
The reserve positions of depository institutions eased in May and
then firmed in mid-June as the acceleration in M1 raised required reserves
relative to nonborrowed reserve supplies. The federal funds rate, after
falling into the 13-1/2 percent area in late May and early June has been
in the 14 to 14-1/2 percent range of late--still below the level prevail-
ing in mid-May. Other interest rates have increased from 1/4 to 1-1/2
percentage points, net, thus far in the intermeeting period. The term
structure of rates and the pattern of futures quotes suggest that market
participants expect further increases in rates. Market commentary focuses
on the large financing requirements of the Treasury in the second half of
the year and the possibility of an M1 surge in July as the key bearish
factors in investor thinking.
The government securities market was shaken in May and June by the
difficulties of two relatively small dealers. While these events seem
to have had some effect on the cost and availability of financing for
dealers whose credit-worthiness is not well established, the government
securities market appears to have functioned fairly normally on the
whole, absorbing the moderate volume of new debt needed by the Treasury
to cover an unusual second-quarter deficit and to maintain its cash bal-
ance over the quarter. State and local governments continued to borrow

heavily in May and June, although at a somewhat slower pace than the
record of April. Borrowing by nonfinancial business firms has continued
to be substantial--surprisingly so in light of estimated aggregate cash
flows and outlays, suggesting an accumulation of liquid assets overall and
some marked disparities in the financial fortunes of individual firms.
Residential mortgage lending probably moderated somewhat in April and
May after a sharp pickup in the first quarter, but lending was still above
the depressed pace of the fourth quarter of 1981. Outstanding consumer
installment credit continued to increase slowly in April, and a somewhat
larger increase appears likely for May.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 declined at a 2 percent annual rate in May, led by a contraction
in other checkable deposits (OCDs), which had increased at an annual rate
of about 50 percent over the preceding six months. The runoff in OCDs, on
a month-average basis, may have been at least partially associated with tax
collections, however, as OCDs have rebounded somewhat in early June. On
balance, there is as yet no definitive sign of an unwinding of the late-
1981, early-1982 bulge in OCDs. Sample data indicate that the number of
OCD accounts at commercial banks rose at an annual rate of 13 percent
between February and May--somewhat less than in the prior six months, but
enough to suggest that a small amount of funds shifted into new accounts
during this period. The size of the OCD increase since last fall, however,
indicates that a more important factor in this surge may have been a build-
up of liquid balances for precautionary reasons during a period of reces-
sionary uncertainties--although a recent survey of households undertaken

by the Survey Research Center under Board contract provides only mild sup-
port for this hypothesis.1
M2 expanded at a 10-1/4 percent annual rate in May, about the same
as in April. Growth in the nontransaction component of M2 was buoyed by
a rebound in overnight RPs, after a sharp April decline associated with
holiday-related reporting problems.2 Total growth of the other nontrans-
actions components of M2 in May was at roughly the same rate as in April.
Savings deposits again showed little change, and general purpose and
broker/dealer money market funds continued to grow moderately. Total
small time deposits expanded only fractionally faster in May than in April,
but seasonally adjusted inflows were almost evenly divided between thrifts
and banks, in contrast to the large gap favoring banks that generally has
has been evident since mid-1981. In part, the improvement in deposit growth
at thrifts resulted from inflows into accounts with an interest rate differ-
ential in their favor--the 2-1/2 year small saver certificate and the new
91-day money market certificate.3
1. The survey covered more than 4,000 households, including nearly 1,100
respondents who held an OCD account. Among the OCD account holders, only
about 20 percent perceived an increase in their OCD balances between last
fall and early this year, while about the same number of respondents per-
ceived a decrease in their OCD balances over this period. Among those
reporting increases in their OCD balances, about 30 percent of these respon-
dents indicated that the increase was at least in part attributable to pre-
cautionary motives associated with concern over income, employment, or the
state of the economy.
2. Weakness in overnight RPs in April was attributed to reporting problems
over the long Easter weekend when many RPs that would ordinarily be classi-
fied as overnight were instead reported as term RPs.
3. These accounts at thrifts attracted a combined inflow of $4 billion in
May--a small amount compared with typical inflows when a new account is
introduced. The 50/50 split with commercial banks in May also is low rela-
tive to the typical experience for accounts with interest rate differen-
tials, although it is higher than for accounts without such a differential.

The growth of M3 fell to a 10-1/2 percent annual rate in May from
12 percent in April. Shares of institution-only money market funds grew
rapidly in May following what was likely a tax-date related pause. The
growth of net large time deposits slowed slightly, but there was an
increase on a gross basis at commercial banks as core deposits weakened
and Eurodollar borrowings became less attractive in terms of cost.
Bank credit grew at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate in May, down
slightly from the pace in April, but still brisk for this stage of the
business cycle. Growth was dominated by an expansion in business loans,
which increased at an annual rate of nearly 20 percent; other types of
loans and investments either declined or expanded only moderately. Busi-
ness loans have been growing rapidly since the beginning of the year,
but the May increase was the largest to date and was accompanied by an
increase in loans at foreign branches and heavy issuance of commercial
paper by nonfinancial corporations. Data from weekly reporting banks in
early June indicate that business loans have continued to expand rapidly.
The deteriorating financial condition of business firms over the
past few years has become evident in the loan portfolios of commercial
banks. At the end of the first quarter, business loans with interest
or principal payments past due represented about 5 percent of loan port-
folios at national banks, up from 3.5 percent in the first quarter of
1979. In addition, survey data on the terms of bank lending suggest an
appreciable increase in the volume of loans with terms that have been
restructured to assist borrowers whose financial condition prevents them
from meeting the original terms of the loan. Commercial banks also have
increased sharply their volume of unused loan commitments and standby

letters of credit outstanding. By assuming these contingent claims, banks
have accommodated the needs of certain customers--primarily issuers of com-
mercial paper and tax-exempt obligations--for additional backing for their
debt.1
Business Finance
The total volume of funds raised by nonfinancial businesses picked
up rather sharply in May after a comparatively light month in April.
Although most of the increase was in loans at commercial banks and commer-
cial paper, utilities and industrial firms also raised $2.2 billion in the
public bond market, the largest amount since the record volume of last
November. Subsequently, bond volume slowed markedly in response to a run-
up in interest rates. Currently, the Board's recently offered Aaa utility
bond rate index stands at 16.45 percent, 120 basis points higher than at
the time of the last FOMC meeting.
U.S. corporations also have continued to raise large amounts of cred-
it abroad. The volume of bonds sold by U.S. firms in international markets
totaled nearly $2 billion in both April and May, up from a first-quarter
monthly average of about $1.4 billion. As in previous months, Eurobond
1. In the commercial paper market, some issuers have been able to avoid
downgradings in their ratings and others have been able to obtain new
ratings by having bank standby letters of credit behind their paper.
Although no hard data exist, dealers estimate that about 10 percent of
commercial paper is supported by letters of credit. In the tax-exempt
market, letters of credit or loan commitments are used to allow an issuer
of a municipal revenue bond to shorten the maturity of its security and
take advantage of the lower rates on shorter-term issues. If the bond
matures before the project being financed is completed, the issuer can
take down the commitment from the bank and substitute the bank financing
for the bond financing. These standby agreements between tax-exempt
issuers and commercial banks are unique in that they only provide interim
financing from the time a bond matures until the project being financed
is completed. The commercial bank is not liable for interest or
principal payments in the event of default by the tax-exempt issuer.

III-10
offerings were made by a broad range of companies, including nonfinancial
firms.
Stock prices have fallen almost without interruption since the last
FOMC meeting, with the major stock price indexes registering new lows for
1982 and beginning to approach their lowest levels since 1980. The weak-
ness in the stock market has been broadly based, although declines have
been largest for natural resource industries while stock -prices for retail
firms associated with basic consumer goods have fallen only moderately.
Reflecting the weakness in stock prices, gross equity offerings by corpora-
tions tapered off in May and June from the advanced April pace. The volume
of stock offerings in June probably will be the lowest in 16 months.
Recent information bearing on corporate financial stress suggests
that firms continue to face substantial pressure. The number of adverse
dividend actions-both reductions and suspensions-increased further in
May and June and some of these actions were taken by major corporations.
The total number of business failures through the end of May approached
10,000, about 40 percent above the number of failures over the same period
last year. Moody's and Standard and Poor's have continued to downgrade
long-term debt at a rapid pace; through the end of May, such actions
occurred at almost twice the frequency registered over the same interval
last year. In the securities market, spreads between the yields on long-
term private and U.S. Treasury bonds, and between the yields on low- and
high-quality corporate bonds, generally remain wide, but they have not
increased in recent weeks and are below the previous highs reached last
fall or in 1974-75.

III-11
Government Finance
U.S. Government Securities Market. The government securities market
became the focus of widespread attention in the intermeeting period as two
episodes involving small government securities dealers-Drysdale Government
Securities and Comark--raised the specter of a major disruption in the
financial markets.1 However, except for a temporary "flight to quality"
that led to a decline in short-term Treasury yields relative to private
yields, the immediate impacts of these incidents appear to be rather mild
and limited to smaller, lesser-known participants of the money market. The
36 primary government securities dealers generally have not experienced
difficulty in obtaining financing and appear to be willing to maintain a
large inventory of securities. In addition, the volume of secondary market
trading has been well maintained; bid-asked spreads have not widened; Trea-
sury auctions have been conducted routinely; and open market operations
have been undertaken without hindrance.
Nevertheless, market participants uniformly report that the "tone and
feel" of the market has changed since mid-May and attitudes have become
more "cautious" and "nervous." Indirect evidence--such as a decline in
reverse RPs at reporting dealers and an increase in bank loans to brokers
and dealers--seems to indicate that the availability of RP financing to
1. The first and apparently more important of these episodes occurred in
mid-May, when Drysdale Government Securities failed to pass on to the
original owners interest payments accrued on securities it had borrowed.
Chase Manhattan Bank, which claims that it acted only as an intermediary
in the transactions, reluctantly agreed to remunerate the original owners
on behalf of Drysdale, thereby averting large scale repercussions. The
second incident involved a decision by Marine Midland Bank in late May
to discontinue securities clearing operations for a client, Comark,
because of the confused state of the latter's records; Marine Midland
later resumed the clearing operations after it was satisfied that it
was incurring no immediate potential for significant loss.

small dealers has contracted. In addition, market participants have indi-
cated that rate tiering, which always existed, has become more pronounced.
Reportedly, small, less well capitalized firms are being charged about 75
basis points more than the larger dealer firms. From a longer-run perspec-
tive, a continuation of interest rate spreads this large would make it dif-
ficult for the "fringe" dealers to remain competitive and probably would
lead to a contraction in the number of government securities dealers.1
Federal Sector Financing. The combined federal deficit of $22 bil-
lion in May was financed largely by drawing down the Treasury's cash bal-
ance, and net borrowing from the public totaled only $3 billion. Despite
a surplus of $6 billion in June (resulting largely from corporate tax pay-
ments), the Treasury raised about $3 billion in new funds in an effort to
rebuild its cash balance before its heavy financing requirements in the
third quarter. Net Treasury borrowing in June has consisted entirely of
coupon issues. The Treasury raised $2-1/2 billion net in its regular bill
auctions, but net runoffs of cash management bills more than offset this
amount.
The four-year note auction planned for June 23 was rescheduled for
June 29 as a result of congressional delay in raising the debt ceiling, and
the amount of outstanding bills has been reduced in the regular bill auc-
tions on June 21 and 28. Furthermore, the Treasury remains unable to issue
1. Another likely longer-run impact of the Drysdale incident is a change
in the method of pricing repurchase agreements. The current practice is
for RPs to be priced "flat," that is, the accrued interest on the under-
lying security is not included in the principal amount of an RP loan.
It was this practice that provided Drysdale with additional capital which
it ultimately was unable to repay. The dealers' industry association has
recommended that its members begin including accrued interest in the
pricing of RPs by September 1.

III-14
bonds of more than ten years maturity because there has been no congres-
sional action on that limitation. The four-year note, to be settled
after the first of July, will raise $1.5 billion, and an additional $4
billion will be raised by auctioning seven-year notes on July 1. These
funds can be raised without encountering the debt limit but if action
on the limit is not completed by June 25, when the Senate leaves for a
recess, it will be required soon after they return on July 12.
Federally sponsored credit agencies are estimated to have borrowed
almost $9 billion in the second quarter, a considerable pick-up over the
first quarter pace. The FHLBs and FNMA each raised somewhat under $3 bil-
lion, using about two-thirds of their respective borrowing to finance
lending activity and about one-third to increasing their liquidity posi-
tions. In other agency activity, the Farm Credit Banks increased their
borrowing somewhat in the second quarter, raising slightly under $2 bil-
lion. Both FHLMC and SLMA are estimated to have borrowed about $600 mil-
lion each in the second quarter, with FHLMC's borrowing replacing a similar
amount of debt runoff in the first quarter.1
State and Local Sector. Yields on long-term, tax-exempt securities
turned up in late May and early June, after trending downward earlier in
the year. The Bond Buyer general obligation index has increased about
80 basis points since the time of the last FOMC meeting to 12.63 percent,
and the revenue index has risen a similar amount to 13.59 percent. The
increases in tax-exempt yields generally were less than in the Treasury

institutions.

market, however, and the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields declined
somewhat. A strong demand for tax-exempt securities by property/casualty
insurance companies has been reported; if this is so, it may not be sus-
tained because underwriting losses are still quite large for this indus-
try.

Gross issuance of tax-exempt bonds totaled about $5 billion in both
May and June, somewhat less than the record volume sold in April, but still
equal to the relatively high first-quarter monthly average. Local housing
authorities stepped up their offerings of mortgage revenue bonds in the
second quarter, evidently to assure that they would capture some share of
their state's quota for such bonds.1 In the short-term market, gross sales
1. Each state is limited by the Mortgage Subsidy Bond Tax Act of 1980 in
the aggregate principal amount of single-family mortgage revenue bonds that
it and its political subdivisions can issue annually through 1983, after
which the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for such a purpose will be prohib-
ited. Much of the recent mortgage revenue bond issuance was in states where
there are no programs to determine how the annual quota of such bonds is to
be allocated among localities, and it appears that local housing authorities
are rushing to issue debt before the quotas are reached.

averaged about $4-1/4 billion in the second quarter, somewhat above the
pace in the first quarter.
Mortgage Markets
Following the general pattern in other long-term markets, interest
rates on mortgages and mortgage-backed securities have moved up since the
last FOMC meeting. In the primary market, rates on conventional home mort-
gages have increased only a little, but in the more sensitive secondary
markets rates have risen by as much as 90 basis points since mid-May.
Based on limited data at commercial banks and savings and loan asso-
ciations, mortgage lending has receded after a marked pickup in the first
quarter. The annual rate of growth of real estate loans at commercial
banks averaged about 6 percent in April and May combined, compared with
7-3/4 percent in the first quarter. At savings and loan associations, the
net change in mortgage assets (including mortgage loans and mortgage-backed
securities) was $1 billion in April, down from the $2-1/4 billion monthly
average in the first quarter but above the $0.3 billion pace of the fourth
quarter of last year. Outright holdings of mortgage loans at S&Ls actually
declined in April and in five of the last seven months, but this pattern
reflected the swap programs of FHLMC and FNMA under which an institution
can exchange existing mortgages, typically bearing low rates, for more
liquid mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by these agencies. Since
last fall when the programs began, FHLMC has completed about $8 billion of
such swaps with S&Ls.1
1. After engaging in a swap with FHLMC or FNMA, an S&L could either use
the mortgage-backed security as collateral for borrowing through a repur-
chase agreement or sell it in the secondary market and reinvest the pro-
ceeds at market rates. RPs recently have been the primary source of bor-
rowing from other than the Federal Home Loan Banks, with such borrowing
increasing about $5 billion since the programs began in September. (Con't.
on p. 19.)

III-17
The volume of mortgage commitments outstanding at FNMA and FHLMC
has more than doubled over the last nine months. The marked increase
in commitment activity at FHLMC has reflected growth of its off-balance-
sheet swap program; the size of FHLMC's mortgage portfolio has changed
little during the past year. FNMA's holdings of mortgages, on the other
hand, have risen by $5.7 billion in the past year. FNMA has been partic-
ularly aggressive in the markets for adjustable-rate loans. During the
first five months of this year, it issued $4.6 billion in commitments to
buy a wide variety of ARMs, compared with $3.3 billion for fixed-rate
first and second mortgages.
Recent data on home mortgage delinquency rates and foreclosure rates
indicate that additional households are experiencing difficulty in coping
with their mortgage debts. Delinquency rate series from both the Mortgage
Bankers Association and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board climbed sharply
during the first quarter to record highs. Foreclosures started also surged
in the first quarter, according to the MBA, although they remained below
levels reached in 1973-75. The rate of foreclosures had been quite low
since the mid-1970s, even at times when delinquencies were relatively high,
in part because rapid advances in house values made other solutions to
repayment problems much preferable to foreclosure. By early 1982, however,
such alternatives as selling the house or refinancing the mortgage had been
An institution might be induced to sell the mortgage-backed security by
a recent regulatory change which allows S&Ls to amortize gradually the
capital loss on the sale of an asset rather than realize the entire loss
in the current accounting period. In addition, the sale of low-rate mort-
gage assets has been fairly common following the merger of two or more
S&Ls. Since assets are usually marked to market before these mergers are
effected, there would be no capital loss for the acquiring institution
to absorb.

rendered less attractive by weak house prices and high interest rates.
Foreclosure problems have been especially severe in the heavily industria-
lized states of the midwest; for the east north-central states, including
Indiana and Michigan, the rate of new foreclosures started is almost double
the national average.
Consumer Installment Credit
The volume of consumer installment credit outstanding expanded at an
annual rate of 4-1/4 percent in April, the second consecutive month of
growth around 4 percent. A moderate acceleration in growth may have occur-
red in May, in view of a substantial increase at GMAC resulting from its
rate-subsidy program, and preliminary data indicating expansion of commer-
cial banks and retailers together at about the April pace.
Although a 4 percent growth rate is rather low compared with the 18
percent gains of 1977-78 or the 10 percent rate in the first half of 1981,
the step-up to even this sluggish pace from virtually no growth last winter
might be another indication of a revival in consumer demand that would help
to establish an upturn in economic activity. In the postwar years, whenever
consumer credit has stopped growing or has contracted, a subsequent recovery
to the 3 to 4 percent range for at least two months generally has been fol-
lowed by a sustained period of more rapid expansion in consumer credit and
the economy in general.
Beyond the data on mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures discussed
above, evidence on financial stress in the household sector is ambiguous.
The ratio of debt repayments to disposable income is near its lowest level
in six years, and delinquency rates on installment loans have edged down
recently and currently are at low levels. On the other hand, personal

III-20
bankruptcies did rise at about a 10 percent annual rate during the first
quarter to a historical high. It may be noted, however, that the increase
in bankruptcies has slowed substantially from the explosive pace of 1980
which followed a liberalization of the National Bankruptcy Act, and the
increase in the first quarter of 1982 was less rapid than normally observed
during an economic contraction.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown by the chart on the next page, the weighted average
value of the dollar has appreciated by more than 7 percent since the
May FOMC meeting,
.The weighted-average index has now climbed to its
highest values since early in the summer of 1971, prior to the sus-
pension of the dollar's convertability into gold. On a bilateral basis,
the dollar has appreciated by 7 to 8 percent since the May FOMC meeting
against the yen, the mark, the guilder, and the Swiss franc. The
dollar has risen even more sharply against those EMS currencies that
were not revalued upward in the June 12 realignment. The pound
strengthened against all other major foreign currencies during the
period while declining by 4 percent against the dollar. The Canadian
dollar fell by 5 percent against the dollar.
The dollar's sharp appreciation over the past 5 weeks has been
partly related to the intensification of hostilities in the Middle
East, which is viewed as making the dollar more attractive as a safe
haven currency. Most of the appreciation, however, has been associated
with interest rate developments. In particular, the dollar has appre-
ciated as anticipations of a July money supply bulge have contributed
to a rise in dollar interest rates, and as longer-term dollar interest

rates have increased with the evaporation of expectations that the
budget negotiations or the Versailles Summit might create conditions
favorable to a decline in dollar interest rates.
On June 12 the European Monetary System was realigned. In terms
of EMS central rates, the French franc and Italian lira were devalued
by 5-3/4 and 2-3/4 percent, respectively, the German mark and the
Netherlands guilder were each revalued upward by 4-1/4 percent, and
the Belgian franc, the Danish krone, and the Irish pound were left
unchanged. The realignment followed several months of strong down-
ward pressures on the French franc,
Since the realignment, the French
franc has been trading near its new upper intervention limits against
the mark and the guilder,
The Belgian franc,
which had also been near its lower intervention limit prior to the
realignment, has subsequently been trading about 1 percent above
its new central rates against the mark and the guilder.
The sharp depreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S.
dollar during recent weeks has primarily reflected growing expecta-
tions that Canadian policy will ease substantially. These expecta-
tions have been fostered by announcements of a steep jump in the
Canadian unemployment rate from 9.0 percent in March to 10.2 percent
in May, and an 8 percent rate of decline in Canadian real GNP during
the first quarter. Over the longer term, the weakening of the Canadian

IV-4
dollar has also reflected the persistant differential between Canadian
and U.S. inflation rates and perhaps as well a fundamental weakening
in the Canadian balance of payments, reflecting changes in the pattern
of long-term financial flows induced in large part by Canada's National
Energy Program.
On June 14, U.S. authorities judged that exchange markets were
disorderly following the EMS realignment and the dollar's sharp appre-
ciation against all major foreign currencies. The Desk intervened
for the first time since March 1981, selling $21 million against
marks and $9 million against yen. The foreign currency purchases
were allocated evenly between Federal Reserve and Treasury accounts.
Partly in association with the rise in interest rates, the price
of gold has declined from around $340 an ounce at the time of the
May FOMC meeting to around $300 an ounce, currently. Silver prices
have dropped to roughly $5 an ounce.

IV-5
OPEC surpluses and investment flows. The OPEC current account
surplus declined sharply from an estimated $44 billion in the first half
of 1981 to $15 billion in the second half. (See table.) Recession or
destocking in many industrial countries caused OPEC oil exports to fall
about 14 percent, reflecting a 1 percent decline in oil export prices and
a 13 percent decrease in volume. After increasing only 3 percent in the
first half of 1981 from the previous half-year, the dollar value of OPEC
imports rose by 12 percent ($9 billion) in the second half of last year.
The OPEC current-account balance is believed to have been slightly
in deficit in the first half of 1982, largely because of a further decline
of $15 billion (12 percent) in oil exports. (This is expected to be fol-
lowed by a $10 billion rise in the second half of this year.) While OPEC
imports will probably continue to increase in 1982, the rate of growth is
expected to slow markedly because of moderation of domestic development
programs, notably in Nigeria, Iraq, and Libya.
In the second half of 1981 the net increase in identified OPEC
external investments amounted to $25 billion, down from the preceding
half-year but $10 billion more than the estimated current account surplus.
Apart from possible errors in the measurement of the surplus or the
identified flows themselves, this excess compared with the surplus
resulted from some combination of positive net borrowing or liquidation of
unidentified assets. The only available data on net borrowings are BIS
data, which show that OPEC countries increased their indebtedness to BIS
reporting banks by $5.3 billion in the second half of 1981 after making
$1 billion of net repayments in the first half.

In spite of the decline in the surplus and the reduction in total
identified investments flows, net new OPEC investment in the United States
increased from $7.6 billion in the first half of 1981 to $8.6 billion in
the second, equivalent to 60 percent of the surplus. For the full year
1981 OPEC investments in the United States exceeded the 1980 flow and were
equivalent to 27 percent of the surplus, more than twice as large a share
as in either of the preceding two years. One factor in the stepped-up
flow to the United States in the second half was Kuwait Oil Corp.'s pur-
chase in December 1981 of Santa Fe International, a U.S. petroleum explor-
ation and drilling company, for $2-1/2 billion. While OPEC holdings of
Treasury bills and bank liabilities were reduced in the second half of
1981, purchases of longer-term securities continued at not greatly less
than the average rate of the previous 18 months. The $16 billion of
investments in the United States in 1981 do not appear to have been prin-
cipally motivated by currency considerations, given that OPEC deposits in
the Eurodollar market appear to have increased only about $3 billion last
year following an increase of around $25 billion in 1980.
Outside the United States, almost all other identified investment
flows became smaller in the second half of last year. The largest reduc-
tions were in the flows to industrial countries other than the United
States and United Kingdom, and in the flows to the Eurocurrency market.
Notwithstanding the contraction in the second half, investments in
industrial countries other than the United States and United Kingdom
accounted for a much larger share of the surplus in 1981 (37 percent)
than in 1979-80 (14-16 percent). In strong contrast, the Eurocurrency
market took less than 20 percent of the 1981 surplus compared with
roughly 50 and 40 percent in 1979 and 1980, respectively.

IV-8
Although the OPEC current account is expected to show a deficit in
the first half of 1982, OPEC flows to the United States intensified in
the first quarter. Inflows into U.S. bank liabilities and securities
alone came to $5 billion in the first three months of this year. Iden-
tified flows to other areas in the first quarter were also positive and
totaled $1.2 billion.

IV -9
U.S. International Transactions
Wide monthly fluctuations in U.S. merchandise trade data con-
tinued in April with a small net surplus being recorded. For the
combined first four months of the year the trade deficit was $18
billion (annual rate), half the size of the fourth quarter deficit.
In April exports continued to decrease at the fairly steady
rate that began about a year ago in response to weak foreign demand
and the appreciation of the dollar. Most of the decline was in non-
agricultural items, which have decreased in volume nearly 15 percent
since the second quarter of last year. The decrease through April
was concentrated in machinery and nonfuel industrial supplies.

This drop was partly offset by an increase in the volume of petroleum
product exports, which occurred after export restrictions were lifted
last October. Exports of automotive parts to Canada also rose
slightly.
Agricultural exports accounted for only a small part of the
export decline this year. Sharp increases in wheat exports (largely
in volume to the U.S.S.R.) were offset by falling prices and volumes
of other commodities, particularly corn. As of mid-May, the U.S.S.R.
had purchased 6 million metric tons of wheat and 7.8 million metric
tons of corn. Under the Grain Agreement with the United States the
U.S.S.R. may buy 8 million metric tons each of wheat and corn this crop
year (October 1981 to September 1982), with additional purchases
possible after consultations.
The monthly movement of imports has been erratic during the
past year, but for the first four months of 1982 the value of imports
dropped 10 percent from the fourth quarter rate. About half the
decline in value was in oil imports. Oil imports averaged 4.3 million
barrels per day in April, bringing the four-month average to 15 percent
less than in the fourth quarter of 1981. Part of this reduction
reflects a stock drawdown which is unlikely to persist. Oil import
prices have dropped about $2 per barrel since January. Current

market conditions suggest that import prices will probably firm in
coming months.
Nonoil imports decreased by 8 percent (January-April/fourth
quarter of 1981) as a small price rise was offset by sizeable volume
declines. Weakening U.S. economic activity was reflected in sharp
declines in imports of a wide range of industrial supplies, capital
goods, and consumer goods. In addition, there was a big drop in sugar
imports (both price and quantity). Foreign car imports were little
changed in value; volume declined somewhat from the fourth-quarter
rate. The first year of the U.S.-Japan automotive agreement ended on
March 30; Japanese shipments to the United States were held to the
agreed-upon limit. It was reported that Japanese car shipments in
April (most of which will arrive in the United States in May) in-
creased from the level a month earlier. The value of steel imports
was about 3 percent higher this year (January-April) than in the
fourth quarter; it peaked in January and declined steadily in each
subsequent month so that by April the value of steel imports returned
to rates recorded in the first quarter of last year.
Turning to U.S. international capital transactions, net
borrowing by U.S. banking offices (including IBFs) from their own
foreign offices increased about $3 billion, on a monthly average basis,
from April to early June. Loans to U.S. nonbank residents at foreign
branches of U.S. banks reached a peak of $15 billion in late May,
as the spread between 3-month LIBOR and the prime rate widened to
nearly 200 basis points. Thereafter, they declined somewhat as LIBOR
rates increased.

During the first quarter, Eurodollar holdings of U.S. non-
bank residents increased by almost $10 billion to a level of $103.1
billion. About three-quarters of the increase was accounted for by
holdings of CDs issued by London offices of banks. CDs outstanding
at London branches of U.S. banks increased by about $5 billion in the
first quarter to a level of about $50 billion, while CDs outstanding
at their domestic offices grew sluggishly. Although the yield on
London CDs of prime U.S. banks exceeded the yield on prime domestic CDs
by about 45 basis points, on average, during the first quarter, the
perceived cost to those banks of issuing domestic CDs was about equal
to the cost of London CDs. The added cost of domestic CDs is due to-

IV -13
the higher reserve requirement on domestic CDs than on Eurodollar
borrowings and the cost of FDIC insurance of domestic deposits.
Over the past 10 years the payment of dividends by the FDIC has
limited the cost of deposit insurance to an average of less than 4
basis points, well below the nominal premium of 8-1/3 basis points.
This year, however, a number of banks are apparently computing the
cost of domestic deposits on the expectation that the FDIC will pay
little or no dividend.
International Banking Facilities (IBFs) have now been in
operation for more than six months. As of June 2, total assets of
weekly-reporting IBFs were $125.5 billion, of which $110.8 billion
were claims on unaffiliated entities. Loans account for about two-
thirds of the claims on unaffiliated entities with commercial and
industrial loans the largest component. Advances from affiliated
banking offiees account for about half of the funding of IBF claims
on unaffiliated entities; liabilities to unaffiliated foreign banks
and other IBFs account for another one third. Liabilities to foreign
residents other than foreibn banks and foreign governments and official
institutions remain under $10 billion; nearly all of these liabilities
have initial maturities of 14 days or more. IBF assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies each amount to only about $3 billion
equivalent.

These declines in G-10 holdings of
marketable Treasury issues have been largely offset by purchases by
OPEC countries, which increased their net holdings by almost $7 billion
despite the projected elimination of their current account surplus.
U.S. Current Account in the First Quarter of 1982.
The U.S. current account moved back into surplus in the first
quarter of 1982 from a deficit in the fourth quarter of last year. See
the table below. The movement into surplus resulted from a substantial
decline in the merchandise trade deficit, which more than offset a de-
cline in net direct investment receipts. Most of the change in the
merchandise trade deficit was accounted for by an 8 percent drop in
imports, which reflected weakening U.S. demand for goods. Exports also
decreased, but by a smaller amount. The reduction in net investment
income receipts was due primarily to a decrease in receipts of income
on U.S. direct investment abroad; weak economic conditions abroad, low
oil company profits, and the impact of the dollar's appreciation
against major currencies and the Mexican peso were important con-
tributing factors. Net receipts on portfolio investment increased
slightly because of a rise in the level of interest rates from the
fourth quarter to the first quarter and large increases in bank-
reported claims and liabilities.

Foreign Economic Developments. Although there are indications
that a hesitant recovery may be underway in some countries, the signs
are tentative and the pattern of recovery is not uniform. Activity in
Germany has improved slightly in recent months, but there is still no
firm evidence of a sustained recovery. In Germany, Belgium, and the
Netherlands, unemployment is at record levels. In France, the
increase in growth seen at the end of last year has not been
maintained; GNP fell slightly in the first quarter as net exports
declined, and unemployment is still above 8 percent. Prospects for an
early recovery are better in Italy as industrial production in the
latest three months has risen by about 5-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.). In
the United Kingdom, industrial production has moved ahead from
December to April by about 6 percent (s.a.a.r.). Outside Europe, the
situation is also mixed. In the first quarter, GNP in Canada fell at
almost an 8 percent rate (s.a.a.r.), and Canadian activity remains at
a low level with unemployment above 10 percent. In Japan, rising GNP
in the first quarter made up for a large fourth-quarter fall, but
activity there still remains weak. Of special concern to the Japanese
authorities was a sharp first-quarter fall in private investment.
Progress in reducing inflation has continued in most countries.
The average rate of CPI inflation for the major six industrial
economies in the latest three months is 8-1/2 percent, about 2-3/4
percentage points below the average rate of inflation in 1981. The

IV -18
recent Japanese and German performances on prices have been especially
noteworthy. In Japan, both wholesale prices and consumer prices in May
were less than 3 percent above year-previous levels, while in Germany
the CPI has been advancing at a rate of about 5 percent. In France and
Canada, however, prices have not shown signs of significant
deceleration.
As the pace of activity has slackened in recent months, trade
volumes have also grown more slowly, and current-account balances have
moved somewhat erratically. In April, the Japanese current-account
surplus widened by nearly $1 billion, (s.a.) but the cumulative surplus
for the year was only $2 billion, well below what most forecasters had
expected at the start of the year. A significant reduction of the
current-account surplus has also taken place in the first three months
of 1982 in the United Kingdom. The movement of the German current
account in recent months has been in the opposite direction, however.
The German surplus in April was $83 million, making the cumulative
deficit for 1982 less than $1 billion, which may be compared with the
deficit of almost $8 billion for all of 1981. The Canadian trade
surplus widened during the first four months to a cumulative total of
$3.9 billion (s.a.), mainly because of depressed demand in Canada.
Individual Country Notes. Recently released data show that first-
quarter GNP in Japan increased at a 3-1/4 percent rate (s.a.a.r.),
roughly offsetting the sharp drop of the previous quarter.

IV -22
In the two quarters taken together, however, GNP was nearly flat and
judging by other indicators of activity (including industrial
production which fell by almost 2 percent (s.a.) in April), the slump
in Japan has continued into the second quarter. May unemployment
reached 2.4 percent (s.a.), its highest level in 11 months. One
somewhat favorable sign is a marked strengthening of personal
consumption, which grew by almost 8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the January-
March period after several quarters of little or no real increase.
Government spending also made a strong contribution to growth, but
private equipment investment fell sharply (by 7 percent, s.a.a.r.), and
housing investment continued its prolonged decline. Real growth for
the fiscal year, which ended in March, reached only 2.7 percent, well
below the 4.1 percent official target. The Japanese are reported to be
preparing a new five-year plan (for 1983-1987), which will embody a
reduced forecast for real growth.
The April current account expanded to a surplus of more than $1
billion (s.a.) from a roughly balanced position in March; the
cumulative surplus through April came to less than $2 billion (s.a.).
The April increase was due to both a recovery of exports from an
unusually low March level, as well as continued stagnation of imports
related to weak activity in Japan. In early June, just before the
Versailles summit, the Japanese authorities announced a package of
measures aimed at alleviating trade frictions; the measures included
reductions in tariffs, expansion of quotas, and easing of import

IV -23
procedures, but notably did not include any significant concessions on
farm products which have been the focus of U.S.-Japan trade frictions.
The index of industrial production in Germany rose 2 percent
(s.a.) in March, but was flat in April. The March-April level was only
1 percent above its level a year ago. GNP declined slightly in the
first quarter. The volume of orders has also declined this year to a
level in April as low as previous troughs in the current recession. In
contrast to last year, when strong foreign orders supported the total
order index, orders from abroad this year have been declining along
with domestic orders. The rate of unemployment was 7.5 percent (s.a.)
in May, which is two full percentage points above the previous post-war
peak.
The rate of consumer-price inflation has slowed considerably this
year to slightly under 3 percent (s.a.a.r.) for the cumulative increase
from December through April, compared with a 6.6 percent annual rate in
fourth quarter of 1981. The monthly rate for May was 0.6 percent
(n.s.a.), and on a year-over-year basis, the rate of inflation is now
about 5 percent. Germany's current account shows a deficit of $0.9
billion through April this year. Last year's comparable figure was a
deficit of $4.4 billion.
The Bundesbank has maintained the cautious easing of its monetary
policy. April was the third successive month in which Central Bank
Money stood slightly above the upper limit of this year's target range.
In May, the CBM level returned to a point slightly below the upper

IV -24
limit. Effective May 7, the Special Lombard facility was shut down,
and the Bundesbank returned to its regular Lombard system at a Lombard
rate of 9 percent. On June 16, the Bundesbank provided additional
liquidity by expanding the banks' rediscount quota by DM5 billion.
In the United Kingdom, the revival of economic activity has
continued at a modest pace. The increases in industrial production
(s.a.) recorded in March and April raised the level of production to a
level some 2-3/4 percent above the cyclical trough recorded in May
1981. Real GDP in the first quarter of this year rose 2.8 percent
(s.a.a.r.) but was only about 1 percent above the cyclical trough
reached in the second quarter of last year. In April, the U.K's
twelve-month rate of consumer-price inflation was in single digits -
9-1/2 percent -- for the first time in three years, and that rate was
maintained in May. The monthly increase in May of 0.7 per cent was
much smaller than that in April which reflected increases in various
taxes and public charges.
The U.K. current account in the first quarter of this year was in
surplus by $1 billion, $1-1/2 billion below the previous quarter's
outcome and much lower than the $7 billion surplus recorded a year
earlier. The sharp swing in the current account from 1981 levels
reflects a weakening in both the U.K.'s trade account and a change in
the accounting treatment of EC budget refunds.
Preliminary data for May indicate that money supply growth is
within or below the target ranges, measured from the February base
period.

IV -25
In Canada, the rate of decline in real growth accelerated sharply
in the first quarter of this year. Real GNP fell 8 percent (s.a.a.r.)
in the first quarter, after having declined 3.4 percent and 3.6
percent, respectively, in the third and fourth quarters of last
year. There is additional evidence that the downturn in economic
activity has continued into the second quarter of this year. The rate
of unemployment in May reached a post-war high of 10.2 percent after
recording a previous high of 9.6 percent in April.
The decline in economic activity has exerted some downward
pressure on prices. Consumer price inflation, which on a year-over-
year basis reached close to 13 percent through the middle of 1981, was
11.8 percent in May. Despite the weakness in economic activity there
continues to be strong upward wage pressure. In the first quarter,
newly negotiated wage settlements without cost-of-living adjustments
rose more than 12 percent (s.a.a.r.).
The Canadian current-account balance posted a surplus of $238
million (s.a.) in the first quarter of this year after four consecutive
quarters of deficits. This surplus was the result primarily of a
cyclical strengthening of the trade surplus. In the first four months
of this year, the trade balance registered a cumulative surplus of $12
billion (a.r.), compared with $5.5 billion for the same period last
year.

IV -26
French GDP fell slightly (0.4 percent s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter, after showing fairly robust growth of almost 3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter of 1981. Both household consumption
and investment provided strength, but export growth was negative for
the second straight quarter. After showing signs of declining to
annual rates near 10 percent at the end of 1981, inflation in France in
the first five months of the year has accelerated to an average rate of
some 14 percent -- about the same rate of inflation as that for all of
1981. The May trade deficit was about $1/2 billion and brought the
cumulative deficit for the year to almost $5 billion.
In mid-May, the Government announced a supplemental budget in
line with the government policy of not increasing the deficit. The new
budget measure reduced the VAT rate on necessities (food) and local
business taxes and increased taxes on banks, including a first-time tax
on Credit Agricole. The budget also cancelled over FF2 billion in
lending from the Economic and Social Fund. At the same time, the
government announced an infusion of FF9 billion into the newly
nationalized enterprises. In mid-June, the authorities announced a
wage and price freeze, effective from July through October, as part of
a policy package designed to help support the exchange rate at its
post-EMS-realignment level. The authorities also said that they would
limit budget deficits in France this year and next to 3 percent of
GDP.

IV -27
The Italian economy is beginning to show some signs of recovery.
According to latest data, industrial production rose slightly in April
following an increase of 3-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter.
Recently released GDP data indicated that output rose nearly 5-3/4
percent (s.a.a.r.) in 1982-Q1, after having risen 10-3/4 percent in
1981-QIV. Also, upward pressure on prices has eased somewhat in recent
months. In May, consumer prices were about 15 percent above their
year-earlier level, compared with a 21 percent jump during the
corresponding period last year. Wholesale price inflation also has
decelerated somewhat. In the first quarter, wholesale prices advanced
at a 13.7 percent annual rate, compared with a 16.8 percent rate of
increase in the fourth quarter.
The trade deficit in March showed a deficit of about $400 million
(s.a.), making a first quarter deficit of $4 billion.
May and June have been marked with increased strike activity as
3-year contracts for more than one-half of the labor force are up for
renewal. Many of the short-term strikes are aimed at winning tax
reductions or spending increases from the government in exchange for
(Italian style) wage moderation. In early June, Confindustria, the
private employers' association, announced that it was withdrawing from
the current 7-year-old scala mobile agreement with the Italian unions.
However, the unions have not accepted this move and the final outcome
depends on negotiations between businesses and labor.

IV -28
Real activity continues to be weak in the Benelux countries.
Through the first five months of the year, unemployment in Belgium has
remained just below 11 percent (n.s.a.), after averaging about 9
percent in the same period in 1981. In the Netherlands, unemployment
rose to 12.2 percent (s.a.) in April from 11 percent in March and 10.4
percent in January. The rate of consumer price inflation fell slightly
in the Netherlands in April to 6.6 percent on a year-over-year basis
after averaging 6.9 percent in the first quarter of the year. In
Belgium, however, consumer prices accelerated further in May to 9.5
percent above the year-earlier level, as compared to 8.4 percent in
April. In both countries the authorities are trying to restrain
government spending and reduce budget deficits. The inability of the
Dutch cabinet to agree on the details of such a fiscal program led to
the resignation of the government last month.
