The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The sharp decline in economic activity early in the year apparently
has ended, but there are few indications of an upturn. Industrial produc-
tion and employment were little changed in July. Retail sales so far have
shown only a little improvement from a depressed June level, and there is
evidence of a further weakening of capital outlays in the near term. On
the positive side, housing starts rose substantially in July, and initial
claims for unemployment insurance benefits have been somewhat lower in
recent weeks. Moreover, progress continued to be made in reducing the
underlying trend in inflation, with wage increases remaining moderate.
Employment and Unemployment
Nonfarm employment was about unchanged in July, as gains in trade
and services about offset the continued contraction in the goods-producing
sector. However, manufacturing employment continued to show weakness,
falling another 90,000 in July, and mining was off 15,000. The composi-
tion of the contraction in industrial employment has shifted since the
beginning of the recession when losses were concentrated primarily in the
construction and consumer durables industries. The declines at these
industries and at their suppliers have tapered off during the last
several months while layoffs in oil- and gas-well drilling as well as
in the industry that builds drilling machinery have become particularly
large. Overall, the layoff rate appears to be slowing. Weekly claims
for unemployment insurance, a measure of layoffs and leading business
cycle indicator, have averaged 40,000 lower through late July than in
the preceding two months--although they remain at a high level. The
manufacturing workweek also has edged up slightly.

The unemployment rate climbed 0.3 percentage point to 9.8 percent
in July with most of the increase occurring among labor force entrants.
Unemployment remained high in July among adult men, reflecting the cumu-
lative job losses in the predominantly male industrial industries.
Although some adult women have continued to find employment in the still-
growing service-producing sector, their unemployment also rose in July.
While layoffs may be slowing, the prospects for rehiring appear a bit
weaker compared with earlier cyclical troughs. Only 19 percent of the
unemployed report that they are on layoff and expecting recall as compared
with 23 percent during the 1975 and 1980 recessions.
Industrial Production
Industrial production edged down 0.1 percent in July, following
declines that averaged 0.6 percent in the previous six months and that
have totaled about 10 percent since July 1981. Business equipment pro-
duction, one of the weakest sectors in recent months, dropped another
2.1 percent in July. Consumer goods output rose further, but this reflec-
ted mainly an increase in auto output. Assemblies were at an annual rate
of 6.6 million units in July, well above the sales pace for a second
month; as a result, the industry has scheduled a sharp reduction in
August assembly schedules to a 5.5 million unit rate.
Over the past year business equipment output has declined about 18
percent--substantially more than in the two preceding recessions. The
sharpest cutbacks have occurred in building and mining equipment, reflec-
ting extraordinary curtailments in oil-well drilling activity over the
past seven months. Office and computing equipment, a source of relative
strength in 1981 and early 1982, has been declining since March.

Production of manufacturing equipment, which includes items such as metal-
working and general industrial equipment, has dropped about 20 percent
over the last year--about in line with other postwar recessions.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing edged downward in July to about
69-1/2 percent. Utilization has fallen more than 10 percentage points
during the last year and is now close to its March 1975 low. The amount
of slack is especially great among producers of industrial materials.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Mainly because of the estimated $25 billion cut in tax withholding
and an $11 billion Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, disposable
personal income rose at a hefty $44-3/4 billion annual rate in July.
Wages and salaries, which account for most of the cyclical variation in
income, increased $7 billion--only slightly faster than the monthly average
rise in the first half of the year.
Consumer spending in July did not appear to show much response to
the July tax cut. Retail sales increased 1 percent, recovering only part
of a 3.3 percent June plunge. Excluding sales at automotive outlets and
those with mainly nonconsumer items, spending in July increased 1/2 per-
cent, and was slightly above the second-quarter average. Apparel and
general merchandise stores performed better than average in July, but
furniture and appliance sales were down.
Auto sales were a major factor in the swings in consumer spending
in both June and July. Unit sales of domestic cars fell sharply in June
to 4.8 million units a year, the lowest selling pace yet during the
recession, and they recovered slightly to only a 5.1 million unit rate in
July. General Motors started a new dealer incentive program in the last

part of July, and Ford followed suit in August, but sales in the first
ten days of August edged up only slightly further to a 5.3 million unit
annual rate.
Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for producers' durable equipment fell at an 8-1/2 per-
cent annual rate in the second quarter, as business purchases of motor
vehicles weakened and spending was cut back for nonelectrical machinery.
In contrast to equipment outlays, investment in structures edged up in
the second quarter, reflecting continued increases in commercial and
industrial building activity, and a reported rise in oil- and gas-well
drilling. However, the data for energy drilling reported in the national
income accounts tend to lag new activity, and the second quarter gain
reflects earlier strength. More recently, the number of rotary rigs in
operation, a series that leads reported drilling by about six months,
has been falling sharply.
Advance indicators of business fixed investment suggest further
weakness in the capital goods sector in the months ahead. Orders for
nondefense capital goods, which have been below shipments for 11 of the
past 12 months, fell further in June to a level 15 percent below shipments,
and there are indications that the strength in commercial building activity
is waning. Vacancy rates for commercial office space have risen to 7 per-
cent from 4 percent in 1980. Although this is well below the level that
accompanied the collapse in commercial building in the mid-1970s, it does
suggest that there is diminishing incentive to undertake new commercial
building projects.

Housing
New residential construction pursued its zigzag recovery through the
early summer. Total private housing starts jumped by a record 34 percent
in July to a 1.2 million unit annual rate; this rise more than reversed
the decline registered the previous month. Both starts and building per-
mits last month were well above their second-quarter average, extending
the gradual upswing that developed during the first half of the year.
From the cyclical lows of late last year housing starts had risen 11 per-
cent by the second quarter of 1982, and newly-issued permits were up 21
percent. These increases were less robust--and less broadly based by
region and type of structure--than typical during the first two quarters
of recent housing upswings.
The upsurge in house sales that usually provides the basis for in-
creased single-family starts has yet to materialize. After rising a bit
late last year, sales of new units in the second quarter of 1982 dropped
to the lowest quarterly pace since data collection began in 1963. The
market for existing houses has shown no sign of a recovery, and sales
have remained below the 2 million unit rate since last fall.
Average prices of both new and existing houses sold in June were
only 3 percent above a year earlier, even though many reported sales
prices may be overstated because they incorporate premiums for "con-
cessionary" seller financing. The rise in measured house prices has
decelerated in a period when the advance in construction costs has slowed
to 5 percent during the last four quarters from the 9 and 11 percent
recorded in the previous two years.

Multifamily housing starts more than doubled in July, after registering
the highest level in a year during the second quarter. Ownership units in
multifamily structures (condominiums and co-ops) have fared relatively well
in current markets. These units currently account for around two-fifths of
multifamily starts. Part of the recent strength in this sector is apparently
due to the increase in starts under the HUD section 8 program, which provides
rental subsidies for low-income projects. During the May to July period,
HUD reported such activity to be about double the depressed volume in the
same months of 1981. New construction under this program is being terminated
at the end of the current fiscal year, and many projects left "in the pipe-
line" will be started in the next few months.
Inventory Investment
While sharp production cutbacks have resulted in a liquidation of
most of the inventories accumulated in the second half of last year, the
rate of stock runoff slowed during the second quarter, contributing to
the rise in GNP. Moreover, with sales quite weak, stock-sales ratios in
the aggregate are still quite high. In constant dollar terms, the manu-
facturing and trade inventory-sales ratio for June was 1.74--about half-
way between the January peak of 1.80 and the prerecession level of 1.67.
Progress toward correction of inventory imbalances has been uneven.
Nondurable stocks seem to be more in line with sales than durable stocks.
Although most manufacturers have been successful in paring their stocks
through sharp production cutbacks, shipments in a few heavy industries,
particularly primary metals and nonelectrical machinery, have been so
weak that these industries have been unable to improve their positions
significantly.

As sales fell in June, retailers increased their book-value inven-
tories, returning their stocks to January levels after five consecutive
monthly declines. The June buildup was largely in autos, but most non-
auto stocks rose, particularly those at general merchandise stores.
As a result, retailers' inventory position deteriorated. The inventory-
sales ratio for retailers trade jumped to 1.42 at the end of June--not a
great deal better than its January peak of 1.46.
Wholesalers' mid-year inventories still appear to be burdensome.
By May, merchant wholesalers had liquidated only about one quarter of the
stocks they accumulated since the recession began, and book value data
for June show further worsening in their inventory position--a sizable
book-value increase accompanied by declining sales.
Federal Government
The tax cut and spending legislation that was passed last year, the
effects of the recession, and a sharp drop in spending for agriculture
price support programs by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) combined
in the second quarter to hold down the increase of both federal receipts
and expenditures measured on an NIPA basis. The federal deficit declined
slightly to $116 billion at an annual rate as expenditures increased more
slowly than receipts.
Aside from the swings in CCC, outlays continued their recent upward
trend in the second quarter. Most nondefense purchases and grant programs
remain restrained by last year's budget cuts, but increased unemployment
outlays and a cost-of-living adjustment in Civil Service pensions helped
boost total spending in the second quarter. Interest outlays also in-
creased due to a higher average effective interest rate and growth of the
national debt.

II-17
On the receipts side of the budget, revenues were constrained by
low nominal income growth and by the provision of last year's Economic
Recovery Tax Act (ERTA). The accelerated cost recovery provisions of
the bill as well as declining corporate profits have contributed to de-
clines in corporate profits tax accruals. Receipts from personal taxes
have remained about unchanged as some cuts in nonwithheld income tax pay-
ments offset slower income growth.
The second stage of the withholding reductions that implement the
personal income tax cut portion of ERTA went into effect on July 1.
Although the legislation specified a 10 percent reduction in liabilities,
calculations based on the new withholding tables suggest that the cut in
withholding was only about 8.5 percent. However, this smaller-than-
specified cut should not result in larger refunds next April since the
withholding reductions that implemented the first stage of the tax cut
on October 1, 1981, were too large--about 5.8 percent instead of the 5.0
percent specified in ERTA. For the year as a whole, withholding should
be about as contemplated in ERTA, and the tax tables that individuals
will use to compute their 1982 returns show a full 10 percent cut.
The administration released its Mid-Session Review of the 1983 budget
in late July. The Review assumes implementation of the aggregate deficit-
reducing measures in the congressional First Budget Resolution and projects
deficits of $109 billion for FY 1982 and $115 billion for FY 1983. Action
on two bills that implement the tax increases and a part of the outlay
reductions assumed in the First Budget Resolution has been completed by
House-Senate conferences, and votes on these bills are expected in both

houses later this week. A summary of these bills and of recent budget
actions leading to the Mid-Session Review is included in appendix II-A.
State and Local Government
Outlays by state and local governments continue to be weak. Pre-
liminary second quarter data show real purchases virtually unchanged
after falling at an annual rate of 1 percent in the first quarter. Contruc-
tion activity continued to drop; in real terms the cumulative decline
in new construction from January to June has been 5.1 percent.
Budget problems are still plaguing a number of states despite re-
trenchment on the spending side and numerous tax and fee increases.
Although only a few states actually expect to end fiscal year 1982 with
a deficit, reserves have declined from 4.5 percent of expenditures in
fiscal year 1981 to an estimated 1.5 percent in fiscal year 1982, according
to a survey by the National Governors Association and the National Associa-
tion of State Budget Officers. Generally, a reserve of 5 percent is con-
sidered to be a safe margin. Partly as a result of budget-balancing
measures, state and local personal taxes increased at a 6.6 percent annual
rate in the second quarter and indirect business taxes rose at a 12.2
percent annual rate.
Prices
Despite increases in the CPI of 1 percent in each of the past two
months, this year's moderation in inflation continues to be fairly broad-
based. The rapid rise in consumer prices in May and June reflected a
sharp bounceback in gasoline prices and very large increases in the CPI
measure of house prices. Excluding the volatile food, energy, and home-
ownership figures, inflation in the consumer sector since December was the

II-20
lowest half-year rate in more than four years. At the producer level,
price increases for investment goods also have slowed dramatically in
the face of deteriorating sales in the capital goods industries. More-
over, a decline in materials costs during the first half of 1982, along
with sharply reduced labor cost increases, promises further improvement
in the inflation picture.
Homeownership costs continued to boost the official CPI in June,
but the home price index has become increasingly unreliable. The CPI
home price index rose 12 percent at an annual rate in the first half of
1982, far more than the 3 percent rise indicated by more comprehensive
measures. The CPI mortgage interest rate index has remained near an
implied level of 15 percent for several months.
Food price increases in May and June were larger than in the two
preceding months, owning mainly to sharp advances in retail meat prices;
but inflation rates remained very low for consumer foods other than
meats. The spurt in meat prices appears to have lost some of its
momentum around mid-year as cattle prices plummeted in the July PPI,
while hog prices also turned down. In addition, at the farm level, grain
and soybean prices have tumbled as prospects for another good harvest
have become more certain. If maintained, declines in crop prices will
help contain cost pressures in the food sector in the coming year, but
they are also cutting deeply into farm proprietors' profits.
Retail gasoline prices increased more than 5 percent in June, but
recent surveys indicate they have since been relatively stable. Further-
more, spot prices of petroleum appear to have remained steady at levels
below the official OPEC prices.

Wages and Productivity
A broad range of measures indicate a continued deceleration in
wages during 1982-H1 in response to unemployment rates that have now
exceeded 7 percent for more than two years, as well as to the drop in
inflation. The rate of increase in the hourly earnings index, which
had slowed more than 1 percentage point during 1981, has decelerated
a further 2 percentage points to a 6.2 percent rate so far this year.
While this measure only covers the wages of production workers, the
latest quarter's data from the employment cost index show that the slow-
ing also has occurred in salary rates for white collar workers. The
broadest measure of labor costs, hourly compensation, which covers both
wages and fringes, is now rising about 1 percentage point slower than
last year.
Wage concessions, defined as any agreement significantly less than
traditional wage-setting practices, are one part of this slowing. These
concessions have now affected more than 10 percent of the unionized work-
force. While scheduled adjustments have continued to boost union wages
by more than 4 percent a year, the contribution of both new settlements
and COLAs has declined dramatically. Halfway through a heavy bargaining
year, increases in wage rates provided by new settlements have averaged
only 2.7 percent over the life of the contract (excluding COLAs); this
compares with the 7.7 percent increases these same parties received when
they last bargained almost three years ago.
A cyclical productivity rebound in the first half of 1982 also has
eased the pressure of higher compensation costs on prices. Output per

Appendix II-A
THE FEDERAL BUDGET AT MID-SESSION
The Administration released its Mid-Session Review of the budget,
required by the Budget Act of 1974, late in July. This review updated
its February budget to take into account actual economic developments
thus far in the current year, and to incorporate minor program revisions
and technical re-estimates. For 1983, the economic assumptions that
underlie the budget estimates were revised to reflect the rates of
growth of nominal and real income and the interest rates assumed by
the Congress in its First Concurrent Resolution on the budget. The
budget totals (but not individual components) also were adjusted to
reflect the aggregate amount of deficit-reducing measures in the Con-
gressional budget resolution, as these involved both slightly larger
spending reductions and larger revenue raising measures than were
assumed in the Administration's original 1983 budget proposals. Table 1
compares the deficit-reducing measures in the Administration's February
budget and in the Congressional resolution.
At about the same time that the Administration released its Mid-
Session Review, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
indicated in testimony that a preliminary review by CBO of the economic
outlook and budget prospects suggested that federal budget deficits in
fiscal years 1982 and 1983 would exceed those in the Congressional reso-
lution. Tables 2 and 3 show that a major element in the upward revi-
sions in the estimates of the deficits for these two years, by both the
Administration and CBO, has been a weaker economic outlook; forecasts
of inflation have also been lowered somewhat.
In the Mid-Session Review, the Administration emphasized that it
attached high priority to the achievement of the deficit-reducing mea-
sures contained in the Congressional budget resolution. Since the
Mid-Session review was released, House-Senate Conference committee
action has been completed on two bills that implement parts of these
measures; votes on these bills are expected in both houses of the
Congress this week. One of these bills contains the revenue-raising
measures and the reductions in entitlements under the jurisdiction of
the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees. This bill is
reported to contain provisions that reduce spending for entitlement
programs by a cumulative amount of $15.2 billion (principally medicare
and medicaid) over three years. (It would also raise outlays by
liberalizing extended unemployment compensation in high-unemployment
states.) Revenues are reported to be raised by a cumulative total of
$98.3 billion over the same period. The revenue-raising provisions do
not change the reductions in personal income tax rates enacted last
year but do scale back some of the business depreciation, investment
tax credit, and leasing provisions in the Economic Recovery Tax Act
(ERTA) of 1981.

Under the provisions of the revenue-raising bill:
o Individual income tax provisions would be tightened by
-- limitations on deductions for medical expenses and
insurance and uninsured casualty losses
-- an expanded alternative minimum tax (the add-on mini-
mum tax would be eliminated)
-- limits on contributions and benefits available under
pension plans
o Excise taxes would be increased by raising the cigarette tax
from 8 to 16 cents a pack, raising the tax on telephone ser-
vices from 1 to 3 cents for 1983-85 (after which, it would
be removed), and raising the airline ticket tax from 5 to 8
percent (plus increases in other taxes related to air travel).
o Corporate taxes would be raised by
-- reducing the depreciable value of investments by half
the amount of the investment tax credit (or reducing the
amount of the credit utilized) and cancelling the further
acceleration of depreciation scheduled to take
place in 1985 and 1986
-- limitations on leasing provisions in ERTA and expiration
of the ERTA leasing provisions entirely for property
placed in service after 1983; conventional leasing rules
would be liberalized after 1983
o Corporate tax revenues would also be raised by tightening
specialized provisions including
-- reduction by 15 percent in the value of certain tax pre-
ferences, including percentage depletion for coal and
iron ore, bad debt reserves, Domestic International
Sales Corporations, pollution control facilities, and
interest on debts used by financial institutions to
carry tax-exempt securities acquired after 1982
-- tighter limitations on the use of industrial development
bonds and disallowance of "small-issue" industrial develop-
ment bond use after 1985
-- tighter provisions pertaining to mergers and acquisitions;
-- a requirement that businesses capitalize construction
period interest and taxes for nonresidential property;
-- restrictions on the deferral of taxes on income from
longer-term contracts
-- limitations on favorable tax treatment for life insurance
companies through use of co-insurance
-- some reduction in the tax advantages to companies operat-
ing in Puerto Rico
-- tightened treatment of original issue discount bonds
II-A-2

o Tax compliance would be increased by
-- imposing a withholding tax of 10 percent on interest and
dividends; exceptions would be made for low income indi-
viduals and most elderly and for interest of less than
$150 per year from any single institution
-- stricter reporting of restaurant tips
-- acceleration of corporate tax payments within the year
when the liability is incurred
This bill also would extend the targeted jobs credit for hiring certain
hard to employ groups; the credit, which had been scheduled to expire,
would apply to individuals who begin work before 1986.
The second bill that implements a portion of the outlay reductions
contained in the Congressional budget resolution would delay cost of
living increases for federal pensioners, limit price supports for farm
products, and make further cuts in the foodstamp program. Extremely
preliminary estimates of the outlay reductions that would result from
this bill are reported to total about $13 billion over three years.
The remaining outlay reductions assumed in the Congressional
budget resolution are to be achieved by limiting annual appropriations
below current services levels, administrative management measures to
reduce costs and the lower estimates interest costs below baseline
assumptions as a result of smaller deficits to be financed and a
projected response of interest rates to the improved deficit outlook.
Congressional action on the appropriations bills is in a very early
stage.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1 was unchanged during July, and moved within the upper bound of
its 1982 growth range for the first time. Although M2 and M3 continued
to exceed targeted levels, the weakness in transactions deposits resulted
in a substantial decline in adjustment borrowing at the discount window.
The System gave further impetus to an easing of money market conditions
through three one-half percentage point cuts in the discount rate.
Federal funds, which generally traded in the neighborhood of 14-3/4
percent at the time of the last FOMC meeting, most recently have been in
the 10 percent area. Other short-term market rates have declined 3 to 5
percentage points during the intermeeting period, reaching the lowest
levels since the summer of 1980. Taxable long-term bond rates have fallen
about 1-1/2 percentage points; about one-third of the decline occurred on
August 17. The term structure of rates has assumed an extraordinarily
sharp upward slope in the maturity range under two years, evidencing market
expectations that security yields will be rising considerably in the months
ahead.
One reason for this bearish outlook is the trajectory of the federal
budget. Treasury borrowing expanded sharply in July and early August in
order to help finance a record deficit for the third quarter and to build
up cash in anticipation of another massive fourth-quarter shortfall. State
and local governments, meanwhile, have continued to borrow heavily, mainly
in the form of revenue bonds. Nonfinancial business firms appear to have
continued raising funds in roughly the same volume as in the first half of
the year, with high bond rates remaining a deterrent to long-term financing.
Residential mortgage commitment and lending activity has remained quite

weak, while consumer installment credit has continued a pattern of slow
growth.
Although the shocks of recent business and financial institution
failures appear not to have significantly disrupted credit flows on a
macro level, financial markets have been marked by a considerable unease
and volatility. Lenders have exhibited some heightened quality conscious-
ness, and risk premiums have increased in several sectors--most dramati-
cally in the commercial paper market, where the rate spread between
medium- and highest-quality paper has become the widest since 1974. In
contrast to 1974, however, there has not been a general closing of the
commercial paper or bond markets to lower-rated borrowers, and on the whole
non-price rationing by lenders has been limited to a fairly selective cul-
ling of questionable credits.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
During July, M1 was unchanged on a monthly average basis, after two
months of slight decline.1 Outflows from demand deposits slowed in July,
but currency growth decelerated from the pace of previous months and OCDs
declined slightly. The recent behavior of M1, given the sharp drop in
short-term interest rates, suggests a continued unwinding of the bulge in
M1 demand that occurred during late 1981 and early 1982.
Concurrent with the weakening in OCDs, there has been a renewed run-
off in regular savings deposits. Passbook balances at all depository
1. The monetary aggregates table also includes an alternative seasonally
adjusted M1 now being published on an experimental basis. This alterna-
tive measure, which exhibits somewhat smoother month-to-month changes,
registered slower growth than the current M1 series in the first few
months of 1982. Since April, however, the alternative measure has
tended to grow more rapidly, despite a 3-3/4 percent rate of decline in
July.

III-4
institutions fell at an annual rate of more than 20 percent in July, the
first substantial outflow since last October. However, a sharp increase
in small-denomination time deposits during July more than offset the weak-
ness in savings balances and largely accounted for a pickup in the nontrans-
actions component of M2. As a result, M2 growth accelerated to a 9-1/4
percent annual rate in July--just a shade below the pace of the first half.1
The surge in small time deposits was evident at both commercial banks
and thrifts, but commercial banks gained a proportionately larger share,
likely owing to their relatively better performance with 6-month MMCs. Con-
cerns about the health of thrift institutions may have allowed banks to com-
pete more favorably for these accounts, on which there is no rate differen-
tial. General purpose and broker/dealer MMMF shares picked up sharply
towards the end of July and in early August, as their yields became attrac-
tive relative to more rapidly declining short-term market rates.
M3 growth accelerated to a 12-1/2 percent annual rate in July. In
addition to more rapid expansion in its M2 component, this increase reflec-
ted continued heavy sales of large CDs and sharply larger inflows into insti-
tution-only MMMFs. In July, rate spreads favored increased use by banks of
domestic CDs to fund assets booked at affiliated offices abroad. In addi-
tion, some institutions reported seeking CD funds as a precaution against
1. M2 velocity likely will fall again in the current quarter, marking the
fourth consecutive quarterly decline. Substantial declines in M2 velo-
city of the sort seen in the past year have occurred earlier in the
postwar era only during periods of reintermediation when interest rates
fell below Regulation Q ceilings; however, the present composition of M2
suggests that this pattern may be much less important now. The emergence
of high real rates and the prevailing economic uncertainties may have
caused households to shift their portfolios toward financial assets in
general, and especially toward the relatively safe short-term assets
encompassed by M2.

possible liquidity problems in the wake of recent bank and security firm
failures.
A bulge in risk premiums that developed on CDs relative to Treasury
bills in late June and early July--around the time of the Penn Square fail-
ure--had largely disappeared prior to the Lombard-Wall bankruptcy announce-
ments on August 12 when it widened again, but only briefly.1 In recent
weeks liquidity problems have not required an unusual amount of discount
window use. Just a few of the thrift institutions that were uninsured
depositors in Penn Square have borrowed, and only Abilene National Bank,
which was merged with another bank on August 6 because of its own loan
problems, has required quantitatively significant assistance. Adjustment
plus seasonal borrowing has averaged about $400 million (daily average
basis) thus far in August, versus $1.1 billion in the month of June.
Bank credit grew at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in July, slightly
faster than in June but below the pace of earlier months. The rise
involved a moderate increase in holdings of U.S. Treasury securities at
both large and small banks--with growth at large banks primarily in trad-
ing accounts--together with stepped up growth in consumer loans and the
first expansion in security loans since March. The increase in consumer
1. However, some of the specific banks that had large loan losses associ-
ated with the Penn Square and Lombard-Wall failures reportedly still are
facing resistance in selling short-term liabilities, most notably Continen-
tal Illinois and, more recently, Chase Manhattan. In recent weeks, second-
ary market quotes on Continental's CDs have ranged from 50 to as much as
170 basis points above CD rates paid by top tier banks. As alternatives
to the CD market as a source of funds, Continental has tapped the Eurodollar
and the federal funds markets, and has obtained money through its Edge Act
subsidiary. Rates on Chase's CDs reportedly have been as much as 40 to 50
basis points above those of other top tier banks, in response to their
heavy issuance of CDs and also to reports of their losses related to the
Penn Square and Lombard-Wall problems.

loans was the largest since last December. In contrast, real estate loans
showed almost no growth, and the pace of business lending slowed.
Business Finance
Nonfinancial firms continued to raise a substantial amount of funds
in credit markets during July, with the monthly pace probably approximating
the average for the first half of the year. Most borrowing continued to be
concentrated in shorter maturities, but--as open market yields fell sharply
below the bank prime rate--there was a shift away from domestic banking
offices toward commercial paper and to a lesser degree foreign branches.
The prime rate has fallen from 16-1/2 to 14 percent; even so, it remains
at a large spread over commercial paper and CD rates.
Corporate bond issuance picked up somewhat in July; there are indi-
cations of another spurt currently in response to the recent market rally.
Public offerings reached almost $3 billion in July, on a seasonally adjusted
basis. Most of this volume comprised issues by industrial and financial
concerns, and $1.1 billion of it was in the form of extendable notes.1
Much of the conventional longer maturity bond financing was undertaken by
electric utilities. Although the monthly volume of Eurobond offerings by
U.S. corporations in June and July was substantially less than during ear-
lier months in 1982, the pace of such financings appears to have quickened
in recent weeks.
Stock prices declined in July and early August, but a large portion
of this drop was offset by the spectacular August 17 market rally. Despite
1. The interest rate on an extendable note is reset periodically--most com-
monly every 1 to 3 years--and investors have a put option on those occasions.
If the maturities of such notes are categorized by the length of the exten-
sion intervals, then about two-thirds of public bond issues in July had
maturities of less than five years.

July's lower share prices, stock issuance rose last month on a seasonally
adjusted basis, mainly because of increased offerings by utilities and
financial concerns. Banks in particular have been making a considerable
effort to raise primary capital over recent months, and two large issues
of preferred bank stock accounted for a substantial share of the financial
stock offerings.
New stock issues related to the retirement of outstanding bonds--
transactions that reduce debt-equity ratios and that are known as debt-
equity swaps--averaged just under $300 million per month during the first
half of the year. Most of these transactions were undertaken by industrial
firms. Preliminary data for July indicate a considerable slowing in such
transactions, which became less attractive because of the rise in bond
prices and the general decline in stock prices then. Some other companies
have removed debt from their balance sheets by "defeasance"--effectively
offsetting the liabilities with binding commitments of cash or other assets.
Both of these methods permit firms to boost current reported earnings by
realizing a capital gain on their outstanding deeply discounted debt, but
the transactions produce a smaller tax liability than would be incurred by
a straight liquidation of debt.
Ouality rate spreads on corporate security yields have exhibited mixed
movements against a backdrop of numerous dividend reductions and omissions,
adverse rating actions, and business failures. The rate spread between
high- and medium-quality commercial paper has widened substantially since
the last FOMC meeting, reaching 163 basis points, but the quality spread
in corporate bond yields has not widened and lower-rated issuers still
appear to have access to the primary market.

Government Finance
Federal Sector. The staff estimates the combined federal budget
deficit at $44.6 billion in the current quarter, a record amount for a
third quarter. The Treasury intends to borrow about $50.5 billion in the
market during this quarter in order to fund the deficit and to build up
its cash balance in anticipation of another large deficit in the fourth
quarter. The staff expects the Treasury to borrow still more heavily in
the market during the October-December period; action on the debt ceiling
will be required since the temporary increase in the ceiling to $1.1 tril-
lion, enacted late in June, will expire on September 30.
Thus far this quarter, the Treasury has raised $32.6 billion through
marketable borrowing. The Treasury has had to rely on sales of bills and
notes because the Congress has not yet raised the statutory limit on bonds
with coupons exceeding 4-1/4 percent.1 The Treasury has raised about $10.4
billion by enlarging its regular bill auctions, $4.5 billion through the
sale of cash management bills that will mature in September, and $17.7 bil-
lion in note auctions including the mid-quarter refunding.2
Primary dealers have provided strong support to the market since mid-
year, as their overall positions in Treasury securities have registered a
1. Legislation to raise the limit from $70 billion to $110 billion is
attached to the tax bill, now moving toward final consideration in both
the House and the Senate.
2. Treasury Investment Growth Receipts (TIGRs)--a novel instrument intro-
duced by Merrill Lynch--could enhance the demand for long-term Treasury
securities. The new certificates represent participation in a trust of
$500 million of 14 percent 30-year Treasury bonds due in 2011; they com-
bine the features of zero-coupon bonds with the credit quality of U.S.
Treasury securities. The TIGRs will be sold in two forms--serial issues
corresponding to the coupon interest on the Treasury bonds through 2006,
and a 30-year callable issue corresponding to the last 10 interest pay-
ments and the principal of the Treasury bonds.

III-12
$9.7 billion swing, from a small net short to a large net long (including
cash, futures, and forwards) through August 16. The Lombard-Wall failure
has heightened concerns about the RP market; besides highlighting again
the need for attention to credit risks, it has also brought to the fore
long-standing questions about the legal aspects of the RP contract. Mar-
ket reports suggest that the tiering that emerged in the RP market after
the Drysdale failure has persisted, and that firms without strong capital
positions are finding themselves cut from the lists of former RP creditors.
Borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies totaled $9 billion
in the second quarter, and about $4 billion is estimated for July. FNMA
borrowing picked up to $2.9 billion in July in order to finance large net
purchases of mortgages and to build liquidity. In contrast, FHLBank bor-
rowing fell off to $600 million as an increase in deposit flows at thrifts
reduced their demands for advances.
State and Local Sector. Yields in the municipal bond market generally
have moved down about three-quarters of a percentage point since the last
FOMC meeting. Yields on revenue bonds have declined by less than those on
general obligation bonds, perhaps owing to the unusually large quantity of
revenue bonds sold last month. As a result, the spread between yields on
such bonds and on general obligations widened to about 100 basis points in
July, compared with 65 to 80 basis points during most of the first half of
the year.
Although the total volume of state and local government borrowing in
July receded from the record second-quarter pace, gross issuance of tax-
exempt bonds was $5.6 billion (seasonally adjusted), up slightly from the
second-quarter volume, with revenue securities accounting for an unusually

III-13
large 80 percent of the total volume. Mortgage revenue bonds--proceeds
from which are primarily intended to finance single-family housing--totaled
about $2.5 billion in July, the largest monthly volume since December 1980.1

Demand for long-term municipal bonds by institutional investors has
remained relatively weak. Individuals have been the major purchasers of
new municipal bonds, partly through investments in shares of unit investment
trusts (UITs), and of municipal notes through tax-exempt money market funds.
Sales of UITs in July were at a record $1.1 billion, and UIT assets have
increased 25 percent thus far in 1982 to about $31 billion at the end of
1. Issuance of mortgage bonds likely was stimulated in part by falling inter-
est rates which increase the attractiveness of mortgages provided through
these programs. In addition, volume probably was boosted by a Treasury rul-
ing that in effect increased the arbitrage income bond issuers can earn, as
well as by an IRS announcement that removed the uncertainty about the maxi-
mum amount of such bonds that can be issued in each state this year under
existing law.

III-14
last month. Tax-exempt money market funds have grown even more rapidly dur-
ing 1982 to about $9 billion in assets--almost double the end-of-1981 total.
These funds have absorbed a major share of the growing volume of tax-exempt
commercial paper (currently about $1.7 billion outstanding).
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates in the primary and secondary mortgage market have fallen
since early July to the lowest levels of the year. In the primary market for
long-term loans, the average contract rate on new commitments at S&Ls for 80
percent, fixed-rate level-payment conventional home mortgages has declined
more than 40 basis points, to 16.44 percent. As discounts dwindled on mort-
gages underwritten by the federal government, the administration reduced
rate ceilings on standard FHA and VA home mortgages by one-half percentage
point to 15 percent, effective August 9.
With nontraditional financing techniques still prevalent in the pri-
mary market, interest rates paid at closing by many homebuyers appear to
have remained substantially below rates quoted on new commitments for con-
ventional fixed-rate mortgages.1 At major institutional lenders, the con-
tract rate on all types of conventional first home mortgages closed in
early July averaged 15 percent, more than 180 basis points below the aver-
age rate then prevailing on new commitments at S&Ls for conventional fixed-
rate home mortgages.2
1. Many home sellers have continued to provide financing at concessionary
rates, likely in return for a premium incorporated in home sale prices. The
latest (April) survey by the National Association of Realtors estimated
that 70 percent of sales of existing homes involved one or more creative
financing techniques, with interest rates on loan assumptions, "buydowns,"
and seller "takebacks" typically 3 to 4 percentage points below the market.
2. This differential continues to reflect inclusion in the average closing
rate of below-market-rate loans such as those with "blended" rates and loans
financed with mortgage revenue bonds. Moreover, the closing rate itself
(continued on page III-15)

III-15
Mortgage commitment and lending activity at depository institutions
has remained weak. At commercial banks, growth of real estate loans slowed
almost to a halt in July, and new mortgage commitments made by savings and
loan associations during June edged up only slightly. Growth in S&L hold-
ings of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in June remained at
less than one-third the average monthly increase during the first quarter.
Both FNMA and FHLMC continue to expand existing programs and to intro-
duce new arrangements to accommodate innovations in the primary mortgage
markets. FNMA recently announced that, beginning September 1, FHA and VA
mortgages will be eligible for its swap program, which allows an institu-
tion to exchange existing mortgages--typically bearing low rates--for more
liquid mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the agency. FNMA also has
begun to issue commitments to purchase graduated-equity home mortgages
(GEMs) for its own portfolio and has announced plans to issue and guarantee
securities backed by GEMs, beginning September 1.1 FHLMC has inaugurated
a program to issue and guarantee GEM participation certificates, with
Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers cooperating in the origination of the
mortgages and the sale of the certificates. FNMA and FHLMC expect the
shorter maturity and more rapid cash flow of GEMs to attract investors who
wish to avoid very long-term investments in an environment of volatile
interest rates.
somewhat overstates the average rate paid by borrowers to the extent that
it incorporates the full contract rate on "buydowns," including the portion
of the contract rate paid by the home seller as well as that part paid by
the borrower.
1. GEMs are fixed-rate mortgages involving scheduled gradual increases in
monthly payments, with increases applied entirely to reduction of principal.
Compared with an otherwise equivalent 25- to 30-year conventional fixed-rate
loan, a GEM loan substantially reduces the total interest cost to the home-
owner and enables homebuyers to own their homes outright sooner.

Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding expanded in June at about
the same 5 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate as in May. For the
full second quarter, consumer credit grew at a 4-3/4 percent rate, up from
1-3/4 percent in the first quarter. Indications of a rebound in credit
growth at banks suggest that the moderate overall advance continued into
July despite the likelihood of weaker expansion at auto finance companies
and retail stores.
The revolving credit component advanced at a 10 percent rate in June,
the third consecutive month of expansion at that pace. Stepped-up increases
of such credit at commercial banks and retailers since February have out-
weighed sluggishness in gasoline-card credit that has reflected recent
actions taken by several gasoline companies to discourage or preclude the
use of gasoline credit cards.
Delinquency rates on consumer installment loans at commercial banks
dropped during the second quarter to their lowest level in nine years. A
steady decline in this series since the third quarter of 1980 has been
interrupted only briefly by a small rise in the fourth quarter of 1981.
Delinquencies usually climb during a recession, but this pattern has not
been repeated in 1981-82, in large part because banks did not relax their
tightened credit standards following the 1980 recession. Similarly, the
delinquency rate on auto loans at major finance companies fell in the
second quarter to its lowest level since the series was begun in 1966.
Personal bankruptcies also declined fairly sharply in the second quarter,
when the number of cases filed was 7 percent below the peak first-quarter
total.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown in the upper panel of the chart on the next page,
the weighted average value of the dollar has shown substantial vari-
ability during the last several weeks but has remained almost unchanged
on balance since the last FOMC meeting. While the direction of exchange
rate changes closely paralleled interest rate movements on a daily
basis, overall there has been a substantial relative decline in dollar
interest rates. The strength of the dollar in spite of declining
interest rate differentials apparently reflected its attractiveness as
a safe haven currency in the face of market anxieties over the bank-
ruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano in Italy and the insolvency of the German
firm AEG Telefunken, as well as the Mexican financial crisis.
As shown in the lower panel of the chart, the differential
between rates on U.S. CD's and average foreign interbank rates declined
by about 500 basis points and turned negative for the first time since
November 1981. Eurodollar interest rates on maturities up to 1 year
fell by 2-1/2 to 4 percentage points during July, and have fallen
an additional 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points following the recent dis-
count rate cut. Several countries, in particular the United Kingdom,
Switzerland, Canada, Belgium, and France, have experienced declines
in short term rates of 1 to 2 percentage points during the last six
weeks, while no interest rate changes have occurred in Japan and
Germany.

.The Desk intervened on one occasion,
purchasing $6 million equivalent of yen and $5 million equivalent
of marks.
In early August, the Mexican government substantially raised
administered prices on certain foods and gasoline, and this was quickly
followed by labor union demands for increased wages. Conversions
from dollars to pesos accelerated and the Bank of Mexico found it
increasingly difficult to support the prevailing level of the peso.
.On August 5 the Mexican central bank announced
a new two-tier exchange rate system for the peso. A preferential
rate was established for most food and other "priority" imports,
and some private debt servicing. The preferential rate was set at
49 pesos per dollar (the previous market rate) and is expected to

IV-4
be depreciated gradually. The free market peso fell sharply following
the announcement, with prohibitive bid/asked spreads and virtually
no trading for several days. The establishment of the two-tier
exchange rate system failed to stop the drain on Mexico's foreign
exchange reserves, as rumors that controls would soon be instituted
were widespread, causing liquidation of dollar balances at Mexican
banks. Consequently, the Mexican authorities announced on August 12
that foreign exchange markets in Mexico were being closed, that banks
were prohibited from transferring Mexican dollar accounts out of the
country, and that withdrawals from Mexican dollar accounts could
only be taken in pesos. In U.S. markets, the peso is trading at about
85 per dollar, representing a 40 percent depreciation during August
and 70 percent since the beginning of 1982. Since formal exchange
markets remain closed in Mexico, street trading has reportedly taken
place in excess of 100 pesos per dollar. On August 17 the Mexican
Finance Minister announced that $3.5 billion of foreign credits had
been obtained or were in advanced stages of finalizing, including
$1 billion from advance oil sales to the United States, $1.5
billion from western central banks, and $1 billion from the Commodity
Credit Corporation.

U.S. Merchandise Trade. In June the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit was marginally greater than in May but the deficit for the
second quarter as a whole ($20 billion at annual rate) was slightly
smaller than in the first quarter. Exports in the second quarter were
about unchanged from low first quarter levels and imports declined
somewhat.
The value of agricultural exports increased slightly in the
second quarter, with the volume of shipments up by 4 percent (primarily
corn and soybeans) while the average export prices of most major
commodities continued to decline in response to large supplies and
moderate demand.

Nonagricultural exports were little changed in value or volume
between the first and second quarters. In response to weak foreign
demand, lower primary commodity prices, and the decreasing competitive-
ness of U.S. goods as the dollar appreciated, various categories of
exports declined (civilian aircraft, metallurgical coal, construction
machinery) or continued at low first-quarter levels (other industrial
materials,particularly metals, paper, textiles). However, several items
increased strongly in the second quarter, particularly computers and
parts, and electrical/electronic machinery and parts.
The decline in imports in the second quarter was primarily the
result of a drop in oil imports. The volume of oil imports dropped
10 percent from first quarter rates to the lowest level since the
second quarter of 1972 as U.S. demand slackened and as domestic stocks
were drawn down from high levels. The average oil import price declined
about $1.65 per barrel to average $30.53 per barrel. Spot prices for both
crude and products slipped to about $3 per barrel below official prices
of most OPEC countries. OPEC failed to agree on a new pricing and out-
put structure at its meeting on July 9-10.
Despite the sluggishness of U.S. economic activity, nonoil imports
turned up in the second quarter. Volume increases were particularly

strong in foods and machinery (both from low first quarter rates).
Automotive imports from Japan decreased slightly while imports from
Germany and other countries rose somewhat from first quarter levels.
Partly offsetting these changes were declines in imports of consumer
goods and of industrial supplies (particularly steel and steel making
materials, other metals and natural gas). While total steel imports
decreased somewhat in the second quarter,it appears that imports from
Common Market countries rose while imports from Japan and other
countries declined.

dollar borrowing by one U.S. money center bank to offset runoffs of
its domestic CDs was exceeded by net outflows from both U.S. and foreign-
chartered banks. The surge in net advances may have been prompted by
unusually high spreads between the cost of issuing domestic CDs and
returns available on placements in the Eurodollar interbank markets.
The functioning of the international interbank markets has been little
affected by either the Banco Ambrosiano scandal or the rumors of size-
able loan losses for Canadian and German banks. In particular, U.S.
regional banks, which in the aggregate are large net placers of funds in
those markets, have not reduced advances to their foreign branches
over the last two months.
The Eurodollar CD market also continued to function smoothly.
At the end of July Continental Illinois was removed from the list of
prime names in the secondary market for Eurodollar CDs, but reportedly
no further tiering of rates paid by other U.S. issuers of Eurodollar
CDs has developed. There has been no evidence that investors have
run off Eurodollar CDs in a flight to quality. Yields on prime Euro-
dollar CDs have remained at a level of 30 to 60 basis points above prime
domestic CDs. Money-market mutual funds, which hold about 40 percent
of total Eurodollar CDs outstanding at London branches of U.S. banks,
have not reduced their holdings of such obligations.
Loans to U.S. nonbank residents at foreign branches of U.S.
banks have risen sharply over recent weeks as the LIBOR rate fell
sharply relative to the prime rate -- see line 3 in the table above.
These loans are concentrated at a small number of banks, mostly New
York banks, that follow a practice of booking LIBOR-priced loans in the

IV -9
Caribbean and booking prime-priced loans at the head office. As the
customers of these banks exercise their options under credit arrange-
ments to switch pricing formulas,the booking location is also shifted.
During June, as the differential between the prime rate and the 3-month
LIBOR narrowed by 200 basis points, branch loans fell. This decline
has now been reversed as the differential between LIBOR and prime
interest rates reopened.
Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbank residents continued to grow
at a rapid pace between March and May (most recent data available). In
the first five months of the year such holdings increased by $20 billion
to a level of $113 billion. In the March-May period holdings of Euro-
dollar CDs issued by London Banking offices increased particularly
rapidly, despite a cessation of the growth of holdings by money-market
mutual funds.

Foreign Economic Developments. There have been no clear signs in
any foreign industrial economy that a recovery is underway. However in
the United Kingdom, where industrial production (s.a.) increased .6 per-
cent in the second quarter, hut was negative in June, the slowdown in
activity may have bottomed out. Industrial production (s,a.) fell in
Italy, Germany and Japan in the second quarter of this year. In Canada,
industrial production, though it rose in May, is still below its May
1977 level.
Although inflation abroad has eased substantially since last year,
the progress has not been uniform. The first-half rate of increase in
the CPI for the 10 foreign industrial countries was about 8.5 percent,
compared with 10.5 percent for the first half of 1981. In Canada and
France the rate of consumer price inflation in the second quarter was
virtually unchanged from the high rates reached in the second quarter of
last year. In the other major industrial countries there have been sub-
stantial declines.
The sluggish state of economic activity abroad has been reflected
in an improvement in current-account positions in some of the major
foreign industrial countries this year relative to 1981. In Japan, the
current-account surplus (s.a.) for the first half of this year was $3-1/2
billion as compared with $1 billion for the same period last year. The
first-half surplus, however, was below many earlier forecasts. In Ger-
many, the current account (s.a.) showed a small surplus in the second
quarter. For the first half of this year the current-account deficit
was $0.4 billion as compared with $6.7 billion for the same period last
year. Weak domestic demand is the primary factor behind the sharp rise

IV -12
in Canada's trade surplus in the first half of this year. In France
and the United Kingdom, however, both the trade and current-account po-
sitions showed some deterioration.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, the authorities have contin-
ued to struggle with the effects of weak demand in both domestic and
external sectors. Although industrial production in June recovered the
ground lost in May's sharp drop, the average level for the second quar-
ter was still 7 percent (s.a.a.r.) below the first-quarter level. The
mid-July assessment of the economy by the Japanese Economic Planning
Agency (EPA) noted recent increases in inventories and deterioration of
labor-market conditions as particularly troubling developments that may
endanger a hoped-for recovery of domestic demand later this year. (In
June, unemployment reached 2,5 percent (s.a.), its highest level in 16
years.) Stagnation in production and shipments of manufactured goods
was attributed primarily to reduced export demand.
The authorities appear to be stymied in the use of conventional
demand-management tools to stimulate domestic demand by concern over
budget deficits and weakness of the yen. Recently released budget fig-
ures for the FY 1981 (which ended in March) revealed a revenue short-
fall of some ¥3 trillion (about $11 billion equivalent); some of this
shortfall has been financed by controversial stop-gap measures includ-
ing sales of long-term government bonds from the Ministry of Finance
debt consolidation fund directly to the Bank of Japan. Although the
Bank of Japan has guided short-term interest rates upward in recent
months (by a total of about 80 basis points) and recent declines in
U.S. short rates have closed the short-term rate differential to about

IV -13
3-1/2 percentage points, the yen has failed to strengthen.
Price developments in Japan continue to be favorable. The CPI
fell in July by a full percentage point, and in recent months consumer
prices have been moving ahead at only slightly above a 2 percent annual
rate. Wholesale-price inflation has been even more moderate at about 1
percent (a.r.).
The June trade surplus was virtually unchanged from that of May
at about $1.7 billion (s.a.), but the current-account surplus widened
in June by about $500 million to $1 billion. An important element in
the June increase was improved net investment earnings that are related
to recent long-term capital outflows from Japan. These capital outflows
continued strongly in June as Japanese purchases of foreign securities
and non-residents' sales of Japanese securities together produced a net
outflow of almost $900 million.
Industrial production in Germany declined again in June, the third
consecutive monthly decline. The second-quarter average of the index
matches previous low points of the current recession. The rate of unem-
ployment has continued to rise through July, when it reached 7.8 percent
(s.a.). Recent survey data suggest that views on business conditions
have once more taken a turn for the worse. Corporate insolvencies dur-
ing the first half of this year were 50 percent higher than in the com-
parable period last year.
The rate of consumer-price inflation, which earlier this year had
been slowing, has accelerated again in the summer months averaging over
7 percent (a.r.) for the June-July period.
The current account (s.a.) showed a small deficit in June, after

IV -14
small surpluses in the preceding three months. For the first half of
this year, the cumulative deficit was only $0.6 billion compared to a
deficit of $6.7 billion in the first half of last year.
The rate of growth of Central Bank Money continued in June near
the upper limit of the Bundesbank's 4 to 7 percent target range.
This year's negotiations among the government coalition partners
about the 1983 federal budget were concluded in July. The new budget
provides for only 2 percent growth in real spending, compared with 5.5
percent in 1982, and new borrowing of DM28.5 billion, compared with
DM34 billion in 1982. The budget contains large cuts in spending on
social services such as unemployment benefits and pensions. Defense
spending is budgeted to rise by 4.1 percent. The underlying assumption
of 3 percent real GNP growth is considered optimistic by private fore-
casters.
In the United Kingdom, industrial production fell in June by 1-1/2
percent (s.a.) after a percent rise in May. The June industrial pro-
duction level was the same as that recorded in June 1981. Real GDP
growth has been positive but small in recent quarters, and the pace of
recovery in U.K. economic activity has not been sufficient to lower the
unemployment rate. In fact, the unemployment rate has continued to
climb and stood at 12.3 percent (s.a.) in July -- 1.5 percentage points
higher than a year earlier, and nearly twice the rate prevailing in July
1980.
Latest data indicate a further slowing of inflation in the United
Kingdom. Between April and July, consumer prices increased only 4 per-
cent (a.r.). The July consumer price index was 8 percent higher than

IV -15
its year-earlier level.
In the first six months of this year, the U.K.'s trade account
registered a surplus of $ 3/4 billion and the current-account surplus was
some $2 billion. Both figures are down sharply from 1981 levels. Be-
tween the second quarters of 1981 and 1982, export volume rose about 5
percent while the volume of imports increased over 14 percent.
In mid-July, the London clearing banks lowered their base rate
from 12 to 12 percent and at the beginning of August the rates were
reduced another percentage point. On August 18, clearing banks low-
ered their base rates to 11 percent. Bank of England actions to lower
short-term money market rates preceded the recent declines in the clear-
ing banks' base rates.
French economic growth turned negative in the first quarter, after
averaging nearly 3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the previous three quarters.
Growth in consumer expenditure remained strong at over 5 percent. Ex-
ports and residential investment were very weak, with expenditure de-
clining by well over 10 percent in each case. Consumer-price inflation
in the second quarter accelerated to 13 percent from 11.8 percent in
the first quarter.
Although French economic policy had been slowly changing emphasis
since the first of the year due to high inflation rates and external
payments problems, the French did not formalize the change until the
June devaluation of the franc. Prices and wages will be frozen until
November and controlled for at least a year thereafter. Deficits in
both the central government and social security budgets are to be re-
duced. Investment is to replace consumption as the key sector through

IV -16
which the economy will be stimulated. No changes were announced for
monetary targets or credit controls.
Led by a sharp rise in exports, real GDP in Italy rose 1.4 percent
(s.a.) during the first quarter of this year. However, part of this
growth is believed to reflect inaccurate seasonal adjustment. Infla-
tion has slowed down noticeably. In June, wholesale prices were about
12 percent above their year-earlier level, compared with a 17 percent
rise in the previous 12 months. Consumer-price inflation has registered
a smaller decline: in the year ending in July, the CPI was 16 percent
above its year earlier level, compared with a 19 percent rise in the
previous year.
On August 7 the Spadolini government fell as the Socialists with-
drew from the coalition government. One of the last acts of the govern-
ment was to present a package of indirect tax increases designed to re-
duce the 1982-83 budget deficits. The tax changes involved increases in
various VAT rates, some production taxes, corporate tax rates and pen-
sion contributions. These tax increases are supposed to produce a gov-
ernment deficit of 60 trillion lire in 1982 (about 13 percent of GDP)
and 63 trillion lire in 1983. These changes were made by decree laws,
which are effective immediately and must be passed by the Parliament
within 60 days (in this case, by September 30). The dissolution of the
government will complicate the passage of these laws.
In Canada, industrial production (s.a.) rose almost 1 percent in
May -- representing the first rise in this index in ten months. Unem-
ployment has continued to climb to new post-depression highs. In July,

IV -17
the unemployment rate jumped almost 1 percentage point to 11.8 percent.
Consumer-price inflation, which has been in double digits since
mid-1980, still remains high. CPI inflation on a year-over-year basis
was 10.8 percent in July as compared with 11.2 percent in June.
In June, the Canadian trade balance (s.a.) posted a surplus of
$1.6 billion. This brings the cumulative surplus for the first half to
$6.6 billion, which is almost $1 billion more than the surplus for all
of last year.
The Belgian government has recently announced preliminary plans
for the 1983 budget. In an effort to reduce the government borrowing
requirement next year to 10.5 percent of GNP, public spending will be
curbed and indirect taxes will be raised. This year the borrowing re-
quirement is expected to be over 11 percent. At the end of July the
National Bank of Belgium announced a reduction in its discount rate of
one-half percent to 13.5 percent. This change was in response to lower
market rates of interest.
Mexico. The recent deterioration in Mexico's external financial
position had its origins in policies implemented since 1978. At that
time expansionary policies adopted to promote employment yielded a
growth rate averaging over 8 percent in 1978-81, but led to large public
sector deficits, accelerating inflation, and high import growth. A de-
cline in Mexico's international competitiveness, weakness in the world
oil market, a recession in the industrial countries, and an accelerated
rise in interest payments on the growing external debt as world interest
rates reached new highs, resulted in a current-account deficit of $12.9
billion in 1981, compared with. $7.6 billion in 1980.

IV -18
In February 1982, the peso was finally allowed to depreciate sub-
stantially following a drain on Mexico's reserves. However, no support-
ing stabilization program was adopted and, instead, steps were taken to
cushion the impact of the devaluation, including a large across-the-
board wage increase. In the face of a renewed drain on reserves, the
Mexican authorities, on April 21, announced a program to reduce the
public sector deficit, tighten monetary policy, and bring down the cur-
rent-account deficit. The program was not vigorously implemented and
skepticism mounted about its adequacy, as well as about the Government's
ability and willingness to take further steps before a new President
takes office in December. When the Mexican government raised adminis-
tered prices on certain foods and gasoline early in August, fears of
rising wage demands and of possible controls were aroused, and capital
flight accelerated.
The peso was again allowed to depreciate substantially in August
and a dual exchange rate system was instituted, with a preferential rate
for certain imports and debt payments, financed primarily out of oil ex-
port earnings. The reserve drain continued, and transfers from foreign
currency denominated accounts to banks outside the country were banned
and such accounts were ordered paid only in pesos at the free market
rate.
The growing concern of foreign banks over the outlook for Mexico
is shown by the hardening of terms on Mexico's Eurocurrency borrowings
since late last year and by a sharp reduction in the flow of new credits
to Mexico since June. In June, a jumbo loan of $2.5 billion received a

IV -19
poor response from the market and the lead managers were able to sell
down only about 15 percent of the loan. Some banks are reported to be
refusing to roll over maturing obligations. Mexico's total external
debt at mid-year was estimated at close to $80 billion, three-fourths
of which is owed to foreign banks.
