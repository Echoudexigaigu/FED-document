The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity has not yet shown significant signs of recovery.
The unemployment rate in August remained at July's postwar record level
and industrial production edged lower. Retail sales were weak, as part of
the midyear tax cut was offset by slower growth of pretax earnings. In
addition, business spending on capital goods continued to decline, but
residential construction activity has shown some small improvement. At
the same time incoming data on wages and prices remain very encouraging.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor demand weakened again in August as nonfarm employment fell
210,000; moreover weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance
remained high though mid-September. Substantial layoffs resumed in durable
manufacturing industries in August, and the factory workweek fell 0.3
hours, erasing the small gains that had occurred over the April to July
period. The losses of factory jobs occurred almost entirely within the
major metals and metal-using industries, which were apparently still
experiencing difficulties in reducing inventories. These industries,
which include primary and fabricated metals, electrical and nonelectrical
machinery, and transportation equipment, have accounted for about half of
the 2 million overall decline in nonfarm payroll employment since the
prerecession peak in July 1981. In nondurable goods industries, employ-
ment leveled off. Although trade and government employment growth con-
tinued to be weak in August, jobs in finance and services were still
expanding.
The unemployment rate held steady in August at 9.8 percent. Over
the last several months, joblessness among adult men has risen faster

than among adult women, reflecting employment declines in blue-collar
industries. As the period of economic slack has lengthened, more
individuals have been unemployed for an extended interval. Over the
summer, about 1.7 percent of the labor force had been without a job for
more than six months--about the same as the previous high in the fourth
quarter of 1975.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production edged down 0.5 percent in August. About half
of this decline can be attributed to a reduction in auto assemblies from
6.6 to 5.5 million units per year. Output of other consumer goods edged
down, and there was a further reduction in the production of business
equipment. The overall production index now stands 10 percent below its
recent cyclical peak attained in July 1981. With the August decline in
output, the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing dropped to 69.4
percent, only slightly above the postwar record low of 69.0 percent set
in 1975.
Output of business equipment fell 1.4 percent in August following
larger declines in the five preceding months. Business equipment produc-
tion was 18 percent below its July 1981 peak; this compares with a drop
of 23 percent in the 1957-58 recession and a 14 percent reduction in 1974-
75. Cutbacks in business equipment output during August were widespread,
with the largest reduction occurring in building and mining equipment,
as oil and gas well drilling posted another large decline. On the
positive side, output of defense and space equipment continued to trend
upward, and the production of construction supplies increased slightly

in August for the third consecutive month, accompanying the sluggish
recovery in residential construction.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Disposable personal income rose little in August, following a large
increase in July, which was generated by a cost-of-living increase in
social security benefits and the midyear tax cut. Reflecting the weakness
in labor demand, wages and salaries--which usually account for most of the
fluctuations in personal income--rose only $2.7 billion or about one-third
the gain in July and well below the average monthly increase of $6.8
billion in the second quarter.
Consumer spending in August remained weak as total retail sales
declined 0.9 percent, offsetting most of the gain in July. Excluding
automotive outlets and stores that primarily sell nonconsumption items,
retail sales increased 1.2 percent in July and only 0.2 percent in August.
The personal saving rate averaged 7.3 percent in July and August
compared with the second quarter average of 6.7 percent. Some of the
recent increase in the saving rate may be attributable to concerns about
the unemployment outlook and an unwillingness to incur new debts, as well
as the usual delay in adjusting spending to the tax cut. Measures of
consumer sentiment for both August and September suggest that spending
is being held back by high interest rates and uncertainty about future
economic conditions.
The only firm information on consumer spending in September relates
to auto sales. Sales of new domestic autos rose to a 6 million unit
annual rate in the first 20 days of the month, compared with an average
pace of 5 million units in the preceding three months. However, much of

the September increase appears to reflect sales that were made in antic-
ipation of the termination of a number of dealer incentive programs.
Many such programs were instituted over the summer in order to eliminate
excess stocks of 1982 models.
Business Fixed Investment
Capital spending continued to decline through August reflecting
weak final demand, low capacity utilization, and high interest rates.
Equipment spending moved lower as shipments of nondefense capital goods--
a rough measure of about 80 percent of expenditures on producers' durable
equipment--fell 1.8 percent in July and 3.0 percent in August. Outlays
for nonresidential structures displayed the first signs of a sharp contrac-
tion during the recession, as construction spending dropped 3 percent in
July. Additional reductions occurred in oil and gas well drilling, which
fell in both July and August.
Commitments data for capital spending indicate further reductions
in the months ahead. Although orders for nondefense capital goods increased
in July, this was largely offset by a reduction in August. Orders were
more than 10 percent below shipments in August, suggesting further reduc-
tions in shipments over the near term. In the structures category,
contracts for commercial buildings fell 22 percent in July (in terms of
square footage) after showing substantial reductions since the beginning

appreciable declines in commercial building in the coming months.
Survey results also indicate that business plans to reduce invest-
ment spending in the months ahead. The Commerce Department's survey of

August, reported that businesses have cut their spending plans for 1982
again. The December 1981 survey reported a planned rise in plant and
equipment spending for 1982 of 7.4 percent. This was followed by surveys
which steadily scaled back these plans: increases of 7.3 percent in
February; 2.2 percent in May; and now 0.7 percent in August. In addition,
the Conference Board reported in early September that the nation's 1,000
largest manufacturers reduced capital appropriations by 28 percent in the
second quarter of 1982.
Housing
New residential construction activity, as measured by housing starts
and permits, fell in August, reversing much of the July increase. Never-
theless, housing starts in August still were above the second-quarter
average. These developments extended the gradual improvement in housing
activity that began last autumn and have paralleled the reduction in
the cost of mortgage credit.
The improvement in housing activity in recent months largely
reflects developments within the multifamily sector. Despite a reduction
in such activity in August, multifamily starts last month were 13 percent
above the second-quarter pace and 24 percent above the trough registered
in the third quarter of last year. As much as a third of the increase
in multifamily starts in July and August may be attributed to an increase
in HUD-subsidized (Section 8) rental construction, while the remainder
probably represents construction of condominium and co-op units.
While single-family housing activity has edged up from the quarterly
low of 537,000 units reached in the fourth quarter of 1981, the continued
absence of a recovery in sales of existing and new homes has restrained the

growth in single-family starts. Sales of existing homes fell 5 percent
in August, and new home sales through July were close to their recent
cyclical trough. However, measured inventories of unsold units are at an
11-year low, and any significant improvement in sales might quickly be
translated into new production. According to industry reports, such an
upturn in sales may have commenced in late August and early September as
mortgage interest rates fell more than they had in the month before.
Inventory Investment
Manufacturing and trade inventories increased in July at an annual
rate of $4.7 billion in constant dollars, the second consecutive month
of accumulation. All of the accumulation occurred in trade inventories,
but the liquidation of manufacturing inventories slowed to an annual rate
of $1.7 billion from an $8.7 billion pace in the preceding month. The
July accumulation was concentrated in automotive products, reflecting
weak auto sales in June and July. This pushed inventory-sales ratios
higher in both wholesale and retail trade.
Constant-dollar liquidation of manufacturing inventories occurred
in durable stocks, while nondurable stocks increased in July. Sizable
overhangs persist in a number of durable goods industries, particularly
in metals and machinery. In constant-dollar terms, the stock-to-sales
ratio for nonelectrical machinery continued to climb in July, reaching
its highest level in the current cycle; the ratio for primary metals also
remained high in July.
Federal Government
The federal deficit totaled over $35 billion on a unified budget
basis during July and August. Adjustment for normal seasonal factors

would reduce this deficit to about $26 billion--or $156 billion at an
annual rate. On the receipts side of the budget, individual withholding
has been reduced by the July 1 tax cut. In addition, the pace of corporate
tax receipts has slowed as a result of substantial refunds on prior-year
tax payments. Federal outlays over this period were increased by the
July cost-of-living adjustment for social security benefits. And, as
the table below shows, defense outlays (other than compensation) have
been adding to the rise in total outlays in recent months, after relatively
little growth early this year.

Congressional action on the FY 1983 budget continues to lag behind
the timetable established in the 1974 Budget Act. At most, four of the
thirteen appropriations bills are expected to be completed during the
current week before the beginning of a congressional recess on October 2.
A continuing resolution that will provide interim funding for the govern-
ment until December 15 has passed the House; the Senate is expected to

II-18
take up the continuing resolution this week. The resolution funds most
programs at current levels; defense expenditures would be funded at the
higher level approved by the House appropriations committee. The President
has called for a special session of Congress after the November elections
to complete the appropriations process.
State and Local Government
State and local purchases remain sluggish, with revised second-
quarter data showing no change in real spending. Construction spending
rose a little in June and July, but was still 3.6 percent below a year
earlier. The only observed strength occurred in highway expenditures.
Preliminary data indicated that state and local government employ-
ment declined by over 100,000 in July, and stayed at that level in August.
Previously, employment had held steady from January to May, followed by a
32,000 reduction in June. The recent sharp drop in jobs appears rather
unusual, but could be related to problems in measuring school employment
over the summer months.
Prices
The price data for August suggest that the acceleration in prices
earlier this summer mainly reflected temporary developments in markets
for energy, food, and housing, rather than a widespread pickup of infla-
tion. The consumer price index rose at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate in
August, its smallest increase since April; CPI increases have averaged
about 5 percent at an annual rate so far this year. Prices of most
producer goods also rose moderately in August. Moreover, the widespread
weakness in materials prices this year and the continued deceleration in
wages point to an underlying trend toward lower inflation rates.

One factor that boosted inflation rates in the early summer was a
rebound in energy prices. Although the pickup in energy inflation will
boost aggregate price measures for the third quarter, monthly data show
that the rise in gasoline prices proved to be short-lived. At the retail
level, energy prices slowed substantially in July and then leveled off in
August. Gasoline prices fell slightly in August and were below their
levels of a year earlier. There is substantial slack in world oil markets,
which should continue to ease near-term pressure on energy prices.
In the food sector, just as in the energy sector, an upturn in
inflation in early summer proved to be temporary. The CPI measure of
food prices fell at a 2 percent annual rate from June to August after
rising at a 7-1/4 percent rate over the three preceding months. In
addition, prices of crude foods have dropped sharply over the summer,
reflecting both sluggish demand and another year of exceptionally good
harvests.
The rise in homeownership costs-a third factor that had boosted the
CPI earlier in the summer--also slowed in August as house prices leveled
off. Recent declines in mortgage interest rates are expected to show up
in the CPI beginning in September. Starting in January, the All-Urban
CPI will no longer include mortgage interest rates or the current house price
measure, which has become increasingly unreliable because of a shrinking
FHA-insured sample base. Excluding food, energy, and homeownership, the
August CPI increase was at about a 5 percent annual rate.
Labor Costs
Wage inflation decreased considerably this year, reflecting the down-
trend in the overall rate of inflation and the erosion of employment

opportunities. From December to August, the hourly earnings index for
production workers, a fixed-weighted measure of wage rates covering about
four-fifths of all nonfarm workers, rose 6-1/2 percent at an annual rate,
down from 8-1/2 percent for 1981. The more comprehensive employment cost
index, which includes white-collar workers as well as production workers,
provides more perspective on how widespread this deceleration has become.
White-collar earnings had risen close to 9 percent for most of the last
two years, but in the first half of 1982, they rose at only a 6.3 percent
rate. Blue-collar earnings in this index also have decelerated from 8.6
percent in 1981 to a rate of 5.1 percent in the first half of 1982.
Average hourly compensation, which includes wages as well as fringe benefits,
rose 6-3/4 percent in the first half of 1982, about the same rate of increase
as for wages alone and 2 percentage points below last year's pace.
Improvement in productivity performance during the first half of
1982 helped to offset the effect of increases in compensation on labor
costs. Output per hour advanced at a 1/2 percent annual rate in the first
and second quarters following a cyclical decline in the last half of 1981,
and increases in unit labor costs in the private nonfarm sector averaged
about 6-1/2 percent over the past two quarters, down considerably from
an increase of nearly 9 percent in 1981.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1 rebounded in August after three months of small declines and
continued to expand rapidly in September, moving this aggregate back
above the upper end of its 1982 growth range. Expansion in M2 and M3
accelerated in August from already rapid growth rates and, even with a
marked slowdown in September, these aggregates remained well above their
longer-run ranges.
Reflecting some tightening in reserve availability accompanying the
recent strength in M1, the federal funds rate has risen over the inter-
meeting period. At the time of the August FOMC meeting, the funds rate
had fallen to the 9 percent area, well below the discount rate, as market
participants were anticipating further System action to ease money market
conditions. More recently, funds have traded primarily between 9-3/4 and
10-1/2 percent.
Private short-term market rates in the one- to three-month maturity
range have risen 3/4 to 1-3/4 percentage points during the intermeeting
period, but Treasury bill rates are about unchanged. The widening spread
between Treasury bills and private instruments is probably explained by
heightened concern about credit quality. Recently, this concern seems to
have been accentuated by the exposure of domestic banks to potential los-
ses on their foreign loans. Large quality spreads in commercial paper
rates also attest to continued market nervousness about the financial
health of domestic corporations, although such spreads have receded some-
what from the exceptionally high levels reached in late August.
Bond yields have fallen about 25 to 50 basis points since the August
FOMC meeting. The Treasury yield curve is still steeply upward sloping in

the maturity range out to 2 years. This configuration suggests market
expectations of a rise in rates in the months ahead as a recovery in
economic activity and the resulting growth in private money and credit
demands along with the prospect of continued massive federal borrowing
outweigh the improved inflation outlook.
The Treasury raised a record $60 billion in the market in the third
quarter, financing a large deficit and building up its cash balance.
State and local governments also have continued to borrow heavily, pri-
marily in the form of revenue bonds. In contrast, borrowing by nonfinan-
cial corporations appears to have diminished, particularly in short-term
markets. Bond offerings, however, have picked up in response to improved
conditions in long-term capital markets. Household borrowing in the mort-
gage and consumer installment credit markets has remained sluggish.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
With all components gaining strength, M1 increased at a 10-1/2 per-
cent annual rate in August and still more rapidly in September, after
three consecutive months of weakness.1 (Data on the monetary aggregates
in September will be included in the Greenbook Supplement.) Demand depos-
its increased in August for the first time since January of this year and
accelerated sharply in September. This increase, along with renewed growth
in other checkable deposits after a net decline between April and July,
seems partly due to the recent large decline in market interest rates.2 In
1. The alternative model-based seasonal adjustment procedure indicates an
even sharper turnaround in narrow money growth from July to September.
2. One way in which declines in interest rates probably affect money hold-
ings is by increasing the balances banks require corporations to hold in
conpensation for receiving services. An Appendix to the Greenbook Supple-
ment will report on an informal survey conducted recently by System staff
concerning bank practices contributing to the responsiveness of compensat-
ing balances to changes in interest rates.

III-4
addition, increased stock market transactions in August may have contri-
buted to the strength of demand balances in early September.
M2 grew in August at the fastest rate since April 1981, as the bulge
in its M1 component was augmented by a pickup in growth of its nontransac-
tions component. This acceleration mainly reflected a surge in general
purpose and broker-dealer money fund shares as returns on the funds lagged
declines in market rates. In addition, overnight RPs strengthened--as bank
dealer positions rose--and runoffs of savings deposits moderated, likely
reflecting the reduced opportunity cost of holding such instruments as well
as prevailing economic uncertainties. Small time deposit inflows at com-
mercial banks and thrifts dropped, particularly in the shorter maturities.1
Following the August surge, growth of the nontransaction component of
M2 has slowed sharply in September. In early September, as market rates
backed up, money market fund shares leveled off and are expected to register
only a moderate increase on a month average basis.2 Although savings depos-
its appear to have edged upward this month, small time deposit inflows evi-
dently weakened further.3
1. Commercial banks continue to issue substantially more small time depos-
its than thrifts except in the longer maturities. The longer maturity
accounts include the 2-1/2 year and over small saver certificate--the
only account at present where thrifts benefit from a ceiling differential--
and the ceiling-free 3-1/2 year certificate.
2. Money market mutual funds do not appear to be as vulnerable to outflows
of shares as they were in the late summer of 1980, when they lost 10 per-
cent of their assets in 4-1/2 months as interest rates rose. The average
maturity currently is 37 days, compared with 51 days in August of 1980,
which should allow fund managers to take advantage of any rise in rates
more quickly than in 1980.
3. Inflows at S&Ls to the new 7 to 31 day accounts were $400 million in the
first 10 days of September. Inflows to commercial banks may be stronger as
there currently is no ceiling differential for thrifts. In addition, scat-
tered reports imply some interest by commercial enterprises, who would be
more likely to deposit funds in a commercial bank than in a thrift institu-
tion.

III-5
M3 grew in August at a near-record 18.4 percent rate, but growth in
September appears to be to the slowest since the spring of 1980. Its non-
M2 components accelerated in August as a pickup in growth of institution-
only money funds, along with a resumption of growth of term RPs, more than
offset a slowdown in issuance of large CDs. The increase in term RPs was
concentrated at commercial banks and may in part have reflected financing
of increased holdings of Treasury securities in trading accounts. The
slowdown in M3 in September reflected not only weak M2 growth but also a
small decline in large time deposits, a runoff of term RPs, and a sharp
slowdown in the growth of institution-only money funds.
Bank credit growth in August continued at about the moderate July
pace, somewhat slower than in the first half of the year. Acquisitions
of securities picked up, but loan growth slowed and was well below the
rate of expansion in the first half of the year. Consumer and real estate
lending remained sluggish, and business loan growth dropped to the lowest
rate since last November. A slowing in bank credit growth is indicated by
partial data for September. Business loan growth at large banks picked up
through mid-September, but this was more than offset by slower growth in
other loans and investments at these banks and by weaker credit extensions
at U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks and at small banks. A sig-
nificant portion of the strengthening in business loans at large banks
seems to have been associated with takedowns for mergers.1
1. Takedowns involving two acquisitions have been reported to date. The
first, by R. J. Reynolds, involved a credit of $250 million on September 2
and is believed to have been booked primarily at U.S. banking offices.
The second, by Occidental Petroleum, involved two credits totalling $1.75
billion. Financing of the Bendix -Martin Marietta -Allied deal boosted
bank credit in the second half of September.

Available evidence indicates that public awareness of problem loans
at commercial banks likely had some impact on investor willingness to pur-
chase bank CDs as the quality spread between CD and Treasury bill rates
has widened recently and remains substantially above the average for the
first half of this year. Prior to September, actual runoffs of CDs were
concentrated largely at those banks receiving the most widespread publi-
city. Three such banks, Continental, Seattle First, and to a lesser
extent, Chase, appear to have had difficulty rolling over CDs in both
July and August. These banks, however, were apparently able to rely
on the interbank market--principally by borrowing through their foreign
branches and International Banking Facilities--to make up for these out-
flows and their lending did not slacken appreciably relative to other
large banks during the period. In September the decline in CD issuance
was more general among large banks, as the weakening in loan growth at
small banks augmented the supply of funds in the domestic interbank mar-
ket.
Business Finance
The weakening in business demands for short-term credit has extended
beyond business loans at banks to commercial paper issuance. However, the
falloff in short-term financing has been largely matched by a pickup in
long-term borrowing as declining interest rates elicited a sizable increase
in bond offerings. Gross public offerings of corporate bonds in U.S. mar-
kets reached $5.3 billion in August on a seasonally adjusted basis, com-
pared to a monthly average rate of $2.2 billion in the first half of the
year. In September such offerings are estimated to have edged down only
slightly to $5.0 billion.

III-9
The mix of bond offerings in the third quarter has shifted toward
industrial concerns, which had sold relatively few bonds earlier in the
year. Although firms continue to emphasize short- and intermediate-term
issues, the most recent financings have included a greater number of bonds
maturing in 20 to 30 years, including a few large industrial issues. In
addition to funds raised in domestic markets, close to $1.2 billion of
Eurobond offerings were sold by U.S. companies in August. The pace of
such offerings has strengthened further in September, as foreign investors
have been willing to purchase such bonds at more favorable yields than
those in U.S. markets.
If corporations are to restore measures of balance sheet liquidity
to more "normal" levels, the volume of future bond issuance will have to
be huge. The combined amount of 415 shelf registrations plus the recent
backlog of conventionally registered issues that could be brought to market
without prior notice currently totals about $20 billion, but this repre-
sents only a small portion of the funding activity that might be undertaken
once firms feel the time is right. To date, bond issuance has been fairly
restrained as finance officers evidently have been reluctant to pass up
the immediate interest savings made possible by comparatively low short-
term rates and are perhaps hoping for still lower long-term rates.
The decline in interest rates through late August helped spark a
strong and broadly-based rally in equity prices. Since the rally began
the major composite indexes have risen 18 to 22 percent, in heavy trading
reportedly dominated by institutions. The continuation of the rally
through September, albeit on a much less steep trajectory, suggests that
factors other than interest rates also have exerted a positive influence.

It is possible that investors have revised downward their expectations of
future inflation; lower inflation rates should eliminate some of the fac-
tors that damped corporate profitability and raised investors' risk pre-
miums over the past decade.
The rise in share prices prompted increased stock issuance in August,
primarily offerings by utilities which were boosted by a sizable AT&T issue.
Merger deals, however, continue to absorb outstanding stock.
Government Finance
Federal sector. In September the Treasury raised a record $21.9 bil-
lion of new cash in the market, to finance a $4.9 billion combined deficit
and an extraordinary buildup in its cash balance. The bulk of this borrow-
ing--$17.0 billion--was done in the coupon market, the remainder being
accomplished by enlarging the size of the regular weekly and monthly bill
auctions.
The Treasury compressed the auction schedule of its 4- and 7-year
notes and 20-year bonds into a shorter time period than usual in an effort
to increase bidding interest in the issues. In addition, the Treasury
moved the settlement dates of the 7-year note and 20-year bond into Septem-
ber--thus magnifying the increase in the cash balance in September--in
light of the impending expiration of the temporary debt ceiling. Congress
subsequently approved legislation to increase the debt ceiling to $1.3
trillion for fiscal year 1983. The 20-year issue in September was the
first bond sold since this past February, when the Treasury exhausted its
authority to issue bonds with coupons greater than 4-1/4 percent; expanded
authority was included in the August tax bill.

Federally sponsored credit agencies did essentially no net new bor-
rowing in August, although they are estimated to have borrowed $1.6 bil-
lion in September. The FHLBs have reduced outstanding debt over the past
couple of months because of sizable repayments of advances by thrift insti-
tutions. Mortgage purchases by FNMA have been substantial over the past
two months, but the agency has financed a large part of its purchases by
reductions in liquid assets which had reached an abnormally high level at
the end of July.
State and Local Sector. The gross volume of municipal bond issuance
was a record $6.8 billion (seasonally adjusted) in August and about that
again in September. Recently, offerings of municipal securities have been
boosted by the sale of a large volume of mortgage revenue bonds, averaging
about $1.7 billion per month for the third quarter. The decline in inter-
est rates over this period may have prompted a number of issuers to come
to market. In addition, federal law restricts the total value of mortgage
bonds that can be sold by tax-exempt housing authorities within any given
state for any given year; thus, any part of a state's quota not sold during
the year is lost. Also, mortgage revenue bond issuance has become more
attractive because of an IRS ruling and a change in the tax law that have
increased the spread allowed between the yields on these bonds and on the
mortgages or other investments purchased with their proceeds.
Spreads between yields on general obligation and revenue issues have
narrowed considerably over the past month from the historically high 150
basis point gap that had opened up in August. Investors at that time may
have been attracted to general obligations in the wake of the bankruptcy
of Lombard-Wall, since municipal authorities had been prominent among the

III-14
RP creditors in this firm.1 Within the general obligation market itself,
quality spreads between yields on prime- and medium-grade securities are
comparatively wide by historical standards, but lower-rated issuers still
have access to the market. With its economy and state revenues especially
dependent on the cyclically-sensitive automobile industry, Michigan has
evoked the most concern among investors. Michigan is the only state that
presently has a MIG-3 rating on its notes, which would be expected to
raise significantly the costs of its scheduled offering of $500 million of
short-term debt in October.2 The state, however, has tentatively acquired
a letter of credit from five Japanese banks that will enhance the quality
of these notes and reduce interest costs.
Mortgage Markets
In the primary market, interest rates on new commitments for 30-year,
fixed-rate conventional home mortgages at savings and loan associations
have declined since the August FOMC meeting by about a percentage point
to 15.19 percent. Declining yields in secondary mortgage markets produced
relatively narrow discounts on GNMA-guaranteed securities, prompting a 50
basis point cut in the ceiling rate for level-payment FHA/VA home loans to
13-1/2 percent, effective September 24.
Rates posted by both FNMA and FHLMC for the purchase of some types
of adjustable-rate home mortgages have come down markedly since mid-year.
1. Several issuers of revenue securities, notably the New York State Dor-
mitory Authority, invested funds in repurchase agreements with Lombard-
Wall. Expeditious release of the money to these authorities by the courts
may have alleviated the concern of market participants as to the potential
problems resulting from lengthy bankruptcy proceedings.
2. The bond ratings of Washington, New Hampshire, and Minnesota were also
reduced this year. Municipal note ratings range from MIG (Moody's Inves-
tors Grade)-l, the highest, down to MIG-4.

III-15
The largest reductions have been made for those programs with short-term
rate indexes and few constraints on future changes to mortgage rates or
payments. At FNMA, for example, the rate posted for adjustable rate mort-
gages indexed to 6-month Treasury bills and having no limits on rate or
payment adjustments was 13.44 percent on September 22, down by about 4
percentage points from June 30.
Despite the decline in mortgage rates, available evidence indicates
that mortgage market activity continued sluggish through August at savings
and loan associations. New and outstanding mortgage commitments edged up,
but stayed within the narrow bands that have prevailed since late last
year. The net change in total mortgage assets at S&Ls declined by about
10 percent in August to the lowest level of the year; as in other recent
months holdings of mortgage backed securities increased substantially while
the volume of mortgage loans declined. This change in portfolio composi-
tion primarily reflected large swaps of conventional mortgages for more
liquid federally underwritten pass-through securities that are eligible
collateral for borrowing under repurchase agreements.
The quality of home mortgage credit clearly has deteriorated further
owing to slack overall economic activity and weaker home prices. Delin-
quency rates on home mortgages climbed to new highs during the second quar-
ter of this year; foreclosure rates remained at the elevated levels shown
in the first quarter, but they still were below the highs reached in 1973-
75, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit, which had risen during the
second quarter to almost a 5 percent annual rate, slowed to a 2 percent

III-16
annual rate in July, mainly because of flatness in loans for autos and
non-auto consumer goods. Moreover, available bank data suggests that
installment credit growth was weak again in August.

Consumer installment credit has expanded at an unusually slow pace
during the business cycle downturn not only because of weaker demands, but
also because many lenders have maintained relatively stringent credit pol-
icies since the 1980 recession and the consumer credit restraint program.
Several recent financial developments, however, appear to favor more rapid
growth in consumer financing in the near term. The yield spread between
consumer loan rates and the marginal cost of deposit funds rose during the
second and third quarters, and survey data and other reports indicate a
greater willingness by larger commercial banks to extend consumer loans.
In addition, the continued decline to new lows of delinquency rates on both

III-17
outstanding closed-end loans at commercial banks and automobile credit at
finance companies, which also reflected in part the cautious lending prac-
tices evident since 1980, may provide added impetus to growth in consumer
credit.

Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown by the chart on the next page, the weighted average
value of the dollar has appreciated slightly further during the third
quarter, despite the sharp declines in dollar interest rates relative
to foreign interest rates. During the periods when the declines in
dollar interest rates were most pronounced -- in particular, for
several weeks following the FOMC meeting at the beginning of July,
and again during the weeks just prior to the August FOMC meeting --
the exchange value of the dollar declined markedly, but only tempo-
rarily. From its trough at the time of the August FOMC meeting to
the 13-year peak that it reached on September 27-28, the weighted
average value of the dollar appreciated by about 5 percent. This
weighted-average change reflected appreciations of roughly 7 percent
against the yen and Swiss franc, 5-1/2 percent against the mark,
4-1/2 percent against the pound, and 1/4 percent against the Canadian
dollar. In part, the dollar's appreciation since late August has been
associated with an increase of around 125 basis points in relative
dollar interest rates, reflecting an upturn in dollar interest rates
and a continued gradual decline in the average of foreign interest
rates. In addition, an important part of the dollar's strength
during recent months has been related to major uncertainties about
financial and political conditions throughout the world. The report
of an August U.S. trade deficit that was much greater than most
market participants expected had only a temporary downward impact on
the value of the dollar.

.Subsequently, French officials announced that they were
arranging a $4 billion Eurocurrency credit to supplement their reserves
available for supporting the franc. The prospective collapse of the
Schmidt government (see the discussion on German developments below)
contributed to a moderate strengthening of the mark against other
EMS currencies during September as market participants anticipated
that German economic policy might become somewhat more conservative.
At the end of September the Belgian franc was the weakest currency
in the EMS band, about 1/2 percent above its intervention floors
against the Dutch guilder and Irish pound.
Interbank trading in Mexican pesos has virtually halted since
the August FOMC meeting following the Mexican Government's decisions
to nationalize private Mexican banks and to impose comprehensive

IV-4
foreign exchange controls. Mexico's outstanding international debts
for the large part have been rolled over and Mexico has been engaged
in negotiating a credit program with the International Monetary Fund.
At the end of August it was announced that a $1.85 billion short-
term credit line had been extended to Mexico from the United States
and member countries of the Bank for International Settlements.
The Mexican crisis has contributed to inten-
sified concerns about the ability of a number of other Latin American
countries to make scheduled external payments, and Bolivia has fallen
into arrears on a relatively small amount of debt.
Prices of precious metals have fluctuated widely since the
August FOMC meeting. After trading in a relatively narrow range
around $350 per ounce from mid-July through mid-August, gold appre-
ciated to more than $500 an ounce at times during the second week
of September, subsequently depreciating to about $415 an ounce
currently.

IV-5
Foreign lending by U.S. banks. Claims on foreigners held by domestic
offices and foreign branches of U.S.-chartered banks increased only about
$7 billion in the first half of 1982 compared with $31 billion in the same
period one year earlier. About one-third to one-half of the slowdown
resulted from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar in the first half of
1982, which reduced the dollar value of the foreign currency assets of the
foreign branches. The appreciation primarily affected local-currency
claims at branches in G-10 countries, reducing the dollar value of their
claims by $8-10 billion. (An even larger such reduction occurred a year
earlier.)
U.S. bank claims on smaller industrial countries increased in the
first half of 1982 about in line with recent past behavior, and claims on
OPEC also rose. But there was a marked slowing in net new lending to non-
OPEC developing countries. Net lending to Mexico and Brazil continued
strong in the first half, but net lending to Argentina, Korea, Philippines,
and Chile slowed sharply or became negative. U.S. bank claims on Eastern
European countries, especially Poland, declined significantly in the first
half. The decline for Poland largely reflected the assumption by the CCC
of bank credits that the U.S. government had guaranteed.
The clouded outlook for future international lending by U.S. and for-
eign banks, especially affected by the difficulties of Mexico and other
Latin American countries in repaying debts, is shown by Morgan Guaranty
data indicating a low level of announced syndicated Eurocurrency bank cred-
its for developing countries in both July and August, particularly for
Latin American borrowers. These data suggest a growing reluctance by
bankers to commit themselves to provide additional medium-term credits to
these countries.

U.S. International Transactions
Merchandise trade. In August the U.S. merchandise trade deficit
was substantially larger than in July primarily because the value of non-
oil imports rose sharply. The August nonoil import increase was spread
over a broad range of manufactured items (from machinery to clothing);
a marginal rise in the value of foreign car imports accounted for a
small fraction of the total nonoil import increase.
For July-August combined, the trade deficit was more than twice
the size of the second-quarter rate; a 4-1/2 percent drop in exports
was combined with a 9 percent increase in imports. Most of the decline

in exports was in agricultural shipments, particularly wheat and corn.
Export prices for agricultural products continued to weaken in July
and August in response to generally good crops and sluggish demand;
some traditional purchasers of U.S. wheat and corn have sought other
suppliers who offered either better prices or easier credit terms;
Japan sought easier prices,and Brazil and Eastern Europe sought easier
credit. Since May, the U.S.S.R. has not purchased any additional U.S.
wheat or feedgrain; deliveries on the May order were completed in July.
The decline in non-agricultural exports was spread over industrial
supplies (particularly coal and metals), machinery and consumer goods as
continued sluggish demand frommajor trading partners and effects of a
strong dollar were reflected in shipments.
The July-August rise in imports was largely in oil. The volume
of oil imports in both July and August was 6.3 million barrels per day,
one-third higher than in the second quarter. U.S. oil consumption was
apparently somewhat lower in the third quarter than in the second but
there was some buildup in total petroleum and product inventories (on a
seasonally adjusted basis). Oil import prices were about 75 cents per
barrel higher in July-August than in the second quarter reflecting the

delayed impact of the increase in spot prices during late spring.
Since June, spot crude oil prices have been somewhat lower. For nonoil
imports,the increase was largely in manufactured goods, ranging from
chemicals to machinery and consumer goods. The value of foreign car
imports in July-August was marginally less than in the second quarter.
Steel imports dropped sharply from second-quarter rates.
Capital-Account Transactions. Net liabilities of U.S. banking
offices (including IBFs) to their own foreign offices fell, on a monthly
average basis, by about $4 billion in August (see line 1(a) of the table
below). Data for the first eight days of September indicate a further
sizable reduction in net liabilities; in fact, U.S.-chartered banks
shifted to a position of net supplier of funds to their foreign offices
(line 1(b)). Regional U.S. banks have generally maintained or increased
net placements with their foreign offices as yields in the Eurodollar
interbank market have remained attractive when compared with the cost
of funds raised through domestic CDs. Banks also continued to increase
their net claims on unaffiliated foreigners through July.
Loans to U.S. nonbank residents from foreign branches of U.S.
banks (line 2 of the table) accelerated during August on a daily average
basis. As outlined in previous Greenbooks, bank loans booked at foreign
branches tend to increase when the prime rate exceeds LIBOR by substantial
amounts; in August, the spread between those rates rose to as much as
330 basis points. By mid-September, however, incentives had changed
considerably: the prime rate exceeded LIBOR by less than 150 basis points.

IV -10
Though there have been reports that investors have recently begun
favoring low-risk assets such as U.S. Treasury issues and high-grade U.S.
corporate debt and equity, there is no evidence yet that private foreign
investors have shifted substantial amounts into such instruments. For
example, available data for August indicate that private foreign holdings
of U.S. Treasury obligations may have declined somewhat. Net foreign
purchases of U.S. corporate stock appear from preliminary data to have
been no larger in August than they were on average during the first seven
months of 1982, shown in 1982 (line 2(b), page IV-12 in the Summary Table of
U.S. International Transactions. These data are consistent with information
acquired in conversations with several brokerage houses, which indicated
that foreign participation in the sharp stock market surge during August
was noticeable only briefly and in small volume.

U.S. Current Account. In the second quarter, the U.S. current
account surplus increased to an $8 billion annual rate; this was about
twice the size of the surplus in the first quarter. Much of the higher
current account surplus was attributable to a rise in net income from
portfolio investments (line 7 in the table below): income receipts from
U.S. claims on foreigners rose more than income payments to foreigners
on foreign portfolio holdings in the United States. Net direct invest-
ment income receipts, line 6, was little changed from the relatively
low levels of 1Q82, largely reflecting weak economic conditions abroad.
The merchandise trade deficit was about the same in second quarter as
in the first quarter with the value of both exports and imports declin-

Foreign Economic Developments. Foreign economic activity remains
generally sluggish, with no firm evidence of a sustained recovery. Al-
though real GDP rose strongly in Japan and France in the second quarter,
more recent indicators suggest that this strength has not continued.
Real GDP in the second quarter edged up slightly in the United Kingdom,
declined somewhat in Germany, and fell sharply in Canada and Italy. In
the major foreign industrial countries, industrial production has gener-
ally been depressed (see chart). The rate of unemployment in August
rose to 9.6 percent (11 million people) in the EC and to 12.2 per-
cent in Canada. Investment surveys in the major foreign industrial
economies suggest that investment spending will be weak this year. Eco-
nomic activity has also been depressed in the major Latin American coun-
tries. In Mexico, real GDP growth has virtually stopped this year fol-
lowing four years of increases of over 8 percent per year. Real GDP de-
clined last year in Brazil and Argentina; in the first half of 1982, real
GDP was weak in Brazil and declined in Argentina and Chile. Total imports
of these four countries are being drastically reduced this year.
The deceleration of consumer price inflation in major foreign coun-
tries continued on average (see chart), but remains uneven. Consumer
prices accelerated in Italy this summer, though they are still rising
more slowly than last year. Consumer price inflation has not abated sig-
nificantly in Germany in the last year, despite the low rates of increase
in July and August, while in France the recent deceleration appears to be
explained by price controls and a VAT reduction. In the United Kingdom,
the twelve-month inflation rate has continued its decline.

The external position of several of the major foreign countries
continues to reflect the relative weakness of these economies. The
trade and current balances for Canada and Germany have risen from last
year; in Italy (where current account data are not yet available for
the second quarter) the trade deficit has declined in the first seven
months of this year, compared with the same period in 1981. France and
the United Kingdom are the only major foreign countries in which the cu-
mulative trade balance this year is significantly below the corresponding
figure for 1981.
Individual Country Notes. Second-quarter GNP in Germany was 0.4
percent (s.a.) below the level of the first quarter, and the average
level for the first half of this year was virtually unchanged from last
year's first half. Industrial production continued to decline in July
for the fourth consecutive month; the latest three-month average of the
industrial production index was about equal to its 1978 level. The rate
of unemployment reached 7.9 percent (s.a.) in August, two percentage
points above the level of August 1981. The volume of orders, which
earlier this year had been supported by strong orders from abroad, has
declined in recent months as foreign orders weakened. Bankruptcies this
year have been occurring at a rate 50 percent above last year's rate.
Despite the general weakness of demand, the rate of consumer price in-
flation has declined only slightly from last year's relatively high level.
Germany's current account this year provides the only bright spot
in the economy. During the first eight months, the deficit was reduced
to $2.2 billion compared to last year's $10.8 billion for the same pe-
riod. This large improvement was due to rapid growth in export volume

IV -16
earlier this year and more recently, as export volume growth slowed, to
sustained improvement in the terms of trade.
The Bundesbank has continued on its course -- begun late last
year -- of a cautious lowering of interest rates. In a series of steps,
the last of which took place on August 27, the Lombard rate was lowered
from 12 to 8 percent. Central Bank money growth, having been close to
the upper limit of the 4 to 7 percent target range through July, slowed
somewhat in August. On September 23, the Bundesbank lowered reserve
requirements on all categories of deposits by 10 percent; the required
reserve ratio on sight deposits is now 10-1/8 percent, down from 11
percent.
On September 15, the Bundestag passed a supplementary federal bud-
get that increased the 1982 deficit by DM 7.2 billion to DM 33.9 billion
(2 percent of GDP). The supplement was induced by the ongoing reces-
sion. Nevertheless, fiscal policy remains relatively tight; this year's
public sector deficit, now estimated at DM 70 to 75 billion, will be
smaller than last year's DM 80 billion (5 percent of GDP).
On September 17, the Social Democrat -Free Democrat coalition
government collapsed with the resignation of all FDP cabinet members
and the withdrawal of that party from the government. On October 1, the
Bundestag is expected to elect the leader of the conservative Christian
Democrat party, Helmut Kohl as new chancellor. Mr Kohl will form a con-
servative-liberal coalition government which will include once more the
FDP. National elections are expected to be called by March 1983.
The pace of economic activity in Japan continues to be slow, while
the policy debate over measures to stimulate the economy has intensified.

IV -17
Data on real GNP in the second quarter showed surprising strength -- a
5 percent rate of growth (s.a.a.r.). The more rapid growth of GNP was
led by strength in private consumption and government investment, which
in the latter case was attributable to the heavy front-loading of public
works expenditure under the FY 1982 budget. Despite this advance, sec-
ond-quarter GNP was only 2-1/2 percent above its year-previous level, and
more recent indicators of activity suggest that the domestic economy is
in a much less bouyant state than that suggested by the new GNP numbers.
Industrial production (s.a.) in August declined by almost 1 percent; its
average level for the three months ending in August was about 3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) above the average of the previous three months. New machine-
ry orders (s.a.), particularly orders from abroad, were down sharply in
July. The latest assessments of the economy by both the Bank of Japan
and the Economic Planning Agency stressed that plant and equipment in-
vestment by small and medium-scale firms and housing have been particu-
larly weak, but that personal consumption has shown some signs of re-
covering.
Wholesale prices have risen slightly more rapidly in recent months,
largely due to the yen's weakness, but the three-month average (for June-
August) was only 1.7 percent (a.r.) above its level of the previous three
months. Despite an increase of almost 1 percent in August, which was at-
tributed mainly to recent typhoon damage to crops, the corresponding
three-month average for the CPI was virtually unchanged.
Japan's current-account surplus (s.a.) was halved in July to $570
million, bringing the cumulative surplus for the year so far to about
$4 billion. Both imports and exports contracted in July -- the latter

IV -18
for the third consecutive month. Preliminary data suggests that demand
for exports continued to be weak in August.
Faced with the prospect of reduced government revenues, Prime
Minister Suzuki announced a reversal of his previous stand on recon-
struction of government finances and said that the government would
float an additional ¥3 trillion ($11 billion equivalent) in government
bonds to cover the expected FY1982 deficit. The authorities also are
reported to be considering a proposal for additional expenditures.
Latest data for the United Kingdom indicate a continuation of the
sluggish recovery in economic activity and a further deceleration of
prices. In July, industrial production rose 1 percent (s.a.); in the
six months to July, the production index increased some 3 percent
(s.a.a.r.). Real GDP in the second quarter of this year was percent
(s.a.a.r.) above the level registered in the first quarter and 1 per-
cent above its year-earlier level. Despite recent increases, real GDP
in the second quarter was 5 percent below the previous peak reached in
the second quarter of 1979.
Consumer prices in July and August essentially were unchanged.
Between April and August, the annual rate of increase in consumer prices
was only 3 percent. During the same four-month period, wholesale prices
rose 6 percent (a.r.).
After two consecutive monthly surpluses, the U.K.'s trade balance
moved into deficit in August. The cumulative trade balance for the first
eight months of 1982 was $1 billion (s.a.). During the same period, the
current account registered a surplus of some $3 billion.

IV -19
Nominal interest rates in the United Kingdom have continued to de-
cline. At the end of August, the London clearing banks lowered their
base rates from 11 percent to 10 percent. As has been the case in re-
cent months, Bank of England actions to lower short-term money market
rates preceded the reduction in the clearing banks' base rates. In the
six months to August, growth in each of the U.K.'s three targeted mone-
tary aggregates was within the authorities' 8-12 percent target range.
French GDP grew by 1 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter while
industrial production rose by 1 percent, reversing declines in each
measure in the previous quarter. GDP was 1-3/4 percent above its level
of a year earlier while IP was virtually unchanged. July surveys indi-
cate both actual and anticipated production is nearly stagnant. Stocks,
although below last year's peak, are still excessive and have been ris-
ing recently; while orders, although above last year's lows, are still
weak and recently have been falling. Unemployment has continued to in-
crease throughout this year and in August was 8.9 percent compared with
8.3 percent at the end of last year.
Price controls in France seem to be working better than had been
expected. In July and August the annual rate of inflation (n.s.a.) was
only 3-1/2 percent. Part of the decline of the inflation rate can be as-
cribed to a redcution in the VAT on some commodities.
The current-account deficit in the first half of 1982 was nearly
$6 billion (s.a.) compared with a deficit of less than $1 billion for
the first half of last year and a deficit of $5 billion for the whole
of 1981. The second quarter deficit of $4.4 billion was over twice the
first quarter deficit of $2.1 billion. The trade-balance deficit for

IV -20
the first eight months of this year was nearly $10 billion, compared
with only $5 billion in 1981.
The draft budget for 1983 was presented in early September and
contained no surprises. Expenditure will increase by about 12 percent
and revenue by about 9 percent. Although the budget is characterized
officially as an austerity measure, the deficit will remain at about 3
percent of GDP. The budget also includes tax changes to encourage saving
and to direct it toward investment in equity.
Real GDP in Italy fell by 1.5 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter
after rising by a revised 1.2 percent in the previous quarter. Indus-
trial production remains weak: in July, industrial production was 4
percent below its year-earlier level and almost 7 percent below its peak
in 1980. The business conditions survey at the end of June showed a sub-
stantial deterioration from that recorded three months earlier. The de-
terioration in outlook was across the board, but most significantly with
respect to new foreign orders, forecasts of new total orders, and fore-
casts of production.
Although wholesale price inflation has moderated this year, con-
sumer price inflation has accelerated in the last three months, contrary
to the usual seasonal pattern. Part of the increase is attributable to
VAT increases. In August, the CPI was almost 18 percent above its year-
earlier level. The trade account has improved in the first seven months
of the year with a $8.2 billion deficit compared with a deficit of $11
billion in the corresponding period of last year.
On August 25, the Bank of Italy lowered its discount rate by 1 per-
centage point to 18 percent. This change was expected earlier in the

IV -21
month when an increase in indirect taxes was decreed, but was postponed
by the fall of the first Spadolini government. The Spadolini government
was promptly reconstituted with the same five-party coalition and the
same cabinet. This lack of change of the government was seen as an in-
dication that the tax measures will be approved by Parliament.
The absence of an agreement on the wage indexation system has de-
layed the settlement of new contracts for over one-half of the labor
force. In the absence of contractual increases, wage inflation has de-
celerated: in May, wages were 17 percent above their level of the pre-
vious year, compared with rates of increase of 22-24 percent for most of
1980 and 1981.
In Canada, real GNP fell sharply in the second quarter and by more
than was generally expected. The second quarter decline of 8-1/2 percent
(s.a.a.r.) -- which represents the fourth consecutive quarter of declines
-- leaves the level of real GNP more than 6 percent below the level
reached in the second quarter of last year. Weakness was widespread, al-
though there was some recovery of personal expenditure and of merchandise
exports which rose sharply following three quarters of decline. A sharp
run down of inventories of $3.1 billion (2.4 percent of GNP) and a sharp
decline in business investment of about 8.3 percent were the major con-
tributors to the drop in real GNP in the second quarter. Liquidity prob-
lems, low profits, excess capacity, a fall off of foreign investment and
strikes were the main factors behind the weak inventory and investment
performances. The mid-year survey of investment intentions, which was
taken in May and June and showed intentions well below those at the
start of the year, suggests that there would be virtually no real growth

IV -22
in investment spending this year.
Consumer price inflation for the most recent three-month period
(June to August) averaged 10.9 percent (a.r.), down slightly from the
11.6 percent pace of the preceding three months. Sharp increases in
the price of food were the main elements in the continued rapid rise
in the consumer price index.
The current-account balance (s.a.) for the first half of this year
posted a surplus of almost $700 million, compared with a deficit of $2.9
billion for the same period last year. The first half surplus reflects
primarily weak economic activity and, in the second quarter, a recovery
in merchandise exports.
On September 19, the Socialist Democrats were elected to return to
power in Sweden following six years of rule by a three-party coalition.
A major issue in the campaign was the high rate of unemployment, which
was officially 3.7 percent in August. If the part of the labor force
in job retraining programs, relief work, and subsidized labor programs
is included, the unemployment rate would be almost double the official
rate. Real GDP in the first quarter was 1 percent below the previous
cyclical peak (1980:Q4), and industrial production has been flat in the
twelve months ending in May. However, the rate of consumer price infla-
tion has improved markedly in the past year: in August, the CPI was
7-3/4 percent above its year-earlier level, compared with a 13-3/4 per-
cent rise in the corresponding period last year.
The continued weakness of real economic activity in Belgium led to
a further rise in the unemployment rate in July. In response to relative

IV -23
stability of the Belgian franc on the exchange markets, depressed domes-
tic activity, and reduced interest rates abroad, the Belgian National
Bank lowered its discount rate in late August and again in September to
12.5 percent.
In the Netherlands, industrial production during the second quar-
ter of this year averaged slightly higher than its first quarter level,
but was unchanged from the final quarter of 1981. Unemployment rose
further in the summer, and inflation appears to be slowing. The slow
pace of domestic activity contributed to modest import demand and a
trade surplus of $2.4 billion for the first half of the year. In re-
sponse to declines in interest rates at home and abroad, the Netherlands
Bank lowered its discount rate one percentage point to 7 percent on
August 27.
