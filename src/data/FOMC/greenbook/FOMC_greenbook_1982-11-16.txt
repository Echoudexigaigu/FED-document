 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity remained weak in October, as both employment and
industrial production continued to decline. Slow income growth has
limited the gains in consumer spending; business capital outlays remain
depressed; and despite extensive liquidation, inventories are still high
relative to the current sales pace. Housing activity, however, has
continued to improve; starts and new home sales rose in September. Both
labor costs and prices have continued to decelerate.
Employment and Industrial Production
Nonfarm payroll employment fell 265,000 in October, slightly more
than the average declines over the previous four months, with cutbacks
widespread. In the manufacturing sector, employment fell an additional
230,000; the largest job losses occurred in metals, machinery, and trans-
portation equipment--industries that are still struggling to bring produc-
tion and inventories into line with weak sales. The factory workweek
remained at an extremely low level in October after sharp declines in
both August and September. Sizable reductions in employment also continued
in mining and construction, and employment in retail trade declined for
the third consecutive month as stores failed to hire the usual number of
workers in anticipation of the seasonal pickup in sales.
The unemployment rate climbed a further three-tenths of a percentage
point in October to 10.4 percent. Most of the recent rise in joblessness
has been among workers who normally have a strong attachment to the labor
force. The rate for adult men now stands at 8.5 percent, exceeding the
1975 peak by 2-1/2 percentage points.

Because a long period of economic slack has discouraged jobseeking,
labor force participation rates have shown little net change over the
past year. As a result, labor force entrants and reentrants have accounted
for only a small portion of the increase in total joblessness; in con-
trast, the number of job losers has risen substantially in the past year
and was still increasing rapidly in October. This is broadly consistent
with the persistently high level of new claims for unemployment insurance
and further reports of plant shutdowns. At the same time, with little
rehiring, joblessness has lengthened for workers laid off earlier in the
recession.
Industrial production in October is expected to fall somewhat more
than September's 0.6 percent decline, as hours worked in manufacturing
and mining dropped sharply. Auto assemblies were reduced 15 percent to
a 4.7 million unit annual rate, and weekly data suggest that raw steel
production dropped an additional 2 percent in October. Production of
business equipment continued to drop, although for oil-well drilling the
decline was smaller than in recent months.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing fell 0.5 of a percentage point
in September to 69.1 percent and likely dropped below its 1975 low of
69.0 percent in October. Declines have been even more pronounced for
materials producers whose capacity utilization stood at 67.6 percent in
September--nearly 2 percentage points below its 1975 trough. The operating
rate for raw steel appears to have declined to about 41 percent in October,
a far deeper contraction than in the 1973-75 recession.

Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Personal income gains slowed in August and September and undoubtedly
remained weak in October, reflecting additional job losses and a continued
moderation in wage increases. Nominal wage and salary disbursements, which
make up about 60 percent of personal income, were unchanged in August and
September after growing at a 4 percent annual rate in the second quarter; in
October, private wage and salary disbursements were probably unchanged or
lower. Without the mid-year tax cut and a July cost-of-living increase for
social security recipients, nominal disposable income would have increased
only slightly in the third quarter, and real disposable income would have
declined. In addition, a longer extended benefits program for unemployment
insurance began in September, further offsetting some of the weakness in
labor income.
The income gains that did occur in the third quarter appear to have
been rapidly incorporated into consumers' spending, as the rise in personal
outlays from June to September just matched the gains in disposable income.
As a result, the personal saving rate, which increased to 7.5 percent in July,
fell back in September to 6.4 percent, less than the second-quarter average.
Personal consumption expenditures, in 1972 dollars, rose moderately
in the third quarter, but the gains were mainly confined to the service
sector and to some nondurable goods industries. Real spending for consumer
durables declined for the quarter as a whole, following moderate increases
in the first half of 1982. Moreover, broad indicators of spending were
still weak as the quarter ended; excluding the automotive group and those
stores selling mainly nonconsumer goods, nominal retail sales were up
just 0.4 percent in September. (October retail sales figures, to be
released November 10, will be reported in the Supplement.)

II-8
Domestic auto sales increased to a 6.2 million unit annual rate in
September, in response to special promotions aimed at reducing excessive
inventories of 1982 models. However, with the end of many promotions,
the sales of domestically produced units fell back to a 5.3 million unit
annual rate in October. To encourage further clearance of 1982 models
several producers have announced reductions in auto finance rates, as well
as rebates, beginning in November. Sales of imported autos remained
steady through the third quarter at a 2.2 million unit annual rate.
Business Fixed Investment
Capital spending continued to fall during the summer, and there
appears little prospect of an upturn any time soon. Real business fixed
investment dropped at a 13 percent annual rate in the third quarter;
equipment spending declined substantially and spending on structures also
fell following small gains through the first half of 1982. Spending for
construction of offices and institutional buildings continued to increase,
but those gains probably reflect commitments made some time ago.
Recent commitments data suggest further reductions in capital
spending in the months ahead. Nondefense capital goods orders have been
trending down for more than a year, and although orders increased in
September, they were still 10-1/2 percent below shipments; the backlog
of unfilled equipment orders therefore continued to dwindle. In addition,
the volume of new construction contracts has not been sufficient to main-
tain building activity at recent levels. In the third quarter, contracts
for commercial and industrial building were 35 percent below the peak
year of 1979 and permits for nonresidential building (in current dollars)
were down 22 percent from the 1979 average.

Early indications of capital spending for 1983 are not promising.
The McGraw-Hill survey of plant and equipment spending, taken in September
and October, reported that businesses plan to reduce capital outlays by
2.1 percent in 1983 and expect inflation in capital goods prices to be 7
percent, thereby implying a reduction of 9 percent in real terms. Reduc-
tions in spending plans were widespread for both the manufacturing and
nonmanufacturing sectors. Despite substantial differences by industry,
the Merrill Lynch survey of capital spending plans reported an almost
identical 1.7 percent decline in nominal spending for 1983. Although
the direction of capital spending indicated by these surveys is consistent
with other indicators, the precise results should be viewed with caution;
since 1970, the absolute size of the errors of these two surveys has, on
average, exceeded 3 percentage points.
Residential construction
Housing starts have been trending upward this year as mortgage
interest rates have declined, but the upswing has continued to be less
pronounced than in most previous housing recoveries. In September,
private housing starts rebounded from an August decline, bringing starts
in the third quarter to a 1.1 million unit annual rate, up 17 percent
from the previous quarter.
The third-quarter increase in starts occurred largely in the multi-
family sector and was mainly attributable to a surge in federally sub-
sidized rental units at the end of the fiscal year. However, starts of
unsubsidized multifamily units--including condominiums and cooperatives--
also appear to have picked up somewhat in the third quarter; two develop-
ments encouraging increased activity in this market are that the average

vacancy rate for rental units has remained low by historical standards
and rents have apparently been rising faster than either residential
construction costs or average prices of new homes. Starts of single-
family homes increased almost 7 percent in September, and newly-issued
permits for single-family units rose 16 percent, representing a continua-
tion of the gradual uptrend since late 1981 for both series.
A September advance in new home sales--24 percent over the August
pace--lifted sales above the 1981 average for the first time this year
and led to a further reduction in the stock of unsold new homes. Given
the low level of stocks, a sustained upturn in sales could translate
fairly quickly into additional strengthening of new home construction.
In contrast, sales of existing homes remain a weak factor in the housing
recovery, staying unchanged in September from the new cyclical low set
in August.
Inventory Investment
Production cutbacks have trimmed business inventories to their pre-
recession levels, but because of weak sales, inventory-sales ratios at
the end of September were still high in many sectors of the economy.
In manufacturing, the book value of inventories declined at an
annual rate of $7.4 billion in August and $25.8 billion in September,
with about two-thirds of the liquidation among nondurables. However,
shipments fell in both months, and book value inventory-sales ratios at
the end of the third quarter were no lower than at the beginning of the
summer. Ratios remained particularly high at several durable goods indus-
tries including primary metals, nonelectrical machinery, and transporta-
tion equipment.

Retail trade inventories rose very rapidly in August, with the bulk
of the advance concentrated in the auto sector. In response to the build-
up in auto inventories, the industry implemented dealer incentive programs
in September and reduced fourth quarter production schedules. As a result,
the level of dealer inventories declined in September and was reduced
further in October as production was even lower than the depressed level
of sales.
Inventory imbalances also appeared to prevail at many nonauto retail
outlets in late summer. In August, the inventory-sales ratio for nonauto
retail stores as a whole was almost back to its January peak. Liquidation
seemed to have stalled at stores in the GAF grouping during the summer
and, as real sales at these stores remained flat in September, their inven-
tory overhang may well have continued undiminished.
For the third quarter as a whole, preliminary GNP estimates, based
on partial data, showed a slight increase in constant dollar manufacturing
and trade inventories. However, with more complete inventory data now
available it appears that the preliminary inventory estimate will be
revised down. As was true in the first half of 1982, third-quarter data
on industrial production and physical stocks imply a faster rate of inven-
tory liquidation than shown in the GNP accounts.
Government Spending
Federal expenditures, on a NIPA basis, increased at a 20 percent
annual rate in the third quarter. In part, spending was boosted by
rising defense outlays and by the July COLA in social security benefits.
In addition, rising joblessness triggered increases in unemployment
compensation payments, and low agricultural prices prompted a resumption

II-16
of high outlays by the Commodity Credit Corporation. Net interest payments
also rose sharply in response to the widening deficit. On the receipts
side of the budget, personal tax payments declined because of slow income
growth and the July cut in withholding taxes.
For the 1982 fiscal year as a whole, federal outlays on a unified
basis totaled $728 billion. The increase in outlays--at 10.8 percent--
was below the rate of growth in preceding years. Spending for defense was
17 percent greater than in the previous fiscal year. There was, however,
a marked slowing in the growth rate of spending in the human resources
category, owing primarily to cuts in employment and training programs and
in grants for public assistance and medicaid.
Federal receipts--at $618 billion--increased only 3.1 percent in
FY1982, substantially below the pace recorded in recent years. The growth
of personal and corporate income taxes was cut by last year's tax reduc-
tions, the slow growth of personal income, and declines in corporate
profits. Excise taxes declined primarily due to the effect of lower oil
prices on the windfall profits tax. The federal deficit was a record
$110.7 billion.
State and local governments continued to trim outlays in the third
quarter; spending, in real terms, fell at a 0.7 percent annual rate.
The decline was entirely in the labor compensation category, and reflected
a sharp cutback in state and local government employment. Preliminary
data showed employment up 33,000 in October, but still 166,000 below
October of 1981. In contrast, real construction spending rose a little
in the third quarter, but remains weak, having fallen 14 percent in real
terms over the past two years.

II-18
Wages and Prices
A wide variety of labor cost measures suggest that wage inflation
has slowed about 2-1/2 percentage points in 1982. While some slowing
was evident in the unionized blue collar sector as early as 1981, the
employment cost index shows that the deceleration in wages is now affecting
white-collar and service workers as well. The most up-to-date wage measure,
the hourly earnings index for production workers, shows a 6.0 percent annual
rate of wage increase over the first 10 months of 1982--down 2-1/2 per-
centage points from last year. In the unionized sector, relatively rapid
wage increases are still being passed through from older agreements, but
new settlements and smaller COLAs have lowered the average rise in wages
by about 3 percentage points from that of 1981. New settlements have taken
on increased importance in this heavy bargaining year, and, in 1982, have
averaged 3 percentage points less than when these same parties last
bargained.
Hourly compensation, a more comprehensive labor cost measure
includes fringe benefits, has also slowed considerably in 1982. 0
the first three quarters of the year, compensation rose at a 6-3/4 per-
cent annual rate, 2 percentage points less than in 1981. As a result of
the slowdown in compensation and recent increases in productivity, unit
labor costs have risen just over 5 percent at an annual rate thus far
this year; this is considerably below the 8.9 percent advance in 1981.
As the slowdown in wage increases has become more pervasive this
year, the easing of price inflation has become more durable and broadly-
based than in 1981. By most measures, prices increased at an annual

rate of 5 percent or less over the first nine months of the year. In
September the consumer price index rose 0.2 percent, benefitting from
lower homeownership costs and relatively small increases for most other
items; the experimental CPI, which uses rents as a measure of homeowner-
ship costs, rose 0.5 percent and has increased at a 5 percent annual rate
so far this year. Prices for producer finished goods declined in September.
Inflation in the food and energy sectors was relatively mild again
in September. Food prices increased 0.5 percent following declines in
both July and August; excluding the food items that are volatile from
month to month--fruits and vegetables and meats--the increase in food
prices was 0.3 percent in September, near the 1982 average monthly rise.
In the energy sector, gasoline prices declined for the second consecutive
month, partially offsetting the effect of the ongoing decontrol of natural
gas prices that boosted these prices 20 percent in the 12 months ended in
September.
Homeownership costs declined sharply in September, reflecting a
drop in home prices and steep declines in mortgage rates. The CPI
measure of mortgage rates has been trending down all year, and the lower-
ing of FHA/VA ceiling rates from 15 to 14 percent in early September
pushed the index down further. The recent data on settlement and commit-
ment rates, as well as a further reduction in the FHA/VA ceiling during
October suggest that the mortgage rate index will depress monthly increases
in the overall CPI for the remainder of the year.

II-22
Excluding food, energy, and homeownership, consumer prices again
rose less than 0.5 percent in September. Price increases were small
for most commodities and even in the service sector, where inflation
has been a bit higher, price increases remained well below last year's
double-digit rates. Notable exceptions have been sharp price increases
for hospital services, tuition costs, tobacco products, and used cars.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
As expected, deposit flows were distorted in October by the matura-
tion of more than $30 billion of all savers certificates. Although depos-
itory institutions have thus far retained most of the maturing funds,
large amounts have shifted into various highly liquid accounts. As a
result, M1 has continued to surge, recording in October its third straight
double-digit advance. Growth in M2 and M3 picked up from the relatively
sluggish September rates, but remained below the brisk pace of earlier in
the year.
Security market developments since the October FOMC meeting have
reflected the continuing weakness of the economy, an accommodative reserve
supplying posture by the System, and a widespread view that the Federal
Reserve would for a while be pursuing a less "monetarist" course aimed at
easing credit conditions to promote an economic recovery. The federal
funds rate has declined more than 1-1/4 percentage points, reflecting a
1/2 point cut in the discount rate and some easing in reserve positions.
Other private short-term interest rates have fallen 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 per-
centage points, while declines in Treasury bills have been much less. As
interest rates have dropped, concerns about major financial dislocations
have diminished; quality spreads in the money markets have narrowed, and
tiering within rating categories in domestic and Euro-CD markets report-
edly has become less pronounced. In the long-term capital markets, tax-
able long-term bond yields have fallen about 1-1/4 percentage points, and
common stocks have appreciated around 18 to 22 percent, with many indexes
touching new highs in early November.

WEEKLY DATA

III-3
The rally in the bond markets has brought a surge in corporate offer-
ings. A good part of the proceeds of these bond issues has been used to
repay short-term debt; commercial paper has contracted, and borrowing from
banks has moderated. Tax-exempt borrowers, too, have responded to lower
interest rates, offering a record volume of bond issues. Treasury borrow-
ing in October was on the light side because of the acceleration of offer-
ings in late September; however, in November the Treasury has had to return
to the task of financing the government's massive deficit. Household bor-
rowing in the mortgage and consumer installment credit markets remains
depressed, but there are signs of an uptick in mortgage activity.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Available data indicate that only a small fraction of maturing all
savers certificate (ASC) funds have been rolled over into new certificates.
Much of the remainder appears to have been shifted into demand deposits,
OCDs, and savings accounts. Although households likely have placed the
funds in such liquid accounts only temporarily, there is as yet no sign of
a reallocation of assets. The sharp decline of market interest rates in
recent months not only has reduced the opportunity cost of holding the
more liquid instruments, but evidently has left many savers uncertain about
what investment decisions to make. Reflecting these circumstances, and
perhaps the record volume of stock market activity, M1 surged at nearly a
20 percent rate of growth in October (somewhat less with the new experimen-
tal seasonal factors).
M2 advanced at an 8 percent annual rate in October, up from 4-3/4
percent in September. Part of the acceleration in M2 reflected a pickup
in growth of its nontransactions component. Within this category, a

resurgence of overnight RPs at large banks, which accompanied a sizable
buildup in Treasury security holdings, more than offset slower growth in
the total savings and small time deposit component and smaller inflows to
general purpose and broker/dealer money funds. As ASCs matured, small
time deposits contracted, while savings deposits registered record inflows.
Although some maturing funds likely were shifted out of M2, available evi-
dence suggests that such shifts have been quite moderate: non-M2 invest-
ments thought to be attractive outlets for maturing ASC funds--tax-exempt
mutual funds and unit investment trusts as well as noncompetitive tenders
for Treasury securities--showed little, if any, step-up in flows last month.
M3 also grew more rapidly in October than in September, owing not
only to stronger M2 but also to a resumption of commercial bank issuance
of large CDs, increased CD growth at thrifts, and an abatement in runoffs
of term RPs. The turnaround in commercial bank issuance of large CDs was
accompanied by a narrowing of spreads of bank CD rates over Treasury bill
yields and reportedly less tiering of domestic and Euro-CD rates, including
a reduction in premiums paid by certain institutions with widely publicized
problem loans. In reaction to earlier funding difficulties, these banks
reportedly had become more restrictive in their lending practices; by late
September, loan portfolios at these institutions had weakened noticeably
relative to those of other large banks, as some customers switched to other
institutions for loans as well as standby letters of credit to back commer-
cial paper. During October, one of these institutions recovered some of
its standing in the market and resumed lending, while lending at the other
publicized institutions continued to be sluggish.

Bank credit in the aggregate expanded at a somewhat faster pace in
October than in the previous month, reflecting primarily sizable acquisi-
tions of Treasury securities for investment accounts. The buildup of Trea-
sury securities was the largest since January of this year and occurred
mainly at large banks, which acquired mostly one- to five-year maturities.
Business loan growth slowed in October, especially at large banks, whose
customers probably shifted some of their financing to the bond market.
Real estate and consumer loans at commercial banks remained weak. Security
loans continued to grow rapidly, likely reflecting the brisk pace of under-
writing and trading activity in the capital markets.
Business Finance
Preliminary data indicate that a modest improvement in profits did
little to ease corporate financing needs in the third quarter, as capital
expenditures continued to exceed internally generated funds by a consider-
able margin. Consequently, total external financing by nonfinancial cor-
porations during the third quarter likely remained close to the high levels
recorded in the first half of 1982. Available data, however, suggest that
total funds raised by businesses in debt and equity markets have ebbed thus
far in the current quarter.
Continuing the trend that emerged in the summer, corporate financing
in October appears to have been concentrated in bond markets; $6.6 billion
in publicly offered bonds were sold in October, the largest monthly slate
since November 1981, and issuance of Euro-bonds by U.S. firms remained
strong. Declining long-term interest rates have encouraged many firms to
fund short-term indebtedness, as nonfinancial corporations paid down even

larger amounts of commercial paper in October than in September and non-
merger related borrowings at banks contracted.
Industrial corporations accounted for about 40 percent of gross bond
issuance in October, close to their share in the third quarter and roughly
twice their share in the first half of the year. The major part of the
October volume consisted of straight debt issues rated Baa or above. As
interest rates have fallen, firms with good credit ratings apparently have
felt little need to employ the innovative or "gimmicky" financing techniques
used extensively in the first half of the year. A substantial fraction of
bond issuance by lower-rated firms took the form of convertible debentures.
The rally in share prices elicited only a moderately increased gross
volume of stock issues in October. In early November, however, there has
been a noticeable increase in the volume of new stock registrations, and
most market analysts expect a near-term pickup in equity issuance, barring
a major reversal of the recent price gains. Thus far, many firms reportedly
have taken advantage of improved share prices by funding pension liabilities
with issuance of new stock to their own pension plans (not included in gross
offerings).1
Government Finance
Federal Sector. A record $61.7 billion combined Treasury deficit
is projected by the Board staff for the fourth quarter. Of this amount,
the staff estimates that $49 billion will be financed through marketable
1. These transactions do not involve a transfer of cash between the parent
company and the pension fund; stock is issued by the former to the latter
and becomes an asset of the pension fund with no corresponding reduction
in cash or increase in liabilities. Under Section 407 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a defined benefit pension plan can
hold up to 10 percent of its total assets in the form of stock or other
marketable securities issued by the parent company.

borrowings,1 with the remainder financed largely by a reduction in the Trea-
sury's cash balance.
Through mid-November, the Treasury has raised $26 billion of its
fourth-quarter needs, comprising $14.4 billion in bills and $11.6 billion
in coupons. In its mid-quarter refunding, the Treasury raised $8.4 billion
(net) from the sale of 3- and 10-year notes and a 30-year bond. To increase
bidding interest for longer-term issues not sold at the mid-quarter refund-
ing, the Treasury announced that in early December it will hold another
"mini-refunding" by compressing the auction dates of 4- and 7-year notes
and the 20-year bond into three consecutive days; in earlier years the 7-
year note and 20-year bond had been auctioned later in December or in early
January.
Federally sponsored credit agencies repaid about $200 million in debt
in October. Owing to a fall-off in net mortgage purchases and unusually
high liquid balances at the end of September, FNMA--which had borrowed sub-
stantial amounts in previous months--paid down about $200 million in October.
The Farm Credit Banks raised less than $100 million, while the Federal Home
Loan Banks trimmed their outstanding debt slightly as thrift institutions
repaid advances for the fourth consecutive month. In recent months, the
FHLBs had built up liquidity in anticipation of large demands for advances
to offset outflows related to maturing ASCs. With these outflows proving
less than feared, the FHLBs are expected to satisfy a substantial part of
their financing needs over the next few months by drawing down their liquid
assets.
1. This borrowing projection is above the Treasury's estimate of $46.5
billion.

State and Local Sector. Yields quoted in the long-term municipal
securities market dropped as much as 125 basis points immediately follow-
ing the October FOMC meeting, but backed up late in the month as investors
resisted the aggressive pricing by underwriters on a flood of new bond
issues. Last week, the Bond Buyer index of rates on general obligation
bonds stood at 9.96 percent, about 50 basis points below its October FOMC
level; the index of rates on revenue bonds--at 10.66 percent--declined
about 30 basis points.

of tax-exempt commercial paper.
The gross volume of municipal bond offerings was a record $7.9 bil-
lion in October, and the November volume is expected to be almost as large.1
Apart from the attraction of lower rates, some of the recent pickup in tax-
exempt bond issuance may reflect issuers' desires to market bonds before

bonds totaled $56 billion (NSA), already $8 billion above the record
annual volume sold in 1978.

January 1, the effective date of a new federal law requiring registration
of all municipal securities maturing in one year or more. Revenue bonds
continued to make up the bulk of tax-exempt offerings, accounting for
nearly 75 percent of such issuance in October. Sales of mortgage revenue
bonds amounted to $1.4 billion, approximately the average pace of recent
months.
As has been true for most of the year, individuals remain the major
purchasers of new tax-exempt issues, either through direct investment or
indirectly through bond funds. Traditional institutional investors--pro-
perty and casualty insurance companies and commercial banks--remain, for
the most part, on the sidelines. Record underwriting losses of property
and casualty insurance companies are expected to continue until late 1983,
and prospects for significant tax-exempt investments by these institutions
therefore remain dim. Commercial banks, on the other hand, have an incen-
tive to increase purchases of municipal securities before December 31; only
85 percent of the interest expenses and other carrying costs of municipal
securities purchased after this date, rather than the current 100 percent,
will be deductible by these institutions for federal income tax purposes.
Mortgage Markets
The average interest rate on new commitments for fixed-rate, level-
payment conventional home mortgages at S&Ls has declined by more than a
percentage point since the October FOMC meeting to 13.91 percent, the low-
est reading since October 1980. Falling rates on GNMA-guaranteed securi-
ties prompted a cut of a full percentage point, on October 13, in the ceil-
ing rate for FHA/VA home loans to 12-1/2 percent, the lowest level since
August 1980. Average effective rates on level-payment loans and graduated-

III-14
payment FHA-insured home loans currently are around 12.9 percent and 13.2
percent, respectively.
In the secondary market, yields on FNMA and FHLMC commitments to
acquire fixed- and adjustable-rate home loans generally have fallen by a
percentage point or more since early October. Gross yields available on
fixed-rate conventional home loans through mandatory delivery purchase
programs of these two agencies recently have been around 13-1/2 percent.
As mortgage rates have receded in recent months, the volume of resi-
dential lending activity appears to have begun to pick up. Issuance of
new commitments by S&Ls increased slightly in September for the second
straight month, rising somewhat above the range that had prevailed since
late last year. In addition, HUD surveys of large mortgage companies--
available through October--suggest that demands for conventional and govern-
ment underwritten home mortgage credit have been strengthening.1 HUD also
reports that applications for FHA home mortgage insurance increased substan-
tially during the September-October period. As yet, it is unclear how much
of the above activity reflects financing of home purchases and how much is
refinancing of outstanding higher-rate or short-term loans.
Reflecting slack commitment activity during previous months, mortgage
assets held by S&Ls rose only $900 million in September, as a $3 billion
increase in holdings of pass-through securities more than offset a near-
record $2.1 billion reduction in directly held mortgage loans. This shift
in portfolio composition reflected primarily swaps of conventional home
loans for pass-through securities guaranteed by FHLMC or FNMA.
1. These surveys also suggest some shift in borrower demands away from
adjustable-rate to fixed-rate contracts as interest rates have dropped.

III-15
Swap transactions continued to dominate the mortgage securities
activity of FNMA and FHLMC in September, accounting for 95 percent of all
new issues guaranteed by these agencies. Mortgages held in portfolio by
FNMA increased by more than $1 billion for the fourth consecutive month;
in contrast, the mortgage portfolios of both FHLMC and GNMA have changed
little, on balance, throughout the year.
The delinquency rate on mortgages held by federally insured S&Ls
(dollar volume of loans delinquent 60 days or longer, as a percent of
total amount outstanding) increased to a record 2.02 percent (SA) in
September, more than double the rate at the cyclical low in the second
half of 1979. This deterioration likely mirrors slack overall economic
activity and weakening home prices. To date, the maturation of balloon
second mortgages appears not to have caused widespread problems for home-
owners.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit edged up in September to an
annual rate of 4 percent after virtually no gain in August. For the third
quarter as a whole, consumer credit increased at only a 2 percent annual
rate, down from the 4-3/4 percent pace of the second quarter.
Recent decreases in the cost of funds to commercial banks apparently
are beginning to carry over into lower interest rates on consumer loans.
According to the Board series, auto loan interest rates at banks averaged
17.08 percent in the first week of August. Although the next observation
(covering the first week of November) is not yet available, an informal
survey of several banks around the country indicates that interest rates

for auto loans have declined 150 to 200 basis points since August.1 Still,
the spread between the finance rate at banks and the yield on 90-day bank
CDs has remained on the large side by historical standards.
Both the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the Ford Motor
Credit Company have recently established low-rate (10.9 percent) financing
programs for purchases of remaining 1982 models. Prior to these programs,
loan rates at auto finance companies averaged close to 18 percent on 1982
cars (and still do on 1983 models). The rate-subsidy programs are expected
to reduce typical monthly payments by $28 to $35 (on a 48-month loan in the
$8,000 to $10,000 range). In contrast, the estimated decline in finance
rates at banks likely would reduce monthly payments only about $6 to $10 on
average.
1. Interest rates on unsecured loans appear to have fallen by somewhat
smaller amounts.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown by the chart on the next page, the weighted average
value of the dollar has appreciated by about 1 percent on balance since
the October FOMC meeting. Dollar interest rates have declined somewhat
more than foreign-currency interest rates on average since the FOMC
meeting, but any depressing effects on dollar exchange rates may
have been countered by growing expectations that foreign interest
rates will continue to decline as a policy response to the continuing
weakness of economic activity abroad. The announcement that September
data had resulted in a U.S. third-quarter trade deficit of $52 billion
(annual rate) had little apparent impact on exchange rates. On a
bilateral basis the dollar has appreciated by more than 1 percent
since early October against most European currencies, while depre-
ciating by several percent against the yen and the Canadian dollar.
.The United States inter-
vened on three days in early October, selling less than $100 million
total against yen and marks.
Pressures on the
lira were attributed to increasing market concerns about Italy's
large public borrowing requirements and about the prospect of major
strikes if labor and employer groups are unsuccessful in renegotiating
the scala-mobile wage-indexation arrangement, which expires at the

end of January.
The weakening of the
yen appeared to have been associated with the sluggishness of Japanese
exports and domestic activity, and with domestic political strains
over the selection of a new leader for the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party. Early in November market sentiment toward the yen reversed
for reasons that are not clear, and the yen appreciated sharply to a
dollar value about 2 percent higher than its level at the time of the
last FOMC.
The Swedish krona was devalued by 16 percent in early October
following the transition to the new Socialist government. Around
the same time Finland devalued its currency by 10 percent in two

In early November the Mexican authorities acted to ease the
particularly-severe economic dislocations that have occurred in border
areas by permitting the opening of special exchange houses in cities
bordering the United States. These houses must observe limits on
dollar sales to individuals and must not be net sellers of dollars
to all customers combined.

IV-4
Bank lending to Latin America and Eastern Europe. The Mexican debt
problem, on top of large arrears on Argentina's external debt, has helped
bring on a sharply reduced flow of credit for Latin American borrowers.
Collectively, this shift by banks toward caution increases the risk that
additional countries will encounter difficulties in servicing their
external debts. Another major international banking "troublespot" is
Eastern Europe, where a two-year decline in new medium-term lending set in
motion by the Polish and Romanian debt problems may yet force other
countries to reschedule their external debts.
The stock of claims of U.S. and other international banks on Latin
America and Eastern Europe in June 1982 is shown in the top of the table
on the next page. U.S. bank claims on Latin America were $75 billion of
which more than one-half were claims on Mexico and Brazil alone. U.S.
banks' claims on Latin America were 18 percent of their total claims on
foreigners, while for non-U.S. banks, with $120 billion of claims on Latin
America in June, this percentage was 10 percent (including claims on U.S.
borrowers). Claims on Eastern Europe were smaller than on Latin America
for both groups of banks, amounting to only 1-1/2 percent of total foreign
claims for U.S. banks and 5 percent for non-U.S. banks.
The volume of new medium-term Eurocredits arranged by Latin American
borrowers -- shown in the lower part of the table -- declined to only $4.3
billion in the third quarter of 1982, one-half the quarterly rate in the
first half of this year and also well down from the year-earlier level.
The largest reduction was for Mexico, which was unable to borrow after
mid-August. Argentina had already been closed out of the market since
April. Brazilian borrowing declined in the third quarter. Negotiated

credits for Latin America continued low in October, amounting to only
about $1 billion. New Eurocredits for Eastern Europe in the first nine
months of 1982 were only one-third the 1980 rate and one-half the 1981
rate, and were exclusively to Yugoslavia (second quarter) and Hungary
(September).
In Latin America, negotiations between Mexico and creditor banks on
principal repayments of public sector debt and the possibility of new
credits are currently marking time pending conclusion of an adjustment
program supported by the IMF, which is expected shortly. Drawings on the
IMF would be almost $4 billion over three years. Argentina has held talks
with 10 large (mostly U.S.) banks on a $1.1 billion short-term loan and is
seeking $750 million of short-term official assistance from the BIS. The
purpose of this proposed financing, likewise contingent on agreement on an
adjustment program with the IMF, is to clean up about $1.8 billion of debt
arrears, and this financing would be additional to Argentina's need to
roll over or refinance nearly $4 billion of debt falling due in November-
December. The proposed bridge financing would be intended to tide
Argentina over until it can (1) draw on the IMF ($800 million in January
1983 and perhaps a further $1.2 billion by March 1984); (2) reduce its
current-account deficit from about $2 billion in 1982 to a planned $1/2
billion or less in 1983; and (3) get past the bunching of newly maturing
debts over the next few months.
Brazil found it more difficult to borrow in September and October.
Brazil's large current account deficit (estimated at $14 billion for 1982)
and low level of reserves have led to the adoption of tighter domestic
monetary conditions and intensified restrictions on imports in September,

IV-7
and the introduction of an exchange risk guarantee system to encourage the
private sector to seek foreign loans. In October the Brazilian
authorities decided to take restrictive fiscal measures and to try to
reduce the current-account deficit to $7 billion next year, partly by
further slashing imports.
Chile, facing large maturing short-term debts, is completing
negotiatons for a standby credit of $860 million from the IMF, and expects
some further improvement in its current account balance in 1983.
Venezuela does not face a debt repayment problem, but is trying to
refinance at longer term a substantial portion of its $8.8 billion of
short-term public-sector external debt. To do this it has recognized the
need to pay higher spreads than it was previously willing to pay.
Refinancing of $2.5-3.0 billion of short-term debt due by April 1983
commenced in October.

IV-8
U.S. International Financial Transactions.
Over the period from July to early October the increased uncer-
tainty in financial markets, particularly in the market for bank-
related commercial paper and Euro-CDs, led to a fall in both domestic
and foreign investor demand for these particular bank liabilities,
thereby altering the funding practices of the nine largest U.S. banks.
The changed funding environment appears to have prompted a large net
placement of funds by domestic offices in foreign branches.
U.S. banking offices (including IBFs) made net advances of $8
billion to their own foreign offices between July and October, as shown
in line 1(a) below. Over eighty percent of this large outflow was
reported by U.S. chartered banks (see line 1(b) below), and approxi-

mately fifty percent of this outflow took place at the nine major money
center banks (see line 1 of the Table on the Positions of U.S.
Chartered Banks). U.S. regional banks, which had made net advances of
over $4 billion to their own foreign offices in the first seven months
of the year, contributed an additional $2.5 billion in the July-October
period (see line 3 of the Table on the Positions of U.S. Chartered
Banks).
The outflow of funds from the nine largest U.S. banks appears, in
part, to reflect the problems their affiliated holding companies have
had in issuing commercial paper, and the difficulties that their
foreign branches had experienced in issuing Euro CDs during the summer
months. Holding companies are an important source of deposits for the
Caribbean branches of these banks. Proceeds from domestic commercial
paper sales made by the holding companies are normally deposited in
these branches, rather than at U.S. offices, because Eurodollar
deposits are not subject to reserve requirements. In part because of
investor concern about bank credit quality, outstanding commercial

paper issued by the affiliated holding companies of these nine banks
declined by $4.2 billion between July and mid-October. As outstanding
paper matured and was not rolled over, the holding companies responded
by withdrawing their deposits in their affiliated foreign branches.
Data for the period from July through the end of September indicate
that such deposits declined from $13.4 billion to $11.2 billion.
Another important source of funds for foreign branches of U.S.
banks is the London market for negotiable CDs. Recent evidence based
on interviews with particular banks within the top nine indicate that a
few of these banks had difficulties in issuing Euro-CD's during the
summer months and were subject to tiering in the Euro-CD market. Over
the period from July to September CDs outstanding at London branches of
U.S. banks fell by about $2 billion. That decline, in conjunction with
the fall in the commercial paper issued by the holding companies of the
nine large banks, may have induced the direct funding of foreign
offices by domestic offices. In the later half of October the problems
experienced by some banks in issuing Euro-CDs and commercial paper
eased, perhaps explaining the large inflow of funds from foreign
offices to domestic offices within the last two weeks of October.
Recent evidence suggests that foreign investors' net purchases of
dollar-denominated assets both in the United States and in the Eurobond
market have increased since mid-summer. This increase may reflect two
factors. First, private foreign investors may have come to view
dollar-denominated assets as a "safe haven" for their funds. Second,
these foreign investors may be buying dollar-denominated assets

IV-11
(particularly Treasury bonds and Eurobonds) expecting that the dollar
will remain strong and that U.S. interest rates will fall, yielding
capital gains on their assets. Data so far available for September
indicate net purchases of Treasury bonds and notes by private
foreigners amounting to $2 billion, after only $0.5 billion in net
purchases in August. (See line 3 in the Summary Table of U.S.
International Transactions.) U.S. corporations issued $2.9 billion of
Eurobonds between August and mid-October, an increase in such issues
over the months of June and July. Overall, net foreign private
purchases of both short and long term Treasury obligations and U.S.
corporate securities were about $3 billion in September.
Foreign official holdings of the G-10 countries and Switzerland
increased by only $0.2 billion (line 4a in the Summary Table of U.S.
International Transactions) in August,
.OPEC holdings decreased by $0.7
billion. Partial data, based on foreign official holdings of major
industralized countries at the FRBNY, indicate no appreciable change
from the beginning of September to mid-October.
.Finally, OPEC official
holdings at the FRBNY increased by $1.7 billion from September to mid-
October.

U.S. Merchandise Trade. In September the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit was considerably smaller than the very large August deficit.
For the third quarter as a whole, the trade deficit was more than twice
the size of the deficit in the second quarter. Third-quarter exports
declined by 6 percent, making the sixth consecutive quarterly decline;
imports rose 7 percent from the second-quarter rate.
A drop in agricultural exports accounted for two-thirds of the
total decrease in exports in the third quarter. Export prices weakened
throughout the quarter in response to good crops world-wide and
sluggish demand; in addition some traditional purchasers of U.S. wheat
and corn turned to other suppliers who offered either lower prices or
easier credit terms. There were substantial declines in the volume of
wheat and corn exports.

IV-14
Nonagricultural exports continue to be adversely affected by
sluggish demand from major trading partners and the current and lagged
effects of the decreasing price competitiveness of U.S. goods caused by
the appreciation of the dollar. Between the fourth quarter of 1980 and
the third quarter of 1982, the dollar appreciated by 35 percent on a
weighted average basis. In the third quarter both the value and the
volume of nonagricultural exports declined, as they have each quarter
since mid-1981. Much of the third-quarter decline was in industrial
supplies (particularly coal and fertilizer) which declined steadily
throughout 1982. Another area of considerable weakness has been
civilian aircraft exports. The volume of machinery exports (one-third
of nonagricultural exports) was little changed during the first three
quarters of the year as steady increases in electrical and electronic
machinery exports offset declines in other types of machinery. By
area, vitually all of the decline in nonagricultural exports in the
third quarter (and since the beginning of the year) was in shipments to
the developing countries (with one-third of that decline to Mexico
alone).
About three-fourths of the rise in imports in the third quarter
was in oil. The volume of third-quarter imports was 5.8 million
barrels per day (mb/d), 20 percent higher than in the second quarter.
While U.S. oil consumption was somewhat lower in the third quarter than
in the second, there was some buildup in crude and product inventories
(on a seasonally adjusted basis) particularly in July and August.

IV-15
Oil import prices were about 70 cents per barrel higher than in the
second quarter, reflecting the lagged impact of an increase in spot
prices during late spring. Since June spot prices for crude oil have
been somewhat lower, and in September import prices declined from
August levels.

The volume of nonoil imports increased in the third quarter as it
has during most quarters during the past year despite U.S. real GNP
declining 1-1/2 percent over the same period (3Q82/3Q82). Nonoil
import prices declined in the third quarter, as they have in 5 of the
past 6 quarters. To a large extent the decline in import prices
reflects effects of the dollar appreciation that began early in 1981.
In value terms, the third-quarter increase was spread among consumer
goods, foods (particularly coffee), industrial supplies (other than
steel), and automotive vehicles and parts imported from Japan and
Europe. Imports of steel dropped sharply in the third quarter at least
in part because of U.S. trade policy actions.

IV -16
Foreign Economic Developments. There continue to be few signs of
a recovery in economic activity in the major foreign industrial econo-
mies. Indeed, available signs point to a further weakening of activity
in the third quarter. Among the six major foreign industrial economies,
only Japan registered any net increase in industrial production in the
three-month period that ended in August. Industrial production regis-
tered particularly notable declines in recent months in Germany and France.
Unemployment rates in the major industrial economies continued a general
upward movement in the third quarter, with Japan again proving the ex-
ception to this pattern. Despite evidence of continued economic weak-
ness, budget proposals, recently outlined in a number of countries, have
indicated in general no shift in policy, reflecting continued widespread
concern with the need to control large budget deficits. On the monetary
front, foreign interest rates eased to varying degrees in part in response
to the downturn in U.S. interest rates.
Price inflation in major foreign countries has continued to moderate
on balance. Compared both to the previous quarter and the corresponding
quarter last year, both consumer and wholesale prices in the third quar-
ter increased more slowly in the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Ger-
many. The sharpest slowing of consumer price inflation in the third quar-
ter was in the United Kingdom and France, the latter situation reflecting
mainly the government-imposed price freeze in effect through October.
The major exceptions to the slowdown in inflation in recent months have
been Japan and Italy. Japanese wholesale price increases accelerated
somewhat in the third quarter -while remaining at a low level absolute-
ly -- due largely to the relative weakness of the yen's exchange rate.

IV -17
Italian consumer price inflation rose in recent months, in part reflec-
ting indirect tax increases, while wholesale prices and wages in Italy
continued the trend of moderation shown over the past year.
The trade and current account positions of several of the major
foreign industrial economies have continued to show significant improve-
ments relative to their positions of last year. Only in France, where a
trade deficit of more than $4 billion (s.a.) was recorded in the third
quarter, has there been significant deterioration in 1982. More repre-
sentative has been the situation in Germany where the cumulative current
account deficit in the first three quarters of 1982 was only $2.4 bil-
lion, down sharply from the $11.6 billion deficit in the corresponding
period of 1981. Despite the shift toward surplus of the major foreign
industrial economies, there remains little evidence of buoyant export
sales which could serve as a stimulus to domestic growth.
Individual Country Notes. Unemployment in Germany was over 2 mil-
lion (s.a.) in October, almost twice the level of unemployment at its
peak during the 1975 recession. The rate of unemployment jumped from
7.9 percent in August to 8.3 percent in October. The industrial pro-
duction index for the three months through September was almost 5 per-
cent below both the corresponding period of last year and the first half
of this year. The latest available surveys of business climate are
pessimistic and bankruptcies are continuing at a very high rate. Con-
sumer price inflation has slowed in recent months, and in August, the
CPI registered its first monthly decline since September 1978. The
annual rate of consumer price inflation for the third quarter was 4.3
percent. A marked deceleration of inflation at the wholesale level in

IV -18
recent months suggests that the slowdown of consumer price inflation
will continue.
The current account showed a deficit of $0.2 billion (n.s.a.) in
September, which brings the cumulative deficit so far this year to $2.4
billion, compared with a deficit of $11.6 billion for the same period
last year. The smaller deficit reflects the strong increase in the
trade surplus, which earlier this year was based both on gains in ex-
port volume and a favorable shift in the terms of trade. In recent
months, however, the volume of exports has been declining faster than
the volume of imports.
Monetary policy has continued to ease. On October 21, the Bundes-
bank reduced both its discount and Lombard rates by one percentage point
to 6 and 7 percent respectively. The growth of Central Bank Money was
near the upper limit of its 4 to 7 percent target range in September.
One month after taking office, the new German government submitted
a supplemental budget for the current year, and a draft budget for 1983.
Both. budgets project larger deficits than had the budgets of the previous
government. The fiscal policy plans of the new conservative government
center around establishing a longer-run trend toward reduction of the
federal deficit, while at the same time providing some short-run counter-
cyclical support to the economy, with emphasis on stimulating investment.
Specific new measures announced so far are: an increase in the VAT from
13 to 14 percent as of July next year, a compulsory interest-free loan
(5 percent of an individual's tax liability) to the government from upper
income earners, decreased unemployment payments, increased private con-
tributions to social insurance, cuts in child benefits, public sector

IV -19
wage restraints, and cuts in education and housing subsidies. These mea-
sures are intended to finance cuts in taxes on business and owner-occu-
pied housing, and subsidies for urban development and newly founded com-
panies.
In the wake of Japanese Premier Suzuki's surprise resignation an-
nouncement, the formulation of a new economic stimulus policy has been
delayed. After declining in the first half of 1982, industrial produc-
tion (s.a.) appears to have turned up in the third quarter. Preliminary
figures for September show all industries posting a 1.1 percent gain in
production over August levels. August leading economic indicators re-
cently released also show improvement in the outlook for production,
shipments and employment.
Trade statistics indicate that exports are unlikely to provide the
stimulus for recovery in the near term. August saw a decline in exports
(s.a.) for the fifth straight month while imports remained level after
eight straight months of decline. September exports rose less than 0.2
percent over August's levels, while imports resumed their decline.
Inflation has risen somewhat in the third quarter. In contrast to
an annualized rate of wholesale price inflation in the first half of 1982
of less than 2 percent (n.s.a.), the third-quarter rate of wholesale price
inflation was over 4 percent. The CPI jumped by more than 2 percent
(n.s.a.) in September after remaining nearly unchanged since the first
quarter. The yen's sharp depreciation in the third quarter caused an
8.5 percent annual rate of increase in import prices and was a major
contributing factor to the rise in the inflation rate.

IV -20
On November 25 a successor to Prime Minister Suzuki as president of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will be chosen. Only later will the
new president be elected prime minister and form a cabinet that can give
formal approval to this fiscal year's supplementary budget and deal with
policy issues for the next fiscal year.
The recovery of real economic activity in the United Kingdom con-
tinues to he weak while the rate of inflation has declined sharply. In-
dustrial production (s.a.) in August was unchanged from both its July
level and its level six months earlier and was only 0.6 percent above
its August 1981 level. The unemployment rate rose slightly in September
and October. The 12.8 percent (s.a.) rate for October was one full per-
centage point above the level in January of this year despite the fact
that the economy has been expanding slightly in real terms.
Consumer prices in September actually declined. The retail price
index in the month n.s.a.) was unchanged from its level three months
earlier and 7.3 percent above its level in September 1981. By comparison,
in January consumer prices were 12 percent above year-earlier levels. In
the three months to October, wholesale prices (n.s.a.) rose at an annual
rate of 6 percent. U.K. coal miners recently voted to reject the union
leadership's recommendation to strike, thereby accepting the National
Coal Board's offer of 8.2 to 9.1 percent wage increases.
The U.K. trade balance returned to surplus in September, and the
trade surplus rose to $1.4 billion (s.a.) for the first three quarters
of the year. The current account surplus increased as well, to $4 bil-
lion (s.a.) for the same period.

IV -21
Nominal interest rates declined further in October in the United
Kingdom. The London clearing banks reduced their base rates in one-half
percentage point steps from 10-1/2 percent at the start of October to 9 per-
cent in early November. Through September, growth of each of the three
aggregates targeted by the Bank of England remained within the 8-12 per-
cent target range.
French economic activity, as measured by both real GDP and industrial
production, rose by one percent (s.a.) in the second quarter of 1982.
Investment was the strongest component, while exports were particularly
weak, declining by 4 percent. In the first two months of the third quar-
ter, however, industrial production fell by over 3 percent from the pre-
vious quarter. September surveys indicate that demand remains weak and
output is not expected to improve in the next several months.
Consumer prices, under the influence of a price freeze, rose at an
annual rate of less than 6 percent in the third quarter compared with an
annual rate over 12 percent in the previous quarter. The freeze was re-
placed at the beginning of this month by a system of controls resulting
from negotiations between government and industry for some sectors,
outright decree for some sectors, and by a reduction in permitted re-
tail margins by 2-3 percent. The goal of the government is to hold
inflation to 10 percent this year and to 8 percent next year.
The continuing deterioration in the French trade balance is a source
of concern to French authorities. Deficits in each of the second and
third quarters of this year were over $4 billion, compared with deficits
under $2 billion in the same quarters of 1981. Exports in the second
quarter were 6 percent below their level in the final quarter of last

IV -22
year. In the past several weeks, the French have announced a tax
break to stimulate exports as well as language and labeling restric-
tions to impede imports. The French intend to commence negotiations
soon with the countries with which they have large bilateral trade def-
icits: the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and Germany.
Italian industrial production (s.a.) fell sharply in August. While
much of this monthly decline appears to represent a recently emerging
seasonal pattern, longer-term comparisons also show sluggish activity,
with industrial production showing no growth from its level of a year
ago and down 5 percent from its level in August 1980. In the three-
month period ending in October, consumer price inflation accelerated,
in part as a result of indirect tax hikes. Wholesale price inflation
has decelerated substantially in the past 12 month period. Part of this
decline is due to the 6 percentage point drop in the rate of wage in-
creases over the past year to about a 16 percent year-over-year increase
in July. Wage negotiations have been temporarily delayed while the scala
mobile is renegotiated. However, when new contracts are signed, wage
increases retroactive to early this year may be included, possibly lead-
ing to renewed upward pressure on prices.
Following a vote of confidence in October, the Spadolini government
won passage of indirect tax increases designed to reduce the deficit for
this year and next. The enlarged public sector deficit this year is ex-
pected to he about 14 percent of GDP, and the government would like to
reduce this figure to 13 percent next year. Further tax increases and/
or spending cuts will be necessary to achieve this goal,

IV -23
Economic activity in Canada apparently remained very weak in the
third quarter, although there were signs that the rapid economic con-
traction that characterized the first half of the year is over. Manu-
facturers' shipments, partly supplied out of inventories, were up
strongly in August as were new orders. Industrial production rose in
August, but remained below the depressed second quarter rate. Housing
starts, after falling by 21 percent in August, slipped further in Sep-
tember to a 22-year low. The unemployment rate rose to 12.7 percent in
October, up from 12.2 percent in September.
The government has felt constrained in responding to the poor eco-
nomic performance by a much greater-than-expected budget deficit, now
offically forecast to be C$23 billion for 1982 (about 6 percent of
GNP), up from C$19 billion projected in June. On October 27, a job
creation program was announced, to be funded by cutbacks on expenditures
for energy exploration, defense and foreign aid.
Despite the severe economic weakness in Canada, short-term interest
rate declines on balance have lagged somewhat behind those in the United
States. Partly as a result, the exchange value of the Canadian dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar has risen by about 4 percent from June to
October, allowing the Canadian government to bolster its international
reserves even as it paid down borrowings. Even with the slower declines,
however, short-term interest rates in Canada are down almost 500 basis
points from their mid-summer highs, with long-term rates down by about
350 basis points.
Economic weakness in Canada has had only a limited impact thus far
on consumer prices and wage rates. Rates of increase of more sensitive

IV -24
prices have dropped sharply, however. For example, industry selling
prices in the third quarter advanced by 3 percent (a.r.), less than
half of the year-earlier rate. These relative price developments have
put downward pressures on corporate profits, which on a pre-tax basis
in the second quarter were down 9.3 percent from the previous quarter
and 41 percent from a year earlier.
In Sweden the newly elected Social Democratic government of Prime
Minister Palme instituted a 16 percent devaluation of the krona's value
against a basket of currencies in early October. The announced aims of
the measure were to relieve speculative exchange market pressure on the
krona, restore the international competitiveness of Swedish goods, and
provide a stimulus to Swedish industry. The government promised that
fiscal austerity measures would be introduced in the future to accompany
the devaluation. However, the only specific measures implemented or
announced were atemporary wage and price freeze and a two percentage
point increase in VAT. Several of Sweden's major trading partners have
suggested that the size of the devaluation may have been excessive,
constituting a "competitive" devaluation.
