 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity apparently continued to decline in the fourth
quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment fell further in November and indus-
trial production was also lower. Recent data indicate that business
investment is still contracting, and weakness in final demand has hampered
business efforts to reduce inventories. But housing activity has con-
tinued to improve gradually and retail sales posted a sizable gain in
November. The general trend in wage and price inflation remains favor-
able.
Employment and Industrial Production
The demand for labor continued to weaken in November. The overall
unemployment rate rose to 10.8 percent, and the relatively high level of
initial claims during the last two weeks of the month suggests that a
large number of layoffs were still occurring after the November labor
market surveys were taken. The average duration of unemployment also has
lengthened owing to the weak pace of rehiring--up from an average of
16.1 weeks in the third quarter to 17.2 weeks last month.
Nonfarm payroll employment dropped 165,000 last month, about the
same as the average monthly decline so far this year. Much of the job
loss in November occurred in manufacturing, as layoffs continued in the
key durable goods industries--machinery, transportation equipment, and
primary and fabricated metals--which have accounted for nearly half of
the 2.7 million drop in payroll employment during the current recession.
Several nondurable goods industries, including textiles, apparel, and
rubber also reported lower employment last month. The factory workweek
edged up only slightly from the very depressed level of the preceding

two months. Outside of manufacturing, employment increased at finance
and service establishments, while jobs in the trade sector were down for
the fourth month in a row.
The index of industrial production declined 0.4 percent in November,
half as much as in the previous two months. Curtailments in output were
widespread, with continued sharp cutbacks in the durable goods industries.
Assemblies of motor vehicles were further reduced from an already low
level in October, reflecting continued efforts by manufacturers to trim
inventories; but with stocks now reduced substantially, production is
scheduled to move higher in December. Output of raw steel dropped another
7 percent to a level almost 60 percent below its peak in early 1981. Most
components of the business equipment index continued to fall last month,
but the number of oil and gas drilling rigs in operation posted a 3 per-
cent gain after falling sharply over the first ten months of the year.
Reflecting the decline in industrial production, the rate of
capacity utilization in manufacturing fell to 67.8 percent, a new post-
war low. November was the fourth consecutive month in which less than
70 percent of manufacturing capacity was in use.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
The weakness in labor and product markets has cut sharply into
income gains in recent months. Growth of wage and salary disbursements
slowed considerably in the third quarter and remained weak in October.
The reduction in employment in November suggest that private wages and
salaries probably remained sluggish last month as well. Total personal
income in October rose appreciably, however, as a result of a sharp
increase in transfer payments; unemployment insurance benefits were

extended for up to an additional 10 weeks, and cost-of-living adjustments
were made under several other programs.
Total retail sales rose 2.3 percent in November; gains were concen-
trated in sales at automotive outlets. Purchase of domestic autos rose
to a 6-3/4 million unit annual rate in November as buyers responded to
special interest rate concessions and other sales promotions offered
primarily, on 1982 cars. However, sales dropped back to a 5-3/4 million
unit rate in the first ten days of December. Sales of foreign cars--at
a 2.6 million unit annual rate in November--were the strongest since
early 1981.
Excluding autos and nonconsumer items, retail sales rose 0.6 per-
cent in November, following three months of virtually no change. Outlays
at the GAF group of stores increased 0.8 percent last month, after a
protracted period of weakness. Sales at apparel stores were up noticeably,
while spending at general merchandisers and furniture and appliance
dealers posted small gains for the second month in a row. In real terms,
outlays excluding autos in November probably were no higher than the
third-quarter average.
The November increase in retail sales is consistent with the improve-
ment evident recently in consumer surveys. During the past two months,
the Michigan index of sentiment recovered somewhat with reduced prices
and expectations of lower interest rates cited as the main reasons for
the improvement. In addition, the Conference Board index of consumer
confidence rose 10 percent last month.
Residential Construction
Residential construction activity has continued to rise, reflecting
the further easing of financial conditions in recent months. In October
both starts and permits for single-family houses were above their already-

improved third quarter pace. Multifamily starts nearly matched the third-
quarter level, which had been inflated by a push to begin construction
on HUD-subsidized rental units before the end of the fiscal year. More-
over, building permits for multifamily units--a measure that is not dis-
torted by government subsidy programs--continued to advance in October,
to a level almost 20 percent above the third-quarter average. Residential
construction expenditures also improved in October, continuing the up-
ward trend that began in early 1982. In real terms, these outlays were
14 percent above the low reached last February.
In October, new home sales remained at the improved level seen in
September, and were 35 percent above the rate a year earlier. Although
sales of existing homes have not yet recovered significantly, modest
gains were registered in both September and October. Real estate
activity has now strengthened appreciably in all major regions of the
country.
Business Fixed Investment
Business equipment spending has continued on the downtrend that
began in mid-1981. Shipments of nondefense capital goods dropped 4-1/2
percent in October, and were nearly 16 percent below their pre-recession
peak. All of the decline occurred in machinery, with reductions wide-
spread by category. Sales of heavy-weight trucks, already at low levels

tion expenditures on new buildings rose in September and October, after
falling sharply in the two preceding months.
Data on commitments for new capital spending show no signs of a
near-term improvement in activity. Orders for nondefense capital goods

were about unchanged in October, but were still 5 percent below shipments.
Although volatile from one month to the next, these orders have been
declining, on balance, for over a year. Contracts for commercial and
industrial buildings increased a bit in October, but have been on a
substantial downtrend since late 1979. With vacancy rates rising, it
is likely that office construction will fall sharply, once current
projects are completed.
A number of indicators of business spending intentions also suggest
further reductions in coming quarters. The Commerce Department's survey
of plant and equipment spending plans, taken in late October and November,
reported that nonfarm business expenditures for plant and equipment are
expected to be only 2 percent higher (at an annual rate) in the first
half of 1983 than in the second half of this year, suggesting a decline
of more than 2 percent in real terms. Even larger reductions were implied
by the McGraw-Hill and Merrill Lynch surveys taken in October. In
addition, the Conference Board reported that the nation's 1,000 largest
manufacturers reduced capital appropriations 11 percent in the third
quarter to a level 40 percent below a year earlier.
Inventory Investment
Weak shipments and sales continued to frustrate efforts by businesses
to pare unwanted inventories. At the end of October, the inventory-sales
ratio for all manufacturing and trade rose to 1.55 based on book value
data, slightly higher than the previous peak of 1.54 in January.
Manufacturers continued cutting inventories in October. The book
value of manufacturers' stocks fell at an annual rate of $2.2 billion,
the tenth monthly decline since November 1981. This string of cutbacks

has reduced manufacturers' inventories $2.3 billion, or 0.8 percent,
below their prerecession level. However, shipments have fallen more
than 10 percent during the same period, causing the stock-sales positions
of many industries to deteriorate. In particular, metals and machinery
inventories are still very much out of line with sales.
The book value of trade inventories fell slightly in October following
several months of large increases, but the October reduction was entirely
the result of successful efforts to pare auto stocks; automotive inven-
tories fell $11 billion at an annual rate. Dealers continued this liquida-
tion into November, as car production was reduced further and sales were
boosted sharply by low-interest financing programs. By the end of November,
stocks of new domestic autos were down to about 1.2 million units--one
of the lowest levels in the last two years.
In contrast, nonauto retail inventories have been rising since
late summer. Imbalances have reappeared at many types of outlets,
particularly general merchandise, apparel, and furniture stores. In
October, the inventory-sales ratio for these stores reached 2.43, not
far below the January peak of 2.45.
Federal Government
The federal unified budget deficit in October was a record $26.5
billion. However, after adjusting for seasonal factors, the October
deficit was only $1 billion higher than the average monthly deficit of
$13 billion (seasonally adjusted) in the third quarter.
On the receipts side, withheld tax collections slowed markedly in
October, reflecting weak wage and salary performance as well as delayed

II-14
adjustments by taxpayers to last July's cut in withholding rates.
Corporate refunds also continued at a very high level. October outlays
were increased by strong growth in agricultural payments, which
apparently continued into November. Outlays for Social Security were
boosted in October by lump sum retroactive payments based on recomputa-
tions of benefits for many recipients, while federal employee compensa-
tion also rose, reflecting the recent pay increase.
By the end of the current "lame duck" session, Congress is expected
to pass a 5-cent-per-gallon increase in the federal motor fuels excise
tax. The proceeds will be used to finance increases in highway and mass
transit construction. At the same time, action on FY 1983 appropriations
bills continues to lag. With significant work remaining on more than
half of these bills, the focus of Congressional action has shifted toward
the passage of a continuing resolution that will extend funding through
March 15.
The strong growth of real defense purchases continued in the third
quarter. However, in spite of the buildup, the implicit deflator for
defense purchases has started to decelerate in recent quarters, albeit
less than the GNP deflator. This slowing of price increases for defense
has been most pronounced in nondurables (primarily fuel) and services
other than compensation. The compensation deflator also will begin to
slow in the current quarter as both military and civilian defense pay
raises were limited to 4 percent this October (the pay raises in October
1981 were 14.4 percent for military personnel and 4.8 percent for civilian
employees). The rate of increase in the defense durable goods deflator

has remained fairly constant, suggesting the presence of some demand
pressure on prices from defense procurement activities.
State and Local Government
Activity in the state and local sector remains at the plateau that
has prevailed since late last year. Preliminary November data indicate
that state and local government employment has been virtually flat since
September at a level slightly below the average in the first half of the
year. However, the decline in construction has abated in recent months.
Preliminary data showed that real construction outlays rose almost 1
percent in October, bringing the increase since July to about 5 percent.
Even so, these outlays remain almost 20 percent below the recent peak
in the first quarter of 1981.
Labor Costs and Prices
Wage inflation has continued to slow in recent months. Wage rates
for production workers rose at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate over the
first half of 1982, but for the last five months the rate of increase
dropped to a 4-1/2 percent annual rate. The deceleration has been
particularly striking in services and manufacturing, where wages have
risen at about a 3 percent annual rate over the last three months, com-
pared with a 7-1/2 percent rate earlier this year. Concessions negotiated
in the auto industry last spring contributed to the reduced wage increases
in manufacturing--auto workers usually receive annual wage adjustments as
well as COLAs in the fall, but these increases were eliminated this year.
However, the new 13-month Chrysler contract provided its workers with
an initial increase of 6-1/4 percent and restores quarterly COLAs
beginning in December.

While the length and depth of the recession clearly have cut into
wage inflation, the recent rebound in productivity has been an additional
important factor in holding down labor costs. Productivity in the nonfarm
business sector advanced at a 4 percent annual rate in the third quarter,
following small increases in the first half. Moreover, the sharp cutbacks
in hours worked in October and November imply another sizable productivity
gain in the fourth quarter. Higher output per hour, coupled with a moderate
rise in hourly compensation, lowered the advance in unit labor costs to a
2-1/2 percent annual rate in the third quarter and to a 5 percent rate so
far this year.
The reduction in labor cost pressures has been accompanied by a
widespread slowing in inflation. Most measures of consumer prices have
risen at about a 5 percent annual rate since last December, compared with
inflation rates of about 9 percent in 1981. Increases for producer
prices of finished goods have been even lower--less than a 4 percent rate
over the first 11 months of this year. Producer prices did rise somewhat
more rapidly than this average rate in November. But a jump in heating
oil prices contributed importantly to the overall increase, and these
prices have receded in recent weeks.
In October, the CPI rose at a 5-3/4 percent annual rate, a little
faster than in recent months. Small price increases for food and energy
as well as declining homeownership costs helped to hold down the overall
pace of inflation. Prices for consumer commodities other than food, energy,
and homeownership have decelerated sharply this year, although in October
there were some large increases for several commodities, including

cigarettes and magazines. Inflation for services (other than energy and
homeownership) in October remained near this year's average rate of 7-1/2
percent, well below the 10-1/2 percent climb in 1981.
Outside the consumer sector, price increases for capital equipment
have slowed significantly, reflecting the spreading weakness in the
investment sector. Prices of capital equipment were up at an average
annual rate of about 3 percent in October and November, and have risen
at only a 4 percent annual rate since last December. The improvement
this year has been impressive, with small increases or even some declines
in such categories as generators, transformers, many types of machinery
and equipment, and trucks. Perhaps even more notable, prices for inter-
mediate materials (other than food) have been virtually flat in 1982--
for the first time in 15 years--reflecting slack markets as well as a
strong dollar.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Both M1 and M2 grew rapidly in November, as the public continued to
expand its holdings of the most liquid types of assets. Thus far there
has been no indication of an unwinding of the October buildup in demand
deposits, other checkable deposits, and savings accounts that had been
associated with maturing all savers certificates (ASCs). Expansion in
M3 moderated slightly in November, as weak loan demand allowed commercial
banks to reduce their reliance on large CDs.
Interest rates have fallen somewhat further since the November FOMC
meeting in response to two half-point cuts in the discount rate and con-
tinued signs of weakness in the economy. Federal funds are now trading
near 8-1/2 percent, compared with 9-1/2 percent at the time of the last
FOMC meeting; most other short-term rates have fallen between one-half and
one percentage point. In long-term markets yields have shown less tendency
to decline in the face of substantial borrowing activity. Corporate and
Treasury yields are unchanged or down 20 basis points on balance over the
intermeeting period. As of early December, yields in the heavily congested
municipal securities market were up about 20 basis points, but they likely
have moved lower with the latest cut in the discount rate. Most mortgage
commitment rates have continued to edge downward.
The public sectors have tapped financial markets for an extraordi-
narily large volume of funds in recent weeks. The Treasury has raised
close to $50 billion thus far in the fourth quarter to finance a record
quarterly deficit, and the volume of tax-exempt offerings has soared to
record levels as many municipal borrowers have rushed to market bonds be-
fore January 1, the date when new registration requirements for municipal

securities go into effect. In contrast, total borrowing by nonfinancial
businesses appears to have dropped a bit, though firms are continuing to
borrow heavily in long-term markets to pay down short-term liabilities.
In the household sector, consumer installment credit remains depressed,
but there are some signs that residential mortgage borrowing may be reviv-
ing.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 expanded at a 16 percent annual rate in November, down from Octo-
ber's 20 percent clip. Although demand deposit growth moderated, other
checkable deposits continued to rise at an exceptionally rapid rate. The
fast growth in M1 in recent months, despite weakness in economic activity,
in part reflects a lagged response to rate declines that began last sum-
mer.1 Apart from such "normal" interest elasticity of M1 demand, lower
interest rates probably have slowed the readjustment of portfolios occa-
sioned by the maturation of ASCs, especially in view of the new, attrac-
tive deposit instruments which will become available in December and
January.
The slower growth of M1 in November was more than offset by faster
expansion in nontransaction accounts; consequently, M2 accelerated to an
11-1/4 percent annual growth rate for the month. The pickup in the non-
transaction component of M2 was accounted for by a sharp reduction in net
outflows from small time deposits which, in part, may be attributed to
much smaller amounts of maturing ASCs in November.
Total inflows to savings accounts at depository institutions in No-
vember were only slightly below the record October pace. The continued

strength of savings deposits, as well as that of some short-maturity time
deposits, may in part represent a tendency of depositors to use such
accounts as a temporary repository for funds while awaiting the money mar-
ket deposit account (MMDA), scheduled for introduction on December 14.1 A
number of institutions, for example, have actively marketed arrangements
using passbooks, 7- to 31-day accounts, and especially retail RPs as vehi-
cles for attracting and holding funds in anticipation of the new account.2
Among other nontransaction components of M2, overnight RPs at com-
mercial banks continued to grow at a robust pace in November, accompanying
a substantial buildup in holdings of Treasury securities and a runoff in
Treasury deposits. Although the increase in assets of general purpose and
broker/dealer money market mutual funds was somewhat higher on a monthly
average basis in November than in October, inflows remained well below the
pace of the first three quarters. Moreover, fund assets actually declined
in late November and early December, as the returns on money funds moved
into closer alignment with rates of interest on other short-term instru-
ments and possibly as funds were moved to MMDA bridge accounts.
Despite the acceleration in M2, M3 growth was a bit less rapid in
November than in October, because of a substantial decline in large time
deposits at commercial banks and, to a lesser extent, a deceleration in
1. On December 6 the DIDC also authorized a "Super NOW" account that has
many of the features of an MMDA, including payment of an unregulated rate
of interest whenever the balance exceeds $2,500. This account becomes
available to individuals, governmental units and certain non-profit orga-
nizations on January 5, 1983, and could prolong the period during which
depositors are choosing where to place their funds.
2. Information available from the Reserve Bank Contact Group indicates
that such "bridge" accounts were common in about half of the Federal
Reserve districts. Most institutions offering bridge accounts were pay-
ing rates in the 10 to 12 percent range, with reported rates varying from
9 to as much as 25 percent.

institution-only money market funds. Issuance of domestic CDs fell
sharply as banks evidently were able to satisfy weak loan demand through
core deposit growth. In contrast, thrift institutions, particularly S&Ls,
stepped up their reliance on large CDs and other managed liabilities, us-
ing some of these funds to repay more costly Federal Home Loan Bank ad-
vances.
Growth in overall bank credit in November registered its slowest
rate in 2-1/2 years, reflecting primarily a sharp contraction in business
loans. The weakness in business loans, which was most pronounced at large
banks, was indicative of both a general decline in overall external financ-
ing by firms and efforts by businesses to fund short-term debt. Security
loans also contracted in November, following rapid expansion beginning in
the summer, while real estate and consumer loan expansion remained slug-
gish. Both large and small banks continued to acquire Treasury securities
at a rapid pace; judging from data from the large banks, most of these
acquisitions continued to be in the one- to five-year maturity range.
Business Finance
Total external financing by nonfinancial businesses appears to have
moderated further in November from the reduced pace of October; the smaller
volume of borrowing likely reflects continued declines in capital spending,
a resumption of inventory liquidation in the fourth quarter, and perhaps
some increase in firms' cash flow. As in recent months, businesses con-
tinued to pay off short-term debt with money raised in the capital markets.
In both October and November, the sum of business loans and commercial
paper of nonfinancial corporations contracted for the first time since
the 1975-76 period, when corporations last undertook a major restructuring

of their balance sheets. Gross public offerings of corporate bonds and
notes, meanwhile, have run at a seasonally adjusted monthly pace near
$6.5 billion since September, and more recently the volume of new equity
offerings also has accelerated.
Despite these shifts away from short-term debt in favor of longer-
term securities, corporate balance sheet measures still remain weak by
historical standards. The ratio of short-term to total debt for non-
financial corporations has moved down only slightly from its recent peak,
and the ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities is quite low
(see chart on page 111-8). Data from other sources also indicate that
corporations remain under considerable stress in the current environment:
businesses continue to petition for bankruptcy in record numbers; and
rating agencies have been downgrading long-term debt obligations this
year at double the then-record pace of 1981. Nonetheless, spreads between
yields on short-term private paper and U.S. Treasury bills, and between
market yields on lower- and higher-grade commercial paper, have narrowed
appreciably from late-summer levels, suggesting that market concerns about
financial distress have been abating. Declining interest rates and actions
to deal with international loan problems have helped to allay such fears.
Over the past two months bond markets have been marked by the absence
of the innovative financing techniques that were so widely used earlier in
the year. Rather, most new bond issues have borne market coupons, and
slightly more than half of November's domestic issues--measured both in
numbers and dollars--had maturities of 20 years or more. For weaker firms,
convertible bond issues have continued to offer an attractive vehicle for

obtaining financing; nearly all of the recent convertible issues have had
less than A ratings.
One noteworthy change in domestic bond issuance in November was a
slackening in the volume of higher-rated offerings. This dropoff may
reflect the belief among some issuers that long-term interest rates will
resume their descent in the not-too-distant future. The overall volume
of longer-term straight-debt issues, however, suggests that this view is
not held universally, or perhaps that lesser-rated firms have a more
immediate need for long-term financing.
Stock prices have exhibited fairly volatile movements since mid-
November, and currently are only a little higher than at the time of the
last meeting of the FOMC. The rise in stock prices since the summer has
induced some increase in the pace of new equity offerings, especially by
industrial firms, and in early December AT&T sold a record $1.1 billion
issue of new common stock.
Government Finance
Federal sector. The Treasury borrowed heavily in November and early
December to help finance a record combined deficit of $72 billion in the
fourth quarter. Of this amount, the Treasury is expected to raise $53
billion in the market,1 and to obtain most of the rest by reducing its
cash balance. As of mid-December, the Treasury had raised $48 billion
of its fourth-quarter needs, with the rest to be borrowed in regular bill
auctions. The Treasury also announced a number of coupon auctions to be
held in December for settlement early next year; borrowing in the first
quarter of 1983 is expected to be even greater than in the current quarter.
1. This borrowing projection is well above the Treasury's estimate of
$46.5 billion announced at the time of the mid-quarter financing.

III-12
Federally sponsored credit agencies repaid an estimated $1.1 bil-
lion in debt during November, following a paydown of about $350 million
the previous month. Federal Home Loan Banks reduced their debt by about
$300 million in November, as thrifts repaid FHLB advances for the fifth
straight month. Although gross mortgage purchases by FNMA were quite
large, FNMA cut its debt by about $200 million in November. Mortgage
purchases apparently were financed by a reduction in the agency's liquid
assets and by mortgage sales through the issuance of pass-through securi-
ties. The Federal Farm Credit Banks pared their outstanding liabilities
by an estimated $660 million in November, reflecting generally depressed
loan demand by farmers and perhaps some shift in agricultural credit
demands to other sources. For example, loans by the Commodity Credit Cor-
poration are estimated to have increased sharply in the past two months.
State and local sector. Municipal securities markets continued to
experience a deluge of new long-term bond issues in November and early
December. Gross offerings of tax-exempt bonds were a record $8.0 billion
(seasonally adjusted) in November, exceeding by a slight margin the heavy
October volume. Even more borrowing is expected for December. Some of
the stepped-up issuance may well reflect the decline in rates over the
past few months, but in addition there has been a rush to sell bonds
before January 1, the effective date of a new federal law requiring all
municipal securities maturing in one year or more to be sold in regis-
tered form, with the owner's name on record.1
1. In mid-December an amendment was passed in the House of Representatives
that would postpone for a year the effective date of the registration re-
quirement for municipal bonds. This proposal has yet to be taken up by
the Senate, however.

III-13
Municipal dealers report that the heavy bond volume has been absorb-
ed largely by individuals, either directly or through purchases of shares
in open-end bond funds and unit investment trusts. Available data suggest
that commercial banks have remained on the sidelines. However, acquisi-
tions of tax-exempts by property and casualty insurance companies report-
edly have picked up somewhat in the last few weeks, even though continued
record underwriting losses discourage their participation on a large scale.
Reflecting the heavy volume of new issues and still weak demand by
major institutional investors, yields on long-term municipal bonds rose
about 20 basis points between the last FOMC meeting and early December.
As of December 9 (latest available), the Bond Buyer indexes were 10.13
percent for general obligations and 10.79 percent for revenue bonds. The
ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields rose in November to near its high
levels of earlier in the year (see chart on page III-14).
Mortgage Markets
In the primary mortgage market, interest rates on conventional home
loans have edged down a bit further since the November FOMC meeting; the
average rate on new commitments at S&Ls for fixed-rate, level-payment home
mortgages was 13.66 percent in early December, about 18 basis points lower
than at the time of the last meeting. In the more sensitive secondary
markets, rates as of early December had backed up about 10 to 50 basis
points but have retraced most of this rise since then. In mid-November,
when yields on GNMA-guaranteed securities were falling, the administration
reduced ceiling rates on standard FHA and VA home mortgages one-half per-
centage point to 12 percent; since then, however, average effective rates
on commitments for FHA-insured level-payment mortgages have remained near

Although various indicators suggest that mortgage lending activity
may be picking up, hard evidence confirming this remains scanty. For
example, balance sheet data for S&Ls indicate that overall mortgage lend-
ing by these institutions was very weak in October as $931 million in net
acquisitions of mortgage-backed securities offset only a small portion of
a $3.8 billion decline in outright mortgage holdings.1 Nevertheless, new
mortgage commitments at S&Ls were $5.8 billion in October, the same as in
September, but above the $4-1/2 to $5 billion range that prevailed during
the first seven months of the year. Other evidence suggesting a revival
of mortgage activity has been more indirect. For example, respondents to
the mid-November Survey of Senior Loan Officer Opinion reported that demand
for mortgage credit at commercial banks had risen, on balance, over the
previous three months.2 Moreover, the flow of applications for FHA insur-
ance and VA guarantees continued to increase through November; for the
month as a whole, the number of applications for FHA home mortgages rose
to a record 1.2 million seasonally adjusted annual rate. Some of the
apparent increase in mortgage activity reportedly has been for the purpose
of refinancing, but the aggregate volume of this activity is unknown. In
1. There is some doubt about the quality of the October figures. The bal-
ance sheet data include the effects of a regulatory accounting change that
permitted associations, beginning in September, to reclassify as "contra-
assets" (that is, deductions from asset accounts) certain items formerly
reported as liabilities. This change will reduce the reported level of
mortgage loans on an institution's balance sheet, impairing the compara-
bility of recent mortgage data with those for earlier periods. In addi-
tion, the change may have caused confusion among S&Ls and, as a result,
may have led to reporting errors on the preliminary October balance sheet.

addition, home buyers likely are relying less on creative financing ar-
rangements and channeling a greater portion of their mortgage borrowing
through institutional lenders.
In the secondary market, total agency issuance of mortgage pass-
through securities reached a new high of $5.9 billion in October, boost-
ed by a surge in new issues of mortgage pass-through securities by FNMA.
Although swap transactions by FNMA and FHLMC continued to account for the
bulk of pass-through volume, an increased share consisted of nonswap is-
sues designed to channel funds to the primary mortgage market. In Novem-
ber, issuance of pass-through securities guaranteed by GNMA and by FHLMC
picked up a bit.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit contracted slightly in October, the
first decline since December 1981. All major categories of such credit
weakened appreciably, with particularly large declines registered in both
the automobile and the large "other" categories. Some strengthening in
auto credit is anticipated for November, however, in light of the rebound
in new car sales.
Interest rates on new car and personal loans at commercial banks
have come down about one percentage point since early August. Although
these rates remain high, responses to the Senior Loan Officer Survey indi-
cated a greater willingness by banks to make such loans. Indeed, bank
data show a moderate increase in consumer loans at these institutions in

an average close to 18 percent prior to the reductions.
Delinquency rates on consumer installment loans remained very low
during the third quarter. At the same time, however, mortgage delinquen-
cies continued to worsen, according to survey data from commercial banks
and FHLBB reports of mortgage delinquency rates at S&Ls. The FHLBB series
reached a new high in October of 2.21 percent, seasonally adjusted; two
years ago it was around 1 percent.

Appendix A*
MONETARY AGGREGATES AND BANK CREDIT IN 1982
Ml is expected to increase 8-1/2 percent in 1982 (see Table 1),
the most rapid fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter rate of expansion
since 1977, and well above the 2-1/4 percent rate of increase posted
in 1981 (after adjusting for shifts to NOW accounts). This surge in
narrow money has occurred despite the sharp reduction in income growth.
M1 growth this year has been approximately 2-1/2 percentage points
greater than that implied by the Board's quarterly money demand equa-
tion--given the actual course over the year of income and interest
rates--and has been associated with roughly a 4-1/2 percent drop in
M1 velocity, the largest drop in any four-quarter span since World
War II.
As shown in Table 1, the bulk of the growth in narrow money in
1982 was accounted for by OCDs, which increased more than 34 percent.
The sizable inflows to OCDs coincided with a broad buildup in liquid
assets by the public, including savings deposits, which may have been
attributable to declining open market interest rates and mounting
concerns about future employment and income prospects. Although the
sharp interest rate declines after mid-year boosted demand deposits in
the second half of 1982, it appears that such accounts will increase
by less than $2 billion on net over the year as a whole.
M2 growth in 1982, at a 9-3/4 percent rate, was a bit faster
than the 9-1/2 percent rate in 1981. However, the 5-1/2 percent
drop in M2 velocity over the year was the biggest four-quarter drop
on record. Much of the expansion in nontransactions-M2 comprised
inflows to its most liquid components: savings deposits, overnight
RPs and Eurodollars, general purpose and broker/dealer money market
mutual fund shares, and retail RPs jointly grew at a 14 percent
rate.
Overall expansion in nontransactions-M2, however, increased
only slightly in 1982. Growth in small time deposits moderated as
considerably weaker inflows to less liquid deposit accounts-partic-
ularly 6-month money market certificates and all savers certificates
(which began maturing in October)-more than offset rapid accumulation
of balances in newly authorized 91-day and 7-to 31-day small-denomina-
tion time accounts. Over the year, inflows to both small time deposits
and money market funds were damped by an appreciable narrowing of
interest rate differentials between these assets and fixed-ceiling
instruments. Inflows to general purpose and broker/dealer money
market funds dropped to less than half of their 1981 pace-probably
reflecting as well some flattening of the publics' learning curve
about this instrument-while inflows to small time deposits were off

more than 40 percent. Small time deposits were especially weak in
the fourth quarter, declining on net for the first time since 1960, as
sharply lower open market rates after mid-year evidently encouraged
many investors to place substantial amounts of maturing ASC funds in
OCDs and savings deposits.
Despite significantly smaller spreads between interest rates on
open market instruments and yields on fixed-ceiling deposit accounts,
the fraction of M2 assets bearing indexed-ceiling or ceiling-free
rates of return increased further in 1982. At the end of October 1982
the proportion of M2 bearing market-related yields was about 52 per-
cent, up five percentage points from a year earlier.
M3 growth ebbed to a 10-1/2 percent rate in 1982--from 11-1/2
percent in 1981--as the pickup in M2 growth and a turnaround in term
RPs failed to offset markedly slower growth of both institution-only
money fund assets and large-denomination time deposits. Reflecting
strength in core deposits at commercial banks and somewhat slower
growth in bank credit, gross issuance of large time deposits by
commercial banks in 1982 has declined sharply (see Table 2). Expan-
sion of large time deposits net of amounts held by non-money stock
holders, however, is expected to contract by less than the cutback
in gross issuance owing to appreciable runoffs of bank CDs held by
money market mutual funds. Over the year, commercial banks advanced
a substantial volume of funds raised in domestic markets to their
foreign offices as lower interest costs on domestic liabilities
relative to Eurodollar rates favored domestic funding of bank assets.
Growth of commercial bank credit in 1982 was distorted by an
estimated $33 billion of loans and investments shifted from domestic
offices to IBFs, mostly in December of last year and January of this
year. Allowing for these shifts by using a December 1981/January
1982 base, bank credit expanded at a 6-3/4 percent annual rate through
November 1982, 1-1/4 percentage points below that of a year ago
(measured on a fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter basis). Much of the
deceleration from 1981 occurred in business loans, reflecting weak
economic activity and, in the second half of the year, sharply
falling interest rates that encouraged many firms to refinance short-
term indebtedness. Real estate lending also slowed noticeably in the
second half of 1982. Banks responded to falling loan demand in the
face of continued strong core deposit inflows partly by restricting
managed liabilities and partly by adding to investments--mainly
Treasury securities.

Appendix B*
SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES
Against the backdrop of a weak economy and continued funding
by firms of short-term indebtedness, business loans at large commer-
cial banks contracted in November. Moreover, nearly nine tenths of
the 60 large commercial banks participating in the November 15, 1982,
Survey of Senior Loan Officer Opinion on Bank Lending Practices
expected business loan demand not to strengthen through mid-February.
Indeed, almost one third of the sampled banks anticipated loan demand
to weaken further in the coming months, the same fraction as in the
previous (mid-August) survey.
As loan demand on balance has fallen off in recent months,
banks have continued to cut their prime rate, bringing it into
closer alignment with short-term open market rates. At the time
of the November survey, the spread between the prime and one-month
commercial paper rates was about 315 basis points, down from 460
basis points in mid-August. Other aspects of lending terms, however,
appear largely unaltered. Eighty percent of the respondents reported
no change in compensating balance or fee requirements for business
loans compared with three months earlier, and almost as many banks
indicated no change in standards to qualify for the prime.1 About
70 percent of the sample reported essentially unchanged standards
to qualify for given spreads above prime.
Continuing the trend that became evident in the February 1982
survey, respondents reporting a more restrictive stance on lending
to new and nonlocal business customers greatly outnumbered those
indicating an easier stance. By contrast, almost half of the sample
expressed greater willingness to make consumer installment loans to
individuals, three times the fraction so reporting in August, while
no respondents indicated reduced willingness. Factors cited by banks
for this change in willingness included wider spreads between interest
rates on consumer loans and banks' cost of funds and, for Michigan
banks, the removal of usury ceilings in that state.
Responses to the first supplemental question dealing with
changes in credit quality revealed continued deterioration in the
financial condition of existing business loan customers at surveyed
banks. For the third consecutive survey, more than 85 percent of the

panel perceived an erosion during the past three months in the
average financial condition of customers to whom they had business
loans outstanding (see table below). In addition, about 40 percent

of the respondents indicated a deterioration in the average financial
condition of new loan applicants. More than 40 percent of the sample
reported increases in delinquency rates on home mortgages--double the
fraction so reporting in August--while 25 percent of the banks noted
deteriorations in delinquency rates on consumer installment loans,
about the same fraction as reported improvements.1
The housing, real estate, and construction industries continued
to be the most frequently cited business sector where financial dete-
rioration has occurred, both for existing borrowers and for new loan
applicants. Also cited heavily were the agricultural machinery,
energy, manufacturing, capital equipment, and automotive-related
industries. About one third of the respondents reported financial
deterioration across the board.
As in previous surveys, the majority of affected banks reacted
to deterioration in the credit quality of new applicants for business
loans by increasing rejection rates, while banks noting deterioration
in the financial condition of existing borrowers responded by requiring
additional collateral or restructuring payments, often in combination
with other measures.2 Banks responded to delinquencies on home mort-
gages and consumer installment loans primarily by repossessing colla-
teral, restructuring payments, or some of each.
1. Since delinquency rates on home mortgage loans typically rise
near year-end, part of the deterioration in delinquency rates on
these loans from August to November may reflect seasonal influences.
However, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board series on mortgage delin-
quency rates at S&Ls (available through October), which is seasonally-
adjusted, also has shown a rise since August.
2. Other measures cited by banks include the waiving or removal of
covenants, and closer monitoring of existing credits.

III-B-3
Reflecting the substantial drop in mortgage rates in recent
months, there are signs of a pickup in home mortgage activity at
surveyed banks. In response to a second set of supplemental ques-
tions dealing with home mortgage activity, more than 40 percent of
the respondents offering home mortgages reported stronger demand for
commitments to make first mortgage loans compared with three months
earlier, roughly three times the fraction noting weaker demand for
commitments. Forty percent of the panel noted a shift in the compo-
sition of demand for home mortgage credit toward fixed-rate loans,
perhaps reflecting borrowers' concerns about a future backup in
interest rates. In contrast, less than 20 percent of the sample--
mainly banks with under $5 billion in assets--expressed a greater
willingness to make such loans, while the great majority of banks
indicated no change in policy.
In making new home mortgage commitments, sampled banks appeared
to some extent to specialize in either fixed- or adjustable-rate
loans; about one third of the panel reported that the share of new
commitments made in October comprising fixed-rate loans was between
0 and 25 percent, and around half reported that the share was between
76 and 100 percent.1 Even though most respondents reported that the
bulk of their new home mortgage commitments were for fixed-rate loans,
however, only one fourth of the panel reported that the fraction of
commitments accounted for by fixed-rate loans in October was higher
than in August. Nearly 85 percent of those banks offering fixed-rate
home mortgages, but less than 40 percent of those offering adjust-
able-rate mortgages, indicated they did so with the intent to sell
the loans in the secondary market.
Respondents indicated on average that about 90 percent of their
current home mortgage lending was for the purchase of a home, with the
remainder used chiefly to refinance existing mortgages.2 At certain
institutions, however, the share attributable to refinancings deviated
markedly from the average, ranging from near zero to as much as 60
percent of total mortgage lending. About one fourth of the panel
reported that refinancings accounted for a larger proportion of new
home mortgage loans than three months ago.
1. Several banks that cited proportions in the lower range noted that
most of their fixed-rate commitments were to finance sales of fore-
closed properties, to help beleaguered home builders, or to assist
corporate clients that relocate personnel.
2. On average, respondents reported that mortgage loans for other
purposes--such as for home improvements, or other expenditures--made
up less than two percent of their total mortgage lending. At some
banks, however, this share was as large as 20 percent.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the November FOMC meeting, the dollar has depreciated by 4
percent on a weighted average basis. Most of the dollar's decline has
been against the yen and Continental European currencies. The chart in
the lower panel on the next page shows the substantial bilateral rate
changes among the major currencies. Since the beginning of November, the
dollar has depreciated by 12 percent against the yen, 6 percent versus
the mark, and has appreciated by 4 percent against the pound.
The overall depreciation of the dollar seems largely attrib-
utable to market reassessment of the trade and current account prospects
for the United States. Statements by several U.S. government officials
and private forecasters suggesting a substantial widening of the trade
deficit next year, in addition to a large monthly deficit reported in
October, helped to heighten market awareness of the long run effects on
trade of the dollar's appreciation over the last two years.
The dollar recent depreciation against Continental European
currencies has not been associated with a relative decline in dollar
interest rates. Although short term dollar interest rates have fallen
slightly over the last month, rate declines have been larger in several
European countries. The Bundesbank reduced its Lombard and discount
rates by one percentage point, and official lending rates were also
lowered 1 percentage point in Denmark and Austria. Official rates were
lowered by 1/2 percent in Switzerland and the Netherlands, while the Bank
of France lowered its money market intervention rate by 1/4 percent.
Market rates in Japan have not changed, and this has been a factor

contributing to the yen's strength against European currencies as well as
against the dollar.
The decline of the pound has been largely attributed to the
current weakness in world oil markets. Sterling interest rates increased
by one and a half percentage points following actions by the Bank of
England to tighten liquidity,
French officials announced that they have decided to
draw down the entire $4 billion credit arranged in October to help defend
the franc.
The new President of Mexico was inaugurated two weeks ago, and
has announced some of the details of an economic reorganization program.
Some controls on foreign exchange trading in Mexico will be lifted as of
next Monday, which will effectively reinstate a freely floating foreign
exchange market. In addition, a controlled foreign exchange market will
be maintained, at rates fixed daily by the Bank of Mexico, for the purpose
of subsidizing certain imports and debt payments. At the same time,
Mexico has requested a rescheduling of $20 billion of principal payments
on public sector loans maturing before the end of 1984, and has also asked
to borrow an additional $5 billion from private foreign banks during
1983.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
U.S. banking offices (including IBFs) brought in $5 billion from
their own foreign offices between September and November, as shown in
line 1 (a) below. The inflow of funds to the domestic offices of U.S.
banks appears, in part, to reflect the easing of the financing problems
faced by a number of major banks during the summer, when their non-U.S.
offices were having difficulties raising funds. One manifestation of
these problems was the $4.5 billion third-quarter fall in the Eurodollar
holdings of U.S. nonbanks -- see line 3. However, it appears likely
that growth in such holdings has resumed in the fourth quarter and this

resurgence is refected in the strong $3 billion addition to the Euro-
dollar holdings of money market mutual funds during the October-November
period.
The recent pace of Eurobond issuance of U.S. corporate borrowers
has weakened considerably from the $1 billion average monthly rate for
the August-November period. There has not been a single Eurobond issue
since late November. Moreover, payments for Eurobonds placed by U.S.
corporate borrowers in November were only a fraction of the $1 billion
volume issued, because much of the activity was in so-called delayed-
payment offerings. Under such arrangements, Eurobond investors only
have to pay for part of their purchases initially (typically 25 per
cent) and have several months to pay the balance.
U.S. official reserve assets rose by over $3 billion in October
and November as the Treasury and Federal Reserve made short-term
advances to Brazil and Mexico, and the U.S. reserve position with the
IMF also increased as the Fund advanced dollars to member countries.
This jump in U.S. official reserve assets added to the Treasury's
borrowing requirement from the public in those months.
U.S. Merchandise Trade
In October, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was $65 billion
at an annual rate. Thus far in the second half of the year the deficit
has increased substantially from first-half average rates. For the
July-October period the deficit was $30 billion annual rate larger than
in the first half of the year; the decline in exports was about equal
to the rise in imports.

IV -7
Both agricultural and nonagricultural shipments contributed to
the drop in total exports. About 60 percent of the drop since mid-year
was in the value of agricultural exports. Sharp declines in the volume
shipped (particularly wheat and corn) accounted for two-thirds of the
value decrease. The decrease was in response to good crops world-wide
and sluggish demand from the developing countries, Western Europe, and
Eastern Europe. Grain exports to the U.S.S.R. dropped from 3.4 million
metric tons in the first half to close to zero in July-October.
The decline in nonagricultural exports since mid-year was largely
in industrial supplies (especially coal and fertilizer), civilian air-
craft, and automotive exports to Canada. The value of machinery
exports (one-third of nonagricultural exports) was about the same in
July-October as in the first half of the year. Nonagricultural exports

continued to be adversely affected by weak economic conditions in major
trading partners and decreasing price competitiveness caused by the
appreciation of the dollar. By area, most of the decline in non-
agricultural exports was in shipments to the developing countries (with
about one-third of that decline to Mexico alone).
The increase in imports since mid-year was evenly split between
the value of oil and nonoil imports. Oil imports in July-October were
nearly 1 million barrels per day greater than the first-half average
(partly a result of a large inventory draw-down in the first-half and
some inventory buildup in July and August). On average, oil import
prices were slightly higher in July-October, reflecting the delayed
impact of a temporary increase in spot market prices during late spring.
In September and October oil import prices moved slightly under $31 per
barrel.
The increase in nonoil imports since mid-year was in foods
(particularly coffee), industrial supplies (other than steel), consumer
goods, and automotive products from Japan and Europe. Steel imports
fell sharply since mid-year with both price and volume declining
primarily in response to weak U.S. demand. In the case of steel imports
from the European Community (the source of one-third of steel imports)
the decline can also be partly attributed to the threat of counter-
vailing duties becoming effective October 21 unless agreement was
reached the same day, October 21.) By area, much of the import in-
crease was from the developing countries. The volume of nonoil imports
increased, despite sluggish U.S. economic activity, at least partly in

Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity in the major in-
dustrial countries continued to contract on balance during the third
quarter. Real output declined in Italy, Canada and France while it rose
weakly in the United Kingdom and Japan. In Canada, real output last quarter
had fallen to a level almost 6 percent below that of a year earlier and only
in Japan was there a significant year-over-year increase in the third
quarter. As shown in the chart, industrial production in the six major
foreign industrial countries has fallen to early 1979 levels. The unemploy-
ment rate in October was unchanged at post-war highs in France and Canada
and continued to rise in Germany.
The deceleration of consumer prices that began in the major industrial
countries late last year continued into October, when the year-over-year
increase in this measure of inflation fell below 8 percent for the first
time in over three years (see chart). The abatement of wholesale price
increases in these countries generally has been even more pronounced.
Double digit inflation, which a year ago characterized both wholesale and
retail price indexes in several countries, by October persisted only in
Italy.
Monetary conditions abroad have continued to ease, as the German
Bundesbank lowered its official rates by a full percentage point and the
Swiss National Bank reduced its lending rate by 1/2 percentage point on
December 2. In response, lending rates were also reduced by the central
banks of the Netherlands and Austria. In the United Kingdom and Canada,
however, the authorities have acted to resist recent declines in market rates
in light of downward pressures on their currencies. Money growth continues
to be near or above the upper end of target ranges in Germany, France, and,

financial innovation have helped to keep M1 persistently below its target

Individual Country Notes. Following an especially steep decline in
the third quarter, industrial production in Germany fell again in October
to a level no higher than that of end-1976. German steel production in
October was reported to be almost 30 percent below its year-ago level, and
more than one-half of the industry's workers are employed on a part time basis.
The rate of unemployment has continued to rise, reaching 8.4 percent
in October and probably climbing higher in November. Survey information
gathered in September indicated a further worsening of the business climate
generally. The volume of orders in that month was about 13 percent below
September 1981, with weakness about evenly distributed between domestic
and foreign demands.
The rate of consumer price inflation has continued to slow, with
the index for November rising 0.2 percent from the previous month and 4.7
percent from November 1981. The performances of the producers' price and
wholesale price indexes over the last year have been even better.
The current account (n.s.a.) through October showed a deficit of only
$2.1 billion, compared with a deficit of $10.3 billion for the same period
last year.
German monetary policy has continued to ease. On December 2 the
Lombard and discount rates were lowered by one percentage point each to
6 and 5 percent, respectively. This was the sixth reduction of the Lombard
rate since the beginning of this year, when it stood at 10.5 percent,
Short-term money market rates have followed the Lombard rate down.

IV -13
In Japan, real GNP rose by .6 percent in the third quarter, somewhat
less than expected. In October, industrial production declined sharply
to more than three percent below the year-earlier level. The unemployment
rate rose slightly in October to 2.5 percent of the workforce, the highest
level since 1980. Both wholesale and consumer price indexes declined in
November following very moderate increases in October.
The decline in Japan's trade with the rest of the world that began
in January of this year continued into October. October's exports fell
more than $400 million, the largest monthly decline in over two
years, while imports fell $200 million. Japan's trade surplus through
October averaged $1.6 billion per month, very close to the 1981 performance
recorded on a larger trade volume.
Ending more than a month of political uncertainty, the Liberal
Democratic Party chose Nakasone Yasuhiro as the new prime minister of Japan.
Although the outgoing Suzuki Cabinet had completed a preliminary budget for
fiscal year 1983 with nominal expenditures approximately six percent greater
than in 1982, Nakasone stated that there was little likelihood of an enlarged
budget in 1983 or for the increased defense spending that the United States
has requested.
Preliminary data for the third quarter indicate continued but very slow
growth in real GDP in the United Kingdom. Industrial production in September
was unchanged and, on a provisional basis, declined slightly in October. The
September index matched its level six months earlier and was slightly below
that of September 1981. The number of unemployed rose further in November.
However, a change in the procedure by which the United Kingdom unemployment rate
is calculated makes a comparison of November's figure (12.5 percent) with

IV -14
those for earlier periods difficult.
After a small decline in September, the retail price index rose in
October to about 7 percent above its year-earlier level, but has risen at
only a 3 percent rate since April, Wholesale prices in October were 7.4
percent above year-earlier levels,
The cumulative United Kingdom trade surplus for the year to October was
$1,8 billion and the current account was $5-1/4 billion for the same
period, In each case, however, the surplus is running well below that registered
in 1981. Severe pressures on the pound in foreign exchange markets emerged at
the end of November, The Bank of England increased its short-term intervention
rate to 10 percent and London clearing banks raised their base rates from 9 per-
cent to between 10 and 10-1/4 percent. Reported growth of the monetary aggre-
gates was substantial in October, but was distorted by technical factors.
French GDP decreased by nearly one percent in the third quarter, about
reversing the second quarter's gain and bringing growth over the last four
quarters to one percent. After a three percent fall in the summer months,
industrial production rose by almost one percent in September. However, recent
surveys by the Bank of France and the Statistics Institute indicate continuing
and prospective weakness in economic activity.
Price controls, which were put in place in June, contributed significantly
to the measured reduction in the rate of inflation between June and October to
about 4.5 percent (a,r,) for both consumer and wholesale prices. Following
some easing of controls on November 1 consumer prices jumped by one percent in
that month.
Large trade deficits of over $4 billion were recorded for both
the second and third quarters. However, the October trade deficit, which
was only about one-half that in the previous month, may mark the first

IV -15
sign that the French current account will improve following the June
devaluation. The French have recently tightened language and labeling
requirements for imports and added export inducements in an attempt to
improve their foreign balances. Their European trade partners and Japan
have unsuccessfully protested the new French protectionism.
M2 growth in France has slowed recently but is still above the 12-1/2
to 13-1/2 percent target range by about one percentage point. An official
target range for 1983 is expected to be announced by year-end.
In Italy, real GDP declined by three percent from the second quarter
rate and was one percent below the same quarter of last year. A major
contributing factor to the poor performance was a seven percent drop
in exports from the second quarter level. Industrial production was also
weak: its level during the first 10 months of the year was almost two
percent below the corresponding period last year. Despite the depressed
economic activity, consumer price inflation picked up in the July-October
period, in part because of increases in indirect taxes. With the impact
of this effect declining in November, prices rose by 1.3 percent to about
17 percent above their year-earlier level. The acceleration of consumer
prices has stiffened labor's resistance to a cap on cost of living increases
and negotiations over the scala mobile have stalled.
Measured in dollars, the cumulative trade deficit through October of
this year was about $11 billion, or about $4 billion below last year's deficit.
On December 1, Amintore Fanfani's cabinet, representing a coalition
of four parties, was sworn into power. Fanfani's economic program calls
for cuts of 15 billion lire ($10 billion) in the public sector deficit and

IV -16
a strict ceiling of zero on real wage increases for the next two years.
It is unclear whether these measures will be passed by Parliament. In
order to gain the approval of left-wing parties, Fanfani had to abandon
proposals to put a ceiling on pension increases and to reduce public
health spending.
Real economic activity in Canada declined in the third quarter by
one percent, the fifth consecutive quarterly contraction. Although weak-
ness in consumption and business investment intensified somewhat in the
third quarter, the effect on real GNP was cushioned by a slowing in the
rate of business inventory runoffs and a $1 billion improvement in the
current account.
While remaining at high levels, most measures of inflation continue
to show some improvement. For example, third quarter wage settlements,
exclusive of those with cost-of-living provisions, called for average
annual increases over the term of the agreement of 10.9 percent, down from
14,3 percent a year earlier.
Canada's balance of payments position strengthened considerably in
the third quarter as lower interest rates led to a reduced deficit on
service transactions, moving the current account further into surplus,
while the capital account (n.s.a.) swung from an outflow of $3.2 billion
in the second quarter to an inflow of $2,4 billion. This sharp change
in the capital account was mainly the result of increased sales of
bonds abroad to take advantage of a more rapid decline in U.S. interest
rates. In addition, there was positive net direct investment in Canada in
the third quarter, following five consecutive quarters of outflows.

IV -17
As a result of these developments, the Canadian dollar came under strong
upward pressure in the third quarter, allowing authorities to bolster
Canada's international reverves even as they reduced the government's
borrowings under a revolving credit agreement with international banks.
On November 29 the Governor of the Bank of Canada announced that the
Bank had ceased using M1 as a monetary target. The Bank's action recognized
that downward shifts in money demand, stemming from the growing use of
cash management techniques that were difficult to quantify, had reduced
the usefulness of M1 as a monetary target. The Governor indicated that
the Bank of Canada continued to search for a monetary measure that was
reliably related to interest rates and levels of spending.

Economic Activity in Developing Countries. The debt problems of
several developing countries--most notably Argentina, Mexico, and
Brazil--have become acute. LDC imports and economic growth have declined
sharply as a result of the combined effects of reduced demand for LDC
exports and the cutback in new bank lending to major developing coun-
tries.
GNP-weighted average growth in all non-OPEC developing countries
was probably less than 1-1/2 percent in 1982, following 2-1/2 percent
growth in 1981--both record lows for this series which goes back to 1965.
From 1974 to 1980 annual growth in these developing countries averaged
5-1/4 percent, only slightly below the 1965-73 average rate of 5-3/4
percent. Throughout the 1965-1980 period, developing countries in Asia
and Latin America grew faster than those in other regions.

Growth in Latin America was negative in 1982. Of the nine leading
non-OPEC developing country borrowers from BIS-reporting banks, six are
in Latin America: Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Peru.
These six countries account for 65 percent of total non-OPEC LDC bor-
rowing from BIS-reporting banks and 80 percent of Latin American GNP.
All but Colombia have faced debt problems of varying severity this year.
Of the remaining five, only Peru is estimated to have had a positive rate
of economic growth in 1982. The sharpest drop is likely to be in Chile,
where output is estimated to be down by 13 percent.
Borrowers in Asia have been less affected by the slowdown in bank
lending and the recession in the developed world. The top two Asian
borrowers, Korea and the Philippines, probably grew by about 5 and 3
percent respectively in 1982.
The volume of imports of non-OPEC developing countries in 1982,
down as much as 6 percent from 1981, is lower than their rate of growth
of income might imply. Exchange rate changes--sometimes extreme as in
the cases of Mexico and Argentina--and administrative controls on imports
have shifted demand to domestic goods. Major investment projects are cut
sharply when income growth slows and they have a very high import con-
tent. The direct effects of lower imports of productive inputs on growth
are delayed as inventories of imported goods are run down, but the 1982
import decline, plus a further decline in 1983, will significantly reduce
LDC growth next year.
The combined current account deficit of non-OPEC developing coun-
tries, about $75 billion in 1981, is expected to decline by about $15
billion in 1982. The sharp fall in imports will more than offset higher

IV -24
interest payments and a decline in the value of exports. Commodity
export prices appear to have bottomed out in the third quarter at their
lowest level since mid-1976. Relative to manufactured goods prices,
commodity prices are at their lowest level since the 1930's.
The countries which are most beset with financial problems are
heavily concentrated in Latin America and are traditional trading part-
ners of the United States. Hence, the United States absorbed a large
share of the decline in non-OPEC developing country imports in 1982.
Indeed, between the last quarter of 1981 and the third quarter of this
year, U.S. exports to Latin America, normally about 17 percent of U.S.
exports, declined by $7 billion at an annual rate, one third of the total
decline in U.S. exports in this period.
Update on Major Debt Negotiations
The IMF Executive Board is scheduled to approve on December 23 a
three-year $3.8 billion extended fund facility (EFF) drawing for Mexico.
One third of the amount would be disbursed each year. In partial
fulfillment of its commitments to the Fund, the Mexican government has
already taken several steps. Some public sector prices have been raised.
Exchange controls are to be partially lifted on December 20. The public
sector budget presented to the Mexican congress calls for a deficit of
1.5 trillion pesos, or 8.5 percent of GDP, the level specified in the IMF
agreement. The Mexican government plans to raise the value added tax,
impose a special income tax on upper-bracket incomes, more than double
the tax on dividends, and cut expenditures. Mexico has asked inter-
national banks to restructure about $20 billion in public sector debts
falling due between August 23, 1982 and the end of 1984 and has proposed

IV -25
to capitalize and convert to public sector debt private sector interest
payments due to foreign banks through January 1983. These payments may
amount to as much as $1.3 billion, of which about $900 million was over-
due as of early December.
Argentina has reached a tentative agreement with the IMF. Final
approval of the Argentinian $1.65 billion 14-month standby and a separate
drawing of $500-600 million on the compensatory financing facility for
export shortfalls (CFF) is expected in mid-January. Under an agreement
reached with a bank steering committee, international banks will provide
Argentina with a $1.1 billion bridging loan and $1.5 billion in new
credits.
Brazil is expected to receive $550 million from the IMF under a CFF
later this month. Negotiations on a $5 billion EFF drawing are likely to
result in initial disbursements in February or March of 1982. Brazil
recently obtained $760 million in 90-day bridge loans from several
commercial banks and is urgently seeking other short-term credits from
private and official sources. A $3 billion jumbo club loan for the first
quarter of 1983 is under negotiation. In addition, a recent $1.2 billion
official short-term borrowing from the United States has been disbursed.
