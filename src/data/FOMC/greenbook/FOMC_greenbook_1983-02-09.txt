The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity declined in the fourth quarter, but appeared
to be leveling off at year-end. Much of the drop in real GNP reflected
a large inventory liquidation in November. However, industrial production
stabilized in December, and recent data suggest that final demands have
firmed: housing activity continued to improve, consumer spending picked
up in late autumn, and the downward momentum in spending for capital
equipment appeared to be easing. The rate of inflation continued to improve
in December, and was below 5 percent in 1982 by virtually all measures.
Industrial Production and Employment
Industrial output edged down just 0.1 percent in December after
average monthly declines of almost 1 percent during the autumn. Output of
final products rose 0.3 percent. An upturn in auto assemblies and a rise
in output of defense equipment as well as a sharp increase in oil- and gas-
well drilling in December were offset by additional cutbacks in industries
with burdensome inventories. Output of durable home goods, business equip-
ment, and metals was curtailed further, although by a bit less than in
preceding months.
Early indications suggest that industrial production may have
turned up in January. The presumed improvement presumably was driven by
auto assemblies, which increased 10 percent to a 5.6 million unit annual
rate, as well as a sharp rise in raw steel production. Moreover, other
indicators suggest that activity in the industrial sector has strengthened:
new claims for unemployment insurance declined further during January,
and automakers announced recalls of workers in anticipation of a further

scaling up of assemblies. In addition, the recent increases in spot and
futures prices of industrialmaterials, particularly for copper and
other nonferrous metals, have been associated with reports of increased
demand. These positive signs were consistent with the survey of purchasing
managers that reported a firming of activity during January.
Despite the leveling off of production, nonfarm payroll employ-
ment in December fell 165,000--about the same as the average decline so
far in this recession--and the workweek was unchanged at a depressed
level. However, job losses in manufacturing slowed to a third of the
average monthly drop earlier in the year; rehiring at auto plants partly
offset continued weakness in machinery, and cutbacks in the metals indus-
tries were not as severe as in recent months. Employment at retail
stores fell another 65,000 in December; the cumulative loss of jobs
since the 1981 peak is about the same in relative terms as during the
1974-75 contraction. Construction employment continued to fall, partly
reflecting the decline in nonresidential building, which began last
summer; however, the overall weakness in construction employment may be
overstated because the establishment survey does not pick up new firms
that often are formed as residential construction recovers.
The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point in
December to 10.8 percent, after revision to the seasonal adjustment
factors. The overall jobless rate is now 1.8 percentage points higher
than the 1975 peak rate, but the differential is larger for adult men
and smaller for adult women. The particularly high jobless rate for
adult men partially reflects the cumulative effect of the prolonged
weakness in the industrial sector during the last three years. Since

the beginning of the recession, the overall labor-force participation
rate has remained relatively flat, in contrast to its earlier secular
rise. The number of discouraged workers rose another 200,000 in the
fourth quarter of 1982 and has climbed 800,000 since the second quarter
of 1981.
Inventory Investment
Recent adjustments in production and employment have reflected
efforts by firms to liquidate inventories in the face of the low level of
sales and high real credit costs. In November, these efforts were re-
inforced by an upturn in sales, and manufacturing and trade inventories
were slashed at an annual rate of $35.4 billion in 1972 dollars. Never-
theless, even though inventory holdings at the end of November were no
larger than in early 1981, sales had fallen to much lower levels, and
the response to this situation will continue to be a critical factor in
the near-term outlook for production.
Manufacturers reduced inventories at an annual rate of $18
billion in real terms during November, with liquidations reported for
virtually all key durable goods industries. Preliminary reports indicate
that manufacturers continued to liquidate inventories at a rapid rate in
December. Factory stocks were 3-1/4 percent below early 1981 levels,
but with shipments still 12 percent below the pace in the same period,
inventory-sales ratios remained only slightly below the peak levels of
last October. Producers of nonelectrical machinery and primary metals
continued to face the most serious imbalances between sales and inventories.
In the wholesale trade sector, where inventory changes have been
volatile, stocks were reduced in November at a $5.7 billion annual rate

in constant dollars. The stock-sales ratio fell a bit from October's
cyclical peak, but still remained very high.
Liquidation of retail trade inventories increased sharply in
November. A rapid runoff of stocks held by auto dealers accounted for
most of the decline, as auto sales were buoyed by financing concessions.
These concessions were extended to all domestic models at the beginning
of 1983, and, with January's cautious production schedules, dealer inven-
tories were apparently brought below 60 days supply, traditionally con-
sidered a comfortable level. Aside from autos, general merchandise stocks
were reduced in November, but inventory holdings were still much out of
line with sales.
Personal Income and Consumer Spending
Personal income grew somewhat faster in December than in the
previous four months, reflecting a boost from farm support payments. In
the private nonfarm sector, however, income growth remained very weak as
payrolls were about unchanged for the fifth consecutive month. For the
fourth quarter as a whole, personal income was supported by the growth of
unemployment insurance payments as well as the increase in farm income;
the number of claimants receiving regular unemployment insurance benefits
rose through early November, and the new Federal Supplemental Compensation
Program extended the period of eligibility for most claimants. Because of
the sharp cutback in aggregate hours worked, private wages and salaries
declined in the fourth quarter for the first time since the first quarter
of 1975. In addition, falling interest rates reduced the growth of interest
income.

Despite little income growth, consumer demand has been fairly
robust in recent months. Domestic auto sales averaged 6-1/2 million
units at an annual rate in November and December, benefiting from finan-
cing concessions on 1982 models. But 1983-model cars also have been
selling at a fairly brisk pace, representing the bulk of the 6.3 million
units sold in the first three weeks of January, as financing concessions
were extended to cover 1983 models as well. Demand for imported auto-
mobiles remained at a high 2.6 million unit annual pace in December,
capturing a record 29.6 percent share of all auto sales.
Outside the automotive area, retail sales for consumer goods
increased 0.7 percent in December, and increased in real terms as well.
Sales of general merchandise, furniture, and appliances advanced almost
2 percent in December; this was only partially offset by less spending
at apparel outlets and gasoline stations. Recent spending patterns are
consistent with the Michigan Survey that found an improvement in consumers'
appraisals of buying conditions for automobiles, houses, and large con-
sumer durables; more than half of the respondents thought it was a
good time to buy a car within the next year, the highest positive
response since 1978. Nevertheless, it is difficult to draw inferences
on the underlying demand for autos, because respondents in the Michigan.
Survey often react positively to special price concessions.
With consumption perking up toward year-end and payroll income
relatively flat, the personal saving rate dropped from an average of 6.7
percent in the first three quarters of the year to 5.8 percent in the
fourth quarter. The saving rate averaged about 6 percent during the last
5 years.

II-13
Housing
Activity in the housing market generally continued to trend up
as the cost of mortgage credit drifted lower. In December, private housing
starts fell a bit following a surge in November, but for the fourth quarter
as a whole, starts were nearly 45 percent above the cyclical low at the end
of 1981. All of the fourth quarter rise was for single-family units, as
starts of multifamily units edged down from the exceptional third-quarter
rate. At the same time, the number of building permits issued for resi-
dential construction rose further in December, mostly for multifamily
units; the advance in building permits has outpaced housing starts, as
happens from time to time during the early phases of housing recoveries.
Sales and prices of both new and existing houses have trended
up in recent months. Despite a decline in December, new home sales
in the fourth quarter were 43 percent above the recent cyclical low;
sales of existing homes were 12 percent higher. At the same time, the
average price of new homes sold edged up 1 percent from a year earlier;
existing home prices were up about 3 percent. However, both figures
may be influenced by changes in mix, quality, and financing concessions.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment declined sharply again in the
fourth quarter of 1982, bringing the rate of investment 8.4 percent
below its peak attained in the fourth quarter of 1981. The decline
was concentrated in producers' durable equipment, although the value
of nonresidential construction fell a bit over the second half of
last year and now appears to be in a downswing as well. This contraction

in construction has been fairly widespread, as spending for non-office
commercial buildings, public utility structures (for example, generating
plants), and oil- and gas-well drilling (GNP basis) all dropped somewhat.
Recent near-term indicators, while still depressed, have shown
some signs of revival. Orders for nondefense capital goods rose 2 percent
in December, and in the fourth quarter were almost 2.4 percent above the
third-quarter pace. In December, orders were about 3 percent below
shipments, a significant improvement from a gap that averaged 9 percent
for the first 11 months of 1982. A narrowing of the gap is a positive
sign because an increase in orders above the level of shipments will
eventually lead to an upturn in shipments as well.
In contrast, near-term indicators of nonresidential structures
suggest further declines in the months ahead. While construction of
commercial office buildings--about one-fifth of nonresidential structures--
continued to rise through most of 1982, it registered a decline in December.
In addition, vacancy rates jumped to a high level in the second half of
1982 and permits for nonresidential construction remained very low,
despite a 10.7 percent increase in November.
The annual Commerce Department Survey of plant and equipment
spending plans for 1983, taken in November and December, points to con-
tinued weakness this year. Businesses intend to lower nominal capital
spending by 1.3 percent in 1983. This translates into a 5.2 percent
real decline, given the respondents' inflation expectations of around 4
percent for capital goods, and follows a 4.8 percent real decline in

1982. Both the Merrill-Lynch and McGraw-Hill fall surveys are roughly
consistent with the Commerce survey. However, these capital spending
surveys generally overstate the weakness in investment at business cycle
troughs.
Federal Government
A sharp increase in federal purchases helped to boost the growth
of real final sales in the last quarter of 1982. Despite a deceleration
of defense spending from its rapid growth earlier in the year, total
federal purchases rose 28 percent at an annual rate. Most of the increase
reflected a further rise in Commodity Credit Corporation purchases to a
record level.
The federal government budget deficit was about $68 billion in
the final quarter of 1982, on a unified basis, compared with $48 billion
a year earlier (quarterly rates, not seasonally adjusted). The larger
deficit reflected a sharp rise of about $11 billion in expenditures and
a falloff in revenues of about $9 billion over the four-quarter period.
Almost half of the drop in revenues resulted from sagging corporate
taxes. In addition to the record CCC purchases, outlays were boosted by
sizable increases in defense and transfer payments.
In its "lame duck" session, Congress established basic funding
levels for the federal government for all of fiscal year 1983, partially
through appropriations bills and, for the remainder of government, through
a second continuing resolution. In total, last minute Congressional actions
appear to have raised outlays about $10 billion above levels consistent
with the earlier Congressional Budget Resolution; about a third of this amount
may be attributable to extended supplemental unemployment benefits and

II-20
the new highway program latter, of course, was offset by a tax in-
crease).
The Administration submitted a FY1984 budget at the end of
January. The document indicated that the Administration now anticipates
a FY1983 deficit of $208 billion and projects a $189 billion deficit for
1984. Details of the budget will be provided in the supplement to this
Greenbook.
Among other items, the budget requests an FY1984 freeze on
cost-of-living adjustments in federal government pay and benefits and
certain other programs and adopts the recommendations of the National
Commission on Social Security Reform that were submitted January 20. To
improve the ability of the social security system to meet its obligations
over the remainder of the decade, this Commission recommended (1) a six-
month deferral of the July 1983 cost-of-living adjustment, (2) partial
taxation of benefits received by upper income households, (3) acceleration
of payroll tax increases, and (4) a number of other changes, including
coverage for new Federal workers. According to the Commission report,
these recommendations are expected to inject about $170 billion into the
trust fund from 1983 through 1989.
State and Local Government
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local govern-
ments rose slightly in the fourth quarter, remaining almost unchanged
over the year as a whole. This contrasts with the steady decline in
real purchases over 1981. The increase during the fourth quarter of
1982 was concentrated in construction, which rose 9.4 percent at an
annual rate in real terms. In contrast, compensation, the largest

II-21
component of state and local government purchases, fell slightly in
real terms.
Inflation and Labor Costs
The consumer price index was about unchanged near year-end,
rising 0.1 percent in November and falling 0.3 percent in December. For
the year as a whole, the CPI rose 3.9 percent, less than half the 1981
pace. Producer prices of finished goods rose even less rapidly, 3-1/2
percent in 1982. Sharp declines in mortgage rates held down the CPI
last year, and weak markets for food and energy contributed to price
deceleration. But the reduction in inflation also occurred in many
other sectors. Prices of consumer commodities other than food, energy,
houses, and used cars rose 4 percent last year, the smallest increase
since 1972. Service prices, excluding energy items and homeownership
costs, advanced 7 percent last year, about 3-1/2 percentage points
less than their 1980-81 average.
In the investment sector, the easing of inflation also was
striking. Producer prices of capital equipment rose 4 percent, the
slowest pace since 1972. Construction prices, which are not reflected
adequately in the PPI or CPI, also slowed dramatically last year; the
price index for nonresidential structures advanced 3.4 percent over
the four quarters of last year, down from about 7-1/2 percent in 1981,
while prices for residential structures were actually flat for the
first time in more than a decade.
Labor costs also slowed further last year as wage increases
moderated in response to reduced inflation, high unemployment, and efforts

by employers to restore profits. Labor productivity posted a gain of 2.7
percent (annual rate) in the fourth quarter, and rose 1.9 percent over the
four quarters of 1982. While advances in productivity often occur near
cyclical troughs in overall activity, the recent increases in output per
hour appear somewhat better than would have been expected given the anemic
productivity performance of the 1970's and the drop in output last year.
Virtually all wage measures slowed to around 6 percent in
1982, compared with 8 to 10 percent in the preceding year. Wages for
production workers, as measured by the hourly earnings index, decelerated
to 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, following a 6-1/2 percent pace
earlier in the year. The slowing was especially noticeable in manufac-
turing where concessions in some industries, such as autos, had eliminated
annual improvement factors and some cost-of-living adjustments. Earnings
of white-collar workers also began to slow in 1982. Hourly compensation--
which includes fringe benefits as well as wages and salaries--rose at a 6
percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, bringing the four-quarter in-
crease in 1982, at 6-1/2 percent, to the lowest rate since the period of
wage and price controls in 1972.
Recent trends in collective bargaining point to further improve-
ment in wage trends this year. The slowing last year in overall wage
increases for the 8-1/2 million workers covered by major union contracts
involving 1,000 or more workers, from 9.5 percent in 1981 to 6.7 percent,
was attributable to both reduced COLAs and to smaller new settlements.
New settlements in 1982 were dominated by wage concessions made
early in the year. For the year as a whole, unionized workers negotiated

II-25
wage increases that averaged 3.8 percent in the first contract year;
when they last bargained almost 3 years ago, the same parties received
first-year wage adjustments of 7.9 percent. Much of the deceleration in
union wages last year occurred because almost half of bargaining workers
received no scheduled wage increases, although most will receive COLAs.
In addition, many workers--particularly auto workers and truckers--who
reached agreements in 1982 will receive no annual improvement factor over
the life of their contracts; this should moderate union wage change over
the next two years.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Growth in the monetary aggregates was exceptionally rapid in January,
with expansion in M2 surpassing previous records by a wide margin. Move-
ments in the aggregates were distorted by shifts into the newly authorized
money market deposit accounts and, to a lesser extent, super NOW accounts.
The heavily promoted MMDAs, in many cases offered at yields far above mar-
ket interest rates, prompted large shifts among the components of M2, and
evidently attracted substantial amounts of funds from large time deposits
and other market instruments.
Market interest rates have changed relatively little on balance since
the December FOMC meeting. After moving down at first, rates more recently
have firmed as market expectations of a further cut in the discount rate
were damped by the rapid growth in the aggregates, increased focus on
federal financing requirements, and some signs of strengthening in the
economy. Lagging behind other rates, both the bank prime lending rate to
business and the mortgage commitment rate at S&Ls dropped about 50 basis
points. In consumer credit markets, the automobile finance companies
extended their reduced-rate lending programs to cover all 1983 models as
well as leftover 1982 vehicles.
The Treasury has continued to raise large amounts of funds, as feder-
al cash needs in the current quarter rival the record fourth-quarter volume.
Borrowing by state and municipal units slackened somewhat in January with
the passing of certain year-end borrowing deadlines, but has remained strong
by pre-1982 standards. Nonfinancial businesses continued to lengthen the
maturity structure of their debt last month, issuing new bonds in the domes-
tic and Euro- markets while repaying part of their shorter-term debt. In

the closing months of 1982, households stepped up their installment borrow-
ing and arrangement of commitments for home mortgage loans; with this
momentum and the further decline in credit costs, it seems likely that net
credit flows to this sector continued to expand moderately in January.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Recent money stock behavior has been influenced greatly by the intro-
duction of the MMDA in mid-December and the super NOW account in early
January.1  Owing to heavy promotional activity and above-market offering
rates that have dropped moderately from initial levels, depository institu-
tions have received massive inflows to MMDAs, which by late January reached
$200 billion in total. Commercial banks have garnered about 60 percent of
these deposits.
Super NOW accounts--introduced on January 5 with less fanfare and
substantially lower interest rates than MMDAs, as well as hefty fees on
small or medium-sized accounts-appear to have attracted smaller, though
still significant, inflows. Super NOWs totaled about $16 billion in the
second statement week after their introduction. This buildup partly
reflected reallocations within M1, and inflows to super NOWs from outside
M1 were roughly offset by outflows from M1 balances into MMDAs. Still,
Ml expansion picked up to an estimated 12 percent annual rate in January
after a dip in December to just below the double-digit pace of the preced-
ing four months, a rebound which suggests that the underlying demand for
Ml remains strong.
M2 growth soared to a record 31 percent annual rate in January as
a result of sizable inflows to MMDAs from non-M2 sources. Nevertheless,

inflows to MMDAs from outside M2 were small relative to shifts originating
within the nontransactions component of M2. Substantial amounts were trans-
ferred from retail RPs and 7- to 31-day deposits that had been widely used
as "bridge" accounts for MMDAs, but other small time deposits, passbook
savings accounts, and shares in money market mutual funds all declined
markedly as well. Outflows from the M2-type money funds amounted to about
$25 billion between the mid-December introduction of MMDAs and late January.
M3 growth, though projected to have picked up to a 13 percent annual
rate in January from the weak December pace, was well below M2 growth in
both months, as large time deposits and shares in institution-only MMMFs
contracted sharply. Declines in large time deposits partly reflected
direct shifting to MMDAs and partly curtailment of CD issuance by deposi-
tory institutions in response to the surge in "core" deposits.1 Some of
the decline in institutional MMMFs may also have resulted from transfers
to MMDAs, but it seems more likely that investors were reacting primarily
to the higher returns available on competing market instruments, particu-
larly during late December. More recently, with money fund yields improv-
ing again relative to other market rates, institution-only funds have rea-
lized a moderate net inflow.
Growth in bank credit rebounded in December to a 10-1/2 percent annual
rate, as banks increased their lending and made substantial purchases of
securities. Although business lending remained weak in December, security
loans expanded sharply and real estate and consumer loans picked up. Early
1. Large banks also appear to have adjusted to soaring inflows to core
deposits by making record advances to their foreign branches. A portion
of these advances likely replenished losses of funds arising from liquida-
tion of Eurodollar CDs held by MMMFs.

indications are that bank credit growth remained strong in January, led by
further large acquisitions of securities, especially Treasuries.
Business Finance
Net funds raised in markets by nonfinancial corporations plunged in
the fourth quarter of 1982, according to preliminary estimates, as firms
curtailed expenditures for fixed capital and liquidated inventories at a
brisk pace. With yields in stock and bond markets down considerably from
mid-1982, businesses concentrated their fund-raising in the longer-term
securities markets, issuing large amounts of long-term debt and equity.
At the same time, business loans at banks contracted during the final two
months of 1982, and outstanding commercial paper, which had begun to
decline in August, continued to run off sharply through year-end.

III-8
Domestic bond offerings dropped off in January, but a sharp increase
in bonds sold abroad appears to have left total issuance for the month
about unchanged from December. Fewer domestic issues in January carried
maturities of 20 years or longer; a relatively large number of issues
had maturities under 10 years, suggesting that both borrowers and lenders
remain cautious about the longer term. Part of the shortening of maturi-
ties reflected a larger proportion of offerings by financial firms, which
typically rely more on intermediate-term instruments. In addition, maturi-
ties in the Eurobond market typically are less than 10 years.
Many of the issues sold abroad recently have permitted buyers to
defer a significant portion of the payment for six to eight months.1  Ini-
tial payments for such bonds have ranged in most cases between 10 and 30
percent of their face value. The value placed by investors on the deferral
privilege has been reflected in lower yields than could be obtained on regu-
lar issues in the U.S. market. Recent reports in the financial press, indi-
cating that several partly paid bond offerings have sold quite slowly, sug-
gest that their popularity may be limited, however.
Major indexes of stock prices have moved up 3 to 10 percent since the
December meeting of the FOMC, with several reaching record highs during the
intermeeting period. Since the start of the recent bull market in mid-
August, stock averages have climbed 40 to 55 percent. Gross offerings of
stocks in December reached $3.3 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis,
before subsiding a bit in January. Higher stock prices have also continued
1. Because buyers of partly paid bonds can walk away from the obligation
by forfeiting their initial payment, the issuers of these bonds might have
to refinance the deferred portion in the next few months, but only if inter-
est rates rise substantially.

to encourage convertible bond offerings, especially by lower-rated firms
seeking to minimize financing costs.

quarter totaled almost $59 billion to help meet a combined budget deficit
of $69 billion. An anticipated first-quarter deficit of $66 billion is
expected to generate another $52 billion of marketable borrowing, with the
remainder likely to be financed by about $1-1/2 billion of nonmarketable
issues and a reduction of about $9-1/2 billion in the Treasury's cash bal-
ance. The staff's estimate of marketable borrowing for the first quarter
is about $7 billion below the Treasury's estimate because of differences
in forecasts of the unified budget deficit.
Nonmarketable borrowing has increased significantly in recent months.
It had declined more than $6 billion in the first three quarters of 1982,
but rose $3-1/2 billion in the fourth quarter. Much of the unusually large
volume of nonmarketable borrowing has come from special issues in which
state and local governments temporarily invest receipts from refinancing
operations. These operations picked up significantly in the fourth quarter,
primarily because interest rates declined sufficiently to make refinancing
more attractive to state and local governments. At current municipal inter-
est rate levels, refinancings are expected to be strong again in the first
quarter.
In the fourth quarter, the Treasury also raised $700 million in new
cash through savings bonds, and a like amount is expected in the first
quarter. The renewed growth of savings bonds appears to be attributable

to the new program under which rates paid on savings bonds held to maturity
are linked to the average yield on 5-year Treasury notes.
In December, federally sponsored credit agencies borrowed an estimated
$1.3 billion, after running off debt in October and November. FNMA borrowed
over $3 billion in December, using about $1.7 billion to finance new mort-
gage purchases and the remainder to increase its liquid assets. The FHLBs,
in contrast, again paid down debt in December as thrift institutions contin-
ued to repay outstanding advances. Lending by the Federal Farm Credit Banks
remained weak in the final month of the year, and these agencies also reduced
their outstanding debt. This pattern of agency activity appears to have
continued in January, with only FNMA raising new money and with the FHLBs
likely paying off about $1.5 billion in debt.
State and local sector. Prompted by declining interest rates and
approaching deadlines on issuance of certain types of securities, borrow-
ing by state and local governments was extraordinarily heavy in the fourth
quarter of 1982. Flotation of long-term securities crested to a record
$9.8 billion in December as many issuers rushed to the market in anticipa-
tion of the scheduled January 1 date for a federal requirement that all
municipal bonds be issued in registered form. In mid-December this date
was postponed for six months, and borrowing slackened in the weeks immedi-
ately following. Gross issuance during January as a whole was still esti-
mated to be quite strong at $5.3 billion, seasonally adjusted, as the fun-
damental factors of lower interest rates and weakness in revenues asserted
themselves. In recent weeks, there have been a number of reports of bigger-
than-expected budget deficits of state and local governments. Nonetheless,
market access evidently has not been impaired, and yield spreads have
remained moderate.

1. These numbers do not include tax-exempt commercial paper.
Revenue issues continued to dominate activity in the tax-exempt mar-
ket, accounting for about three fourths of total volume in December and
January, a proportion very near the average for the past three years. The
largest single category in December was mortgage revenue bonds. Issuers
of these obligations were anxious to use up their annual volume limitations
which cannot be carried over into the next calendar year. Issues to finance
hospitals and public utilities also were sizable. Taken together, these
three revenue bond categories made up about 45 percent of total tax-exempt
securities volume in 1982.
Individuals remain the main category of purchasers of new municipal
issues. Net new purchases of long-term securities by individuals through
bond funds--unit investment trusts (UITs) and open-end mutual funds--came
to about $2-1/4 billion in December. Sales of UITs were a record $13-1/4
billion in 1982, almost three times the previous $5.3 billion record set in

III-13
1981. By contrast, commercial banks and property/casualty insurance com-
panies--the traditional institutional investors in tax-exempts--have shown
little interest in such investments over the past two years.
Mortgage Markets
Despite quite recent reports of an upturn in rates in several regions,
the average interest rate on new commitments for long-term, fixed-rate con-
ventional home mortgages at S&Ls has fallen by about 1/2 percentage point
since the December FOMC meeting to 13.10 percent--nearly 4 percentage points
below the recent high last July and 5-1/2 points below the cyclical peak in
the fall of 1981.
As rates have declined, the volume of applications for federally
underwritten as well as conventional home loans generally has risen. New
mortgage commitments issued by S&Ls rose to $8.9 billion in December, after
seasonal adjustment, and the stock of commitments outstanding climbed to
$29.5 billion--the highest since late 1979. The surge in activity, of
course, reflects refinancing of outstanding high-rate loans as well as
funding of real estate construction and home sales transactions. On a net
basis, mortgage-related assets at S&Ls (mortgage loans and mortgage pass-
through securities combined) increased $1.5 billion in December, and the
rise for the fourth quarter as a whole was nearly double that of the pre-
vious quarter.
The past several months saw a substantial narrowing of the gap between
average commitment and closing rates on conventional home loans at institu-
tional lenders. This gap had reached unprecedented proportions in 1981 and
early last year, reflecting not only time lags between commitment and clos-
ing, but also the inclusion in the closing rate series of adjustable-rate

loans (generally with initial rates below those on fixed-rate contracts)
and fixed-rate loans made at below-market rates--such as builder buy-downs,
"blends," and loans made from the proceeds of tax-exempt mortgage revenue
bonds. The recent narrowing of the gap reflects timing to some degree,
but also signals a decline in the importance of adjustable-rate mortgages
and presumably also of below-market-rate financing. The proportion of
adjustable-rate loans among loans closed at institutional lenders fell in
December for the fourth consecutive month. Moreover, as market rates have
plummeted, the need for blended-rate arrangements and builder buy-downs has
weakened and the competitive advantage of funds raised earlier by municipal-
ities through mortgage revenue bonds has dwindled.
Although yields have declined sharply since late 1981 on long-term,
fixed-rate mortgages and on mortgage pass-through securities, they have
come down less than yields on bonds of similar quality and maturity, and
spreads between mortgage rates and bond rates have widened accordingly.
In fact, the spread between yields on new issues of GNMAs and 10-year Trea-
sury bonds has trended upward since 1978; over the same period, the spread
between rates on new commitments for conventional home mortgages and yields
on recently offered corporate bonds has widened by roughly the same amount.
These long-run changes in yield spreads occurred as net investment
in mortgage-related assets by thrift institutions fell to historically low
levels, in both absolute terms and as a share of the market. While the
persistence of such large yield spreads might suggest a mortgage credit
"availability" problem, the rise in both the GNMA-Treasury and the mortgage-
corporate bond yield spreads more likely has been associated with increases
in the price charged by investors for the prepayment (call) option owned

by mortgage borrowers--an option that had grown in value as interest rate
uncertainty increased. The prices that investors will pay for prepayable
(FHA/VA and conventional) and assumable (FHA/VA) fixed-rate mortgages
reportedly have declined relative to prices they will pay for investments
with greater yield certainty--as evidenced by preferences of pension funds
and life insurance companies for deep-discount mortgage securities that
have a relatively low probability of early refinancing.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding rose during November at an
annual rate of 9 percent, by far the fastest pace in more than a year.
Automobile credit, which increased at a 17 percent annual rate on the
strength of price reductions and special financing concessions offered
by auto manufacturers, accounted for over two thirds of the expansion.
Incoming information suggests that consumer installment lending may have
strengthened a bit further in December. Commercial banks maintained their
more vigorous pace of lending, and auto finance companies broadened their
below-market financing programs begun a month or two earlier. A spot
check on February 1 of commercial banks by five Federal Reserve banks indi-
cated that average interest rates on most types of consumer loans (except
credit card borrowings) have fallen as much as 1 percentage point since
the last full survey in early November.
In early January, all four U.S. auto manufacturers announced new
special programs lasting through the end of March that offer financing at
11.9 percent to buyers of almost all 1982 and 1983 models. The special
rate is about 5 percentage points below typical rates prior to the pro-
gram. General Motors is offering financing through GMAC while Chrysler,

III-18
Ford and AMC--in addition to providing credit through finance subsidi-
aries--are subsidizing customer financing at participating creditors.
Under the latter arrangement, customers pay an 11.9 percent finance charge;
the auto company makes up the difference, in a lump sum payment to the
creditor, between the reduced customer rate and a standard finance rate
for automobile credit.1
Despite continued high unemployment rates and only modest increases
in disposable personal income, indicators of repayment difficulties on
consumer installment debt have remained little changed from previous low
levels. During the fourth quarter, on average, and for 1982 as a whole,
1.67 percent of automobile credit contracts at finance companies were
delinquent by 30 days or more. This was the lowest delinquency rate at
these firms for any year on record, and compared with 1.90 percent in 1981.
Other installment loan delinquency series are not yet available for the
fourth quarter. Personal bankruptcy cases filed during the fourth quarter
of 1982 rose by only about 1 percent from the third quarter pace, continu-
ing the trendless performance of the past two years. Delinquency rates on
mortgage loans, however, remain in a marked uptrend.
1. Automobile dealers also participate in the finance rate subsidy by for-
going some or all of the share of finance charge revenue they normally
obtain for arranging financing with banks or finance companies. One likely
consequence of requiring dealers to give up finance charge income is less
flexibility in price bargaining with customers who wish to obtain 11.9 per-
cent financing. Thus, the favorable effect of lower financing costs on
auto demand may be offset somewhat by less accommodative pricing of cars.

Appendix A*
MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNT AND SUPER NOW ACCOUNT DEVELOPMENTS
The growth and composition of the monetary aggregates have
been profoundly influenced by the introduction of the money market
deposit account (MMDA) and the super NOW account. Both of these
instruments are ceiling free for accounts that maintain an average
balance of $2,500.1 The MMDA has limited transaction capabilities
allowing up to six automatic, preauthorized or telephone transfers
per month (three of the six transfers can be by draft).2 The super
NOW account is fully transactional and is available to individuals,
governmental units, and certain not-for-profit organizations.3 For
both of the new accounts institutions can guarantee a rate for up to
a month, and the MMDA can even be issued with a specific term to
maturity of up to 30 days.
Commercial banks and thrift institutions have marketed the MMDA
aggressively. As early as November of last year many institutions
were offering high yielding "bridge" accounts to attract deposits
before the official introduction of the MMDA on December 14.4 With
the shifting of balances from "bridge" accounts and the heavy promo-
tion of the MMDA itself, the new accounts grew rapidly in December
and inflows continued to be robust through late January. As shown in
the upper panel of table A-1, balances in MMDAs averaged $190 billion
in the week ending January 19.
One factor obviously contributing to the buildup in MMDAs has
been the relatively high interest rates offered on these accounts.
Based on data collected from a sample of institutions, it is estima-
ted that the average effective yield on MMDAs was about 10-1/2 percent
at commercial banks and around 11 percent at thrifts as of the end of
December. These rates were about 2 to 2-1/2 percentage points above
the average yield posted by money market mutual funds at that time.
Information available as of late January indicates that average yields
on MMDAs had fallen by about one percentage point, but the differential
1. At the discretion of the institution, the average balance can be
determined over any period up to one month.
2. There is no limit on the number of withdrawals made in person.
3. On March 1, 1983, the Depository Institutions Deregulation Com-
mittee will consider a proposal to make available to all businesses
a fully transactional account that pays explicit interest.
4. Retail RPs and 7- to 31-day accounts were the most popular "bridge"
accounts.

between commercial banks and thrift institutions continued, and both
types of institutions were paying in excess of money market mutual
fund yields.
Despite the somewhat higher average rate on MMDAs at thrift
institutions, commercial banks appear to have attracted a relatively
large proportion of the MMDA market when compared to their share of
combined savings, small time deposits and MMDAs. The lower panel of
table A-1 indicates that in early January 60 percent of the MMDA bal-
ances were held at commercial banks, even though these depositories
accounted for less than half of savings, small time, and MMDA bal-
ances.1 A comparison of the first two columns of the lower panel of
table A-1 also suggests that larger institutions as a group had a
disproportionately large share of MMDAs. However, given that MMDAs
can be issued in large denominations and to business customers, it
also may be useful to compare MMDA shares with total deposit shares,
including large CDs, shown in the third column. In light of this
comparison, it is less clear that banks had an advantage over thrifts
or that large institutions systematically outperformed smaller insti-
tutions.2
The growth in super NOWs, which were introduced on January 5,
has been dwarfed by the flows into MMDAs. For the week of January 19,
super NOWs averaged about $15-1/2 billion (see table A-2), with over
half of the increase occurring in the first two days that the account
was offered. Based on information from the Reserve Bank Contact
Group and other sources, it appears that interest rates on super NOWs
averaged one to two percentage points below rates on MMDAs. Such a
differential is in line with what would be expected given the differ-
ence in reserve requirements on a transaction account and the MMDA.
As with the MMDA, thrifts apparently were offering higher rates than
commercial banks on super NOWs in January.
The attractiveness of the super NOW for many depositors likely
is limited by hefty service charges that many institutions are applying
to the new account. Such fees can take the form of monthly maintenance
charges that can be $20 or more (though are typically less), charges
per transaction, or a combination of the two. In many cases, these
service charges are waived if account balances are above some threshold
1. Figures on table A-1 exclude credit union deposits; these institu-
tions have only a small fraction of deposits classified as MMDAs.
2. It should be noted that in January there was quite a large differ-
ence in the growth.rates of combined savings, small time deposits, and
MMDAs at commercial banks and thrifts. Part of this difference could
be due to commercial banks getting a large share of the large-denomina-
tion time deposits that may have been converted into MMDAs. However,
it also is possible that commercial banks captured the bulk of the
nondeposit funds that were shifted to MMDAs.

III-A-3
level, such as $5,000 or $10,000. Given the size of some of these
service charges and the fact that individuals generally cannot deduct
the fees for income tax purposes, it is possible that an ordinary NOW
account with no fees would be preferred by many depositors.
As in the case of MMDAs, commercial banks account for most of
the super NOW balances. However, the commercial bank share of super
NOWs may be less than would be expected given the concentration of
transaction balances at these institutions. As indicated in table
A-2, the ratio of super NOWs to total OCD in the week of January 12
was only about 8 percent at banks, compared with 18 percent at thrift
institutions. The proportion of OCD held in super NOWs also was quite
different among thrift institutions. The rather high ratio for credit
unions most likely reflects the ability of these institutions to offer
ceiling-free share draft accounts even prior to the Depository
Institutions Deregulation Committee's decision to authorize a super
NOW. As a result, many credit unions already were paying more than
5-1/4 percent on transaction deposits and these balances automatically
would be reported as super NOWs. Some of the growth in super NOWs at
S&Ls, on the other hand, could be related to the relatively large
volume of funds that these institutions maintained in sweep arrange-
ments involving ordinary NOWs and retail RPs or money market mutual
funds.1 Reports from the Reserve Bank Contact Group indicate that some
institutions did not plan to continue offering sweeps for transaction
accounts, while some others were encouraging customers with sweep
arrangements to convert to a super NOW.
1. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board estimates that funds in sweep
arrangements linking NOW accounts to retail RPs or to money market
funds amounted to about $5-1/2 billion in November, 1982. About $1
billion of the total was in NOW accounts and the remaining $4-1/2
billion primarily was in retail RPs.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the December FOMC meeting the weighted average value of the
dollar has appreciated by roughly 2-1/2 percent on balance, as shown by
the chart on the next page. The dollar declined by several percent
through early January to a trough 8-1/2 percent below its peak in early
November. Most of the depreciation over that two-month period was
attributed to upward revisions in market expectations about the size of
prospective U.S. trade and current account deficits. By the beginning of
January, however, market expectations that the Federal Reserve would
allow monetary conditions to ease further appeared also to be contrib-
uting to the dollar's slide. During the second half of January the
dollar appreciated by more than 5 percent as the absence of a discount
rate reduction and the focus of attention on large prospective U.S.
budget deficits led to a sharp rise in market perceptions of the prob-
ability that dollar interest rates would not decline further in the near
term.
On a bilateral basis, the dollar has appreciated by more than 5
percent against the pound since the December FOMC meeting, while rising 3
percent against the mark and changing little on balance against the yen.
Since early-November the dollar has declined by nearly 15 percent against
the yen and 5 percent against the mark, while rising nearly 10 percent
against the pound. The pound has been weakened by the failure of the
OPEC countries to reach a production agreement that might have arrested
the downward pressure on oil prices. Part of the recent weakening of the
mark relative to the yen has been associated with a growing sense that

the German general elections on March 6 may not give a clear majority
vote to the current conservative government.
Except in the United Kingdom, interest rates abroad have declined
or remained steady since the December FOMC meeting. Official lending
rates have been lowered by 1 percentage point in Sweden and 1/2 percent-
age point in the Netherlands. The depreciation of the mark and the yen
against the dollar during the second half of January dampened market
expectations of imminent reductions in the German and Japanese discount
rates. The depreciation of the pound led the Bank of England to tighten
monetary conditions, pushing sterling interest rates up by about 1 per-
centage point since mid-December. Gold prices have risen from around
$440 an ounce in mid-December to around $500 an ounce at the beginning of
February.
.The Irish pound has joined the
Belgian franc at the bottom of the EMS, with both currencies presently
trading around their lower intervention limits against the Netherlands
guilder. The weakening of the Irish pound has been related to the
decline of sterling, reflecting the close trading links between the Irish
and British economies.

On January 26 the Treasury repaid at maturity the balance of its
Swiss-franc denominated Carter notes. The remaining mark-denominated
Carter notes will mature in May and July.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Over the period from December to mid-January U.S. banking offices
(including IBFs) have made net advances to their foreign offices of
about $13 billion (see line la below), more than reversing the inflow
in October and November. Over 75 percent of this large outflow was
reported by U.S. chartered banks (line 1b below), and more than fifty
percent of the total outflow of funds by U.S. chartered banks was
attributable to the nine largest money center banks.

Changes in the pattern of financial flows related to the
introduction of the new money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) in
mid-December probably are reflected in the recent outflow. Part of
the flow was probably caused by investors directly or indirectly
substituting these new accounts for part of their holdings of foreign
branch Eurodollar liabilities (such as Eurodollar CDs), inducing
U.S. banks to replace these funds at their foreign offices.
Available data indicate that some indirect substitution has occurred:
about one-fourth of the 13 percent decline in the assets of money
market mutual funds over the period from December to mid-January
reflected a $6.5 billion drop in their holdings of Eurodollar assets.
In addition, although the new account does not appear to have been
structured to be directly competitive with Eurodollar instruments,
there may have been some direct shifts of Eurodollar deposits to MMDAs.
In addition, several banks have indicated that they have placed the
proceeds of MMDA related inflows in the Eurodollar interbank market.
Such placements currently offer more attractive yields than domestic
liquid assets such as Treasury securities or overnight Federal Funds.
This increase in the use of the Euro-interbank market, after a period
of noted hesitancy, may also reflect an increased concern at these
banks about earnings rather than financial ratios, such as the return
on assets.

Transactions on a balance of payments basis in U.S. official
reserve assets (net of Carter Bonds) generated an increase of $6.8
billion in 1982, a slight decrease relative to 1981. Such increases in
U.S. official reserve assets add to the Treasury's borrowing
requirements from the public. During 1982 the rise in official reserve
assets was primarily due to an increase of $2.6 billion in the U.S.
reserve position at the I.M.F. and to a $2.8 billion increase in
foreign currency holdings. Virtually, the entire increase in net
transactions in foreign currency during 1982 reflected U.S. swap
credits to Brazil and Mexico (see the line "Other" in the Table
below).

In November private foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate
stocks and bonds were only about $400 million (see lines 2a and 2b of
the attached Table). These relatively small foreign net purchases
perhaps reflected investor expectations that the dollar would weaken
against other currencies, as occurred during November. However, U.S.
Eurodollar bond issues were substantial in November and January.
Over 60 percent of the dollar amount of such issues have been offered
on a partial payment basis, enabling investors to take a position on
U.S. dollar exchange rate and interest rate movements. Such issues
usually specify that the investor pay a portion of the purchase price
initially (from 15 to 25 percent) with the balance due in six months or
more at the original purchase price and coupon. The issuer pays
interest on the initial payment for the six month period only if the
purchaser completes payment on the bond at the end of this period.
News accounts have reported that Japanese investors have been
particularly heavy buyers of these securities, perhaps because of the
restrictions on their participation in trading in organized futures
exchanges. Net proceeds of these issues in November and January
amounted to $450 million with about $1.3 billion still to be raised if
investors buy the rest of these issues. It is important to note that
interest rates would hve to rise by a substantial amount relative to
their current levels (i.e. 15 to 20 percent) for investors not to
excersise the option of buying the remainder of a bond offered on a
partial payment basis.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In December, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was smaller than
in November or October, but for the quarter as a whole the deficit was
nearly the same as the large third quarter deficit. In the fourth
quarter both exports and imports declined moderately.
Only a small part of the export decline in the fourth quarter was
in agricultural shipments. A pickup in corn exports (primarily to the
U.S.S.R.) partly offset sharp declines in shipments of wheat and
soybeans (to China and Japan respectively). Agricultural export prices
turned up slightly in December. Most of the decline in the fourth
quarter in nonagricultural exports was-in response to sluggish economic

activity in major trading partner countries and the high exchange
value of the dollar. Substantial declines have occurred in
manufactured goods such as machinery, chemicals, aircraft, and
automotive exports to Canada. By area, 35 percent of the decline in
nonagricultural exports since mid-1982 was in shipments to Mexico;
42 percent of the change was to industrial countries, particularly
Canada and Australia/New Zealand.
Oil imports declined marginally in the fourth quarter; in fact,
in the second half of the year the volume of oil imports was 10 percent
above the first-half rate. The increase appears to be largely refined
products from Western Europe and Latin America (other than Mexico)
which contributed to a small build-up in inventories. U.S. domestic
oil consumption dropped markedly in the fourth quarter. Average
import prices declined by about 25 cents per barrel in the fourth
quarter.

IV-13
The volume of nonoil imports declined sharply in the fourth
quarter in response to declining U.S. economic activity, with
decreases spread among most major commodity categories --
particularly industrial supplies (steel), machinery, automotive
imports from Canada (and to a lesser extent from Japan and Europe),
and consumer goods.
For the year 1982 as a whole, there was a distinct shift in
the trade balance at mid-year; from quarterly deficits of less than
$25 billion annual rate in the first two quarters, the deficits rose
to about a $50 billion annual rate beginning in the third quarter.
Exports dropped sharply in the second half of the year --
agricultural exports declined from relatively strong levels recorded
during the past several years and nonagricultural exports continued
declines begun in mid-1981. Imports, however, were only marginally
higher in the second half of this year than in the first. There were
several major influences on these trade developments. The decrease
in exports reflected a decline in foreign demand for U.S. goods
(a combined effect of slow economic growth abroad, loss of price
competitiveness of U.S. goods because of the high exchange value of
the dollar, and, in the case of U.S. grain, ample alternative
supplies); in addition constrained financial conditions in some
developing countries, i.e. Mexico, also held down exports. For
imports, the effect of sluggish U.S. economic activity was partly
offset by the increased price competitiveness of foreign goods.

IV -14
Foreign Economic Developments. Real GNP in major foreign
industrial countries declined on average in the third quarter of last
year. Only one major country, Japan, recorded positive growth in that
quarter. This weakness abroad continued into the fourth quarter with
industrial production generally declining to November. The level of
industrial production in November was below its year-earlier level in
all countries. For some major countries, such as the United Kingdom,
Canada and Germany, industrial production has fallen to levels not seen
since 1975-76. The rate of unemployment abroad has risen further in
the fourth quarter, reaching nearly 13 percent in December in Canada
and the United Kingdom and about 9 percent in Germany, France and Italy.
While these data show continued weakness in the foreign econo-
mies, there have been some as yet tentative indications that activity
could strengthen soon in several countries. Residential construction
has been quite strong in Germany for about two quarters and more
recently also in Canada. The volume of orders rose in November-
December in Germany for the first time in a year. Survey results in
Canada, France and Germany have recently shown less pessimism than
previously by consumers as well as producers. In the United Kingdom
the seasonally adjusted volume of retail sales rose strongly in
December.
Despite weak economic activity, fiscal policy remains tight in most
foreign countries as concerns over rising budget deficits limit
anticyclical responses. Monetary policy, on the other hand, may be
characterized as continuing to ease cautiously. Real interest rates
abroad appear to have declined further in recent months to a level
below a year ago in most countries.

IV -15
In Japan, industrial production declined slightly in December
after a strong gain in November. As a result, fourth-quarter
production was below its third-quarter level. Wholesale price and
consumer price indices have shown little tendency to rise and in some
cases fell in the last quarter of 1982. Japan's exports rose slightly
in December after an eight month decline to November. Imports fell
strongly in December. As a result, Japan's trade surplus (s.a.) rose
to $1.4 billion in December from $1.0 billion in November. The current
account showed a surplus of $7.3 billion in 1982, compared to a surplus
of $4.6 billion in the previous year.
The preliminary budget for fiscal 1983 has been announced by the
new government formed by Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro. Proposed
nominal expenditures are only 1.4 percent larger than expenditures
under the 1982 budget. This is the first Japanese budget since 1955 to
plan a decline in real terms. It is most likely that government
expenditures in 1983 will not be stimulatory. Monetary policy remains
fairly restrictive. The monetary authorities continue to hew to the
line of modest monetary growth and hestitate to undertake a reduction
in the official discount rate despite an almost 13 percent appreciation
of the yen against the dollar by the end of January over its November
average value.
In Germany, third-quarter real GNP fell at an annual rate of over
5 percent, and preliminary reports, which put the year-over-year
decline of 1982 GNP at 1.1 percent, imply a further decline in the
fourth quarter. Industrial production continued to fall in December to
a level 6 percent below the beginning of last year. The rate of

IV -16
unemployment reached 8.5 percent (s.a.) in December, which represents
about 2.1 million unemployed.
While these data leave no doubt about the severity of the current
recession, there are some signs that the worst may be over. The volume
of orders, having fallen steadily through October last year, rose
strongly in November and December. Part of this rise is probably due
to the end-of-year deadline for last year's investment credit program,
and orders of investment goods indeed show the strongest gains. But
other sectors, such as consumer goods and primary goods, especially in
terms of foreign orders, have also shown strength. The latest survey
findings judge the business climate less pessimistically than
previously.
Consumer price inflation has declined by about 2 percentage
points during 1982 with a year-over-year result of 5.3 percent. The
marked slowdown of inflation toward the end of last year came just in
time to provide a favorable input into this year's wage bargaining.
Although no major contracts have yet been signed, indications are that
an average outcome of below 4 percent may be expected. Last year's
contractual wages rose by 4.3 percent.
Germany's current account, which was in deficit by $7.6 billion
in 1981, showed a surplus of $2 billion last year. This $9.6 billion
improvement is essentially to be found in the trade balance, which
improved in volume terms as a lagged result of the past weakness of the
D-mark and in unit value terms -- especially later during the year --
as the D-mark appreciated on an effective basis.
The economic policy mix continues in its atypical constellation
of an easing monetary policy and a very tight fiscal policy. The

IV -17
improvement is essentially to be found in the trade balance, which
improved in volume terms as a lagged result of the past weakness of the
D-mark and in unit value terms -- especially later during the year --
as the D-mark appreciated on an effective basis.
The economic policy mix continues in its atypical constellation
of an easing monetary policy and a very tight fiscal policy. The
conservative government came to office with its fiscal agenda having a
high priority and has used its probation period before the March 6
elections to legislate a host of cuts in social services. The
Bundesbank. on the other hand, has continued its policy of cautious
easing. Central Bank money grew by 6.2 percent between the fourth
quarters of 1981 and 1982, which is in the upper half of the 4 to 7
percent target.
In Canada, the consumer price index was virtually unchanged in
December and the average monthly change over the last six months of
1982 was under 1/2 percent, providing further evidence of sustained
slowing in this measure. From a year earlier, the CPI was up 9.3
percent in December. More sensitive prices, such as industry selling
prices and home prices, have been weak for some'time, with year-over-
year increases in November of, respectively, 4-1/2 percent and minus
3-1/2 percent.
Solid signs of economic recovery remain limited to the residential
construction sector, with housing starts up markedly in both October and
November. By contrast, industrial production, after falling sharply in
October, rose only marginally in November to a level 19 percent below
its most recent peak, reached in June 1981.

IV -18
Announcement in early January of a record trade surplus for the
first 11 months of 1982 of $13 billion -- a rate more than twice that of
the previous two years -- contributed to upward pressure on the Canadian
dollar. Along with lower interest rates in the United States, this
allowed the Canadian authorities some leeway to reduce interest rates,
and the bank rate fell to below 10 percent for the first time in four
years.
French GDP fell 0.9 percent in the third quarter of 1982 but was
still nearly one percent above the level it reached in the third quarter
of 1981. The main source of strength was in the export sector which
revived from a poor performance in the first half of the year. This
reversal probably reflects an unwinding of previously delayed exports in
anticipation of the June devaluation of the franc. Also, imports were
down strongly. A decline in investment continued to weaken the French
economy. Although industrial production in October and November was
nearly 2-1/2 percent (s.a.) above the second quarter performance, it was
below the level attained in the fourth quarter of 1982. Recent surveys
indicate that stocks are approaching normal levels, but orders and
overall demand remain weak. General production prospects, judging from
survey results, appear improved.
After the June devaluation of the franc, the government instituted
a price freeze which is being slowly lifted by industry-government
negotiation. During the period of the freeze, mainly the third quarter,
consumer prices rose by only 5.6 percent (a.r.), a considerable
improvement over recent French experience. Although fourth-quarter
inflation accelerated to 7.6 percent when the controls were loosened,

IV -19
the French did manage to keep inflation to about 9-1/2 percent in 1982,
below their 10 percent target. The 1983 target remains 8 percent.
The current account showed a deficit of $12-1/2 billion in 1982,
though the rate of deficit declined in the third and fourth quarters
from the record second-quarter rate.
The 1983 budget seeks to limit the deficit to 3 percent of GNP.
Nevertheless, real expenditure will rise by over 4 percent while real
revenue will increase only marginally. This spending increase is less
than the 17 percent increase in 1982 and emphasizes investment and
subsidies in contrast to last year's emphasis on consumption.
M2 growth is targeted to be 10 percent in 1983, a considerable
reduction from the 12-1/2 to 13-1/2 percent range for 1982 which may be
slightly surpassed. Credit controls are to be tightened while housing
loans and exports will continue to be favored. Personal loans will be
frozen at the 1982 level.
In the United Kingdom indicators of economic activity continue to
be mixed, with the recovery that appears to have started at the end of
1981 still remaining very weak. Real GDP in the third quarter of 1982
was unchanged from its level in the second quarter, but was 1.1 percent
above its year-earlier level at the trough of the recent recession.
Retail sales (volume, s.a.) were exceptionally strong in December,
reaching the second highest level ever. The index in the fourth
quarter of 1982 was 4.5 percent above its year-earlier level. However,
industrial production fell in November, as it had in October, and in
those two months averaged 0.5 percent below its level for the comparable
period in 1981. Unemployment rose further in December to 12. percent 7
(s.a.) from 12.5 percent in November.

IV -20
Retail prices actually fell in December, producing an inflation
rate over the previous twelve months of 5.4 percent. Consumer price
inflation in the twelve months to December 1981 was 12 percent. The
December 1982 rate was the lowest U.K. inflation rate for a twelve
month interval in over a decade.
The U.K. current account was again in surplus in December. The
1982 total of $8 billion compares to a $12.9 billion surplus for 1981.
Italian economic activity remains depressed with little sign of
an upturn. Industrial production in November was over 4 percent below
its level of a year earlier. The official unemployment rate held
steady at 9.2 percent in the last two quarters of 1982. Inflation, as
measured by the consumer price index, abated somewhat last year, while
wholesale price inflation slowed significantly. Most of the difference
in the behavior of these two indices is explained by the sharp increases
in indirect taxes last year. Industrial wages rose by 16-1/2 percent in
the year ending in October, compared with a 24 percent rise in the year
ending in October 1981. On January 24, the government announced a wage
pact between the major labor unions and employer groups. The pact
includes a 15 percent reduction in the cost of living payments made under
the scala mobile.
The trade deficit in the first eleven months of last year was $11-
1/2 billion, over $4 billion lower than the deficit of the previous year.
Much of this improvement reflects the depreciation of the weighted
average lira by 12-1/2 percent in 1981. Last year, the lira declined
further by over 5 percent.

IV -24
In early January the Fanfani government proposed an austerity
package designed to keep the budget deficit at 70 trillion lire, or 15
percent of GNP. Passage of this budget is likely to be difficult. In a
separate move, the government proposed a one-year emergency loan of 8
trillion lire at a 5-1/2 percent rate of interest from the Bank of Italy
to the Treasury. The Treasury has been unable to sell enough securities
in recent months at current interest rates to finance its deficit.
Update on Major Debt Situations
The IMF Executive Board approved on December 23 a three-year $3.9
billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement for Mexico. One-third
of the amount is to be disbursed each year, subject to performance on the
agreed stabilization program. Since mid-December, the Mexican government
has introduced a dual exchange rate system, with flexibility in both
rates, eliminated most price controls, increased interest rates on bank
deposits, though they remain negative in real terms, and raised the mini-
mum wage by 25 percent, substantially less than the 100 percent rate of
inflation in 1982 or the prospective rate for 1983. The new minimum wage
is to apply only until mid-year. To gain acceptance of such moderate wage
increase, the authorities granted some tax concessions for the lower
income groups and postponed expected increases in the heavily subsidized
urban transport fares.
One of the two exchange rates, which applies mainly to trade and to
the servicing of the external public debt, was initially set at 95 pesos
per dollar, replacing the two fixed rates of 50 and 70 pesos per dollar
in effect since September 1. This rate is being depreciated daily at an
annual rate of 50 percent. The other exchange rate, which is nominally

IV -25
"free", was initially set at 148.5 (buying)-150.0 (selling) pesos per
dollar. This rate has been appreciated three times by small amounts.
Since January 24, it has been held at 147.9-149.4 pesos per dollar.
Efforts to raise $5 billion in loans from foreign banks are con-
tinuing, with about $4.7 billion committed to date. The plan to capita-
lize and convert to public sector debt private sector interest payments
due to foreign banks accruing between August 1, 1982, and January 31,
1983, has been put in motion. But preliminary indications are that only
about half of the estimated $1.3 billion in overdue interest potentially
eligible has qualified for the plan, as debtors had difficulty coming up
with the required peso deposits. Mexico has taken steps to promote the
restructuring of private sector external debts along lines that would
parallel the proposed restructuring of the public sector debt. The
request for a restructuring of the public sector external debt owed to
foreign banks remains pending.
On January 24 the IMF Executive Board approved a $1.65 billion
14-month standby arrangement for Argentina and a separate drawing of
about $555 million on the Compensatory Financing Facility for export
shortfalls (CFF). Under an agreement reached with the committee of
banks, international banks have begun making disbursements to Argentina
under a $1.1 billion bridging loan and are close to an agreement on $1.5
billion in new medium-term credits. Argentina and the bank committee
have also reached agreement in principle on refinancing or rescheduling
by June 30, 1983, $4.5-$5.5 billion in public and publicly-guaranteed
short and long-term debt coming due in 1983. On January 27, the BIS also

IV -26
announced the conclusion of a $500 million bridging loan to the central
bank backed by a number of BIS members and the U.S. monetary authorities.
Brazil received $550 million from the IMF under a CFF in December
1982. Negotiations on a $5 billion EFF program and on a request for $660
million from the CFF and buffer stock facilities are likely to result in
initial disbursements in February or March of 1983. Brazil in the fourth
quarter of 1982 obtained $2.3 billion in bridge loans with an average
maturity of 90 days from several commercial banks. The Brazilians have
advanced four proposals to meet their projected financial needs for 1983.
The key elements are a request for: $4.4 billion in new funding, roll-
over into long-term credits of $4 billion in amortization payments on
medium-term debt due in 1983, maintenance of $8.8 billion trade credits,
and restoration of money market lines to Brazilian banks to the level
outstanding on June 30, 1982. A recent $1.23 billion official short-term
borrowing from the United States has been disbursed and $780 million
repaid. In addition, a $1.45 billion loan was made available to Brazil
through the BIS, including $250 million from Saudi Arabia.
Chile's request for a $535 million 2-year standby arrangement was
approved by the IMF Executive Board on January 10, 1983. Also approved
was a separate drawing of about $315 million under the CFF. Chilean
authorities have also asked a group of private foreign commercial banks,
including both U.S. and non U.S. banks, for a 90 day suspension of repay-
ment on principal of medium- and long-term debt, continued rollover of
short-term debt, a rescheduling of as much as $3.8 billion in payments
falling due on public and private debt in 1983 and 1984 and $1 billion in
new medium-term credits. A large portion of the debt to be rescheduled

IV -27
is payable by private Chilean banks that are experiencing a severe liqui-
dity crisis. In mid-January, the Chilean authorities felt compelled to
take action with respect to 10 domestic banks, accounting for half the
assets of the Chilean banking system and about $4 billion in external
loans. Three of the affected banks were liquidated, five are under
temporary government management, and two are under continuous government
surveillance.
Venezuela has suffered a setback in its program, which began last
October, to refinance $8.8 billion in short-term government debt. In
January, one of the state agencies was late in making several payments on
debt which it holds or guarantees, leading to a legal action and the
withdrawal of several banks from participation in one of the refinancing
loans. Short-term debt of $3 billion had been scheduled for refinancing
in the first quarter of 1983, about half in January. The Finance Minister
has indicated that the central government will make the payments for the
agency. Recent weakness in the oil market increases Venezuela's diffi-
culties in refinancing the short-term debt. The Finance Minister has
indicated that IMF assistance might be sought if the refinancing effort
falls short; he plans to visit New York banks to discuss the refinancing
problems and arrange for a team of advisors from major banks.
