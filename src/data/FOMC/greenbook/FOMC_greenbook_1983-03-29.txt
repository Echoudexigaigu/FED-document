 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The long-awaited recovery in economic activity appears to be
clearly under way. Both employment and production increased during
the first two months of the year. In addition, housing starts con-
tinued to rise rapidly, and consumer spending advanced further. News
about inflation remains favorable, partly reflecting the downward price
adjustment in energy markets.
Industrial Production
Industrial production increased 0.3 percent in February after a
rise of 1.3 percent in January. As a result, industrial output in
February was 1-3/4 percent above its trough in November 1982, although
it was still about 11 percent below the peak in July 1981. So far, the
recovery has been quite moderate. Since November, production has risen
at an annual rate of 7-1/4 percent, well below the average rate of
increase for the first three months following a cyclical trough.
Production of consumer goods increased 0.5 percent in February
with automotive output rising for the third consecutive month. Autos
were assembled at an annual rate of 6.3 million units, up considerably
from the 4.5 million unit November rate; however, current industry
schedules indicate a reduction in assemblies for March. Output of home
goods fell back a bit in February, but was still more than 3 percent
above its December low. Production of defense and space equipment
continued to rise in February, and output of construction supplies
advanced moderately after a large gain in January. In contrast, produc-
tion of business equipment declined again in February, reflecting a
sharp contraction in oil and gas well drilling.

Labor Market
Rising output in the industrial sector over the December-
February period has been mirrored in recent labor market developments.
After bottoming out in December, payroll employment showed a net gain
of 150,000 over the first two months of the year. Factory employment
rose in both January and February as increased activity in the auto
and housing sectors led to rehires in transportation equipment, metals,
lumber, and other related industries. So far, employment gains have
been entirely among production workers while supervisors continue to
be laid off, suggesting that firms are still scaling back white-collar
overhead. Employment in retail trade improved over the first two
months of the year after declining during 1982; hiring in other service-
producing industries continued at about last year's slow pace.
The civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 10.4 percent
in February. As usual after a cyclical trough, all of the reduction
in unemployment since December has been for the short-duration jobless.
The number of workers unemployed longer than six months continued near
its cyclical high. The labor force participation rate remained fairly
low in February after a sharp drop a month earlier. This decline was
unusual because it occurred almost entirely among adult men.
Personal Income and Consumption
Income generated by the private sector began to step up early
this year. Despite a weather-induced decline in February, payrolls
were still $14 billion above the December level. However, total person-
al income was up considerably less as a number of temporary factors
reduced the non-labor components: farm subsidy payments dropped back,

unemployment insurance transfers declined, and the social security
taxable wage base was raised. Given these developments, real dis-
posable income appears to have been about unchanged since the fourth
quarter. Nonetheless, the February level of real outlays for per-
sonal consumption is estimated to have been about 3/4 percent above
the fourth-quarter average, and the personal saving rate fell to 5.6
percent from 6 percent in the fourth quarter.
Sales of domestic automobiles have averaged about 6 million units
a year since December. These sales, boosted by extended interest-rate
concessions, have remained about 7 percent above their level in the
first three quarters of 1982, but are still low by historical stan-
dards. Purchases of foreign cars also have been higher in recent
months than last year. The small decline in February to a 2.4 million
unit annual rate was probably the result of limited supplies of Japanese
models; these reduced stocks, which can be attributed to export restric-
tions and unusually strong sales in previous months, are likely to
further constrain sales in near term.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, and noncon-
sumption items, continued to improve in January and February. Re-
vised data now show increases of 0.5 percent in nominal terms in
each month. In February sales at the general merchandise, apparel,
and furniture and appliance (GAF) group of stores, often considered
an indicator of discretionary spending, stood 2.6 percent above
fourth quarter level. Consumer surveys point toward further improve-
ment in consumer demand; both the Conference Board and the Michigan

Survey Research Center indexes of consumer sentiment rose in Feb-
ruary to their highest levels since 1981.
Housing Markets
Housing markets strengthened markedly in early 1983. Total
private housing starts averaged a 1.7 million unit annual rate during
the first two months of the year, up nearly 40 percent from the pace
in the fourth quarter. Newly-issued building permits also rose.
Within the single-family market, starts in both January and Feb-
ruary were above a million units for the first time since 1979.
Through January the recent rise in starts was in excess of the re-
covery in sales and may have reflected in part an attempt by build-
ers to increase depleted inventories in anticipation of a strong
spring sales season. In particular, starts of single-family units
in the first two months of the year were 35 percent above their
fourth quarter average; in comparison, in January, new and existing
home sales were up 12 and 22 percent respectively.
Multifamily housing starts also surged during the first two
months of 1983, with the February rate, 716,000 units, the highest pace
in almost a decade. This increase came despite the fact that vacancy
rates for units in multifamily structures backed up steadily late last
year from the extremely low levels of 1981.
Business Fixed Investment
Outlays for business fixed investment have continued to decline.
In the equipment sector, shipments of nondefense capital goods edged
down in February to a level about two percent below their fourth
quarter average after dropping about 3 percent per quarter during the

last half of 1982. New orders for nondefense capital goods fell
sharply in February, but most of the decline was in the aircraft
industry, where bookings vary widely from month to month.
New construction put-in-place, which comprises about three-
fourths of total expenditures for nonresidential structures, rose 6
percent in January, following a 1.2 percent decline in December. Much
of the rise in outlays in January may have been due to the unseasonably
warm weather that month. Although there were increases in most major
categories of building construction, one notable exception was office
building for which spending has leveled off. This is consistent with
a continued rise in national office vacancy rates (which were above 10
percent in December according to a survey by Coldwell Banker) and
reports that prices of office buildings have fallen. Outlays for
petroleum drilling and mining, the other major component of nonresi-
dential structures, continue to be weak. The index of rotary rigs in
operation declined 14 percent in February, after firming in the previous
few months.
Recent surveys of 1983 capital spending plans have shown little
change from those taken at the end of last year. According to the
February McGraw-Hill survey, businesses plan to reduce outlays by
2.9 percent in 1983, compared with the 2.1 percent decline expected in
November. The February Commerce Department survey, which showed a
similar downward revision, indicates an anticipated 1.7 percent decline
in 1983 spending, with a reduction in expenditures in the first half
of the year combined with an increase in the second half. The Con-
ference Board Survey of net capital appropriations for the nation's

1,000 largest manufacturers also suggests some strengthening in the
future. In the fourth quarter of last year, manufacturers increased
appropriations by 27 percent from the depressed third quarter level.
Because the lag between appropriations and outlays is two to four
quarters, this may signal some upturn in investment in the second half
of 1983.
Inventory Investment
Businesses continued to liquidate inventories at a rapid
pace in January. Total manufacturing and trade inventories, in con-
stant dollars, fell at a $23 billion annual rate, compared with a
decline of $20 billion in the fourth quarter. The January inventory
contraction was accompanied by a 2.4 percent rise in total real ship-
ments and sales. As a result, the ratio of inventories to sales fell
appreciably. Although the recent liquidation has brought the stock-
sales ratio from its cyclical peak, it still is above its pre-
recession average.
The January decline in inventories was concentrated in the
manufacturing sector. All major durable goods industries reduced their
inventories, with large reductions reported for the primary metals and
nonelectrical machinery industries, where imbalances have been persis-
tent. In the trade sector, domestic auto stocks at dealers rose a
little in February, but still represented a relatively comfortable 61
days' supply.
Federal Government
The federal government budget deficit on a unified basis is
tentatively estimated to be about $60 billion (not an annual rate) in
the first quarter, around $36 billion more than the deficit recorded a

II-16
year earlier. The widening in the deficit largely reflects the lower
level of economic activity and the continuing effects of tax law changes
made in 1981 and 1982; in addition, more than $10 billion was due to a
shift in the timing of social security benefits payments.
On the expenditure side, quarterly outlays for unemployment com-
pensation are estimated to be about $4 billion higher than a year
earlier. In addition, defense outlays appear to be running around $6
billion, or 13 percent, above their year-earlier levels. Revenues are
estimated to be about 5 percent lower than a year earlier. However,
expectations that there will be considerably higher than usual growth
in personal tax refunds this year have not been confirmed by the data
available through mid-March.
Federal budget deficits in FY 1983 and FY 1984 could be affec-
ted by two bills expected to be signed into law soon. A "jobs bill"
that, among other things, accelerates spending for a number of federal
projects, could increase outlays by $4-1/2 billion over the next three
years. The social security bill incorporates most of the recommenda-
tions of the National Commission on Social Security Reform. These
include a postponement of the July 1983 COLA for retirement and dis-
ability benefits to January 1, 1984, an acceleration of payroll tax
increases to 1984, the taxation of social security benefits for higher
income recipients, and the extention of social security coverage to
newly employed federal workers beginning in 1984. These reforms would
reduce the unified budget deficit by about $1-1/2 billion in fiscal
year 1983 and by $9-1/2 billion in fiscal year 1984. In addition, the

II-17
social security bill would extend the supplemental unemployment bene-
fits program another six months to September 30.
State and Local Government
State and local government spending appears to have risen a
little in recent months. Employment fell slightly in the first two
months of this year, continuing its two year decline. In contrast,
state and local government construction expenditures (which comprise
10 percent of total state and local purchases) jumped a surprising 17
percent in January. Although some of this increase is attributable to
January's mild weather, the rise also may signal the beginning of an
upward trend in state and local construction, which could be sup-
ported in part by the large amount of new debt issued in the closing
months of 1982 as well as the prospect of increased federal highway
grants.
Many state governments project sizable deficits for the current
fiscal year and beyond. Because most states are not allowed to run
a deficit in their general funds, legislative actions to reduce expendi-
tures and/or raise revenues are required. However, a majority of
states already have taken measures to reduce expenditures in fiscal
year 1983, and current proposals center on raising revenues. Eight
states have raised sales and income taxes, and California has adopted a
standby sales tax increase. In addition, Michigan and Illinois are
considering large tax increases to cover substantial projected deficits.
Wages and Labor Costs
Increases in wage rates have continued to slow for most
workers. Over the three months ended in February, the hourly earnings

index--a measure of wage rate changes for production and nonsupervisory
workers--rose at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate. This increase represents
a slight moderation from the fourth-quarter pace and is well below the
6-1/4 percent rate over the first three quarters of last year.
Recent union settlements generally have continued to result in
smaller wage increases than last year, with some key union contracts
calling for pay cuts or freezes. The master steel agreement, which
went into effect March 1 at eight major steel producers, reduced wage
rates about 9 percent and limited cost-of-living payments. The wage
cut will be restored during the next three years; assuming a 4 percent
inflation rate, the average hourly wage, including COLAs, is expected
to be only about 3 percent higher at the end of the contract period in
1986 than prior to the settlement. Typically, the master steel contract
has set the pattern for other steel contracts and also has influenced
the outcomes of talks in the aluminum, copper, and metal container
industries. The median first-year settlement has been running 5-1/2
percent (excluding COLA) so far this year, compared with 7 percent
last year, according to a private survey of contracts involving 50 or
more workers.
Revised data on nonfarm productivity and costs showed a
somewhat smaller increase in output per hour at the end of 1982 than
was initially reported. Even so, productivity was up 1.7 percent over
the four quarters of last year despite the decline in output, and unit
labor costs rose 4.7 percent, down from nearly 9 percent in 1981. The
rise in hourly compensation for the fourth quarter was revised down to
a 5.6 percent annual rate.

II-20
Prices [February CPI data due Wednesday morning.]
Inflation reports show low or negative rates so far this year,
largely reflecting sharp declines in energy prices. The consumer price
index for all urban consumers (CPI-U), which is now based on a rental
equivalence measure of homeowners' costs, rose only 0.2 percent in
January and fell 0.2 percent in February. Over the same months, the
CPI for wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) edged down; this
index, which is still used in calculating most cost-of-living adjust-
ments, retains the old homeownership measure. At the producer level,
the index of finished goods prices fell nearly 1 percent between
December and February.
Prices of petroleum products have been falling rapidly at
all levels. For example, the price of retail gasoline tumbled 9-3/4
percent from December to February. The recent OPEC agreement is expected
to bring stability to the international crude oil market, and should
result in a firming of refined product prices in coming months. In
addition, the April 1 increase of 5 cents per gallon in the federal
excise tax is likely to put upward pressure on gasoline prices.
Movements in food prices also have continued to exert a
moderating influence on inflation. At the consumer level, food prices
have remained about constant since mid-1982. However, producer prices
of finished foods turned up in February and crude food prices have
been rising since late last October--although, in the case of grains,
from very low levels--suggesting a firming in retail prices in coming
months. The recent severe weather in California appears to have delayed

planting of vegetable crops; such disruptions often have been associated
with temporary price hikes several months later.
Outside the food and energy sectors, consumer prices rose at
about a 5-1/4 percent annual rate over the first two months of this year,
a bit better than in 1982. The commodities component was boosted in
January by a hike in cigarette prices associated with the higher
federal excise tax. In contrast, the rise in service costs has slowed
significantly.
At the producer level, capital equipment prices posted a net
increase of less than 1/2 percent so far this year. There has been,
however, a significant rise since late last year in the prices of some
industrial commodities, notably scrap metals. Prices of these materials--
which account for a very small share of total final product costs--have
been extremely depressed as a result of inventory overhangs and slack
demand. The price index for intermediate materials (nonfood, nonenergy)--
items which have a much larger share of "value added"--turned up in
February, reflecting large increases in prices of steel mill products,
nonferrous metals, and lumber. However, prices of many other intermediate
materials declined, and the index level remained only a little higher
than a year earlier.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1 and M2 grew at extraordinarily rapid rates in February, and early
indications for March suggest continued strong expansion, albeit not at the
pace of the prior month. The February surge in M1 marked the seventh con-
secutive month of double-digit (or near double-digit) growth, and this
aggregate apparently was affected only minimally, if at all, by shifting
associated with the new deposit instruments. Inflows to MMDAs continued
to bolster M2 growth in February, though the pace of inflows to this new
account has slowed week by week. M3 growth in recent months has been well
below that of the narrower monetary aggregates, primarily reflecting run-
offs of large CDs.
Short-term interest rates have increased 10 to 30 basis points, on
balance, since the last FOMC meeting, while longer-term rates have declined
40 to 50 basis points. Interest rates across the maturity spectrum declined
in the last half of February as financial market participants reacted favor-
ably to the System's Humphrey-Hawkins report and the prospect of lower oil
prices. In March, however, short-term interest rates more than retraced
their declines, reflecting in part an uneasiness about the uptrend in the
monetary aggregates and its implications for System policy. Most major
commercial banks reduced their prime rate at the end of February from 11
to 10-1/2 percent, the lowest level since October 1978. Mortgage rates
also are lower than at the time of the last FOMC meeting.
In the first quarter, the U.S. Treasury has continued to be a mas-
sive borrower, tapping both the short-term and long-term markets in large
volume. The pace of borrowing by state and local governments has slowed
considerably from its fourth-quarter record, despite a growing volume of

advance refunding issues prompted by the lower interest rates now prevail-
ing. Nonfinancial businesses have continued to raise only a moderate
volume of new funds in the current quarter, and while the replacement
of short-term debt with long-term debt has slowed, firms have been achiev-
ing significant balance sheet improvements by stepping up offerings of
equity shares. Data on household borrowing thus far in 1983 are scanty,
but the strong January growth of installment credit and upward movement in
housing activity and mortgage commitments suggest that overall credit use
by this sector has been on the increase.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 grew at a 21-1/4 percent annual rate in February, well above the
already rapid rate experienced over the preceding six months. The accele-
ration was accounted for by a surge in other checkable deposits (on a sea-
sonally adjusted basis) while currency growth continued at the elevated
January pace. The adjustments by the public to the new deposit instruments
appear to have had little, if any, effect on the February strength in M1
balances. Data for early March suggest another sizable monthly increase in
M1, even though increases in super NOWs appear to have diminished consider-
ably.
The downward trend in M1 velocity that began in 1981 evidently has
continued in the first quarter, with shifts to super NOW accounts from
sources outside M1 playing a modest role at most. The decrease in velocity
is greater than experienced on average at comparable stages of earlier busi-
ness cycles and is much weaker than predicted by the Board's econometric
models.

Growth of M2 in February, at a 23-3/4 percent annual rate, was off
only moderately from the record pace of January. Data for early March,
however, imply a somewhat greater deceleration this month. Money market
deposit accounts continued to grow rapidly in February and early March,
but at a steadily slower rate. The bulk of inflows to MMDAs continues to
represent transfers from savings and small-denomination time deposits and
shares in general purpose and broker/dealer money market mutual funds. The
reduced growth of MMDAs during February and March likely reflects a natural
waning in the adjustment of the public to this new deposit instrument, as
well as the further narrowing in spreads between the offering rates on MMDAs
and the rates on other instruments; currently, offering rates on MMDAs in
most cases have dropped to near those on short-term market instruments.1
M3 grew at a 13 percent annual rate in February, a bit above its Jan-
uary pace. Large CDs and shares of institution-only money market mutual
funds continued to decline rapidly in February, although at a somewhat
slower rate than in the previous month. The runoff of large CDs is largely
attributable to MMDAs, as some investors have shifted directly to the new
account and as commercial banks have cut issuance in response to stronger
core deposits. To some extent, shares of institution-only money market
funds also may have shifted directly to MMDAs, but a portion likely was
placed in open market instruments which generally were paying higher returns
than those registered by money funds. M3 growth appears to have slowed con-
siderably in March, reflecting the deceleration of M2.
1. During February, the average offering rate on MMDAs declined about a
percentage point at mutual savings banks and 3/4 of a percentage point at
commercial banks while short-term open market rates were little changed.
The MSB average offering rate was about 3/4 of a percentage point above
the commercial bank rate.

After two months of brisk expansion, bank credit slowed to a 7 per-
cent annual rate of growth in February. Acquisitions of U.S. government
securities, although substantial, diminished relative to January and
holdings of other securities declined slightly. Growth in total loans
picked up only a little from the slow January pace, with essentially no
expansion in business loans. Based on the February survey of bank lending
practices, a large proportion of senior bank loan officers expect the
demand for business loans to weaken over the next three months.1 Consumer
loans at commercial banks also were about unchanged in February despite
survey evidence that indicated a greater willingness of large commercial
banks to make such loans. In early March, business loan growth at large
banks flattened out and consumer and real estate lending was sluggish; in
contrast, Treasury security acquisitions, largely in trading accounts,
strengthened from February's pace.
Business Finance
Nonfinancial corporations are continuing to restructure their bal-
ance sheets by emphasizing longer-term financing. In recent months, pro-
gress on this front has been slowed somewhat by reduced bond offerings
and a small increase in short-term credit. Outstanding commercial paper
rose in February, the first increase for nonfinancial corporations in six
months, and business loans at commercial banks increased moderately in
January and February combined.
Considering the size of the decline in bond rates since last summer,
and the extraordinarily high ratio of short-term to total debt, the moder-
ate bond volume might be viewed as surprising. On the other hand, "real"

rates may appear unattractively high to some potential bond issuers, and
many firms have been able to achieve improvements in both debt structure
and debt-equity ratios by selling new equity shares. Price-earnings ratios
generally are at their highest level since 1977, and most major stock price
indexes have recorded new highs during the intermeeting period.1 Over the
past seven months, the broader stock price indexes have advanced 45 to 65
percent, one of the strongest gains on record.
Financial companies have been active issuers of both bonds and stocks
in early 1983. A large portion of the equity issues of these firms has
been in the form of adjustable-rate preferred stock. The yields on these
securities are established quarterly at some fixed spread from Treasury
yields, and for corporate purchasers, 85 percent of the dividend income is
exempt from income tax. Thus, they represent an attractive alternative to
taxable short-term instruments for use by corporations as a money manage-
ment tool--assuming their secondary market liquidity proves adequate.
Since the beginning of the year, adjustable-rate preferred stock issues
have accounted for about 20 percent of the total equity volume.
Government Finance
Federal Sector. Marketable borrowing by the Treasury totaled about
$55 billion in the first quarter, with roughly half of the total issuance
occurring in March. With the increase in the regular auctions of 3- and
6-month bills to $12.4 billion in mid-February, the Treasury is raising
about $1 billion net in the bill sector each week. In addition, the issu-
ance of a cash management bill dated to mature in April swelled borrowing

45 to 65 percent below the peaks that were reached throughout the period
from the mid-1960s through the early 1970s.

through Treasury bills. Borrowing is also continuing heavy in the coupon
sector: the Treasury raised $10-1/2 billion in new cash in late March
with the auctions of 4-year and 7-year notes and 20-year bonds--the so-
called mini-refunding. Nonmarketable debt outstanding is expected to
decline by $1-1/2 billion in the first quarter after a $3 billion increase
in the fourth quarter. A renewed runoff of foreign nonmarketable debt
mainly accounted for the turnaround.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies continued light
through February owing to declining lending activity by the Federal Home
Loan Banks and the Farm Credit Banks. At least part of the weakness in
lending by the Farm Credit Banks represented a substitution of CCC loans
to farmers. FNMA ran off a small amount of debt in February, after bor-
rowing more than $2 billion in January. However, this monthly pattern
reflects the timing of its debt issuance rather than weakness in mortgage
acquisitions; FNMA's net mortgage purchases are estimated to have been
about $1 billion in February, close to the pace of recent months.
State and local sector. Rates on municipal securities fell along
with other market rates during February, bringing tax-exempt yields to
their lowest levels in 2-1/2 years. The reduced level of rates has encour-
aged continued substantial issuance of long-term bonds, though less than
occurred in the fourth quarter when special legal factors were at work.
Nearly 20 percent of the long-term bonds sold in February and early March
were advance refunding issues that eventually will replace older, higher-
yielding debt. Until the call date on the older bonds, the proceeds from
the advance refunding issues are placed in escrow and invested in taxable
securities, usually nonmarketable Treasuries.

1. These numbers do not include tax-exempt commercial paper.
Housing revenue bonds accounted for about 15 percent of total long-
term offerings in February and in March. The sizable volume of such secu-
rities reflected in part the downward movement in tax-exempt bond rates
relative to yields on conventional mortgages. In addition, many issuers
may have been drawn into the market earlier than otherwise because of leg-
islation introduced in Congress that would prohibit, after April 14, the
sale of mortgage revenue bonds backed by the deposit insurance of the FSLIC
or FDIC.1 Federally insured housing bonds were introduced in October 1982
1. Under these arrangements, a local housing authority sells tax-exempt
mortgage revenue bonds to investors and uses the proceeds of this sale
to purchase a certificate of deposit from a savings and loan association
or commercial bank. The depository institution then uses the funds from
this CD issuance to grant lower-rate mortgages generally for multifamily
units. Because the CD is held by a trustee as security for the benefit
of bondholders, and because a listing of the individual purchasers of
the mortgage revenue bond is maintained, federal deposit insurance flows
through to the bondholders.

III-13
and there are about $800 million outstanding; reports indicate that the
outstanding volume could surge to $2 billion before April 15.
Individuals reportedly remain the principal purchasers of tax-exempt
securities, both directly and indirectly through bond funds and unit invest-
ment trusts. Total assets of open-end municipal bond funds increased a
record $850 million in February, bringing the level to $9.3 billion, and
total assets of unit investment trusts grew another $1.4 billion to $42
billion.
Mortgage Market
Since the last FOMC meeting, average interest rates on new commit-
ments for conventional, fixed-rate home mortgages at S&Ls have declined
about 25 basis points to 12.81 percent in late March; for the first time
since August 1980, the average commitment rate has been below 13 percent
in all major regions of the nation. Yields in the secondary mortgage mar-
ket generally have tracked other market rates, declining in the latter
half of February but increasing somewhat in the early part of March. The
recent rise in yields on GNMA-guaranteed securities eased pressure for a
reduction of the 12 percent ceiling rate on regular FHA/VA home loans--a
ceiling that has been in effect since mid-November.
The volume of new mortgage commitments made by savings and loan asso-
ciations in January amounted to $9.2 billion (seasonally adjusted), about
equal to the December volume and nearly double the pace recorded during
the first half of last year. The higher level of commitment activity at
S&Ls in the last few months is beginning to be reflected in mortgage invest-
ment. Total mortgage assets of S&Ls (including loans and mortgage-backed
securities) grew by $1.8 billion in January after a slight decline in

III-14
December. The January gain included the first increase in mortgage loans
since early 1982 as well as a sharp fall-off in acquisitions of mortgage-
backed securities--a pattern that reflects a reduction in swap activity
in light of strong MMDA inflows.1 At mutual savings banks, mortgage loans
increased $300 million in December (the latest available data), the first
increase in 17 months and the largest since August 1979.
As interest rates have fallen in primary mortgage markets, an increas-
ing share of mortgage originations has been for fixed-rate rather than
adjustable-rate loans. Unpublished data from the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board show that fixed-rate mortgages accounted for 72 percent of the total
number of conventional home loans closed in February by institutional lend-
ers, up from 54 percent last August. In addition, nearly two-fifths of
respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey noted a shift in
demand at their commercial banks toward fixed-rate mortgages; roughly
three-fourths of the commitments issued by respondents in January were for
fixed-rate loans (see appendix).
The decline in mortgage rates also has stimulated the refinancing of
high-rate loans written during 1981 and 1982. In the period from November
through January, mortgage loans made by S&Ls for purposes of refinancing
have been about double the volume evident in the first half of last year.
Also, the mid-February survey of senior loan officers indicated that the
refinancing of existing mortgages accounted for about one-fourth of total
1. At FNMA and FHLMC combined, issues of securities under swap programs
declined from $5.9 billion in December to $1.8 billion in January. With
strong growth in core deposits, thrift institutions can reduce their bor-
rowing through repurchase agreements, and thus have a reduced need for
mortgage-backed securities which could serve as collateral in these
transactions.

home mortgage lending at their banks in January. Most of this refinancing
activity related to high-rate first mortgages held by these lenders, rather
than to loans made and held by individuals who had sold their homes.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit expanded at a 10-1/2 percent annual rate
in January, marking the third consecutive month of accelerating growth and
the largest increase since September 1981. In contrast to other recent
months when auto credit was the strongest component, the January increase
stemmed primarily from a large gain in the category that includes personal
cash loans, home improvement credit, and sales finance contracts on non-
automotive consumer goods.
Interest rates on consumer loans in the initial weeks of 1983 con-
tinued a decline that began in the fourth quarter of last year. At com-
mercial banks, rates on new-car loans dropped about 2-1/4 percentage points
between early August and early February to an average of 14.8 percent. At
the "captive" finance companies, rates paid by consumers on new-car loans
have plunged more than 5 percentage points to the lowest levels since 1973.
This reduction was prompted by the rate subsidy programs of the car-manu-
facturing parent companies.
Rates on personal loans at banks have fallen less than those on auto
loans--about 1-1/2 percentage points between August and February-and are
viewed as high relative to other market rates by some observers. The com-
paratively sluggish decline in personal loan rates reflects in part less
intense competition than is currently affecting auto loan markets, and
perhaps continuing concern among lenders about the increased risk of unse-
cured lending that has resulted from the more lenient federal bankruptcy

law enacted in late 1979. From a more general perspective, it should be
noted that consumer loan rates generally lag other market rates and fluc-
tuate less during the course of the business cycle. Thus, the behavior of
consumer loan rates in recent months is not sharply out of line with pre-
vious experience.

Appendix A*
SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES
Of the sixty large commercial banks participating in the
February 15, 1983 Survey of Senior Loan Officer Opinion on Bank
Lending Practices, two-fifths anticipated that the demand for
business loans would ease over the next three months, roughly
double the proportion expecting loan demand to strengthen.
Larger respondents tended to be more pessimistic than smaller
institutions. Growth of business loans at large commercial
banks had been relatively sluggish since the previous survey in
mid-November, and the weak economy together with continued
strength in long-term financing may have contributed to this
view.
Lagging earlier declines in open market rates, the prime
rate has continued to move downward in recent months. At the time
of the February survey, the prime rate was roughly 275 basis points
above the one-month commercial paper rate, down from about 315 basis
points in mid-November. As in the previous survey, however, other
aspects of lending terms were largely unaltered. Four-fifths of the
panel indicated no change over the past three months in standards of
creditworthiness to qualify for their lowest lending rates, and
almost as many banks reported no change in standards to qualify for
given spreads above their lowest lending rate. Similarly, about
three-fourths of the respondents indicated that compensating balance
or fee requirements on business loans had not changed since mid-
November, roughly the same proportion of banks that reported no change
in policy toward business lending to new and non-local customers.
For the second consecutive survey, more than two-fifths of the
sampled banks expressed greater willingness to make installment loans
to individuals compared to three months earlier. Factors cited by
banks for this increased willingness included favorable rate spreads
on consumer loans and strong inflows of core deposits in the face of
weak demands for business loans.
Answers to the first supplemental question, dealing with credit
quality, indicate still further erosion in the credit quality of
existing business loan customers at the surveyed banks. Sixty per-
cent of the respondents perceived a deterioration over the past three
months in the average financial condition of customers with business
loans outstanding, while only one bank reported an improvement. The
proportion of larger respondents (those with more than $5 billion of
total domestic assets) noting a deterioration in the financial condi-
tion of existing customers, 80 percent, was nearly twice the fraction
of smaller banks so reporting.

Research and Statistics.

III-A-2
The energy and manufacturing industries were the most fre-
quently cited business sectors where deterioration has occurred,
followed by transportation, capital equipment, and agribusiness.
About one-tenth of the respondents noted financial deterioration
across the board.
Despite widespread problems with nonperforming loans at
commercial banks over the past year or so, less than one-quarter
of the respondents reported that the incidence of problem loans at
their banks had affected lending terms offered to new or old busi-
ness customers. Of these institutions, most responded to the inci-
dence of problem loans by increasing collateral requirements or by
making loans with shorter maturities. Several banks commented that,
although wider spreads between interest rates on loans and banks'
costs of funds probably were justified in the present environment,
intense competition among banks for loans was in fact driving spreads
lower.
A second set of supplemental questions examined the extent to
which the recently authorized money market deposit account (MMDA) has
affected bank lending practices. Eighty-five percent of the sampled
banks reported experiencing large net inflows of funds into MMDAs
since December, but only 35 percent of these institutions indicated
that MMDA inflows, or associated costs, had affected their lending
practices regarding business loans. Less than 15 percent of the
respondents that registered large net inflows into MMDAs were
induced to become more aggressive in seeking out new business loan
customers, and less than 25 percent altered their lending terms on
business loans as a result of MMDAs. Changes in lending terms on
business loans involved mainly reduced willingness to make fixed-
rate, long-term loans, and greater use of pricing formulae based on
banks' costs of funds--including increased willingness to offer lower
tier customers floating-rate loans priced off open-market rates.
Roughly the same proportion of respondents--approximately 15
percent--indicated that these inflows had increased their bank's
willingness to make consumer installment or mortgage loans. Several
respondents noted that, partly as a result of MMDAs, they had recently
introduced, or were developing plans for introducing, adjustable-rate
consumer installment loans. One large money center bank noted that,
due to sizable MMDA inflows, it may soon begin holding home mortgages
in its portfolio, rather than reselling the mortgages in the secondary
market.
In response to a final set of supplemental questions dealing
with recent home mortgage lending activity, more than two-fifths of
the respondents noted that the composition of demand for home mortgage
credit during the past three months had shifted toward fixed-rate

III-A-3
loans as home mortgage rates continued to drop. On average, respon-
dents indicated that three-fourths of their total new commitments for
home mortgages in January were for fixed-rate loans. Over this same
period, panel members reported on average that onefourth of total
mortgage lending was for the purpose of refinancing existing mortgages,
but that less than one-tenth of total home mortgage refinancings were
to refinance mortgages held by the previous sellers of the homes.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown by the chart on the top of the next page, the dollar
has appreciated slightly from its level at the time of the February FOMC
meeting. After reaching a peak in the beginning of February the dollar
fell almost three percent to a trough in mid-February. The fall was
apparently due to renewed expectations of declines in dollar interest
rates. From mid-February until the beginning of March the dollar rose
over two percent. Market commentary suggested that the dollar's rise was
associated with increased concern about the international debt situation
related to the prospect of sharp downward movements in oil prices. Since
the beginning of March the dollar has remained steady, supported by
higher actual and expected dollar interest rates and the lowering of some
foreign interest rates.
Since the last FOMC meeting the pound depreciated almost three
percent to a record low against the dollar. On February 17 the British
National Oil Corporation announced a price reduction. This was followed
closely by price cuts by Norway and Nigeria and a two percent depre-
ciation of the pound. The pound continued to be weak throughout the
latter half of February and early March as OPEC attempted to reach an
accord on prices and quotas. After OPEC reached an agreement on
March 14, the pound continued to weaken due to expectations that the
British National Oil Corporation will again cut prices which will further
reduce U.K. oil revenues.
Expectations of declines in oil prices also played a role in the
gold market. Beliefs that lower oil prices would lead to mid-East gold

sales were a major factor in causing gold prices to fall by over fifteen
percent to below $410 in New York since the last FOMC meeting.
The EMS continued to be under strong pressure since the last FOMC
meeting and on March 21 the EC ministers realigned the EMS central parity
rates, as shown in the lower panel of the chart. The central rate of the
mark relative to the European Currency Unit was revalued 5.5 percent, the
guilder was revalued 3.5 percent, the krone was revalued 2.5 percent, the
Belgian franc was revalued 1.5 percent, the French franc and lira were
each devalued 2.5 percent, and the Irish pound was devalued 3.5 percent.
After the March 6 elections in West Germany and France the pressure in
the EMS became more acute.
.Belgium raised official lending rates 2-1/2 percentage points
and imposed restrictions on domestic holding of foreign currency.
Germany lowered its official interest rates one percentage point and the
Netherlands lowered its rates 1/2 percentage point. Switzerland and
Austria, outside the EMS, also followed Germany's lead, reducing their
official lending rates by 1/2 and 1 percentage point, respectively.
Since the EMS realignment the French franc has traded at near its
new upper intervention limit against the mark,
.Belgium has lowered its official
lending rates by three percentage points.

U.S. banks' claims on foreign borrowers. Foreign lending by
U.S.-chartered banks slowed further in the second half of 1982, when the
increase in outstanding claims declined to $3 billion from $18 billion in
the first half. Net new lending --the change in outstanding claims --to
OPEC and non-OPEC developing countries and to the smaller developed
countries in the second half of last year was only one-fourth to one-half
as much as in the first half, while there was an actual decline in the
outstanding claims on the G-10 countries and offshore banking centers
(which are largely interbank) in the second half. For 1982 as a whole,
total net new lending of $20 billion was less than one-third of the 1981
total.
Several factors appear to have contributed to the slowing of lending
last year. First, banks became more concerned about return on assets, and
this induced them to slow the growth of their interbank lending. Second,
some banks became more cautious about lending in the interbank market, in
view of such factors as the high exposure of German banks to Eastern Europe
and AEG-Telefunken, the exposure of Canadian banks to Dome Petroleum, and
the Banco Ambrosiano affair. Third, some banks became more anxious to
improve their capital/assets ratios or prevent them from declining further.
Fourth, output declined and inflation weakened in the main industrial
countries abroad, and this may have slowed those countries' demands for
credit from U.S. banks. Finally, banks became more cautious about lending
to the non-OPEC developing countries, especially after the eruption of the

Recent changes in lending to the non-OPEC developing countries show
a considerable distinction between flows to Latin America and those to Asia

The situation has been different for the non-OPEC developing
countries in Asia and Africa. Claims on these countries rose $2.6 billion
in the second half of 1982, all in the fourth quarter; this was more than
in the first half and two-thirds as much as in the second half of 1981.
Conditions in the syndicated credit market also show that the climate for
Asian borrowers has changed much less radically than for Latin America.
Since last August that market has virtually dried up for Latin America while
Asian borrowers can still raise a large volume of loans, albeit at somewhat
higher spreads than before or through loans priced over the prime rate rather
than the LIBOR rate.
U.S. banks' claims on Latin America are expected to rise again as a
result of the new medium-term loans forming part of the recent financial
"packages" for some major Latin American borrowers. Since the end of 1982,
term loans have been negotiated with Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico totalling
$12 billion, of which the U.S. banks' share appears to be about 40 percent,
or $4-3/4 billion. Whether the U.S. banks' claims on these countries will
rise by that much this year will depend in part on whether the disbursements
of these loans, which will be piecemeal and dependent on these countries'
eligibility for further drawings on the IMF, will take place as scheduled.
The level of claims on these countries will also be affected by such factors
as scheduled amortizations of private medium-term debts that may not be
rescheduled and by these countries' need for and ability to retain short-
term credit. One large group of short-term credits that are expected to be
repaid this year are the bridge credits which Brazil obtained late last year.
However, these repayments could be partly offset as banks accede to the new
loan requests made recently by Chile and Peru, which total more than $1.7
billion.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
U.S. official reserve assets continued to rise in early 1983
even in the absence of foreign exchange market intervention by the
United States. (See the table below.) These increases were the
result of bilateral bridging finance and transactions with the
IMF, stemming from various IMF stabilization programs. Given the
large IMF programs recently negotiated with Brazil, Mexico, and other
countries, U.S. reserve assets are likely to grow substantially in
1983, adding to the financing needs of the U.S. Treasury(although not

Foreign official reserve assets in the United States increased
by $2.8 billion dollars in January. (See line 4 of the table "Summary
of U.S. International Transactions".) Preliminary data indicate that
these assets fell in February and the first half of March.
During the first two and a half months of 1983, available data
sources indicate only small reductions in OPEC official assets held in
the United States, because most financially-pressed OPEC countries
have typically held their funds in the Eurocurrency markets, rather
than directly in the United States.
U.S. banking offices (including IBFs)added somewhat to their net
advances to their foreign offices in February and early March; the
level of net advances by U.S.-chartered banks in the first months of
1983 was substantially higher than the average for 1982. (See table
"International Banking Data".) Data are available through the end of
January only on the balance sheets of the foreign branches of U.S.
banks; they indicate that these large net advances were not used to
finance additional claims. Total claims in fact fell between the

are included in U.S.
beginning of December and the end of January. Instead, the advances
were used to replace other sources of funds. For example, foreign
branch liabilities to U.S. nonbanks fell by $8 billion between
November 30 and January 31. These financing shifts probably reflected
both the increased availability of funds at domestic offices and the
reduced demand for the liabilities of foreign offices due to the intro-
duction of MMDAs, as discussed in the last Greenbook. An additional

IV-11
factor was probably the continued liquidation of some Eurodollar
investments by financially-pressed OPEC countries. Deposits of the
oil exporting countries in the foreign branches of U.S. banks fell by more
than $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1982.
The Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbank residents fell by about
$3 billion dollars in January, after declining $3 billion dollars in
December. This decline is almost entirely accounted for by the reduced
overnight and term holdings of MMFs during the same period ($2.4
billion and $3.3 billion respectively), and probably reflects the
impact of MMDAs.
The integration of U.S. and offshore financial markets continued
to be evident in recent months. In December and again in January there
were sizable net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks by foreigners.
(See line 2b of the Summary Table of U.S. International Transactions.)
In addition, during the first quarter of 1983, borrowing by U.S.
corporations through the issuance of Eurobonds was substantial. (See
the table "Publicized Borrowing in the Eurodollar Bond Market by U.S.
Firms.") Another example of the increased use by U.S. corporations of
offshore financial markets is the recently-signed loan agreement
between Walt Disney Productions and a syndicate led by Japanese banks;
it is the first yen syndication led by Japanese banks for a U.S.
corporation. It may reflect a more favorable official Japanese
attitude toward the wider use of the yen in international credit
arrangements.

Two aspects of the recently released U.S. balance of payments
data for 1982 are worth noting. First, there was an unprecedented
net inflow of funds in the direct investment accounts from foreign
affiliates to their U.S. parents. This was mainly the result of the
large Eurobond borrowings by U.S. corporations through their
Netherlands Antilles finance affiliates. Second, the statistical
discrepancy in the accounts increased to about $42 billion, casting
doubt upon the accuracy of the recorded data for both the current and
capital accounts.Gross

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In January, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was $31 billion,
annual rate, down slightly from December, but almost $20 billion smaller
than the average rate for second-half of 1982. However, monthly trade
data often move quite erratically, sharply reversing previous months'
developments, and the data for December-January should probably not be
viewed as establishing a new trend.
While exports in January increased somewhat from December levels
most of the rise was associated with special factors affecting exports
of wheat, civilian aircraft, and petroleum products. Wheat deliveries
to the Soviet Union under contracts made in December were begun in
January and the monthly seasonal factor accentuated the January increase;

first-quarter wheat exports may well increase from the level in the
fourth quarter but probably not as much as the January data suggest. The
strong increase in civilian aircraft exports in January is also associated
with seasonal factors and is not expected to persist (the seasonally
adjusted value was about twice the unadjusted value).
Petroleum product exports were up strongly in January, and, accord-
ing to oil industry sources, the increase was probably price related.
In January the price of some petroleum products, mainly heating oil,
was about 7 cents per gallon higher in Rotterdam than in New York. With
shipping costs estimated at about 4 cents per gallon and the present lack
of restrictions on petroleum product exports, domestic oil companies had
a strong incentive to export. This price differential still exists
(through mid-March). Most of the January export increase was to the
Netherlands, France, Italy, and Japan.
Other exports in January were little changed from low December and
fourth-quarter levels.
The level of imports in January was up somewhat from December
levels despite a drop in oil imports. Oil imports fell to the lowest
level since last May, to 4.4 million barrels per day (from 5.2 mbd in
December and 5.5 mbd in the fourth quarter of 1982. In January, oil

prices declined about 35 cents per barrel from December levels to average
$30.48 per barrel most of the imports recorded in January were shipped
before the end of 1982 and, therefore, do not reflect recent price
declines. The sharp increase in nonoil imports in January was primarily
in manufactured goods, but month-to-month changes in nonoil imports are
very erratic. The average level of nonoil imports in December-January
was still less than during much of 1982, and partly reflected the weak-
ness of U.S. economic activity and also the sharp liquidation of U.S.
business inventories that took place in the fourth quarter.
U.S. Current Account: 4Q82 and Year 1982.
The U.S. current account deficit in the fourth quarter was slightly
larger than in the third quarter. See the table on the next page. For
the year 1982 as a whole, the current account was in deficit by $8
billion in contrast to a small surplus in 1981.
For the year, the swing into deficit resulted primarily from
larger trade deficits (exports declined more than imports declined,
particularly in the second half of the year). However, there was also a
substantial drop in net direct investment income receipts reflecting
primarily lower profits on foreign business operations.
In the fourth quarter a small reduction in the trade deficit
(imports fell more than exports fell) and an increase in direct invest-
ment income receipts were more than offset by lower net portfolio income
receipts (partly reflecting lower interest rates) and larger unilateral
transfers abroad (primarily economic aid program disbursements at the
beginning of a new fiscal year).

*/ The persistence of large positive statistical discrepancies which have occurred in
in the last four years and especially the $42 billion statistical discrepancy last year,
has made it increasingly difficult to asses the accuracy of the measured current account
based on balance-of-payments data. If the cumulated statistical discrepancies were
interpreted as being entirely net capital inflows, interest payments to foreigners and
the current account deficit would be understated. Alternatively, if the entire
discrepancy were interpreted as unreported service receipts, the current account may well
have been in surplus in 1982.

Foreign Economic Developments. The weak pace of real economic
activity abroad earlier in 1982 continued into the fourth quarter. Real
GNP fell further in Canada and Germany, while in Japan it rose only
slightly. Industrial production fell in December and January in Italy.
The only countries to experience significant real growth in the fourth
quarter were the United Kingdom and France. Preliminary indications for
1983 suggest, however, that recovery in activity is now beginning in
several major industrial countries. Industrial production jumped
sharply in January in Germany and rose above its year-earlier levels in
the United Kingdom in December and January. The Canadian rate of
unemployment actually declined on average in January and February.
Improved inflation performance continued in most countries.
Although some benefits from government assistance to residential
construction and other fiscal programs appear to be emerging in Germany
and Canada, the general stance of current and projected fiscal policy
abroad remains one of restraint. Overall budgets for Germany are
restrictive both for this year and the next. In Italy measures to
contain the government deficit have been adopted, and in France such
measures are expected following the recent elections. Japanese
authorities may accelerate spending although the total amount for the
fiscal year is being restricted. In Canada only modest stimulus is
expected in the April budget while in the United Kingdom the recently
announced budget calls for some reductions in taxes but no increase in
the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement from this year's low level.
On March 9 the Belgian National Bank raised its official lending
rates by 2.5 percentage points while on March 14 cuts in official rates

IV -19
of 1 percentage point were announced by Germany and Austria and of 0.5
percentage points, by the Netherlands and Switzerland. A realignment
within the EMS followed on March 21 with the mark and the guilder
appreciating relative to the other member currencies by varying amounts.
Belgian National Bank lowered its official rates 3 percentage points
three days later.
German industrial production jumped by 4 percent (monthly rate) in
January, although the recorded increase may exaggerate the pickup in
activity. The volume of orders also rose sharply in January, following
strong increases in November and December. Business surveys indicate
a continuation of the improvement in business climate which began late
last year. Part of the apparent recent strength in economic activity is
attributable to specific incentives provided by the government last
year, such as support for private housing. In addition, an investment
credit program covering orders placed through December 31, 1982 probably
caused a concentration of orders late last year and thus explains not
only the strong order figures at that time, but also part of the jump in
production in January. However, the order volume continued to grow
strongly past the deadline, as noted above, with foreign orders playing
a larger role than before. These factors, together with the uniformly
positive comments of the business sector on the recent election victory
of the center-right government, appear to have improved the investment
climate.
The rate of consumer price inflation has slowed further, to a
monthly rate of 0.1 percent in February. The annual rate for the eight
months to February was just over 2 percent. The seasonally adjusted

IV -20
CPI (not shown on the attached table) fell by 0.3 percent in January,
the first drop that large since World War II. Major contracts in the
annual wage round are expected to be announced during the next few
weeks. Indications are that the average rate of wage increases may be
around 3 percent.
Monetary policy has continued to ease and short-term interest rates
have fallen by about another percentage point since the beginning of the
year. The growth of Central Bank Money (CBM) accelerated sharply to 11
percent (a.r.) in February relative to the fourth-quarter 1982 base for
the 4 to 7 percent target range. This level of CBM was so far above
target that subsequent growth would have to be greatly reduced (although
still positive) in order to reach the upper limit of the target by the
end of the year. Nevertheless, the Bundesbank cut both the discount and
Lombard rates one percentage point to 4 and 5 percent, respectively, on
March 14. At the same time rediscount quotas were reduced, thus
eliminating as yet unused portions of the quotas that had been created
when quotas were increased earlier this year.
The current account was in balance in January, after large
surpluses in November and December. In January of last year the current
account was in deficit by more than $1 billion.
In Japan fourth quarter GNP grew 1.8 percent (s.a.a.r) despite the
fact that for that period industrial production and investment
indicators were down. Continued sluggishness in economic activity was
evident in the higher unemployment rate, 2.7 percent (s.a.) in January
compared with 2.4 percent six months earlier, and the fact that

IV -21
industrial production (s.a.) fell again in January. Declines in the
inflation rate continued into 1983. In February the Tokyo CPI 12-month
rate of change fell to 2.4 percent while the February WPI was 1 percent
below its year-earlier level. Japan's January trade and current account
surpluses, $2.1 and $1.3 billion respectively, were the largest since
the autumn of 1981.
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government is currently
wrestling with the problem of timing its fiscal policies. It is likely
the government will again engage in "front loading" of its public works
expenditures into the first half of the fiscal year. Although the
"front loading" undertaken in FY 1982 was of little apparent help in
stimulating sustained expansion of the economy, the LDP will likely
follow this policy again this year to limit losses in upcoming by-
elections.
In the United Kingdom real GDP grew in the fourth quarter of 1982
at 3.4 percent (s.a.a.r.). Increases in industrial production
in both December and January (s.a.) have raised that index to 2.2
percent above its year-earlier level in the latter month; total housing
starts (s.a.) in Britain rose vigorously in the three months November to
January to an average level 34 percent higher than that for the
equivalent year-earlier period. Although there are these increasing
indications of recovery, unemployment continued to rise slowly. The
rate in February was 12.9 percent (s.a.), compared with 12.2 percent six
months earlier.
Progress continued in lowering the inflation rate. The February
retail price index stood 5 percent above its year-earlier level while

IV -22
the equivalent figure for six months earlier was 8 percent. Wholesale
price inflation has also abated, but not as much. In February the
wholesale price index was 7 percent above its February 1982 level. The
January current account deficit of $400 million was the first monthly
deficit since mid-1981. The trade balance was also in deficit in
January, $770 million, after recording a surplus of $3.5 billion for
1982.
The government budget for fiscal year 1983/84 has just been
announced by Chancellor Howe. Targets were set for 7-11 percent annual
growth in M1, £M3, and PSL2. Through February all three aggregates
were within last year's 8-12 percent target growth range. Fiscal policy
will remain restrained, with an expected Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement (PSBR) of about £8 billion, approximately 2-3/4 percent of
GDP. Some expansionary measures were proposed, however. Expenditure
increases will include additional benefits in employment programs,
increased child allowances, and higher capital expenditure on housing
construction. There will be no change in the present VAT rate; however,
some excise taxes will be raised. Taxes will be reduced on oil revenues
from newly developed fields, on employment (in the form of a change from
1.5 to 1 percent in August of the National Insurance Surcharge), and on
small and medium-sized companies (through changes in the corporation tax
applicable to them). Finally, the personal income tax brackets will be
adjusted by more than enough to compensate for the effects of inflation
on income. Altogether the tax changes introduced in the budget were
estimated to add £1.5 billion to the 1983-84 PSBR.

IV -23
Real GNP in Canada contracted by 4.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
fourth quarter of 1982 as inventory runoffs accelerated and exports
weakened. However, in contrast to declines during the preceding five
quarters of recession, final domestic demand expanded modestly in the
fourth quarter. This turnaround was mainly due to strength in
residential construction which was spurred by government assistance
programs as well as by lower interest rates, but non-residential
construction and consumption were also up. The unemployment rate in
February was 12.5 percent, about unchanged from January and below the
12.75 percent level of the October-December period.
The trend of inflation has changed sharply. In the eight months
ending with February of this year, the monthly increase in the CPI
averaged about a third of the 12 percent annual pace registered during
the first half of 1982. About one-half of this improvement consisted of
favorable movements in food and energy prices. Wage demands also
moderated considerably last year. Annual increases called for over the
life of wage contracts negotiated in the fourth quarter (excluding those
with COLAs) averaged 7.3 percent, down from 12.8 percent in the first
quarter and 13.3 percent in 1981.
The current account surplus strengthened slightly in the fourth
quarter. For 1982 as a whole, the current account surplus reached a
record $2.1 billion as the trade balance more than doubled to $14.5
billion, also a record.
The new federal government budget is expected in April and is now
likely to contain stimulus, but on a modest scale.
French GDP (s.a.), led by strong export growth, increased at an

IV -24
annual rate near 2-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1982; between
the fourth quarters of 1981 and 1982 GNP increased 1-1/2 percent.
Although industrial production increased in January, it was unchanged
from the average for the fourth quarter of 1982 and below its year-
earlier level. Stocks are falling to normal levels; and orders, while
low, are stable. Industrialists expect little increase in economic
activity over the next several months.
In 1982 consumer price inflation on a fourth-quarter to fourth-
quarter basis fell to about 9-1/2 percent from more than 14 percent in
1981, at least in part due to the 4-1/2 month price freeze. In the
three months since the end of October, when the price freeze was
modified, consumer prices have risen at an annual rate over 11-1/2
percent. The government hopes to keep the inflation rate below 9
percent in 1983.
Both the trade and current account deficits in the middle quarters
of 1982 were at record rates. By the fourth quarter the current account
deficit had been nearly halved but remained above $2 billion. The trade
deficit fell in the final quarter of 1982, but in January it rose to
about $1.4 billion, the average monthly rate of the record third
quarter.
M2 growth in France was held below 12 percent in 1982, below the
target range of 12-1/2 -13-1/2 percent. The target for this year aims
at a significant reduction to 10 percent. Credit controls have been
tightened. Housing loans and export finance continue to be favored, but
consumer loans have been frozen.
The 1983 budget seeks to limit the government budget deficit to 3

IV -25
percent of GDP, but real expenditure is still scheduled to increase by
more than 4 percent. The recent municipal elections have not yet
elicited major arrangements of policy change announcements, but measures
to restrain consumption and increase investment are generally expected
now that the elections are over and a new cabinet has been formed.
In Italy, 1982 ended with another decline in industrial production.
The December IP figure was about 6 percent below that of the previous
December, with most sectors sharing in this decline. A slight further
decline in industrial production occurred in January. In recent months,
consumer price inflation has slowed somewhat. In the 3-month period
ending in February, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 15.3
percent over the previous 3 months; in the corresponding period a year
earlier, the CPI jumped by almost 19 percent. The deceleration of
wholesale prices hasbeen more marked, and in January the WPI was 11.1
percent above its year-earlier level.
Despite the weakness of economic activity, the Fanfani government
has persisted in its attempts to reduce the public sector deficit. On
February 26, the Parliament approved some of the government's fiscal
measures which were designed to limit the deficit to 71 trillion lire.
The measures approved were mainly increases in various taxes; the
Parliament has yet to pass any expenditure cuts and, in fact, on March
18 approved an additional 1 trillion lire spending package. Revised
budget projections suggest that a further 9 trillion lire will have to
be trimmed from the budget in order to attain the government's
objective. Treasury Minister Goria has suggested that these cuts may
come in the areas of social security, health care, and the investment

IV -26
and employment fund. The high rate of government borrowing has been
cited as an important factor in the slight decline to date in interest
rates relative to the decline in inflation.
Belgian authorities acted to relieve severe exchange market
pressure on the franc prior to the EMS realignment. On March 9, the
Belgian National Bank raised its official lending rates by 2.5
percentage points, and the following week emergency exchange controls
were imposed which sharply.curtailed the ability of Belgian residents to
acquire and hold foreign currency. As a result of the EMS realignment
on March 21, the Belgian franc was devalued relative to the mark and
quilder while being revalued relative to the other EMS currencies.
Following the realignment the Belgian National Bank reduced its official
lending rates by 3 percentage points.
