The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMMENTS
The recovery in economic activity continued to strengthen in April
as both production and employment rose rapidly. April's output gain
reflected reduced inventory levels in conjunction with a further advance
in household sector spending. At the same time, the contraction in busi-
ness equipment outlays appears to be ending. Underlying cost pressures
on prices have moderated further, but the extremely favorable developments
in energy and food prices seen earlier in the year were partly reversed
in April.
Industrial Production
Industrial production rose 2.1 percent in April, the largest increase
so far this year. Since its trough in November, industrial production has
risen about 6 percent, with production increases most pronounced in auto-
and housing-related industries. In April, output gains were widespread
among a wide range of final products and materials. Large advances were
recorded for home goods such as appliances, carpeting, and furniture.
Output of construction supplies rose substantially for a fourth month
in a row. Even business equipment output, which had been contracting
sharply until February, increased 1.8 percent in April after a moderate
gain the month before. Among the major components of business equipment,
only building and mining equipment continued to decline in April as
weakness persisted in oil and gas well drilling.
Autos were assemblied at an annual rate of 5.9 million units in
April--up slightly further from March and significantly improved over
the 4.5 million unit rate in November; given the reduced level of
stocks relative to sales, automakers are planning to step up assemblies

further in May and June. Raw steel production, although still quite
low by historical standards, has increased 45 percent from its trough.
Output of home goods and construction supplies in April were about 10
percent above their levels at the end of 1982. These production gains
helped to lift capacity utilization rates in manufacturing and at mate-
rials producers from their record lows to around 71 percent in April.
Employment and Unemployment
Rising output in the industrial sector over the past five months
has been accompanied by a strengthening in labor demand. Total nonfarm
payroll employment grew 260,000 in April and is now two-thirds of a mil-
lion above its December low. The bulk of April's job gains occurred in
two major sectors--the services industry and manufacturing. Employment
growth in services had slowed during the recession, but now appears to
be resuming its upward secular trend. In manufacturing, employment rose
more than 100,000-mostly in durable goods industries--bringing the cumu-
lative rebound in factory jobs since December to 250,000. Manufacturers
have relied heavily on overtime to meet production schedules; indeed,
the factory workweek has rebounded more vigorously than in past cycles
and already is close to its pre-recession level.
The civilian unemployment rate edged down again in April to 10.2
percent. In recent months, short-term joblessness and the layoff rate
have continued to decline, albeit very gradually; most of the reduction
in these cyclically-sensitive series came in January or February. In
contrast, the large number of workers unemployed longer than 26 weeks
has not yet receded. The labor force participation rate edged up in
April, but retraced only a portion of the unusually large decline
earlier in the year.

Inventory Investment
Businesses continued to draw down inventories at a rapid rate during
the first quarter. Total manufacturing and trade inventories in book
value terms fell at a $37-1/2 billion annual rate after a similar large
contraction in the fourth quarter. The recent inventory liquidation was
accompanied by a sizable advance in shipments and sales, bringing the
level of stocks into much better balance with final demands and thus
laying the groundwork for April's strong gain in production. Although
some businesses--particularly in the trade sector--may pare stocks further
during the next few months, the runoff in inventories appears to be
ending at many manufacturers and at auto dealers. Thus, on balance, a
swing away from very rapid liquidation should add significantly to output
growth in the second quarter.
In March, manufacturing inventories declined at an annual rate of
$46 billion in book value terms after a small liquidation in February. By
the end of March, the book value of total manufacturing stocks was 6 percent
below the level of mid-1981; only a few durable goods industries--notably
nonelectrical machinery--were carrying inventories that were not in line
with sales by historical standards. In the trade sector, retail stocks
were liquidated at a $16 billion annual rate in March with about two-thirds
of the runoff occurring in autos. Some overhangs persisted at nonauto
stores such as those in the GAF grouping. At merchant wholesalers,
inventories still were quite unbalanced in March, despite a sizable
liquidation throughout the first quarter.

Personal Income and Consumption
Growth of private wage and salary income began to pick up in the
first quarter and accelerated in April, reflecting strong gains in
employment and the workweek that month. Real disposable income only
rose at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, and likely
rose again in April. Real outlays for personal consumption have been
growing about in line with disposable income, and the personal saving
rate has remained near its fourth-quarter level of 6 percent.
Retail sales increased 1.6 percent in April, following a similar
advance in March that was considerably stronger than initially estimated.
Increased spending on new autos was a major factor in the April gain.
Domestic cars sold at a 6.4 million unit annual rate after hovering
close to a 6 million unit rate since November, and increased somewhat
further in early May. Foreign car sales dropped again in April because
of depleted inventories of some Japanese models. With the beginning of
a new quota year for Japanese exports in April, sales of imported cars
are expected to rebound in May as they did last year. Total retail
sales also were boosted by a 3 percent rise in outlays at gasoline
stations; most or all of the increase probably was attributable to
higher prices associated with the April 1 hike in federal gasoline
taxes.
Spending for consumer goods other than automobiles and gasoline
has been increasing moderately--up 1/2 percent in both March and April.

Outlays for furniture and appliances have been quite brisk, probably
reflecting the recovery in housing markets, but sales at general
merchandise stores remain sluggish. Consumer surveys point toward an
improvement in consumer demand. Both the Conference Board and the
Michigan Survey Research Center have reported strong increases in their
measures of consumer confidence since the beginning of the year.
Housing Markets
Total private housing starts retreated further in April from the
unusually high levels early this year; but, at an annual rate of 1.5
million units, starts were still nearly 20 percent above the rates
reached in late 1982. Newly-issued permits rose to 1.56 million units
in April, with a particularly large increase for multifamily units.
A good deal of this year's strength in residential construction
activity has been in the multifamily sector. Multifamily starts have
averaged just under 600,000 units (annual rate) since the first of the
year--a level of activity not sustained since the early 1970s. Available
information suggests that much of the strength has been in rental units.
A number of factors have enhanced profitability in the rental market,
including a dramatic slowdown in operating cost increases relative to
rental receipts, the more favorable treatment of depreciation for federal
income tax purposes effective last year, and more favorable financing
terms that have bolstered housing markets generally. Other factors also
may have provided a temporary stimulus in recent months, such as a spurt
in the use of special tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
Construction and sales of single-family housing also have shown
considerable improvement from last year. Single-family start averaged

1.06 million units at an annual rate during the first four months of
1983--up 30 percent from the fourth-quarter pace. Sales of new houses
jumped 14 percent in the first quarter. Sales of existing houses,
which had been slower to pick up than new house sales, rose quite
rapidly in early 1983, with the March sales rate up 20 percent from
the pace at year end. The increase in sales volume during the last
several quarters has yet to generate any rebound in house prices. The
average price of existing houses sold in March was 3 percent above a
year earlier, and new house prices in the first quarter (adjusted for
quality changes and regional mix) were barely 1 percent above a year
earlier.
Business Fixed Investment
The long contraction in demand for capital equipment now appears
to be ending, but investment in nonresidential structures shows signs of
weakening. Business spending on producers' durable equipment increased
1.5 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter after more than a
year of deterioration. Increased spending occurred primarily in office
and store machinery, fabricated metals, and motor vehicles. In addition,
new orders for nondefense capital goods have begun to show some improve-
ment. A particularly sharp jump in March brought new orders (excluding
aircraft) in line with recent shipments. Thus, the backlog of unfilled
orders, which had fallen by nearly 30 percent since the beginning of
the recession, now appears to be stabilizing. At the same time,
private nonresidential construction put-in-place fell precipitiously
in real terms during both February and March, bringing the first-quarter
average to a level 4 percent below that of the fourth quarter. Much of

the decrease was in industrial building, but spending on office buildings
also fell; considering high financing costs and rising vacancy rates,
expenditures on office buildings had been relatively bouyant during the
recession.
Surveys of capital spending plans by McGraw-Hill and Merrill-Lynch
are still generally pessimistic. The McGraw-Hill spring survey showed
an anticipated decline of about 1 percent in nominal investment spending
in 1983, along with expected price increases for capital goods of about
5.5 percent. Similarly, the Merrill-Lynch spring survey projected a
nominal decline of about 2 percent this year.
Federal Government
For the first half of fiscal year 1983 ended in March, the unified
federal government budget deficit totaled $129 billion, about $57 billion
larger than the deficit recorded in the comparable period a year earlier.
The widening deficit reflects rapid growth in some outlay programs as well
as the effects of lower levels of economic activity and of tax law changes.
Outlays have risen substantially for social security retirement, medicare,
and medicaid.
Federal purchases of goods and services also have trended higher due
to the buildup in defense spending and larger farm price support activities.
In the first quarter, however, these upward trends were interrupted when
real purchases by the federal goverment declined sharply, largely because
CCC purchases dropped back from the record pace of late 1982. This
decline was an important factor restraining first-quarter growth in the
final sales. Outlays for unemployment compensation also declined between
the fourth quarter and the first quarter as the rate of new layoffs fell.

In terms of the unified budget, revenues in the first half of the
fiscal year were $13 billion below a year earlier. Most of the decline
reflects a sharp drop in net corporate tax liabilities, although indivi-
dual tax receipts also were lower. More recently, net tax receipts in
April and May have been held down by personal tax refunds that were
larger than usual because of the expanded use of IRA-Keough accounts.
The Administration and Congress continue to debate the size and
shape of the federal budget. Deficit estimates in the Administration's
April update were revised up slightly for both FY 1983 and FY 1984. The
revisions reflected the largely offsetting effects of recently completed
spending bills and of revised economic assumptions that project stronger
real output growth and lower inflation in 1983. Relative to the Adminis-
tration's estimates, the House budget resolution for FY 1984 calls for
some $30 billion more in receipts and $20 billion more in outlays; this
represents a $6 billion spending increase compared with current law.
The Senate has not yet been able to resolve the impasse between those
who want to increase tax revenues and spend more for domestic programs
(partly in lieu of defense programs) and others who want a budget reso-
lution that follows the Administration's recommendations more closely.
State and Local Government
State and local government purchases rose slightly in real terms
in the first quarter. These purchases have been practically unchanged
for a year. The major component of spending, employee compensation,
has been declining steadily, and the contraction in employment that
began more than two years ago continued through April. In contrast,
state and local construction expenditures, which represent 10 percent

II-18
of total purchases, registered a moderate gain of 2.3 percent at an
annual rate in the first quarter. This increase may be the beginning
of an upward trend in state and local construction, supported by in-
creased federal grants for highway and community development projects.
The prospect of large deficits for the current fiscal year has
forced many states and localities to take measures to reduce expendi-
tures or to raise revenues. At least 12 states already have raised
income or sales taxes this year, and Illinois and Michigan are con-
sidering large tax increases to cover projected deficits. As a result
of these actions and the improvement in economic activity, both per-
sonal and indirect tax collections by state and local governments
rose substantially in the first quarter. Growth in the property tax
component of these receipts--a major source of revenue for cities and
counties--also was strong.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage inflation has continued to trend lower this year. The
employment cost index--a comprehensive wage measure covering all
private nonfarm wage and salary workers--rose at less than a 4 percent
annual rate from December through March, down from a 6-1/4 percent
increase last year. Moreover, April data from the hourly earnings
index for production workers suggest that the moderate wage trend is
continuing into the second quarter. The deceleration has been very
broadly based, affecting nearly all major industrial and occupational
groups.
In many depressed industries, the reduction in wage adjustments
has been particularly dramatic. During the first quarter, half of the

II-19
union workers reaching new major settlements took initial pay cuts and
another one-sixth accepted wage freezes, bringing the cumulative number
of union workers involved in such concessions to 2 million. A large
portion of these workers still are covered by cost-of-living clauses,
but recently escalator provisions have contributed little to wage increases
and in some cases generated wage cuts. Outside of concession situations,
the size of union wage settlements has dropped markedly as well.
Hourly compensation, which includes nonwage labor costs as well as
wages, rose at a 6 percent annual rate in the first quarter. About 1
percentage point of the increase can be attributed to legislated changes
in payroll taxes effective January 1. At the same time, nonfarm produc-
tivity posted a strong cyclical gain of 4-3/4 percent at an annual rate.
Output per hour typically rebounds in the first quarter of a recovery
because large production gains initially are possible by increasing the
efficiency of an underutilized work force and capital stock. Still,
this latest increase--coming after a reasonably good performance in 1982
when output was declining--suggests that the underlying productivity
trend may have improved from its anemic 0.6 percent growth rate of the
1970s. Increased productivity, coupled with the slowing in hourly
compensation, has cut the rise in unit labor costs sharply to 3-1/2
percent over the last four quarters--down from 9 percent in 1981.
Prices
Most aggregate inflation measures have shown low or negative rates
so far in 1983. The gross business product fixed-weighted price index
rose at only a 2.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter. Consumer
prices as measured by the index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) were

II-20
almost flat over the first three months of 1983, and at the producer
level the index of finished goods actually fell at nearly a 4 percent
annual rate from December to April.
Rapidly declining prices for petroleum products held down these
inflation rates during the first quarter. However, prices of refined
petroleum products stabilized after the latest OPEC agreement in March.
In addition, all of the April 1 increase of 5 cents per gallon in the
federal gasoline tax apparently was passed on to consumers according to
survey data. At the same time, food prices at the producer level in-
creased rapidly in April. Farm policies have helped to boost prices
sharply for a number of key crops this year, and bad weather during the
spring has led to large price increases for some foodstuffs such as
fruits and vegetables. These much less favorable developments in food
and energy prices should temporarily worsen overall inflation measures
during the next few months.
More fundamentally, however, labor cost pressures on prices have
continued to moderate, and inflation rates for goods and services aside
from food and energy still are trending lower. Consumer prices excluding
food and energy items rose at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate in the first
quarter with an exceptionally low increase in March. The inflation rate
for services in March was only about 1-1/2 percent (annual rate). Even
price increases for medical services slowed in March, although they
still were above those for most other consumer goods and services. At
the producer level, capital equipment prices have risen at less than a
2 percent annual rate this year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The monetary aggregates were very weak in April, but--especially in
the case of M1--appear to be rebounding in May. M1 contracted in April
after an extended period of extremely rapid growth; however, in recent
years deposit flows have tended to be highly volatile in the spring, leav-
ing room for considerable uncertainty regarding underlying growth rates.
It seems quite likely that M2 growth was damped to a degree by the record
last-minute surge in IRA/Keogh contributions; much smaller inflows to MMDAs
probably also played a role. Owing to the sharp slowdown in M2, M3 decel-
erated further in April despite the first increase in large time deposits
since last November.
Short-term market interest rates have declined 35 to 65 basis points,
on balance, since the March 29 FOMC meeting, while long-term rates have
declined by 10 to 45 basis points. Long rates reached new cyclical lows
during the intermeeting period, but the most recent direction of both long
and short rates has been upward as stronger monetary and economic data have
dimmed hopes of a near-term easing in money market conditions. The improved
economic picture, however, evidently has contributed to a decided narrowing
of risk premiums in interest rates and new record highs for major stock
price indexes.
The Treasury has been a heavy borrower thus far in the second quarter,
principally in long-term markets, as it runs a sizable deficit despite the
seasonal rise in tax receipts. Long-term borrowing by state and local gov-
ernments appears to be picking up again, far outstripping current spending
needs. Stronger consumer durables spending and increased S&L mortgage
commitments suggest that household borrowing may be running ahead of the

increased first-quarter pace. Meanwhile, in the nonfinancial business sec-
tor, overall external funding needs probably are low, but firms have raised
large sums in the bond and equity markets to repay short-term debt and
otherwise improve balance sheets.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 declined in April at a 3 percent annual rate after eight consecu-
tive months of double-digit or near double-digit growth. Even so, from the
fourth quarter of 1982 to April, M1 grew at an 11-1/2 percent annual rate
and remains well above the long-run growth target range of 4 to 8 percent.
Other checkable deposits declined in April for the first time since October
1981, in striking contrast to the nearly 50 percent annual rate of growth
for such accounts in the first quarter of this year. Inflows to Super
NOWs--which currently amount to about one quarter of outstanding OCD--con-
tinued to slow in April; the flow actually turned negative immediately after
the tax date.
Owing in part to the varying patterns of tax payments and refunds, M1
tends to be highly volatile in the spring and the contraction last month
likely overstates any underlying weakening in M1 growth.1 The early-May
surge in M1 seems to be consistent with this notion.
The broader monetary aggregates also decelerated sharply in April. M2
edged up at only a 3 percent annual rate after growing at an annual rate of
20 percent in the first quarter, about half of which is estimated to have
1. There has been considerable speculation that the revised seasonal factors
used this year which, based on an additional year of data, had the effect of
substantially lowering M1 growth for last April and raising it for last May,
may have been off the mark. While, ex post, the behavior of seasonally
adjusted M1 in recent weeks is consistent with this view, it is of interest
to note that the experimental model-based seasonal adjustment procedure
yields a rather similar M1 growth rate for April of this year.

resulted from inflows to MMDAs from outside M2. With April being the first
month following the February-March base period, M2 now lies below its 7-to-
10 percent growth target range set by the FOMC in February. The weakness
in M2 in April was accounted for not only by the contraction in narrow money
but also by a further deceleration of its nontransactions component.
The slowdown in the nontransactions component coincided with dimin-
ished inflows to MMDAs to roughly half the March pace. However, MMDAs
apparently continued to draw balances from MMMFs as rates on MMDAs remained
above those offered by money market mutual funds, and outflows from general
purpose and broker/dealer money market funds continued at around the pace
of February and March.
Also contributing to the deceleration of M2 in April were large in-
flows to IRA and Keogh accounts. IRA/Keogh balances, which are excluded
from measures of the money stock, surged more than $6 billion in April at
depository institutions and MMMFs, as individuals rushed to lower their
1982 taxable income before the mid-April tax deadline. This is well above
the $3 billion monthly average in the first quarter of this year or the
$1-1/2 billion average in the second half of last year.
Reflecting the weakness in M2, M3 growth also decelerated sharply in
April, to a 4-1/2 percent annual rate, leaving M3 in the upper portion of
its 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent growth target range. Institution-only money
funds continued to contract in April while term RPs rose sharply. Large
time deposits registered their first monthly increase since MMDAs were in-
troduced. The rise in large CDs was concentrated at S&Ls, where acquisition
of mortgage assets has strengthened recently. Since late 1982 interest
rates on S&L CDs have fallen substantially relative to rates on commercial

bank CDs, apparently in response to lessened investor concern about these
institutions, and S&Ls may have taken advantage of the more attractive
rates to prepay costly FHLB advances, as well as to acquire assets.
At commercial banks, large time deposits were about flat in April
following sharp runoffs in the previous four months. Such CD runoffs have
been concentrated at large banks and represent these banks' principal bal-
ance sheet adjustment to MMDA inflows, although large banks also have
acquired sizable amounts of Treasury securities, and earlier had advanced
funds to their foreign offices, mostly in January. Small banks, which have
relied less heavily on managed liabilities, have adjusted to MMDA inflows
largely by acquiring Treasury securities.
In the first quarter of this year, commercial banks and thrift insti-
tutions, flush with funds as a result of MMDA inflows, accounted for close
to half of the net funds supplied in credit markets, well above their share
in the previous two years but about in line with their historical share.
By contrast, net investments by MMMFs contracted in the first quarter and
direct direct acquisitions of credit market instruments by private domestic
nonfinancial sectors are estimated to have slowed.
In April, growth of loans and securities at commercial banks, at about
a 9 percent annual rate, slowed somewhat from the first-quarter pace. As in
the first quarter, expansion was concentrated in Treasury securities. Loan
growth was very sluggish, owing mostly to the sharpest decline in C&I loans
since April 1976. Real estate loans grew at about the pace of the first
quarter--at a rate about in line with comparable stages of other recent
recoveries--while consumer loans at banks, which have been highly erratic
over recent months, slowed appreciably from the rapid March rate.

Business Finance
Net funds raised by nonfinancial corporations in the first quarter
increased from the slow fourth-quarter pace but remained well below the
quarterly volume of previous years. Improved cash flow and substantial
inventory liquidation reduced the need for external financing. In April,
corporations continued to reduce their heavy reliance on short-term debt
by paying down bank loans and commercial paper with the proceeds from a
large volume of long-term debt and equities.
Gross offerings of public bonds in domestic markets totaled $6.2 bil-
(seasonally adjusted) in April--the largest monthly volume since last Octo-
ber--and continued strong in early May. A large portion of the offerings
in April were issues of industrial firms and utilities, in contrast to
other recent months when financial firms had dominated. Total stock issu-
ance also remained brisk in April, albeit somewhat below the record pace
of March. Industrial firms were the major issuers as financial firms sold
only small amounts of new stock in April, following several months of heavy
issuance of adjustable-rate preferreds.
Long-term financing has been encouraged by further advances in stock
and bond prices. Stock prices have moved up sharply since the last FOMC
meeting, repeatedly setting new record highs for the major market indexes.
The current rise in stock prices, which began last August, has exceeded
previous cyclical expansions in stock prices over comparable time periods
(see chart on page III-11). However, stock prices in real terms, while
also up sharply, remain low relative to levels of the early 1970s and late
1960s. Similarly, although the price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 stocks

has risen considerably, it remains low historically--giving further cre-
dence to the view that real interest rates currently are relatively high.
Corporate bond yields have declined about 45 basis points since the
last FOMC meeting, reaching their lowest level since July 1980. Both the
rate spread of prime corporate bonds over Treasuries and the spread between
high-quality and low-quality corporates have narrowed to their lowest levels
since 1979. Lower-rated firms have stepped up their debt offerings to take
advantage of the more receptive mood of investors.
Government Finance
Federal sector. The Treasury is expected to borrow $38 billion, net,
in the current quarter--an unprecedented amount for a second quarter--to
finance a nearly $30 billion deficit and build up its cash balance. A lit-
tle little less than $37 billion will be raised by selling marketable debt.
Owing to a runoff of cash management bills of about $15 billion just after
April 15, bill auctions are not expected to raise any new cash. Through
mid-May, the Treasury has raised $21.7 billion of new money by means of cou-
pon issues. Additional financing needs probably will be met through regu-
lar cycles of 2-, 4-, and 5-year notes, bringing total net coupon sales in
the quarter to a shade more than in the first quarter.1
Another $1-1/2 billion, net, is expected to be raised through nonmar-
ketable borrowing in the second quarter. Issues of savings bonds are ex-
pected to raise about $700 million. The remainder reflects state and local
government acquisition of special nonmarketable debt issues with the pro-
ceeds of debt refinancings.
1. Over the next few weeks, Congressional delays in raising the debt ceil-
ing may disrupt Treasury financing patterns.

III-14
Federally sponsored credit agencies have continued to pay down their
outstanding debt, with net repayments of $2 billion estimated for April.
The Federal Home Loan Banks retired about $1-1/2 billion, reflecting repay-
ments of outstanding advances by thrift institutions. FNMA reduced its
outstanding liabilities by almost $900 million for the second month in a
row; but its borrowing in May could be large enough to offset a further
moderate runoff in FHLBS debt.1
State and Local Sector. Interest rates on municipal securities have
declined along with other market rates since the last FOMC meeting. The
spread of medium-grade securities over high-grade securities has fallen to
the lowest level in two years, while the spread of yields on revenue bonds
over yields on general obligation issues has fallen to a record low.2
In early May, offerings of long-term municipal securities were
running at about the very advanced pace of the fourth quarter of 1982. As
in that earlier period, the imminence of registration requirements may have
stimulated acceleration of a good many issues. However, lower interest
rates and a desire to refund older higher-coupon debt--about 20 percent of
1. While FNMA has been purchasing substantial amounts of mortgages, $5 bil-
lion in the first quarter and approximately $1 billion in April, its port-
folio has grown by much less. The first-quarter increase of only $1.5 bil-
lion reflected both a large jump in mortgage repayments and large sales of
mortgages--mostly through issuance of mortgage-backed securities--from the
agency's portfolio.
2. The relatively low risk premiums in municipal markets suggest that the
widely publicized financial problems of the Washington Public Power Supply
System (WPPSS)--the nation's largest issuer of municipal securities--have
not led to widespread investor concerns about quality in the tax-exempt
sector. Nonetheless, a limited number of public utilities, with bond pro-
grams similar to WPPSS's controversial "take or pay" contracts, have paid
slightly higher costs for borrowed funds. WPPSS is facing the possibility
of default at the end of this month on $15.6 million in interest payments
owed the bond trustee.

the gross proceeds from municipal offerings in April were refundings--also
continue to stimulate offerings.

Individuals reportedly remain the primary purchasers of municipal
securities, through purchases of tax-exempt mutual fund shares as well as
direct bond purchases. At the same time, dealers report that increased
purchases by commercial banks and property and casualty insurance compa-
nies in recent weeks, albeit small by historical standards, have helped to
absorb the heavy new-issue volume.
Mortgage Markets
Average interest rates on long-term, fixed-rate conventional home
mortgages at S&Ls have fallen by 27 basis points since the last FOMC meet-
ing to 12.59 percent; secondary market yields have receded by similar
amounts. Reductions in yields on new issues of GNMA-guaranteed pass-through

securities prompted a downward adjustment, effective May 9, of 50 basis
points in the rate ceiling for level-payment FHA/VA home loans to 11-1/2
percent, and a cut of 25 basis points in the limit for graduated-payment
loans to 11-3/4 percent.
Yields on adjustable-rate conventional mortgages (ARMs) purchased by
FNMA in the secondary market generally have declined 50 to 60 basis points,
reflecting declines in the Treasury securities yields employed as indexes
for the various ARM plans.1 FNMA's ARM rates currently are 50 to 200 basis
points below market rates on fixed-rate mortgages; the chart shows rates
prevailing on two of the more popular FNMA plans. Despite the persistence
of yield discounts, the relative importance of ARMs in the home mortgage
market has been declining at both FNMA and private institutional origina-
tors as the general level of market interest rates has fallen from the
highs of last summer. With long-term rates now below 13 percent, increased
proportions of borrowers have refused to accept ARMs without yield conces-
sions bigger than those currently available.
S&Ls have greatly expanded their activity in mortgage markets since
late last year. The volume of their new mortgage commitments in March was
more than double the amount issued as recently as last September, and their
level of mortgage commitments outstanding has risen 60 percent over this
period to a record $38.4 billion. The amount of mortgage loans held by
S&Ls rose for the third consecutive month in March, despite both large
sales of mortgages and a large volume of mortgage retirements (swollen by
refinancings of high-rate loans). However, in March as in other recent

months, mortgage pass-through securities accounted for the bulk of the
increase in total S&L mortgage assets, largely reflecting the continuation
of swap transactions with FNMA and FHLMC.

e--partially estimated.
Total mortgage debt outstanding is estimated to have increased at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $139 billion during the first quarter
of this year, up from $90 billion in the final quarter of 1982. The first-
quarter surge was concentrated in residential lending, particularly for
single-family dwellings. S&Ls and mortgage pools that back issues of fed-
erally guaranteed pass-through securities have accounted for much of the
pickup in lending. Although securities issuance was buoyed by heavy FNMA
and FHLMC securities/mortgage swap transactions with depository institutions,
non-swap issues increased substantially; indeed, the volume of GNMA-guar-

III-19
anteed securities outstanding increased at a record annual rate of $38 bil-
lion in the first quarter.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at a 9 percent annual
rate during March as revolving and automobile credit rebounded strongly
from small February declines. Installment credit growth in the first quar-
ter was more rapid than has been typical of comparable stages of earlier
business cycles.
Some further reductions in consumer loan rates at commercial banks
appear to have occurred recently, partly reflecting promotional programs
and efforts in some states to forestall legislative action to reduce usury
ceilings. Moreover, although credit standards apparently remain stringent,
the February Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated that a histori-
cally large proportion of reporting commercial banks had become increas-
ingly willing to extend installment credit to consumers. In April, auto-
mobile manufacturers offered new concessionary financing at 9.9 percent on
selected models. From October 1982 through March, average customer rates
at finance companies on new-car contracts declined roughly 450 basis points
to about 12 percent, reflecting the special financing programs offered by
auto manufacturers.
During the first quarter, delinquency rates on consumer installment
auto credit at finance companies fell to the lowest level in more than 14
years. In addition, personal bankruptcy cases filed during January and
February were about 12 percent below the record level of the fourth quarter
of 1982. In the mortgage area, however, delinquencies at savings and loan
associations during the first quarter remained at the postwar high reached
in the preceding quarter.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown in the upper panel of the chart, the weighted average
value of the dollar has fluctuated in a narrow band since late March and
is currently about one-half percent lower than it was at the time of the
last FOMC meeting. The dollar's depreciation is in association with a
one-half percent decline in U.S. short term interest rates relative to a
weighted average of foreign interest rates, and may have been tempered by
disturbances in Poland. On a bilateral basis, as shown in the lower
panel of the chart, the pound has appreciated about seven percent against
the dollar, the yen has appreciated about three percent, the Swiss franc
has appreciated about one and one-half percent, and the mark has depre-
ciated about one and one-half percent.
The appreciation of the pound, which had reached a trough at the
time of the last FOMC meeting, seems to be predominantly a result of
developments in international oil markets and the political situation in
the United Kingdom. In late March the British National Oil Corporation
reduced the price of its crude oil by only 50 cents/barrel, alleviating
fears of a reduction large enough to induce OPEC to retaliate. Since
then spot prices have firmed to about the level of official OPEC prices.
On May 9, long-held expectations of a call for an early election in the
United Kingdom, which is perceived as favorable for the Thatcher govern-
ment, were realized when Prime Minister Thatcher called for a June 9
election. Since then the pound has depreciated about one and one-half
percent.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Partial data for April indicate that foreign official reserve assets
in the United States declined during the month after increasing by $0.5
billion during the first quarter, as shown on line 4 of the Summary
Table of U.S. International Transactions.
On balance, G-10 holdings rose somewhat.
After falling $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 1983, OPEC
official reserve assets in the United States appeared on the basis of
partial data to decline further in April. These developments follow a
$6.6 billion increase in such OPEC holdings during 1982. The 1982
increase was about one-half of the $13.1 billion increase last year in
the sum of official and nonofficial OPEC assets in the United States;
the overall change consisted principally of increases in bank deposits
($4.4 billion) and Treasury bonds and notes ($6.9 billion). The rise in
OPEC assets in the United States last year occurred despite an estimated
$10 billion OPEC current account deficit and was accompanied by substantial
declines in OPEC assets in other parts of the world. According to Bank
of England estimates, OPEC holdings of Eurocurrency deposits, together
with domestic-currency deposits outside the United States, decreased by
about $21 billion. Although the OPEC countries continued in 1982 to make
investments outside the banking area in industrial countries abroad ($5.7
billion) and to make loans to developing countries ($3.9 billion), both

IV-5
of these types of transactions were much smaller than in 1981, when the
OPEC surplus was still large. The remaining types of OPEC assets,
largely unidentified, were reduced in 1982 by a total of around $12
billion. Staff estimates for 1983 show the OPEC current account deficit
widening to $34 billion.
U.S. official reserve assets (excluding foreign currencies held in
anticipation of repayments of Carter bonds) rose further during the
first quarter, but not by as much as in the preceding quarters. As
indicated in the table following, the increase in the U.S. reserve
position in the IMF, which resulted from the International Monetary
Fund's use of dollars during February and March, was partially offset
by repayments to the United States on the short-term programs of
bridging finance extended directly to certain developing countries
late last year and early in 1983. The April pause in the increase of
U.S. official reserve assets is not likely to persist, since future
drawings by developing countries on current or prospective IMF programs
will doubtlessly be financed at least partly in dollars.
Regarding transactions involving private securities, lines 2(b)
and (c) of the Summary Table show that the substantial net flow of funds
from U.S. residents into foreign securities that occurred during the
last half of 1982 abated considerably during the first three months of
1983, while foreign residents again stepped up sharply their volume of
net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks as equity prices in markets
here advanced during the first-quarter.
As shown in the International Banking Data table, there have been
no significant shifts in U.S. banking offices' positions vis-a-vis

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In March, the merchandise trade deficit was about the same as
recorded in the previous three months. Both exports and imports were up
somewhat from February levels.
For the first quarter as a whole, the trade deficit was $15
billion annual rate smaller than in the fourth quarter. Much of the
swing appears to be attributable to temporary factors, especially related
to oil imports.
Oil imports dropped dramatically in the first quarter from fourth
quarter levels -- by 30 percent in volume and by about $1.55 per barrel
in price (see the table on the next page) -- in response to several
largely temporary circumstances. U.S. oil consumption was lower than
expected reflecting a warmer-than-usual winter. Petroleum inventories

were drawn down, particularly in March, in anticipation of reduced OPEC
prices and because of a desire to reduce inventory-to-sales ratios.
In addition, during most of 4Q82 and 1Q83 there was increasing uncer-
tainty regarding world oil pricing and production policies; between
November 1982 and March 1983 spot oil prices dropped $5.00 per barrel. In
mid-February, in an effort to expand sales, Britain, Norway, and Nigeria
cut their official oil prices by $3 to $5.50 per barrel. In mid-March,
after almost two weeks of emergency talks, OPEC reached a formal agree-
ment on a $29 per barrel marker price for Saudi Arabianlight and a 17.5
mbd OPEC output ceiling. Mexico lowered its prices to be in line with
OPEC prices and in late March North Sea oil prices were lowered in
order to match Nigeriancrude (a similar quality of oil.) Since then
spot oil prices firmed during April to be at or near official levels;
during the past two weeks, however, spot prices have declined somewhat.

Nonoil imports were significantly higher in the first quarter than
in the fourth quarter, returning to import levels recorded in the second
and third quarters of last year. Items that declined sharply in 4Q82,
partly in response to the strong drawdown in business inventories at
that time, for the most part increased in 1Q83. Virtually all of the
swing was in volume. Nonoil import prices declined marginally in the

IV-11
first quarter; small price declines have been recorded each quarter for
the past year reflecting in part the current and lagged effects of the apprecia-
tion of the weighted average value of the U.S. dollar that occurred through the
fourth quarter of last year. The value of automotive products from
Japan and Europe increased by nearly 10 percent in the first quarter,
and, unlike in the case of aggregate nonoil imports, much of the auto-
motive increase was a result of higher prices. Part of the automotive
price rise resulted from a 9 percent dollar depreciation (1Q83/4Q82)
against the Japanese yen and a 4 percent depreciation against the German
mark that occurred largely during the fourth quarter of 1982; Japan
accounts for two-thirds of U.S. automotive imports other than from
Canada and Germany accounts for another 15-20 percent. About half of
the increase in value was in passenger cars and half in trucks and parts.
Shipments of cars from Japan to the United States have followed closely
the U.S.-Japan automotive agreement; the agreement-year ended March 31
with the agreed upon 1.68 million units being shipped to the United
States. Stocks of new foreign cars continued to be very low through
March.
Agricultural exports increased by 8 percent in volume in the
first quarter from the low levels recorded in the third and fourth
quarters of last year. Much of the rise was increased wheat shipments
to the U.S.S.R. and China under contracts signed in December. Export
prices increased in the first quarter. For corn and soybeans the rise
followed two years of price declines; wheat prices began to increase in
the fourth quarter. Prices rose as U.S. grain production moved into
inventories (primarily CCC purchases), as demand for wheat by the U.S.S.R.

IV-12
and China increased sharply in December and January, and as world demand
for U.S. soybeans increased because of limited supplies available from
Argentina and Brazil. Most recently, agricultural prices rose because
of extensive farmer participation in the Payments-in-Kind program.
The increase in nonagricultural exports in the first quarter was
more than accounted for by sharp increases in commercial aircraft exports
(largely to developed countries) and in automotive exports to Canada
(from an unusually low 4Q82 rate); these items account for 10 percent of
U.S. nonagricultural exports. Machinery exports (one-third of all non-
agricultural exports) declined for the second consecutive quarter; the
volume declined by 18 percent since the third quarter of 1982 as a
result of sluggish economic activity in major foreign markets and the
continued strong exchange value of the dollar.

IV -13
Foreign economic developments. Although it is too soon to declare
the 1982 recession over for foreign industrial countries, early signs of
recovery are emerging in several countries. German real GNP (s.a.) grew
at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the first quarter, according to
preliminary information. Industrial production so far this year has
increased significantly in Canada and France, and less sharply in
Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. Italian industrial production
fell in the first quarter. Surveys in Canada, Germany, and the United
Kingdom indicate positive developments. A French survey, taken soon
after the announcement of the austerity package, reveals a deterioration
in production prospects.
Inflation continued to moderate in the first quarter of this year
in all major foreign countries except France, where tight price controls
in the last half of 1982 have distorted the pattern.
Early data suggest that only France and Japan will have significant
imbalances in trade this year; the French deficit will be big and the
Japanese surplus will be large.
New budgets were passed in Japan and Canada in April. Both budgets
may provide mild stimulus to the economy through the timing of
expenditure or taxes; public-works expenditures are to be "front loaded"
in both countries, and taxes are to be "back loaded" in Canada. In late
March, France initiated a fairly stern austerity package which includes
tighter fiscal policy, tighter monetary policy, and restricted foreign
expenditures by French tourists. Both Italy and the United Kingom have
announced elections for June.

IV -14
Individual country notes. German industrial production was unchanged
between February and March. The first-quarter average was about 1
percent above the previous quarter's level, but still 6 percent below a
year ago. The rate of unemployment rose to 9.3 percent (s.a.) in April,
with 2.3 million unemployed. The most encouraging indicators to date
besides the above mentioned first-quarter GNP estimate are business cli-
mate surveys, which have been showing strong gains for several months.
The rate of consumer price inflation for the first four months of
this year at an annual rate was 1.2 percent, compared to 5.4 percent in
the first four months a year ago. The seasonally adjusted consumer price
index declined in each month of the first quarter -- an unprecedented
development even for Germany. One of the contributing factors in the
inflation picture has been the decline of import prices, which in March
were 3 percent below their year-earlier level. This year's wages round
is nearly completed, with an average wage increase of about 3 percent.
The current account for the first quarter of this year showed a
surplus of $1.6 billion, compared with a $0.4 billion deficit for the
same period of last year.
Fiscal policy remains tight, as the government seeks to carry out
its pledge to control the budget. Recent decisions make it appear
plausible that there will be a slight decline in real government spending
this year. Monetary policy, on the other hand, has continued to ease
with the most recent reduction in official interest rates occurring in
March. The growth of Central Bank Money in the first quarter was over 10
percent compared with the 7 percent upper target limit. CBM growth
slowed in April, but still remains significantly above target.

IV -15
Despite some gains in March, economic activity in Japan is still
quite sluggish, and pressure for a discount-rate reduction has
intensified as the yen has showed signs of strengthening. Industrial
production recovered sharply in March by 1-1/4 percent (s.a.) from
February's very low level, but growth in the index for the quarter was
only 0.1 percent (s.a.a.r.). Industrial production is still about 1
percent below its year-earlier level. Unemployment declined in March
from the record levels reached in January and February, but still was
extremely high by Japanese standards. Recent surveys by the Bank of
Japan and the Economic Planning Agency are cautiously optimistic about
the progress of the current recovery. Some strengthening of exports and
adjustment of inventories are bright spots, but other surveys suggest
that corporate investment in plant and equipment is likely to remain
weak.
Price and wage developments have continued to be very favorable.
The CPI rose slightly in April, but was still only 2 percent above its
year-previous level. Wholesale prices have declined in recent months;
the April WPI was about 3 percent below the fourth-quarter level. A
preliminary survey of settlements in the current spring wage-negotiation
round indicates that average wage settlements will be considerably below
the 7 percent increase of 1982.
Further strengthening of the trade and current account positions in
March has added some urgency to the need for a timely recovery. The
trade balance in March was $2.2 billion (s.a.), the largest monthly
figure since autumn 1981. The current account surplus was $1.3 billion
(s.a.), bringing the surplus for the first quarter to almost $3.5

IV -16
billion -- about half that for all of 1982.
Concern over expanding the already large government deficits of
recent years has limited spending in the FY 1983 budget (which received
final approval in early April and is effective from April 1) to a 1-1/2
percent nominal increase over that of the previous year. As part of a
package of measures designed to stimulate the economy, more than 75
percent of government expenditure is targeted for the first half of the
year.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has called for a general election
in the United Kingdom on June 9. The election has been called at a time
of recovery from the recent recession. Industrial production rose by 1.4
percent (s.a.) in the first quarter to a level 2.2 percent above its
average for the first quarter of 1982. Continued strength in retail
sales and a sharp increase in the rate of housing starts in the first
quarter confirm the expansion in the pace of economic activity.
Unemployment remains high, however; and in April was unchanged from the
March level of 13 percent. The rate of price inflation has greatly
decreased during the past year. In the first quarter of 1983, consumer
prices averaged 5 percent higher than their level in the first quarter of
1982; for that period the comparable figure was 11 percent. Wholesale
inflation has also improved. In April the wholesale price index was 7.3
percent above its year earlier level.
The U.K. current account balance registered a large surplus in
March, $0.8 billion, following a small surplus in February and a deficit
in January. The surplus resulted in part from a substantial increase in
exports that generated a trade surplus of $0.6 billion in March after

IV -17
deficits totalling $1 billion in January and February.
Through April, growth in the monetary aggregates averaged well
above the 7-11 percent target ranges announced in March. Nevertheless,
fiscal and monetary policies are following the basically restrained
course contained in the March budget and are likely to do so until the
election has been decided.
French economic activity grew irregularly in 1982 by over 1 percent
(Q4/Q4); growth in the fourth quarter was at an annual rate over 3
percent (s.a.). Industrial production in the first two months of 1983,
while showing recent strength, was at the same level as in the first two
months of 1982 and only marginally higher than in the final quarter of
1982. The April survey of industry reveals a recent weakening in
production and a strong deterioration in production prospects for the
next three months. Order books are weak, particularly for exports.
Inflation, as measured by the consumer and wholesale price indexes,
was in the 10-11 percent range (a.r.) in the first quarter of 1983.
These rates were well above the 6-7 percent range recorded in the last
half of 1982 when rigorous price controls were in effect, but were
marginally lower than the rates recorded in the first quarter of 1982.
However, in April consumer price inflation accelerated to nearly 1-1/2
percent.
Reflecting the relative strength of the French economy and the
overvalued franc, the first quarter trade deficit (s.a.) returned to the
$14 billion annual rate of 1982, reversing the temporary improvement in
the previous quarter.
The French franc was devalued late in March and an accompanying

IV -18
austerity package was announced. The M2 target for 1983 was reduced to 9
percent from a previous level of 10 percent and from an actual growth in
1982 of 12-1/2 percent. The fiscal measures included a forced loan to
the government, reduced expenditures, increased taxes, savings
incentives, and tigher exchange controls for French tourists. The
government expects these measures to reduce demand by about 2 percent of
GDP. The French have obtained a 4 billion ECU ($3.7) from the EEC "oil
facility." They have not been required to take any measures beyond those
taken after the devaluation.
The Italian economy continues to show no evidence of a recovery.
Industrial production in the first quarter was 1 percent below the level
of the previous quarter and 11 percent below the previous peak in 1980
Q1. Consumer surveys showed a slight improvement in January while
investment plans remain weak. Inflation, as measured by the rate of
change in consumer prices, decelerated somewhat in recent months. In the
three months ending in April, consumer prices rose by under 15 percent
(a.r.) over the level of the previous 3 months, after an average increase
of 16-1/2 percent in 1982. Wholesale prices in the 12 months ending in
March were up by 10-1/4 percent, compared with a 15-3/4 percent rise in
the year ending in March 1982.
The trade account continues to reflect the weakness of the Italian
economy. In the first quarter of this year, the deficit was $1.5
billion, compared with a $6.2 billion deficit in the same period of
1982.
On May 2, the Italian Banking Association reduced its prime rate by
0.75 percentage points to 18.75 percent. Long-term interest rates on

IV -19
average have declined by about 2 percentage points to about 17-1/2
percent since the beginning of this year.
The caretaker government headed by Prime Minister Fanfani announced
on May 5 a general election to coincide with local elections on June 26.
The election was necessitated by the Socialist party's withdrawal of
support from the four-party coalition. The Socialists, who won about 10
percent of the vote in the 1979 election, are expected to win more seats
and favor a less austere fiscal policy. The enlarged public sector
deficit last year was about 15-1/2 percent of GDP and is likely to remain
about the same this year.
Signs continue to appear suggesting that the deepest and most
protracted Canadian recession since the 1930s is over. A turnaround,
which first became evident in residential construction toward the end of
1982, now appears to be more general. In January industrial production
rose 5-3/4 percent, one of the largest monthly gains ever recorded. This
was followed by a further 1-3/4 percent increase in February. Output
remains weak, however, with industrial production still more than 13
percent below its most recent peak, reached in June 1981. The
unemployment rate, after declining 1/4 percentage point in January, has
been unchanged through April at around 12-1/2 percent. Recent consumer
and business surveys indicate that the outlook has become more
optimistic.
The inflation picture continues to improve. In March, the year-
over-year rate of increase in the CPI fell to 7-1/4 percent, the tenth
consecutive improvement since peaking last May at almost 12 percent. On
the same basis, the industry selling price index rose by less than 4

percent during the first quarter. The trade balance in the first quarter
continued in surplus at a rate not far below the record pace of 1982.
On April 19, the government of Canada announced a budget containing
C$4.8 billion of additional expenditures over the next four years. This
includes C$2-1/4 billion for government capital projects, the bulk of it
moved forward from the second half of the decade, and a like amount to
fund private investment incentives. Additional sums have been allocated
to direct spending on employment, housing, and aid to exports, farmers,
small business and fishing. To finance the new spending, federal sales
taxes will be increased, but on a delayed basis. As a result, the budget
deficit is projected by the government to rise by about 1/2 percent of
GNP in FY 1983 and by about one-third that amount again the following
year. By FY 1985 and 1986, the deficit is projected to be smaller than
it would have been without the budget measures.
Update on Major Debt Problem Situations in Developing Countries
The four Latin American countries that started IMF programs in late
1982 and early 1983 as part of major debt refinancing and adjustment
efforts have had mixed success in complying with program performance tar-
gets. Argentina and Mexico are expected to pass first-quarter tests.
Chile and, likely, Brazil will not be able to draw further from the IMF
without a waiver. Venezuela has suspended payments on the principal of
its $13 billion in public sector external debt coming due in 1983. Banks
want Venezuela to go to the IMF as a precondition to a rescheduling.
According to preliminary indications, Mexico is in compliance with
the first-quarter performance tests of the Extended Fund Facility
arrangement with the IMF. Public expenditures were cut drastically in

IV -24
the first quarter by the new administration which assumed office in
December. Hence, even though public sector revenues in the first quarter
were less than expected (mainly because of the low rate of economic
activity), the public sector deficit was sharply lower. Organized labor
began to press for a raise in April, ahead of the scheduled mid-year
review of wages, as the 30 percent rise in the CPI since January had
outstripped the 25 percent minimum wage increase granted in January.
However, President de la Madrid announced early in May that there would
not be any increase before mid-year.
In March, Mexico signed a $5 billion loan agreement with foreign
commercial banks and began negotiations to restructure about $20 billion
in public sector debts to foreign banks. Mexico also has introduced
several plans to deal with components of its private debt:
-- capitalization and conversion to public sector debt of the
private sector interest payments due to foreign banks and
accruing between August 1, 1982 and January 31, 1983. Mexico
made payments of $60 million in February and $37 million in
April under this plan. About $750 million in overdue interest
potentially eligible for the plan has qualified so far out of an
expected total of about $900 million.
-- promotion of a restructuring of private sector external debts on
terms parallel to those of the proposed restructuring of the
public sector.
-- discussions are under way regarding the treatment of private
debts owed to or guaranteed by official institutions in
the creditor countries.
The depressed level of economic activity, the sharp depreciation of
the peso in 1982, and the severe shortage of foreign exchange are con-
tinuing to hold imports well below year earlier levels, while non-oil
exports are expanding moderately. The loss in oil export earnings
because of the drop in oil prices amounts to $1.0-$1.5 billion over a

IV -25
full year. However, Mexico will save about the same amount in interest
payments on its external debt as a result of the substantial decline in
world interest rates since last July.
Brazil's trade surplus for March exceeded $500 million and exceeded
$600 million in April, after a combined January-February total of only
$330 million. Staff analyses indicate that Brazil's targets, under its
IMF program, of a trade surplus of $6 billion and current account deficit
of $7 billion are attainable.
Brazil's recent problems instead appear to be coming primarily from
the capital account. Specifically, there has been attrition on interbank
lines. These lines reached a 1983 peak of $7.1 billion (including over-
night deposits) in early March as compared with $8.6 billion at end-June,
1982. However, as of late April, total interbank deposits stood at less
than $6 billion. Staff estimates suggest that Brazil may need $1.5 to
$2.5 billion in additional loans this year even if Brazilian trade and
current account targets are reached.
Brazil is scheduled to make itsnext drawing of SDR 374 million
under its three-year SDR 4.5 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility program
on May 31. Brazil's drawings of new money from the banks depend on
Brazil being in compliance with IMF conditions.
Although Argentina claims to have met the first quarter performance
criteria under its 15-month SDR 1.5 billion IMF standby arrangement,
recent trends in policy implementation, including the announcement of
price controls and credit subsidies and lags in reducing payments arrears,
are raising doubts about whether performance criteria beyond the first
quarter will be met. Argentina has been negotiating with banks for

IV -26
several months over the refinancing of debt coming due in 1983. An agree-
ment in principle on refinancing about $5 billion in public or publicly-
guaranteed debt was reached several months ago but has not been imple-
mented because of various disagreements, including differences over the
interest rate to be charged. An Argentinian scheme to reschedule about
$4 billion in private sector bank debt covered by government exchange
insurance contracts has not yet been accepted by banks. In addition, a
medium-term bank loan to Argentina for $1.5 billion, which has been under
negotiation for several months, has not yet been signed, although an
agreement is again reported to be near.
Venezuela has abandoned its earlier loan-by-loan approach to
refinancing its large short-term state agency external debt and has
declared a moratorium, through July 1, on repayments of principal on
public sector debt. The Venezuelans claim they have remained current on
public sector external interest payments, but there are some reports from
banks of interest payment arrears on this debt. Arrears are also build-
ing up on repayments of Venezuelan private sector external debt. Dis-
cussions are underway with international banks on the rescheduling of $13
billion of debt that comes due in 1983. Banks reportedly want the
Venezuelans to have an IMF program in place as a precondition for bank
debt rescheduling. The Venezuelan authorities, however, would like to
delay an approach to the IMF until after the presidential elections
scheduled for December of this year. They fear that the likely IMF
conditions, including a further devaluation and a rapid return to a
unified exchange rate, higher taxes and petroleum prices, and further
government spending cuts, would be politically unpopular.

IV -27
The Chilean authorities have proposed to the international finan-
cial community a financial package which includes both new financing and
a restructuring of Chile's $14 billion external debt. On April 29 Chile
telexed this plan, which has the approval of its 12-bank advisory
committee, to its foreign bank creditors. The plan calls for:
-$1.3 billion in new loans, repayable over seven years,
including four years grace;
-rescheduling over eight years, with four years grace, of $1.1
billion of medium- and long-term principal payments, $1.3 billion
of short-term working capital from foreign banks falling due in
February-December 1983, and an additional $1 billion falling due
in 1984; and,
-maintenance of short-term trade credits at the end January level
of about $1.2 billion.
The cooperation of Chile's foreign creditors in implementing this plan
is crucial to Chile's efforts to return to the IMF stand-by path by
September 30, 1983. Chile fell out of compliance with its IMF program
soon after its approval early this year because of the abrupt cessation
of external capital inflows following the Chilean banking crisis in
January. Chile has also been attempting to raise $400-500 million in
bridge financing from private banks and the BIS as a basis for requesting
a waiver of its end-March performance criteria. The proposed waiver
would allow Chile to resume drawings from the IMF in July.
