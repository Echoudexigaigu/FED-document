The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The expansion in economic activity accelerated in the second quarter
as industrial production and employment increased rapidly in April and May.
Consumer expenditures rose substantially, led by gains in auto sales.
Business spending for capital equipment also continued to strengthen as
firms began to rebuild inventories. Although a turnaround in energy
prices has boosted recent measures of inflation, price increases outside
the energy area have continued to slow.
Industrial Production
Industrial production rose 1.1 percent in May, the sixth consecutive
monthly increase, to a level 7 percent above the November trough. Gains
over the past half year have been widespread, with particularly large
advances occurring in durable consumer goods, construction supplies, and
durable materials. Reflecting the growth in production, both manufacturing
and materials capacity utilization rates increased to a revised level
of about 73-1/2 percent in May. (See Appendix A for a description of the
forthcoming revision to capacity utilization.)
Among consumer goods, auto assemblies climbed 5 percent in May to
a 6.2 million unit annual rate, and preliminary data indicate an increase
to a 6.9 million unit pace in June. Production of lightweight trucks
for consumer use and of home goods such as appliances, carpeting, and
furniture also has risen substantially in recent months. In addition,
output of business equipment, which reached a trough in February, was
up sharply in both April and May.
Growth in materials output, which had been an important stimulus
to overall production in recent months, slowed somewhat in May. This is

a typical pattern in a recovery period; in the early months, gains in
materials tend to exceed growth in intermediate and final products
as manufacturers stop liquidating or start replenishing low stocks.
Employment and Unemployment
The demand for labor has strengthened further recently. During
the first quarter, gains in production were achieved mainly through
cyclical productivity growth and increases in the workweek. However, in
April and May payroll employment gains were both large and widespread,
with about 70 percent of the industries surveyed in May reporting increases
compared with 55 percent in the first quarter. Gains were especially
large in the services, durable goods manufacturing, and construction
industries. In addition, the length of the factory workweek has increased
about 2-1/2 percent since December, a considerably stronger advance than
in previous recoveries.
Unemployment has continued to decline along with the expansion in
economic activity. By May the civilian unemployment rate, at 10.1 percent,
was 0.7 percentage point below the December peak. Most of this decline
in joblessness occurred among white adult men and women, while unemployment
rates for black workers remained near their recession highs. Since the
mid-May reference week for the employment surveys, initial claims for
unemployment insurance have fallen sharply. In the week ended June 18,
new claims totaled about 400,000, the lowest figure since the summer of
1981.
Personal Income and Consumption
Reflecting the greater strength in labor demand, income growth has
increased in recent months. Personal income rose 1.2 percent in May,

the largest monthly advance since the beginning of the recovery, with
much of the gain in the wage and salary component. With outlays for
personal consumption rising rapidly in April and May, the personal saving
rate dropped to an average of 5-1/2 percent for the first two months of
the second quarter--down from 5.9 percent in the first quarter.
Retail sales rose 2.1 percent in May following similar advances
in March and April. Sharp increases in auto sales have been an important
factor in the recent gains. During the last 10 days of May and the
first 20 days of June, domestic automobiles sold at a 7.3 million unit
annual rate, the strongest pace over any 30-day period since the summer
of 1981. Purchases of large cars have increased in recent months, and
interest rate concessions have been instrumental in boosting sales of
small cars. Despite relatively low stocks of Japanese cars, sales of
foreign units also increased in May to a 2.2 million unit rate.
Spending for consumer goods other than autos and gasoline rose 1.2
percent in May and was almost 2 percent above the first-quarter average.
Gains were widespread: outlays for general merchandise increased 3.5
percent following several months of sluggish sales, while sales of furniture
and appliances continued the upsurge evident since late last year.
The vigorous gains in consumer spending in May accompanied reports
of sharply improved consumer confidence in both the Conference Board and
Michigan Surveys. The Michigan survey also indicated an increase in the
percentage of respondents believing that conditions are favorable
for buying new cars, homes, and large consumer durables.
In addition, survey data indicate that inflation expectations are
still relatively low, remaining below 5 percent so far this year compared
with an average of 7.2 percent in 1981 and 5.7 percent in 1982.

Housing Markets
The strong performance of the housing sector continued in May, as
total private housing starts rose to a 1.79 million unit annual rate.
Since the turn of the year, starts have exhibited sizable month-to-month
swings, probably reflecting unusual weather conditions in many parts of
the country; on balance, however, starts in April and May were 30 percent
above the level in the last quarter of 1982. The generally less volatile
series of newly issued residential permits has trended upward fairly
steadily since last autumn, and also stands about 30 percent above its
level in the fourth quarter of last year.
Both single- and multifamily starts rose in May. Multifamily starts
climbed to a 640,000 unit annual rate and have averaged close to a 600,000
unit rate during the first five months of 1983, about 50 percent above
the average for 1982. Most of the recent strength in multifamily activity
apparently has been in the unsubsidized rental sector. The Section 8
program of federal rent subsidies has been all but discontinued, while
starts of condominium and co-op units fell to 30 percent of total multi-
family starts in the first quarter of 1983, compared with 40 percent
in late 1981. Single-family starts rose 14 percent in May, to a level
120 percent above their low point in 1981, and new house sales, at a
650,000 annual rate, were up 80 percent from their quarterly low last
year. Inventories of unsold new units, which were reduced drastically
during the recent downturn, have trended up slightly, but remain low
relative to sales.

following a first-quarter gain in real terms of nearly 4 percent at an
annual rate. This strength has been confined to equipment spending.
Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and parts were
4 percent above the first-quarter average in May, with sizable increases
in both electrical and nonelectrical machinery. In addition, spending
for motor vehicles, which picked up in the first quarter, has continued
at a strong pace.
The recent behavior of new orders for nondefense capital goods
signals further improvement of activity in coming months. Orders
excluding aircraft and parts jumped almost 10 percent in March and were
another 2-1/2 percent higher, on average, in April and May. Several
fundamental determinants of business spending also have become more
favorable in recent months. Business output, generally considered to be
among the strongest influences on equipment spending, grew appreciably
over the first half of the year, and the cash flow of firms has improved.
Although capacity utilization rates remain low, they have been trending
upward since February.
In contrast, the cyclical contraction in nonresidential structures
is continuing. Construction spending was about 4 percent lower, on
average, in April and May, than in the first quarter. The recent decline
has been particularly sharp in the commercial and industrial building
component, as both office and industrial vacancy rates remain high.
The most recent Commerce Department survey of plant and equipment
spending plans showed a decline of 3.4 percent in nominal terms for 1983
compared with 1982. Much of the weakness was in reported first-quarter
spending expenditures are expected to rise by about 9 percent over the
remainder of the year.

Inventories
The business inventory correction in the current cycle appears to
be ending. Inventories were liquidated at a record pace late in 1982
and early this year, and are now at a comfortable level in most industries,
even after rising in some sectors in April and May.
In manufacturing, the book value of inventories rose at a $12 billion
annual rate in May, after edging up in April. These increases followed
five consecutive quarterly declines. Total manufacturers shipments have
been trending up since last October, and jumped 2-3/4 percent in May;
as a result, the stock-sales ratio fell to 1.54, its lowest level in
four years.
By the end of May, stocks of new domestic autos at dealers had fallen
to a 51 day supply, quite low on a historical basis. Because June sales
have so far been running ahead of assemblies, stocks have probably dipped
even further.
Federal Government
The federal government deficit was a record $29.3 billion (not at
an annual rate) in May. The deficit has been unusually large in recent
months--after adjusting for seasonal patterns--due primarily to low net
corporate income taxes, and small net settlements on individual income
taxes in the recent annual tax return period. For both types of taxpayers,
refunds have been large recently. In the case of corporations, this
reflected carrybacks. For individuals, it partly reflected slow IRS
processing of early returns, which resulted in a concentration of refunds
in May.

Outlays in April and May declined slightly. A major factor in the
expenditure reduction has been the relatively low spending in the last
few months by the Commodity Credit Corporation, following record outlays
with fall and winter. Unemployment outlays, in contrast, rose in
April and May due to new federal supplemental benefits for the long-term
unemployed. Net interest expenditures also increased in May; interest
outlays had remained relatively stable during the first half of the
fiscal year as the effects of declining interest rates offset the effects
of the rising deficits.
Congress passed the First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for
Fiscal Year 1984 on June 23. The resolution implies a deficit of between
$170 billion and $179 billion in FY1984, with the exact amount depending
on the size of the Congressional authorization for recession relief
programs. More detail on the resolution is provided in appendix B.
State and Local Government
Activity in the state and local government sector has shown little
change in the last several months. Real compensation, the largest com-
ponent of purchases, was unchanged in the first quarter, and appears to
have grown only slightly in the second quarter. Stability in employment
has now persisted for about a year, suggesting that the slow decline
that begain in late 1980 has ended.
However, construction activity for the year to date continues to be
weak. The average value of new construction spending in April and May
was approximately 5 percent below the first quarter level, which in
turn was down 5.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 1982. As the year
progresses, this downward movement may be reversed because of increased

II-17
federal highway aid, favorable construction costs, and some easing of
state and local fiscal conditions accompanying the economic recovery.
The Farm Sector
In contrast to the upturn in the general economy, output in the farm
sector is falling this year. On a value-added basis, real farm output in
the first half of 1983 is estimated to have been down about 8 percent
from its exceptionally high fourth-quarter level. Further output declines
are expected in the second half, owing to government programs that have
resulted in reduced plantings of a number of crops.
The accumulation of farm inventories, including CCC stocks, slowed
toward mid-1983. Preliminary indications are that the stocks owned or
financed by the government's Commodity Credit Corporation declined mod-
erately in the second quarter, following a rapid buildup during the two
preceding quarters. A more rapid liquidation of CCC inventories appears
likely in the second half of the year, when these stocks will be returned
to farmers as payment-in-kind (PIK) subsidies for idling cropland. The
net reduction in CCC stocks, however, may be less than the PIK trans-
fer, because of government purchases of this year's crops under the
regular CCC program.1
The financial situation in farming appears to have steadied. Farm
proprietors' income for the first five months of 1983 averaged about
1. Government programs to reduce crop production in the current year will
act as a drag on real output growth. However, the PIK transfer itself
will have no effect on GNP, because it consists of goods already produced.
Owing to an accounting convention, the transfer will be recorded as a
negative government purchase at the time the transfer is made. The
transfer will thus tend to depress final sales, but this will be offset
by an equivalent rise in farm product inventories.

II-18
$19 billion at an annual rate--still low, but up from a year earlier.
Land prices in some farming regions turned up early this year, after
steep declines in 1981 and 1982. Reports of financial stress seem to
have diminished.
Farm product prices rose through the early part of 1983, the result
both of bad weather and of the government's programs to reduce production
and isolate crop inventories from the marketplace. Toward mid-year,
however, prices began weakening in spot markets, and futures prices have
declined as well.
Wages
Wage inflation moderated somewhat further on average during the
first five months of 1983. The often-volatile hourly earnings index
rose 0.5 percent in May, after registering very small increases during
the previous two months. Despite the May increase, the index has risen
at only a 4.5 percent annual rate so far this year, compared with a 6
percent increase in 1982. Wage increases have been especially moderate
in the high unemployment sectors, manufacturing and construction, averaging
just 2 to 3 percent at an annual rate. In part, this slow growth reflected
concessions by union workers. The incidence of wage freezes and pay
cuts in new union settlements appeared to remain about as great in the
second quarter as during the preceding year. However, bargaining in the
second half will be concentrated in industries such as telephone and
aerospace where concessions seem less likely.
Wage inflation also has slowed outside of the industrial sector.
For example, the hourly earnings index for the services industry has
increased at a 5-1/4 percent annual rate this year, down from 6-3/4

percent in 1982. Wage adjustments in the large trade sector, which
appear to be quite sensitive to high unemployment, declined substantially
early in the recession and have stayed close to 5 percent over the past
year and a half.
Prices
Consumer prices rose at a 6-3/4 percent annual rate in April and
May, after showing little change in the first quarter. However, much of
the increase can be attributed to recent developments in energy markets,
as inflation rates continued to moderate in other sectors. Excluding
food and energy items, the CPI increased at an annual rate under 4 percent
in April and May, somewhat less than the first-quarter pace and well
below the 6 percent rate last year. Except for a few categories, notably
used cars, the slowing this year has been widespread in both commodities
and services.
Gasoline price hikes were the major factor in the recent rapid
rise in consumer energy prices, increasing by about 4 percent (not an
annual rate) in both April and May. About half of the rise was due to
the passthrough of the five-cent per gallon federal excise tax imposed
in April. According to recent survey data, however, retail gasoline price
increases have slowed markedly since May.
Inflation in the food sector appears to be easing after a temporary
spurt that was mainly weather-related. In May, the CPI food component
rose at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate despite another large increase in
prices of fresh fruits and vegetables, which have been less plentiful
this spring owing to wet weather. At the farm level, prices turned down
in May and, on net, futures prices for most crop and livestock products
have declined in recent weeks.

APPENDIX A*
REVISION OF CAPACITY UTILIZATION
The Federal Reserve's capacity indexes and capacity utilization
rates for manufacturing and materials have been revised. The results
of the revision are to be published on July 18, 1983, together with
the new monthly estimate for June and are confidential until that
release. All component series have been re-estimated from 1967 to the
present, and estimates of capacity growth since 1979 generally have been
lowered. Apart from the needs for periodic revisions of the capacity
series, this revision was prompted by the concern that during the period
of prolonged economic stagnation since early 1979, capacity growth may
have been slower than previously estimated and even may have declined
for some industries. Over the 1979-82 period, manufacturing capacity
growth has been reduced from an annual rate of 3.0 percent to 2.4 per-
cent, and materials capacity growth lowered from a 2.5 percent annual
rate to 2.0 percent. In accordance with the lower capacity estimates,
manufacturing and materials operating rates were revised upward: the
December 1982 operating rate for manufacturing became 68.9 percent rather
than 67.5 percent, and for materials the rate was raised from 65.2 per-
cent to 66.6 percent. Even though the revised estimates have resulted
in only moderately higher aggregate manufacturing and materials utiliza-
tion rates, capacity estimates and utilization rates for some industries
have been changed more substantially.
Over the 1979-82 period capacity growth has become negative for the
petroleum refining and the motor vehicles and parts industries, and a
large capacity shrinkage occurred in the iron and steel industry. For
several industries--fabricated metals, machinery, aerospace, and stone,
clay and glass--estimated capacity growth since 1979 remains positive
but has been cut back considerably relative to previous estimates. For
textiles and nonferrous metals earlier estimates of capacity growth
already were low over this period, and the new estimates are still lower--
under 0.5 percent per year. In rubber and plastics the review of
capacity growth has substantiated the earlier estimates of a sharp
deceleration of capacity. Only for the food industry was capacity growth
since 1979 revised up.
Various industry and survey sources were used to derive these
estimates. As before, we made extensive use of the McGraw-Hill capacity
and capacity utilization survey; the latest was for 1982.
The attached table contains revised and previous data on capacity
growth and utilization rates.

FIRST CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE EUDGET--FISCAL YEAR 1984
Overview
The Congress adopted the first FY1984 budget resolution on June 23.
The resolution establishes congressional tax, spending, and deficit tar-
gets for the next three fiscal years and revises the limits that were
previously set for FY1983. As Table 1 shows, the Congressional plan
calls for a deficit which drops from $203 billion in FY1983 to $127 bil-
lion in FY1986. These deficit targets may be increased, however--by as
much as $9 billion in FY1984--if legislation authorizing programs included
in a special anti-recession reserve fund is enacted.
The Congressional budget sets spending priorities that differ from
those proposed by the Administration last February by slowing the growth
of defense spending advocated by the Administration and rejecting most of
the nondefense cuts that were proposed in the Administration's budget.
Congress does call for small cuts in some entitlement programs but these
are about offset by small increases in other nondefense programs. In
addition, the reserve fund provides for anti-recession programs that are
not included in Administration budget plans. Finally, the Congressional
budget calls for larger tax increases than the Administration.
Congressional Baseline and Economic Assumptions
In its budget deliberations, Congress gauges its actions against a
baseline projection of the revenues and outlays that would occur if cur-
rent laws and policies were to continue unchanged. The baseline deficit
used for the Congressional budget is shown in line (d) of Table 2. It is
derived from the January estimate by the Congressional Budget Office of
program costs and tax receipts under current policy. These estimates
(shown in line (a)) were adjusted for subsequently enacted legislation
(primarily the Social Security Amendments and Jobs bill), technical
reestimates based on incoming spending and tax patterns, and revised
economic assumptions.
The new economic assumptions show a higher rate of growth of real
GNP during 1983, bringing the projection more into line with the recent
concensus of forecasts, and corresponding adjustments were made to the
unemployment projection. Interest rates were adjusted to allow for the
actual rates that have been recorded since January. Although the recovery
now being assumed by Congress is stronger than that projected by the
Administration in its April budget update, it has been reported that the
Administration will assume even higher near-term real growth in its July
mid-session budget review. The economic projections adopted by Congress
are compared to earlier CBO and Administration projections in Table 3.

of Research and Statistics.

II-B-2
Congressional Budget Initiatives
The budget resolution proposes significant reductions in the
baseline deficit by cutting defense and increasing taxes (see Table 2).
The anti-recession reserve would increase the deficit. Other nondefense
changes are small and, on balance, tend to leave nondefense spending at
about its baseline level.
The Congressional defense plan limits the growth of real budget
authority to five percent per year during the 1984 to 1986 period. This
limit results in cumulative savings, in the FY1984 to FY1986 period, of
$30 billion relative to previous congressional plans--due to the diffi-
culty of defining "current policy" defense spending the CBO took the
defense spending plan adopted in the FY1983 budget resulution as the
defense baseline--and a saving of $53 billion relative to the Administra-
tion's February budget proposal.
The resolution also calls on authorizing committees to save $12.3
billion over 3 years by cutting existing nondefense entitlement programs-
primarily medicare and federal retirement--and saves an additional $3.7
billion over this period by limiting federal civilian agency pay. These
savings are in large measure offset, however, by higher funding levels
for other nondefense entitlement programs (line (g) in Table 2 is the net
effect of initiatives) and increased domestic discretionary spending (line
(h) in Table 2). Resulting nondefense funding levels--excluding the anti-
recession fund--are slightly above baseline levels in FY1984 and FY1985
and slightly below in FY1986. The congressional spending levels are, how-
ever, substantially above Administration nondefense spending proposals
which had called for cuts of $14.8 billion in FY1984 and $37.8 billion in
FY1986.
A novel feature of the budget resolution is the segregation of new
anti-recession programs in a reserve fund (shown in line (f) of Table 2).
Spending ceilings will become effective to provide for these programs
only when they are specifically authorized in legislation enacted by
Congress. The reserve fund was established so that funds contemplated
for these programs would not become available for other domestic spending
if Congress fails to enact the authorizing legislation. Included in the
reserve fund are loan and mortgage foreclosure relief programs for home-
owners and farmers, a physical infrastructure program, jobs and training
programs for the long-term unemployed, a health insurance program for the
unemployed and extension of the federal supplemental unemployment compen-
sation program into FY1984. The reserve would allow as much as $19.3
billion in additional spending during the FY1983 to FY1986 period.
On the revenue side of the budget, the Congressional plan calls on
the tax writing committees of the House and Senate to propose changes in
tax law that will increase revenues by $12 billion in FY1984, $15 billion
in FY1985 and $46 billion in FY1986. Even larger tax increases would be
required if, as now appears almost certain, the dividend and interest
withholding scheduled to begin this summer is repealed. The revenue

II-B-3
increases proposed for FY1984 and FY1985 are substantially larger than
the $8.5 billion increase requested by the Administration for these two
years combined. The FY1986 increase is about the same as Administration
proposals including the contingency tax plan.
The Congressional budget plan is compared to the Administration's
April budget projections in Table 4.
Reconciliation and Enforcement
The resolution includes reconciliation instructions which call on
Senate and House authorizing committees to report to the Budget committees
program changes that will reduce outlays by $2.8 billion in FY1984, $3.9
billion in FY1985 and $5.5 billion in FY1986 (the entitlement savings
noted above). The tax increases called for in the budget resolution are
also covered by the reconciliation instructions which call on the affected
committees to report recommended changes by July 22. The changes covered
by the reconciliation instructions can then be packaged into a single
bill by the Budget committees.
As was the case last year, the first resolution will be automati-
cally converted to the second (binding) budget resolution if Congress
does not enact a second resolution by October 1, 1983. Enforcement is,
however, weaker than in last year's congressional budget in one important
respect. The FY1983 budget resolution provided that an appropriation
bill that exceeded total spending targets could not be sent to the Presi-
dent for signature before the second budget resolution had been adopted.
This provision, known as deferred enrollment, is not included in this
year's budget.
Monetary Policy
The resolution also contains language that requests House and Senate
Banking committees to report a resolution expressing the sense of the
Congress as to the coordination of fiscal and monetary policy--including
information regarding the economic assumptions and goals of the Federal
Reserve System and information about the effects of the Federal Reserve's
monetary policy on the economy.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The monetary aggregates continued to grow rapidly in June. M1 expan-
sion remained in double-digits, keeping the aggregate well above the FOMC's
1983 growth range. Expansion in M2 and M3 in June was just below the ad-
vanced May rate, and was strong enough to boost them to levels around the
upper ends of their long-run target ranges. Against this backdrop--and
with incoming data pointing to a stronger economy--interest rates, which
began to firm in early May, have moved up further since the last FOMC meet-
ing--in most cases by 1/2 to 3/4 of a percentage point.
In credit markets, the debt of nonfinancial sectors is estimated to
have grown at an annual rate of about 12 percent in June, somewhat faster
than on average in earlier months. The acceleration was attributable to
stepped-up federal government borrowing as the Treasury built its cash
balance in a month of a small budget surplus. For other sectors, overall
credit demands were moderate and tended to be focused somewhat less on
long-term markets than in recent months. Owing in part to the backup in
rates, bond offerings by both businesses and state and local governments
moderated significantly in June, while the total of business borrowing from
banks and in the commercial paper market increased for the first time in
four months. Consumer installment loan growth picked up a bit in April
from its first-quarter pace and partial data for May and June suggest a
further acceleration. Mortgage activity has remained strong, although per-
haps slowing somewhat recently from earlier in the year.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 growth continued strong in June, though well below the record pace
of May. For the second quarter as a whole, M1 growth slowed only moderately

III-3
from its rapid first-quarter pace, and from the fourth quarter of 1982
through June, M1 expanded at a 14-1/4 percent annual rate.
The strength in M1 in recent months has been evident in all of its
components. Growth in currency remained rapid throughout the second quar-
ter. Demand deposits--which had contracted on balance over the first four
months of the year--grew rapidly in May and June, reflecting in part slow-
ing of shifts to Super NOWs and MMDAs.
The pickup in the economy likely has given some impetus to M1 demand
in recent months.1 Growth of M1, however, was only a bit above that of
nominal GNP in the second quarter, and the decline in M1 velocity thus was
relatively small (see chart on page III-4). Nevertheless, the drop in M1
velocity in the early stages of a cyclical upturn is unprecedented during
the postwar period, at least in part reflecting the changing composition of
this aggregate.
M2 growth slackened only a little in June as the slowdown in M1 growth
was partially offset by an acceleration in the nontransactions component of
M2. The increase in M2 during the second quarter, at a 10-1/4 percent annu-
al rate, was only one half that for the first quarter largely because of
lessened shifting to money market deposit accounts. Growth of MMDAs con-
tinued to slow in recent months-indeed, a small outflow occurred in late
1. Growth of the narrow money stock in the second quarter was once again
faster than predicted by the Board's econometric models. However, accord-
ing to an experimental version of the quarterly model that includes OCDs
explicitly, the excess of actual over predicted growth was only about
2-1/2 percentage points at an annual rate. This excess is considerably
less than that of the standard version of the quarterly model, as the
experimental model suggests a greater impact in the second quarter of
previous interest rate declines and a further impact of the availability
of Super NOWS with market-determined yields. Both versions suggest that
stronger economic activity thus far in 1983 has boosted M1 growth a few
percentage points.

June--and for the second quarter as a whole shifts from outside M2 probably
boosted growth in this aggregate by 3 to 4 percentage points, compared with
roughly 10 percentage points in the first quarter. After making allowance
for the effects of these shifts, M2 appears to have increased somewhat less
than nominal income in the second quarter, possibly signaling a reduced
desire to hold liquid assets as the economic recovery strengthened. Rela-
tive to the February-March base period, M2 is estimated to have grown at
a 9-1/2 percent annual rate through June, near the top of its target range
of 7 to 10 percent.
The recent behavior of other components of M2 appears to reflect the
waning of the public's adjustment to MMDAs. Net outflows from general pur-
pose and broker/dealer money market mutual funds abated considerably during
the second quarter; savings deposits increased at a moderate rate in May
and June, and small time deposits turned upward in June. The overnight RP
component of M2 rose sharply in May, as RP collateral at commercial banks
was augmented by a surge in acquisitions of Treasury securities and a drop
in Treasury balances, but its growth slowed in June.
M3 growth in June about matched the rapid May pace. On a quarterly
average basis, however, it decelerated in the second quarter to an 8-1/4
percent annual rate. Since the fourth quarter of 1982, M3 has grown at a
9-3/4 percent annual rate, putting this aggregate just above its target
range of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent. Large time deposits at commercial banks,
which had declined earlier in the year as core deposits were enlarged by
MMDAs, increased in June. Thrift institutions continued to augment their
core deposits with large time deposits in June; meanwhile, advances from
FHLBs leveled off, after contracting over the previous three months.

III-7
Growth in total loans and investments at commercial banks in June
evidently nearly matched the strong May pace, leaving the expansion in
bank credit for the second quarter only a bit below that of the first quar-
ter. A drop in the rate of accumulation of U.S. Treasury securities in
June was offset by an acceleration in loan growth. Real estate loans picked
up--boosting their quarterly growth to its most rapid rate in two years--
and business lending strengthened considerably as well. Consumer loan
growth remained strong in June, although off a bit from May; the second-
quarter growth rate was the highest since the third quarter of 1979. The
pickup in business loans at commercial banks in June appears to have been
part of a rise in the demand for short- and intermediate-term credit,
largely reflecting a shifting of demands with the backup in long-term
interest rates. Commercial paper issuance by nonfinancial businesses also
increased in June, after a sharp contraction throughout the earlier part of
the year.
Business Finance
Nonfinancial corporations appear to have raised slightly more funds
in credit and equity markets in the second quarter than in the first. Al-
though the heavy inventory liquidation that occurred in the first quarter
appears to have ended, business financing needs still were fairly light,
as cash flow improved and fixed capital outlays rose only slightly. Equity
issuance has been strong, and corporate bond issuance proceeded at a rapid
pace in April and May before falling off in June when corporate bond rates
rose.
Since the last FOMC meeting, the Board's index of recently offered
corporate bond yields has risen 60 basis points, reaching 12.14 percent.

III-9
The yield spread between prime corporate bonds and 20-year Treasury secu-
rities has continued to fluctuate in a relatively narrow range of 70 to 80
basis points. As rates backed up in June, the quality spread between high-
and lower-rated corporate bonds widened somewhat from the narrow differen-
tials in April and May, but it is still quite low by historical standards.
The gross amount of publicly offered bonds sold in domestic markets
by all U.S. corporations totaled $7 billion in May, but volume has fallen
off sharply in recent weeks and is estimated to have been only about $1-3/4
billion in June. Nevertheless, the large volume of long-term corporate
debt issued in the quarter as a whole, and the accompanying net paydown of
business loans and commercial paper, indicate that firms made further pro-
gress towards lowering their short- to long-term debt ratio, despite the
increased emphasis on short-term borrowing in June.
The continued gain in stock prices has made equity issuance an attrac-
tive form of external financing for many firms. Reflecting the buoyant
stock market, price-earnings ratios (as conventionally measured, using the
past 12-month book profits) have reached their highest levels since 1976.
Corporations responded by selling $3 billion of new equity issues in May
and $5-1/4 billion in June. Stock issuance has played an unusually impor-
tant role in corporate funding during this cyclical upturn.
Government Finance
Federal sector. The Treasury borrowed $44-1/2 billion, net, in the
second quarter to finance a $33-1/2 billion deficit and to build up its cash
balance. Although the budget probably was marginally in surplus in June
owing to seasonal tax inflows, the Treasury raised about $23 billion of new
funds during the month in anticipation of substantial financing needs in the

third quarter. The Treasury cash balance is estimated by the staff to have
reached a very high level of $28 billion at the end of June.
Congressional delays in raising the debt ceiling disrupted Treasury
auctions in May. The statutory debt limit was raised $100 billion to $1.4
trillion in late May--likely sufficient to see the Treasury through the end
of September--and the Treasury subsequently raised $5 billion of new money
at auctions of cash management bills. Most of the remaining $18 billion of
new money raised during June was obtained in auctions of intermediate-term
coupons.
In the third quarter, the staff expects that the Treasury will borrow
about $51 billion, net, to help finance a projected deficit of $53 billion.
The Treasury already has raised $8-1/2 billion of this total through 7-year
notes and 20-year bonds that were auctioned in late June for settlement
early in July.
Federally sponsored credit agencies paid down $1.8 billion in debt in
May, but are estimated to have borrowed about $1 billion in June. Over the
past two months, the FHLBs reduced their outstanding liabilities by an esti-
mated $1.3 billion, reflecting seasonal declines in advances to thrifts as
well as a reduction in the agency's liquidity. FNMA is also estimated to
have reduced its debt obligations by about $1.3 billion during the May-June
period. While the agency continued to make substantial purchases of mort-
gages, it reduced its need to borrow by issuing pass-through securities.
Borrowings by the FFCBs have been essentially flat since April, while both
the FHLMC and the SLMA have undertaken significant amounts of borrowing.
State and local sector. Yields on tax-exempt securities are only

are well above their levels in early May. The volume of gross offerings
of tax-exempt bonds is estimated to have fallen to $5.2 billion in June,
primarily as a result of the rise in yields. Refunding issues, which are
relatively rate sensitive, dropped off in June to about half their May
volume. The July 1 effective date for statutory registration requirements
also damped June offerings, given the normal settlement lags.
A recent court ruling against "take-or-pay" utility contracts has
virtually assured that WPPSS will default on interest payments due on bonds
issued to finance nuclear project Nos. 4 and 5.1 Although the court ruling
applies only to the state of Washington, it raises some question about the

1. The Washington State Supreme Court ruled on June 15 that the 29 Washing-
ton public utility districts and municipal utilities, which collectively
own nearly 70 percent of WPPSS project Nos. 4 and 5, were not authorized
under state law to enter into "take-or-pay" contracts that secure the bonds
for the two nuclear projects. "Take-or-pay" agreements require participat-
ing utilities to repay bondholders, even if the utilities purchase no elec-
tricity because the plants are not completed or operable.

III-13
use of such contracts by joint power projects in other states. Thus far,
however, WPPSS developments appear to have had a limited impact on munici-
pal markets. There has been no apparent indication of a flight to quality
by investors in municipal securities: the spreads between A-rated and Aaa-
rated municipal bond yields, and between revenue and general obligation
bond yields, have remained nearly unchanged at relatively low levels. More-
over, the volume of tax-exempt bond issuance by utilities generally remains
high.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates in mortgage markets have backed up since the last FOMC
meeting, and field reports and trade opinions indicate that credit demands
have slackened recently. Average interest rates on new commitments for
fixed-rate conventional home mortgages at S&Ls have risen by about 1/2 of
a percentage point to 13.08 percent. After average discounts on new issues
of GNMA-guaranteed pass-through securities for forward delivery climbed
above 6 points in the secondary market early last month, the rate ceilings
on regular FHA/VA home mortgages was raised by 50 basis points to 12 per-
cent, effective June 8-the first increase since early 1982. These dis-
counts recently have moved up to nearly 8 points, raising the distinct pos-
sibility of another near-term hike in the FHA/VA ceilings.
The cost of adjustable-rate home mortgage credit has turned around
even more sharply, narrowing the initial differential between costs of
credit on fixed-rate loans compared with adjustable-rate loans. In early
May, when the initial rate differential favored flexible-rate financing
more than it does now, the average proportion of fixed-rate contracts on
all home first mortgages closed by major institutional originators remained

near the 71 percent level recorded in early April--one of the highest
shares in several years. Many borrowers evidently prefer arrangements
offering certainty on the size of payments plus the potential for refinanc-
ing if market rates should decline.1
S&Ls slowed their pace of net acquisitions of mortgage assets in May
to a combined total of $2.9 billion in mortgages and mortgage-backed secu-
rities. The volume of new loans made by insured S&Ls stayed heavy, although
off a bit from the pace earlier in the year, while net sales of mortgages
and portfolio repayments were large. Outstanding mortgage commitments at
S&Ls reached a new high in May, but new commitments made edged down for the
second consecutive month. Net mortgage lending at commercial banks strength-
ened in May, exceeding the improved first-quarter average for the second
consecutive month; estimates for June show a further acceleration.
With housing sales up, due-on-sale clauses in conventional mortgages
now readily enforceable, and the costs of mortgage credit lower, repayments
on S&L portfolios of mortgages-including prepayments on older loans-have
climbed to some of the highest levels of the past two decades.2 By May,
repayments were at a monthly rate of 1.2 percent of mortgage balances held
at the end of the previous month. To an extent, this higher payoff rate
on S&L portfolios probably has enhanced opportunities for these institutions
to upgrade their earnings by reinvesting the proceeds from older mortgages
1. According to the mid-May survey of Senior Loan Officer Opinion on Bank
Lending Practices, about a third of the panel--roughly the same proportion
as in the two previous surveys--indicated that home mortgage credit demand
during the three months prior to the survey had shifted toward fixed-rate
loans. As in the mid-November survey, over three fourths of respondents
originating fixed-rate home mortgages reported that they intended to sell
these loans rather than hold them.
2. Refinancing also has spurted on regular mortgages insured by FHA on
existing homes, but still accounts for a minor share of aggregate activity.

at current market yields. Refinancings, however, were also strong, so that
some repayments represent a flow of principal from the high-yielding loans
made in recent years.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit grew at an 8 percent annual rate during
April, slightly above the average for the first quarter. Data available
for commercial banks as well as recent strength in auto sales suggest that
the pace of net consumer borrowing has accelerated further since April.
The recent growth in consumer installment credit outstanding has been
stronger than in comparable periods in previous cycles. This relatively
robust growth appears to have coincided with shifting supply conditions in
consumer credit markets, owing in part to the relaxation of restrictive
usury ceilings.
Interest rates on consumer installment loans declined somewhat fur-
ther in recent months. Commercial bank finance rates for closed-end loans
dropped by 90 to 100 basis points from early February to early May. Rates
for new-automobile credit at finance companies averaged slightly below 12
percent in April and May, reflecting the continuation of special financing
programs offered by the auto manufacturers.
Delinquency rates on closed-end consumer loans at commercial banks
edged upward during the past 12 months, after sharp declines dating from
the third quarter of 1980. The delinquency rate at auto finance companies
continued to fall and by the end of March was at the lowest level since
1968. Delinquency rates on mortgage loans were at record highs in the first
quarter, but showed indications of leveling off. Personal bankruptcy fil-
ings during April fell considerably below the first-quarter pace.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Between the last FOMC meeting and June 15, the dollar appreciated
almost three percent on a weighted-average basis to a new high, slightly
above its November 1982 level. Since then the dollar has slipped back
about one-half percent. The rise in the dollar was generally associated
with increases in the differential between U.S. and foreign interest
rates, as shown in the lower panel of the chart. At times, political
tensions in the Middle East were cited as an additional factor. The
record monthly U.S. merchandise trade deficit reported on June 28 did
not seem to have a major short-run impact on dollar exchange rates.
The pound appreciated by over two percent against the dollar in the
week following the last FOMC meeting; growing confidence in a victory for
the ruling Conservative Party in the June 9 election was probably the
major factor. Since then the pound has depreciated by about four per-
cent. The depreciation has been associated with the Bank of England
lowering of its money market intervention rates and with reductions in
base lending rates of one-half percentage point to 9-1/2 percent by major
U.K. banks. Since the last FOMC meeting the differential between U.S.
90-day CDs and the 90-day London sterling interbank rate has increased by
over one percentage point.
The configuration of the EMS remains largely unchanged since the
last FOMC meeting, with the mark still near its floor against the French
franc.

Swiss banks raised their customer time deposit rates by 3/4 per-

U.S. banks' foreign lending in first quarter. U.S.-chartered
banks' claims on non-OPEC developing countries and on smaller developed
countries increased only slightly in the first quarter, and net new
lending to these countries was substantially less than in the fourth
quarter of 1982 or in the year-earlier period. As a result of this
slowing of new credits, combined with a reduction in outstanding claims
on offshore banking centers, total U.S. bank claims on foreigners
declined $2.7 billion in the quarter, following small increases in such
claims in the last two quarters of 1982.
The OPEC countries and G-10 countries were the only groups to
which net new lending was stronger than in the first quarter of last
year. For the non-OPEC developing countries, claims rose $0.5 billion
compared with $1.3 billion a year earlier and an average increase of
about $2.6 billion in the previous four quarters. On the other hand, it
is noteworthy that there was no absolute decline in claims on these
countries as a group. The reduced net new lending to the smaller
developed countries largely reflected a decline in claims on Spain.
Most of the changes in claims on individual non-OPEC
developing countries were quite small, as shown in Table 2. For the
four largest borrowers, claims rose $0.3 billion on Mexico, $0.1 billion
each on Brazil and Argentina, and were unchanged as regards Korea.
Among other important borrowers the largest changes were a $0.4 billion
increase on the Philippines and a $0.3 billion decrease on Chile.
In March, both Brazil and Mexico made initial drawings on the
large commercial bank loans that were part of the financial packages
arranged for them last winter. The shares of U.S.-chartered banks in

these drawings were about $1 billion in the case of Brazil and $0.7 bil-
lion as regards Mexico. In the case of Brazil, the difference between
this $1 billion drawing and the $0.1 billion rise in claims is partly
explained by Brazilian repayments of one-half, or about $600 million, of
the bridge credits received from U.S. banks in the fourth quarter of
1982. In addition, claims on Brazil held by U.S. bank branches located
in that country, which are mostly denominated in cruzeiros, were reduced
by $0.4 billion equivalent because of the 28 percent devaluation of the
cruzeiro in February. With respect to Mexico, the difference between
the $0.7 billion loan disbursement and the $0.3 billion rise in claims is
partly explained by $150-200 million of Mexican payments on trade
credits, which are not covered by the debt repayment freeze in effect
since August 1982. Private Mexican debtors may also have paid off other
debts with funds held in the United States or otherwise beyond the reach
of Mexican exchange controls.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Domestic offices of U.S. chartered banks (including IBFs), which
had made net advances of about $14 billion to their own foreign offices
between December 1982 and March of this year, reduced these outstanding
advances by almost $6 billion in the second quarter. (see line 1b of the
International Banking Table.) The reduction in outstanding advances
likely reflects in part the recovery of Eurodollar deposits at foreign
branches of U.S. banks by U.S. nonbank residents. In the first quarter,
total Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbank residents increased by $4
billion (line 3 below) despite a sizable decline in such holdings by
money market mutual funds. Much of the growth during the first quarter
occurred in March and partial data for the second quarter indicate that
this strong growth has

During the first six months of this year, banks chartered in the
United States and banks in other major industrialized countries
apparently have scaled back their international interbank trading
activities in Eurodollar and U.S. domestic markets. Data reported by the
foreign branches of U.S. chartered banks indicate that a sharp drop in
gross claims on foreign banks was matched by a sharp drop in liabilities
in the first four months of the year. Similarly, data reported by the
U.S. agencies and branches of banks based in major industrialized
countries indicate that they have made offsetting reductions in both
their gross claims and liabilities on U.S. banks between December 1982
and mid-June. These reductions in interbank transactions may reflect
efforts by banks to reduce the size of their balance sheets at a time of
rising concern about capital adequacy.
In the first quarter of the year there was a reduction in interbank
credit extended in the U.S. market to U.S. agencies and branches of banks
based in several developing countries (Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina,
Mexico). During this period, total net borrowings in the U.S. interbank
market by those agencies and branches fell by about $1 billion. These
reductions in borrowing have been replaced by funding from related
foreign offices of the individual banks.
The boom in the U.S. stock market has been accompanied by $3.7
billion in net foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stock in the first
four months of the year (line 2b of Summary Table of U.S. International
Transactions), an amount which slightly exceeded net purchases for all of
1982. At the same time, net U.S. purchases of foreign corporate stock
and bonds each amounted to about $1.5 billion over this same period (see
line 2c for total).

IV-9
Foreign official reserve assets held in the United States rose only
$0.6 billion through April of 1983, as reductions in OPEC holdings of
official reserve assets in the United States of $2.4 billion were nearly
matched by increases in holdings of G-10 countries. Partial data
available from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicate that OPEC
countries have continued to reduce their official reserve assets by an
additional $1.5 billion between the end of April and June of this year.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit was substantially larger in May
than in the preceding eight months. Imports rose in May, primarily
because oil imports increased from unusually low levels but also because
of a rise in automotive imports from Japan. The increase in imports of
foreign cars reflected the beginning of a new auto agreement-year with
Japan, very low U.S. stocks of Japanese cars, and rising sales. Exports
in May were at about the same rate as in April; a small decline in
agricultural exports was offset by some increases in nonagricultural
exports.
For April-May combined, the trade deficit was $61 billion at an
annual rate, a deficit larger than in any previous quarter. Exports
declined 3 percent from first-quarter rates while imports rose 9 percent.

Just under half of the substantial rise in imports in April-May was
accounted for by oil. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the volume of oil
imports in May rose to almost 6 million barrels per day (mbd) from
averages of about 4 mbd both in 1Q83 and in April. Oil import prices
rose 15 cents per barrel in May but were still $1.85 below the
first-quarter price. See the table below. Oil imports were unusually
low in the first four months of the year in response to two temporary
market situations: lower oil consumption than expected (warmer winter)
and uncertainties regarding OPEC pricing and production (an agreement was
reached mid-March). These developments contributed to falling prices (by
about $2 to $4 per barrel) at a time when private inventories were being
drawn down. Since March, spot prices have increased somewhat and have
currently stabilized at or slightly above official prices. The upward
price movement was reflected in recent price increases by Egypt and the
USSR; both countries price their crude oil according to movements in the
spot market. However, the United Kingdom has proposed to keep its price
unchanged through the third quarter, and various OPEC members indicated
that OPEC intends to maintain its $29 per barrel market price through the
end of the year.

Nonoil imports increased strongly in April-May in a wide range of
items from industrial supplies to automotive imports from Japan.
Automotive imports from Canada also increased strongly in response to
rising U.S. domestic car sales (cars are assembled in Canada using a
large proportion of U.S. parts).
The decline in exports was partly in agricultural commodities,
especially wheat (for which world supplies are plentiful) and soybeans.
For soybeans, most of the decline was in shipments to the EEC as U.S.
soybeans became more expensive relative to competing home-market
feedgrain prices.
Most of the decline in exports in April-May was in nonagricultural
items, particularly industrial supplies and machinery. Exports to these
two categories of goods, which account for two-thirds of nonagricultural
exports, dropped 13 percent in value and 16 percent in volume since the
third quarter of last year as a result of sluggish economic activity in
major foreign markets and the continued strong exchange value of the
dollar. Commercial aircraft exports dropped back from a very strong
first quarter rate; those exports went largely to developed countries.
By area, most of the increased trade deficit in April-May was
concentrated in Latin America and Western Europe. Only part of that rise
was from oil imports. Overall, two-thirds of the increased deficit was
attributable to a drop in exports (especially to Western Europe but also
to Latin America and to other developing countries) and to a rise in
nonoil imports that was fairly widespread among areas-- Latin America,
Canada, Western Europe, and Japan.

IV-15
Foreign economic developments. Recent data from the major
industrial countries indicate that recovery is proceeding, though at a
rather moderate and uneven pace. In most countries the recovery has not
yet become broadly based, and strength in private investment in plant and
equipment is conspicuously lacking. No signs of inroads into high levels
of unemployment abroad are evident yet. Germany, Canada, and the United
Kingdom all reported stronger growth of GNP in the first quarter. The
United Kingdom appears to have finally emerged from a prolonged, deep
recession, and Canada has rebounded from the sharp drop in output of last
year. Stronger growth in these two countries has been supported by an
increased pace of stock building (slower destocking in Canada) and
moderate increases in private consumption. Though real growth in Italy
was positive for the first time in several quarters, the Italian index of
industrial production has continued its extended decline. Broadly-based
recovery has not yet taken hold in Japan either, where first-quarter
growth was disappointingly weak. Data show increases in output in
Germany and France through April, but the unemployment rate rose in May
to 9-1/2 percent in Germany and the French economy continues to be
troubled by an unemployment rate of nearly 9 percent.
Price pressures abroad have abated or held steady in most countries
except in France, where relaxation of controls has given rise to strong
advances. Recent moderate wage settlements in Germany, Japan, and Canada
have improved further the prospects for control of inflation.
Some large swings in trade and current-account positions of the
major industrial countries have been seen in recent months. In

IV-16
the United Kingdom, the current account declined by about $300 million
(s.a.) in May following April's fall of almost $1 billion. In April, the
Italian trade account (n.s.a.) declined by about $1 billion, and in May
the French trade deficit increased by $800 million (s.a.). A prominent
exception to this pattern is Japan where the current-account surplus in
May held steady at $2.3 billion (s.a.). This brings the cumulative five-
month surplus for Japan in 1983 to more than $8 billion, and public
attention has begun to focus once again on imbalances in Japanese trade
relations.
In recent elections, the ruling parties in both the United Kingdom
and Japan strengthened their positions, but in Italy the controlling
Christian Democratic party lost ground, making necessary the formation of
another precarious coalition government.
In Japan, despite some tentative signs that a recovery may begin
soon, the economy has continued to stagnate in recent months. According
to recently released GNP figures for the first quarter, real growth was
only 0.6 percent (s.a.a.r.), the third quarter in a row in which the
growth rate has been halved. All components of domestic demand
experienced weaker growth than in the fourth quarter, except government
consumption. Recent gains in industrial production have been an
encouraging sign. For the three months ending in May, industrial
production was about 7 percent (s.a.a.r.) above that of the previous
three months. The unemployment rate in May continued to stand at almost
2.7 percent (s.a.) -an extremely high level by modern Japanese
standards. Recent surveys of the economy by the Japanese Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) have not been positive about near-term prospects,

IV-17
but have found some grounds for guarded optimism -- particularly in a
sharp rise in the EPA index of leading indicators at the end of the first
quarter.
Price developments continue to be favorable in Japan. Following a
strong advance in May, the CPI fell by 0.7 percent in June; the year-
over-year increase in June of 1.9 percent was the least in 16 years.
Wholesale prices continued to decline for the sixth month in the previous
seven, and the WPI in May was more than 2 percent below its year-previous
level.
The May current-account surplus of over $2.3 billion (s.a.) was
virtually unchanged from April's record level, bringing the five-month
cumulative surplus to $8.1 billion. Imports declined markedly again,
while exports continued to display the renewed strength that they have
shown since the beginning of the year, raising concern that Japan may
accumulate an extraordinarily large surplus this year.
In the June 26 Upper House elections, Prime Minister Nakasone's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party strengthened its majority position.
In Germany, some signs of strength are evident in recent data.
German real GNP grew at a rate of 2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter, supported primarily by private consumption and investment in
equipment. In contrast to past recoveries, net exports have not yet
contributed to GNP growth. Industrial production fell 1 percent in
April and remained unchanged in May. Although the May index stood about
3 percent above its level of late last year, it still was below its level
of one year ago. The rate of unemployment continued to rise in May,
however, reaching 9.5 percent (s.a.), a figure which represents 2.3

IV-18
million unemployed workers.
The rate of consumer-price inflation continued to slow in June to
2-1/2 percent on a year-over-year basis. On a seasonally adjusted basis,
the level of consumer prices is below that at the end of 1982. Wholesale
prices and import prices have been below their year-earlier levels for
several months. Early this month, the union of public employees -- the
largest in Germany -- agreed to a 2.8 percent wage increase over the
coming 12 months.
The current account through May has recorded a surplus of almost
$2-1/2 billion, compared with approximate balance for last year's
corresponding period. This improvement in the current account is due to
an increase in the German terms of trade and a reduction in interest
payments on foreign loans. The volume of net exports has actually fallen
slightly since mid-1982.
Fiscal policy will remain tight according to the latest budget
estimates for FY 1984. The federal deficit is projected to fall further
in response to budget cuts to about DM 36 billion (about 2-1/2 percent of
GDP) from this year's estimated DM 40 billion deficit.
In the United Kingdom real GDP rose 4-1/4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
first quarter, continuing the moderate but steady recovery in real
economic activity that began in the final quarter of 1981. Industrial
production rose in April by slightly more than it had declined in March
to reach a level 1.6 percent (s.a.) above the January figure.
Unemployment data have recently been revised for the past several years,
and there have been some changes in reporting procedures. On the new
basis, the May figure of 12.4 percent (s.a.) was down from April's level

IV-19
of 12.7 percent.
Retail price inflation decreased again in May to 3.7 percent on a
year-over-year basis -- an extraordinarily low figure by recent
historical standards. This reflects not only a slowing of current price
increases but also a fairly sizable increase in the retail price index in
May of last year. Both the trade and current-account balances were in
deficit in May. The cumulative trade deficit through May was almost $2
billion (s.a.), while the cumulative current account was near balance.
Through May of last year, the trade and current balances were in surplus
by $0.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.
The recent reelection of the Conservative government will permit
the implementation in the coming months of the monetary and fiscal
measures announced in the March budget. Some moderate expansionary
fiscal measures, including tax cuts for individuals and business, as well
as legislative restrictions on union power, were announced in the speech
outlining the government's program that was recently delivered by Queen
Elizabeth to Parliament.
The Canadian economy has begun to grow after an 18-month
contraction. Real GNP advanced at a vigorous 7.2 percent rate (s.a.a.r.)
in the first quarter. This growth largely reflected a sharp deceleration
of inventory runoffs; although inventories did decline in the first
quarter, as they have continuously since 1981-Q4, the decline of 0.9
percent of real GNP was less than one-half the average quarterly decline
for 1982. Real private consumption expenditure also contributed to the
recovery; it moved ahead to record an annual growth rate of 2.8 percent
in the first quarter, up from the 2 percent increase in the fourth

IV-20
quarter. These advances contrast with the declines in real private
consumption that characterized the first three quarters of 1982.
The private investment picture remains weak, with the exception of
a continued strong performance in residential construction, but a sharp
increase in capacity utilization in the first quarter is a promising
sign. Progress on unemployment has been less dramatic, as the
unemployment rate edged down to 12.4 percent in May from 12.5 percent in
April.
The inflation picture has shown continued improvement. The
consumer price index remained unchanged in April and rose 0.3 percent in
May, making the cumulative rise since January only 4.3 percent (a.r.).
This is about half of the rate of CPI increase seen in 1982. Non-indexed
wage agreements also showed substantial moderation in the first quarter
with a 6.6 percent increase (a.r.) compared with the 10 percent average
increase in 1982.
With the quickened pace of activity, the current account in the
first quarter declined by about $700 million (s.a.). Real imports of
goods and services advanced at a quarterly rate of 6 percent, while real
exports increased by 3.8 percent.
Despite a 1 percent fall in domestic demand, real GDP in Italy rose
slightly (1.2 percent, s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter as real exports
climbed by 5-1/2 percent. Real imports remained flat, reflecting the
influence of the continued recession. (Part of the increase also may be
a reflection of faulty seasonal adjustment.) Industrial production
plummeted in April to a level 18 percent below the previous cyclical peak
of early 1980. Although consumer surveys taken in the first five months

IV-21
of the year reveal a slight improvement in consumer confidence, the
readings in these polls are still below the levels recorded last spring.
Consumer price inflation has moderated recently. In the three-
month period ending in June, prices were about 12 percent (a.r.) above
the level of the previous three months and 16 percent above the level of
the corresponding period last year. Wholesale prices in May were 10
percent above their year-earlier level. In the first four months of this
year, the trade deficit was $3.3 billion (n.s.a.), compared with a
deficit of $7 billion in the same period last year.
In general and local elections in late June, the controlling
Christian Democratic Party lost ground, and negotiations are currently
under way to form a new coalition government. One problem the new
government will have to face is the size of the enlarged public sector
deficit which last year was 15-1/2 percent of GDP; a similar figure is
expected this year under current policies. On June 30, Bank of Italy
effected its decision of last December to remove bank credit ceilings,
stating its intention to rely more on "market-related" tools, such as
reserve requirements and the discount rate, to implement changes in
policy.
Economic activity in France remains sluggish. Industrial
production in April, despite a reversal of the previous month's 0.8
percent (a.r.) decline, was at the same level as in the first two months
of this year and was unchanged from its level of April last year. The
unemployment rate has held relatively steady for over a year; the May
figure was up slightly to 8.8 percent (s.a.). Industrialists are
reportedly expecting no increase in economic activity for the remainder

of the year. The advance in consumer prices in May of 0.7 percent was
only half as large as the jump in April. However, for the seven-month
period following the lifting of price controls last October, consumer
prices increased at an annual rate of over 11 percent, substantially
above the government's announced target of 8 percent for 1982 as a whole.
The current account in the first quarter of 1983 was in deficit by
$3.6 billion (s.a.), a larger deficit than that recorded in the first
quarter last year, and well above the average quarterly deficit in 1982.
The trade deficit was sharply reduced in April as imports declined, but
imports and the deficit returned in May to the high levels of earlier in
the year. For the first five months of this year, trade was in deficit
at an annual rate of nearly $12 billion (s.a.), only slightly below the
near-record deficit rate of last year.
At the end of May the government announced a further tightening of
credit controls that is designed to lower M2 growth this year to 9
percent (December/December). The latter figure is the target announced
in March as part of the government's austerity program. M2 growth last
year (December/December) was 11.7 percent.
Major Debt Problem Situations in Developing Countries
Mexico was in full compliance with the first-quarter performance
criteria specified in its arrangement with the IMF. This enabled it to
draw about $326 million from the IMF at the end of May. The proceeds
were used to reduce the outstanding balance of the emergency credits that
were extended to Mexico by the BIS, the U.S. Treasury, and the Federal
Reserve; the remaining balance is scheduled to be repaid by August 23.
The IMF drawing made Mexico eligible for a $1.1 billion drawdown on the

IV -26
$5 billion commercial bank credit signed in March. This installment has
not yet been drawn, reflecting an easing of Mexico's foreign exchange
position. Mexico recorded a merchandise trade surplus of $4.4 billion in
the first four months of this year, compared with a deficit of nearly $1
billion in the same period last year. The consumer price index increased
by 3.8 percent in June--the smallest monthly increase in fourteen
months--but was about 37 percent higher than in December 1982 and about
112 percent higher than in June 1982. Effective June 14, the minimum
wage was raised by about 15 percent, bringing it only to about 43 percent
above the level that prevailed during the last nine months of last year.
Brazil failed to meet several first-quarter performance tests under
its agreement with the IMF. As a result, the drawing that had been
scheduled for May 31 was delayed. Since Brazilian drawings of new money
from the banks depend on its being in compliance with the IMF program, a
$635 million disbursement from the banks was also delayed. As a result,
Brazil was unable to make a repayment to the BIS and has received two
extensions so far. Since early June, Brazil has introduced additional
monetary and fiscal policy measures in the hope of regaining access to
the IMF and bank money. These measures include some tightening of wage
policy and some reduction in price and credit subsidies. The IMF is
seeking deeper cuts in public enterprise spending and a further tighten-
ing of wage policy. Meanwhile, Brazil's public sector arrears have risen
to about $1.2 billion. A single steering group of banks to advise Brazil
on its financing problems has been organized, taking the place of the
four separate committees of banks that previously were dealing with the
four financing projects that Brazil had undertaken.

IV -27
Argentina met the principal first-quarter performance tests speci-
fied under its IMF stand-by arrangement and obtained a waiver on some
relatively minor violations, enabling it to draw $325 million from the
IMF. Negotiations with banks are continuing on a $1.5 billion medium-
term loan and on a restructuring of an estimated $6 billion of external
public and publicly-guaranteed debt due in 1983. On July 1, it was
announced that Argentina had agreed to use the $300 million balance of a
bridge loan to bring interest current. Argentina is seeking a waiver
from the IMF and the banks of the requirement that interest arrears be
eliminated by June 30.
Venezuela telexed creditor banks on June 29, asking them to extend
for another three months beyond June 30 the 90-day moratorium on repay-
ments of public sector debt, which totals about $25 billion. On June 6,
Venezeula presented its creditor banks with a plan to reschedule all $15
billion of public sector debt maturing in 1983 and $2.3 billion maturing
in 1984. The banks have reserved their position pending Venezuela's
discussions with the IMF. Venezuela has announced plans to draw from
the IMF about $1.5 billion (consisting of its reserve position in the
Fund, its first credit tranche, and its SDR holdings) and to ask for a
$1.1 billion drawing from the IMF's Compensatory Financing Facility for
export shortfalls.
Chile has made substantial progress with its plans to restructure
some of its external debt and to raise new loans. Chile's request to the
banks that its short-term trade credits be maintained at the end-January
level has been surpassed. With this strong bank support of the Chilean
financing plan, the IMF is expected to restore Chile's ability to draw

IV -28
under its stand-by arrangement at the end of July. On June 29, Peru's
foreign bank creditors agreed to roll over $2 billion in short-term
credit lines, to refinance over eight years $380 million of medium-term
debt maturing from March 1983 to March 1984 and to provide $450 million
in new money. In addition, Peru has requested a rescheduling of princi-
pal and interest payments owed to official creditors through February
1985.
An agreement to reschedule about $2.6 billion in Ecuador's public
and private sector debts owed to banks up to the end of 1983 was signed
in June 1983. The banks are being asked to provide $430 million in new
credits. An IMF stand-by arrangement was approved early in June and is
scheduled to take effect if and when the IMF receives assurances that the
new bank credits will be available. Ecuador has also requested a
rescheduling of a portion of the debt owed to official creditors.
The Philippines in recent months has begun to experience external
financing problems, brought on in part by sluggish export receipts, an
increase in debt service payments due to an increase in the amount of
short-term external debt, and a cut-back in foreign bank credits. The
current account deficit, which has been increasing for several years,
reportedly increased further in the first half of 1983. The Government
has allowed the peso to depreciate against the dollar by about 10 percent
during the first 25 weeks of this year (and 26 percent since mid-1980).
On June 23 the Government announced a further 7.3 percent devaluation of
the peso, a cut in public investment, and the discontinuance of the
subsidy of petroleum products. These steps complement measures taken
earlier in the year in the context of a one-year IMF stand-by arrange-

IV -29
ment approved in February. A mid-term review of the stand-by program
has shown that, due to a worsening in the capital account, the Phili-
ppines had lost more international reserves than had been expected.
Largely as a result of the review, it was agreed that credit policy
would be tightened further.
