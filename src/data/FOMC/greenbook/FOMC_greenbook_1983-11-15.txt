The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent data indicate continued strong growth in economic activity,
although gains appear to have moderated somewhat from the rapid pace
during the spring. Industrial production and employment registered
further solid advances in October. Consumer spending picked up in
September after a summer lull, and the recovery in investment spending
strengthened. In contrast, housing starts backed off after the August
surge, and the foreign sector continued to be a restraining factor on
domestic activity. Wage and price increases in recent months have
been somewhat larger than the low rates seen earlier this year.
Industrial Production
Industrial production rose by 1-1/2 percent in September, and pre-
liminary data suggest a further increase in October. Output of consumer
goods apparently increased in October, reflecting a slight rise in
automotive products and home goods as well as further gain in the output
of nondurable consumer goods. Auto assemblies dipped to a 7.5 million
unit annual rate in October--reportedly because of a lack of parts
for GM's X-cars; but current production schedules call for assemblies
to rise to an 8.0 million unit annual rate in November. Output of
business equipment advanced strongly with substantial increases in
commercial equipment, manufacturing equipment, and truck output.
Production in the cyclically-sensitive materials sector continued to
advance last month and has expanded around 20 percent in the ten months
since its recent low in December 1982.

1. The 1978-80 high is below the 1967-82 average because of the unusually
slow growth in demand for electricity.

II-3
Capacity utilization rose 1.0 percentage point in September to 78.1
percent, and is expected to show around a 1/2 percentage point further
advance for October. The rebound in utilization rates from the postwar
low reached last November has been quicker than in previous cycles,
increasing 8.5 percentage points in ten months. The faster-than-normal
recovery in capacity utilization results from a slowdown in the growth
of capacity combined with a normal recovery in output. Nonetheless,
the utilization rate is still appreciably below the 1967-82 average of
82.4 percent.
Employment and Unemployment
The demand for labor was strong again in October. The payroll
measure of employment rose 320,000, and the increase for September was
revised up to 340,000 on a strike-adjusted basis. Although the household
measure of employment was unchanged in October, the cumulative increases
since last December in payroll and total civilian employment total 2.4
million and 2.8 million, respectively.
The rise in nonfarm payroll employment in October was concentrated
in the manufacturing and services industries. Employment in durable
goods manufacturing rose 140,000 with significant gains occurring in
every major industry. Among nondurables, employment increased in the
apparel and rubber and plastics industries, but fell in food processing,
apparently a spillover from the drought-induced drop in farm production.
The factory workweek backed off slightly to 40-1/2 hours in October,
after surging in September. Employment in establishments offering
business and personal services was up another 100,000 in October, and

retail trade employment continued to strengthen. Construction jobs
rose about 50,000 in October, the seventh consecutive monthly gain.
The civilian unemployment rate fell 1/2 percentage point to 8.8
percent in October and is now 2 percentage points below its December
1982 high. This large drop in the October jobless rate appears to
reflect both the continued rehiring of workers on layoff and an unusually
weak inflow of new jobseekers. The unemployment rate for prime-age
men posted a sharp decline last month, probably related to a 200,000
drop in the number of unemployed workers on layoff. Employment gains
for laid-off workers have accounted for 60 percent of the reduction in
joblessness since the recovery began. The jobless rate for adult
women also declined, but this appeared to be associated with a weakness
in labor force participation.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal personal income grew in September at an 11 percent
annual rate, the largest monthly increase since May. The gain reflected
a hefty $16 billion rise in nonlabor income--chiefly rental and personal
interest income--as well as the continued brisk expansion of wages and
salaries. October income is likely to show another sizable increase
corresponding to the growth in employment and wages. Real disposable
personal income rose sharply in the third quarter, increasing by an
estimated 6.7 percent, as the advances in nominal income were augmented
by the tax cut in July and were accompanied by continued moderate
inflation. Increases in disposable income outpaced the growth in
consumption in the third quarter, and the saving rate move up from 4.0
percent to 4.7 percent, still low in historical terms.

II-7
Consumer spending rose briskly in September, following sluggish
growth over the preceding two months. For the third quarter as a whole,
total retail sales rose 1.3 percent (not at an annual rate) down from
the near-record growth rate of 5.9 percent in the second quarter. Most
of the deceleration occurred in the automotive group. Excluding autos,
the drop-off in growth was much smaller--slipping only 1/2 percentage
point to 2.5 percent in the third quarter. Purchases of discretionary
items, as measured by the GAF grouping, have risen briskly this year;
sales of furniture and appliances have shown substantial strength,
while spending for apparel remains near the advanced second quarter
level.
The rate of domestic auto sales picked up in September, regaining
the average pace it had reached during the spring; sales edged up
slightly further in October to a 7.1 million unit rate. Sales of imports
jumped to a 2.6 million unit rate-apparently owing to an increased
stock of Japanese cars.
Consumers remained optimistic about the outlook in October, as
both the Michigan Survey Research Center and the Conference Board
measures of confidence continued at the high levels reported since the
spring. Attitudes towards purchases of cars, appliances, and houses
were still very favorable. The expected inflation rate for the next
12 months-at 5.2 percent according to the Michigan survey--was a bit
higher than reported earlier this year, but still below the figures
reported in 1982.

Housing Markets
Housing activity has tapered off in the past few months, reflecting
increases in mortgage costs earlier in the year. Private housing
starts dropped in September after a sharp surge in August, falling 13
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.65 million units.
Residential building permits declined 7 percent in August and contracted
an additional 9 percent in September. The decline in construction was
widespread by major geographic region.
Home sales, which had weakened a bit earlier than actual construction
activity, picked up in September, and may be signalling some bottoming
of the decline in homebuilding. After falling since mid-year, existing-home
sales showed little change in September, and sales of new houses spurted
14 percent.
Despite the generally improved market over the past year, increases
in home prices have remained moderate. Although the average price of
a new home sold in the third quarter was 10 percent above its year
earlier level, part of this change captures increases in the size and
the quality of homes sold. During the same period, the deflator for
residential investment expenditures--a quality-adjusted index of the
price for building a new home--rose 2-1/2 percent, and the index of
existing-home prices, which is less susceptible to changes in quality
mix, increased 3-1/2 percent.
Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment increased vigorously in the third quarter.
The expansion largely reflected a turnaround in commercial structures
and persistent strength in equipment spending.

Constant-dollar spending on producers' durable equipment rose
almost 16 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, after a
20 percent increase in the previous quarter. Gains in equipment spending
in the third quarter were broadly based; expenditures on office and
store machinery continued to increase, and heavy industrial equipment
also rebounded strongly, after two quarters of relatively small
gains. Sales of motor vehicles also were quite robust in the third
quarter. Data for orders through September indicate that the healthy
growth in equipment spending will likely be maintained. Excluding the
volatile aircraft and parts category, new orders for nondefense capital
goods rose 5 percent in the third quarter on top of a 12 percent increase
in the spring.
In real terms, nonresidential construction increased 12 percent
at an annual rate last quarter, the first rise since the end of 1981.
Gains were widespread across most categories, but were particularly
strong in the non-office component of commercial construction--consisting
primarily of shopping centers, other retail stores, and warehouses--
after sharp declines in the previous quarter. Office construction,
which had declined for three straight quarters also rose a bit in the
third quarter; however, reported office vacancy rates remain high.
The construction of industrial buildings, which has been falling for
more than a year, fell again in the third quarter.
Amidst a climate of strengthening corporate cash positions,
sharply higher profitability, and rising capacity utilization rates,
recent private surveys of capital spending intentions suggest that the

current recovery in business investment will continue at a moderate
pace next year. The McGraw-Hill fall survey showed an anticipated
rise of about 10 percent in nominal plant and equipment spending for
1984, along with expected price increases for capital goods of 5 percent.
The Merrill-Lynch survey indicated a slightly greater increase in
spending, 11 percent. (CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL NOVEMBER 14.) Among the
different industries, manufacturers of durable goods plan to boost
investment the most, while the troubled airline industry expects to
decrease its capital spending.
Business Inventories
The current inventory cycle now has shifted into the accumulation
phase, as production is outpacing shipments and sales. In August, the
book value of manufacturing and trade inventories rose at an annual
rate of $66.1 billion, and preliminary data indicate that manufacturers'
stocks expanded at a $13.3 billion pace in September. With shipments
and sales also rising, the overall inventory-sales ratio in August
increased only slightly and was still considerably below its previous
low in the 1981 expansion phase.
Despite sizable accumulations in August and September, manufacturers'
inventories remain generally lean, with the inventory-sales ratio
for all manufacturing well below its pre-recession low. The increases
in stocks in recent months, while widely distributed across industries,
were concentrated in the raw materials and supplies stage of processing,
a pattern which is typical for this stage in the recovery.
Inventories in the trade sector rose substantially in August, in
part because of a rebuilding of stocks at auto dealers. Auto stocks

continued to increase in September and edged up a bit further in
October, as production continued to outpace sales. Excluding autos,
combined stocks at merchant wholesalers and retail stores, in constant
dollars, grew at an annual rate of $14.8 billion in August. In contrast
to manufacturing inventories and auto inventories, real stocks at
non-auto trade establishments had not fallen to very lean levels before
starting to rise sharply in the spring. The recent inventory behavior
in the trade sector appears to be a reflection of optimistic sales
expectations for the near term.
Farm Output and Inventories
In contrast to the output gains recorded in the nonfarm economy,
farm output has been declining during this year. By the third quarter,
constant dollar farm output had fallen nearly $6 billion from its level
in the fourth quarter of 1982--enough to reduce the level of real GNP by
1/2 percent. The drop in production resulted both from the acreage
reductions associated with the government's payment-in-kind program and
from declines in crop yields caused by the summer drought.
The contraction in farm output, in turn, is leading to a drawdown
of the farm stocks that had accumulated over the two previous years of
bumper crops. Preliminary data from the Commerce Department indicate that
most of the third quarter drawdown was from private inventories, rather
than from CCC stocks; however, large reductions from CCC stocks appear
likely in the coming quarters.
The Government Sector-Federal, State, and Local
In the federal sector, the deficit for fiscal year 1983 is

II-17
reported to be $195 billion, $14 billion below the Administration's
July projection. The discrepancy occurred primarily on the outlay side,
reflecting shortfalls for national defense, in agriculture, and the
international affairs function. Despite the spending shortfalls,
fiscal year 1983 outlays were 9.2 percent above the level a year earlier.
In contrast, receipts were 2.8 percent below their level in fiscal
year 1982, as the loss from the tax cuts under the Economic Recovery
Tax Act was partially offset by advances in income. On net, the deficit
increased $85 billion from fiscal year 1982.
In the first budget resolution for FY1984, passed last June,
Congress called on its tax writing and authorizing committees to submit
legislation by the end of July that would cut $85 billion from the
deficit during the FY1984 to FY1986 period; $73 billion of the cut was
to be from increased taxes and $12 billion from lower outlays. The
House has passed a reconciliation bill with $10 billion of the mandated
cuts in outlays. The Ways and Means Committee has approved only $10
billion of new taxes; moreover, their action has been stalled by several
interest groups affected by its provisions. In the Senate, the Budget
Committee has approved a reconciliation package that would increase
taxes $13 billion and cut spending $15 billion over the next three
years.
In the ongoing FY1984 appropriations process, a total of eight bills
accounting for about 37 percent of total outlays subject to the annual
appropriations process have been enacted. The appropriations passed to
date continue to fall within the limits set in the Congressional Budget
Resolution but exceed the Administration's budget requests. Agencies

and programs for which a regular appropriations bill has not been enacted
are being funded by a stop-gap resolution that expires on November 10.
Another continuing appropriation bill is required at that time.
Spending by state and local governments strengthened in the third
quarter. Real purchases rose at a 5 percent annual rate, bolstered by
a sharp increase in spending on structures. Outlays in other areas
were little changed, and employment in October remained near the 13
million level.
The fiscal situation of state and local governments continues to
improve. With personal tax collections and indirect taxes rising rapidly
this year, the aggregate budget position of these governments-net
of additions to social insurance funds--has moved from a small deficit
in 1982 to a $20 billion surplus last quarter. The rapid rise in
revenues considerably exceeded expectations in many states. California,
for example, began the year with a projected $4.5 billion deficit for
fiscal year 1984, but now a small surplus is being projected, and a
more substantial surplus is expected in fiscal year 1985; much of this
change is attributed to the unexpected strength of the recovery.
Net Exports
The external sector remains a restraining influence on the domestic
economy. The exchange value of the dollar rose by 5 percent in the third
quarter, and the dollar's strength continues to have an adverse effect
on the price competitiveness of U.S. goods. In the third quarter, the
merchandise trade deficit increased to $72 billion (annual rate) from
a second quarter rate of $59 billion, and real net exports of goods and
services in the GNP accounts fell by $3.5 billion. Imports rose sharply

in the third quarter both in value and volume terms, with real imports
of goods and services expanding by $7.2 billion largely in response to
a strengthening in the U.S. economy. Real exports of goods and services
showed a much smaller increase of $3.7 billion, as economic recovery in
major trading partners--particularly in Western Europe--remained sluggish.
For a more complete discussion of international developments, see Part IV.
Prices
Aggregate measures of inflation, which had decelerated rapidly in 1982
and early 1983, have shown no further over the past six months. The consumer
price index rose at an average annual rate of nearly 5-1/2 percent during
the last two quarters, while the pace for producer prices of finished
goods has been about 2-3/4 percent. In both measures, a sharp third-quarter
deceleration in energy prices was offset by more rapid increases for other
items.
At the consumer level, large price increases for new and used cars
were responsible for most of the third-quarter acceleration in nonfood-
nonenergy commodities, to a 7 percent pace (annual rate). In September,
new car prices were up 1 percent-at a monthly rate--reflecting the end
of the latest rebate programs on 1983 models as well as the early intro-
duction of the higher-priced new models, which are not usually priced in
the September survey. The accelerated introduction of 1984 models can be
expected to boost the October index as well. Price increases for most
other consumer commodities, excluding food and energy, continued to be
relatively small in September.

II-22
Food prices at the consumer level advanced at a 3-3/4 percent rate in
September, somewhat above the average pace earlier this year. Drought-
related increases in prices of fresh vegetables and fats and oils were
partially offset by lower prices of meats and other items. Rising production
of meat, particularly pork, helped to hold down food price inflation at
all levels; the PPI for crude foods was flat in September, and trends
in commodity markets point to little change in October. However, meat
production is expected to taper off over the coming year, putting
upward pressure on food prices.
Retail energy prices increased at about an 8 percent rate in September,
as low inventories and rising demand boosted fuel oil prices. However,
spot prices of fuel oil appear to have stabilized recently.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage gains for blue-collar workers continued to slow in the third
quarter, with the hourly earnings index and the blue-collar component of
the employment cost index showing increases of 2-1/2 to 3 percent
(annual rate). The October rise in the hourly earnings index, however,
was somewhat larger than these earlier increases. White-collar wages,
in contrast, apparently accelerated in the third quarter and now have
risen at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate over the first three quarters of
the year--about the same as in 1982. In particular, wages for professional
and technical workers have recently risen rapidly.
New union settlements reached during the first nine months of
1983 contributed to the slow rate of increase in blue-collar wages.

this year accepted initial wage cuts or freezes on base pay. For
all workers under large new settlements, wage rate adjustments averaged
only 1.7 percent in the first contract year and 2.8 percent annually over
the life of these contracts, excluding potential gains under escalator
clauses.
A measure of overall effective wage change for about 8 million
workers under major collective bargaining agreements rose just 3.6
percent at an annual rate over the first nine months of 1983--the
lowest increase for any three-quarter period in the 15-year history of
the series. In addition to smaller COLAs and the low new settlements,
concessions in multi-year contracts negotiated in 1981 and 1982 held
down deferred adjustments under prior agreements.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector continued to rebound
sharply in the third quarter, rising at a 5 percent annual rate after a
6.6 percent increase in the preceding quarter. The relatively good
performance of productivity last year, coupled with the strong cyclical
gains this year, appear at this point to be consistent with a trend rate
of growth in output per hour of a shade more than 1 percent annually.
Rising productivity combined with moderate increases in hourly compensation
have kept unit labor costs virtually constant. With prices rising and
unit labor costs flat, corporate profits have expanded considerably
over the past six months.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1 is estimated to have grown little again in October, but M2, with
a pickup in the expansion of its nontransactions component, accelerated
to about a 9 percent rate of increase. M3 growth at about an 8 percent
pace also was up from September, though only a bit as banks let their
managed liabilities run off. The recent growth patterns of the aggregates
have left them well within their longer-run ranges.
Following the unwinding of quarter-end statement date pressures at
the end of September, federal funds have traded in a rather narrow range
around 9-3/8 percent--somewhat higher than the market seems to have been
anticipating. Most short-term market rates are up 1/8 to 1/4 percentage
point on balance since the October 4 FOMC meeting; however, with unexpec-
tedly strong economic indicators heightening concerns about prospective
credit market pressures, the yield curve has steepened a bit, and rates on
long-term bonds have risen roughly 3/8 of a point. Rates on fixed-rate
mortgages in the primary market have bucked the trend, though, and their
1/4 point decline has produced a relatively narrow spread over bond yields.
One factor weighing on the bond market in the past two weeks has been
the disruption of Treasury financing operations caused by congressional
delay in raising the federal debt ceiling. At a more fundamental level,
though, the continued large federal deficit--together with the lack of
action to deal with the outyear budgetary imbalance--has tended to buoy
security yields. Tax-exempt bond issuance has remained heavy despite
the backup in rates, partly reflecting the desire of many units to borrow
before mortgage revenue bond authority lapses. Businesses, on the other
hand, have avoided the long-term debt markets and, where internal cash

flows have not been sizable enough to cover financing needs, have tended
to rely increasingly on short-term credit. Fragmentary data suggest a
quickening in the rate of growth of household borrowing.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 remained sluggish in October, and the estimated 1 percent annual
rate of expansion left it well down in its long-run monitoring range.
Currency continued to grow briskly, as might be expected in light of the
strong growth of nominal income and spending in the economy. At the same
time, though, the demand deposit component declined for the third straight
month, and other checkable deposits edged down--offsetting that component's
unusually small gain in September. The weakness of M1 deposits in recent
months appears more pronounced than would be expected on the basis of the
rise in interest rates since last spring. Barring big increases over the
next few weeks, M1 should register a sizable quarterly rise in velocity--
the first strong gain in two years.
M2 growth in October was about double its 4-1/2 percent annual rate
of September and moderately above the average pace of the third quarter.
Despite this acceleration, M2 remains below the midpoint of its 1983 target
range. Recent M2 expansion reflects continued rapid growth of small time
deposits at both commercial banks and thrift institutions; the pickup in
such deposits in October, however, was not so strong as to suggest a
substantial boost to M2 growth from the deposit-rate deregulation on
October 1.1 Marketing of new deregulated accounts has been fairly intense
in the New York area and a few other locales, but on the whole, competition
1. As of October 1, most of the remaining restrictions on small time
deposits with original maturities or notice periods greater than 31 days
were removed. This included the removal of any existing interest rate
ceilings on such deposits.

has been subdued. In this regard, data from a sample of commercial banks
indicate that, on average, rates paid on time accounts since October 1 are
little different from the ceiling rates that would have existed had regula-
tion continued; banks in the Northeast have been offering rates slightly
above the old ceilings, while banks in the rest of the country have been
offering rates slightly below the old ceilings.
Most nontransactions components of M2 grew faster in October than
in September. Evidently, growth rates for MMDAs, savings deposits, and
general purpose and broker/dealer money market fund shares were largely
unaffected by the deregulation of small time deposits. Overnight RPs and
Eurodollars posted an appreciable increase at banks last month; it has
been suggested that some banks have bid a little more aggressively for
these short-dated liabilities in order to achieve desired liability struc-
tures in light of lengthening maturities of core deposits in recent months.
The non-M2 component of M3 was up only slightly in October, after
hefty increases in the preceding few months. Commercial banks sharply
reduced their total managed liabilities, not only running off CDs and term
RPs, but also substantially cutting their net liabilities to foreign
branches. S&L issuance of CDs remained heavy, albeit apparently somewhat
less so than in other recent months.
Domestic bank credit expanded at around a 9-1/2 percent annual rate
in October, considerably faster than in September and close to the aver-
age year-to-date pace. The October acceleration reflected both a pickup
in bank loans and increased net acquisitions of Treasury securities.
Consumer loans accelerated further in October from the rapid pace of the
third quarter, evidently reflecting the enlarged financing requirements

of recent strong consumer spending--especially for automobiles. Real
estate loans increased less rapidly than in other recent months. Although
business loan growth picked up, it continued weak at domestic offices of
large banks, reportedly reflecting more attractive credit terms available
to bigger businesses in the commercial paper market and on LIBOR-based
loans booked at foreign offices.
Business Finance
Although fixed capital and inventory requirements grew considerably
in the third quarter, it appears that profits rose enough to give busi-
ness corporations another financial surplus. The balance now might well
be swinging toward the other side, but firms probably have no more than
a small net need for external funds in the current quarter. With equity
issuance still sizable, debt growth of nonfinancial firms in the aggregate
has been negligible of late. Short-term business debt apparently continued
to grow considerably in October, but gross public bond offerings by non-
financial companies were very light.
The Board's recently offered Aaa utility rate index is about 40
basis points higher than at the time of the last FOMC meeting. At around
12-3/4 percent, the current yield is about 1-3/4 percentage points above
its May 1983 trough and close to its recent August peak. Quality spreads
between corporate and government issues have changed little over the past
two months and remain quite narrow, the spread between yields on Aaa and A
seasoned corporate issues at less than 1/2 percentage point, also remains
very narrow.
Total public offerings of corporate bonds were unchanged in October,
at a seasonally adjusted $3.1 billion. About one third of this volume

III-8
comprised mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by home builders.
The relatively short-term issues of financial organizations such as
Citicorp, GMAC, and Ford Motor Credit made up a large share of the remain-
ing bond volume, while utility and industrial offering totals dwindled
from their already low September levels. Lower-rated firms accounted for
most of the limited number of industrial issues, which generally involved
equity considerations in the form of warrants or stock convertibility
provisions.
After some stock price indexes posted new highs early in October,
they quickly backed off--responding at least in part to the changing
interest rate climate. Gross stock issuance increased to a seasonally
adjusted $3.1 billion in October, a slight increase from September but
more than one third below the unusually large average monthly volume in
the first half of the year. Initial public offerings (IPOs) of stock
accounted for about a third of last month's new stock issuance. There
were 70 IPOs in October, raising the total for the year to about 620, the
largest number of such offerings since 1972; IPO dollar volume has greatly
exceeded earlier annual records. This year's IPO activity has been boosted
by S&L conversions to stock ownership and by spin-offs of corporate
divisions.1
Government Finance
Federal Sector. The Treasury has drawn down the extraordinarily
large $37 billion cash position it had at the end of the third quarter by
reducing planned borrowing in the current quarter. The Treasury recently
1. For example, the recently announced spin-off of Trans World Airlines
from TWA corporation was preceded by an IPO of $85 million of stock in
the newly incorporated airline.

III-9
announced that fourth-quarter marketable borrowings will total about $42
billion, well below the earlier official estimate, but in line with Board
staff projections. The larger underlying federal deficit, however, more
accurately measures the current quarter's absorption of savings from the
private sector.
The failure of Congress to raise the debt ceiling in a timely fash-
ion has substantially altered Treasury borrowing plans for this quarter.
In anticipation of some slight delay in Senate action on the pending bill
to raise the ceiling by about $225 billion,1 the Treasury took steps in
late October and early November to avoid breaching the ceiling. For
example, the sizes of some bill auctions were reduced, other bill and note
auctions were postponed, and sales of savings bonds and other nonmarket-
able issues were suspended. With these maneuverings holding down debt
growth, the Treasury, after initially postponing auctions for its planned
$16 billion midquarter refunding package, was able to reschedule those
auctions for this week.
Net borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies, after being
negative earlier in the year, amounted to $1.7 billion in October but is
expected to be slightly below that monthly level through the rest of the
year. Most of October's net cash borrowing was done by housing-related
agencies: the FHLBs raised $600 million to help fund outstanding advances
and add to their liquidity, and the FHLMC sold $700 million of collater-
alized mortgage obligations.
State and Local Sector. Gross offerings of tax-exempt bonds totaled
1. An increase in the debt ceiling was provided in the budget resolution,
and passage of that resolution constituted action by the House on the
debt ceiling; separate action by the Senate, however, is required.

average in the third quarter. Since midyear, municipal bond volume has
been running substantially below that of the first half when interest

impending registration requirement that went into effect on July 1. Both

In October, as they have since midyear, housing-related issues
accounted for a substantial portion of long-term municipal bond offerings;
such issues accounted for about a third of October's volume, compared with
only 15 percent of average monthly volume in the first half of the year.
In particular, tax-exempt bond issuance to finance single-family mortgages

III-12
has surged in recent months, likely reflecting the year-end expiration
of the legal authority to issue such bonds; however, there are efforts
in the Congress to extend the authority with some modifications.1
Mortgage Markets
Contract interest rates on new commitments for long-term fixed-
rate conventional home mortgages at S&Ls have declined nearly 1/4 percen-
tage point since the last FOMC meeting. In secondary markets, yields on
fixed-rate instruments declined into late October, but have about retraced
this movement since then. As price discounts on GNMA-guaranteed securities
issued against pools of FHA/VA home mortgages bearing the prevailing 13
percent ceiling rate shrank below 2 points, the Administration cut the
ceiling rate to 12-1/2 percent, effective November 1. By November 7,
discounts on securities backed by the 12-1/2 percent loans were about 5
points.
The importance of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) has been picking
up recently, and about 45 percent of conventional loans closed in early
September had adjustable-rate features. (Including FHA/VA loans, all of
which have fixed rates, adjustable-rate loans represented about a third of
total home mortgage loans closed in early September.) The initial rate
1. Legislation to extend mortgage revenue bond authority is contained in
a bill (The Tax Reform Act of 1983) that was recently reported out of the
House Ways and Means Committee. The key provisions of the bill would:
(1) extend the sunset provision for tax-exempt home mortgage revenue
bonds until the end of 1988; (2) give state and local governments the
option of exchanging all or a part of their tax-exempt mortgage bond
authorization for special tax credits that could be passed on to low- and
moderate-income home buyers; and (3) place volume limits on the amount
of tax-exempt industrial development bonds that a state could issue.
The bill as currently formulated, however, has been widely criticized
and is likely to undergo substantial revision before any enactment.

III-13
advantages offered to ARM borrowers by mortgage originators have widened,
largely in reflection of the steepening of the yield curve since early
August. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC--the federally sponsored secondary
market purchasers of mortgages--recently have changed the pricing terms
of their ongoing ARM programs, and they have initiated a number of special
promotional programs that may have encouraged loan orginators to market
ARMs more aggressively and to spur home sellers to buy down initial ARM
rates to exceptionally low levels.
Growth in residential mortgage debt appears to have slowed only a
little thus far, in association with the higher interest rates that pre-
vailed during the third quarter. At S&Ls, new and outstanding mortgage
commitments in September maintained their previous high levels. The in-
crease in total mortgage assets held by S&Ls was $1 billion smaller than
in the preceding month, though, as net acquisitions of pass-through secur-
ities slowed and holdings of cash and other liquid assets were rebuilt.
Issuance of federally guaranteed, pass-through securities continued quite
strong in October; much of this activity is related to the mortgage/secur-
ities swap programs of FNMA and FHLMC.
Recently, private mortgage-backed bonds have emerged as a newly
important source of housing finance, with issuance of these bonds reaching
almost $1 billion in October (see table on page III-6). The recent surge
largely reflects offerings by finance subsidiaries of large home building
companies. The bonds are collateralized by pools of mortgages that have
been made by these subsidiaries to finance sales of homes built by the

are cash-flow or pay-through instruments and have frequently contained
sequential-pay features--providing for slow-pay classes to receive princi-
pal from mortgage repayments only after all faster-pay classes of bonds
have been retired.2
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit apparently continued expanding in
September at about the 11 percent annual rate recorded in August. Some
acceleration is suggested in October by the available data for commercial
banks. Consumer credit began to grow at double-digit annual rates in June
and has continued to outpace the average rate of increase recorded at
comparable stages of most previous postwar business recoveries.
The large recent monthly increments to outstanding consumer credit
have been accompanied by some further easing in new-car loan rates at
commercial banks which, together with the nearly completed phaseout of
rebate subsidy programs offered by finance subsidiaries of domestic auto
manufacturers, has wiped out most of the earlier differential of more
than 2 percentage points between bank rates and rates on subsidized loans
from finance companies. Since the second quarter, as finance company
rate subsidies became increasingly limited to slower-selling models, com-
mercial banks once again began to account for the majority of net new auto
financing.
1. For tax purposes, builders can utilize an installment method of report-
ing income received from the sale of houses financed by mortgages made to
purchasers. This deferral of income tax payments has been a major stimu-
lus to the issuance of so-called "builder" bonds. The Administration has
indicated recently that builder bonds raise some tax-policy concerns.
2. Breaking an issue into maturity slices, tailored to the preferences of
different segments of the investment community, has generally resulted in
somewhat lowered borrowing costs for issuers.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting the dollar has appreciated about 1-1/2
percent, partly in association with increases in dollar interest rates
relative to foreign rates. The differential between the U.S. 90-day CD
rate and a weighted-average of short-term foreign rates has widened by
about 1/8 percentage point since October 3. Increased world political
tensions have also been a factor in the dollar's strength.
On a bilateral basis the mark has depreciated about 1-3/4 percent
against the dollar. On November 2 it was announced that a large West
German bank, Schroder Munchmeyer, Hengst & Co., was experiencing
difficulties and was being rescued by the Bundesbank and other West
German banks, and this development intensified the weakness of the mark
that had emerged earlier.
The pound has appreciated about 1/2 percent against the dollar.
Sterling had fallen sharply between the end of September and early
October, just prior to a 1/2 percentage point reduction in Bank of
England money market dealing rates. It then rose sharply as inflation
expectations decreased on news of negative sterling M3 growth for
September.
In late October the Japanese government introduced a widely-
anticipated economic package. The package was designed to produce a
modest increase in economic growth and imports, and included a reduction
in Japan's discount rate from 5-1/2 to 5 percent. (See the Foreign
Economic Developments section for more detail.) This was the first

Silver prices are now about $9, nearly 15 percent below their
October 3 level and about 25 percent below their mid-September level.
At times since October 3, the price of silver has been even lower. This
dramatic drop is due in part to reports of sales of silver by Peruvian
monetary authorities and the fears of possible additional official sales,
and in part to recent upward revisions in estimates of above-ground
stocks of silver in private hands. Increases in long-term interest rates
have also been a contributing factor. Gold prices have fallen a further
2 percent since the last FOMC meeting, probably because of interest rate
movements and developments in the silver market.

IV-4
International lending by BIS-reporting banks. The claims of BIS
reporting banks on the non-OPEC developing countries increased during the
first half of 1983 by only $6 billion after adjustment for the effects of
exchange rate changes on the stock of such claims, an increase that was
only one-third as large as in the first half of 1982. This reduction in
net new lending was part of a general pattern in which the rate of lending
to most groups of countries in the first half of 1983 was only a small
fraction of that of previous years. The generalized slowing was more
pronounced in the second quarter than the first.
The reporting banks' claims on all borrowers increased only $22
billion in the first half of the year, less than one-third as much as a
year earlier. (All data are on an exchange-rate-adjusted basis.) In the
second quarter the rise came to only $6 billion. Claims on countries in
the reporting area itself (which includes the G-10 countries, Switzerland
and offshore centers) were down 75 percent between the first half of 1982
and the first half of 1983, reflecting sharp reductions in lending both in
the interbank market and to nonbanks. Lending to developed countries
outside the reporting area and to OPEC countries largely disappeared in
the first half of this year.
New lending to the non-OPEC developing countries had already fallen
sharply in the second half of 1982. In the first six months of 1983 new
lending to Latin America, amounting to $4 billion, entirely reflected
drawings on "involuntary" loans to Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. Claims
on Latin America would have risen further if an $0.6 billion bank loan
drawing by Brazil had not been held up because of noncompliance with IMF
targets and if Mexico had not shifted a $1.1 billion bank loan drawing
into the third quarter.

After mid-1982 U.S.-chartered banks reduced their new lending to
the non-OPEC developing countries somewhat more sharply than other
banks. In the 12 months to June 1983 the U.S. banks' share of total new
lending to those countries was one-third, compared with two-thirds in
the first half of 1982 and an average of about 40 percent in earlier
years. The U.S. banks' share of the outstanding claims on the non-OPEC
developing countries in June 1983 was 40 percent.

IV-6
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Data now available on U.S. international transactions during the
third quarter show a $17.9 billion merchandise trade deficit (quarterly
rate). Most of the counterpart financing took the form of a $16.3
billion net capital inflow through U.S. banking offices. (See the
summary table on the next page.) Private foreign purchases of U.S.
corporate stocks and bonds were lower than during the first two
quarters of the year, as were private U.S. purchases of foreign
securities. Private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities
fell to the smallest quarterly level in two years.
Foreign official reserve holdings in the United States declined by
$3.4 billion during the third quarter. OPEC drew down its reserves by
$2 billion, bringing to $7 billion the total reduction this year in
OPEC holdings in the United States. Partial data, based on holdings at
the New York Federal Reserve Bank, show an increase of more than $3
billion in foreign official reserves during October. The holdings of
G-10 countries at the N.Y. Fed increased by nearly $1-1/2 billion in
October, OPEC holdings declined by nearly $1 billion, and the reserves
of all other countries rose by about $2-1/2 billion, mainly reflecting
accumulations by several Pacific Basin countries.
In contrast to the large third-quarter net inflows to U.S.
banking offices from own foreign offices, data for the first four weeks
of October show a $4-1/2 billion net outflow from U.S.-chartered banks
to their own foreign offices. (See the International Banking Data
Table.) About one-third of the net outflow apparently reflected a

U.S. Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in September was somewhat
smaller than the record amount registered in August. Exports
increased in September (particularly corn, machinery and aircraft)
while imports decreased (largely manufactured goods).
For the third quarter as a whole the deficit, $72 billion at an
annual rate, was notably larger than in the second quarter and twice
the size of the first-quarter deficit. Exports increased moderately
but imports grew even more. The exchange value of the dollar rose by 5
percent in the third quarter, and the dollar's strength continues to
affect adversely the price competitiveness of U.S. goods.

One-third of the export rise in the third quarter was in
agricultural shipments (particularly soybeans to Japan and Mexico);
about half the agricultural export rise was in prices. The moderate
increase in nonagricultural exports was spread among such commodity
categories as chemicals, telecommunications equipment, business machines,
automotive products to Canada, and consumer goods. By area, non-
agricultural exports to Western Europe continued to be sluggish in the
third quarter; shipments were at about the same level as in the second
quarter, which was nearly 10 percent less than levels recorded in the
preceding four quarters. The increase in nonagricultural exports was
largely to non-OPEC developing countries (one-third of which was to
Mexico and most of the rest was to countries in the Far East).
Much of the increase in imports in the third quarter was in oil.
The volume increased to a rate of 6.4 million barrels per day (mbd),
seasonally adjusted, from a second-quarter rate of 5.2 mbd (primarily a
response to increased U.S. oil consumption and marginal stock
increases). Oil import prices averaged about $28.30 per barrel, up about
60 cents per barrel from the second quarter. Throughout the third
quarter, import and contract prices continued to edge upward, but spot
prices began to move down in late August and continued to decline in

September and October. OPEC oil production is estimated to have risen
to about 18.2 mbd in the third quarter, up from the announced production
ceiling of 17.5 mbd.
The moderate increase in nonoil imports was largely in response
to a strengthening in the U.S. economy; the rise was concentrated in
manufactured goods including industrial supplies (building materials,
steel, paper), machinery, and automotive products from Japan and Europe
(about half vehicles and half parts.)
Japanese Automotive Export Restrictions
The Japanese government agreed to a fourth year of voluntary
restrictions on their passenger car exports to the United States,
effective April 1, 1984. The limit will be 1.85 million units, up from
1.68 million units in effect during each of the previous three agreement
years.
Japanese auto manufacturers shipped the maximum number of cars in
each of the two past agreement years. Thus far in the current agreement
year, Japanese passenger car shipments to the United States are about 2
percent above shipments made during the same period last year (April 1
through September 30). U.S. sales of Japanese cars have held at a fairly
steady rate during the past five quarters, averaging 1.8 to 2.0 million
units (SAAR) per quarter, and as a result dealer's stocks of new cars have
been drawn down to record low levels. During the past year the average
import price of Japanese cars rose by about 9 percent (3Q83/3Q82).

IV-12
Foreign Economic Developments. The level of industrial production
for the major foreign countries on a trade weighted basis remained above
the year-earlier level in the third quarter, but no general upward
tendency is evident. In Japan, industrial production rose briskly in the
third quarter, while Canadian industrial production continued to rise
through August, although at a more moderate rate than was the case for
the previous two quarters. In Germany and France, however, industrial
production was flat over the most recent three months; and, in the
United Kingdom, it declined slightly in August but was 1.7 percent above
the first quarter average. Italy posted declines in industrial
production for the last two quarters, and it appears that the third
quarter will register a decline as well. Unemployment remained at
historically high rates without a discernible trend in recent months with
the exception of Canada, where the unemployment rate continued its ten-
month decline.
In general, the inflation rates for the major foreign economies
over the first nine months of 1983 were well below the rates established
over the same period in 1982. Recent trends, however, are mixed. While
Italy experienced a reduction in the rate of inflation over the first
three quarters, Germany and Canada experienced increases in their
inflation rates.
In France, the trade balance recently registered a dramatic
improvement; and, Japan and Canada experienced strong trade performances

the third quarter but were down relative to last year. The U.K.
cumulative current account surplus for the first three quarters of this
year was about $1 billion, compared with about $5 billion over the same
period in 1982.
In recent policy developments, Japan announced a package of
measures designed to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports.
These measures include expenditure increases, tax reductions, and a
reduction in the discount rate to 5 percent from 5-1/2 percent. If
effective within a single fiscal year, this package would amount to a
change from the current fiscal stance of approximately 1 percent of GNP
or about 20 percent of the 1982 deficit. In Italy, the government
introduced legislation that is designed to reduce the budget deficit in
1984 as a fraction of GDP to about 15 percent from the current 16 percent
share.
Individual Country Notes. The Japanese authorities recently
have taken steps to accelerate the pace of recovery in Japan and reduce
Japan's growing current-account surplus. On October 28, the Nakasone
government announced a package of measures designed primarily to
stimulate domestic demand and to increase imports. The program includes
expenditure increases of about $8 billion equivalent or about 0.6 percent
of GNP, income-tax reductions of $5 billion or about 0.4 percent of GNP,
and a cut in the discount rate by 50 basis points to 5 percent. Although
the timing of this package is currently uncertain, it would represent a
change from the current fiscal stance of approximately 1 percent of GNP
if enacted in a single fiscal year. In addition, the Japanese announced

IV-17
the establishment of a special low-interest yen-loan facility to provide
financing for imports and an acceleration of previously-agreed-upon
tariff cuts. The authorities also confirmed their intention to issue
government-guaranteed dollar-denominated Japanese governmental agency
bonds on the U.S. capital market and announced additional longer-term
measures aimed at encouraging capital inflow into Japan.
In recent months, the pace of activity in Japan has quickened
somewhat, but evidently, the pick up in activity was not rapid enough to
satisfy Japanese policy makers that their target of 3.4 percent growth
of real GNP in FY 1983 (ending in March) could be met. In the third
quarter, industrial production advanced at a strong 12 percent rate
(s.a.a.r.) to a level about 4 percent above that in 1982-Q3, but labor-
market conditions have remained slack. Inflation in wages and consumer
prices has been well in control. In mid-November the CPI stood 2-1/2
precent above its year-earlier level, and wholesale prices in the third
quarter were 2 percent below the year-ago level.
In Japan's external accounts, large surpluses have continued
to accumulate. Although the September current-account surplus was down
slightly from the July and August levels to $2 billion (s.a.), the
cumulative surplus for the first three quarters was almost $16 billion.
The cumulative trade surplus over this period was over $23 billion.
In Germany, industrial production for September was unchanged from
August, at a level 5 percent above late last year, which marked the
trough of the recession. This gain was made in the first two quarters
followed by stagnation in the third quarter. GNP data for the second

IV-18
quarter show no growth in consumption spending, which had grown
vigorously in the first quarter. Net exports also stagnated. The
strength in the second quarter was in the investment component,
especially construction. The rate of unemployment, at 9.4 percent (s.a.)
in October, remains very high, but has not increased since April.
The rate of inflation, which was negative on a seasonally adjusted
basis earlier this year, has accelerated markedly in recent months.
Consumer prices advanced at an annual rate of 6 percent (s.a.) in the
three months period to September. This recent acceleration is also
evident in import prices -- reflecting in part the strength of the U.S.
dollar -- as well as wholesale and producers' prices. However, the
October CPI was unchanged from its September level.
The current account showed a small deficit in September. Through
September this year, the current account has been in balance, compared
with a $1 billion deficit for the same period of last year. The trade
balance so far this year shows a smaller surplus compared to last year.
The volume of exports has declined significantly, and the improvement in
Germany's terms of trade was insufficient to offset fully the decline in
the real trade balance.
The growth of Central Bank Money slowed somewhat in September, but
the level reached was almost 7 percent above the fourth quarter of last
year. This virtually assures some overshooting of the Bundesbank's
target, which is 4 to 7 percent CBM growth between fourth quarters.
Economic activity in France has remained essentially flat since the
beginning of the year. Real GDP declined by 0.3 percent (s.a.) in the

IV-19
third quarter, returning to the same level as in the fourth quarter of
last year. In August the index of industrial production was unchanged at
a level 4 percent above the year-earlier level. The unemployment rate in
September remained at 8.8 percent (s.a.), unchanged since May.
Consumer prices increased by 0.8 percent (n.s.a.) in September,
raising the year-over-year inflation rate to 10.2 percent. This is the
first time the inflation rate has been in double digits in a year.
Government officials now concede that their 1983 inflation target of 8
percent (December over December) will be exceeded by at least one
percentage point. However, the government's 5 percent inflation target
for 1984 has been reaffirmed.
The most favorable economic development in recent months has been
the continued shrinking of the trade deficit. In September a small trade
surplus of $40 million (s.a.) was actually recorded -- the first monthly
trade surplus in over two years. For the first nine months of 1983 trade
was in deficit at an annual rate of $7.4 billion (s.a.), nearly a halving
of the $14 billion trade deficit recorded last year. The most important
goal of the government's current austerity program is the complete
elimination of the trade deficit by the end of next year.
Real economic activity in the United Kingdom appears to be
continuing to expand, but indicators are mixed. In August the index of
industrial production declined slightly; nevertheless, the three-month
average ending in that month was 0.8 percent above the average for the
previous three months. Retail sales rose sharply in September. In
October, the unemployment rate receded to the August level of 12.3

IV-20
percent after rising to 12.4 percent in September. The rate of inflation
rose again in September. The 12-month percentage change figure was 5.1
percent for the retail price index. This compares to 3.6 percent for the
equivalent measure in June.
In September both the trade and current account balances were in
surplus. The cumulative current account for the first three quarters of
this year posted a surplus of $.85 billion while for the same period the
trade account registered a deficit of $1.9 billion. For the first three
quarters of 1982, these figures were surpluses of $5.3 billion and $1.6
billion, respectively.
In Italy, the recession that commenced late in 1980 is continuing.
Industrial production in the first nine months of this year was about 10
percent below the level of the corresponding period of 1980. Both
official and private forecasts point to a drop of real GDP this year of
about 1-1/2 percent. The recession has been an important factor in the
deceleration of wholesale prices, which rose by 8.7 percent in the 12
months ending in August compared with a 13.2 percent rate in the
corresponding period ending in 1982. Consumer price inflation has also
slowed but remains higher than wholesale price inflation, in part because
of increases in indirect taxes. The recession has also led to a sharp
improvement in the trade account: in the first eight months of this
year, the deficit was about $7 billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with a
$16-1/2 billion deficit in 1982.
On September 30, the Council of Ministers approved and sent to
Parliament financial legislation for 1984 which, if approved, would hold

IV-21
the enlarged public sector deficit (EPSD) to about $61 billion, or about
15 percent of GDP. The EPSD this year is projected to be about $58
billion or about 16 percent of GDP. The legislation would raise revenues
by $13 billion, reduce programmed increases in spending by $9 billion,
and generate other savings of about $7-1/2 billion. The outlook for the
approval of this legislation is uncertain.
In Canada, the recovery continues to appear robust, posting a
seasonally-adjusted gain of 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent in industrial
production for July and August. This followed growth in real GNP of
approximately 7-1/2 percent at an -annual rate for the first two quarters
of 1983. Housing starts dropped again in August for the third
consecutive month; however, they remain over 44 percent above the August
1982 figures. The unemployment rate continued to fall in October, for
the tenth consecutive month, reaching a level of 11.1 percent of the
labor force.
Although the CPI remained unchanged in September over August, there
was an acceleration in inflation from an annualized rate of less than
3 percent in the first quarter to over 6 percent in the third quarter.
Nevertheless, the inflation rate remains well below the double digit
levels recorded in the previous two years.
Canada's trade surplus narrowed to $1 billion in August;
nevertheless, the cumulative trade surplus for the year to date remains
over 4 percent higher than the cumulative total over the corresponding
period in 1982. These trade surpluses, though large by historical
standards, declined each month since April. The expansion of merchandise

IV-22
net exports to the United States is abating although the volume of trade
with the United States is up sharply, particularly in transportation
equipment.
The Debt Problem Situation in Important Developing Countries
Mexico, Chile, and Ecuador are currently operating within their
IMF programs. Argentina and Peru have not met some of the conditions of
their IMF programs, while Brazil and the Philippines have had difficult
negotiations with the Fund on new or modified agreements. Venezuela's
resources are adequate, but its relations with its bank creditors have
been strained by continued interest arrears.
Agreements to restructure about $22.5 billion of Mexico's external
public debts to foreign banks maturing between August 1982 and December
1984 were signed August 26, September 29, and October 25. The terms are
eight years, four years' grace, and interest at 1-7/8 percent over LIBOR
or 1-3/4 percent over prime. The Mexican CPI, which doubled between
December 1981 and December 1982, rose by 3.1 percent in September--the
lowest monthly increase since December 1981. The gradual reduction in
deposit interest rates, initiated in June 1983 to reflect the easing of
the monthly inflation rate, continued in September. The two official
exchange rates for the peso are continuing to be depreciated by 13 cen-
tavos per day and stood at 136.00 and 153.00 pesos per dollar, respec-
tively, at the end of October. In U.S. markets, the peso is trading at
about 159.00 pesos per dollar.
Brazil has signed a new letter of intent with the IMF. However,
the IMF will not act on the revised Brazilian program until November 18
at the earliest since it is not yet clear whether, given the latest

IV-23
Brazilian proposal on wages (decree law 2065) which has passed the
Brazilian Congress, the necessary modifications in other policies can be
agreed upon by November 18. With no new money, Brazil's public sector
arrears (net of central bank cash) were about $2.4 billion by mid-
October. The Brazilians have met the targets specified in the new letter
of intent for public sector borrowing, net domestic assets, net new
external indebtedness, and for the change in net international reserves
in September. However, the inflation rate of 13.3 percent in the month
of October raises questions about the monthly inflation target of 5 per-
cent for the fourth quarter. This large rise in prices can be accounted
for by the effects of the February 1983 maxi-devaluation, increases in
controlled prices (wheat and petroleum products), rapid increases in
food prices, and the recent increases in both the growth of M-1 and in
the velocity of circulation. These inflation developments may result in
the target for the public sector borrowing requirement not being met in
December since it includes both the operational deficits and the
increases in value of assets issued by the government that are indexed.
Despite these recent developments it appears that the bank advisory
committee will be able to obtain commitments (of between 80 and 90 per-
cent) by the banks participating in the $6.5 billion syndication of "new
money" for Brazil. In addition, commitments by official agencies coming
close to $2.0 to $2.5 billion will also have to be forthcoming before
November 18 if the Brazilian request for a waiver and modification of
performance criteria is to go before the Executive Board of the IMF on
that date.

IV-24
An Argentine judge called the September 16 debt restructuring
agreement for Argentine Airlines into question, and the initial $500
million disbursement of a $1.5 billion loan signed in August was delayed
again. Most of the disbursement, which may now take place at the end of
November, would be used to make a $350 million payment on the bridge
loan originally due September 15. Another $130 million would be used to
pay interest arrears for the period up to September 30. Argentina's
August drawing from the IMF continues to be held up pending settlement
of at least a portion of the arrears and waivers on two technical
matters--the temporary use of a subsidy on automobile exports, which
represents a multiple currency practice, and the use of exchange con-
trols since September 30. If these matters can be resolved and if
Argentina is found to have met the quantitative limits on the net domes-
tic assets of the central bank at least as of the end of September, the
drawing may take place November 15. But the IMF program will have to be
renegotiated if Argentina wishes to have access to the November and
February installments of the stand-by agreement. This is because meas-
ures announced in September and October have made compliance with the
fourth-quarter performance criteria of the IMF program virtually impos-
sible. These measures include increased government spending, suspension
of increases in rates for public services, a tax cut, and generous
increases in wages, pensions, and fringe benefits. In addition, the
monthly rate of depreciation of the official exchange rate for the peso
has fallen behind the monthly rate of inflation each month since June,
and interest rates on 30-day loans and deposits, which were supposed to
vary in line with price increases, were not increased in October and

IV-25
will not be increased in November even though the relevant price index
called for them to be raised by three or four percentage points.
Venezuela has just been granted another (the fourth) moratorium
on public sector debt payments, until January 31. The floating exchange
rate depreciated sharply from 11.2 bolivars per dollar on July 1 to 16.8
bolivars per dollar on August 10, before stabilizing at 13 per dollar in
September and October. The exchange rate was 4.3 bolivars per dollar
until late February. Under a Presidential decree of September 26,
interest payments on private, non-commercial foreign debt are allowed at
the preferential exchange rate of 4.3 bolivars per dollar until December
31, 1983. This will help to reduce private sector interest arrears
which are estimated at about $400 million.
Peru has fallen out of compliance with its IMF program as a
result of a widening fiscal deficit, largely due to the natural dis-
asters which have struck the country. Further adjustment measures will
be needed in order for Peru to restore its ability to draw under the
program, and before banks will make the remaining disbursements total-
ling $200 million of the $450 million credit signed in June. The
government has expressed its intention to seek another Paris Club
rescheduling in 1984 and to ask bank creditors to reschedule $400
million in principal payments coming due in 1984 and early 1985.
Chile and its creditor banks had expected to complete by the end
of October negotiations on the restructuring of $3.4 billion of debt
coming due in 1983 and 1984, but the signing has been delayed as some
details remain to be worked out. Chile drew $500 million of a $1.3
billion bank loan on August 31, another $570 million on September 30,

IV-26
and will be eligible to draw another $230 million at the end of the year.
A $400 million bridge loan from the BIS has been repaid.
The Philippines and the IMF are engaged in negotiation as of this
writing, and an agreement on a stabilization program is expected soon.
Since the mid-term review of progress under the February 1983 stand-by
arrangement has not yet been completed, the Philippines has not yet
drawn the SDR 130 million that was to have been available in two tranches
in August and early November. International reserves dropped from $1.7
billion at mid-year to $286 million in late October, reflecting the con-
tinuing current account deficit, capital flight associated with politi-
cal uncertainties, and an apparent curtailment of foreign bank financing.
The peso was devalued 21.4 percent on October 5, from 11 to 14 pesos to
the dollar, and on October 14 the Philippines requested a 90-day mora-
torium on the repayment of principal on non-trade external debt to com-
mercial banks, to avoid a further loss of liquidity while a financing
plan is being formulated. A rescheduling of debt coming due during the
rest of 1983 and 1984 is being considered. In other actions, a 60-day
freeze was imposed on October 7 on all prices and wages, and commercial
bank reserve requirements are to be increased from 20 percent to 23
percent in two steps effective November 1 and December 1. Effective
November 4, Philippine commercial banks are required to sell 100 percent
of their foreign exchange receipts to the Central Bank.
