The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity has continued to expand strongly in the fourth
quarter, although less rapidly than in the spring and summer. Industrial
production and employment posted further gains in November, and the un-
employment rate fell to its lowest level in two years. Retail sales
rose briskly in October and November, and investment spending is still
trending up; housing activity, however, has slipped back in recent months.
Recent price advances have been larger than the exceptionally small
increases recorded early in the year.
Industrial Production
Industrial production increased 0.8 percent in November, the same
as the October advance. Output of business equipment and materials
continued to rise rapidly in November. However, production of consumer
goods was up only slightly last month, as output of home goods (mainly
appliances) declined and auto assemblies, at a 7.5 million unit annual
rate, were unchanged from October. Output of construction supplies
also was little changed from the October level. With data now available
through November, it appears that industrial production for the fourth
quarter as a whole is rising almost two-thirds as fast as in the two
preceding quarters.
The capacity utilization rate for manufacturing rose to 78.9
percent in October and increased about 1/2 percentage point further in
November. The utilization rate has risen about 10 percentage points
from the recession low of last November, but is still below the 1967-82
II-1

II-2
average. An exception to the general pattern is the paper industry, in
which capacity utilization rates are already close to their pre-recession
peaks. Rates in the electrical machinery industry also are above their
longer-run averages.
Employment and Unemployment
Nonfarm payroll employment rose another 370,000 in November; the
advance was spread across most sectors, with particularly large increases
in manufacturing and services. Since the cyclical trough late last year,
employment growth rates in both the nonfarm sector as a whole and in manu-
facturing have been close to the average for the first year of previous
postwar recoveries.
In manufacturing, the recent data show that firms, in boosting
output, are beginning to rely somewhat more heavily on increased hiring
or rehiring and less on lengthened work schedules. Employment gains in
manufacturing averaged about 150,000 in the past two months, more than in
most previous months of the recovery; the factory workweek, meanwhile,
has edged down in each of the past two months, retracing a bit of its
earlier steep climb. These patterns of change in hours and employment
are fairly common as the economy moves beyond its initial recovery
phase and as firms become more convinced that sales gains are likely
to be sustained.
As measured by the household survey, employment increased 740,000 in
November after showing little change in October, and the unemployment rate
dropped another 0.4 percentage point to 8.4 percent--nearly 2-1/2 per-
centage points below its peak of last December. So far, the strengthening

of labor demand in this recovery has not prompted a major influx of new
jobseekers to the labor force; indeed, the labor force participation
rate in November was slightly below its year-earlier level. Consequently,
the rise in employment this year has been accompanied by a rapid decline
in the number of unemployed workers, with jobless rates down sharply for
almost all worker groups.
Consumer Spending and Personal Income
The growth in consumer spending, which slowed during the summer,
has shown renewed vigor recently. Retail sales rose 1.9 percent in
November, following increases of 1.4 percent in each of the two previous
months. Most major types of stores contributed to the November advance;
outlays for largely discretionary items such as general merchandise and
apparel were particularly strong. November sales for the GAF grouping-
general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliances--were about
3-1/2 percent above the third-quarter average.
Total auto sales were at a 9.7 million unit annual rate in November,
little changed from October but about a half million units above the
third-quarter selling pace. Sales of domestic units, at just over a 7
million unit rate in the past two months, were up only slightly from the
third-quarter average; however, sales of imported cars in October and
November averaged more than 2.6 million units at an annual rate, the
strongest selling pace since early 1981. Sales of Japanese cars in November
fell back somewhat from the October level, with the decline about offset
by a substantial increase in European car sales. Since the beginning of the
Japanese quota year in April, the sales rate of Japanese cars has been

running ahead of Japan's annual limitation on exports to the United States,
implying a future slowing of such sales.
Growth in nominal personal income was well maintained in October,
at about a 14 percent annual rate. A rapid advance in wages and salaries
partly reflected an increase in payrolls associated with the ending of
the telephone strike; however, even adjusting for strike effects, the
October rise in private payrolls was slightly greater than in most recent
months. Real disposable income rose about 5 percent from October 1982 to
October 1983; in contrast, gains in real income over the three previous
years had averaged only 1-1/4 percent per year. Growth in nominal private
wages and salaries appears to have slowed in November, as a small decline
in the average workweek and unchanged hourly earnings offset the continued
growth in employment.
Consumers continue to report optimistic views of their own financial
situations and of the economy in general, according to November surveys
conducted by the Michigan Survey Research Center and the Conference
Board. The latest figures show that consumer confidence remains in the
same high range reported since last spring; measures of consumer spending
intentions, though down slightly from a few months ago, remain at favor-
able levels. The Michigan survey also indicates that consumers expect
prices to rise 5.2 percent over the next 12 months, in line with the
October survey but up about 1/2 percentage point from the expectations
expressed around midyear.

Business Fixed Investment
Although some indicators of current investment spending weakened
in October, the cumulative data of recent months still point to a strong
uptrend in capital spending in the near-term.
In the equipment sector, new orders for nondefense capital goods
recorded strong gains in September and October, and the backlog of unfilled
orders rose sharply in both months. Shipments of nondefense capital
goods fell 3 percent in October to a level just a little above the third-
quarter average; however, in light of the continued strength in new
orders, the drop in shipments is probably transitory. Sales of heavy
trucks rebounded in October to a level slightly above their third-quarter
average.
Spending for nonresidential construction fell 2 percent in October,
reversing the previous month's gain. The decline was concentrated in in-
dustrial building, which fell 20 percent; spending for other types of con-
struction was little changed from September. After falling significantly
through the first half of the year, nonresidential construction has sta-
bilized since June, and an uptrend in permits for new private nonresidential
buildings in the past two quarters portends some support for construc-
tion activity in coming months. Two investment sectors that had remained
weak in the early stages of the recovery--oil drilling and nonoffice
commercial building--have both strengthened significantly in recent months.
The most recent Commerce Department survey of capital spending
anticipations indicates that nonfarm businesses plan to increase nominal
outlays for plant and equipment at a 7 percent annual rate in the first

half of 1984, about half the pace planned for the second half of this
year. The Commerce Department results are slightly weaker than the
spending intentions implied in private surveys conducted earlier this
fall; the November Commerce survey, however, usually has not been a very
reliable indicator of actual investment outlays.
Inventory Investment
After an unusually long period of liquidation, nonfarm businesses
expanded inventories somewhat in the third quarter, and further inventory
accumulation has been evident in the current quarter. Nevertheless, the
rise in inventories has been generally in line with shipments, and inventory-
sales ratios in most industries have remained stable in recent months, at
or below their pre-recession levels. Compared with other postwar business
cycles, the liquidation of stocks persisted longer into the expansion
phase of the current cycle, and thus far, the rebuilding of stocks has
not proceeded as rapidly as in most previous recoveries.
In the manufacturing sector, producers reduced the constant dollar
value of their inventories more than 7 percent from mid-1981 to mid-1983,
and the rebuilding of stocks during the third quarter retraced less than
one-tenth of that liquidation. Real inventories probably remained quite
lean through the end of October, as the book value of factory stocks was

by auto dealers has been rising since midyear, total dealer stocks at the
end of November are not excessive, and inventories of the larger, currently
more popular models were still relatively low. Nonauto trade establishments
appeared to be well stocked, a situation consistent with the reportedly
high sales expectations. In October, total nonauto trade inventories rose
at an annual rate of $21.5 billion in book value terms, as a sharp
accumulation in wholesale stocks was partially offset by a drawdown in nonauto
retail inventories.
Housing Markets
Housing activity has weakened in recent months. Total private
housing starts fell 4 percent during October to a 1.6 million unit annual
rate--down from a 1.8 million unit average for the third quarter. Starts
of single-family units in October were at the lowest rate since early
1983, and multifamily starts in the past two months have been down consid-
erably from the exceptionally high levels of the summer. However, there
are indications that activity may be stabilizing around the current, lower
level; in particular, issuance of building permits firmed in October, and
new homes sales have increased in each of the past two months.
Despite the recent downturn in new construction and the persistence
of high real interest rates, housing activity still is well above the
depressed levels of 1982. This strength can be attributed in part to the
availability of mortgage credit below the market rate for long-term home
loans; heavy issuance of mortgage revenue bonds has provided many home
buyers with subsidized credit, and "creative-financing" techniques de-
signed to reduce monthly payments are still common in real estate markets.

In addition, the increased use of adjustable rate mortgages--now typically
discounted up to nearly 200 basis points over comparable fixed-rate
credit--also has helped to contain initial mortgage costs for many homebuyers.
Government Spending--Federal, State, and Local
Because of slower growth in outlays and stronger growth in receipts,
federal budget deficits in September and October were slightly below year-
earlier levels. Spending for unemployment insurance and other income
support programs has slowed substantially during the recovery, and CCC
inventory accumulation has been curtailed by reductions in farm output
and increases in farm crop prices. Defense spending, which had been
expected to grow very rapidly this year, has risen only slightly faster
than outlays in general. In contrast, spending has risen especially
rapidly for health programs, transportation (as mandated by the Jobs
Bill and Surface Transportation Act), and interest payments on the
federal debt.
Federal receipts in October were 11-1/2 percent above a year
earlier. The effect of a rise in personal incomes over the past twelve
months of the recovery has more than offset the impact of the midyear cut in
individual withholding rates; corporate profits taxes also have shown a
strong cyclical rebound.
Congress adjourned in November with action on 1984 appropriation
bills almost completed. Of 13 regular bills, 10 have been enacted, and a
continuing resolution is providing funding for the remaining agencies and
programs. However, action on reconciliation instructions in the first

budget resolution, which called for tax increases and cuts in entitlement
spending, was not completed.
Purchases of goods and services by state and local governments, in
real terms, rose at nearly a 5 percent annual rate in the third quarter,
with about three-fourths of that gain representing increased outlays for
structures. However, construction spending declined in October, reversing
part of the gains of earlier months, and employment at state and local
governments, though up in November, is only slightly above the second-
quarter average.

II-16
Exports and Imports
A slow expansion in exports is still exerting a drag on real growth,
but at the same time, stable import prices are helping to damp domestic
price inflation.
Imports have continued to grow faster than exports in recent
months, reflecting the strong recovery in the United States, sluggish
activity abroad, and the persistent high level of the exchange value of
the dollar. The merchandise trade deficit reached a new record high in
October--$95 billion at an annual rate. The rise in imports, to a level
nearly 10 percent above the third quarter average, was widespread across
commodity groups. Exports in October were at about the third-quarter
average.
The average price of nonoil imports, which declined steadily from
the second quarter of 1982 through the second quarter of 1983, rose
only fractionally in the third quarter. Oil import prices, also up
slightly in the third quarter, have retraced only part of a second quarter
decline. (A more complete discussion of international economic develop-
ments is included in Part IV.)
Prices
Recent price increases, overall, have continued to be above the
exceptionally low rates of early 1983. The consumer price index rose at
a 5-1/4 percent annual rate in October, about in line with advances of
the three previous months; increases in producer prices in recent months,
though still quite moderate, also have tended to be somewhat larger than
in the early part of the year.

II-17
Excluding food and energy, the CPI has been rising at about a 6
percent annual rate in recent months, reflecting some pickup in infla-
tion rates for both commodities and services. Among these items, recent
increases in consumer prices have been especially large for new and used
cars. The price advances for new cars--about 0.8 percent per month
during the past three months--have been associated with the accelerated
introduction of new models this year. Price hikes for used cars--at about
a 20 percent annual rate over the past six months--have been concentrated
among the popular larger models that apparently have been in short supply.
Consumer food prices accelerated further in October to a 5-3/4
percent annual rate, mainly reflecting large price hikes for fresh vege-
tables and oilseed products--supplies of which were adversely affected
by the summer drought. At the farm level, prices were relatively stable
through most of the autumn; however, the prices of cattle and hogs, which
were depressed in recent months by high levels of marketings, have turned
up sharply in early December.
An easing of consumer energy prices in October helped offset some
of the price increases in other sectors. Gasoline prices turned down after
rising in each of the preceding six months, and natural gas prices also
declined. Fuel oil price increases slowed, reflecting mild weather dur-
ing the autumn and higher levels of stocks.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage increases for production workers have, on balance, remained
relatively moderate in recent months. The hourly earnings index, which
covers wages paid to four-fifths of the workers on private nonfarm payrolls,

was unchanged in November after rising about 1/2 percent in October.
Thus, on average, wage increases this fall have been about the same as
the 3-1/2 percent annual rate posted over the first 11 months of the
year. Recent wage changes have been especially small in manufacturing
and construction--industries in which wage freezes and pay cuts were
numerous earlier in the year. Concession bargaining this fall has occurred
primarily in airlines, shipbuilding, and intercity bus transportation.
Nonsupervisory workers in trade, services, and finance have received
increases averaging around 4 percent this year.
Revised data indicate that labor productivity rose at about a
3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, somewhat less than the
average gain in the first two quarters but still well above the estimated
long-run rate of growth. The strong productivity rebound, coupled with a
slowdown in wage inflation, has held the rise in unit labor costs to just
1-1/2 percent over the past year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1 was little changed again in November, as demands for liquid
deposits in general continued light. M2 growth, at a 7-3/4 percent
annual rate, was sustained by further strong inflows to its less liquid
small time deposit component. M3 meanwhile accelerated sharply, as banks
expanded managed liabilities to offset a massive runoff of government
deposits. The monetary aggregates all remained within their long-run
ranges in November, but M1 and M3 were within fractions of a point of the
lower and upper ends, respectively, of their ranges.
During the intermeeting period, the federal funds rate generally
continued to fluctuate within or close to the 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent
range that has prevailed since August. Other short-term interest rates
increased about 30 to 40 basis points, on balance, as evidence of
continued strength of the recovery exerted a negative influence on market
expectations. Although long-term bond rates increased somewhat less than
short-term rates, the yield curve remains quite steep.
The aggregate debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated
to have grown at a relatively moderate pace in November, owing in part
to delays in Treasury borrowing occasioned by the federal debt ceiling
battle. With the passage of a higher ceiling, federal government borrow-
ing has picked up again in December. Faster debt growth this month has
been prompted also by congressional inaction on legislation relating to
various types of tax-exempt financing; led by a surge in mortgage revenue
bond issues, tax-exempt bond offerings in December have hit a torrid
pace and have pushed up rates in this market. Although it appears that
business cash flows may now be rising less rapidly than outlays, external

financing by firms has remained light. Net extensions of consumer credit
rebounded early in the fourth quarter, but the rate of mortgage formation
appears to be continuing to slow, with interest rates on new commitments
registering little change.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 barely expanded in November, marking the fourth consecutive month
of sluggishness in that aggregate. M1 has risen at slightly more than a
5 percent annual rate from its second-quarter 1983 target base, leaving
its November average just above the lower boundary of its monitoring
range. The weakness in M1 in November again was concentrated in checkable
deposits. Demand deposits fell for the fourth consecutive month, leaving
the level of this component about $4 billion below the monthly average peak
reached in July, while other checkable deposits showed only moderate gains
in November. Currency growth remained relatively rapid, dropping just
below its recent 10 percent rate; growth in currency has averaged more
than 10 percent since the fourth quarter of last year, a bit above
econometric model predictions.
Ml velocity will show a sharp increase in the current quarter,
following small increases in the previous two quarters. Even though this
increase in velocity probably will exceed the average for the fourth quarter
of a recovery, growth of velocity over the four quarters since the November
1982 trough will remain substantially below the postwar average for the
first year of business cycle expansions.1
Growth of M2 slowed somewhat in November, leaving the aggregate in
1. A perspective on growth of money and credit and changes in velocity
during 1983 is contained in appendix A.

III-4
the lower half of its target range. Expansion of M2 in November continued
to be driven by rapid growth in small time deposits; since July, growth in
such deposits has been at more than a 20 percent annual rate and has
exceeded the expansion in M2. Overnight RPs and Eurodollars fell in
November after a sharp October advance, in part reflecting the reclassifi-
cation of such instruments from overnight to term over two non-national
holidays in November. MMDAs declined again at thrifts but continued their
moderate growth at commercial banks.
Limited evidence continues to suggest that M2 was not substantially
boosted by the removal on October 1 of most remaining restrictions on small
time deposits. Growth of these deposits in October and November was not
appreciably greater than in the June-September period. Although signifi-
cant increases in small time deposits did occur in districts where the
deregulated accounts were promoted heavily (specifically, New York and
San Francisco), these inflows were associated with outflows of a similar
magnitude from MMDAs and savings accounts. Available data do not yet
permit a breakdown of flows into individual types of deposits, but a review
of nationwide promotional activity indicates that six-month certificates
were advertised heavily in New York.
M3 accelerated to a 12-1/2 percent rate in November, as the non-M2
components of M3 moved up strongly. Much of the increase in M3 growth
resulted from a dramatic drop in government deposits and a consequent
heavier reliance by depository institutions on managed liabilities. An
increase in term RPs in November substantially exceeded the holiday-
related fall in overnight RPs and Eurodollars, included in M2. Commercial
banks also boosted outstanding large CDs for the first time in a year,

III-5
while thrift institutions continued to issue CDs at a brisk, albeit slower,
pace. Finally, banks tapped their foreign branches for $9 billion of funds
not included in M3.
Growth of commercial bank credit strengthened in November to a
13-1/2 percent annual rate, the most rapid pace since January.1 Acquisi-
tions of U.S. government securities remained relatively sizable while other
investments stayed about flat. Consumer loans continued to expand briskly
in November but fell short of the extraordinary October pace. Growth in
real estate loans about matched the 11 percent rate of October, and busi-
ness lending at domestic offices picked up, while loans booked at foreign
branches fell after a couple of months of strong increases.2
Business Finance
The staff's forecast for the current quarter suggests that, for the
first time in the economic recovery, outlays of nonfinancial corporations
on inventories and fixed capital are exceeding internal cash flows.
Nonetheless, available data suggest no pickup in external financing,
implying an abatement of.liquid asset accumulation. At the same time,
business borrowing has continued to be concentrated in the short-term
area. The sum of business loans (excluding acceptances) at commercial
banks and their foreign branches and commercial paper of nonfinancial
business grew at about a 9 percent rate in October and November following
smaller increases in the third quarter and a net decline during the first
half of the year. Meanwhile, the volume of funds raised by nonfinancial
1. A portion of the acceleration in total loans and, thus, bank credit
reflects an abnormally large end-of-month increase in the "other loan"
category at branches and agencies of foreign banks.

of Terms of Bank Lending are discussed in appendix B.

firms in long-term markets has remained low. Industrial firms offered
a total of only $400 million of bonds in the domestic public market in
October and November combined, compared with an average monthly pace of
$1.8 billion in the first half of the year. Despite relatively high levels
of share prices, equity offerings by nonfinancial firms also have slackened
in comparison with the record pace earlier in 1983.
New-issue activity in the corporate bond market has been dominated
by financial firms. During October and November, such firms accounted for
nearly three quarters of total issuance. Sales of GNMA- and mortgage-
collateralized bonds continued to soar, bringing such offerings this year,
through November, to $4 billion. These securities are liabilities either
of finance subsidiaries of residential construction companies or of large
securities firms; many include different classes of issues distinguished
by the speed with which repayment is likely to occur, thus reducing inves-
tors' uncertainty with regard to the duration and actual yield of the
security.
Corporate bond yields have increased by about the same amount as
yields on Treasury securities since the November FOMC meeting. Spreads
of Aaa-rated utility bonds over Treasuries have remained near the lower
end of the range experienced during recent years, as have quality spreads
within the corporate bond and commercial paper markets. Stock prices
are about unchanged, on balance, since the last FOMC meeting. However,
the NYSE composite is 4 percent below its 1983 high, and the AMEX and
NASDAQ composites are down still more (10 and 15 percent, respectively),
reflecting the relatively weaker performance in recent months of shares
in smaller or more speculative companies.

Government Finance
Federal sector. The staff projects a fourth-quarter combined federal
deficit of about $63 billion. However, marketable borrowing is expected
to total only $35 billion, as the Treasury has run down its cash balance
sharply from the outsized end-of-September level. Nearly all of this
borrowing has been conducted in the coupon sector. Contrary to the expec-
tations of many market analysts, the Treasury only recently increased the
gross size of its weekly auctions of three- and six-month bills beyond
the $12.4 billion level reached months ago. These actions, though, are
consistent with the Treasury's stated intention to extend the average
maturity of its debt.
Congressional delays in raising the debt ceiling disrupted Treasury
financial management in November. The Treasury was forced to postpone
or cancel a number of debt auctions and to suspend sales of nonmarketable
issues, and its cash balance was drawn down to precariously low levels. A
new statutory debt ceiling was set at $1.49 trillion effective November 21,
1983, and the Treasury subsequently raised $20.7 billion of new cash in
less than ten days through issuance.of marketable debt and resumed sales
of nonmarketable debt. The staff estimates that the new debt limit will
be reached in mid-April.1
Federally sponsored credit agencies raised $400 million of new
1. The Treasury recently announced that securities to be acquired through
noncompetitive tenders could not be traded in the pre-auction market, in
order to reinforce its limit on the maximum award to any one noncompeti-
tive bidder. In the past, institutions have bypassed the stated maximum,
obtaining securities through noncompetitive tenders submitted by several
of their branches or employees. Since the change in policy, the volume of
noncompetitive tenders submitted in most Treasury auctions has dropped
sharply.

of debentures in that month to finance portfolio purchases of mortgages
thus remaining the major borrower in the agency market. The FHLBs paid
down about $700 million of debt, reflecting a similar reduction in
advances.
State and local sector. Gross offerings of long-term tax-exempt
bonds totaled $4.6 billion (seasonally adjusted) in November, somewhat
below the October volume. The lower volume of offerings resulted in part
from a falloff in refunding issues in November, reflecting the unavail-
ability for much of the month of nonmarketable Treasury state and local
government securities, which are used by the issuing entities as temporary
investments until the securities being refunded mature. Sales of
tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds also dropped below October's pace, but

offerings of these bonds have picked up sharply in December. Statutory
authority to offer them expires at the end of 1983. Although it is widely
expected that mortgage revenue bond issuance will be reauthorized by
Congress when it reconvenes next year, such action is not guaranteed;
thus, borrowers are rushing to market this month to ensure the tax-exempt
status of their offerings.
It is also anticipated that next year Congress will impose new
restrictions on the issuance of most private-purpose tax-exempt bonds,
including industrial development and student loan bonds. State-by-state
volume caps on issuance of private-purpose bonds might be set; in addition,
restrictions relating to arbitrage, depreciation methods, and uses of
funds might be imposed. Even though the legislation would not be enacted
until sometime in 1984, the restrictions could be imposed retroacti-
vely, applying to the entire calendar year. Thus, many issuers are striving
to bring such debt to market this month while legislative authority remains
most favorable.
Increases in yields on municipal revenue bonds have matched those
on corporate bonds since the last FOMC meeting, as dealer inventories and
visible supply have built to unusually high levels. In early December
(latest available), the Bond Buyer revenue bond index stood at 10.45 per-
cent, up 27 basis points from its level at the time of the November FOMC
meeting; the Bond Buyer general obligation index rose only 16 basis points
over the same period, to 9.91 percent.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates in both primary and secondary mortgage markets have
changed little since the last FOMC meeting, ending the downtrend in rates

III-13
that occurred during late summer and early autumn. For 30-year, fixed-rate
conventional home mortgages at S&Ls, the average contract rate on new
commitments dipped 9 basis points to 13.38 percent, and has remained in a
narrow band near 13.4 percent for six weeks. Price discounts on current-
coupon GNMA-guaranteed securities edged downward to 4-3/4 points, and the
VA ceiling rate remained at the 12-1/2 percent level set on November 1.
As a result of recent legislation, FHA ceiling rates, as well as limits on
the number of points borrowers may pay on FHA loans, were eliminated effec-
tive December 1.1 In early December, HUD's regular weekly survey of
mortgage companies indicated that the contract rate being negotiated most
often on FHA-insured loans was 12-1/2 percent.
The yield differential between current-coupon GNMAs and 10-year
Treasury securities has narrowed significantly since August, dropping from
152 basis points to 112 basis points in early December--the lowest spread
in nearly three years. The narrowing of the GNMA spread apparently reflects
both reduced market uncertainty about the timing of prepayments--and thus
reduced uncertainty of realized yield--in response to lower interest rate
variability, and increased use of GNMAs as collateral for bonds issued by
builders and securities firms.
The greater stability of interest rates may have helped alleviate
some of the aversion borrowers have had toward adjustable-rate home mort-
gages (ARMs). The Federal Home Loan Bank Board's monthly survey indicates
that a record 59 percent of conventional loans closed at S&Ls in early
November, and 50 percent at all lenders, had adjustable-rate features.
1. These changes, authorized by the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act
of 1983, eliminated all rate ceilings on FHA-insured mortgages except for
the section 235 subsidy program.

The greater use of ARMs may also be related to increased aggressiveness on
the part of lenders in pricing such loans, which may in turn reflect both
thrifts' efforts to restructure balance sheets and FNMA's and FHLMC's
recent changes in pricing terms and increased promotional activity.
Mortgage commitment activity at S&Ls slowed noticeably in October,
perhaps as a result of earlier increases in rates. Net acquisitions of
mortgage assets also dropped substantially below the elevated summer pace
but remained relatively strong; all of this decline represents a falloff
in net mortgage acquisitions, as holdings of mortgage-backed securities
increased by the same amount as in September. Be that as it may, mortgage
commitments outstanding at S&Ls were at a record high at the end of Octo-
ber, indicating that S&L mortgage acquisitions should be fairly well main-
tained in the near term even without a further decline in mortgage rates.
Issuance of federally guaranteed pass-through securities reached a
1983 low in November. The decline was associated with reductions in both
GNMA issues and mortgage/securities swaps under FNMA and FHLMC programs.
GNMA issue volume was swollen in early and mid-1983 by refinancings of
FHA/VA mortgages prompted by the large decline in mortgage rates that
extended from mid-1982 until May of this year. Since then, the net backup
of rates has discouraged refinancings as well as home sales.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit outstanding rebounded in
October, following two months in which it had slackened from the rapid
pace of early summer. The 16 percent annualized rate of expansion in
October was double the September advance, and well ahead of the 12 percent
growth rate for the full third quarter. Judging from continued heavy

consumer borrowing at commercial banks in November, large increases in
retail store credit, and maintenance of a relatively strong auto sales
pace, it appears likely that consumer credit experienced a further sharp
gain in November.
The decline in interest rates on consumer loans that occurred
earlier this year evidently has sustained households' willingness to incur
additional debt. Recent vigor in consumer borrowing, of course, also has
reflected the improvement in personal income and employment which has
stimulated consumer spending. Borrowing has been supported, too, by a
relatively healthy household sector balance sheet, a result of substantial
additions to assets since early 1982, increased equity values, and only
limited debt buildup during the three years prior to 1983.
Recent data for delinquency rates on consumer loans (see chart on
page III-18) confirm that households have been handling payments on this
type of debt remarkably well. The delinquency rate on closed-end consumer
loans at banks declined to a 10-year low in the third quarter, while delin-
quencies at the automobile finance companies were at their lowest rate
since reporting was begun in 1967. Delinquency rates on home mortgage
loans--which had remained around record highs earlier this year--also
showed declines in the third quarter. Moreover, personal bankruptcies,
though quite volatile on a monthly basis, have traced an unmistakable
downward trend since the end of last year. The total number of filings in
the third quarter was down 1-1/2 percent from the previous quarter and was
9 percent below the year-ago total.

APPENDIX A*
MONETARY AGGREGATES AND DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT IN 1983
Growth in the monetary aggregates was uneven over 1983, with
expansion of both M1 and M2 surging to record rates in the first
half of the year before slowing later in the year. M3 expanded more
steadily, in part reflecting adjustments by banks of their managed
liabilities to accommodate the more stable pace of bank credit.
However, even M3 appears to have been strengthened early in the year
by massive MMDA inflows, the major factor behind the rapid growth in
M2 at that time.
M1 expanded at a 13-3/4 percent annual rate from the last quar-
ter of 1982 through June. Growth then slowed to a 3 percent annual
rate over the next five months. As was the case in 1982, M1 behavior
this year has been dominated by its OCD component. Through November,
OCDs had expanded at nearly a 30 percent annual rate, just below their
1982 pace, but most of this growth took place in the first half of the
year. Indeed, in the September-November period this component slowed
to a 2 percent annual rate--the first instance of sustained weakness
since these deposits were authorized nationwide at the end of 1980.
Demand deposits actually contracted in each of the four months ending
with November and over the first 11 months of the year increased at
only a 1-1/2 percent rate. Currency growth over this period was
comparatively steady and averaged 10 percent.
Growth in OCDs this year was more than accounted for by inflows
to Super NOWS. These accounts were authorized in early January, and
by November they had attracted $36-1/2 billion, predominately from
regular NOW accounts.1 As of November, Super NOWs constituted more
than 25 percent of OCDs, while the share of M1 accounted for by total
OCDs rose by about 3 percent this year to just under 25 percent.
M1 growth in the first three quarters of 1983 exceeded predic--
tions of econometric models of money demand, even those specified to
incorporate the lagged impact of the very large percentage decline in
the opportunity cost of regular NOW accounts that accompanied market
rate declines in the second half of 1982. In recent months, however,
actual M1 growth has fallen below predicted rates, as expansion in its
deposit components has stagnated. M1 velocity, which had exhibited
unusual weakness in 1982, continued to decline in the first quarter
but increased slightly in the second quarter and grew further further
in the third. However, even with a strong acceleration in the current
1. To some small degree, M1 growth in early 1982 was boosted by non-M1
funds attracted to Super NOW accounts; however, this impact is believed
to have been about offset by M1 funds shifted to MMDAs.

quarter, M1 velocity growth in the full year since the fourth quarter
of 1982 business cycle trough will be well below the typical recovery
experience: about 1-1/4 percent versus a median of 6-1/2 percent
during the first year of upturns since 1949.
Although earlier interest rate declines are estimated to have
strongly influenced M1 growth in the first part of 1983, the back-up
in rates during the year helped to slow expansion in the second half
and, on balance, rate movements contributed somewhat less to money
growth in 1983 than in 1982. The declining inflation rate, too,
suggested a deceleration in M1 in 1983, and the Board's quarterly
model attributes the pickup in M1 growth this year almost entirely
to the swing from economic contraction to strong real economic growth
between 1982 and 1983. In addition, the acceleration of predicted M1
was a bit faster than that of actual Ml, reducing somewhat the pre-
diction error this year relative to last, as predicted growth fell
short of actual growth in both years.
Monetary flows in 1983 were dominated by MMDAs, authorized as of
mid-December 1982. With initial offering rates well above the market,
the response to this innovation was dramatic; inflows in January
alone totalled about $146 billion and by March oustandings had reached
$320 billion. Depositories rapidly reduced offering rates in the wake
of this response. Since June, MMDAs have remained roughly unchanged
at around $367 billion, or about 17 percent of M2. In addition to
profoundly rearranging M2--by June savings, small time deposits and
general purpose/broker dealer MMMFs had declined from November 1982
levels by, respectively, 11-1/4, 17-1/2 and 27 percent--this new
instrument also attracted substantial funds from non-M2 sources.
About 85 percent of MMDAs are personal. At banks, which hold about
60 percent of MMDAs, the proportion of personal accounts is lower,
about 75 percent.
After being swollen by MMDA inflows in the first quarter, non-
transactions M2 decelerated markedly in the second and third quarters.
Growth in non-transactions M2 since June has been concentrated in the
small time deposit component, reflecting a steepening of the yield
curve as well as the reduction in offering rates on MMDAs from their
promotional levels. With deposit rates already substantially deregu-
lated, there was little noticeable change in deposit flows following
the removal on October 1 of all remaining restrictions on small time
deposits with original maturities or notice periods greater than 31
days. Overnight RPs and Eurodollars grew 29 percent through November,
about the pace of 1982. By September, the share of M2 featuring
market-related yields had risen to over 57 percent, up from 52-1/2
percent in December 1982.
Reflecting MMDA inflows, M2 grew from the fourth quarter of
1982 through November at a 12 percent annual rate; however, from the
February-March period used by the FOMC as the base for its target

III-A-3
growth range, expansion through November was 8 percent. M2 velocity,
after declining at a record rate in the first quarter, rose over the
rest of the year; over the year as a whole, velocity fell by 1 per-
cent. However, adjusting for the estimated impact of non-M2 funds
attracted by MMDAs in the first quarter, M2 velocity rose 4 percent,
a bit more than the average for the first year of earlier recoveries.
Indeed, the growth in adjusted M2 velocity exceeded that of any year
since 1978, the year rate deregulation began, suggesting that boosts
to M2 growth stemming from the progressive removal of rate ceilings
may be over.
Despite an annual rate of decline .in its large time component
exceeding 40 percent, M3 growth during the first quarter picked up
a bit from the last quarter of 1982 before settling down to a more
moderate pace in the second and third quarters. In the July through
October period, the level of M3 was held down by unusually high levels
of Treasury note balances at depositories. However, M3 growth picked
up sharply in November when these accounts were reduced to more nor-
mal levels. Reliance on term RPs through November was quite strong
compared with 1982, perhaps reflecting abundant collateral. However,
the impact of term RP expansion on M3 was about offset by outflows
from institution-only MMMFs. Overall, the non-M2 component of M3
contracted from the fourth quarter of 1982 through November, and M3
growth, at 9-1/2 percent, fell below that of M2 after exceeding it
in the previous four years. (On an MMDA-adjusted basis, M2 growth
was below that of M3--in roughly the average relationship of recent
years). M3 velocity rose on balance over 1983, but by less than the
average of previous recoveries.
The runoff of large time deposits was entirely at commercial
banks, where the cumulative decline from the fourth quarter of 1982
through November was $45 billion, or 16-1/2 percent. By contrast,
thrift institutions continued to issue large time deposits--$32-1/2
billion over this period. The thrifts' reliance on large time deposits
reflected a combination of a rate incentive to pay down FHLBB advances
and mortgage demands that exceeded core deposit inflows, particularly
on the West Coast.
The decline in the non-M2 component of M3 in 1983 reflected in
part a $1 billion increase in net borrowing by commercial banks from
their foreign branches in the first 11 months of the year. These
borrowings, which were preceded by several years of net advances,
included a cumulative repatriation of funds from foreign branches since
April of $15-1/2 billion, following $14-1/2 billion in advances that
occurred in January-March period, when MMDA inflows were strongest.
Banks also increased their reliance on domestic nondeposit sources,
particularly in November as Treasury balances fell sharply, and total
nondeposit funds rose on balance over the first 11 months of the year.

III-A-4
Domestic nonfinancial debt expanded by 10-1/4 percent through
November, only a bit above the pace of last year. Reflecting the
impact of MMDA inflows, as well as the effect on thrift institutions
of a considerable pickup in mortgage demands, the share of this debt
intermediated by depository institutions grew substantially, rising
from just over one-third in 1982 to over fifty percent during the
first three quarters of this year. Similar increases have occurred
following earlier cyclical troughs, with the depositories' share often
rising above recent levels. The pace of federal government debt
issuance remained at about the nearly 20 percent rate of last year.
The pickup in other debt reflected a more than doubling in the growth
rate of consumer and mortgage credit. This strength more than offset
a deceleration in nonfinancial business debt, whose growth slowed from
6 percent in 1982 to 3-3/4 percent through November of this year.

APPENDIX B*
NOVEMBER SURVEYS OF BANK LENDING PRACTICES AND TERMS OF BANK LENDING
Commercial and industrial lending by large commercial banks
remained sluggish in the three months prior to the November 15, 1983
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, as over-
all financing requirements were weak and firms turned more to other
short-term sources of credit. Half of the 60 banks participating
in the survey expected loan demand to strengthen moderately over the
next three months in response to economic expansion nationwide and
in their local areas; only three institutions expected further weak-
ening in loan demand. In the November survey, larger respondents
tended to be somewhat less optimistic than smaller institutions
about a near-term strengthening in loan demand, the reverse of
the situation that had prevailed at the time of the August survey.
Short-term market rates declined somewhat from mid-August to
mid-November, but the prime rate remained at 11 percent. Other
aspects of lending terms also appear to have changed little from
mid-August; 85 percent of the panel reported no change over the
past three months in standards of creditworthiness to qualify for
their lowest lending rate, and about the same proportion reported
no change in standards to qualify for given spreads above their
lowest lending rates. Similarly, 85 percent of the responding
banks reported unchanged policies towards lending to new and non-
local business customers, while 75 percent indicated no change in
compensating balance and fee requirements on business loans.
Continuing the pattern evident since the November 1982 survey,
nearly one third of the respondents to the latest survey indicated
an increased willingness to make installment loans to individuals
compared with three months ago. Several institutions reporting no
change since mid-August in willingness to make consumer installment
loans noted that they were still actively promoting existing consumer
loan products. Interest rate spreads on consumer loans continue to
be favorable, and delinquency rates on consumer installment loans
declined to a ten-year low of 1.91 percent in the third quarter of
1983.
The first set of supplemental questions to the November survey
examined the extent to which business customers of banks had turned
to the commercial paper market as an alternative source of short-term
credit. Two thirds of all respondents, and an even higher proportion
of larger banks, indicated that some of their customers had raised
new funds through the commercial paper market during the three months

Assistant, Banking Section, Division of Research and Statistics.

preceding the survey. Among institutions noting this development,
four fifths cited favorable rate spreads as the primary reason why
their customers chose this method of financing. In addition, some
respondents noted that improving profitability and stronger balance
sheets had boosted the credit ratings of some firms in recent months,
enabling them to borrow at more favorable rates in the commercial
paper market. A few respondents indicated that some customers
issued commercial paper in order to avoid certain restrictive terms
and covenants placed on borrowers by banks or to maintain a presence
in the commercial paper market. Only about one quarter of responding
banks indicated that those customers having access to the commercial
paper market had a greater need for short-term financing over the past
three months than customers without such access.
Just over one fifth of respondents felt that the competitive
position of their bank relative to the commercial paper market had
deteriorated over the prior three months. Nearly three fourths of
those indicating a deterioration cited an increase in their bank's
cost of funds relative to commercial paper rates while only one
respondent cited an increased markup over the bank's cost of funds
in pricing loans.
A second set of supplemental questions examined the various
interest rates to which outstanding short-term commercial and indus-
trial loans are tied. In order to meet competition from the commercial
paper market and other sources of credit--including U.S. offices of
foreign banks--domestically chartered banks now offer several types of
short-term loans. Traditional short-term commercial and industrial
loans, with interest rates tied to prime, now are utilized principally
by middle-sized and smaller commercial and industrial firms. The
largest firms, and a growing number of middle-sized firms, are obtain-
ing loan commitment agreements that contain a "menu" of pricing options
for their loans. Typically, these borrowers may choose a loan rate
tied to prime, the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR), a domestic
money market rate (such as a bank CD rate), or a "blend" of market
rates.1 Moreover, the agreement usually permits the borrower consid-
erable flexibility in switching from one pricing optionto another over
the term of a loan.2 The biggest corporations also have access to
very large short-term loans, with maturities ranging from overnight
to perhaps two weeks, that are priced at a markup over a domestic
money market rate such as the federal funds rate.
1. The mix of pricing options often is custom-tailored to the bor-
rower's wishes.
2. Usually, a loan may be switched from prime-rate pricing on very
short notice, in many cases within 24 hours or so. A customer elect-
ing to have the loan priced off LIBOR or a domestic market rate often
can switch out of these options only at certain intervals--such as 90
days--specified in the commitment agreement.

III-B-3
Responses to these supplemental questions indicated that the
proportion of outstanding short-term loans tied to any given interest
rate varies widely across banks. For example, the percent of outstand-
ing short-term loans linked to the prime rate ranged from 10 to 95
percent, the largest banks tending to lie at the lower end of the range.
Several respondents commented that the proportion of their institutions'
outstanding short-term loans tied to prime continues to decline over
time. When weighted by the size of the commercial and industrial loan
portfolios at each responding bank, the responses suggest that roughly
half of respondents' outstanding short-term C&I loans are tied to
prime.1 Similar calculations revealed that roughly 18 percent of
respondents' short-term C&I loans were tied to LIBOR, about 10 percent
were tied to a domestic CD rate, and about 20 percent were tied to
other rates, including "blends" of interest rates which in some cases
represent a bank's internal cost of funds. About 4 percent of out-
standing short-term C&I loans were tied to the federal funds rate.
Preliminary data from the recent Survey of Terms of Bank Lending
(STBL) are consistent with these results. This survey, taken during
early November, indicates that 89 percent of that week's gross short-
term commercial and industrial loan extensions by 48 large banks were
made at interest rates below prime, up from the 72 percent level
reported in the August survey. At the smaller banks surveyed, the
percent of gross short-term loans extended at rates below prime rose
to 45 percent. Loans priced at markups over a short-term market rate
may carry rates above or below prime, depending upon whether or not
the size of the markup exceeds the spread of the prime rate over the
market rate. When the spread between the prime rate and market rates
widens, as it did between the August and November surveys, the propor-
tion of short-term loan extensions counted as below-prime lending
increases. After adjustment for this effect, however, STBL data show
a secular upward trend in the proportion of below-prime lending--
confirming comments from loan officers that prime-rate pricing
continues to decline.
The proportion of short-term loan extensions made below prime,
as reported in the STBL, is well above the proportion of outstanding
short-term loans priced off money market rates, as estimated from
responses received from the supplemental loan officer questions on
loan pricing. However, shorter term loans turn over more frequently
and thus loom much larger in the STBL data than in banks' portfolios
of outstanding short-term C&I loans. Because the bulk of very short
maturity loans are made at rates below prime, the percent of gross
loan extensions at rates below prime substantially exceeds the percent
of outstanding short-term loans priced below prime.
1. When respondents indicated that the reported proportions applied to
the total amount of domestic C&I loans plus loans to U.S. residents
booked at foreign branches, the weights were adjusted accordingly.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The increase of nearly three percent in the weighted-average
exchange value of the dollar since mid-November (see chart) seems
surprisingly high in light of developments over the period. For example,
while dollar interest rates have increased about a quarter of a
percentage point at both short and long maturities, foreign interest
rates have also tended to rise. Thus, the differential between interest
rates on U.S. three-month CDs and a weighted-average of foreign
three-month interest rates has increased by only about one-eighth of a
percentage point.
Increasing tensions in Lebanon have apparently led to additional
demand for dollar assets by heightening concerns about security of
financial assets located in some parts of the world. The bombing of the
U.S. embassy in Kuwait also appeared, at least initially, to be a factor
putting upward pressure on the dollar's value. And recent financial and
political instability in Germany might have contributed to the dollar's
rise, not only in terms of marks, but also vis-a-vis the other EMS
currencies, which have moved largely in parallel with the mark over the
period. The likely importance of these "safe-haven" factors in
explaining the behavior of market participants seems greater when one
observes that the price of gold has risen nearly two percent in dollar
terms since November 14, and has therefore increased about 4-1/2 percent
on average in terms of major foreign currencies.
Certain other developments since mid-November probably exerted some
downward pressure on the dollar's value. These factors include new data

confirming the large and growing U.S. trade and current-account deficits
(discussed elsewhere in the Greenbook) and the notable shift in foreign
official dollar intervention
.(The Federal
Reserve and the U.S. Treasury together purchased $50 million equivalent
of marks during the period.)
The mark and its EMS partner currencies declined in value about
3-1/2 percent in dollar terms over the review period, and sterling
declined nearly 5 percent vis-a-vis the dollar. The depreciation in
sterling seemed to be associated with weakness in oil prices and the OPEC
ministers meeting in early December. By contrast, the yen's value
declined less than one percent in dollar terms. Differential movement in
the yen's value, which has been evident during most of 1983, is perhaps
most directly attributable to the sizable surplus in the Japanese current
account.

IV-4
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Data on U.S. international financial transactions during October
show a partial reversal of the large third-quarter net inflow through
U.S. banking offices. (See the Summary Table on the next page.) Private
foreigners purchased, net, $2.3 billion of U.S. Treasury securities
during October, a relatively large sum, but added little to their
holdings of U.S. corporate bonds and stocks. U.S. net purchases of
foreign securities declined slightly from their average rate in recent
months.
Foreign official reserve holdings in the United States increased by
$1.7 billion in October; partial data, based on holdings at the New York
Federal Reserve Bank, indicate little change in aggregate holdings during
November. Reserve holdings of G-10 countries increased by $1.5 billion
in October and, at the NYFRB, declined by about $1 billion during
November.OPEC holdings declined by about $3/4 billion in each month,
while dollar holdings in the United States increased in each month for
several Pacific Basin countries, including Australia, which allowed its
currency to float in early December in the face of sustained capital
inflows.
Data for November on international banking transactions that are
reported to the Federal Reserve (see the International Banking Data
Table) show a $5.5 billion net inflow to U.S. banking offices from their
own foreign offices (line 1) plus a net inflow of $3.3 billion from all
foreign sources channeled through IBFs (line 2). For October and
November combined the net inflow through these channel, amounted to $4.5
billion. These inflows were associated with the strong expansion of
credit demands in the United States relative to foreign countries, which

has been accompanied by an expansion in U.S. banking offices' holdings
of U.S. Treasury securities and loans to private nonbanks, and which in
turn has required these banks to increase their liabilities to domestic
residents or to draw down their net claims on foreigners. Agencies and
branches of Japanese banks have been particularly active since mid-year
in expanding their loans to U.S. residents with funds from their own
offices abroad. In addition, foreign branches of U.S. banks extended
$1.8 billion of credit directly to U.S. nonbank residents during October
and November combined (line 4), as the decline in LIBOR rates relative to
prime rates since last summer apparently induced firms to shift to LIBOR
borrowing, which was booked at offshore offices.
The expansion of the Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbanks slowed to
$1 billion in the third quarter from $7.5 billion in the first half of
this year and $17 billion during 1982. The slowdown has accompanied a
decline in the differential between Eurodollar CD rates and domestic CD
rates, which in turn has reflected the phase-in of reserve requirements
on Eurocurrency liabilities (currently 2.625 percent for member banks)
and the decline since mid-1982 in the general level of dollar interest
rates.
Data covering foreign lending by U.S.-chartered banks (including
their foreign branches) in the third quarter show a drop of $1/2 billion
in claims on non-OPEC developing countries. Total claims decreased more
than $14 billion. The small drop in claims on non-OPEC developing
countries brought the outstanding amount in September back to the March
level. Claims on Brazil rose $100 million, including additions from
interest arrears. Claims on Mexico rose $500 million, reflecting inter
alia the U.S. banks' share of about $700 million in further Mexican

IV-8
drawings on the $5 billion loan signed in March. Among other developing
countries, claims on Chile increased $300 million, claims on Israel fell
$600 million, and claims on Peru, Korea, and the Philippines each fell by
almost $300 million. The decline vis-a-vis the Philippines is consistent
with reports that banks generally were reducing their exposure to that
country in the third quarter. A decrease of $11 billion in claims on
other G-10 countries and Switzerland was widespread and largely involved
interbank placements.

IV-9
U.S. Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in October reached a new record
level as imports rose sharply and exports were about unchanged.
The rise in imports, to a level nearly 10 percent above the third-
quarter average, was widespread across commodity categories and in part
reflected the recent pick-up in U.S. economic activity. Particularly
large increases were recorded in consumer goods and machinery; increases
in imports of automotive products (from both Canada and Japan) and of
industrial supplies were almost as large. The average price of nonoil
imports, which had declined steadily from the second quarter of 1982

through the second quarter of 1983, increased fractionally in the
third quarter (by about one-half percent at an annual rate) and in
October was close to the third-quarter level. The appreciating value of
the dollar during the past year importantly affected these import price
developments.
The value of oil imports in October was about the same as in
September and in the third quarter on average -- an increase in price was
offset by a small decline in volume. Oil import prices increased by
about 25 cents per barrel in October, reflecting in part price increases
in the spot market that occurred during the summer and higher contract
prices announced in August by several producers, particularly Mexico and
Venezuela. However, oil consumption in the United States and in other
countries has declined in recent months and as a result, spot market
prices which rose through mid-August have eased since then. Recent OPEC
production rates reflect these downward price pressures; it is estimated
that OPEC production averaged 17.8-18.0 million barrels per day (mbd) in
November, down from 19.0 mbd in September and 18.5-19.0 mbd in October.
OPEC oil ministers announced at their December 7-9 meeting their
intention to maintain their official benchmark price at $29 per barrel
and their quarterly production ceiling at 17.5 mbd.

Exports in October were at about the third-quarter rate.
Agricultural exports declined from September levels, largely because
soybean exports dropped back from temporarily strong rates. Prices of
agricultural exports rose sharply during the third quarter and again in
October; between July and October there was an 8 percent rise, with much
of the impetus coming from soybeans (which account for about one-third of
U.S. agricultural exports). The soybean crop was lower than expected
this fall; it ended up one-third lower than normal. In addition, U.S.
stocks before the harvest were extremely low. The combination of low
stocks and poor harvests caused the price to move up sharply. In
response to these factors, various U.S. customers bought soybeans earlier
than usual (especially Japan) causing a bunching of shipments in the
third quarter.
Nonagricultural exports in October were marginally above the
third-quarter rate. In October and in recent months, the increases have
come largely in machinery (particularly business machines); increases
have also been recorded in industrial supplies since the summer. Despite
the recent increases in nonagricultural exports, in October the volume
was only 3 percent above levels recorded in the fourth quarter of 1982
and was still 14 percent less than the volume exported in the fourth
quarter of 1981; Mexico accounted for about one-quarter of the decline
since the fourth quarter of 1981 and about one-half of the increase since
the fourth quarter of 1982. The economic recovery in major trading-
partner countries continues to be sluggish and the persistent high level
of the exchange value of the dollar continues to adversely affect the
price competitiveness of U.S. goods.

IV-12
Foreign Economic Developments. The general upturn in economic
activity in the major foreign industrial countries which became evident
early this year has, on balance, continued in recent months. However,
the pace of this recovery has remained weak in most countries. Only in
Canada, where real income increased at an annual rate of more than 7
percent in the first three quarters, could growth be described as robust.
A resumption of real income growth in Italy in the third quarter appears
to have signaled the end of a three-year recession. In Japan, there are
indications that the pace of the recovery may be increasing. In both
Germany and the United Kingdom recovery in 1983 has been weak, with no
signs in recent months of accelerating growth. Economic activity in
France has also been relatively flat recently and may well weaken further
in coming months as the government's austerity measures are increasingly
felt. Unemployment rates in the major foreign industrial economies have
remained stable or declined slightly in recent months, but -- with the
exception of Canada -- remain above levels of one year ago.
Inflation rates abroad have, in general, remained moderate in
recent months relative to their levels of 1982. However, recent data
have not indicated any further reduction in overall inflationary
pressures. In Italy the rate of inflation has moved higher in the last
several months, while a movement in the opposite direction has taken
place in Germany. French inflation has failed to stay below double-digit
rates despite government forecasts of moderating price pressures.
Trade and current account balances in France have continued to
swing sharply from deficit toward surplus in recent months, in part
because weak domestic demand has helped to hold down imports. In

contrast, the Canadian current account moved into deficit in the third
quarter as rapid domestic growth stimulated continued sharp rises in
imports. The Japanese current account surplus contracted somewhat in
October, but a record high yearly surplus of over $20 billion for 1983
appears likely.
Recent economic news from Japan indicates that the prospects for a
more rapid recovery have brightened somewhat in the aftermath of the
October policy package. (After some delays, the tax cuts in the new
policy package were approved by the Diet.) October's industrial
production index fell by 0.7 percent (s.a.) from September's high level,
but the average level for the most recent three months was more than 4
percent above that for the previous three months. Labor market
conditions in October also eased somewhat as shown by the decline from
the record unemployment level seen in September. Recent monthly
assessments by both the Bank of Japan and the Japanese Economic Planning
Agency have noted signs of an increased pace of consumption -- including
stronger sales of durables -- as well as ongoing strength in exports.
The long decline in housing appears to have tapered off, and some large
corporations have revised their investment plans upward.
Both wholesale and consumer prices continue to give no indication
of significant upward pressure. The wholesale price index in November
was essentially unchanged from the October level; the November consumer
price index was slightly below its October level and about only 2 percent
above its level of a year ago.
Although the current-account surplus contracted in October by $400

IV-17
million (s.a.) to $1.6 billion, the current account still is headed for a
record annual total of more than $20 billion for all of 1983. The
decline in the surplus in October was due primarily to an increase in
imports by more than $500 million. Net long-term capital outflows were
$2.4 billion, about the same as in September, bringing the cumulative
long-term capital account deficit to almost $15 billion for the first ten
months.
General elections for the Lower House of the Japanese Diet have
been set for December 18.
Real economic activity in Germany has remained relatively weak in
recent months. Industrial production decreased by 0.2 percent (s.a.) in
October, but remained 4 percent above its recessionary trough level
reached late last year. The unemployment rate in both October and
November was 9.3 percent (s.a.), down slightly from the level of previous
months.
The inflation rate, which had moved higher during the summer, has
moderated in recent months. Consumer prices in November increased by
only 0.2 percent (n.s.a.) after remaining unchanged in October, bringing
the year-over-year consumer price inflation rate down to 2.6 percent.
Wholesale prices declined by 0.1 percent (n.s.a.) in October and were
virtually unchanged from their year-earlier level.
The current account swung into surplus by $1.1 billion (n.s.a.) in
October following three consecutive months of deficits. For the first
ten months of this year, the current account was in surplus by $1 billion
compared with a deficit of $700 million in the corresponding period last

IV-18
year. The trade surplus in October increased to $1.6 billion (n.s.a.).
The cumulative trade surplus in the first ten months of 1983 totaled
$13.8 billion, slightly less than the $16.5 billion surplus recorded in
this period during 1982.
The growth of central bank money (CBM) has continued to slow.
October's 0.2 percent (s.a.) increase was the smallest monthly rise of
the year and lowered the rate of monetary growth from the fourth quarter
of last year to 7.5 percent (s.a.a.r.), only slightly above the upper end
of the Bundesbank's 4 to 7 percent target range for CBM growth between
the fourth quarters of 1982 and 1983.
In France, economic activity has shown little trend in recent
months, as the stimulative effect of increased exports has tended to
offset the contractionary impact of the government's restrictive
macroeconomic policies. Industrial production decreased by 1.5 percent
(s.a.) in September, but remained 2.4 percent above its year-earlier
level. Unemployment in October continued at the 8.8 percent (s,a.) level
for the sixth consecutive month.
The inflation rate has given little indication of moderating in
recent months. In November, consumer prices increased by 0.5 percent
(n.s.a.), bringing the year-over-year consumer price inflation rate to
10 percent. Wholesale prices increased by 13.6 percent in the twelve
months to October. Annual wage negotiations in the private sector are
about to begin. The government has stated that wage agreements reached
must be consistent with its official inflation target of limiting the
increase in consumer prices to 5 percent in 1984.

IV-19
The trade and current account balances have swung sharply from
deficit toward surplus in recent months. In the third quarter, the
current account was in surplus by $300 million (s.a.), the first
quarterly surplus in two years. For the first nine months of 1983, the
current account was in deficit at a rate of $6 billion (s.a.a.r.), half
the deficit rate of the previous year. The trade deficit rate was also
cut nearly in half over the same period. The main goal of the
government's austerity program -- elimination of the trade deficit by the
end of 1984 -appears increasingly likely to be achieved.
In the United Kingdom recent data appear to indicate a continued
recovery, although some signs of possible weakness remain. In September
the industrial production index rose almost enough to offset its decline
in August, but then fell slightly again in October. The average of the
index for the three months ending October was 1.5 percent above its level
in the same period in 1982. After a sharp rise in September the volume
of retail sales (s.a.) fell in October, but most of this decline was
reversed in November. The November unemployment rate of 12.3 percent
(s.a.) was unchanged from that of October. The rate of inflation
remained essentially unchanged in October, with the retail price index 5
percent above its level one. year earlier.
In October, the trade balance and the current account balance
returned to deficit, following surpluses in both figures in September.
The cumulative trade account now shows a deficit of $2.6 billion,
compared with a surplus of $3.6 billion for all of 1982.
The rate of growth of the three targeted monetary aggregates has

IV-20
slowed somewhat in recent months. Through November, EM3 has grown at
an annual rate of 10.5 percent from the target base of February. This
rate is just within the target range of 7-11 percent set last March for
all three aggregates. Ml and PSL2 remained slightly above target in
November. In recent weeks U.K. authorities have announced their
intention of using the monetary base, M-zero (MO), as an additional
variable conveying information about monetary conditions. Notes and coin
outstanding in the hands of the public and the banks comprise over 95
percent of MO. Banks' discretionary operational deposits -- but not
their compulsory deposits -- at the Bank of England are the other
component of MO. In his autumn budget statement Chancellor of the
Exchequor Nigel Lawson reaffirmed his intention to restrain the public
sector borrowing requirement next fiscal year to b8 billion
(approximately 2.5 percent of GDP) as set out in the Medium-Term
Financial Strategy. The Chancellor stated that achieving this target may
require some small increases in taxes in 1984.
In Italy the recession that commenced in 1980 appears to have
ended. In the third quarter, real GDP rose by 3.7 percent (s.a.a.r.)
and, although data on the components of domestic demand are not yet
available, indications are that private consumption spending and stock
building account for much of the growth. Exports rose slightly while
imports increased sharply. The recovery was also reflected in industrial
production data, with industrial production in the third quarter rising
at an annual rate of over 6 percent (s.a.). In the three months ending
in November, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 14 percent

IV-21
compared with a 9 percent rate of increase during the summer months.
However, inflation remains below that seen in 1982. The year-over-year
consumer price increase in November of 12.7 percent was 4 percentage
points less than the increase during the year ending in November 1982.
The trade deficit during the first ten months of this year was less than
$8 billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with a $16 billion deficit rate in the
corresponding period of 1982.
On November 24 the Senate passed and sent to the Chamber of
Deputies a slightly modified version of the Craxi government's 1984
budget package. Even if this legislation is approved by the lower house,
recent estimates show that further substantial budget savings will be
needed to achieve the govenment's target of no increase in the enlarged
public sector deficit in nominal terms. This year the deficit is likely
to exceed 16 percent of GDP.
The Canadian economy continued its robust expansion in the third
quarter posting an 8.3 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth
of real GNP. This follows real growth of approximately 7 percent over
the first half of this year. Inventory accumulation was partly
responsible for the high rate of growth recorded in the third quarter.
In contrast, the value of inventories declined in each of the seven
previous quarters. Real private consumption increased in the third
quarter while investment declined slightly in the aggregate, largely as a
result of declines in residential and non-residential construction.
However, real investment in machinery and equipment increased for the
second consecutive quarter after falling sharply over the previous year

IV-22
and a half. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 11.1 percent in
November after falling for ten consecutive months.
Inflation remains well below the double digit rates of the
previous three years. Consumer prices rose 4.9 percent in the twelve
months ending in October while producer prices grew at an even slower 2.8
percent rate.
The seasonally adjusted current account deficit of $150 million in
the third quarter was the first quarterly deficit recorded in over a
year. The cumulative current account for the year to date remains in
surplus by $1 billion. The trade surplus has been reduced over the
course of the year despite strong growth of exports, particularly to the
United States, as the growth in imports has been even more rapid.
The Debt Problem Situation in Important Developing Countries
Concern about Brazil's debt situation has eased somewhat over the
last month, as Brazil and the IMF reached agreement on a revised program
and progress was made on official and private bank financing arrangements
for 1984. While Mexico and Chile continue to perform well under their
IMF programs, both are concerned about depressed internal economic condi-
tions. Peru, Argentina and the Philippines are out of compliance with
their 1983 IMF programs and have not yet reached agreement with the IMF
on stabilization programs for 1984. Venezuela's new government appears to
be as reluctant as its predecessor to negotiate with the IMF.
On November 22, Brazil received approval from the IMF Executive
Board of its request for a waiver and modification of the performance
criteria under its three-year Extended Fund Facility program. Brazil was
then able to draw from the Fund $1.2 billion, consisting of the scheduled

IV-23
November drawing and two earlier quarterly drawings that had been delayed
because of Brazil's non-compliance with its original Fund program.
Brazil also drew $68 million in November from the IMF Buffer Stock
Facility to finance the holdings of sugar stocks in connection with the
International Sugar Agreement. Brazil repaid the remaining $1.05 billion
outstanding on its BIS bridge loan out of these drawings. Brazil's IMF
drawing triggered the release of $1.8 billion of old Project I funds from
banks. These funds were used to repay the principal of a bank bridge
loan made in late 1982 and to pay part of the accumulated interest
arrears. Total Brazilian arrears have reportedly dropped below $2
billion. With regard to the external financing plan designed to fill an
estimated $11 billion 1983-84 financing gap, banks have committed about
$6.2 billion to the $6.5 billion Phase II "new money" facility. The
efforts to raise $2.5 billion in new foreign official assistance in the
form of export guarantees are well advanced. (The U.S. portion has
already been committed, in the form of a special program of up to $1.5
billion in Eximbank guarantees, subject to commitments from other
governments). Brazil's August 1983 to December 1984 payments to official
creditors of about $3.8 billion were rescheduled at a Paris Club meeting.
Brazil recorded a trade surplus of $566 million in November,
bringing the surplus for January-November to $6.05 billion, surpassing
the IMF projection of $6 billion for the entire year. (The trade surplus
in all of 1982 was less than $1 billion.) Prices rose 8.4 percent in
November; over the 11 months through November, prices rose at an annual
rate of 218 percent. Under its IMF program Brazil has promised to reduce
its inflation rate to 75-100 percent in 1984. While this is only a

IV-24
target, failure to reduce the rate of inflation would jeopardize Brazil's
achievement of program performance criteria, especially the public sector
borrowing requirement.
Mexico recorded a current account surplus of $3.5 billion in the
first nine months of 1983 and seems likely to end the year with a surplus
of at least $4 billion. A reserve gain of about $3 billion is in pros-
pect. These results, made possible by a 45 percent contraction in
imports, are being achieved at the cost of a 4 percent decline in real
GDP. In 1984, Mexican strategy calls for real GDP to rise by 1 percent.
In consequence, the current account surplus is expected to shrink to no
more than $2.5 billion. Faced with debt amortization payments of $4.5
billion (after the 1983 debt restructuring) and a desire to continue to
rebuild reserves, Mexico has begun discussions with foreign commercial
banks regarding a new credit for 1984. Mexico is asking for easier terms
than those of the $5 billion credit signed last March. After declining
fairly steadily for most of the year, the monthly rate of increase in the
CPI jumped to 5.9 percent in November, in response to substantial
increases in public sector prices. This was more than two percentage
points higher than the average of the previous three months.
The debt restructuring negotiations for Argentina's 1983 maturi-
ties, totalling in excess of $5.5 billion, were halted in late September
when controversy arose regarding the terms of a model debt restructuring
agreement for Argentine Airlines. The new Argentine leaders, who took
office December 10, have indicated that they intend to seek easier terms.
Argentina did not make the August and November drawings (of $315 million
each) under the IMF stand-by arrangement because it failed to settle at

IV-25
least a portion of its arrears and because it would have needed IMF
waivers on the temporary use of a subsidy on automobile exports--a
multiple currency practice-and on the use of exchange controls since
September 30. The IMF was reluctant to grant the waivers in view of the
growing likelihood of non-compliance with the agreement's quantitative
performance criteria related to public sector expenditures and monetary
expansion. The new Argentine leaders are exploring the possibility of
reinstating the current stand-by, which runs until April 1984, and are
interested in developing a follow-on program. The initial $500 million
disbursement on the $1.5 billion medium-term bank loan signed in August
was finally made on December 1 after several postponements. The dis-
bursement was used, along with $30 million of reserves, to make an over-
due $350 million payment on the bridge loan of a year ago and to elimi-
nate interest arrears for September and early October. The country's new
leaders are facing a depressed economy on the threshhold of hyperinfla-
tion. (In November, the CPI rose by 19.2 percent and stood more than 400
percent above the year-earlier level.) International reserves are
virtually exhausted, arrears on current payments are likely to exceed $2
billion by January 1, a current account deficit of about $2 billion is in
prospect for 1984, and an estimated $5 billion of public sector debts
falls due in the next twelve months. As one of its first actions, the
new government imposed extensive price controls.
Peru's central bank now estimates that 1983 real GDP will show a
decline of at least 12 percent, as the effects of this year's natural
disasters spread. As the economic slide steepens, it becomes more
difficult to bring the IMP-approved stabilization program back on track.

IV-26
The fiscal deficit, originally targetted to be 4.1 percent of GDP, is now
likely to exceed 9 percent of GDP. The results of municipal elections
held in November are being interpreted as a vote against further austerity
measures. Nevertheless, the government continues to work with the IMF in
the hope of reaching an agreement on a new program by early January.
Chile continues to meet the targets of its IMF-approved stabiliza-
tion program and drew $57 million under its stand-by arrangement in mid-
November. Banks expect to make the final $230 million disbursement of
Chile's $1.3 billion new credit at the end of December as scheduled, but
the disbursement could be delayed if efforts to reach final agreement on
the rescheduling of $3.4 billion of debt due in 1983-84 are not success-
ful. Chilean authorites are concerned about persistently high unemploy-
ment (18 percent in recent months) and the fact that 1983 real GDP growth
will probably be zero. They are proposing to apply more fiscal stimulus
in 1984, which would induce faster growth, a larger current account
deficit and, hence, larger financing needs. It is not clear that the IMF
would approve such a policy course; the IMF is skeptical of Chile's
ability to obtain the $900 million or so in new credits that would be
required.
Venezuela has been granted a fourth moratorium, this one through
January 31, 1984, on public sector principal payments to banks. The
banks granted the extension after the Venezuelan President issued a decree
allowing interest payments on private, non-commercial foreign debt at the
preferential exchange rate of 4.3 bolivars per dollar until December 31,
1983. Despite this decree, arrears on private sector interest payments
continue to grow and are currently estimated to be $700 million, as the

IV-27
central bank refuses to authorize the release of foreign exchange for this
purpose. Presidential elections were held in Venezuela on December 4.
The new administration, which takes office on February 2, 1984, has shown
the same resistance to an IMF program as the previous administration.
Banks continue to demand an IMF program as a precondition to the resched-
uling of Venezuela's bank debts, although some banks are reportedly
wavering.
In mid-November the Philippines signed an IMF Letter of Intent for
a new 18-month $650 million stand-by arrangement. However, the Managing
Director has not yet accepted the proposal and has now sent another IMF
mission to Manila to check on reports of a Jump in money growth, a $400
million increase in the Philippine central bank estimate of arrears, and
a $200 million underestimate of interest obligations through 1984. In
light of these developments, the 12-member Commercial Bank Advisory
Committee for the Philippines, which had reached a tentative agreement to
recommend the the extension of $1.65 billion in new bank credits to the
Philippines through the end of next year, decided to adjourn until early
in January. The proposed bank package also included the refinancing of
about $2 billion in principal payments falling due between mid-October
1983 and June 1985 and the maintenance of about $3.5 billion in revolving
trade credits to the Philippines. Besides the new commercial bank
credits the Philippines was also seeking an additional $1.65 billion from
foreign governments and the multilateral development banks. A Paris Club
meeting to reschedule official bilateral debt has been tentatively set
for January 1984.
