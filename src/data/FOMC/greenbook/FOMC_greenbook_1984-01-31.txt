The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
As the recovery entered its second year, the pace of economic
expansion appeared to be settling down to the more moderate rate that is
characteristic of this phase of an expansion. Increases in employment
and industrial production in December were smaller than the rapid gains
seen earlier in 1983. Consumption and business spending continued to
show strength, but housing activity was flat and the trade deficit widened
further. Overall, inflation remained moderate, although food prices
have begun to pick up.
Gross National Product
Real GNP increased at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, according to the Commerce Department's preliminary estimate,
down from the 7.6 percent growth rate of the third quarter. For the four
quarters of 1983 the increase in GNP was 6.1 percent, slightly short of
the average gain for the first year of a recovery. Private domestic
demand remained strong in the fourth quarter, with personal consumption
expenditures growing at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate and business fixed
investment rising at a 22 percent pace. However, more than one-third
of the increase in private domestic final purchases (that is, consumption,
housing, and business fixed investment) was met by additional imports.
Industrial Production
In December, industrial production increased an estimated 0.5
percent following gains of 0.8 and 0.7 percent in October and November,
respectively. Production of durable consumer goods rose almost 2 percent
in December as auto assemblies increased to an annual rate of 8.0 million

units, the highest level of car production since July 1979. For January,
assemblies currently are scheduled at a rate of 8.4 million units.
Output of business equipment continued to rise rapidly in December
with a sizable gain occurring in oil and gas well drilling, which has
rebounded from a very depressed level. Output of construction supplies
remained unchanged toward year-end and was up less than 1 percent from
its September level.
Materials output rose only 0.3 percent in December, partly reflec-
ting the stiff foreign competition faced by domestic producers of basic
metals, especially steel. Most of the December gain was attributable to
a surge in electricity generation associated with the severe weather in
the latter half of the month.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities advanced
0.3 percentage point in December to 79.4 percent, the highest rate since
September 1981. The operating rate for manufacturing increased only
slightly in December; within manufacturing, however, operating rates for
auto assemblies and for the electrical machinery and paper industries
advanced strongly.
Employment and Unemployment
The employment situation continued to improve in December, but not
quite as rapidly as in earlier months. Payroll employment advanced
230,000 in December compared with average monthly increases of 325,000
in the preceding eight months. In manufacturing, employment rose 90,000
in December, led by the strong recovery in the electrical and transportation
equipment industries. At the same time the factory workweek continued to
edge down from its very high level in September. The growth rate of

employment in manufacturing and in nonfarm business payrolls as a
whole has been close to the average for the first year of post-war
recoveries. Although the overall level of payroll employment now has
surpassed its pre-recession high, in the manufacturing sector only
half of the jobs lost in the last recession have been recovered.
The civilian unemployment rate fell another 0.2 percentage point in
December to 8.2 percent. The rapid decline in the unemployment rate has
occurred in part because total household employment growth, which has
exceeded the rise in payroll jobs, has been faster than in most recent
recoveries. At the same time, the labor force participation rate has
been flat over the past year; most of the newly employed apparently have
come from workers who had previously lost their jobs rather than from
those outside the labor force.
Personal Income and Consumption
Personal income rose 0.9 percent in December and, for the fourth
quarter as a whole, increased more rapidly than during the third quarter.
Wage and salary disbursements increased at a $10 billion annual rate in
December-about in line with the average gain during the preceding five
months. But, owing to the PIK program and "reachback" aid to recipients of
Federal Supplemental unemployment compensation, farm income and transfer
payments contributed more to income growth than in previous quarters.
Nominal consumer spending accelerated between the third and fourth quarters,
but with the surge in income the saving rate edged up further to 5.1 percent.
Real personal consumption expenditures grew 6-1/2 percent at an
annual rate in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.2 percent in the

preceding period. The gain reflected higher outlays for durables
(especially autos) and services (particularly for home heating in December).
Automobile sales were at a 10.3 million unit annual rate in
December, the highest selling pace since early 1981. Sales of domestic
autos picked up at year-end, and purchases of imported cars, particularly
European models, remained at a high rate. For the last 20 days of Decem-
ber, sales of domestic autos averaged 7.9 million units at an annual
rate. This selling pace was sustained through the first 20 days of
January.
Holiday-season buying of general merchandise, apparel, and
furniture at retailers was strong, although December's 0.8 percent gain
was not as spectacular as might have been expected from earlier quali-
tative reports. For the fourth quarter as a whole, sales in this cate-
gory climbed 3.3 percent, compared with a 1.1 percent increase in the
third quarter. However, weak food sales and a decline in nominal out-
lays at gasoline stations held the overall quarterly gain in retail
sales excluding autos to 1.4 percent.
Consumer confidence reached very high levels in December according
to both the Michigan Survey Research Center and the Conference Board.
The Michigan measure of sentiment was about the same as the preceding
peak in 1972. The Conference Board index of confidence was the highest
in five years after an advance of more than 4 percent.
Business Fixed Investment
Capital spending continued to climb rapidly in the fourth quarter.
Business investment has been much stronger than average during this
recovery, and survey evidence points to continued growth this year.

Real expenditures on equipment rose 28 percent at an annual rate
last quarter, one of the largest increases of the postwar period. The
fourth quarter gain was particularly strong in heavy industrial machinery,
communications equipment, and trucks. During 1983 as a whole the
investment recovery was broadly based, with such diverse items as office,
computer and communication equipment, heavy industrial machinery, and
autos and trucks all scoring impressive gains. Recent data on new orders
for nondefense capital goods point to continued strength this year.
After rising 1.8 percent in December, the level of new orders stood
about 8 percent above that of the third quarter.
In the structures category, real spending grew 10.1 percent (annual
rate) last quarter, about the same rate as in the third quarter. Public
utilities construction expanded sharply, but industrial building continued
to fall. Although vacancy rates reached a record high of 12.8 percent
in October, office building activity has remained at a relatively high
level.
The annual Commerce Department survey of plant and equipment
spending, taken late in 1983, reported that business plans to increase
nominal capital outlays 9.9 percent in 1984, following a 4.2 percent
decline in 1983. This finding is comparable with those of private surveys;
however, such surveys tend to underpredict investment during a recovery,
partly because of technical differences between measures of investment
spending and plant and equipment spending and partly because capital
spending tend to be revised up as the recovery proceeds.

Business Inventories
Business inventory rebuilding continued in the fourth quarter, but
at a moderate pace. In November, manufacturing and trade inventories
rose at an annual rate of $10 billion in real terms, about the same pace
as in the third quarter. However, the rise in stocks was not sufficient
to match the 2 percent increase in shipments and sales, and the ratio
of inventories to sales for all manufacturing and trade fell further
to 1.54. The ratio has remained around this low level since June.
In November, manufacturers' real inventories remained at their extremely
lean October level. Since the recovery began, manufacturers have rebuilt
almost none of the $13 billion of stocks (1972 dollars, not annualized)
that were liquidated during the contraction phase of this inventory
cycle.
In contrast, much greater stock rebuilding has taken place at trade
establishments. Stocks held by merchant wholesalers at the end of
November were almost back to the previous peak recorded in October 1982.
In the retail sector, inventories expanded briskly by $8.8 billion in
November, putting stocks nearly $2 billion above their pre-liquidation
peak. While close to half of the retailers' stock buildup in November
was in autos, accumulation also took place at nonauto outlets, especially
food, furniture, appliances, and general merchandise stores.
Housing Markets
Housing market activity has settled back to a level somewhat
below its mid-year peak. Housing starts in December declined to 1.67
million units at an annual rate, remaining in the range that has pre-

vailed since September. New home sales were flat in October and Novem-
ber at a level 4 percent lower than the May peak. Existing home sales
rebounded in December; in the fourth quarter, they averaged 2.68 million
at an annual rate, 6 percent less than the high in the second quarter.
Home prices recently have been posting only modest year-over-year increases.
Housing starts in the fourth quarter were at an annual rate of
1.69 million units, down from the 1.79 million unit pace registered in
the third quarter. The fourth quarter decline in starts was broadly
based in terms of both region and type of structure. Single-family
residences were started at an annual rate of 1.02 million units, and
multifamily starts were at .67 million annually. Nevertheless, for the
multifamily sector, the last two quarters of starts had the highest
rates since early 1974. The recent growth in real-estate syndicates,
spurred largely by the 1981 tax law changes, appears to be bidding up
property prices and increasing the profitability of rental construction.
Government Spending -Federal, State, and Local
The federal deficit (unified basis) declined $2.6 bi..ion in
November from its year-earlier level, as the growth of federal spending
slowed. In part, the slowdown reflects the deferral to January of increases
in federal pay levels and in social security benefits. In addition,
unemployment benefits and cash farm price support payments remained below
year-earlier levels. For the 1984 fiscal year through November, outlays were
only 3.8 percent above year-earlier levels. However, for fiscal year
1984 as a whole, the Congressional Budget Office and the Administration
recently have projected an increase in total outlays of about 7 percent.

II-15
Receipts have grown 11 prcent from year-earlier levels during the
first two months of this fiscal year, in line with the rate of increase
for the entire fiscal year recently projected by CBO and the Administration.
Most of the gain in receipts has come from the corporate income tax and
social insurance taxes. Withheld personal income taxes are roughly un-
changed, as recent tax cuts have about offset the effect on receipts of
the strong recovery of personal income.
On a NIPA basis, real total federal purchases fell 7 percent at an
annual rate in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of transfers
that took place under the Payment-in-Kind agriculture program, which are
recorded as a negative purchase by the Commodity Corporation (CCC).
Real nondefense purchases excluding those by CCC increased slightly,
while defense spending rose at a 7 percent rate.
Growth of state and local sector activity slowed in recent months
following its rapid third quarter advance. Real outlays for goods and
services were unchanged in the fourth quarter, following a 4-1/4 percent
rise in the previous three-month period. The recent slowing reflected a
drop in construction spending that reversed about one-third of the sharp
advance in the third quarter.
Exports and Imports
Imports have continued to grow faster than exports in recent months,
reflecting the strength of the recovery in the United States, sluggish
economic activity abroad, and the persistent high level of the exchange
value of the dollar. For October-November combined, the merchandise
trade deficit was at a record $87 billion annual rate.

II-16
The value of merchandise exports was little changed from the third-
quarter average, or from levels recorded during the previous four quarters.
Merchandise imports in October-November rose to a level 5 percent above
the third-quarter average, despite a decline in oil imports; the increase
in nonoil imports (9 percent) was widespread across commodity groups.
The foreign sector continues to exert a drag on real GNP growth.
The Commerce Department estimated, based on incomplete data, that real
exports of goods and services increased only slightly in the fourth
quarter, while imports climbed by 34 percent at an annual rate. At the
same time, import prices were fairly stable, as they have been throughout
the year, helping to damp domestic price inflation. (A more complete
discussion of international economic development may be found in Part IV.)
Prices
Inflation appeared to be holding steady toward the end of 1983. The
consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in both November and December,
similar to the average monthly increases during the year as a whole.
The producer price index for finished goods showed no net change over
the last two months of 1983 and was up a total of only 0.6 percent during
the year.
The rise in consumer prices during 1983 was similar to the increase
during 1982 and was less than one-third of the peak inflation rates of
1979 and 1980. The increase in the producer price index this past year
was the smallest since 1964. These favorable price developments during
1983 reflected the high levels of slack that had built up earlier in
labor and product markets, softness in food and energy markets, and the
persistent strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets.

II-18
As in 1982, favorable developments in the energy sector contributed to
the general easing of inflation in 1983. Though volatile from quarter
to quarter, consumer energy prices registered a decline of about 1/2
percent over the course of the year. Moreover, except for some recent
weather-related increases in the prices of heating fuels, energy prices
appeared to be holding steady around the turn of the year.
Retail food prices rose only 2.7 percent during 1983, the smallest
advance since 1976. However, unlike energy, pressures on retail food
prices seemed to be developing at year end. Thus, producer price index
for crude foods rose 1.7 percent in December and, because of rising
livestock prices, appears likely to rise sharply again in January. Many
livestock producers are trimming their herds in response to high feed
costs; in addition, severe cold in the Midwest and disease-related losses
of poultry are adding to the current price pressures for livestock products.
Fruit and vegetable crops in Texas and Florida were damaged considerably
during the cold wave of late December; typically, such events lead to
sharp, but temporary, increases in the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables.
The consumer price index for items other than food and energy rose
4.9 percent during 1983; about 1 percentage point less than in 1982.
Price advances slowed especially for services. The fastest increases
for items other than food and energy occurred during the summer and
early autumn, reflecting steep hikes in the prices of used cars and, to
a lesser extent, for new cars and tobacco. However, in November and
December, car prices rose less rapidly than in previous months; and,
overall, the index for items other than food and energy settled back to
about the average rate of increase shown for the year as a whole.

II-19
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage increases for production workers, as measured by the volatile
hourly earnings index, rose from their very low 2-3/4 percent rate of
increase in the middle of the year to a 4-1/2 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter. This pattern in part reflected the collective bargaining
calendar: negotiations took place in many of the weaker industries in
the first half of the year (primary metals, lumber, and construction)
while many of the stronger industries settled during the second half
(telephones, longshoring, and aerospace). Concession bargaining continues,
however, especially in the airline industry. For 1983 as a whole, the
increase in the hourly earnings index slowed to 4 percent from 6 percent
in 1982.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1 growth picked up during December and continued its more rapid
expansion in early January. Growth in the broader monetary aggregates has
been quite moderate, however, and there has been no material change in
reserve market conditions since the December FOMC meeting. Apart from a
year-end spike, federal funds generally have traded in the vicinity of
9-1/2 percent.
The stability of the funds rate, and incoming data pointing to slower
economic expansion and subdued inflation, have eased earlier concerns
about potential tightening actions by the System. Interest rates have
declined across the maturity spectrum generally, in some cases by more than
1/2 percentage point over the intermeeting period.
The effects thus far of the recent decline in rates on financial
flows appear limited. Corporate bond offerings have picked up, but
issuance by nonfinancial firms has risen only moderately from the extremely
low fourth-quarter pace; meanwhile, short-term business borrowing evidently
has continued substantial, although it probably has tapered off from
December's strong rate. Limited information on household borrowing suggests
that consumer installment credit continued to rise briskly through early
January while mortgage flows probably diminished slightly -- at least in
the fourth quarter. Tax-exempt bond issuance has slowed noticeably in
recent weeks, owing largely to the termination of mortgage revenue bond
authority and the lack of action on industrial development bond legislation.
Meanwhile, the federal government's cash needs have remained large, absor-
bing an extraordianry share of overall credit flows.

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Note on the monetary data: Regular benchmark and seasonal factor
revisions are in process. The data reported herein are on an unrevised
basis. A discussion of revisions to the monetary aggregates will be
included in the Bluebook.
M1 accelerated in December to a 6-1/2 percent annual rate of
growth, the first substantial pickup since July. The buildup was concen-
trated in demand deposits, which grew at a 7-1/2 percent rate after
declining in each month since July. A further sizable gain in M1 was
registered in the first two weeks of January.
Despite the acceleration in narrow money, growth in M2 slowed
further in December, to a 5-1/2 percent annual rate. Outflows from savings
deposits increased, while growth in small time deposits moderated; as
in November, time accounts with maturities of six months or less actually
declined, in part because such accounts bear lower interest rates than
longer-maturity deposits. In contrast to the overall deceleration of
interest-earning deposits, MMDA inflows doubled in December. Virtually
all of the MMDA growth was at commercial banks, with most of the increase
occurring in nonpersonal accounts.
M3 growth slowed considerably in December from its robust November
pace as a sharp slowdown in its non-M2 component combined with the fall-
off of M2. At thrifts, issuance of large time deposits moderated further
from the heavy pace of the second and third quarters; but large CDs at
commercial banks increased in November and December for the first time
since MMDAs were introduced at the end of 1982. Overall, commercial
bank needs for purchased funds were smaller in December than in November

because the U.S. government stopped drawing down its cash balance.
Inflows from foreign branches, though reduced, nonetheless remained
substantial.
Growth in bank credit was strong again in December as additional
lending activity offset a reduced pace of securities acquisitions. The
three principal loan groups--business, consumer, and real estate--all
registered more rapid gains in December; preliminary data for large banks
in early January point to continued rapid growth in those loan groups.
Growth in business loans at commercial banks (net of bankers acceptances)
advanced to a 14 percent rate in December, the most rapid pace of the
year. Some of this pickup, however, reflected a substitution of domes-
tically booked loans for loans booked at foreign branches; in mid- to
late December the LIBOR rate rose, temporarily narrowing the prime-LIBOR
spread.
Business Finance
Spending by nonfinancial corporations for inventories and fixed
capital exceeded internally generated funds during the fourth quarter for
the first time in a year. Nevertheless, total business indebtedness
continued to grow slowly, while, despite some decrease in the fourth
quarter, issuance of stocks remained high by historical standards.
The volume of public bond offerings by nonfinancial corporations
fell to a five-year low in the fourth quarter. Such issues were particu-
larly slack in December, as long-term bond rates rose during the month
to their highest levels of the year. Rates have moved back down in early
January and overall bond volume has risen, although nonfinancial issues-
especially industrials--have picked up only moderately.

III-7
The comparatively high level of long-term rates has encouraged
continued reliance on short-term borrowing. Commercial paper issued by
nonfinancial businesses rose sharply during the fourth quarter; the
December increase was the highest in almost two years. The growth of
nonfinancial commercial paper plus business loans--including loans to
U.S. firms by foreign branches of U.S. banks--nearly doubled in December,
reaching 15-1/4 percent at an annual rate. The proportion of total
external business financing raised through short-term borrowing has been
unusually high over the past two quarters in comparison with corresponding
periods in earlier economic upswings. Commercial paper ran off in early
January, however, suggesting that short-term borrowing may be slackening
somewhat from the December pace.
In contrast to nonfinancial firms, financial corporations have been
selling large amounts of long-term debt; indeed, the fourth-quarter total
exceeded the previous peak set in the first quarter of 1983. Although
mortgage-backed bonds have accounted for much of the strength in financial
issues, banks and finance companies have been increasingly heavy issuers.
Prices of common stock have risen on balance since the last FOMC
meeting. By contrast, preferred stock prices have been weak in anticipa-
tion of legislation that would reduce the incentive for insurance companies
to use such issues to shelter income from taxes. Initial public offerings
of common stock remained strong in December.

addition of $6-1/2 billion to its cash balance, which had fallen to an
unusually low level prior to passage by the Congress in late November of
an increase in the federal debt ceiling. The cash balance fell by
$25-1/4 billion during the fourth quarter from the record high third-
quarter level, leaving an end-of-year balance of about $12 billion.
The staff is projecting a combined deficit of almost $58 billion
in the current quarter. Net marketable borrowing is expected to total
about $52 billion, in line with the Treasury's mid-November estimate of
first-quarter financing needs. Continuing the pattern of recent quarters,
most of the borrowing is likely to be obtained from coupon issues.
In December, federally sponsored credit agencies ran off about
$700 million in debt, after raising more than $3 billion in the first two
months of the quarter. FNMA increased its debt by $600 million in
December, primarily to increase its liquid assets. The FHLBs, however,
paid down debt for the second consecutive month, and the Federal Farm
Credit Banks reduced outstanding debt by $1 billion.
State and local sector. Gross offerings of long-term tax-exempt
securities totaled just under $8 billion (seasonally adjusted) in Decem-
ber, a considerably higher volume than in other recent months; for the
fourth quarter as a whole, the volume of such securities was slightly
above the third-quarter pace. Volume was boosted in December as issuers
sought to market debt before year-end, owing to uncertainty about the
tax-exempt status of some private-purpose issues after January 1.

III-10
In particular, pending legislation (the Tax Reform Act of 1983)
would limit the issuance of private-purpose tax-exempt borrowing (other
than financing for single-family housing), effective retroactively to
January 1, 1984. In addition, the authority to issue tax-exempt bonds for
single-family housing lapsed at year-end; although the proposed legislation
likely will extend this authority, the rules that will govern such issues
remain uncertain. Thus far in January, offerings of long-term municipal
bonds have dropped substantially below December levels. No sales of new
private-purpose bonds are expected until the fate of the pending legisla-
tion becomes clear.

Approximately $3 billion of student loan bonds and securities
issued by trust territories were scheduled to come to market in December,

III-11
but eventually were cancelled. The Department of Education was not con-
vinced that the proposed student loan bonds were needed and therefore
refused to grant the necessary approval for a special subsidy. With re-
gard to the territory bonds, the Treasury Department felt that the size of
the proposed issues was abusive of tax-exempt authority and threatened
to block the offerings by asking the Congress to make the Tax Reform Act
prohibition of such issues effective as of December 20.
In mid-December, as the volume of tax-exempt issues increased, inter-
est rates on such securities rose to their highest level since the end of
1982; however, rates fell back rapidly later in the month as cancellations
reduced the supply of offerings. With volume declining substantially in
January, interest rates have continued to drop. By mid-January, the
Bond Buyer revenue bond index was 58 basis points below its recent peak
immediately prior to the December FOMC meeting, and the 20-bond general
obligation index was 44 basis points below its mid-December level.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates and effective yields in primary markets for fixed-
rate conventional home mortgages have declined slightly since the last
FOMC meeting, although both negotiated yields on government-underwritten
loans and secondary market yields of all types have receded more substan-
tially. On fixed-rate conventional home mortgage loans at S&Ls, the
average contract rate on new commitments edged down 7 basis points to its
lowest level in six months. The most prevalent contract rate on regular
FHA-insured loans at mortgage companies has been 12-1/2 percent since

early November, although the effective rate (incorporating points) has
fallen 25 basis points. Discounts on current-coupon GNMA-guaranteed
securities have declined from 5 to 3 points since mid-December, easing
pressure to raise the 12-1/2 percent VA ceiling rate.1
Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have continued to increase in
importance in the market for conventional loans. In December, a record
55 percent of conventional loans closed at all major lenders, and 63
percent at S&La, contained adjustable-rate features.2 Spreads between
interest rates on conventional fixed-rate and adjustable-rate contracts
have widened slightly since the last FOMC meeting, restoring the rela-
tively large initial rate advantages to ARM borrowers that had prevailed
in early December. On one-year ARMs, the rate advantage has returned to
around 2 percentage points. This spread is still somewhat smaller than
the prevailing spread between rates on short- and long-term Treasury
securities.
New mortgage commitments picked up by nearly $2 billion at
federally insured S&Ls in November; furthermore, the stock of outstanding
commitments soared to a new high nearly twice its year-earlier value.
The strength of commitment activity in the face of relatively high
interest rates may partly reflect the large volume of single-family
mortgage revenue bonds floated by states and municipalities during the
1. Discounts on GNMAs issued against pools of FHA/VA loans have been used
as a major factor in determining when ceiling rates on government under-
written loans should be changed by administrative action.
2. FRA/VA loans, which accounted for about one fourth of home mortgage
originations in 1983, are all fixed-rate contracts. A new FHA program to
insure ARM loans, authorized by the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act
of 1983, is not yet in effect.

period from August to October.1 The net increase in S&L total mortgage
assets actually edged off in November, marking the fourth consecutive
month of slowing. Within this total, the net increase in holdings of
mortgage-backed securities was $2.1 billion less than in the previous
month owing partly to a sale by American Savings and Loan Association
of $1.1 billion in such securities to pension funds.
Issuance of federally guaranteed pass-through securities reached a
1983 low (NSA) in December. The decline from November reflected a sharp
drop in GNMAs. GNMA issue volume had been extraordinarily strong during
most of 1983 as the decline in mortgage rates from the 1981-82 highs
encouraged widespread refinancing of FHA and VA loans as well as home
sales. December's decline apparently reflected the backup of mortgage
rates in late summer--a factor that also was largely responsible for the
decline in FHLMC and FNMA securities activity in the last two months of
the year.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment debt increased at an annual rate of 15 percent
in November after rising 16 percent in October. Robust consumer lending
activity at commercial banks and retailers during December and a sizable
gain in unit auto sales suggest that installment credit growth in December
may have exceeded the October-November average. In any case, fourth-
quarter growth appears to have been up substantially from the 12 percent
rate of increase in the third quarter.
1. Two fifths of the single-family mortgage revenue bonds issued in 1983
were floated during the August-October period. Large proportions of
bond proceeds ordinarily are channeled into the mortgage market, through
financial institutions, three to four months after the bonds are issued.

III-16
Commercial banks have led the surge in consumer lending during the
economic upswing. The commercial bank share of the overall increase in
October and November was 56 percent, up from 38 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1982. By contrast, finance company lending to consumers has
slowed sharply, mainly because of the phasing-out of interest rate con-
cessions offered by the auto manufacturers. The finance company share of
net consumer lending dropped from 40 percent in late 1982 to 9 percent in
October-November of 1983.
On balance, consumer credit expanded by 11-1/4 percent during the
first 12 months of the current economic recovery, compared with an
average increase of 7-1/2 percent during the first year of six earlier
post-Korean War recoveries. The surge follows a long interval of slow
growth in consumer borrowing associated with two economic recessions and a
period of credit controls. The strong upturn in 1983 raised the ratio
of consumer debt outstanding relative to disposable income by 0.4 percent-
age point--in contrast to a typical one-fourth point decline in the first
year of recovery; even so, this measure remains about 2-1/2 percentage
points below its 1979 peak. Delinquency rates on consumer loans are at
10-year low.

Foreign Exchange Markets
On balance since the last Greenbook, the foreign exchange value of
the dollar has appreciated nearly 1-1/4 percent on a trade-weighted
average basis, rising in value 1-2/3 percent against the mark but
depreciating by about 3/4 percent against the yen. Most of this net
change occurred during the first three weeks of the period.
In the two weeks from the last Greenbook through the end of the
year, the weighted-average dollar, shown in the upper panel of Chart 1,
declined 1-1/2 percent. This depreciation occurred in the absence of any
significant shifts in economic or political factors and was apparently
attributable to technical factors affecting year-end trading. The advent
of the new year coincided with an abrupt reversal of the dollar's slide.
By the second week of 1984, the dollar had appreciated over 3-1/2 percent
from its year-end trough, touching new record levels for the floating
rate period on a weighted-average basis and vis-a-vis a number of
currencies. This sharp rise was also not apparently related to any
significant new developments in fundamental economic factors.
The announcement in mid-January that U.S. retail sales had risen
only 0.1 percent in December, with its implications of slower U.S. growth
and possibly lower interest rates, stemmed the dollar's earlier rapid
climb. The news marked the commencement of a period over which the
dollar dropped back from its record levels and then fluctuated over a
fairly wide band. There was little net change in the dollar's value for
the final two weeks of the period, while market participants were
reportedly reassessing the outlook for U.S. growth and interest rates.

The most recent two weeks have been characterized by sharp and
irregular jumps in the dollar's value, which frequently occurred without
changes in fundamental economic factors. Intra-day exchange rate
volatility, measured as the percentage difference between high and low
values for the dollar in world-wide trading over a 24-hour period,
regularly exceeded the average daily range for recent months. The daily
range for the dollar/mark rate, for example, exceeded 1 percent on about
half the days of the last two weeks, whereas the average daily range for
the final quarter of 1983 was 2/3 percent.
.On two occasions
during the same period, the New York Trading Desk intervened,
selling a total of $143.4 million. The sales were equally divided
between the accounts of the Federal Reserve System and Treasury.

International lending by BIS-reporting banks. In the third
quarter of 1983, the claims of BIS-reporting banks on the non-OPEC
developing countries increased only $2 billion after adjustment for the
effects of exchange rate changes on the stock of such claims. This rate
of net new lending was less than one-fourth of the quarterly average in
1981 and the first half of 1982, and also was below that of the first
half of 1983 because of the halt, beginning end-May, in further loan
disbursements to Brazil.
The BIS banks' claims on all borrowers rose $29 billion in the
third quarter of 1983 (after adjustment for exchange rate changes), a
rate more than twice as fast as the $11 billion quarterly average in the
first half of the year. About two thirds of this acceleration reflected
a pick-up in interbank lending within the reporting area and to offshore
centers. While there also were increases in the third quarter in the
rate of net new lending to nonbanks in the reporting area, and to
borrowers in the smaller developed countries and in OPEC countries, the
amount of new lending to these borrowers remained small. Claims on
Eastern Europe declined for the sixth time in seven quarters.
The small increase in claims on non-OPEC developing countries was
entirely in claims on Latin America. Claims (not adjusted for valuation
effects) increased $1.1 billion vis-a-vis Mexico, reflecting further
drawings on the $5 billion loan of last March, and increased $0.9
billion vis-a-vis Chile, which drew on a loan received from its credit-
ors in July. Claims on Argentina and Brazil were virtually unchanged.

outside Latin America, following a $3 billion rise in the first half, in
particular reflected run-offs of $1.1 billion in claims on Israel and
$0.5 billion in claims on the Philippines (mostly in claims of
U.S.-chartered banks). These declines offset increases in claims on a
number of other countries, including Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand.
The small but positive net lending to non-OPEC developing
countries by the aggregate of BIS-reporting banks in the third quarter
contrasted with a decline in claims by U.S.-chartered banks alone of $1
billion on a BIS basis. The U.S.-chartered banks' share of total
outstanding bank claims on this group of countries declined to 39-1'/2
percent in September, from 40-1/2 percent in December 1982.

IV-6
U.S. International Financial Transactions
The current account deficit reached $12 billion in the third quarter,
bringing the cumulative deficit for the first three quarters of 1983 to
about $25 billion. For the year as a whole the deficit is estimated to
have totaled a record $40 billion, nearly three times as large as the
previous peak deficits recorded in 1977 and 1978. In 1977 and 1978 the
current account deficits were financed by official capital inflows, as
G-10 countries directly invested the proceeds of intervention purchases in
support of a weak dollar in the United States. In contrast, in 1983 the
deficit was financed almost entirely by private capital inflows as a
strong dollar and OPEC current account deficits kept net foreign official
inflows around $5 billion.
Private capital inflows in 1983 included substantial increases in
holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, deposits at U.S. banking offices,
and U.S. corporate stocks, along with a decline in net claims by U.S.
banking offices on their related foreign offices. Through November, net
acquisitions of U.S. Treasury securities by private foreigners totaled $8.5
billion (line 3 of the summary table on the next page), up from the $6.5
billion total for 1982, while net acquisitions of U.S. corporate stocks
(line 2c) totaled $6 billion, compared with about $3.5 billion the previous
year. Holdings of time and savings deposits at U.S. banking offices by
private foreign nonbanks increased by about $9 billion through November
(included in line 1b), of which about half were placed with IBFs.1/
A large portion of the increase in time and savings deposits may
1/ At the end of November, foreign nonbanks held $20 billion of time
deposits at IBFs and $21 billion of time and savings deposits at other U.S.
banking offices. Deposits held by foreign nonbanks at U.S. banking offices
other than IBFs are included in the monetary aggregates.

reflect capital flight -- $4.6 billion was accounted for by Latin
American countries, and an additional $600 billion by Hong Kong and the
Philippines. The remainder largely was accounted for by residents of Canada
($3.4 billion).
Net claims by U.S. banking offices (including IBFs) on their own
offices abroad declined, on balance, by about $4 billion through the end of
November. Such net claims increased sharply in the first quarter as banks
placed a significant share of inflows to the newly-introduced MMDAS in
placements with foreign banks. However, between the end of the first
quarter and the end of November banks repatriated about $15 billion from
their foreign offices as domestic loan demand strengthened and Eurodollar
rates declined relative to U.S. domestic rates.1/ Partial data for
December suggest that inflows from own foreign offices slowed (line 1 of the
International Banking Data Table). However, this slowing largely reflected
substitution by U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks of borrowing
from unrelated foreign banks for funding from own foreign offices (line 2).
Foreign official capital inflows totaled only about $1 billion through
the first eleven months of the year, as an $8.5 billion reduction in OPEC
holdings of official reserve assets in the United States about offset
increases in holdings of G-10 and several Pacific Basin countries.
Partial data for December, based on holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, indicate an additional net official inflow of about $3 billion,
which was largely attributable to Australia and Singapore and some

rate declined from a peak of 110 basis points in September 1982 to about 40

some special, probably temporary, increases in holdings by a few
industralized countries and certain developing countries that occurred at
year-end.
U.S. official reserve assets increased by about $1 billion in 1983,
as shown in the table below. The U.S. reserve position in the IMF
increased by $4 billion, reflecting the Fund's provision of dollars in
connection with members' drawings along with a $1.4 billion U.S.
reserve-asset subscription in connection with the increase in IMF quotas.
The increase in the reserve position in the Fund was partially offset by
decreases in holdings of foreign currencies and SDRs. Half the $1.4
billion quota increase was paid for in SDRs and half from Treasury
holdings of marks and yen. Holdings of foreign currencies also fell as a
result of the repayment of swap drawings by Mexico and Brazil. In
addition the rise in the dollar's value during the year lowered the
valuation of U.S. foreign currency and other reserve assets. Finally,
during the year the last $1.3 billion in outstanding Carter notes was
redeemed, reducing U.S. official reserve assets and Treasury debt
denominated in foreign currencies by equal amounts (see footnote 2 of the
table).

U.S. Merchandise Trade
While the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in November was less than in
the previous month, for the two months combined the deficit was a record
$87 billion annual rate. In October-November, exports were at about the
same rate as in the third quarter while imports rose by 5 percent.
The essentially unchanged level of exports in October-November
reflects the effects of the sluggish economic recovery in most major
trading-partner countries and the persistent high level of the exchange
value of the dollar which continues to affect adversely the price

competitiveness of U.S. goods. Nonagricultural exports were at about
third-quarter levels. Small increases in exports of machinery
(particularly business machines), chemicals, and automotive parts to
Canada were offset by declines in other commodity categories. By area,
non-agricultural exports to industrial countries increased somewhat in
October-November (largely to Canada) while exports to developing countries
declined a bit.
Agricultural exports were marginally less than in the third quarter
as a large increase in corn exports was offset by declines in other
commodities (particularly soybeans). The increase in corn exports was
partly in price but also in volume as some customers (i.e. Mexico and
Japan) made earlier than usual purchases when the effect of the drought on
supplies began to be apparent; in addition, the U.S.S.R. resumed buying
corn and deliveries to them began in October-November. The decline in
soybean exports in October-November was from an unusually strong
third-quarter level.
The rise in imports in October-November was entirely in non-oil
items, which together rose to a level 10 percent-above the third-quarter
rate. The increase was widespread across commodity categories and in
general reflected the strong pick-up in U.S. economic activity.
Particularly large increases were recorded in machinery, automotive
imports from Japan and Europe, and consumer goods.
Oil imports declined in November following three months of relatively
strong import rates. U.S. domestic oil consumption in October-November
was about 1/2 million barrels per day (mbd) below the third-quarter rate
on a seasonally adjusted basis. This reduction in consumption is largely
attributable to the decreased sale of fuel oil (relatively mild weather

IV-14
in October and early November). There were only small changes in total
private stocks over the period. Oil import prices declined in November to
average $28.16 per barrel; the decline reflects spot market developments.
Spot prices eased from mid-August through mid-December and stabilized
after OPEC and British announcements of intentions to maintain current
contract prices.

Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity in the major
industrial countries has, on balance, continued to rise in recent months.
The pace of the recovery is weakest in Europe. The Canadian recovery has
been the most robust although it is now showing some signs of moderation.
In contrast, the strong rise in Japanese industrial production in
November provides another indication of increasing economic strength in
that country. Recent data on real income and industrial production in
Germany and the United Kingdom suggest continued mild recoveries. Third
quarter figures may signal the beginning of a recovery in Italy.
Economic activity in France has been weak in recent months as the
government's austerity measures are increasingly felt.
Inflation in 1983 was below 1982 levels for most countries. Recent
data generally do not indicate any increase in inflationary pressures.
Inflation slowed during the last two months in France, holding the Q4/Q4
inflation rate for 1983 to under 10 percent. The rate of inflation in
Japan, as measured by the consumer price index, rose in the fourth
quarter, but the wholesale price index fell. Italian consumer prices
also accelerated somewhat in the fourth quarter, but this may represent
seasonal influences.
The Japanese current account surplus is expected to top $20 billion
for 1983. The German current account balance is expected to equal its
1982 surplus of $3-1/2 billion. The trade and current account deficits
in France for 1983 have been sharply reduced compared with the record
deficits of the previous year. Trade and current account balances for
the United Kingdom, however, remain substantially weaker than 1982
levels.

IV-19
The December summit meeting of the heads of government of the
European Community (EC) ended with no agreement on the EC budget crisis.
At the end of last year, expenditures hit the revenue ceiling which is
determined by tariff receipts plus the first 1 percent of Value Added Tax
(VAT) proceeds. In order to avert a crisis this year, EC members must
agree on an increase in VAT revenue contributed to the EC and/or a
restructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which accounts for
two-thirds of EC spending. This dispute is complicated by the
dissatisfaction of the British concerning their large net contribution to
the EC, the disinclination of some member states to pay for the
accumulation of even larger surpluses of certain products, and the
proposed entry into the EC of Spain and Portugal, which would further
strain EC resources.
Individual Country Notes. Economic activity in Japan has continued
to show signs of increasing strength. Third-quarter GNP advanced at a
robust 6 percent rate (s.a.a.r.), following a revised second-quarter
increase of 4-1/2 percent. Although the external sector was still an
important source of strength, as real export demand accelerated to a rate
of growth of over 20 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, the pace of
private domestic demand picked up significantly as well. Consumption
grew at a 4 percent rate, and private investment in plant and equipment
advanced at a rate nearly double that figure. Housing investment, which
has been a conspicuous weak spot during the past three years, also
experienced a quarter of strong growth. Imports pick-up significantly,
reflecting the increased pace of domestic activity. The marked

IV-20
quickening of economic activity appears to have continued into the fourth
quarter. The November industrial production index rose by 2 percent
(s.a.); in the three months ending in November, IP has been advancing at
a nearly 15 percent (s.a.a.r.) pace.
Despite the upturn in activity, price pressures continue to be very
mild. Wholesale prices rose slightly at the end of the fourth quarter,
but average fourth-quarter WPI remained about .6 percent below its third-
quarter level. The CPI declined by 0.5 percent in December. Although
consumer prices have moved ahead somewhat more rapidly in recent months
than earlier, the fourth-quarter average is still only 2 percent above
its year-previous level.
The current account surplus expanded in November by $200 million
(s.a.) in spite of a $400 million expansion in the invisibles deficit.
November's export total was the largest in almost two years. The
current-account surplus is now virtually certain to exceed $20 billion
for all of 1983, while the trade surplus will top $30 billion.
The proposed FY 1984 government budget, announced in January,
allows for an expenditure increase of only 1/2 percent over the previous
year -- the smallest such increase in almost 30 years. In domestic
political developments, the Liberal Democratic Party, after sustaining
large losses in the December 18 general election, continues to control
the Lower House of the Diet by a slender margin through alliances with
independent members.
GNP growth in Germany was flat in the third quarter, but there
have been some encouraging signs more recently. Average industrial

IV-21
production in October and November was more than 1 percent higher than in
August and September and more than 5 percent above last year's average.
The rate of unemployment continued its gradual decline from 9.5 percent
(s.a.) in June to 9 percent in December. The volume of orders showed new
strength toward the end of last year. These data suggest that the
stagnation of GNP in the third quarter may have been a temporary halt in
the ongoing mild recovery. Preliminary GNP data for the fourth quarter
shows a resumption of growth at a 4 percent annual rate, bringing year-
to-year growth for 1983 to 1.2 percent.
Inflation continued at its previous slow pace through December,
when the consumer price index reached a level 2.6 percent above December
1982. Producers prices and wholesale prices at the end of 1983 all were
only slightly above their year-earlier levels.
The current account showed a small surplus in November, bringing
the cumulative result for 1983 to a surplus of about $1 billion. Taking
seasonal factors into account, the data suggest that the current account
surplus for 1983 will be of similar magnitude ($3-1/2 billion) as the
1982 surplus. The trade surplus from January through November last year
was significantly smaller than a year earlier.
On December 15, the Bundesbank announced that its target range of
Central Bank Money (CBM) growth for 1984 would be 4 to 6 percent growth
between 1983-Q4 and 1984-Q4. Last year's target had been 4 to 7 percent,
and the outcome was just below the upper limit. Since last summer,
however, CBM growth has been about 5 percent (s.a.a.r.). The new target,
thus, allows the continuation of the recent course of monetary policy.

IV-22
In France, the effects of the austerity measures initiated by the
government last March have become more evident. Unemployment increased
to 9 percent (s.a.) in November and rose further to 9.1 percent in
December after holding steady at 8.8 percent for six months. Government
programs promoting early retirement and job training have kept the
recorded unemployment rate from rising even more over the past year.
Industrial production declined substantially in September and October but
this decline was reversed in November when it increased by 2.3 percent
(s.a.).
Consumer prices increased 0.3 percent (s.a.) in December. This
brought the 1983 December-over-December consumer price inflation rate to
9.3 percent, exceeding the government's goal of 8 percent. The official
target inflation rate for the corresponding period in 1984 remains 5
percent.
The trade deficit has continued to shrink. In December, the trade
account was in balance. For 1983, the trade deficit was $5.9 billion,
less than half of the record $14 billion deficit recorded in 1982. The
current account deficit in 1983 fell to $4.7 billion from $12.1 billion
the previous year.
Last month, Finance Minister Delors announced a M2 monetary growth
target range for 1984 of 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent. This is well below
the 1983 target of 9 percent growth, and reflects the government's
announced intention of achieving a significant reduction in inflation in
1984. Actual M2 growth in 1983 has been close to its targeted level; as
of October 1983, M2 had grown at an annual rate of 8.7 percent compared

IV-23
with its three-month base period centered on December 1982.
In the United Kingdom, real GDP rose at an annual rate of 3.2
percent during the third quarter, as the recovery in activity continued
at a moderate pace. Industrial production increased 5 percent (s.a.a.r.)
in November. For the three months ending November, IP was 3 percent
above its level for the corresponding period in 1982. Retail sales
figures (s.a.) for November also indicated continued expansion. The
unemployment rate in December remained at 12.3 percent (s.a.); it has
been essentially unchanged throughout the last half of 1983.
The rate of inflation, when measured as the twelve month percentage
change in the retail price index, was slightly above 5 percent in
December, approximately the same rate as in September -November. The
rate of increase of wholesale prices was slightly above that for consumer
prices throughout 1983. In the fourth quarter the WPI was 5-1/2 percent
above its year-earlier level.
In November both the trade balance and the current account
registered surpluses. Nevertheless, both balances have declined sharply
from 1982 levels. Through November the cumulative current account
surplus was $1.9 billion compared with $7.8 billion for the corresponding
period in 1982. The cumulative trade balance for November was a deficit
of $2.3 billion compared with the $2.8 billion surplus for the first
eleven months of 1982.
Nothwithstanding a small decline in Italian industrial production
in October, most observers continue to view the 7.3 percent (s.a.a.r.)
rise in IP in the third quarter as the beginnning of a recovery.

IV-24
Increased energy consumption in the second half of last year and a
continued improvement in consumer surveys support this view. Reflecting
in part seasonal influences, inflation picked up in the closing months of
1983. Consumer prices in the fourth quarter rose at an annual rate of 15
percent, compared with a 9-1/2 percent rate of increase in the previous
quarter; wholesale price inflation behaved similarly. The official
unemployment rate in October rose by 1/2 point to 10.2 percent; the
inclusion of those in "temporary" layoff would raise the rate to 12-1/2
percent.
In late December the Parliament approved a modified version of the
Craxi government's 1984 budget. Further budget savings will be needed to
attain the government's goal of preventing the enlarged public sector
deficit this year from exceeding last year's estimated 90 trillion lire
deficit (about 16-3/4 percent of GDP). On December 30 the Bank of Italy
announced a 12.5 percent target for the growth banking sector credit in
1984, compared with a 14 percent target last year. At the same time, the
Bank announced that it was ending its 10-year old system of ceilings on
individual bank's lending.
The Canadian economy continued to grow in the fourth quarter.
Industrial production posted a 0.5 percent (s.a.) increase in October,
and reached a level 16 percent above its year-earlier level.
Nevertheless, there are emerging signs of a moderation in the rate of
economic expansion. Retail sales increased only fractionally in
October -November, while housing starts declined in October. The
unemployment rate remained unchanged at 11.1 percent during November -

IV-25
December after falling 1.5 percent from its March peak. Although
employment expanded in the fourth quarter, increases in labor
participation rates prevented a further decline in the unemployment rate.
Consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board's survey,
dropped sharply in the fourth quarter from its 18-year peak though it
remains substantially above its average for the past decade.
The inflation rate as measured by the CPI has come down to 4.5
percent in December on a year-over-year basis, less than half the double
digit rates recorded in each of the previous two years. Non-indexed wage
settlements rose 5.8 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, fractionally
below the first and second quarter increases.
Canada's trade surplus expanded in November to $1.4 billion after
falling each month since April. The cumulative trade surplus through
November was $13 billion, approximately 2-1/2 percent below the
corresponding total in 1982. However, trade in transportation equipment
with the United States registered a $1.7 billion surplus over the first
nine months of 1983, an increase of approximately 12 percent over the
corresponding period in 1982.
A wage earner fund system has been adopted in Sweden. Five
investment funds will be created early this year to invest in Swedish
equities. The funds will be financed by a new 20 percent tax on "real"
corporate profits and by a 0.2 percent increase in the payroll tax.
Contributions to the funds will cease in 1990 by which time the funds
will have received $2 billion, equivalent to seven percent of the current
total value of Swedish equities.

IV-26
Each of the five funds will be able to purchase up to eight percent
of an individual corporation's equities. Together with the existing
state national pension fund, they could control up to fifty percent of
the stock of any large Swedish corporation. The nine-member fund boards,
appointed by the government, will include at least five union
representatives.
This controversial measure was passed by a margin of only six votes
in parliament. The most recent surveys show only 27 percent of the
electorate in favor of the proposal. The Conservative, Liberal, and
Centre parties have all promised to abolish the funds if returned to
power.

IV-27
The Debt Situation in Selected Developing Countries
Banks have committed essentially all of the $6.5 billion Brazilian
"Phase II" new money facility and the signing is scheduled to begin on
January 27. Mexico has paid off all private sector interest arrears and
has reached agreement with its bank advisory committee on a new loan of
$3.8 billion. Peru, Argentina and the Philippines are out of compliance
with their 1983 IMF programs and have not yet reached agreement with the
IMF on stabilization programs for 1984, though agreement with Peru is
close. The new Venezuelan administration remains cool to the establish-
ment of an IMF stabilization program. Chile, which has lowered its
inflation rate substantially, expects to complete about half of its 1983
loan reschedulings by the end of this month.
Brazil recorded a trade surplus of $6.5 billion in 1983, which
surpassed the IMF projection of $6 billion and was well above the $1
billion surplus in 1982. The current account deficit was $7.5 billion in
1983, $200 million better than the IMF projection. Prices rose over 200
percent in 1983 on a year-over-year basis, as compared with 100 percent
in 1982. However, the inflation rate in the last two months of 1983 was
substantially less than in the first ten months. The current IMF program
calls for monetary growth of only 50 percent during 1984 and a slight
surplus in the public sector deficit adjusted for inflation. It appears
that the Brazilians have met the net domestic asset and public sector
deficit targets for the end of December 1983. The balance of payments
target (i.e., zero change in net reserves) was not met primarily because
of the delay in signing the bank "new money" facility. Banks have
committed essentially all of the $6.5 billion Phase II "new money"
facility and the signing is scheduled to being on January 27.

IV-28
Mexico and its Bank Advisory Committee have agreed on a new $3.8
billion credit. The loan is for 10 years with 5-1/2 years of grace,
interest at 1-1/2 percent over LIBOR or 1-1/8 percent over prime, and a
facility fee of 5/8 percent. These terms are easier than those of the $5
billion bank loan of 1983 and reflect Mexico's improved performance in
1983. In the first ten months of 1983, Mexico had a current account
surplus of $4 billion, in contrast with a $3.8 billion deficit for all of
1982. Gross international reserves rose by $2.5 billion; net reserves
increased by about $5 billion as central bank debts were repaid. Imports
were cut almost in half in 1983, resulting in a trade surplus estimated
at $14 billion. Private sector interest arrears, which totalled nearly
$900 million a year ago, have been eliminated. About $23 billion in
public sector debts to banks maturing between August 1982 and December
1984 have been restructured, with an eight-year repayment term, including
four years of grace. More than $11 billion in private sector debts have
been restructured on terms of at least six years, including a grace
period of at least three years. The annualized rate of increase in the
CPI in the fourth quarter of 1983 was less than 70 percent, in contrast
with nearly 125 percent in the same quarter of 1982. The public sector
deficit has been reduced, and the authorities hope that real GDP, which
declined by about 4 percent in 1983, will begin to recover in 1984.
The new economic team in Argentina has begun discussions with the
IMF and the banks, aimed at arranging financing for a 1984 gap estimated
at more than $7 billion, not including some $18 billion in external debt
falling due from the end of 1982 through 1984 that Argentina hopes to
restructure. Payments arrears on current transactions were substantially

IV-29
reduced during the first nine months of 1983, but rose sharply to more
than $2.9 billion at year-end, about as high as a year earlier. Interest
payments are current only through early October. A $350 million payment
on the 1982 bank bridge loan, due January 15, has been postponed to
February 15. In office since December 10, the new government has linked
changes in wages, interest rates, and the exchange rate to the projected
rate of inflation and announced on December 30 that it was projecting a
monthly rate of 10 percent for January. Notwithstanding a monthly infla-
tion rate of 18 percent in December, the government decreed an across-
the-board increase in take-home pay of 12 percent for January, lowered
the monthly interest rates on 30-day loans and deposits by three
percentage points to 12.5 and 11.5 percent, respectively, and slowed the
daily depreciation of the official exchange rate by about one-third.
Over the course of 1984, the government proposes to reduce the ratio of
the public sector deficit to GDP from 14 to 4 percent by reducing expen-
ditures by 2 percent of GDP and increasing revenues by 8 percent of GDP.
Peru continues to negotiate with the IMF to replace its three-year
extended arrangement with a new 18-month standby arrangement. Since last
September it has been out of compliance with the arrangement. A Letter
of Intent is expected to be signed soon, but before the signing the IMF
would like to see the elimination of controls on food prices and an end
to the practice of pre-announcing exchange rate devaluations. These
matters are considered very sensitive politically by the Peruvian
authorities, who are also concerned about adding to the rate inflation,
which reached about 125 percent in December 1983 over December 1982.

IV-30
Chile's monthly inflation rate has fallen from a peak of 2.7 per-
cent in August to 0.6 percent in December. The consumer price index in
December was 23 percent higher than in the same month a year earlier,
well within the government's target of 25 percent. The last disbursement
of Chile's $1.3 billion new credit from commercial banks was made at the
end of December. This disbursement required a waiver by the banks of the
condition in the loan agreement that "substantially all" of the resched-
uling agreements be complete by the time of the final disbursement.
Final ratification of the first half of the reschedulings took place on
January 25.
Venezuela will--in all likelihood--be granted a fifth moratorium
on public sector principal payments owed to banks after the current mora-
torium expires at the end of this month. The banks are expected to grant
this extension as a sign of good faith in the newly-elected Venezuelan
government. Because the central bank refuses to authorize the release of
foreign exchange for the payment of private sector external debts,
arrears on private sector interest payments have continued to grow and
are currently estimated to be $750 million, while international reserves
have reached a level of $11 billion. The new administration, which takes
office on February 2, continues to show the same resistance as the
previous administration to establishing an IMF-approved stabilization
program.
Philippine officials are continuing to negotiate a new stabiliza-
tion program with the IMF, but final agreement on a Letter of Intent does
not appear likely until mid-February, with Executive Board approval at
the earliest a month later. On January 11 Governor Laya, tainted by the

IV-31
revelation that Philippine official reserves had been overstated
substantially during much of 1982 and 1983, resigned from the central
bank. Jose Fernandez, formerly head of the Far East Bank, was sworn in
on January 18 as the new Governor. Earlier, on January 12, the 12-bank
advisory committee agreed to extend the moratorium on the repayment of
principal on non-trade external debt to commercial banks for another 90
days from January 16. Philippine officials are scheduled to hold their
first Paris Club meeting with official creditors on February 8. Prime
Minister Virata and Governor Fernandez are currently in Washington and an
attempt will be made to reach agreement on the timing for the establish-
ment of an IMF-approved stabilization program.
