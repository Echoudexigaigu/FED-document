The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent economic information suggests continued strong economic
growth, albeit less rapid than the exceptional pace earlier this year.
Industrial production and payroll employment rose substantially in both
June and July, and business fixed investment and multifamily construction
remained robust through June. Retail sales fell in July; however, this
decline followed two quarters of extraordinary growth in consumption.
Meanwhile, both wage and price inflation continue at moderate rates.
Industrial Production
Industrial production rose 0.9 percent in July after an upward
revised increase of 0.9 percent also in June. The gains in output were wide-
spread among industries. Business equipment production, which has been
growing rapidly for more than a year, rose 1.2 percent in July following
increases of about 1-3/4 percent in each of the two preceding months.
Output of both durable and nondurable materials also rose substantially
in July. Production of durable consumer goods increased sharply, but
nondurables rose little on balance. Auto assemblies, which had declined
to a 7.7 million unit annual rate during the second quarter, increased to
a 7.9 million unit rate in July and are scheduled to remain near this
level, on average, through autumn. Output of construction supplies also
rose moderately, following two small monthly declines.
The increases in production in June and July brought about a sharp
rise in capacity utilization. The manufacturing utilization rate reached
82.6 percent in July, somewhat above the 1967-1982 average. However,
operating rates continue to differ widely by sector. A number of industries
were still showing rates below 80 percent in July, while electrical

machinery, paper, and rubber and plastics were operating at rates in
excess of 90 percent.
Employment and Unemployment
The July employment surveys gave mixed signals, but the weight of
the evidence suggests continued strength in labor demand. The household
survey reported a sharp drop in total employment in July while the payroll
survey indicated a continued expansion; nonetheless, over the April-July
period, both employment series reported a similar, strong increase of
nearly one million jobs. Nonfarm payroll employment, generally the
better indicator of monthly changes in labor demand, rose 300,000 in
July, just a little less than the average gain over the first six
months of 1984. Manufacturing employment rose 105,000, the largest
increase since February, and the workweek remained at a high level. In
other private sector industries, job gains were widespread but
generally were somewhat smaller than in the past few months.
The volatility in the household data also was evident in the unem-
ployment figures; civilian jobless rate jumped 0.4 percentage point,
returning to the May level of 7.5 percent. For most worker groups,
jobless rates retraced declines in June. When viewed over the past
several months, unemployment rates have moved down for adult men and
teenagers, but joblessness among adult women in July was roughly the same
as earlier in the year. Labor force participation, which had climbed
rapidly during the first five months of the year, has held steady since
May.

Personal Income and Consumption
Personal income growth has remained sizable in recent months.
Buoyed by strong gains in employment, wages and salaries rose at a $12-1/2
billion annual rate in the second quarter, and are likely to show another
large increase in July, reflecting the gain in payroll employment. With
inflation moderate, real income growth also has been rapid. Real dispos-
able income rose 7 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter; since
the recovery began, real income has increased at an average annual rate of
6-1/4 percent, more than twice the long-run rate of growth.
With real income growth strong, both the Michigan Survey Research
Center and the Conference Board reported that consumers remained optimistic
in July. Evaluations of expected personal financial situations in the
Michigan survey were still at very favorable levels, although high interest
rates caused a further decline in favorable responses to the questions
about housing in both surveys. Meanwhile, respondents to the Michigan
survey expected price inflation for the coming year to be only 4.1 percent,
the lowest rate expected since the mid-1970's.
Retail sales fell 0.9 percent in July, following rapid expansion
in both the first and second quarters. Excluding autos, gasoline and
nonconsumer stores, the reduction was 0.5 percent. The most pronounced
decline in July was in the general merchandise, apparel, and furniture
and appliance (GAF) grouping. Sales at these stores, which mostly sell
discretionary-type items, fell 3.3 percent following very large increases
on average for more than a year. Sales at gasoline stations dropped 0.6
percent in July, likely reflecting a decline in pump prices, while
food outlays rose 0.4 percent.

Sales of foreign and domestic autos were at a 10.8 million unit
annual rate in July, up from the 10.6 million unit average for the first
half of the year. The pickup in sales was in domestic models, which
were at an 8.4 million unit rate. Imported cars remained near the 2-1/2
million pace seen in May and June. With inventories relatively lean and
domestic production plus captive imports from Canada expected to average
only 8-1/4 million units in August and September, domestic sales are not
likely to be able to exceed the July level for at least several months.
In fact, in the first ten days of August sales dropped back to a 7.4
million unit annual rate.
Business Inventories
Inventory accumulation continued in the second quarter, although
less vigorously than earlier: the book value of total manufacturing and
trade stocks rose at an annual rate of $53.6 billion in the second quarter
compared to $73.7 billion in the first quarter. Most of the difference
was attributable to the swing in auto stocks from accumulation early in
the year to decline in May and June. The second-quarter inventory
expansion was accompanied by relatively strong growth in shipments
and sales; as a result, the overall inventory-sales ratio in recent months
has remained at a level that is quite low by historical standards.
Manufacturers' inventories rose at an annual rate of $32.7 billion
in book value terms in June, comparable to the average rate of increase
from February to May. Recent stock increases have been fairly widespread
by industry, especially in the durable goods category. The rate of
accumulation in capital-goods-related industries has been particularly
notable; given the growth in employment and orders in these industries,

the buildup in inventories apparently reflects continued strength in the
capital goods sector. Despite the recent accumulation, manufacturers
inventories are generally still quite lean relative to sales, with stock-
sales ratios in most industries below their pre-recession lows.
Wholesale and retail inventories declined sharply in June after
showing increases on a book-value basis in the preceding two months.
Four-fifths of the $20 billion (annual rate) decline in June retail
stocks was at auto dealers. General merchandise stores, where stocks had
increased considerably in previous months, also reported sizable inventory
declines in June.
Business Fixed Investment
Outlays for business fixed investment have continued to rise rapidly
this year, and commitments for future spending remain high, as strong
growth in final demand and improvement in corporate cashflow appear to be
offsetting the potential negative impact of high interest rates.
Shipments of nondefense capital goods rose 4-1/2 percent in both
May and June, and were up almost 6 percent for the second quarter as a
whole. The increases were widespread, with both high-technology items,
such as office and computing machines and communication equipment, as well
as heavy industrial machinery posting significant gains. Business demand
for cars and trucks also has continued to expand at a rapid rate. Mean-
while, new orders for nondefense capital goods were up about 5 percent in
the second quarter, and the backlog of outstanding orders continued to
rise, signalling further growth in equipment production in the near term.

Nonresidential construction also has expanded rapidly in the first
half of this year, with nominal expenditures rising almost 20 percent
between December and June. The largest increase over that period was in
construction of stores and warehouses, which had been weak for several
years previously, while office and industrial building also showed sub-
stantial gains. In the second quarter, contracts and permits for new
building were running well above year-earlier levels, indicating a con-
tinued expansion of activity in this sector. The only category of invest-
ment that has been relatively weak so far this year is oil and gas well
drilling, which showed more than its usual seasonal decline in the late
winter and early spring. However, activity in this area has risen somewhat
in recent months.
Housing Markets
The construction of multifamily housing units has continued at a
high rate in the past few months, but the market for single-family homes
has shown signs of weakening. Sales of new single-family homes were flat
in June at a 620,000 unit annual rate, following three consecutive monthly
declines. Responding to the dropoff in the demand for new homes, starts
of single-family houses declined 7 percent in June to a 1.07 million unit
annual rate, bringing the second-quarter total to a level 11 percent
below the advanced first-quarter pace. In addition, newly issued single-
family building permits edged down 1 percent in June, the fourth consecutive
monthly decline.
In contrast to the single-family market, the multifamily sector is
showing surprising strength. Multifamily starts, which had dropped

sharply in May, rebounded in June, and for the second quarter as a whole
were at their highest level in a decade. Issuance of permits for multi-
family construction also has been strong, increasing an additional 5
percent in June.
Despite the rapid growth in multifamily construction, the rental
market has not yet shown signs of oversupply. The vacancy rate for
multifamily rental housing was up just 0.1 percentage point in the second
quarter to 6.7 percent, about equal to the average rate over the past ten
years. The stability in rental vacancy rates is due in part to a resur-
gence in the rate of household formations. According to the Census
Bureau, approximately 1.5 million households were formed in the year
ending last March, a rate more in line with the long-run trend than the
abnormally low 400,000 households formed in the previous year. Most
household formations occur among young adults who are more likely than
other age groups to rent.
The supply of new rental units should expand quickly in coming months.
The pipeline of multifamily projects under construction in April and May
was larger than at any time during the previous four years, and most of
these units will be completed by the end of 1984.
Federal Government
The federal government budget deficit for fiscal year 1984 totaled
$142 billion (unified basis) through June, $16 billion less than in the
comparable nine month period of fiscal year 1983. The narrowing of the
deficit reflects a $48 billion rise in receipts, as the economic expansion
raised tax bases and the initial impact of the tax cuts of the previous
three years tapered off. Growth in receipts would have been still stronger

II-15
but for the favorable inflation developments that have resulted in lower
nominal GNP growth. Outlay increases, however, have remained strong and,
through June, total spending was $32 billion above a year earlier.
Spending for national defense and interest have been the most rapidly
rising outlay components.
For FY1985, only three of thirteen appropriation bills have been
enacted thus far, and negotiations on budget cuts needed to complete the
deficit reduction "down payment" package have stalled. Disagreement over
the size of future defense spending increases appears to be the major
stumbling block.
Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office has released its budget
update. CBO now estimates a deficit of $172 billion in FY1984 and $178
billion in FY1985, and projects even larger deficits for the later years.
Based on the assumption of annual real GNP growth averaging around 3
percent, inflation holding at 4-3/4 percent, and short-term interest
rates declining to 9 percent, CBO projects the deficit rising to $263
billion in FY1989. The CBO projections for 1985 through 1989 are current
service estimates that assume annual real growth in defense spending
authority of 5 percent and maintenance of other federal government
programs at current operating levels.
The administration is expected to release its Mid-session Review
of the Budget soon, updating budget projections for the 1984-1989 period.
The budget figures will incorporate new economic assumptions. The
administration now projects GNP growth to be 6.5 percent from the fourth
quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984, and the GNP price deflator

II-16
is expected to rise 4.4 percent. For fiscal year 1985, the projection
has an annual growth rate of about 4 percent in real GNP, and an inflation
rate of 4.7 percent.
State and Local Government
Activity in the state and local sector has begun to respond to their
much improved financial conditions this year. Spending rose at a 3-1/4
percent annual rate in real terms in the first half of 1984, after showing
little change, on balance, over the preceding two years. The recent
increase has been primarily in construction--particularly in spending for
highways and streets, which rose about 16 percent (in nominal terms)
over the first six months of 1984. State and local sector employment
also has shown a small increase since mid-1983, rising by about 2 percent
following three years of decline.
Exports and Imports
The restraining effect of the external sector on economic activity
has lessened somewhat in recent months. Following a year of little
growth, merchandise exports rose sharply in the first quarter of 1984 and
expanded a bit more in the second quarter, as increasing demand from
major trading-partner countries offset some of the restraining effect of
the high exchange value of the dollar. Imports declined from their
record April level in May and June, but were still extremely high, re-
flecting both the strength of the U.S. economic recovery and the price
competitiveness of foreign-made goods. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit,
at a $105 billion annual rate in the second quarter, was up a little from
the record level posted in the first quarter.

II-17
Prices of nonoil imports have increased during the past three quar-
ters following a year and a half of decline. As measured by unit value
indexes, prices rose about 4-1/4 percent at an annual rate in the first
half of 1984. The price of imported oil in the second quarter, averaging
$28.26 per barrel, was only marginally higher than in the first quarter.
(A more complete discussion of international economic developments is
included in Part IV.)
Prices
Despite the continued strong economic expansion in the first half
of the year, inflation reports generally continue to look good. The
consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in June for the second consecutive
month; producer prices of finished goods, which were largely unchanged in
the second quarter, were up 0.3 percent in July.
Food prices at the consumer level were down somewhat in the second
quarter, after a sharp winter runup. In July, producer prices for food,
particularly at the finished level, turned up. However, much of this
surge, which was mainly in fresh vegetables and meats, may be temporary.
Sharp swings in prices for vegetables are common, and are often reversed
within a few months when new crops are harvested. In addition,
recent price declines in commodity markets for livestock suggest
an easing in meat prices in the near future. In general, pressures on
livestock prices have been less than expected this summer as meat and
poultry marketings were well maintained through the second quarter. Mean-
while, the Agriculture Department is projecting substantial increases in
the next few months in the supply of corn and soybeans--crops that were
in critically short supply coming into the current growing season.

In the energy sector, both domestic and international markets con-
tinue to be influenced by excess supply. Consumer energy prices were
down in the June CPI, with declines for gasoline, fuel oil, and natural
gas. Spot prices of gasoline and fuel oil have declined further since
June, and frequent price discounts for imported crude oil have been
reported.
Excluding food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in June
for the second month in a row. Prices for both new and used cars were
little changed, while prices for apparel and house furnishings declined.
The indexes for apparel and house furnishings, affected in varying degrees
by import competition related to the higher dollar, have been virtually
flat over the past 12 months. Recent increases in service prices have
remained around 0.4 percent a month, similar to those earlier in the year
(except for January when the index was boosted by large adjustments in
telephone rates associated with the breakup of AT&T). Overall, the rise
in the CPI less food and energy items has been about 5 percent at an
annual rate so far this year, the same as in 1983.
At the producer level, capital equipment prices rose 0.2 percent in
July after being flat in June. Prices of intermediate materials (less
food and energy) were unchanged in July after increasing at an average
annual rate of about 3 percent over the previous year and a half.
Wages and Labor Costs
Despite continued strong growth in labor demand, wage inflation
moderated further during the first half of 1984. The comprehensive
employment cost index showed private wage and salary rates rising 4 per-

cent at an annual rate in the second quarter, about the same as in the
first quarter and nearly 1 percentage point less than in 1983. The
restraint has been fairly widespread among worker groups. The main
exception is professional and technical employees, who continued to receive
wage increases averaging 6-1/2 percent in the first half of 1984. In
contrast, wage changes for blue-collar workers have averaged less than 4
percent at an annual rate so far this year.
The moderate rate of wage inflation in the first half of the year
in part reflected continued restraint in major collective bargaining
agreements. Negotiated wage adjustments in private industry, exclusive
of COLAs, averaged 2.6 percent in the first contract year and 2.8 percent
annually over the life of the contracts-the same as those negotiated in
1983. Although initial pay cuts or freezes were less pervasive during
the first six months of 1984, the average size of new settlements declined
in cases where workers did receive an increase. Adjustments under
previously negotiated multiyear contracts also have been small this year.
As a result, overall wage inflation for union workers is now running
under 4 percent, a little less than the rate for nonunion workers.
For the private nonfarm sector as a whole, hourly compensation,
which includes both wages and employer contributions to payroll taxes and
employee benefits, rose at just a 3-1/2 percent annual rate in the second
quarter of 1984. Meanwhile, productivity advanced at a brisk 3 percent
annual rate in both the first and second quarters, in part reflecting
strong output gains. The moderate increases in hourly compensation
coupled with the cyclical rebound in productivity have held the rise in
unit labor costs to just 1-3/4 percent over the first half.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Stock and bond markets have rallied over the intermeeting period.
The Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and recent indicators of economic
activity, prices, and money were widely interpreted as limiting the likeli-
hood of substantial increases in short-term interest rates in the near
future. From their spring peaks, yields on Treasury notes and bonds have
fallen 100 to 150 basis points with more than half the decline coming since
the last FOMC meeting, and major stock price indexes have surged more than
10 percent since late July on record volume.
The gains in long-term markets occurred despite a continued upward
drift in the federal funds rate, which has been above 11-1/2 percent most
recently. The funds rate has risen more than a quarter of a percentage
point since the last FOMC meeting, and a percentage point over the past four
months, although adjustment plus seasonal borrowing has remained consistently
close to the $1 billion level, as banks have become increasingly cautious
in their use of the discount window. Three-month Treasury bill yields also
have moved up in the intermeeting period, partly reflecting replenished
supplies following earlier paydowns due to debt ceiling constraints, while
rates on other securities of comparable maturity declined. Some easing of
concerns about bank and other private credits contributed to the further
narrowing of risk premium spreads between private and Treasury rates.
M1 declined in July following very rapid growth in the previous
month, and M2 grew sluggishly as the weakeness in M1 more than offset
some pickup in nontransactions M2. Through July, both aggregates remained
comfortably within their annual ranges, with M1 slightly above and M2 below
the respective midpoints. In contrast, M3 continued to expand at its June

pace and remained above its annual range, as the runoff of term RPs and
Eurodollars slowed markedly.
In line with the vigorous business expansion, credit market debt
continued to grow rapidly, although there are some signs of a modest
slowing. Business short-term borrowing, particularly at banks, eased
considerably in June and July, owing in part to a reduced need for merger
finance, and was only partially offset by a pickup in long-term borrowing
following the interest rate declines. The flow of new mortgage commitments
at S&Ls and the growth of consumer installment credit outstanding moder-
ated in June after huge increases in May, though both were still as rapid
as earlier in the year. On the other hand, the federal government has
continued to borrow heavily, and state and local governments, resuming
issuance of single-family housing and industrial development bonds, have
stepped up their borrowing. Overall, domestic nonfinancial debt expanded
at an estimated 13 percent annual rate in July, only slightly below its
second-quarter pace, while borrowing by nonfederal sectors is estimated to
have eased more than 1-1/2 percentage points, to an 11-3/4 percent rate.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 contracted about 2 percent at an annual rate in July after expanding
briskly at an 11-1/2 percent rate in June. Earlier interest rate increases
may well have contributed to M1's weakness last month. After slowing in
June, other checkable deposits-believed to be more interest-sensitive than
other M1 components--declined for only the third month since NOWs were
extended nationwide. Demand deposits also fell, reversing part of their
huge increase in June. To a small degree, seasonal adjustment distortions

II-4
may have overstated M1 weakness in July, as social security cost of living
adjustments and personal tax cuts of recent years likely have tended to
boost the July seasonal factors.
Reflecting the weakness in M1, M2 growth slowed in July, to about
a 5 percent annual rate. Growth of nontransaction balances in M2 actually
picked up, but only to a 7 percent rate, about in line with the subdued
pace of the first half of the year. There was considerable divergence in
the growth rates of the nontransactions components. Money market mutual
fund (MMMF) shares continued to grow at a double digit pace as they have,
on average, over the past several months, and small time deposits accelerated
to a 24 percent rate. However, savings deposits and MMDAs contracted again
last month. The apparent reallocation of funds within these deposit cate-
gories suggests that depositors were responding to relative interest rate
incentives: as short-term market rates have risen, MMMF yields have become
more attractive relative to lagging rates paid on bank money market deposits,
and longer-term time deposits rates have been relatively high reflecting
the steep yield curve.1 Overnight RPs and Eurodollars were little changed
in July, after a sizable June decline. The leveling off of overnight RPs
likely was related to a cessation of runoffs in bank holdings of government
securities.
M3 growth in July was about unchanged from the June pace, as somewhat
faster growth in its non-M2 component offset slower M2 expansion. The
large CD component of M3 continued to grow rapidly, though off somewhat
1. In July, increased competition for small time deposits led to a rate
skirmish among New York City depositories, raising yields of 6-month deposits
by 150 basis points during the month while yields of large CDs were declining.
These rate increases appear to have affected the composition of deposit growth
in this region, favoring time deposits at commercial banks, but not the
growth of M2 overall.

III-5
from the pace of the previous two months as CD issuance by thrift insti-
tutions moderated. An apparent easing in the growth of other managed
liabilities at thrifts suggests some moderation in credit expansion, total
deposits at thrifts continued to advance strongly, as thrifts gained the
bulk of the July increase in inflows to small time deposits.
Commercial bank credit accelerated to a 9 percent annual rate in July
after a pause in June. This July pickup was largely accounted for by a
moderate increase in holdings of Treasury securities, and a levelling off of
the volatile security loan category following sharp declines in June. The
firming in Treasury security holdings at banks was largely in trading
accounts and may reflect lowered rate expectations by these institutions.
Growth in business and consumer loans showed little change from June, and
expansion in real estate loans was the smallest thus far in 1984.
Business Finance
Borrowing by nonfinancial firms has continued rapid early in the
third quarter, bolstered by further increases in capital spending that
again substantially outpaced growth in internal funds. Nevertheless,
credit demands appear to be moderating as cash needs to finance mergers
lessen.
The composition of business borrowing has changed somewhat since last
quarter. Business loans at banks slowed appreciably in June and have not
rebounded. Much of the weakness is accounted for by reduced borrowing to
finance large mergers; part of the merger-related borrowing has been
shifted to the commercial paper market where issuance remains strong and
some to the bond market. Total bond offerings have increased sharply as
corporations have taken advantage of lower bond yields; the Board's single

A utility bond rate has fallen 115 basis points over the past six weeks.
However, through July, effective maturities of bond issues shortened further,
as variable rate and extendible note issues continued to increase in volume.
A stronger movement toward a lengthening of overall debt maturities appeared
in early August, as a number of bond issues maturing in 15 years or more
were marketed successfully.
The stock market rally also has been impressive. Since late July,
share prices have risen enough to offset losses accumulated over the previ-
ous six months. The bulk of the gain occurred during the first three
trading sessions of August. Trading volume was enormous, and activity
on two of the days set records. Before the rally, new issue volume had
slowed to a trickle, but the rise in share prices brought with it a small
increase in new equity sales in early August. Share price gains have been
widespread, and the more optimistic outlook for interest rates among market
participants has been especially helpful to bank and thrift stock prices,
which have risen relative to broad market indexes in recent weeks. On
average, however, prices of depository institutions' shares still show
about a 10 percent relative decline since early May.
Yields of Eurodollar bonds have risen relative to those of
U.S. Treasury notes since the repeal of the 30 percent withholding tax.
The repeal has not stimulated any outpouring of corporate issues tailored
for foreign investors or any noticeable increase in foreign demand for
Treasury securities. Issuers and investors are generally waiting for the
Treasury to loosen the strictures of the Tax Compliance Act of 1983 that
established a 20 percent backup withholding tax for investors who fail to
provide an adequate identification, which many Euro-investors wish to avoid.

Government Finance
Federal sector. The staff is projecting for the third quarter a
combined deficit of about $40 billion, bringing the total for fiscal 1984
to $186.9 billion. In addition, the Treasury is expected to build up its
cash balance over the quarter by $6-1/2 billion, which will leave an
end-of-quarter balance of around $20 billion. The Treasury probably will
meet these financing needs by borrowing $52 billion, net, from the public.
About $36 billion of the $49 billion in marketable borrowing will be
raised in auctions of coupons. The remaining $13 billion of new cash will
be raised in bill auctions, in contrast to the net paydown of bills last
quarter. Although the Treasury is considering a number of innovations in
debt management, these are not likely to affect market offerings until late
in the quarter, at the earliest. A non-binding Senate resolution expressed
disapproval of any use of Treasury-related bearer bonds. The outstanding
public debt will approach its legal ceiling in late August and early Sep-
tember, but any changes in financing schedules should be slight; enough
room for maneuver exists that the Treasury decided not to press for new
legislation until Congress reconvenes after Labor Day.
Borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies burgeoned in the
second quarter and appears to be strengthening further in the third. Housing
agencies are accounting for the bulk of this financing; the Federal Home
Loan Banks are experiencing substantial demand by thrifts for advances, and
portfolio acquisitions of mortgages by Fannie Mae remain robust. Several
of the Home Loan Banks, most importantly the FHLB of San Francisco, have
been pricing their advances attractively, at a cost to S&Ls roughly equiva-
lent to the cost of large CD financing for the biggest institutions, which

is a bargain for the smaller ones. Borrowing by the Farm Credit Banks on
the whole remains sluggish, owing to depressed agricultural conditions.
Sallie Mae issued $2 billion of 30-year zero-coupon bonds which raised about
$75 million at an interest cost well below the Treasury's. The debentures
were sold mainly in Japan and Europe, and were the first by a federal agency
to be sold through foreign dealers since the withholding tax was repealed.
State and local sector. Issuance of tax-exempt bonds picked up in
July; gross offerings totaled $7.2 billion, compared with a $5.7 billion
monthly average over the first half of the year. Most of the July increase
reflected a surge in the volume of single-family mortgage revenue bonds
after the authority to issue these bonds was renewed by the Deficit Reduction
Act of 1984. Such issues totaled $2-1/2 billion in July, and the volume
appears to have slowed only moderately thus far in August. Offerings of

industrial development bonds also rose in July, as the recently passed
legislation ended considerable uncertainty about new restrictions and
procedures. While these bonds are typically difficult to identify, the
staff estimates that roughly $1 billion were sold in July.
As the volume of private-purpose bonds increased in July, some issuers
refrained from marketing debt, apparently fearing pressures on rates. As
a result, total volume remained below expectations. Rates on tax-exempt
bonds, which increased around 90 basis points in May and June, now have
retraced those increases. The Bond Buyer 30-year revenue index stood at
10.29 percent in mid-August, about 60 basis points below the level just
before the July FOMC. The decline in municipal bond rates has been about
in line with the reduction in other long-term rates, and the ratio of tax-
exempt to taxable yields has been little changed in recent weeks.
Mortgage Markets
Yields on secondary mortgage market instruments have declined 1/2 per-
centage points or more since the July FOMC meeting, and primary market
rates also have begun to fall. On fixed-rate loans, contract and effective
rates on new commitments for conventional home mortgages at S&Ls have de-
clined only a little during the intermeeting period, but a sample of large
mortgage companies reported a drop in the effective rates that they quote
on FHA and conventional mortgages that was consistent with the falloff in
secondary market yields. As price discounts on GNMA pass-through securities
dropped to less than 1 point, the ceiling rate on VA-guaranteed loans was
cut by 50 basis points to 13-1/2 percent, effective August 13.

In the secondary market for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), re-
quired yields posted by FNMA for mortgages with annual interest rate
adjustments have moved down 35 basis points since the last FOMC meeting.
ARMs have continued to remain popular in the primary market; in early July,
two-thirds of conventional home mortgages closed at major lenders--73 per-
cent at S&Ls--contained adjustable-rate features. The record share gar-
nered by ARMs was attributable in part to the relatively wide spread between
interest rates on fixed- and adjustable-rate contracts,1 as well as to the
practice by some lenders of approving ARM loans on the basis of first year
payment-to-income ratios, using the same standards as for fixed-rate loans.

fixed-rate loans and for adjustable-rate loans with no interest rate cap was

year, based on FHLBB data.

Anticipating that delinquency rates will be higher on ARMs, several mortgage
insurance companies have announced that, effective in August, their premiums
on ARMs would be higher than on comparable fixed-rate loans.
New mortgage commitments at federally insured S&Ls were down 8 percent
in June, possibly foreshadowing some slackening of lending growth in sub-
sequent months. Scattered reports suggest a slowing of mortgage credit
demand in July. However, during May and June, residential mortgage debt
outstanding increased at its most rapid pace in more than 4-1/2 years (see
chart on page III-13). It expanded at an average annual rate of 12-1/2
percent in these two months, and home mortgage debt grew nearly as rapidly.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit outstanding slowed in June to a
22 percent annual rate from the torrid 30 percent pace in May, but was about
in line with growth earlier in the year. June's decline is consistent with
slowing growth in retail sales that month, but for those items that rely
heavily on credit, sales increases were substantially larger in June than
in May. However, discrepancies between month-to-month changes in sales and
credit growth are not uncommon. Installment lending at commercial banks is
estimated to have advanced by about $3.8 billion in June--also down appreci-
ably from the May increase and more in line with average monthly gains earlier
in the year. Consumer loans of all types at commercial banks continued to
grow rapidly in July.
Interest rates on auto loans at major captive finance companies
continued to creep up in June, reaching 14.3 percent on new-car loans and
17.6 percent on used-auto loans. Even with the recent increases in consumer

interest rates, the averages have remained well below their historic highs
in late 1981 to mid-1982.
Consumer interest rates also are below usury ceilings in most states.
On the whole, state usury ceilings appear to be a long way from becoming
much of a constraint on the availability of consumer credit. For new-auto
loans, the most common ceilings are between 18 and 20 percent; only three
states have a ceiling of less than 18 percent. The most common ceilings
for installment loans are 18 or 21 percent; a number of states have no
ceiling and in only a few are the ceilings below 18 percent.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting, the trade-weighted value of the dollar
has risen about 1 percent on balance, despite declines in longer-term
dollar interest rates relative to foreign rates and little change in
short-term interest-rate differentials. Market commentary suggests that
a downward revision in expectations for U.S. inflation offset to some
extent declines in nominal U.S. interest rates and thereby helped
maintain demand for the dollar. The dollar also derived support from
data for June that showed a second consecutive monthly trade deficit
considerably smaller than the consensus expectation. The dollar con-
tinued to be buoyed by an impression among market participants that the
United States is stronger economically and more stable politically than
most other major countries -- particularly European nations, which in
recent months have experienced labor strife, relatively weak growth, and
symptoms of dissatisfaction with governing parties. The dollar moved up
about 1-1/2 percent against the mark and other EMS currencies during the
period, but gained only about 1/2 percent against the yen and sterling,
and declined against the Canadian dollar.
The dollar, while rising on balance, has exhibited considerable
volatility in the intermeeting period amid shifting opinion about the
outlook for interest rates in the United States. Exchange markets have
been sensitive to Federal Reserve testimony and to other indications of
the stance of monetary policy. The dollar has declined when new data
have offered some sign of a slowing in U.S. economic activity.

Sterling was aided early in the intermeeting period by settlement
of the U.K. dockworkers' strike, which had generated concern that the
ongoing coalminers' strike might broaden into a general political assault
by labor. Late in the period, the pound derived support from indications
that oil prices might cease to weaken. With the pound stronger and with
growth of sterling M3 slowing, the Bank of England partially reversed the
large increase in its money market dealing rates that it had implemented
early in July. Major U.K. banks responded with similar partial
reversals, cutting their base lending rates by 1 percentage point to 11
percent.

IV-3
The Canadian dollar turned around and appreciated about 1-3/4
percent against the dollar as favorable interest-rate differentials and
some good economic statistics drew demand to the Canadian currency.
Toward the end of the intermeeting period, money market interest rates
eased in Canada and several major Canadian banks reduced their prime
rates 50 basis points to 13 percent, whereupon the Canadian currency
stabilized against the dollar.

IV-4
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Despite the large deficit in the U.S. current account, data
currently available for the second quarter of 1984 show only small net
capital inflows. (See table on U.S. International Transactions.) More
complete information will be released by the Department of Commerce in
late September, but it seems likely that the statistical discrepancy in
the accounts will remain positive and high, obscuring the channels
through which the U.S. current account deficit has been financed in the
first half of 1984.
Official institutions reduced their asset holdings in the United
States again in the second quarter. (See line 4.) The OPEC countries have
decreased their holdings by over $5.0 billion since the beginning of the
year. The G-10 countries also reduced their holdings in the United
States in the second quarter,
Partial information indicates
only small net changes in official reserve holdings in the United States
in July.
The recorded change in the net positions of banking offices in the
United States swung from an inflow of $13 billion in the first quarter to
an outflow of $2 billion in the second quarter. (See line 1.) This
reversal was primarily the result of an increase in claims on
unaffiliated banks (net) and on nonbanks in foreign countries. U.S.
banks' liabilities to private nonbanks in foreign countries increased by
over $4 billion in the second quarter, up from an increase of almost $3
billion in the first; Mexican residents alone increased their recorded
holdings by $900 million.

IV-5
The net claims of U.S. banking offices on affiliated foreign banks
and IBFs were unchanged in July, after a sharp increase in June, perhaps
indicating that the disruptions to funding patterns associated with the
Continental crisis have lessened. (See International Banking Data Table,
line 3.) The Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbank residents were also
little changed in July. (See line 5.)
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities were very
large in the second quarter and totaled $8 billion for the first half of
1984. (See line 3 of the Summary Table.) Almost a quarter of this total
for the half-year was accounted for by the World Bank. The rest was
largely accounted for by a few countries: Switzerland ($3 billion), Japan
($1 billion), the United Kingdom ($750 million), and the Netherlands
Antilles ($300 million). Most of these purchases were not subject to the
withholding tax on interest payments to foreigners, repealed at
mid-year, either because the purchases were of short-term Treasury
obligations (Switzerland), or because withholding tax rates were reduced
to zero by bilateral treaties (the United Kingdom and Netherlands
Antilles). It is unclear at this time how large an impact repeal of the
withholding tax will have on future sales of Treasury debt to foreigners.
Press reports indicate that Treasury Secretary Regan has decided not to
issue bearer Treasury bonds to foreigners, but that a group headed by
Salomon Brothers plans to sell CATs to foreigners in bearer form. The
Senate passed a resolution on August 10 calling on the Treasury to halt
the sale by dealers of any bearer securities backed by U.S. government
securities. The Treasury is expected to issue new rules governing the
sale of bonds to foreigners during the week of August 20th.

U.S. merchandise trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in June was not substantially
different from May; the resulting second-quarter deficit was close to the
first-quarter rate.
Nonoil imports continued to decline in June from their peak April
amount, but the average for the second quarter was still at a near-record
level. The volume of nonoil imports in the second quarter was 13 percent
higher than in the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting the continued
strength of U.S. economic activity and the price competitiveness of
foreign-made goods. By area, gains in nonoil imports since the fourth
quarter of last year were greater from industrial countries than from
other countries.

The increase in oil imports in the second quarter was almost
entirely in volume in response to rising U.S. demand. There were only
minimal reactions to the hostilities in the Persian Gulf--U.S.
inventories increased somewhat but spot prices actually declined through
July. A rise in the import price of oil in the second quarter reflected
the higher spot prices recorded earlier in the year.

Nonagricultural exports increased in the second quarter as most
major commodity categories were near or above levels reached in the first
quarter. Since the fourth quarter of last year, most of the rise in
nonagricultural exports has been to industrial countries, notably
non-automotive exports to Canada.
Agricultural exports, particularly shipments of corn and soybeans,
declined from first-quarter levels. Most of the decline was in volume.
Higher export prices of soybeans in the second quarter, partly related to
low stocks, discouraged demand from Western European and other buyers.
Low stocks also contributed to rising corn export prices, which reduced
demand from customers in developing countries. For wheat, the volume of

IV -10
shipments was at about the same level as in the first quarter; the major
customers were Japan, China and the U.S.S.R. Because of large world
supplies, export prices of wheat continued to decline. In July and early
August the U.S.S.R. contracted for an unprecedented 8 million metric tons
(MMT) of grain from the United States. Part of that amount, 1.9 MMT, was
credited against the current agreement-year (which ends September 30),
and the remainder (6.0 MMT) was carried forward and credited against the
October 1984-September 1985 agreement year. Under the Long-term Grain
Agreement, the U.S.S.R. agreed to purchase a minimum of 9 MMT and a
maximum of 12 MMT of grain per year (October 1 through September 30).
For the year ending September 30, 1984, purchases by the U.S.S.R. will
total 12.9 MMT (the United States having authorized 0.9 MMT over the
agreement level).

IV -11
Foreign Economic Developments. The pace of the recovery in the
major foreign industrial economies remains uneven. The picture has been
complicated by industrial disputes in Germany and the United Kingdom
which have depressed production in those countries in recent months. The
sharp drop in German industrial production in June should be largely
reversed following the settlement of the metalworkers' strike in July.
However, there were indications of sluggish German activity even before
the strike. French economic activity remains weak and a government
reshuffle appears to have left the policy of economic austerity intact.
Economic expansion in Italy has continued with real GDP rising by 3.2
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter. The Canadian recovery has also
continued, but only at a pace about half that of the 7 percent real GNP
growth rate recorded last year. Only in Japan, where industrial
production is 12 percent above year-earlier levels, could the recovery
now be called robust.
Inflation rates remain low or declining in the major industrial
countries. Year-over-year consumer price inflation rates have been
reduced by over a percentage point since the beginning of the year in
Italy, France and Canada. The U.K. inflation rate has remained nearly
unchanged at about 5 percent over this period. Consumer price inflation
rates in both Germany and Japan are under 3 percent.
The Japanese external surplus has continued to expand. For the
first half of 1984 Japan's current account surplus rate of $33 billion
(s.a.a.r.) substantially exceeded that of the previous year. In
contrast, Germany's cummulative current account surplus in the first half
of this year was substantially lower than that recorded in the comparable

period last year.
Industrial production in Japan rose in the second quarter by 2.6
percent (s.a.) to a level almost 12 percent above that of the
corresponding period last year. Other indicators provide mixed signals
about the pace of activity for the remainder of this year. The Economic
Planning Agency's index of leading indicators declined in May, reflecting
an increase in the inventory to sales ratio for raw materials, declines
in new machinery orders and new passenger car registrations, and slower
growth of M2. On the positive side, new housing starts increased and the
number of business failures declined in May. In June, housing starts
rose again, while new construction orders dropped.
Inflation in Japan remains low. Wholesale prices were essentially
unchanged in the second quarter -- as in the first -- and the Tokyo
consumer price index rose by less than 3 percent in the year ending in
July. The current account surplus expanded in June, bringing the
cumulative surplus this year to $32.8 billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with a
$21 billion surplus in 1983. Most of this increase is accounted for by a
rise in the trade surplus.
On July 31 the cabinet approved guidelines for FY1985 budget
requests from ministeries and agencies. The guidelines imply an increase
of almost 1 percent in ministerial budgets compared with a 1 percent rise
in the guidelines and an actual change of about zero in FY1984. Most
categories of ordinary expenditures will in principle be held to 10
percent below the level of the current fiscal year's budget, to be offset
by increases in expenditures for defense, energy, foreign aid and public
works spending.

IV -16
A seven-week strike by German metalworkers ended in the first
week of July. The strike had laid off up to 450,000 workers and had shut
down the automobile industry. The terms of the settlement of the strike
are likely to become a guideline for other contract negotiations. For
the period from July 1984 to April 1985, the settlement provides for a
3.3 increase in weekly wages. From April 1985 to October 1986, weekly
wages will increase another 2.2 percent and the average contracted work
week will be reduced from 40 to 38-1/3 hours (4.2 percent).
The nearly 9 percent (s.a.) drop in industrial production in June
appears to reflect mainly the impact of the metalworkers' strike.
However, even before the strike there were indications that the pace of
the recovery had slowed. Industrial production fell almost 4 percent
(s.a.) in March and had not fully recovered by May. The rate of
unemployment remained at 9.3 percent (s.a.) in July, only slightly below
its most recent peak level.
Consumer prices declined by 0.2 percent (n.s.a.) in July, reducing
the year-over-year consumer price inflation rate to only 2.2 percent.
The current account moved back into deficit by $1.2 billion (n.s.a.) in
June. For the first half of 1984 as a whole, the cumulative current
account surplus was only $500 million, compared with a surplus of nearly
$3 billion in the corresponding period last year.
In Canada, the economic expansion continued at the reduced pace
evident in the first quarter where real GNP grew at an annual rate of 3.2
percent (s.a.) compared to 7.1 percent real growth in the year ending in
the fourth quarter of 1983. In May, the level of industrial production
remained fractionally above the first quarter average despite a monthly

IV -17
decline of .4 percent (s.a.). The broader GDP measure posted an increase
of .5 percent (s.a.) in May. There are some signs that investment is
beginning to grow after falling throughout much of 1983. Real investment
grew at an annual rate of 4.5 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter largely
on the strength of growth in machinery and equipment expenditures. A
growth in new and unfilled orders in May, particularly for durable goods,
suggests further advances in machinery and equipment purchases. The
unemployment rate declined in June and July reaching 11.0 percent (s.a.)
after steadily rising throughout the first five months of 1984. The
current unemployment rate compares with a recession peak of 12.8 percent
in December of 1982.
Inflation has continued to slow in the second quarter with consumer
prices only 4.6 percent above their level in the second quarter of 1983.
This compares with a 5.2 percent year-over-year rise in consumer prices
in the first quarter. The accumulated trade surplus stood at $7.8
billion in June, virtually the same as that recorded in the comparable
period last year.
Industrial production in France increased by 3 percent (s.a.) in
May, completely reversing the sharp decline of the previous month.
Despite this increase, May's industrial production figure was only 1.3
percent above its year-earlier level. Real GDP declined by 0.3 percent
(s.a.) in the second quarter. The unemployment rate resumed its rise in
June, moving up 0.1 percentage point to 9.9 percent (s.a.), after holding
steady in May. Consumer prices increased by 0.5 percent in June as the
year-over-year inflation rate declined slightly to 7.7 percent, still
well above the government's 5 percent inflation target for 1984.

IV -18
After a small surplus in May, the trade deficit swung back into
deficit by $600 million (s.a.) in June. For the first half of 1984,
trade was in deficit at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.4
billion, only slightly below the $5.9 billion deficit rate for 1983 as a
whole.
On July 17 French President Francois Mitterrand accepted the
resignation of Pierre Mauroy as Prime Minister and appointed Laurent
Fabius, formerly Minister of Research and Industry, to succeed him.
Statements by the new Prime Minister, as well as the composition of his
new Cabinet, suggest a continued commitment to the government's policy of
relative macroeconomic austerity.
Industrial production in the United Kingdom registered a slight
increase in June after falling in each of the five previous months. In
the second quarter, industrial production stood 2.8 percent (s.a.) below
its first quarter level. This fall was at least in part the result of
the coal miners' strike which has been going on since mid-March.
Although the production of coal has been substantially reduced, the
effect of this strike on other industries has so far been limited. The
resolution of the strike, however, does not appear imminent as
negotiations between the miners union and the National Coal Board have
again broken down.
In June, retail prices rose to a level 5.1 percent above that of a
year earlier, a rate of inflation that has been about unchanged since the
start of the year. The likelihood that the July increase in the general
level of interest rates would lead to larger subsequent increases in the
retail price index (through higher mortgage rates) has been reduced as

IV -19
the Bank of England, by lowering its shortest-term intervention rate from
12 to 11 percent in two steps on August 8 and 9, has signalled its
willingness to accommodate some decline in interest rates. Exchange rate
pressures had led the Bank of England to increase its intervention rates
by about 3 percentage points (to 12 percent for the shortest-term rate)
in early July.
The U.K. trade account was in deficit in June while the current
account registered a small surplus. For the second quarter as a whole,
the trade account deficit equalled $1.8 billion (s.a.); the corresponding
current account deficit equalled $800 million (s.a.). The recent growth
in consumption has led to a rise in imports while the strike-induced
substitution of oil for coal for domestic use has reduced energy
exports.
Real GDP in Italy rose by 3.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter despite a slight decline in real investment spending. Although
no consumption data have been released, the increased optimism of
consumers as reported in surveys suggests that private consumption
spending played an important role in the first quarter gain. Net exports
made only a very small contribution to GNP growth. Industrial production
(n.s.a.) in the first 6 months of this year was about 3 percent above
that for the same period last year.
Inflation as measured by the consumer price index remains at its
lowest level since the early 1970's. In July, consumer prices advanced
0.3 percent (n.s.a.) to a level 10.5 percent above that of the previous
July. This year-on-year increase is the lowest since 1973. The trade
deficit in the first 5 months of this year was $4.5 billion (s.a.),

IV -20
compared with a $3.6 billion deficit in the corresponding period of
1984.
On July 20 the Bank of Italy informed the commercial banks that
they could not increase their foreign indebtedness beyond the level of
June 30. The ostensible reason for this ceiling is to get better control
over credit to the domestic economy. The Bank of Italy is reportedly
concerned about the increase in imports and believes that it is being
financed by foreign borrowing.

IV-21
Debt Situation in Selected Developing Countries
Argentina and the Philippines continue to negotiate with the IMF,
but Argentina has only begun to address its inflation problem, and the
Philippine liquidity situation remains a stumbling block. Mexico and
Brazil continue to show strong external sector performance; Brazil's
recent inflation performance has shown no improvement. Venezuela and
Mexico are both negotiating multi-year reschedulings of public sector
debt with creditor banks.
Negotiations between Argentina and the IMF on the terms of an
adjustment program that the IMF Management might approve are continuing.
On August 11, the IMF and Argentina were reported to have reached
"significant agreements" on "a series of fundamental objectives of the
Argentine program". A new IMF mission will go to Argentina shortly to
discuss a formal memorandum of understanding. However, full agreement
may still be difficult to reach. In spite of the reported progress in
Argentina's negotiations with the IMF, the banks' working committee for
Argentina refused to rollover the fully secured $125 million credit
granted at the end of June and falling due on August 15. The country's
external liquidity position appears to have eased significantly during
the first half of 1984, a period of seasonal export strength. In July,
the Central Bank lifted limitations on the availability of foreign
exchange, which should permit elimination of commercial arrears. At the
end of July, Argentina repaid from its own funds the $300 million it had
borrowed on March 30 from Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. The
January-June trade surplus was $2.8 billion, about $900 million larger
than in the same months of 1983. After lagging behind since February,

IV-22
the monthly rate of depreciation of the official exchange rate exceeded
the monthly rate of price increase by more than 2 percentage points in
July, providing a minor offset to the real appreciation of the peso over
the previous 18 months. In the first half of 1984, real GDP was 5
percent higher than a year earlier.
Brazil registered a trade surplus of more than $7 billion during
the first seven months of the year, compared with $3.6 billion over the
first seven months of 1983, due largely to strong export growth. The
current account deficit in the first half of this year was $400 million,
compared with $3.3 billion in the same period last year. Prices
increased by 10.3 percent in the month of July, not significantly dif-
ferent from the average during the first half of this year. Preliminary
information suggests that Brazil met all of its IMF performance criteria
in the second quarter, with the possibile exception of the nominal
public sector borrowing requirement. Liquid cash reserves (including
gold) have continued to grow and were reported to be $4.5 billion at the
end of July.
Mexico ran a trade surplus in January-May of $6.4 billion, $600
million more than in the same period of 1983. Imports were 35 percent
higher, but non-oil exports were 50 percent higher. The spread between
the "free" market exchange rate in Mexico and the rate in U.S. markets
has contined to narrow since early July and was less than 3 percent in
early August. The annualized rate of increase in the CPI in the first
seven months of 1984 was 66.5 percent, down from about 96 percent in the
same period of 1983. The slowing of inflation was especially notable in
the May-July, when the annualized rate was 49.4 percent. As a result,

IV-23
the effective annual yield on short-term deposits, which at 61.6 percent
has remained virtually unchanged in nominal terms since early April,
turned positive in real terms. Negotiations with bank creditors on a
multi-year rescheduling of public sector debt are continuing.
On July 25 Venezuela and its creditor banks renewed discussions on
rescheduling public sector external debt, after IMF "endorsement" of the
Venezuelan adjustment program and progress in the implementation of a
plan to reduce private sector external interest arrears. The Vene-
zuelans asked for a rescheduling of $22 billion of public sector
external debt over 15 years at LIBOR plus 7/8. Annual debt service
payments would be fixed at $4.2 billion, with the amount amortized
determined by the level of interest rates. Banks have made a counter-
proposal, offering to reschedule maturities thorugh 1985, totaling about
$16 billion, over 9 to 10 years with two years' grace at LIBOR plus
1-1/2 or prime plus 1-1/4. Banks have reportedly rejected the fixed
debt service concept. Talks are continuing.
In the Philippines, the economic situation remains serious. The
inflation rate in June (over June 1983) was 52 percent, up from the 40
percent rate recorded in May. An IMF mission spent two weeks in Manila
in July but no agreement on a stabilization program was reached. On
July 23 Banco Filipino--one of the 15 largest banks in the Philippines--
closed its doors. In order to permit the bank to reopen, the Central
Bank provided a loan of $167 million, which will make it virtually
impossible for the country to meet the liquidity-reduction targets
suggested by the IMF. Prime Minister Virata said on August 7 that
agreement on an IMF program may not be reached until as late as October.
