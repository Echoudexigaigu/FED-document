The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The pace of economic expansion slowed considerably during the third
quarter as growth slackened in a number of sectors, even prior to the six-
day auto strike in September. Industrial production rose only slightly in
August and payroll employment decelerated. Consumption spending leveled off
in July and August, housing starts dropped in both months, and growth in
business capital spending moderated. In July, further import expansion
pushed the trade deficit to a record figure. Producer prices fell in
August, but consumer prices rose a little faster than in most recent
months.
Industrial Production
Industrial production edged up an estimated 0.2 percent in August,
after climbing 0.9 percent in both June and July. For consumer goods, out-
put declined 0.4 percent in August, largely reflecting reduced assemblies
of autos and lightweight trucks. Tight supplies of quality parts limited
auto assemblies in August to an annual rate of 7.7 million units, down from
the July rate of 7.9 million units; and the strike at selected G.M. plants
contributed to a further reduction in September. Output of goods for the
home, including appliances, and production of nondurable consumer goods
also declined in August. In contrast, production of equipment for both
business and defense continued to advance strongly last month, and output
of construction supplies edged up.
With production gains moderating in August, capacity utilization in
manufacturing was unchanged, following a sizable increase in July. At
82.8 percent, the August utilization rate was slightly higher than the
1967-82 average and 14 percentage points above the postwar low registered

in late 1982. During August, substantial declines in operating rates for
steel, aluminum, and auto assemblies were offset by increases for nonelec-
trical machinery, instruments, and petroleum refining.
Employment and Unemployment
Employment growth slowed during the third quarter, and the unemplov-
ment rate in August remained at 7-1/2 percent, the same as the average for
the second quarter. Jobless rates were little changed during August for
most demographic groups.
As measured by the establishment survey, the employment gains
in July and August-averaging about 210,000 per month (strike-adjusted)--
were only two-thirds as large as the average monthly increase during the
first half of 1984. Much of the slowdown occurred in the manufacturing
sector; factory job gains totaled only 29,000 in August, with increases in
a few durable goods industries--particularly autos--partly offset by de-
clines in a number of nondurable goods industries. In addition, the fac-
tory workweek edged down again to 40.4 hours, off from the cyclical high of
41.1 hours registered in April. By contrast, employment in the trade and
services industries continued to expand at a healthy pace during August,
although below the first-half rate. The reported employment growth in
services would have been larger but for a since-settled strike of
hospital workers that removed about 50,000 persons from the payrolls.
In the household survey, monthly changes in employment have been
quite volatile in recent months, with exceptional gains early in the summer
being reversed partly by sharp declines in July and August. Almost all of
the August decline in employment took place among youths; because of a late

anticipation of returning to school.
Personal Income and Consumption
Personal income rose at a $16.1 billion annual rate in August, a gain
that was about a third below the average increase during the first half of
the year. The slowdown in income growth largely reflected the easing of
labor demand, as nonlabor income continued its strong advance.
Nominal personal consumption expenditures were nearly flat in both
July and August and, in real terms, probably declined somewhat following
large real gains in the preceding three quarters. Continued growth in
expenditures for services throughout the summer was offset by falloffs in
spending at retail outlets for a wide range of consumer goods. Outlays for
clothing and shoes dropped sharply this summer after a surge in the second
quarter; spending for furniture and appliances, which had been exceptionally
strong since the fall of 1982, also declined.
The easing of consumer spending also reflected a decline in new car
sales. Crimped by a shortage of inventories, sales of domestic units
dropped in August to a 7.6 million unit annual rate. The selling rate
rebounded in the first 20 days of September, but the strike at G.M. probably
depressed sales toward the end of the month. In July and August, sales of
imported units remained close to 2.5 million units per year.
Despite the softness in consumer spending during July and August,
the surveys from the Michigan Survey Research Center and the Conference

Board indicate that consumer confidence remained high. The Michigan index
of sentiment edged up during August to within 2 percentage points of the
20-year peak reported in March of this year. Much of the gain in August
was attributable to more favorable evaluations of present and expected
personal finances. The Conference Board index of consumer attitudes
changed little in August and was 6.2 percentage points above a year earlier.
The moderate rise in nominal disposable income, coupled with almost
no increase in personal consumption expenditures, resulted in a rise in
the personal saving rate to 6-1/2 percent in August, up 0.8 percentage
point from the second quarter.
Business Fixed Investment
Growth in capital spending by business moderated this summer, following
extremely large gains in both producers' durable equipment and nonresidential
construction earlier this year. In the equipment sector, shipments of
nondefense capital goods by domestic producers fell 0.4 percent in August,
to a level 1 percent below the second quarter average; declines in August
were concentrated in heavy industrial machinery. In contrast, purchases of
equipment from abroad continued to climb. Imports of capital goods (excluding
autos) surged 42 percent in July, when the U.S. trade balance in capital
goods was negative for the first time in the postwar era. Largely because
of the strength of the dollar, capital goods imports as a portion of domestic
equipment investment already had risen from about 12 percent in 1978 to
about 24 percent in the first half of this year.
Nominal construction expenditures rose 0.3 percent in July, after
average monthly gains of 2-1/2 percent in the first six months of the year.
Commercial construction, in particular office building, remained a source of

strength; nominal expenditures for commercial structures rose 1.5 nercent
in July and have climbed more than 30 percent since last December.
On the whole, forward-looking indicators point to further gains in
business spending in coming months. Although new orders of nondefense
capital goods fell in July and August, the backlog of unfilled orders
remained relatively high. Also, contracts and permits for new nonresidential
building increased in July, and were running well above year-earlier levels.
Finally, the Commerce Department's August survey reported that firms still
plan to increase nominal spending on plant and equipment by about 14-1/2
percent in 1984 as a whole, which would be consistent with continued growth
in capital spending in the second half.
Business Inventories
Businesses accumulated inventories at a brisk rate in July after a
temporary lull in June. In constant dollars, total manufacturing and trade
inventories rose at an annual rate of $23 billion in July, about the same
as the average pace during the first half of the year. Despite large
inventory increases since the beginning of the year, the overall inventory-
sales ratio still appears low by historical standards. However, excess
stocks in a few industries, including building materials and consumer
durables, have caused some limited cutbacks in production.
Manufacturers continued their vigorous inventory expansion in July,
as factory stocks rose at an annual rate of $11-1/2 billion in real terms
after a $13-3/4 billion rate of buildup in the second quarter. Nonetheless,
stocks in most industries remain lean in relation to sales, and manufac-
turers appear to be positioned for further inventory expansion. Since
early spring, the bulk of the increase in factory stocks has occurred in
capital goods industries.

In the trade sector, non-auto inventories generally have been rising
with some limited reports of overstocking recently. Auto stocks were drawn
down in July, but the first deliveries of 1985 models in August enabled
dealers to replenish their inventories a bit, achieving a 57-days' supply
by the end of the month.
Housing Markets
Activity in housing markets weakened during the summer, as housing
starts fell sharply in both July and August. Newly issued permits for
residential units also declined. In the multifamily sector, starts declined
in August; but, on balance, multifamily activity has remained surprisingly
robust in recent months. The strength in multifamily construction this
year apparently has continued to be concentrated in rental units; in the
second quarter only 31 percent of multifamily starts were in condominium or
cooperative structures. By contrast, such "for sale" units made up more
than 40 percent of multifamily starts as recently as early 1982.
Starts of single-family units declined for the fourth consecutive
month in August; since the first quarter, such activity has declined almost
30 percent. Home sales have fallen by lesser margins, as sales of both new
and existing properties during the summer were off only 12 percent from
their early-year peaks.
Despite some recent retrenchment, single-family markets have shown
considerable resilience, given that nominal interest rates on fixed-rate
mortgage loans have remained high by historical norms. This strength,
reflecting the continued widespread use of mortgages with initial interest
rates below those of traditional fixed-rate loans, has been apparent not
only in the number of units started, but also in the size and amenities of

houses purchased. The two-year trend toward higher quality new houses
continued through the second quarter of 1984, according to data recently
released by the Census Bureau.
Federal Government
The federal government apparently had an unusually large budget
deficit in August, but probably ran a surplus of between $15 to $20 billion
in September. For fiscal year 1984 as a whole, the federal government
deficit is apt to be in the neighborhood of $173 billion, about $20 billion
less than in fiscal year 1983.
To date, only four of the 13 fiscal 1985 appropriation bills have
been enacted. However, the chief barrier to progress--agreement on the
size and the content of future defense spending increases-has been lifted
and enactment of some the remaining appropriations bills is now expected
before the early October adjournment. In addition, Congress is considering
a continuing resolution to provide interim funding until the remaining
appropriations are decided.
One element in the controversy about future defense appropriations
has been the slower-than-anticipated growth in current outlays. Rased on
ten months of data, FY1984 national defense expenditures are likely to
total less than $230 billion, nearly $10 billion below the figures pro-
jected last February by the administration and the CBO. A similar short-
fall from anticipated spending levels occurred in fiscal 1983. A number of
explanations have been suggested for the slower spending rate, including
lower-than-expected costs and longer start-up times for new programs.
Moreover, tighter quality control by the Department of Defense is believed
to have reduced outlays for some big-ticket items. Despite the shortfalls

II-15
from budget projections, monthly defense outlays are averaging more than 8
percent above year-earlier levels, and contract and orders data suggest
such growth will continue for some time.
State and Local Government
Indicators point to continued increases in real spending by state
and local governments. Employment has trended up all year and in July and
August was at its highest level since the end of 1981. This year's payroll
increases follow a period during which 40 states imposed hiring freezes or
reduced their work forces. In July, construction outlays rose briskly,
paced by sizable increases for roads and educational facilities. As their
fiscal conditions have improved, several states have taken steps to reduce
tax rates or to allow temporary tax hikes-mandated during the recession-
to be cut back.
Exports and Imports
Imported goods continue to fill a growing share of domestic demand.
Although the monthly pattern has been erratic, merchandise imports in
real terms in the four-month period ending in July averaged 4 percent above
the first-quarter pace. This increase in imports, encompassing a wide
range of manufactured goods, reflects the strength of aggregate demand in
the United States as well as the high exchange value of the dollar. Owing
to the strength of imports, the trade deficit widened to a record level in
July despite another monthly increase in the volume of nonagricultural
exports, which in July reached their highest level since late 1981. The
July improvement in exports was concentrated in industrial supplies, busi-
ness machines, and automotive exports to Canada. (Further discussion of
international economic developments is included in Part IV.)

II-16
Prices
Incoming price data, taken together, suggest that inflation is
holding at about the pace seen earlier this year. Producer prices of
finished goods edged down 0.1 percent in August after increasing 0.3 per-
cent a month earlier. By contrast, the CPI increased 0.5 percent after
a July advance of 0.3 percent.
Among producer goods, capital equipment prices rose 0.3 percent in
August, close to the average rate for the year to date. Prices of inter-
mediate materials less food and energy were little changed in August for
the second month.
Food prices at the consumer level picked up in August, rising
0.6 percent after registering little net change over the previous five
months. The August increase stemmed from a surge in fresh vegetable
prices and from a price upturn for meats. However, it appears that the
upward pressures evident in the August index may be short lived. The
supply shortages that give rise to spurts in prices of fresh vegetables
typically are reversed within a few months. Moreover, crude food prices
fell sharply in the August PPI, and developments in commodity markets
since mid-August suggest that the crude foods index may be down again in
September.
Retail energy prices were little changed in August, as further de-
clines in prices of gasoline and fuel oil were offset by increases for
electricity and natural gas. Spot prices for both gasoline and fuel oil
have firmed since mid-August, returning to their early-summer levels.
Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices have risen at an annual
rate of about 5 percent since the end of 1982. The August increase, which

Wages and Labor Costs
Wage inflation, has remained moderate so far in the third quarter.
The hourly earnings index, which covers wages paid to production and non-
supervisory workers, fell 0.2 percent in August, as decreases in the service-
producing sectors reversed the gains posted in the preceding month. Over
the past year, this measure of wage change has risen at a 3-1/4 percent
annual rate.
Wage settlements in new collective bargaining agreements have been
consistent with the general wage temperance. Pay cuts and wage freezes in
new contracts are less evident than earlier in the year; but first-year
adjustments in new settlements, according to data collected by the
Bureau of National Affairs (a private publishing company), have averaged
3-3/4 percent since the beginning of the year, down from 4-1/2 percent in
1983 and 7 percent in 1982. More recently, tentative collective bargaining
agreements were reached in the auto and mining industries. The settlement
between the United Auto Workers and General Motors, provides for an initial
wage rate increase averaging 2-1/4 percent and lump sum payments of around
2-1/4 percent of annual earnings in the second and third years in addition
to COLAs; this would increase wage costs at G.M. roughly 20 percent over the
next three years, assuming a 5 percent rate of inflation. In addition, the
settlement provides for continued profit sharing and for a commitment by
G.M. of about $1 billion for income support and retraining of workers
affected by new technology and outsourcing. The mine workers settled for a
moderate 10-1/4 percent wage increase spread over 40 months.

II-19
For the private nonfarm sector as a whole, hourly compensation-which
includes fringe benefits and employer payroll taxes as well as wages--in-
creased at a 3.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter. As a result of
an upward revision in productivity growth to an annual rate of 4.7 percent,
unit labor costs now are estimated to have fallen 0.9 percent (annual rate)
in the second quarter. Hourly compensation rose 4 percent and unit labor
costs 1.3 percent from a year earlier.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Credit markets rallied further over the intermeeting period as
incoming information indicated a moderation of economic activity in the
third quarter and continued slow money growth. In addition, with the
federal funds rate declining since the last FOMC meeting from the 11-3/4
percent to the 11 percent area, and adjustment plus seasonal borrowing
from the discount window dropping below the $1 billion level where it had
been since April, market participants have concluded that the System is
seeking somewhat easier bank reserve conditions. Most other money market
rates were off 15 to 50 basis points by late September, with rates on
private paper down more than those on bills, implying some further
narrowing of risk premiums. Rate declines generally were somewhat
smaller at the longer end, where spreads between private and government
rates also narrowed.
The monetary aggregates grew sluggishly in August. M1 edged up
at a 1-3/4 percent annual rate, about offsetting the previous month's
decline and leaving this aggregate just below the midpoint of its
longer-run target range. M2 growth in August, at 4-1/2 percent, was
little changed from the slow July rate, and this aggregate moved
further below the midpoint of its range. Despite the slower expansion
of M1 and M2 in recent months, available evidence suggests that velocity
growth for these aggregates in the third quarter will fall short of
increases posted earlier in the year. M3 growth fell to a 4-3/4 percent
rate in August, about half its recent pace, as a change in funding
patterns at thrift institutions and some slowing of loan demands at
large banks contributed to a sharp deceleration in its large time

deposit component. M3 in August was just above the 9 percent upper
boundary of its target range. Data for early September indicate that
a pickup in growth of all measures of the money stock is in train this
month.
Private credit demands, although remaining robust, evidently
slowed in August. Reduced consumer lending at commercial banks and
weakness in retail sales suggest that consumer credit growth in August
continued the downtrend that began in June. Growth in mortgage credit
also may have moderated in August, judging from partial data and field
reports. Reduced business borrowing appears to have been entirely
accounted for by a drop in merger activity and to have been concentrated
in the short-term area, as many firms turned to the bond markets in
August. Despite the lessening in private credit demands, an acceleration
of federal debt to its fastest growth rate in half a year brought
expansion of the total domestic nonfinancial debt aggregate to nearly a
14 percent clip in August. Fragmentary evidence suggests that the debt
aggregate will slow in September, however, with growth in federal debt
falling sharply and private demands likely to moderate further.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The July weakness in M1 extended into August, although data through
early September clearly indicate some rebound. The August weakness was
again concentrated in runoffs of demand deposits, which continued to be
widespread among banks. Currency strengthened a bit last month, while
other checkable deposits resumed expanding after the unusual contrac-
tion in July. The flatness in M1 in July and August may in part have
represented an unwinding of the June surge in transactions deposits.

For the third quarter as a whole, though, available evidence points to
about a 1-1/2 percent increase in M1 velocity at an annual rate, as the
deceleration in M1 likely will fall well short of the slowing in nominal
GNP growth. Nevertheless, velocity growth in the third quarter is again
in line with the pace implied by the Board's quarterly econometric model.
M2 growth in recent months may well have been restrained by lagged
responses to the earlier rise in interest rates and by a moderate growth
in wealth. In August, a slowing of its nontransaction component offset
the pickup in M1. Within nontransaction M2, general purpose and broker/
dealer money market mutual funds, which had recorded considerable inflows
in previous months, were virtually flat in August, despite a sizable rate
advantage over MMDAs; the rally in the stock market reportedly encouraged
some money fund customers to shift into equity funds. Declines in MMDAs
continued, reaching $5-3/4 billion in August--the largest monthly drop
since their introduction--while outflows from savings accounts accelerated.
Only small time deposits, which expanded at a rate in excess of 20 percent
for the second straight month, and overnight RPs exhibited strength last
month.
The weakening of MMDAs and savings deposits and the strengthening
of small time deposits in recent months are consistent with the structure
of offering rates on deposits. As market interest rates increased on
balance over the spring, offering rates on time accounts lagged, and
spreads between market rates and offering rates widened, particularly
for deposits with maturities of a year or more. Over the past several
months, a flattening of the yield curve has brought about a considerable
narrowing of spreads between market rates and offering rates for longer-

term deposits, while the relative attractiveness of short-term deposits
has deteriorated. With the yield curve for deposit offering rates
steeply sloped at the very short end and offering rates on accounts of
a year or longer now more in line with market rates, investors have been
lengthening the maturities of their deposits.
The abrupt slowing of M3 growth in August primarily reflected a
sharp reduction in CD issuance at both commercial banks and thrifts.
Large time deposits, which had grown at rates between 25 and 40 per-
cent over the first seven months of the year, slowed to an annual rate
of 8-1/2 percent in August. Highly-publicized funding difficulties at
a West Coast savings and loan association, which had tapped the national
CD market in volume earlier in the year, contributed substantially to
the slowdown in large time deposits at thrift institutions in August and
apparent runoffs in September. The slowing in large time deposits at
commercial banks in August likely was related to much diminished loan
demands at large banks; a sizable runup in Treasury balances in Sep-
tember is restraining CDs this month. Continued runoffs of term Euro-
dollars also contributed to the weakness of M3 growth. By contrast,
term RPs increased by $3-3/4 billion last month, as large banks financed
a sizable addition of Treasury securities to their trading accounts.
Bank credit growth was unchanged in August at an 8-1/2 percent
annual rate. Increased acquisitions of Treasury and other securities
offset a deceleration in loan growth which, at 7-1/2 percent, was the
slowest in almost a year. Business loans expanded by 9 percent, down a
bit from the July rate, but only half the merger-boosted growth regis-
tered during the first half of the year. The slowdown in business lending

during July and August was concentrated at large banks, where credit
demands appear to have weakened.1 Real estate lending remained below
the first-half pace, while growth in consumer loans, which had been at
annual rates above 20 percent in each of the past three quarters,
slipped to a 14 percent rate. A large decline in volatile security
loans also contributed to weakness in loan growth last month. Data for
large banks in early September show a slight pickup in growth of their
business loans from the very slow August rate but continuing moderation
in growth of consumer and real estate loans.
Business Finance
Business loans at domestic banking offices and foreign branches of
U.S. banks plus nonfinancial commercial paper expanded at a 14 percent
annual rate in August, not much above the reduced pace of the previous
month. Short- and intermediate-term business credit demands have
expanded more slowly of late, despite a probable further widening
in the gap between capital spending and internal sources of funds at
nonfinancial corporations. Financing needed for large mergers has
dropped off, while long-term financing picked up in August as condi-
tions in bond and equity markets improved. Overall credit demands by
businesses adjusted for merger effects appear to have risen in August.
This pace seems likely to have been maintained in September as slightly
stronger demand for business loans at large banks this month appear to
have coincided with some slackening in commercial paper issuance and
little change in bond offerings.
1. Recent developments in business lending at large banks are discussed
in the appendix.

III-10
Nonfinancial firms issued nearly $5 billion of new bonds in
domestic and foreign markets in August. Although firms continued to
issue large volumes of variable rate and extendible notes last month,
the average maturity of bond issues, which had been declining through-
out the year, lengthened because of a step-up in issuance of 20-, 25-,
and 30-year bonds. Most of the 20- and 25-year issues are convertible
to common stock; the resurgence of these issues, a high proportion of
which represents offerings by lower-rated firms, has accompanied
generally high stock prices.
New offerings by U.S. firms in Euromarkets have been especially
strong since the last FOMC meeting, following the promulgation of new
Treasury rules for bearer bonds. So far, however, the repeal of the
withholding tax has led few new firms to use Eurobond and other foreign
bond markets, and the recent volume has been bolstered by issues that
had been postponed owing to uncertainty about the new Treasury rules.1
The broad stock market indexes reached six-month highs during
the intermeeting period, but subsequent declines have about reversed
those gains. While new stock offerings have exceeded the anemic July
volume, issuance in August and September rose only to around the average
monthly rate of the first half of the year.
The current climate for initial public offerings (IPOs) is much
poorer than last year as prices of over-the-counter stocks are still
down considerably from their 1983 highs. A substantial number of IPOs
continue to come to market, however. This year, the monthly rate has
averaged 52 first offerings, down from last year, but much greater than
1. Investors remain nervous that the Treasury may reimpose a withholding
tax or tighten disclosure requirements on foreign bond holders.

III-11
in earlier years. The almost complete absence of S&L issues since
February is a major change from the prior year, reducing both the number
of issuers and the average size of new issues.
Government Finance
Federal sector. The staff currently is expecting a combined
deficit for the third quarter of about $37 billion, bringing the total
for fiscal 1984 to around $185 billion. In addition, the Treasury is
expected to let its cash balance rise over the quarter by $17 billion,
which would leave its end-of-quarter level at more than $30 billion.
Altogether, the Treasury will have borrowed about $54 billion, net,
from the public during the third quarter. As in recent quarters, the
Treasury is raising most of its new money, about $38 billion, in auctions
of marketable coupon issues. Net bill financing accounts for the remain-
ing $13 billion raised in marketable form.
As of late September, Treasury debt outstanding subject to the
statutory limit was only $5 billion under its ceiling. According to
staff estimates, this ceiling will be reached in late September or early
October when the Treasury credits civilian and military pension funds.
The Treasury has decided to postpone its usual end-of-quarter auctions,
originally scheduled for late this month, out of concern that Congress
may fail to lift the debt limit by then. When these auctions are held
later in October, they may include one or two new instruments. In
conjunction with its regular domestic 4-year note auction, the Treasury
plans to auction simultaneously between $1 and $2 billion of 4-year notes
targeted to foreign buyers. In contrast to the semiannual coupon that
has been the standard domestically, the security for foreign sales will

have an annual coupon, the practice in Euromarkets. Tenders for these
new securities must include the identity of the registered owner, but
need only to certify that the beneficial owner is neither a U.S. citizen
nor a U.S. resident. Another financing innovation may be the offering
of only five years of call protection on the 20-year bond regularly
included in the end-of-quarter financing. Previous 20-year bonds have
not been callable.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies has swelled
in the third quarter, owing primarily to heavy financing needs of the
Federal Home Loan Banks. Advances by FHLBs to thrifts rose appreciably
in August, largely reflecting the funding needs of a large West Coast
S&L. In July, demands for advances by thrifts generally had eased as
acquisitions of mortgage assets slowed. FNMA also has stepped up its
borrowing in the third quarter.
Several agencies have been taking advantage of the large investor
appetite for zero-coupon bonds. FNMA issued $6-3/4 billion of 35-year
zero-coupon subordinated debentures early in September in order to raise
$200 million; the issue, reportedly the first of its kind, yielded 10.08
percent. SLMA subsequently offered $5 billion of 38-year zero-coupon
debentures at a yield of 9.70 percent, raising $125 million of new cash.
State and local sector. Strong activity in the long-term tax-
exempt market has reflected the surge in issuance of private-purpose
bonds that began in late June following legislative clarification. In
July and August, seasonally adjusted monthly gross offerings of long-
term debt averaged about $8 billion, compared with the $5-3/4 billion
average monthly pace over the first half of the year. Single-family

mortgage revenue bonds accounted for about 40 percent of the volume in
the most recent two months, as state and municipal housing authorities in
all parts of the country responded to declining bond yields. Issuance
of industrial development bonds similarly was strong in August, totaling
$1.5 billion or more. In the short-term market, the volume of tax-exempt
offerings has slackened a bit in recent months as HUD was forced to
cancel planned sales of project notes pending clarification of certain
financing restrictions set forth in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984.
With issuance rising, tax-exempt rates have not declined with
other long-term rates, and the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields
has increased from levels earlier in the summer.
Mortgage Markets
Growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding has slackened
in recent months, constrained by higher costs of credit. During August,
debt expansion remained below the May high, judging from a continued
reduced rate of net lending by commercial banks and a decrease in the
volume of new issues of federally guaranteed mortgage pass-through
securities (after adjustment for swaps). In July, expansion of the
mortgage component of the domestic nonfinancial debt aggregate had
already moderated a bit further to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of around 10 percent, compared with nearly 11 percent in June and
13-1/2 percent in May.
Commitment data also indicate a slowing in mortgage activity.
S&Ls issued new commitments in July at a seasonally adjusted monthly
rate of about $18-1/2 billion, somewhat above the upward-revised June
volume but below the May peak. At federally insured associations,

mortgage commitments outstanding rose only $70 million in July, the
smallest monthly increase in two years. Although mortgage lending by
S&Ls dropped less than in June, their net acquisitions of mortgage
assets were off substantially in July as net takings of mortgage-backed
securities fell sharply.
In early August, major institutional originators of conventional
home loans were continuing to shift toward offering adjustable-rate
mortgages (ARMs) with "caps" on lifetime rate increases, and away from
ARMs lacking this kind of consumer protective feature (upper panel of
chart on page 111-18). As a share of the market, ARMs of all types
again accounted for the bulk of lending on conventional home mortgages
early last month, representing on average 68 percent of the total
number of such loans closed. However, the initial rate advantage of
ARMs over fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) declined in early August (lower
panel of chart), apparently due to a flattening of the yield curve
during the latest months depicted in the chart.1 FHA's new program for
ARMs, launched at the end of July, has continued to work its way gradu-
ally into the primary market, despite the narrow scope of the secondary
market that has developed so far for this special product. Initial
offering rates generally have been about 100 basis points below rates
on FHA-insured FRMs.
Most interest rates on home mortgage loans have drifted down 10
1. Initial costs of credit on uncapped ARMs have been running above con-
tract interest rates on capped ARMS, as shown by the charted FHLBB series.
This anomalous behavior probably reflects tradeoffs in other loan charac-
teristics, such as the possibility that uncapped mortgages may feature
longer time periods between adjustments in interest rates or in mortgage
payments.

to 30 basis points further since the August FOMC meeting, but are still
around 100 basis points or more above their lows of early this year.
On FRMs in the primary market, contract rates on new commitments at
S&Ls for conventional home mortgages--which typically lag secondary
market yields--dipped around 10 basis points, averaging 14.29 percent on
September 21. At a sample of large mortgage companies reporting to HUD,
effective rates on conventional FRMs dropped more than 25 basis points.
Yields on both ARMs and FRMs in the more sensitive secondary market also
were lower by late September. On VA-guaranteed home loans, minimal
discounts have evoked some market expectations of a cut in the current
ceiling rate of 13-1/2 percent.
Consumer Credit
In light of the deceleration in consumer loans at commercial banks
and the weakness in retail sales in August, growth in consumer install-
ment credit apparently slowed further last month. To some extent,
recent signs of slowing in consumer expenditures have been magnified by
shortages of popular models of new cars. However, other components of
retail sales that are typically financed by credit also were off in
August.
The 19-3/4 percent annual rate of increase in installment credit
outstanding in July, while down considerably from the unusually strong 30
percent pace in May, was still quite substantial by historical standards.
Almost half the July gain was in automobile credit; revolving credit, which
had risen strongly over the preceding six months, was off appreciably as
retail sales weakened at department, furniture, and apparel stores.

commercial banks on balance somewhat increased their willingness to
lend to consumers in the three months ending in August. Consumer
lending rates at banks moved higher between early May and early August,
with new-car loan rates up by 55 basis points and personal loan rates
up by 40 basis points. The average rate on bank credit card plans also
increased. Finance companies raised their rates on new-car loans in
August by 33 basis points to 15.01 percent--the highest rate in almost
two years, but nearly 300 basis points below the August 1982 peak.
The increases in auto loan rates moved spreads over market yields
toward a more typical range from the narrow differentials of earlier
this year. The average maturity of new-car loans at finance companies
lengthened further in August to 49.2 months, more than three months
longer than a year earlier.
Even though consumer credit has surged in 1984, there is little
evidence that credit quality has eroded significantly. The average
delinquency rate on closed-end installment loans at commercial banks
rose rather sharply during the second quarter, but was still historical-
ly low; the first-quarter figure was the lowest in 12 years. Auto loan
delinquencies at finance companies remained at a near-record low. More-
over, personal bankruptcy filings dropped 6 percent in the second quarter
and, for the first time since early 1980, were below the 70,000 case
level.

APPENDIX A*
RECENT BUSINESS LOAN DEVELOPMENTS AT LARGE BANKS
Business loan growth at large weekly reporting banks slowed
considerably over the three months ending in August. At small banks, by
contrast, C&I loans accelerated slightly over this period. Information
available from both the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
on Bank Lending Practices (LPS) and the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending
(STBL) suggests that the slowdown in business lending at large banks
reflects reduced loan demand rather than a decreased willingness to make
such loans.
As shown in Table 1, almost half of the LPS respondents at very
large banks (those with assets exceeding $5 billion) reported a slowing
in C&I loan growth over the past three months; at other banks, this
share was about a third. Of the total of 25 banks reporting slower
growth, almost 90 percent attributed it primarily to weaker loan demand.
Only three respondents indicated that their loan growth slowed because
they had become less willing to lend. Five other banks (all but one over
$5 billion in assets) cited loan sales or the participating out of loans
as the reason.
According to respondents, reduced loan demand over the last three
months reflected several factors. Reduced merger activity, greater use
of alternative funding sources, improved internal cash flow, and slower
inventory accumulation were factors cited by about half of the respon-
dents. A reduction in the pace of capital spending was cited less
frequently. With regard to merger financing in August, respondents
estimated that, on average, about 8-1/2 percent of their gross C&I
loan extensions were made to finance mergers, acquisitions or lever-
aged buy-outs, down from nearly 19 percent during the first quarter
of 1984.1
Data from the August STBL supports the LPS findings that banks
on balance have not attempted to deflect demands for business credit
to other lenders by raising the markup over their cost of funds.
Indeed, spreads on money market priced business loans were narrower
in August than in previous surveys. Informal interviews that Board
staff conducted recently with corporate lending officers at several
* Prepared by Thomas F. Brady and Patrick Parkinson, Economists, Banking
Section, Division of Research and Statistics.
1. Both of these averages are weighted by respondent's C&I loan out-
standing. This decline appears consistent with other reports that
merger-related credit demands have abated but inconsistent with replies
to LPS question, 3b, to which more respondents reported that merger-
related loan demand has trended up over the past six months than reported
it had declined. However, without being able to quantify how much
merger-related lending rose or fell at banks responding to question 3b,
no quantitative comparison can be made.

large banks revealed that money market priced loans are made under two
types of facilities, referred to by banks as "lines" and "commitments",
respectively. Lines are relatively informal arrangements under which
banks agree that on demand they will quote the firm a loan rate on a
fixed-rate loan for a specific maturity (usually under a year) and an
amount selected by the borrower, within specified limits. Banks
generally set the price of such loans as a spread over a reference
market rate for the same maturity as the requested loan, for example,
the 30-day CD rate for a 30-day loan.1 The borrower, however, simply
receives an all-in rate on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Because banks
retain full flexibility with respect to pricing under such arrangements,
they can widen or narrow their markup spreads to reduce or augment the
quantity of these loans outstanding. According to market sources,
virtually all large loans having maturities of under a month are made
under such lines and are priced off market rates. As shown in Table 2,
the STBL data reveal that, for large loans ($1 million and above) with
maturities of a month and under, the average markup over the funding
cost (taken as the federal funds rate) was lower in August than it has
been in over a year, suggesting that banks may have been attempting to
recoup some of the business being lost at that time to other markets.
Unlike lines, loan commitments always require fees which are paid
on the amount of unused credit available under the arrangement. Commit-
ments oblige banks to lend up to agreed upon amounts as long as borrowers
meet the loan covenants included in the contract. Also in contrast to
line arrangements, loans taken down under commitments are made at pre-
established spreads over reference market rates. From a borrower's
point of view, revolving credit arrangements are attractive because they
provide some certainty about the pricing of future credit needs and
guarantee the prompt availability of funds up to a stipulated amount.
From the point of view of a bank, however, a commitment tends to reduce
liquidity, since it obligates the bank to stand ready over an extended
period to provide credit at rates fixed in relation to market rates
when the bank's own future costs of funds relative to market rates, as
well as its future ability to expand assets given equity constraints,
are uncertain. The term of revolving loan commitments typically is for
several years.
Loans available under revolvers have a number of pricing formulas.
Typically, however, they provide for two basic options: funds can be
drawn down at a rate tied to the bank's prime rate with no set maturity,
or priced at the rates linked to a money market rate such as LIBOR or CD
rates.2 The latter type of loan has a fixed maturity selected by the
borrower with a rate that reflects the maturity. Most loans that are
priced in relation to money market rates have maturities of between a
month and a year, frequently 30, 90 or 180 days. The bottom line of
1. Funding decisions are quite separate from lending decisions, however,
and individual loans may or may not be matched-funded.
2. Some banks book loans priced off LIBOR at their foreign branches.
Such loans are not included in the STBL data.

III-A-3
Table 2 shows that in August loans with a maturity of between a month
and a year were made at an average spread over the cost of funding them
(taken as the 90-day CD rate) that was low in comparison with earlier
STBL surveys. These loans would include almost all domestically booked
loans made under the money market options of revolving loan agreements
as well as loans taken down under lines at these maturities. In sum,
the STBL data for August suggest that banks responded to reduced loan
demands by making price concessions where they had the flexibility to
do so.
In addition to investigating recent growth of C&I loans, the LPS
survey asked several questions about the reselling of C&I loans in
secondary markets--a practice that press reports suggest has expanded
in recent months. As noted above, loan sales do not appear to be an
important explanation for the recent weakening of loan growth at large
banks. Nevertheless, 54 percent of LPS respondents with assets over $5
billion and 36 percent of banks with assets between $1 and $5 billion
had sold C&I loans out of their portfolios during the past three months.
About 60 percent of respondents reported that loans were sold primarily
to small or medium-sized domestic banks, while 40 percent indicated
that other large domestic banks were also important buyers. Another 40
percent sold loans to their own or their holding company's subsidiaries
while only 20 percent (all over $5 billion) sold them to foreign banks.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average dollar rose seven percent between the last
FOMC meeting and September 20. (See chart) The dollar's surge took
place against a background of declining short-term U.S.-foreign interest
rate differentials. The increased likelihood that the present
Administration, which is seen as favorable toward business, would
continue in office following the November election, probably had some
upward impact on the dollar. But the magnitude of the dollar's rise
is not obviously explainable in terms of movements in fundamental
variables.
During the later part of the period the dollar seemed to be on a
speculative path, where the exchange rate increased more than the growth
in the currency's intrinsic value solely because market participants
believed that the exchange rate would continue to rise. On Friday,
September 21, the weighted-average dollar index rose two percent in the
early morning to a record high of 150.6 (not shown on the chart), but
then declined on news of a higher-than-expected CPI figure. The
Bundesbank responded with very large and publicly announced dollar sales.
This unanticipated government intervention provoked a dramatic slide in
the dollar's value. The weighted-average index value declined four per-
cent by Monday morning. During the remainder of the period the dollar edged
upward .Over the
period since the last FOMC meeting the dollar has risen about 5-3/4 percent.
On a bilateral basis the mark and pound depreciated by about 7 and
6-1/2 percent, respectively, against the dollar, while the yen and

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Recorded net capital inflows for the first seven months of 1984
reveal only part of the financial counterpart of the U.S. current account
deficit. (See the Summary Table on U.S. International Transactions.)
While there were substantial net inflows to banks in the first quarter
they were followed by a small net outflow over the next four months.
Foreign official institutions have reduced their holdings of assets in
the United States by several billion dollars thus far in 1984. On the
other hand, private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities of
over $10 billion through July are greater than for any previous year.
Net foreign direct investment has also shown a sizeable inflow, partly
reflecting a substantial inflow of funds raised in the Eurobond markets
through the Netherlands Antilles finance affiliates of U.S. companies in
the second quarter, and in part as a result of the attempted buy out of a
partially owned petroleum company by its foreign parent.
The positive statistical discrepancy in the published U.S.
International Transactions accounts totals nearly $20 billion for the
first half of the year, although the total for the first quarter was
recently revised downward substantially as a result of newly available
data revealing a sharp increase in the net financial liabilities of U.S.
nonbank residents to unaffiliated foreigners in the first quarter, a
large portion of which was related to merger financing. (Data on nonbank
claims and liabilities to foreigners for the second quarter will be
released in December and could result in a substantial revision in the
statistical discrepancy for the second quarter as well.)

IV-6
Inflows from abroad to U.S. nonbank residents also highlight the
growing importance of foreign-based banks to developments in U.S.
financial markets. A rough idea of the magnitude of the increase in
foreign banks' loans to U.S. nonbanks booked offshore can be deduced from
the fact that while the financial liabilities of U.S. nonbank residents
reported in the balance of payments data increased by $3.7 billion in the
first quarter, credit extended to U.S. nonbanks by the offshore branches
of U.S. banks increased by only $2 billion over the same period, when
calculated on a month-end basis from Federal Reserve data.
Further evidence of the increasing presence of foreign banks in the
U.S. credit markets can be seen in the commercial paper data, where the
share of foreign banks' paper in total bank related paper outstanding has
increased steadily from 9 percent in June of 1981 to 28 percent in August
of 1984. These sales of commercial paper can be used to finance some of
the offshore lending activity of foreign banks to U.S. nonbanks as well
as to foreigners.
The role of foreign banks in the U.S. market may be further
increased in the near term by other recent developments. The
Eurocurrency reserve requirement has begun to bind at an increasing
number of U.S. chartered banks, particularly large banks, thereby
increasing the marginal cost to those U.S. banks of obtaining funds in
the Euromarket and dampening their incentives to extend credit to U.S.
nonbank residents. In addition, in the aftermath of the Continental
Illinois crisis there was some evidence in the Euromarket of a narrowing
of rate spreads between the liabilities of foreign banks and those of
some U.S. banks.

IV-7
In August, U.S. chartered banks appeared to continue to reduce their
reliance on the commercial paper market as a source of funds. Bank
holding companies simultaneously reduced their commercial paper
outstanding and drew down deposits at their affiliated offices offshore.
The reduction in the Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbank residents (line
5 of the International Banking Data table) is in part attributable to the
reduced deposits offshore by U.S. bank holding companies. In order to
offset this outflow of funds, the foreign offices of U.S. chartered banks
continued to receive inflows from their head offices [line 3a]. This
shift in the pattern of funding may reflect the response of the banks'
head offices to a shift in investor preferences. Uncertainty surrounding
the extent of government guarantees may have altered investor perceptions
of the risk of holding liabilities of bank holding companies relative to
the risk of holding the liabilities of the bank itself.
The net impact on foreign purchases of U.S. securities of the repeal
of the 30 percent withholding tax on foreigners (passed by Congress at
the end of June) does not appear to have been large to date. Private net
foreign purchases of U.S. corporate and Treasury securities were
substantial in July, but they were not out of line with recent months.
However, a larger impact may become apparent in the data for the period
following the clarification of withholding tax regulations by the U.S.
Treasury, which took place in late August and early September. In the
first part of September, there were large issues of Eurobonds through the
domestic offices of U.S. corporations rather than through finance
affiliates in the Netherlands Antilles.

Foreign official institutions slightly increased their asset
holdings in the United States in July. OPEC members increased their
aggregate holdings by $1.8 billion, but this development may prove to
have been only temporary: partial information for August and early
September indicates that OPEC dollar holdings at the New York Federal
Reserve Bank were drawn down again. G-10 countries' official holdings in
the United States fell in July,

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In July, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was a record high. A
strong increase in exports was overwhelmed by a surge in imports.
The rise in imports in July, from levels recorded in June, was
spread across a wide range of manufactured goods -- particularly office
machines and parts, semiconductors, clothing, footwear, passenger cars
from Japan, automotive parts from Canada, steel and chemicals. Imports
of agricultural commodities and petroleum also rose. In the April-July
period, imports of nonoil items reached a 6 percent higher rate than in
the already strong first quarter, with increases in most major commodity
categories. The high exchange value of the dollar enhanced the price
competitiveness of imports and domestic demand remained strong. By area,
more than three-fourths of the rise in nonoil imports (April-July/Q1) was
from industrial countries, especially Japan.

Oil imports in July increased to just over 6 million barrels per day
(mbd). For the April-July period, imports averaged 5.85 mbd, 8.3 percent
higher than in the first quarter, as consumption and stock building
strengthened (on a seasonally-adjusted basis). The average price of oil
imports increased slightly in July, returning to the average for the
second quarter. Spot market prices increased in August and September but
remained well below official OPEC prices.

Exports in July reached the highest level recorded in several years.
The July increase in exports largely comprised manufactured goods. Since
the first quarter, nonagricultural exports have increased steadily,
especially exports of industrial supplies (chemicals, fuels, metals) and
business machines (computers and parts).
While agricultural exports in July were higher than the low June
figure, shipments were still substantially below the rate recorded in the
first quarter. During the summer months the Soviet Union purchased a
relatively large quantity of grain from the United States after
experiencing a very poor corn harvest. From July through mid-September
they contracted for 12 million metric tons of corn and wheat, most of
which is expected to be exported by March 1985. For the 12 months ending
in June 1984, Soviet grain purchases totalled 10.7 million metric tons.
On Friday, September 28, merchandise trade data for August will be
released by the Commerce Department.

IV-12
U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit in the second quarter was $98
billion at an annual rate, only $5 billion smaller than the trade
deficit. See the table below.
The current account deficit was nearly $20 billion (annual rate)
larger than in the first quarter. Half of the change was accounted for by
a swing to a large capital loss in net direct investment income receipts
(line 7 in the table below); most of the capital loss related to the
effect of the appreciation of the dollar on the valuation of the
foreign-currency denominated claims and liabilities of U.S. direct
investors abroad. There was also a decline in the dollar value of
operating earnings on direct investments abroad, especially in Europe
(line 8). The reduction in "other services" (line 11) largely resulted
from a strong increase in U.S. expenditures on travel and passenger fares
abroad.

Foreign Economic Developments. Of the major foreign industrial
countries, only Japan is enjoying a robust recovery, with real GNP growth
in each of the first two quarters being the highest since the 1970s. In
Canada, real GNP grew at a 2.4 percent annual rate for the first half of
1984, suggesting a continued but moderated rate of economic expansion.
Italian GDP also rose in the first half, growing at a 3 percent annual
rate. As a result of strikes, first quarter gains in GNP growth were
reversed in the second quarter in both Germany and the United Kingdom.
German industrial production recovered to above (relatively low) pre-
strike levels following the resolution of the metalworkers' strike in
July. The British coal miners' strike, however, is unresolved. Economic
activity in France remains weak. Although economic recovery is weakest
in Europe, recent budget announcements by French, German, and Italian
authorities suggest a continuation of fiscal restraint.
Inflation rates remain low or have continued to decline in the
major industrial countries. In August, the year-over-year rise in German
consumer prices fell to under 2 percent.
The Japanese trade balance surplus was $42 billion (s.a.a.r.) for
the seven months through July. Much of the rise in Japan's trade surplus
can be traced to the growth in its bilateral surplus with the United
States. The external positions of Italy, Germany, and the United
Kingdom have deteriorated relative to last year.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, real GNP in the second quarter
advanced by 6.7 percent (s.a.a.r.), somewhat below the upward revised
rate in the previous quarter of 7.6 percent. Private consumption rose by
only 1.2 percent (s.a.a.r.). Private plant and equipment investment

continued to be strong (10.4 percent growth). Net exports contributed
almost half of the growth of GNP. Other indicators point to a continued
healthy expansion: in July, industrial production rose 0.3 percent
(s.a.) to a level 12.8 percent above that of a year earlier, while retail
sales, housing starts, and new construction orders (all s.a.) advanced
strongly.
Inflation in recent months has remained low. Wholesale prices were
flat in August and essentially unchanged from the year-earlier level.
Consumer prices rose moderately in July to a level 2-1/2 percent above
that of July 1983.
In the first seven months of this year the current account recorded
a surplus of $32.5 billion (s.a.a.r.), while the trade surplus was $42
billion. The increase in the trade surplus over last year's is largely
accounted for by the change in bilateral Japan-U.S. trade: the Japanese
surplus vis-a-vis the United States rose from $18 billion in 1983 to more
than $30 billion (a.r.) in the first seven months of this year.
Although preliminary budget requests by Japanese ministries for
FY 1985 (beginning April 1, 1985) were only up by less than 1 percent
from the FY 1984 budget, total general account expenditures (including
debt servicing and transfers to local governments) increased by 8.2
percent. The Nakasone government hopes to reduce this increase and also
to hold expenditures for the Fiscal Loan and Investment Program to their
present level of $86 billion, instead of the 5 percent increase
requested. In a movement towards the liberalization of money markets,
banks have reached agreement on the outlines of short-term money market
certificates (MMCs) bearing market determined rates of interest;

IV-18
observers believe that the government will permit the banks to begin
offering MMCs as early as January.
German real GNP fell 1-1/2 percent (seasonally and calendar
adjusted) in the second quarter from the first quarter. The principal
cause of this decline was the strike of the metalworkers and printers,
which idled up to half a million workers for up to seven weeks, ending in
early July. Industrial production, however, rebounded in July to a level
above the pre-strike mark but no higher than that seen early this year.
On average, production levels during the first seven months of this year
exceeded year-earlier levels by about 3 percent. Leading indicators are
mixed, with order data suggesting particular weakness in the construction
industry. The rate of unemployment remains high in August at 9.3 percent
(s.a.), essentially unchanged from the average over the last 20 months.
Consumer prices declined in both July and August, bringing the August
year-on-year rate to 1.7 percent.
The current account (n.s.a.) was in small deficit in August,
leaving the cumulative result in near balance so far this year. Last
year's comparable surplus was $0.6 billion. The decline in the current
account surplus is primarily accounted for by a decline in the trade
surplus.
On September 13 the Finance Minister presented his 1985 budget to
the Bundestag. Government spending will increase by 2.4 percent over its
projected 1984 level, which in turn is likely to be about 1 percent lower
than planned. The federal budget deficit, now expected to be just below
DM 30 billion (1.5 percent of GNP) in 1984, is projected to decline
further to DM 24 billion in 1985.

In Canada, the economic expansion continued at a reduced pace from
that experienced in 1983. Real GNP grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent
(s.a.) in the first half of 1984, down from the 7.1 percent (Q4/Q4)
growth in 1983. Capital formation remains well below historical norms
for this stage in the recovery. Real non-residential investment grew at
an annual rate of less than 1 percent over the first half of 1984 after
falling 9 percent over 1983. The unemployment rate rose slightly in
August to 11.2 percent after falling in June and July; nevertheless, it
remains unchanged from the rate recorded in January.
Inflation fell slightly over the first half of 1984, from a rate of
5.1 percent in the first quarter of 1984 over the first quarter last year
to a rate of 4.6 percent in the second quarter over the same period last
year. The rapid U.S. recovery continues to stimulate Canadian exports.
The cumulative trade surplus (s.a.) through July stood at $9.3 billion,
almost $0.5 billion ahead of the comparable total in 1983. However,
continued growth in the service account deficit restrained the current
account. For the first half of 1984 the cumulative surplus in the
current account (s.a.) stood at about $0.5 billion compared with $1.5
billion over the year-earlier period.
Brian Mulroney and the Progressive Conservative Party swept to a
decisive victory in Canada's parlimentary elections on September 4,
capturing 211 of the 282 House of Commons seats. The Tories have yet to
detail specific policy changes though they campaigned on the general
themes of improved relations with the United States, a more favorable
climate for foreign investment and business generally, and a
restructuring of the national energy policy.

Economic activity in France has remained weak in recent months
while inflation has continued to ease. Industrial production declined by
1.5 percent (s.a.) in June and was only 1.5 percent above its year-
earlier level. The unemployment rate rose an additional 0.1 percentage
point in August to 10.1 percent (s.a.). The 0.5 percent increase in
consumer prices in August led to a further easing in the year-over-year
consumer price inflation rate to 7.5 percent. The government has
abandoned its earlier goal of reducing inflation to 5 percent by year-end
and is now forecasting a 6.7 percent inflation rate by the end of 1984.
The trade balance moved into surplus by $310 million (s.a.) in August.
On September 12 the cabinet approved the government's 1985 budget.
In line with previous announcements, a policy of relative macroeconomic
austerity will be retained. The goal will be to reduce slightly the size
of the budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP. Expenditure growth is to be
held to 6 percent (about in line with expected inflation.) Direct taxes
are to be reduced by an amount equivalent to 1 percent of GDP, including
an across-the-board 5 percent reduction in income taxes. About one-third
of these direct tax reductions will be offset by higher gasoline taxes
and other increases in government levies.
Real GNP in the United Kingdom fell 3.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
second quarter, reversing its first-quarter gain. Industrial production
fell 0.7 percent (s.a.) in July, the sixth decline in the past seven
months. This weakness is in part the result of the coal miners' strike
which has been going on since mid-March. Although the production of coal
has been substantially reduced, the effect of this strike on other
industries has been limited. The dockworkers' union called for a

IV-21
national dock strike on August 24 in support of the miners but enough
docks remained open to prevent a serious economic impact and agreement to
end that strike was reached on September 18. Negotiations between the
miners' union and the National Coal Board have recently collapsed again.
Retail prices rose 0.9 percent in August to a level 5 percent above
that of a year earlier, a rate of inflation that has been unchanged since
the start of the year. Much of the August increase in retail prices was
the result of the 2-1/4 percent rise in mortgage rates in early July.
The U.K. trade and current accounts were both in deficit in August.
The trade deficit widened to $2.7 billion for the first eight months in
1984, from $0.9 billion for the comparable period in 1983. The current
account surplus for the first eight months in 1984 was only $0.3 billion,
down $2.6 billion from the comparable period in 1983.
The Bank of England lowered its shortest-term intervention rate
from 12 to 10-1/2 percent in four steps between August 8 and August 17.
The Bank of England had increased its short-term intervention rates by
nearly 3 percent in early July in response to exchange market pressures.
On September 4, the Bank of Italy authorities raised its discount
rate to 16.5 percent from 15.5 percent. This move reversed a steady
decline in the rate, which had been lowered twice during the first half
of 1984. According to some observers, the Italian Treasury and the Bank
of Italy want to impress upon Parliament the importance of reducing the
public sector's deficit. Governor Ciampi has stated on several occasions
that Italy's huge public sector deficit left no room for further cuts in
the official bank rate. Recently, Treasury officials stated that credit
is expanding too rapidly to be consistent with a continued reduction in

IV-22
inflation. On September 14 the government issued a draft budget for
calendar 1985 showing a 4.2 percent nominal increase in the public
sector's borrowing requirement.
Real GDP in Italy grew at a 3 percent annual rate for the first
half of 1984. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index has
remained encouragingly low; the rate for the year ending in July was 10.5
percent, the lowest level in more than a decade.
Italy's current account showed a noticeable deterioration in the
first quarter of 1984. The trade balance deficit for the first half of
1984 was $3.3 billion, compared with a deficit of $2.2 billion for the
first half of 1983.

Debt Situation in Selected Developing Countries
Argentina has reached an agreement with the IMF, but the country
faces mounting financing requirements. Brazil's external situation
continues to improve, but inflation remains high. Mexico and its bank
creditors have agreed on a multi-year restructuring of public sector
debt; inflation in Mexico continues to slow, and economic activity
appears to have picked up in the third quarter. Venezuela has completed
negotiations with its bank creditors on a multi-year debt rescheduling.
Peru's fiscal and external payments situation has deteriorated sharply.
The Philippines has submitted a letter of intent to the IMF, and if the
necessary financing is available the program could go to the IMF Board
for approval in November.
Argentina and the IMF reached agreement on the terms of an adjust-
ment program on Sepember 25. It is uncertain when the program will go
to the IMF Executive Board for approval because the Managing Director
needs assurance that the necessary financing will be available, and the
external financing requirements are large. Meanwhile, Argentina faces a
shortage of liquidity immediately available to pay overdue interest on
its public sector debt to banks. (About $900 million would be needed to
eliminate all interest arrears through the end of September.) Argentina
was scheduled to pay on September 15 the $750 million balance of the
bridge loan that it obtained in December 1982, but this oft-postponed
payment was not made (although interest on this loan is being paid).
The banks rejected an Argentine request for a simple 90-day extension
and the payment is now being rolled over on a day-to-day basis.
Although Argentina has eliminated arrears on private sector import

IV-24
payments, total arrears have increased this year. At the end of August,
they were about $800 million higher than at the end of 1983. Inflation
remains a serious problem; in August the CPI was 650 percent higher than
a year earlier.
Brazil registered a trade surplus of more than $8 billion during
the first eight months of the year, compared with $4.3 billion over the
first eight months of 1983, due largely to strong export growth. The
current account deficit for the year is now expected to be $2.7 billion,
substantially below the IMF projection of $5.3 billion. Prices
increased by 10.6 percent in the month of August, a slight increase over
the monthly rate recorded in July, but not significantly different from
the average during the first seven months of the year. New regulations
were recently passed to allow the Central Bank to achieve the revised
growth target for the monetary base of 95 percent on an end-December to
end-December basis. Negotiations with creditor banks are expected to
begin in late October or early November. It is expected that the
Brazilians will try to obtain a multi-year rescheduling of debt coming
due between 1985 and 1990 in addition to $1 billion to $2 billion in new
credits.
Mexico and its Bank Advisory Committee have agreed to restructure
$48.7 billion of public sector debt to banks maturing in 1985-90 over 14
years, with a spread averaging 1-1/8 percent over LIBOR (or over a
secondary market reserve-adjusted CD rate) and no rescheduling fee.
Mexico is to make a prepayment of $1.0-$1.5 billion this year on the $5
billion "new money" loan of 1983 and the balance of this loan will be
repaid on the schedule that applies to the 1984 "new money" loan, which

IV-25
is not being restructured. The agreement includes a formula whereby the
IMF will monitor Mexican policies and performance during the period of
the rescheduling in the form of enhanced Article IV consultations each
year with mid-year reviews. Mexico's trade surplus in January-June was
$7.3 billion, $500 million more than in the same period last year. The
spread between the "free" market exchange rate in Mexico and the rate in
U.S. markets has continued to narrow and was only about 0.5 percent on
September 25. The annualized rate of increase in the CPI in the first
eight months of 1984 was 63 percent, down from 91 percent in the same
period of 1983. In June-August the annualized rate was 46.5 percent.
As a result, the effective annual yield on short-term time deposits,
which had remained virtually unchanged in nominal terms at 61.6 percent
since early April, turned positive in real terms. Since mid-August, the
nominal rates have been gradually reduced. There are some indications
that economic activity may have begun to pick up slightly in the third
quarter.
In late August, Venezuela and its creditor banks reconvened the
negotiations on a multi-year rescheduling of Venezuela's public sector
debt and reached agreement on September 21 on essentially the same terms
as were agreed with Mexico-a spread of 1-1/8 over LIBOR and a maturity
of 12-1/2 years. Final agreement is contingent on the Venezuelan
government making significant progress in reducing private sector
interest arrears, which total about $1 billion.
The fiscal and external payments situation of Peru has deteri-
orated sharply over the past two months. Government expenditures are
far exceeding receipts, and external arrears of about $200 million on

IV-26
public sector debt have accumulated. About half of this amount is
interest payments owed bank creditors, some of which are now more than
90 days overdue. The central bank has refused to finance the govern-
ment's deficit and will not use the $1.4 billion in reserves that it
holds to pay the arrears. Peru is out of compliance with its IMF pro-
gram as a result of the fiscal deterioration, and a $45 million drawing
has been suspended. Emergency measures to generate revenues are under
consideration, but it is doubtful that the situation will be corrected
quickly.
In early September, the Philippine authorities submitted a letter
of intent to the IMF. The Philippines will be required to take certain
prior actions before the Fund management approves the proposed stand-by
arrangement, including measures to maintain reserve money (a type of
monetary base) within a certain range, reduce budget expenditures, and
raise government revenues. At a specified date, the peso will be
floated freely, and the exchange taxes imposed earlier--such as the
stabilization tax on exports and the excise tax on foreign exchange-
will be abolished. Prime Minister Virata and Central Bank Governor
Fernandez are to meet with the head of the Bank Advisory Committee to
resolve the problem of the deposits in Manila that Citibank froze last
October. The bankers are insisting on a resolution of that problem
before they go ahead with new loans and rescheduling. The Managing
Director of the IMF wants an assurance that the proposed stabilization
package can be financed before he gives his final approval. He will
also need indications of financial support from official creditors. If
this support is forthcoming, the IMF Board could consider the program in
early November.
