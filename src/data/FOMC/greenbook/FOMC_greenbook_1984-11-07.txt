DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Final demand appears to have picked up again in September, as there
were healthy gains in consumer spending, housing starts, and business
equipment outlays. At the same time, much of the recent growth in spending
has been met by reduced inventory investment and rising imports, thereby
damping the stimulus to domestic production. The rise in payroll employment
in September was much smaller than the average gains registered earlier
in the year, and industrial production declined in September for the first
time since the recovery began. On balance, wage and price inflation has
maintained the relatively moderate pace observed earlier in the year.
Industrial Production
Industrial production dropped 0.6 percent in September, after edging
up just 0.1 percent in August. About half of the September decrease was
due to reduced motor vehicle production, which had been affected by the
one-week strike at General Motors as well as by continuing production
problems related to the availability of quality parts. Declines also
occurred in the output of other consumer goods, metals, construction sup-
plies, and materials for a second consecutive month. Business equipment
production continued to expand in September, although at a slower rate than
during the preceding five months.
Limited information suggests that output in several sectors that had
depressed industrial production in September, most importantly metals and
motor vehicles, will be unchanged or slightly higher in October. The
significant curtailment of steel output, under way since June, did not
continue into late September and early October. In the auto sector, current

estimates indicate production was 7.0 million units at an annual rate in
October, marginally higher than the 6.9 million unit rate posted in September.
With the ending of the strike at GM factories in Canada, auto assemblies
currently are scheduled to rise to about an 8 million unit annual rate in
November and December.
Employment and Unemployment
The growth in labor demand slowed considerably in the third quarter,
with monthly advances in nonfarm payroll employment averaging about
half the pace observed in the first half of this year. In line with the
smaller gains in employment, the civilian unemployment rate in the third
quarter remained close to its second-quarter average of 7.5 percent.
However, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits edged up during
the first two weeks of October, an indication that layoffs may have
picked up in some sectors.
Employment, as measured by the payroll survey, rose just 65,000 on a
strike-adjusted basis in September, continuing the slowdown that began in
July. In manufacturing, employment fell 125,000, with declines particularly
notable in the metals, machinery, and apparel industries--sectors in which
new orders had weakened during the summer months. Outside of manufacturing,
employment growth in the services industry, which had been quite strong
earlier in the recovery, slowed in September after accounting for the
return to work of 50,000 striking hospital workers; in contrast, strong
employment gains were reported at trade establishments and by local govern-
ments.
In the household survey, employment rose 270,000 in September after
declining in the two preceding months. As in many recent months, the household

survey reported that large changes in employment and the labor force occurred
again among youth, but such changes may be reflecting seasonal adjust-
ment problems. Jobless rates for most demographic groups have changed very
little, on balance, since May.
Personal Income and Consumption
Personal income rose at a $26.1 billion annual rate in September, a
pickup from the two preceding months. Higher interest and dividend receipts
contributed substantially to income growth last month, adding almost
$8 billion to the September advance. Wage and salary disbursements, boosted
by continued gains outside of the manufacturing sector, rose $11.7 billion.
Manufacturing payrolls declined in September, owing to reduced factory
hiring as well as to the six-day strike at General Motors. For the third
quarter as a whole, growth of real disposable income slowed to a 3.5 percent
annual rate, compared with a 7-1/2 percent pace in the first half of the year.
Real consumer outlays rebounded in September, after two consecutive
monthly declines. Expenditures at retail outlets retraced part of their
earlier declines, while spending on consumer services continued to trend
upward. The broadly-based increases in spending at the retail level included
sharp gains among such largely discretionary items as apparel and general
merchandise. Sales at gasoline stations rose in September, in part reflecting
the turnaround in gasoline prices.
Sales of domestically-produced new automobiles have been influenced
recently by a variety of supply factors. Problems with parts availability
and auto strikes at General Motors plants, both in the U.S. and Canada,
have limited production and exacerbated the existing tight inventory
situation. As a result, domestic auto sales during the past several weeks

have sagged to about a 7-1/2 million unit annual rate, considerably below
the 8.2 million unit pace seen in the first half of 1984. Sales of foreign
cars held steady at a 2.4 million unit annual selling pace in the third
quarter.
On the whole, the consumer surveys of the Michigan Survey Research
Center and the Conference Board continued to point to a high level of
consumer optimism. The Michigan index of consumer sentiment advanced in
September to just below the recent peak of March 1984. The Conference
Board measure, while lower than in the first half of 1984, remained at a
relatively high level through October.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment expanded another 8 percent at an
annual rate in the third quarter--a rapid pace, but well below the extra-
ordinary rate of expansion during the preceding year. Virtually all of the
third-quarter gain was in equipment spending. In particular, outlays for
machinery, including high-technology items as well as heavy industrial
machinery, continued to expand rapidly. Shipments of nondefense capital
goods by domestic producers, which were relatively weak in July and August,
rebounded sharply in September. In addition, there was a substantial rise
in imports of capital goods.
In the nonresidential construction sector, nominal expenditures fell
in both June and July and showed only a small gain in August. Outlays for
commercial and industrial construction were little changed, on balance, in
July and August relative to the second quarter. In contrast, petroleum
drilling and mining showed a small increase in the third quarter, after
declining sharply over the first half of the year.

Most forward-looking indicators point to continued growth in investment
spending, although at much slower rates than observed earlier in the recovery.
New orders for nondefense capital goods weakened in the summer months but
rose about 2-1/2 percent in September, and the backlog of unfilled orders
showed a small gain for the third quarter as a whole. Growth in the value
of new contracts for nonresidential construction also slowed in the third
quarter from the rapid pace posted over the previous year. The McGraw-Hill
survey of plant and equipment spending plans for 1985 (confidential until
November 9) reported that businesses expect to increase capital expenditures
by nearly 10 percent in 1985, following the 14 percent gain projected for
this year by the August Commerce Department survey.
Business Inventories
Business inventories rose rapidly in July and August, advancing at an
average annual rate of $23-3/4 billion in real terms. The pace was somewhat
faster than the second-quarter average of $19-3/4 billion, mainly because
of a more rapid rise in wholesale inventories. With sales slackening in
July and August, the overall inventory-to-sales ratio based on constant-dollar
values edged up to 1.53, slightly higher than the average level during the
first half of this year.
Manufacturers' inventories rose at an annual rate of $15-3/4 billion
in August, roughly the same as the average pace since February. Although
factory stocks are still low relative to sales by historical standards,
recent production and employment data suggest that a number of industries,
most notably metals, apparel, and machinery, have adjusted their production,
apparently in an attempt to slow further inventory accumulation. Indeed,

the book value of manufacturers' inventories rose at only a $19 billion
annual rate in September, about half the pace recorded in August. By and
large, recent inventory problems have been in industries that are particularly
vulnerable to import competition and that have experienced some softening
in orders in recent months; both are factors that may have contributed to a
lowering of sales expectations for the near term.
In the trade sector, wholesale inventories grew rapidly over the
summer; the increase was concentrated in stocks of motor vehicles, electrical
goods, and hardware, and may consist of a sizable portion of imports.
Retail inventories rose, on balance, only slightly in July and August.
Stocks at general merchandise and apparel stores were quite high relative
to sales through August, but strong gains in sales in September may have
led to some improvement in their inventory positions. Auto dealers' stocks
continued to be drawn down in September, owing to the disruptions to auto
production.
Housing Markets
Housing activity rebounded somewhat last month, after weakening
throughout the summer. Total housing starts in September rose 9 percent,
after an August decline to the lowest rate since late 1982. The September
advance was broadly based; single-family and multifamily starts increased
by similar margins, and starts rose in all four regions of the country.
In addition, sales of new homes rose sharply in September, more than
reversing the downtrend of the previous two months.
In contrast to the upturn in housing starts during September, newly
issued residential building permits fell for the third consecutive month,

as a sharp drop in multifamily permit issuance more than offset a moderate
rise in single-family permits. However, the steep decline in the multifamily
component of permits last month was due in part to a distortion in seasonal
factors resulting from the phasing out of federal subsidies for construction
of low-income housing under the Section 8 program. In previous years, this
program had triggered a runup in permits at the end of the fiscal year.
Federal Government
The federal government recorded a deficit of $175 billion in fiscal
year 1984, $20 billion less than in the preceding year. Receipts rose
$66 billion in FY1984, owing to the sharp rise in income over the period,
an end to the phase-in of income tax cuts that began in 1981, and the
increase in social security tax rates last January. In addition to boosting
receipts, the rise in economic activity cut the growth of outlays, particularly
for unemployment insurance. A sharp reduction in agricultural support
payments also helped limit the increase in outlays. However, defense
expenditures and interest payments were up by substantial amounts.
During the final days of the 98th Congress, three important fiscal
1985 budget measures were enacted. First, agreement was reached on a
budget resolution that projects a deficit of $181 billion for the current
fiscal year and somewhat larger deficits in FY1986 and FY1987. Second, a
continuing resolution was enacted; it provides interim FY1985 funding for
agencies operating without appropriations, as only four of the thirteen
required appropriations bills had been passed. The interim funding levels
are roughly consistent with the budget resolution. Finally, the debt
ceiling was raised to $1.823 trillion. Based on the figures in the budget

resolution, the higher debt limit is expected to be sufficient for financing
needs through the end of fiscal 1985.
State and Local Government
Activity in the state and local sector continued to expand in the
third quarter as real outlays for goods and services increased substantially
for the third consecutive quarter. As was the case earlier in the year,
a large advance was reported for real construction expenditures, most
likely reflecting ongoing public works programs, particularly for highways
and roads. Employment in the state and local sector expanded rapidly in
September for a third consecutive month.
Over the past year and a half, the fiscal position of the state and
local sector, as a whole, has strengthened remarkably, and large surpluses
in the operating and capital accounts have been reported for the first time
since early 1981. However, with economic activity slowing, surpluses
probably dropped in the third quarter. Furthermore, referenda will
appear on many state ballots in November that would either reduce state
taxes or limit governmental spending. In contrast, several states
operating with relatively weak fiscal positions have taken action to raise
taxes. In fiscal year 1984, tax reductions were more numerous than tax
increases, but quantitatively the effect of increases outweighed the effect
of reductions by an estimated $1 billion.
Exports and Imports
The merchandise trade deficit widened in September from the August
level, but was less than the extraordinary July deficit; imports increased
in September while exports were little changed. For the third quarter as a

II-17
whole, the trade deficit was more than $30 billion (annual rate) larger
than in either the first or second quarter.
The strong increase in imports in the third quarter occurred among a
wide range of manufactured goods. The increase reflected, in part, the
effects of the strong exchange value of the dollar on the relative prices
of imported goods and the continued growth of income in the United States.
The value of exports in the third quarter was slightly higher than in the
second quarter. Some of the increase in exports was in intermediate products
such as electronic parts and equipment to the Far East and automotive parts
to Canada, a significant portion of which return to the United States after
further processing.
As a result of the rising value of the dollar and moderate foreign
inflation, prices of non-oil imports in July and August were little changed
from their second-quarter levels. The price of imported petroleum drifted
down during this period and in September. (Further discussion of international
economic developments is included in Part IV.)
Prices
Consumer prices for goods and services continue to increase at a 4
to 5 percent annual pace; the consumer price index advanced 0.4 percent
in September. The producer price index for finished goods fell 0.2 percent
in September and has remained essentially constant over the past two quarters.
The decline in producer prices in September was the result of an
0.8 percent drop in energy prices, which are lagged one month in the PPI,
and a 0.4 percent decrease in finished foods prices. Excluding food and
energy, producer prices for both capital equipment and finished consumer
goods were unchanged last month. Price stability also was evident, on

II-18
balance, at the intermediate stage of processing; the prices for intermediate
materials excluding food and energy were unchanged in September, bringing
the increase in the third quarter to just 0.5 percent at an annual rate.
Consumer food prices declined 0.1 percent in September, after a 0.6
percent increase in August. Prices for fresh vegetables reversed some of
their August climb, while the prices of fresh fruit rose sharply last month.
Prices for beef and pork fell in September, and recent developments in
commodity markets suggest that meat prices may continue to fall in coming
months.
Retail energy prices advanced 0.6 percent in September, the largest
monthly increase since April. A 1.1 percent jump in gasoline prices, which
only partially retraced the summer declines, was primarily responsible for the
increase. Nevertheless, spot prices for both crude oil and refined petroleum
products have dropped recently, suggesting the September spurt in gasoline
prices could be temporary. Electricity and natural gas prices rose slowly
last month, after large increases in August.
Excluding food and energy, the consumer price index rose 0.4 percent
in September, after a 0.5 percent increase the preceding month. Over the
first nine months of 1984, this measure of inflation has been running at
about a 5 percent annual rate, the same pace as observed last year. Prices
for services increased 0.4 percent in September, while the prices of consumer
commodities advanced 0.5 percent.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage inflation remained relatively moderate through the third quarter.
The comprehensive employment cost index for wage and salary rates rose at a
3-1/4 percent annual rate during the July to September period. Over the

first three quarters of 1984, this wage measure has been running at a bit
less than a 4 percent annual rate, about 1 percentage point less than
the figure recorded in 1983. Much of the slowing this year has come from
smaller wage adjustments for white-collar workers, who enjoyed fairly
sizable real wage gains, on balance, during the previous two years.
Union settlements have generally been quite temperate this
year. First-year wage adjustments under major collective bargaining
agreements that were signed during the first nine months of 1984 averaged
2.5 percent exclusive of COLAs; this is nearly identical to the record low
posted last year for this series, which dates back to 1968.1 Pay cuts and
wage freezes in new contracts have been less prevalent this year than
during 1982 and 1983, but at the same time first-year guaranteed wage
increases in excess of 8 percent have virtually disappeared. Wage adjust-
ments for all union workers have averaged a bit less than those for nonunion
workers for almost two years now, in marked contrast with the 1970s and
early 1980s when union-nonunion wage differentials widened steadily.
For the private nonfarm sector as a whole, hourly compensation, which
includes fringe benefits and employer payroll taxes in addition to wages,
increased at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate in the third quarter. At the same
time, productivity in the nonfarm business sector--which had shown strong
cyclical gains earlier in the recovery--was unchanged last quarter.
Productivity typically levels out or declines when output growth slows
1. The latest data do not include the recently ratified contracts at
General Motors and Ford that call for an initial wage hike averaging 2-1/4
percent plus COLAs and profit-sharing.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have declined substantially since the October FOMC
meeting, extending the downtrend that began this summer. Most market rates
are now 1-1/2 to 2-1/4 percentage points below their highs for the year.
Continuing evidence of slower economic growth and subdued inflationary
pressure helped to sustain the rally in October. In addition, the market
was buoyed by an appreciable easing in the federal funds rate as discount
window borrowing averaged below $1 billion and large banks evidently modi-
fied the cautious approach to reserve management that characterized the
first months following Continental Illinois' funding crisis. The biggest
yield declines have been registered by private short-term instruments, with
commercial bank liabilities participating fully in the narrowing of risk
premiums even as reports of increased loan loss provisions made the
headlines.
Market optimism that Federal Reserve policy will remain on the less
restrictive side has been based in part on continued sluggish monetary
growth. Incoming data for M1 and M2 have pointed to renewed weakness in
October after a brief reacceleration in September; both aggregates are
in the lower halves of their annual target ranges. M3, meanwhile, appears
to be holding near the upper bound of its 1984 range.
Private sector borrowing has slowed somewhat on balance since the
summer, but has still been quite strong. A slackening of short-term borrow-
ing by nonfinancial businesses has reflected primarily a marked shift
toward long-term financing to take advantage of lower bond rates. Mortgage
borrowing by households has diminished, and consumer debt growth apparently
has been below the ebullient pace of the first half of the year. In the

public sector, borrowing by state and local governmental units continued
strong in September and October. A surplus in the federal budget in Sep-
tember resulted in a somewhat lower volume of Treasury borrowing in that
month, but heavy federal borrowing resumed in October.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Following a moderate rebound to a 6 percent annual rate of growth
in September, M1 weakened again in the first half of October, placing
this aggregate well below the midpoint of its 4- to 8-percent target range.
Runoffs of demand deposits resumed in early October after an interlude of
moderate expansion in September; other checkable deposits also had been
drawn down by mid-month. Currency expansion in October apparently moved
only a bit above the sluggish pace registered during September.
M2 growth picked up in September to an 8 percent annual rate, but
evidently slowed somewhat in October. Its nontransactions component
accelerated to an 8-1/2 percent rate of growth in September and apparently
remained close to that pace in October. Inflows to general purpose and
broker/dealer money market mutual funds quickened in September and October
as returns posted on the funds (which included effective capital gains)
moved down more slowly than market interest rates.
The drop in market interest rates also enhanced the attractiveness of
retail nontransactions instruments offered by depository institutions, on
which rate adjustments have lagged market movements. Weekly data indicate
that MMDAs increased in early October, likely heralding the first monthly
increment in these accounts since April. Small time deposits, although
slowing somewhat, nevertheless grew at a brisk 17-3/4 percent rate in
September, and data for commercial banks suggest only a modest further

III-4
slowing in the first half of October. In addition, outflows from savings
deposits have abated since August.
M3 recovered from its sluggish August pace to grow at a 7-3/4 percent
annual rate in September, and was at the top of its 1984 target range of 6
to 9 percent. Growth in the non-M2 component of M3 edged up only slightly
in September to a 7 percent annual rate; however, available data suggest
that this component accelerated sharply in October, despite apparently
larger runoffs of term Eurodollars. Inflows to institution-only money
market funds had picked up in September as market yields declined relative
to returns recorded on these accounts, and even stronger inflows were
recorded in October. Growth of large time deposits (net of MMMF holdings)
may have strengthened again in October after subsiding further in September.
Growth of large time deposits in September had been restrained by a
runoff in these deposits at thrift institutions. The contraction at thrifts
reflected in large part the problems of Financial Corporation of America,
whose S&L subsidiary had issued massive amounts of these deposits earlier,
and in part some easing of demands for mortgage credit; thrifts evidently
resumed net issuance of large time deposits in October. At commercial
banks, a runoff of gross large time deposits in September and sizable
issuance in early October were apparently in response to sharp swings in
U.S. government deposits. Treasury deposits surged in September, reducing
the need for managed liabilities, then were drawn down in October when
debt-ceiling problems were not resolved until midmonth.
Bank credit expanded at a 7-1/4 percent annual rate during September,
a little slower than in August. Banks substantially reduced their holdings
of U.S. Treasury securities, principally in their investment accounts, and

III-5
cut back some on their acquisition of other securities. Loan growth, in
contrast, increased moderately in September--to a 9-1/4 percent rate--but
was much slower than earlier in the year; incoming data indicate that loan
expansion at large banks may have slackened in October. There are wide-
spread reports that concerns about capital adequacy are leading large banks
to pursue less aggressive lending and placement policies, with particular
emphasis on limiting low margin assets. Business loan growth moderated in
September, in part owing to an easing of merger-related lending. Consumer
loan growth at banks slowed markedly, while real estate lending was little
changed from the reduced pace of the previous two months. Security loans
bounced back sharply from their August decline, apparently reflecting the
demands of nonbank dealers for financing of their enlarged holdings of U.S.
Treasury securities.
Business Finance
Business demands for bank loans and short-term market credit eased
considerably in the third quarter as a whole, despite a widening of the
gap between capital spending and internal sources of funds at nonfinancial
corporations. In September, for the first time this year, growth in the
total of nonfinancial commercial paper and business loans at domestic
banking offices and foreign branches of U.S. banks dropped below a 10
percent annual rate; third-quarter growth was at about half the rate of
the second quarter. Declines in corporate bond rates have encouraged
businesses to shift to longer-term financing, both to support current
business activity and to refinance short-term merger-related debt incurred
earlier. Public bond offerings by nonfinancial firms were substantial
both domestically and in the Eurodollar market during the third quarter.

The trend toward longer-term debt issues continued in October, even
though commercial paper borrowing apparently picked up, too. The gross
volume of bonds publicly offered in domestic markets by all types of busi-
nesses was $10 billion, well above the already strong monthly average for
the third quarter. An additional $2.5 billion was offered abroad. Moreover,
the average maturity of fixed-rate bonds issued by nonfinancial firms was
much longer in October than in any other month this year, and the issuance
of variable-rate and extendible notes moderated considerably during Septem-
ber and October from the preceding three months.
The volume of corporate bond issuance in the U.S. market in recent
months has been buoyed by the sale of medium-term notes. Activity in this
sector, which for years consisted almost exclusively of issues by auto
finance companies, has gained momentum as smaller captive finance companies,
other financial institutions, and even some industrial issuers have entered
the market as an alternative to commercial paper issuance. Seventeen
corporations have sold medium-term notes so far this year, compared with
three in 1983. These notes are issued in a manner similar to commercial
paper but at longer maturities. The notes are offered continuously on a
best-efforts basis through dealers at maturities selected by the purchasers--
from a minimum, usually, of nine months to a maximum of 3 to 10 years, with
coupon rates varying with maturity. The volume of medium-term notes offered
during the third quarter was about $2.7 billion, more than double the
average issuance earlier in the year.
Stock prices have fluctuated since the last FOMC meeting, with most
broader indexes ending up as much as 2 percent higher. An exception was the
AMEX index, which declined 1-3/4 percent due mostly to the poor performance

of oil stocks. Market values of S&L stocks outperformed the broader indexes
during this same period, as their earnings prospects improved with recent
declines in interest rates. The estimated $2.3 billion volume of new stock
issued during the month was about unchanged from the monthly average so far
this year, and was sluggish compared with the monthly average of $4.3 bil-
lion for 1983.
Government Finance
Federal sector. The staff at present is projecting a combined (on-
and off-budget) deficit of $71 billion for the current calendar quarter.
The Treasury is expected to reduce its cash balance by about $14 billion
during the quarter, and to borrow about $58 billion, net, from the public.
Net bill financing could well total $20 billion, accounting for its largest
share of marketable borrowing since the last quarter of 1982, when financing
needs had reached a peak. Although gross issuance of bills is expected to
rise just slightly, a reduced volume of maturing bills (which were issued
under debt-ceiling constraints last spring) should result in an enlarged
net volume.
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury operated under a restric-
tive statutory debt ceiling. The normal end-of-quarter auctions of 4- and
7-year notes and 20-year bonds, originally scheduled for late September, were
postponed twice. Finally, on October 13 the ceiling was raised by $251 bil-
lion to $1,824 billion. The disruption forced the Treasury to insert the
postponed auctions into an already heavy calendar; as a result, the Board
staff estimates that the Treasury will sell more than $80 billion, gross,
of coupon securities over the period from mid-October to the end of the year.
In conjunction with the domestic auction of 4-year notes, the Treasury

has auctioned for the first time $1 billion of 4-year notes specially
targeted to foreign buyers. Investment bankers submitted bids totaling
four times the amount auctioned, and the average effective annual yield
was nearly 35 basis points below that of the domestic issue; retail demand
for the notes appears moderate, with the most recent quotes on the targeted
issue maintaining about the initial yield spread relative to the companion
domestic note.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies slowed sharply
in October, owing largely to a cutback by the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
Its reduced borrowing needs reflected a lighter volume of advances to
S&Ls generally, and the renewed ability of the Financial Corporation of
America to raise some funds directly in the credit markets. Borrowing by
the other sponsored agencies continued its moderate third-quarter pace into
October.
The Federal National Mortgage Association recently announced an after-
tax loss of $43 million for the third quarter. The loss was the result of
a negative interest margin totaling $56 million and an addition of $35
million to the allowance for loan losses. The addition to the loan loss
reserve followed upon an increase in FNMA's foreclosure rate during the
first three quarters. Most of the loans foreclosed have been long-term,
fixed-rate mortgages.
State and local sector. Gross offerings of long-term municipal
securities have continued strong in recent weeks. Offerings in October are
estimated at about $8.3 billion, seasonally adjusted, roughly equaling
the third-quarter average. The October offerings included several large
utility issues, as well as bonds earmarked for work on highways, schools,

III-12
and medical facilities. In the short-term tax-exempt market, volume has
fallen off as HUD recently ceased offering project notes amid confusion
regarding arbitrage restrictions contained in the Deficit Reduction Act.
The volume of tax-exempt bonds for single-family housing is estimated
to have totaled around $1.2 billion in October. The legislated state-by-
state ceilings for 1984 imply a maximum volume of about $15 billion of such
issues, should every state reach its limit. Thus far, more than $10 billion
have been sold.

Interest rates on municipal bonds rose during the first few weeks
after the last FOMC meeting, but reversed direction in mid-October. The
Bond Buyer revenue and general obligation bond indexes are both down about
10 basis points since the last FOMC meeting. At the same time, though,
rates on taxable securities dropped appreciably more, and the ratio of

III-13
tax-exempt to taxable yields thus has increased sharply further, reaching
its highest level since June 1983.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates in the primary mortgage market continued to decline
during the intermeeting period. Average contract rates on new commitments
for conventional fixed-rate mortgages at S&Ls had slipped 21 basis points
to 14.05 percent by late October. The effective yield on commitments for
FHA-insured loans at mortgage companies retreated about 45 basis points;
in light of market developments, the ceiling rate on VA-guaranteed loans
was cut 1/2 percentage point to 13 percent in late October.
On adjustable-rate home mortgages, the commitment rate on conventional
1-year ARMs at S&Ls has dipped about 10 basis points to 11.90 percent since
the October FOMC meeting. The spread favoring 1-year ARMs over fixed-rate
mortgages at S&Ls has narrowed about 60 basis points since June, when the
Treasury yield curve was especially steep. Nevertheless, ARMs apparently
have remained the dominant instrument in the conventional home loan market--
in September, two-thirds of conventional loans closed at major originators
carried adjustable-rate features.
In secondary markets, yields on fixed-rate instruments have fallen
about 55 basis points since the previous FOMC meeting. For adjustable-rate
loans, required yields posted by FNMA under its standard purchase program
moved down 70 basis points on contracts that permit annual interest rate
adjustments.
New mortgage commitments at federally insured S&Ls were down in
September for the fourth consecutive month, leaving mortgage commitments
outstanding about 5 percent below the June peak of $67 billion. With

mortgage swap activity and mortgage acquisitions both subsiding, the
net growth in S&L mortgage assets diminished to $5.7 billion--about half
the record increase attained in June.
New issues of federally guaranteed mortgage pass-through securities
declined in September from the 1984 high reached in the prior month.1
FHLMC- and FNMA-underwritten pass-through issues, which had increased in
July and August on the strength of vigorous swap activity, tapered off in
September. Issuance of GNMA-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities fell
further during the third quarter in response to the earlier rise in interest
rates as well as to the unusually low FHA/VA share of home mortgage origi-
nations, attributable to stiff competition from conventional ARMs.
The rate of expansion in residential mortgage debt outstanding was
apparently trimmed a percentage point or so in September from the nearly
11 percent rate of the previous three months. That rate, in turn, was
about 1-1/2 points below the high reached in May.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit has moderated from the unusually
rapid pace of the first half, although remaining strong relative to past
economic recovery periods. Installment debt outstanding increased at a
16-1/2 percent annual rate in August, compared with nearly 20 percent in
July and 24 percent during the second quarter. Preliminary data--based
primarily on commercial banks and retail stores--suggest some further
1. Private sector pass-through securities have comprised a scant 2.5 percent
share of total new issue volume. However, the Secondary Mortgage Market
Enhancement Act, signed October 3, is designed to encourage an expansion of
private issues of mortgage-backed securities. The Act exempts certain of
these issues from state securities and investment laws, and permits limited
forward trading.

slackening of growth in September. During the 21 months of economic re-
covery from the trough in November 1982 through August 1984, the cumulative
expansion in consumer credit totaled 28 percent, 6 percentage points more
than in the most rapid of the four previous recoveries (see chart on page
111-18), and nearly double the average for the four earlier periods.
The unusual strength in consumer credit during the current business
advance likely reflects both stronger than normal increases in new lending
and weaker than normal growth in repayments on outstanding loans. The
robust pace of spending on consumer durables has generated a heavy volume
of new borrowing. At the same time, the extended period of sluggish credit
growth prior to the business recovery set the stage for a relatively light
volume of repayments for several quarters into the recovery. More recently,
however, with loan repayments becoming more reflective of credit extended
during the recovery rather than before, repayments are no doubt accelerating,
thereby imposing more of a drag on net credit expansion. Together, the slow-
down in consumer spending during the third quarter and the probable swelling
of repayments have begun to squeeze the growth rate of consumer debt after
its explosive advance.
After modest increases between May and August, interest rates on
consumer loans at banks apparently have been stable to slightly higher.
According to an informal survey, a few banks have raised their offering
rates by 50 basis points or less since the end of August, while others have
made no change. Some banks noted that they expect to reduce rates in
November; in cases where loans are made with adjustable rates tied to the
prime rate, automatic reductions in offering rates will occur at the next
adjustment period in response to the recent drop in the prime.

At the automobile finance companies, new-car loan rates climbed
another 15 basis points in September, and have now risen more than 100
basis points since early spring. (An increase of 100 basis points would
add about $4 to the monthly payment on a typical auto loan.) The rise in
rates at auto finance companies this year has restored the customary posi-
tive spread between finance company and bank auto loan interest rates,
following a period in which the auto finance companies had supported the
car market with cut-rate financing.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted average value of the dollar is little changed
from its level at the time of the last FOMC meeting. The dollar has
exhibited considerable movement in the intermeeting period, however, amid
shifting opinion about the strength of U.S. economic activity, about the
implications of weakness in oil prices for different currencies, and
about Federal Reserve policy in the near term.
During the first half of the intermeeting period, the weighted-
average dollar rose to a new record level even as U.S.-foreign
interest-rate differentials continued to narrow (see chart). Market
commentary suggests that demand for dollars may have been sustained by
some further downward revision in expectations of U.S. inflation and by a
belief that economic growth in the United States would continue to
outpace growth elsewhere, particularly in Europe. Emerging weakness in
world oil prices also appeared initially to generate support for the
dollar, although the implications of oil price changes for the dollar are
not unambiguous.
Since mid-October, however, the dollar has fallen 2-2/3 percent
from its peak as U.S.-foreign short-term interest-rate differentials have
declined sharply further. (Longer-term differentials, though also
narrowing, showed much less change than short-term differentials.)
Factors in the dollar's drop appear to have included a reassessment of
the strength of U.S. economic activity, a backing away from initial

judgments of the likely magnitude and effects of oil price declines, and
a market perception that the Federal Reserve might be easing reserve
conditions more than had previously been thought. In addition,
intervention by
the Desk, may have provided some impetus to the dollar's decline.
While the dollar depreciated somewhat, on balance, against most
major currencies, it changed little against the Canadian dollar and
appreciated 1-3/4 percent against sterling. Canadian interest rates
moved somewhat lower along with U.S. rates in the intermeeting period,
and major banks in Canada reduced their prime rates from 13 to 12-1/2
percent late in the period. Sterling meanwhile was depressed by ongoing
labor problems and by the prospect of a reduction in British oil
revenues.
The Bundesbank
sold a moderate amount of dollars, concentrated in several actions
visible to the market; perhaps because its sales were reminiscent of the
very large sales of late September, they had a substantial, though
temporary, effect on the mark/dollar rate.
The Desk sold dollars against marks on
October 17. The Desk's sales on that day totalled $95 million and were
detected in the market. The Desk acted as the mark/dollar rate rebounded
from the low reached after the Bundesbank's intervention.

IV-4
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Data that were not available when the Commerce Department released
second-quarter balance of payments figures in mid-September reveal that
U.S. nonbank residents once again reported a sharp increase in their net
financial liabilities to foreigners in that quarter. A large portion of
this $5.5 billion net inflow appeared to be related to merger financing,
just as it was in the first quarter. Based on these data, the estimated
statistical discrepancy for the second quarter would be revised downward
to $7.8 billion from the $13.3 billion previously reported. (See line 10
of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions.)
In August, recorded capital inflows exceeded the $9 billion
merchandise trade deficit, although net inflows recorded over the two
month span of July and August totalled only a little more than 50 percent
of the trade deficit over the same period. Banks recorded a moderate net
capital inflow in August, a significant portion of which appears to be
associated with a reduction of bankers' acceptance claims on residents of
Japan. Private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury obligations were
quite large in August, totalling more than $6 billion (line 3). Nearly
$2 billion of net purchases can be attributed to the World Bank, which
actively manages its portfolio but is not expected to add much to its net
holdings of U.S. Treasury securities over the rest of the year. About $3
billion of the remaining $4 billion of securities purchases is accounted
for by net purchases by residents in the United Kingdom. A large part of
this figure reflects a $1.7 billion purchase of 30 year Treasury bonds by
a group of securities firms led by Salomon Brothers. The bonds, held in
custody in the United Kingdom, were used to support the issue of CATS

(Certificates of Accrual on Treasury Securities) that were marketed to
non U.S. residents in bearer form through Salomon Brothers' U.K.
affiliate.
It is widely believed that investors are especially attracted to
securities issued in bearer form. The large August volume of CATS issued
with Treasury obligations as backing tends to confirm this view, but may
exaggerate it, because investors may have purchased these particular
securities with unusual intensity in anticipation of imminent
restrictions on such issues. In any event, bearer CATS are unlikely to
figure prominently among U.S. Treasury obligations purchased by
foreigners after August, because on September 7 the Treasury did issue
regulations prohibiting further issuance of bearer instruments backed
more than 50 percent by U.S. government securities. It remains to be seen
if the Treasury issues targeted for foreigners, which seek to preserve
some of the anonymity of investors, are given a vigorous reception.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. corporate securities increased
slightly in August. The increase in foreign net purchases of U.S.
corporate bonds in part reflects the increased issuance of bonds in the
Euromarket by U.S. corporations through their domestic offices rather
than through finance affiliates in the Netherlands Antilles after the
repeal of withholding tax on interest paid to foreigners and the
concomitant legal changes. Prior to the repeal, finance affiliates in
the Netherlands Antilles were active in acquiring funds for U.S.
corporations, and these funds were recorded in the balance of payments
statistics as direct investment inflows when transferred to domestic
offices. By contrast, Eurobonds issued directly from the domestic office

IV-7
of a U.S. corporation are recorded as private foreign purchases of U.S.
securities. Evidence for September shows that U.S. corporations are
electing to offer an even greater proportion of their Eurobond issues
through their domestic offices.
Data on foreign official capital flows for August show a moderate
increase in G-10 dollar holdings in the United States. On the whole, OPEC
members decreased their dollar holdings in August, approximately
counterbalancing their buildup of dollar holdings in July. Other
countries collectively increased their holdings very little in August
Partial information for September shows
that official holdings at the New York Federal Reserve Bank declined
moderately,

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In September, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was larger than in
August but less than the record July level. For the third quarter as a
whole, the trade deficit was more than $30 billion larger, at an annual
rate, than in either the first or second quarters. Data for September and
the third quarter are not yet available on an international transactions
or GNP basis. Some preliminary assessments were made for this Greenbook;
the data and further discussion will be included in the Greenbook
supplement.
Imports in the third quarter increased sharply from the
second-quarter level. Despite sharp month-to-month volatility, the rate
of imports in all three months exceeded that recorded in the second
quarter. The increase for the third quarter as a whole was spread

among a wide range of commodity categories, particularly industrial
supplies and machinery. Among individual items, strong increases were
recorded for steel, chemicals, electronic equipment and parts, clothing
and textiles, and passenger car imports from Canada and Japan.
Oil imports declined slightly in the third quarter. The volume
imported decreased steadily during the period; a rate of about 5.3
million barrels per day (mbd) in September brought the quarterly average
to about 5.7 mbd. The price of imported oil dropped to about $27.30 per
barrel in September and reflected weak spot prices during the summer; the
average for the third quarter was about $27.80 per barrel. From the
summer until early October spot prices strengthened as OPEC reduced its
level of crude oil production. Recent cuts in prices by Norway, the
United Kingdom and Nigeria reflect a weakness in the price of light crude
oil relative to heavy crude oil.

The value of exports in the third quarter was slightly higher than
in the second quarter. The increase was largely in manufactured goods
(especially machinery and industrial supplies). The value of
agricultural exports in the third quarter was maintained at the
second-quarter rate because a sharp increase in wheat shipments (largely
to the Soviet Union) offset declines in other commodities (particularly
soybeans and corn).

IV-11
Foreign Economic Developments. Economic expansion in major
foreign industrial economies is continuing, except in the United
Kingdom, where the coal miners' strike continues to depress industrial
production. Although industrial production in Germany also declined
somewhat in August, after a substantial post-strike recovery in July,
other indicators suggest a continuing expansion. In Japan, industrial
production has decelerated in the last year but in the third quarter
was about 11 percent above its year-earlier level. Industrial
production during the summer rose in Canada, France, and Italy,
although the pace of the advance in each country was uneven. The most
recent unemployment rate in each of the major foreign countries is
above the level at the beginning of this year.
Inflation rates remained low or have continued to decline in the
major foreign countries. In September, the year-on-year increase of
the trade-weighted average of consumer price indices in the foreign
G-10 countries was 4-1/4 percent, the lowest since the early 1970s and
1-1/2 percentage points below the rate of a year earlier.
The cumulative current account surplus for Japan through the
third quarter was $31 billion (s.a.a.r.), an increase of $11 billion
from the corresponding period of last year. The external position of
the United Kingdom deteriorated further in the third quarter while the
French trade balance continued to improve.
Individual Country Notes. Industrial production in Japan rose in
the third quarter by 1.6 percent (s.a.), the slowest rate of advance
since early 1983. This deceleration was widely expected and coincides
with the government forecast of a slowing of activity from the rapid

rate of the first half of this year. In August, new housing starts
rose by 2.6 percent (s.a.), following a 4.4 percent gain in July, while
new construction orders advanced significantly in both months. Retail
sales rose by more than 5 percent (s.a.) in September following an over
3 percent drop in August. Abnormally hot summer weather is said to
explain in part this pattern of sales. Labor market conditions
improved somewhat during the summer: unemployment declined marginally
from June's record level of 2.81 percent and overtime work picked up in
August. The sizeable increases in consumer prices in September and
October are believed to reflect mainly seasonal factors; year-on-year
increases remain low.
Both the trade and current account surpluses rose in September.
The cumulative trade surplus through September was $42 billion
(s.a.a.r.), compared with a surplus for the same period of last year of
$31 billion.
Negotiations within the government are continuing over the budget
for FY 1985 (beginning April 1). Prime Minister Nakasone, who was
re-elected to a second two-year term on October 31, remains committed
to a reduction of the government deficit, while Finance Minister
Takeshita has mentioned that proposals are being considered for a tax
cut to stimulate domestic demand. A draft of the FY 1985 budget is
expected in late December or early January. The Finance Ministry has
also floated proposals aimed at reducing tax evasion associated with
the establishment of multiple tax-free savings accounts. At present,
an individual can legally exempt from taxation interest received on
holdings of up to 3 million yen each (or a total of approximately

IV-16
$37,000) in bank savings deposits, postal savings accounts, and
government bonds. On October 29 the long-term prime rate was lowered
from 7.9 percent to 7.6 percent in line with declines in government
bond rates.
Industrial production in Germany has rebounded from the strike-
induced losses incurred in June. The index for July-August was 3
percent above its pre-strike level in April-May. Compared with last
year, July-August was up by 4.6 percent. Data on orders and business
climate surveys point toward further expansion. The rate of
unemployment, however, has remained high at 9.3 percent (s.a.) through
September.
Consumer price inflation continues to be moderate: consumer
prices in October were about 2 percent above the year-earlier level.
Wages and salaries in July were 2.5 percent above July of last year.
Negotiations continue between the government and Germany's largest
union, the public service employees. The government recently made an
offer of a 2.5 percent increase in compensation, while the union wants
a 5 percent raise plus an increase in paid annual leave from 30 to 40
days.
The cumulative current account through September was in balance,
compared with a $0.5 billion (a.r.) surplus for the same period of last
year. Similarly, the trade surplus so far this year is less than $2
billion (a.r.) smaller than last year's comparable figure.
The government's plan for a large tax cut scheduled for 1986
(DM 10 billion) and 1988 (DM 10 billion) remains officially unchanged
despite statements by the Economics Minister that the first cut should

IV-17
be advanced to 1985 in order to stimulate the economy.
Industrial production in the United Kingdom continued to decline
in August and its three-month average fell to 1 percent below its year-
earlier level. This weakness is in part the result of the ongoing coal
miners' strike. To date the effect of this strike on other industries
has been limited despite the substantial drop in coal output. About
three-fourths of the miners have remained away from work. Negotiations
to end the eight-month strike have made little progress; however, a
strike by the pit supervisors, which would have halted virtually all
coal production, has been avoided.
The U.K. unemployment rate rose 0.1 percent to 12.9 percent
(s.a.) in September. Retail prices rose slightly in September but the
year-over-year inflation rate fell to 4.7 percent.
The U.K.'s external position deteriorated sharply in the second
and third quarters. The trade deficit was $7.5 billion (s.a.a.r.) in
the third quarter, bringing the total deficit for the first nine months
of 1984 to $4.9 billion (s.a.a.r.), from $1.1 billion for the
comparable period in 1983. Although the U.K. oil account remains in
substantial surplus, future growth of this surplus is expected to be
tempered by the $1.35/barrel reduction in the price of British North
Sea oil, announced on October 17 in response to Norwegian price cuts.
The cumulative current account deficit for the first three quarters
equalled $440 million (s.a.a.r.), compared with a $4.7 billion surplus
for the comparable period in 1983. Fourth-quarter figures, however,
are expected to benefit by the release from the European Community of
the 1983 budget refund amounting to about $550 million.

IV-18
On Monday, October 1, the Bank of England purchased Johnson
Matthey Bankers (JMB), one of five members participating in the London
fix, for £1 in order to prevent the possible widespread effects of
its insolvency. The parent company (Johnson Matthey group) agreed to
contribute £50 million in new capital to JMB prior to its sale and
the leading U.K. financial institutions have supplied the Bank of
England with sizable indemnities in case the losses on JMB's commercial
loan portfolio exceed its (recently augmented) capital. To shore up
the parent company, the largest shareholders agreed to invest a further
£25 million in the Johnson Matthey group and a consortium of banks
have provided the group with a £250 million line of credit.
Industrial production in France rose by 4.6 percent (s.a.) in the
July-August period. However, this increase may reflect unusual
seasonal production patterns over the summer holiday period. Other
recent data continue to suggest weak economic activity. Real GDP data
for the second quarter were revised downward slightly, showing a 0.4
percent (s.a.) decline in the quarter and a year-over-year increase of
only 1 percent. The unemployment rate in September was unchanged at
10.1 percent (s.a.) following increases in nine of the previous ten
months. Inflation has continued to moderate with the year-over-year
consumer price inflation rate easing to 7.1 percent in September.
On October 29 the French government announced that its 1985
monetary target would be a growth rate of M2R in the range of 4 to 6
percent, down slightly from the 1984 target range of 5-1/2 to 6-1/2
percent. (M2R in June was 9.2 percent above its year-earlier level and
was up by 6.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) compared with its base period centered

IV-19
in December 1983.) The government also announced that the current
monetary control technique of placing ceilings on commercial bank
credit expansion will be removed at the end of this year and replaced
by a credit control system relying on commercial banks holding required
reserves at the Bank of France. Details of the new system remain to be
worked out.
There was a small trade surplus in September. For the first nine
months of this year, the cumulative trade deficit was $3 billion
(s.a.a.r.), less than half the deficit recorded in the same period last
year.
The latest industrial production data indicate that the economic
recovery in Italy is continuing; the average level of industrial
production was 2.5 percent higher in July and August than in the same
two months of 1983. Also, the unemployment rate fell from 10.4 percent
in the second quarter to 10.1 percent in the third quarter of 1984.
The official September household survey shows that consumers' outlooks
remain positive, with more families likely to buy consumer durables
than was the case in July. Consumers are also more confident that
inflation has moderated, and they expect this trend to continue. At
the end of September, the year-on-year inflation rate was 9.5 percent,
the lowest such rate since March 1973.
The government's proposed budget for next year calls for a
deficit equivalent to 15.7 percent of GDP in 1985, down from the latest
projection of 16.5 percent for 1984. Details of the budget proposals
are not yet available. Despite labor opposition, the government
appears to be counting on holding wage increases for government workers

IV-20
to 7 percent as a way to encourage wage restraint in the private sector
and to reduce inflationary expectations. If the rate of inflation is
brought down to 7 percent, Prime Minister Craxi has proposed that a new
"heavy" lira be issued in 1985 or later, worth 1000 of the current
lire.
The trade deficit for the first seven months of this year was
$9.8 billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with $8.7 billion in the same period
in 1983.
Economic expansion in Canada continues at a moderate pace.
Industrial production declined slightly in August following a sharp
jump in July; the July increase was associated with a pickup in the
automotive sector and an across-the-board increase in U.S. imports. On
October 29, Canadian U.A.W. members ratified a three-year contract,
ending the 13-day strike against General Motors. The contract includes
a larger increase in hourly wages and more paid time off than the
recent settlement with U.S. workers, but does not contain the job
security and training provisions of the latter. If inflation in both
countries were to average 5 percent over the next three years, average
wage rates for G.M.'s Canadian workers would rise about 20 percent,
compared with a 17 percent rise for U.S. workers. The unemployment
rate in August increased 0.6 percent from July to 11.8 percent (s.a.),
the highest rate in a year. The rise is associated with an increase in
the labor force rather than a decline in employment.
In September, the consumer price index stood only 3.8.percent
(s.a.) above its year-earlier level. The cumulative trade surplus
through August reached $15.6 billion (s.a.a.r.), somewhat higher than

IV-21
in the same period last year. An increasing service account deficit,
however, helped hold the current account surplus to $1 billion
(s.a.a.r.) in the first half of 1984, compared with $3.2 billion in the
comparable period last year.
In early October a Swedish government-appointed committee
formally recommended that a limited number of foreign banks be allowed
to establish subsidiaries in Sweden. Changes in the existing banking
laws, which prohibit foreign banking operations in Sweden, should take
place in July 1985 with foreign banks beginning operations in early
1986. Foreign banks would be required to provide the same range of
banking activities as domestic banks and would be regulated in the same
manner. Other restrictions include the prohibition of foreign banks
owning shares of any domestic banks or of any non-bank financial
institutions. In their first year of operations, foreign bank's equity
capital would be limited to a maximum of $9 million and a minimum of
$3 million.

IV-22
Debt Situation in Selected Developing Countries
The Philippines and Venezuela recently reached agreements in prin-
ciple with their bank creditors on multi-year reschedulings, and Argen-
tina, Brazil and Chile have begun or are about to begin discussions with
bank creditors on financing packages for 1985 and subsequent years.
Argentina and the Philippines are taking measures prerequisite to the
approval of IMF programs. Mexico, Brazil and Chile continue to operate
successfully under their IMF programs, although Brazilian inflation
remains high, and Chile has had to take additional measures to meet its
fiscal targets. Peru's external arrears continue to accumulate.
New lending to non-OPEC developing countries by banks in the BIS
reporting area continued at a relatively low level in the second quarter,
according to the BIS' latest quarterly report. The second-quarter data
show an increase in outstanding claims on non-OPEC developing countries
of $4.7 billion, after adjustment for the effects of exchange rate
changes. This brings the net increase for the first half to about $ 6
billion, close to the rate of net bank lending last year. (Coverage in
the quarterly series is less broad than in the semiannual series and has
usually shown a smaller volume of new lending.) Increases (unadjusted)
in claims on Mexico, Brazil and Chile reflected primarily drawings on
loans arranged earlier as part of financing packages, and accounted for
more than one-half of the total, but there seems also to have been an
increase in voluntary lending to Mexico. Much of the rest was accounted
for by new lending to Egypt and Israel.
Following the IMF Managing Director's acceptance of a letter of
intent, Argentina and its bank creditors opened discussions on a new
medium-term credit and restructuring. By late October, Argentina had

IV-23
eliminated interest arrears on public sector debts to bank through May 2
and repaid the $100 million short-term credit obtained from banks as part
of the March 30 package. The banks on the Working Committee have agreed
to another postponement of the repayment of the $750 million balance due
on the 1982 bridge loan; it is now scheduled for January 15. Inflation
intensified in September when the CPI rose by 27.5 percent to a level 687
percent higher than a year earlier. The peso price of the dollar rose
only by 23.4 percent in September; since the end of 1983, it has risen
about 26 percent less than the CPI. Another compensatory wage adjustment
was announced at the beginning of October to achieve a 6 percent increase
in real wages in the first nine months of the year. It is payable half
at the end of October and half at the end of November. Another wage
adjustment has been promised early next year to bring real wages in
December 1984 to a level 8 percent above a year earlier. By delaying
payment of these increases, the authorities hope to reconcile their
promises to the Argentine people with the commitments recently made to
the IMF on wage policies and the public sector deficit.
Brazil registered a trade surplus of $9.7 billion during the first
nine months of the year, exceeding the target of $9 billion for the
entire year. The current account deficit for 1984 is now expected to be
$2 billion, substantially below the IMF projection of $5.3 billion. The
general price index increased by 10.3 percent in September, not signifi-
cantly different from the average during the first eight months of the
year. The monetary base and M1 increased substantially in September as
the regulations passed in mid-September to restrict the growth of credit
do not appear to have been entirely successful in slowing such growth.

IV-24
Negotiations with creditor banks on a possible multi-year rescheduling
are expected to begin on November 14. Brazil is expected to have about
$8 billion in cash reserves by year-end and may not seek new credits from
banks in 1985.
Mexico's current account surplus in the first half of 1984 was $3.3
billion, $1 billion higher than in the first half of 1983. The surplus
is likely to narrow in the second half, reflecting some rise in imports
as the economy begins to recover and the lagged effect of the increase in
dollar interest rates in the second quarter. Nevertheless, the surplus
for the year is likely to reach about $4.5 billion, some $2 billion more
than previously projected, unless there is a significant decline in world
oil prices in coming days. The annual rate of increase in the CPI in the
first three quarters was 61 percent, down from 85 percent in the same
period of 1983. In the third quarter, the annual rate was 43.1 percent.
There continue to be indications that economic activity began to pick up
in the third quarter.
Chile would like to negotiate a rescheduling of debt due bank credi-
tors over 1985-90 and some reduction in interest charges. A request to
banks for about $800 million in new money for 1985 also looks likely.
Negotiations are expected to begin in November. Chilean authorities have
begun discussions with the IMF on a new arrangement to follow the
stand-by that expires at the end of this year. Chile has complied with
that program, but additional adjustment measures were taken in September
in order to remain in compliance through the end of the year.
Peru's external arrears continue to mount and are now about $300
million. Banks have discussed the possibility of disbursing $100 million

IV-25
(held over from a 1983 agreement) in return for an equivalent drawdown of
Peru's reserves and payment of interest arrears, but are divided on
whether to do this in the absence of a viable IMF program. The Peruvian
government is also divided on the proposal.
Venezuela's private sector interest arrears now exceed $1 billion.
Final approval of the rescheduling agreement reached last month is con-
tingent on the government making substantial progress in reducing those
arrears.
On October 11, the Managing Director of the IMF accepted the
Philippines' letter of intent for an 18-month stand-by arrangement. If
certain prior actions are taken, and if the Managing Director receives
assurances that adequate financing will be forthcoming, the program will
be sent to the Executive Board in early November. At that point, the
United States, Japan and Korea will provide bridge financing of $80
million until the Philippines is able to draw on the stand-by. In mid-
October, the peso was allowed to "float" and soon depreciated by about 10
percent. Later in October, the government raised petroleum product
prices and various retail prices, touching off public disturbances. The
exchange rate and price measures fulfill some of the prior actions
required by the IMF. On October 9, the Philippines was granted a fourth
90-day extension of the moratorium on the payment of principal to banks
on non-trade debt. On October 17 the advisory committee of creditor
banks announced it had reached agreement to reschedule over a 10-year
period about $5 billion in Philippine loans maturing between October 1983
and December 1986, to provide $925 million in new money, and also to
provide a revolving short-term trade facility of about $3 billion.
