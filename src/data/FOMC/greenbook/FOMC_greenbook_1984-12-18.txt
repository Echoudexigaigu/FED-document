 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic growth remained slow in the autumn. Consumer outlays and
capital goods orders have been weak since mid-year, leading to downward
production adjustments and a reduced pace of inventory investment in the
manufacturing sector. In addition, residential construction activity has
been subdued, although home sales have firmed. Despite the sluggishness in
goods output, however, employment-particularly in trade and services--posted
further gains in November. With little pressure on resource utilization,
wage and price inflation has maintained the relatively moderate pace observed
earlier this year.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production increased somewhat in November, but the rise
was primarily the result of a rebound of auto production from strike-affected
levels. Auto assemblies in November reached almost 8 million units at an
annual rate, sharply higher than the October pace of 7 million units.
In addition, more complete data for October suggest weaker industrial
activity than estimated initially. Capacity utilization in the industrial
sector was about unchanged in November, and remained about 1 percentage
point below the peak of 82.7 percent in the current cycle in July. (A more
complete discussion of industrial production in November will be included
in the Greenbook supplement, distributed December 14.)
Employment and Unemployment
Although factory hiring remained slow, total nonfarm payroll employment
rose 300,000 last month, after rising 345,000 in October. The bulk of the
new jobs in both months occurred in the services industry and at trade

establishments. In manufacturing, automakers boosted employment in
November after several months in which activity was depressed by strikes
and production problems. But the employment gains in auto and related
industries were partially offset by small losses in primary metals,
nonelectrical machinery, textile and apparel-industries that have been
particularly vulnerable to competition from imports. The overall factory
workweek edged up 0.1 hour in November to 40.5 hours, about the level
reported since last spring.
The civilian unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage point in November
to 7.2 percent, after four months of virtually no change. Throughout the
summer and early autumn, long-term joblessness continued to edge down, but
an increasing number of workers reported short spells of unemployment as
activity slowed. There were indications from both the household survey
results and data on initial claims for unemployment insurance that new
layoffs subsided somewhat during November.
Personal Income and Consumption
Growth in income has been fairly well maintained in recent months,
although the pace has been moderating as economic activity has slowed.
Personal income increased $18 billion in October, somewhat less than the
$21 billion advance in the third quarter and the average increase of $24
billion during the first half of this year. The slower income growth
in October primarily reflected smaller gains in wages and salaries, but
employment and hourly earnings information for November suggests that wage
and salary disbursements may have picked up somewhat last month.
Interest income continued to grow rapidly in October and has accounted for

an unusually large share of the rise in total personal income so far this
year.
Personal consumption outlays declined a little in October after a
sharp rise in the preceding month. Purchases of both durable and nondurable
goods fell, and spending on consumer services posted only a small increase.
Domestic car sales in November were unchanged from the relatively low 7.2
million unit annual rate reported in October. Sales of imported cars in
November continued at the strong 2.8 million unit pace of October, the
highest selling rate since early 1980.
Growth in personal consumption expenditures in the past several months
has been well below that of disposable personal income, and the personal
saving rate since mid-year has averaged around 6.5 percent, compared with
the rate of 5.9 percent during the first half of this year.
Consumer confidence in November reportedly remained at a relatively
robust level. The Michigan index edged down a little in November as house-
holds were a little more concerned about buying conditions for large household
durables and about prospects for business conditions in the next 12 months.
The Conference Board index of confidence, in contrast, increased to the
highest level since June with all questions on present and expected economic
conditions contributing to the advance.
Business Fixed Investment
Business investment spending has decelerated considerably in the past
several months. Growth in nonresidential construction slowed sharply in
the third quarter. Although spending on structures rose in October, the
increase was still well below the very rapid rate of expansion posted
earlier this year. On the equipment side, shipments from domestic capital

goods producers declined substantially in October across a wide range of
categories and imports of capital goods fell after rising sharply from July
to September.
Recent indicators of near-term investment spending have been weak.
New orders tor nondefense capital goods slackenea notably through the
summer and early autumn; by October the level of orders in this category
was about 6 percent below that in the first half of this year. In addition,
the value of new permits for nonresidential construction has been flat
since early this year, and the value of new contracts increased only 2.9
percent in the third quarter, considerably slower than the 8 percent rise
in the first half of 1984.
Nevertheless, business spending plans for 1985 as a whole still appear
relatively strong. Both the Merrill-Lynch and McGraw-Hill surveys report
that businesses plan to increase nominal plant and equipment spending by
around 10 percent next year. The Conference Board also reported that
newly-approved capital appropriations (net of cancellations) of the nation's
1,000 largest manufacturers excluding auto makers rose 15 percent in the
second quarter and 4 percent in the third quarter of this year, to a level
37 percent above that a year ago. On average, appropriations tend to
precede expenditures by about three to four quarters. These indicators
point to continued, but moderating, growth in outlays in the first half of
next year.
Business Inventories
Business inventory accumulation slowed in September, as overall
manufacturing and trade stocks rose at an annual rate of $19 billion in

constant-dollar terms, compared with the $23 billion pace during the first
eight months of this year. The moderation appears to have continued in
October in the manufacturing sector.
Faced with heavy competition from imports, manufacturers have moved
quickly to forestall inventory imbalances. As orders and shipments weakened
in recent months, producers in many industries began to trim their output,
although their inventory-to-shipments ratios often were still quite low
by historical standards. As a result, the growth in factory stocks has
slowed sharply since August. In September and October, the book value of
manufacturers' inventories rose at an average annual rate of $18.5 billion,
considerably slower than the $39 billion rate of investment maintained from
February to August.
Inventories at nonauto retail establishments, especially general
merchandisers and apparel stores, were quite high going into early autumn;
and with sales remaining flat into the fourth quarter, many establishments
appear to have adjusted their ordering policies and stepped up sales
promotion efforts in an attempt to pare their excess stocks. Auto dealers'
stocks expanded in November as strikes at General Motors plants ended and
auto production rose to nearly 8 million units at an annual rate. With
sales of only 7.2 million units, dealers reported a 61 days' supply at the
end of November.
Housing Markets
Residential construction remained sluggish through October, but home
sales appear to have begun to respond to the reduction in mortgage rates
since the summer. In October, sales of new single-family homes rose 2

percent after an 18 percent jump in September, bringing new home sales to
their highest level since March. Sales of existing homes, after a five-month
decline, leveled off in October.
On the construction side, total private housing starts fell almost 10
percent in October, to an annual rate of 1.5 million units; newly-issued
permits also posted a 2 percent drop. Both measures of new residential
construction activity were at their lowest point in nearly two years. The
lag in the response of residential construction to firmer sales figures
may, in part, reflect builders' desire to prevent further buildups in the
stock of unsold homes. Builders' inventories, while not extremely high in
historical perspective, increased noticeably during the first 10 months of
this year (chart).
In line with the generally favorable inflation environment, price and
cost increases remain moderate in the housing sector. Construction costs
for new units, measured by the fixed-weighted price index for residential
construction, were 4.2 percent above a year earlier in the third quarter.
Nationally, the average price of existing homes sold in October was about 4
percent above a year earlier-only slightly more than the average increase
during the preceding two years.
Federal Government
Federal unified budget outlays rose sharply in October from the third-
quarter pace, but the rise was largely attributable to a number of special
factors. October outlays included $3.1 billion of loans for low-income
housing projects-lending that was previously handled by the issuance
of guaranteed notes by local authorities. In addition, Federal outlays were

II-13
boosted by the makeup of a delay in September of periodic hospital reimburse-
ments under medicare and by normal seasonal influences.
Defense spending, which was about unchanged in the third quarter,
increased somewhat in October, primarily in the operations and maintenance
category. Defense procurement outlays declined, suggesting that the recent
pattern of defense shortfalls is continuing.
The Treasury released a tax reform study on November 27. The study
proposes a substantial broadening of the individual and corporate income
tax bases through the elimination of many tax preferences and loopholes,
with concurrent reductions in marginal tax rates. The Treasury study is
currently being reviewed within the administration and could form the basis
for an official legislative proposal presented at the time of the State of
the Union address or Budget Message in late January or early February.
State and Local Government
Real outlays for goods and services by state and local governments
have continued to increase this fall after a sharp advance in the third
quarter. In October, real spending for construction stood well above its
third-quarter average. Moreover, in November, employment in the sector was
80,000 above its third-quarter level.
The overall fiscal position of the sector has weakened lately. The
sharp economic slowdown reduced corporate tax receipts in the third quarter,
and federal grants to state and local governments also declined. With
rising outlays, the combined operating and capital budget surplus in the
state and local sector dwindled to just $2.5 billion in the third quarter
from an average of nearly $12 billion over the preceding year. In

II-14
the November elections, citizens defeated a variety of referenda aimed
primarily at restricting spending and reducing taxes in many states.
Exports and Imports
The merchandise trade deficit in October was substantially reduced
from the level in the third quarter. The narrower trade gap resulted from
a marked decline in imports; exports in October were at about the same
level as the third-quarter average. Although imports eased across a wide
range of commodity categories-machinery, industrial supplies, consumer
goods and agricultural products--the level of imports in October was still
quite high, reflecting the continued high value of the dollar and the
substantial demand for goods produced abroad.
Prices of non-oil imports in October were up only slightly from their
third-quarter average, as the rise in exchange rate continued to moderate
foreign price increases. The price of imported oil was about the same as
in September but was about 25 cents per barrel less than the average for the
third quarter. (Further discussion of international economic developments
is included in Section IV.)
Prices
Recent price reports indicate little evidence of a change in the
underlying rate of inflation. In October, the consumer price index for
all urban consumers rose 0.4 percent for the second month--only slightly
above the average pace earlier this year-while the producer price index
for finished goods fell 0.2 percent in both months.
Food prices at the consumer level rose 0.4 percent in October after
a small decline in September. So far this year, the food index has increased
at an average annual rate of nearly 4 percent, not much below the overall

CPI. In 1982 and 1983, by contrast, significantly smaller increases in food
prices played a more important role in holding down the advance in the CPI
total. At the producer level, prices in October edged down for finished
foods and fell for crude foods. Although spot prices for livestock have
rebounded since mid-October, futures prices for cattle and hogs have not
changed in the past few weeks.
Consumer energy prices were up 0.3 percent in October, less than in
September, as large increases for gasoline and fuel oil were partly offset
by declines for electricity and natural gas. In contrast to food, the
energy component has risen so far this year at an average annual rate
well below the CPI total--only 3/4 percent--thus contributing importantly
to a lower CPI for the third successive year. Moreover, the near-term
outlook for prices of petroleum-based products appears to be little
changed, as spot prices of gasoline and fuel oil have weakened again since
late September.
Aside from the food and energy sectors, consumer prices rose 0.3
percent in October, somewhat below the average pace of 5 percent at an
annual rate maintained since the end of 1982. Prices of services were
up 0.5 percent, about the average rate so far this year, but prices of
consumer commodities advanced only 0.2 percent after a large September
increase. Prices of new cars rose 0.2 percent in October, and used car
prices posted their third recent monthly decline after rising rapidly
over the first half of this year and most of 1982 and 1983. If used cars
were excluded, this year's rise in prices of CPI commodities less food and

II-17
energy would be around 2-1/2 percent, not much higher than the comparable
PPI component.
At the producer level, declines in the prices of new cars and trucks
were responsible for most of the October reduction in the PPI index for
finished goods less food and energy.1 However, producer prices also were
down for some other items in the finished consumer goods and capital
equipment categories. At an earlier stage of processing, prices of
intermediate materials less food and energy rose 0.2 percent in October,
about the average rate so far this year.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage inflation has continued to moderate this year, slowing to the
lowest rate of increase in the past 20 years. In November, the hourly
earnings index was only about 3 percent above the level of a year earlier,
compared with the 4 percent rise in 1983. Most of the deceleration in
wage inflation has been associated with smaller wage adjustments in the
service-producing sector of the economy.
In the nonfarm business sector, hourly compensation, which includes
wages, fringe benefits, and employers' contributions for social insurance,
rose at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate in the third quarter-the same as in the
preceding quarter. With inflation remaining fairly stable in recent years
and compensation increases getting smaller, gains in real hourly compensation
1. The October PPI indexes for new cars and trucks compare manufacturers'
prices for new models, after adjustment for quality changes, with September
prices for old models. The CPI differs in a number of ways, notably because
the prices of new models are phased in over several months in accordance with
the mix of sales and because the sample, which includes imports, is broader.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most interest rates have declined further on balance since the
November FOMC meeting, as the System has eased reserve availability and
cut the discount rate 1/2 point to 8-1/2 percent against a backdrop of
sluggish economic activity and subdued inflation. Federal funds, which
had been trading in a 9-1/2 to 10 percent range in early November, have
been below 9 percent most recently. Yields on other market instruments
have registered much smaller declines than this, especially in the longer
maturity area. Market sentiment was adversely affected by upward re-
visions in estimates of the federal deficit, stronger-than-anticipated
employment figures and the large M1 increase published in the latter part
of November.
All the monetary aggregates surged in November. Owing to the
earlier weakness, M1 remained in the lower part of its annual target
range, but M2, reflecting not only the rebound in M1 but also continued
acceleration in its nontransaction component, jumped to around the mid-
point of its range. M3 also accelerated in November and has moved farther
above the upper end of its target range.
Credit market borrowing has picked up on balance thus far in the
fourth quarter. Business credit demands have been massive in both
short- and long-term markets, partly because of heavy merger activity
but also because of the sizable gap between internal funds and capital
outlays. In addition, mortgage borrowing appears to be firming, and
a moderate pickup in consumer borrowing in October may have carried into
November. Tax-exempt bond issuance has been kept at high levels by
efforts to market debt before new statutory restraints take effect.

Meanwhile, the Treasury has been financing a huge quarterly deficit

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
A sharp rebound in M1 in November more than offset the contraction
in October.1 The expansion of M1, at roughly a 9 percent annual rate, was
attributable to a resurgence in demand and other checkable deposit cate-
gories; currency growth remained sluggish.
M2 registered its strongest growth yet this year, increasing at
a 15 percent annual rate in November. Its nontransaction component
accelerated to a 16 percent rate of growth with surges in overnight RPs,
MMDA balances, and assets of money market mutual funds. In addition,
the runoff of savings deposits slowed to a 4 percent rate.
The increase in RPs last month likely was related to the uptick
in bank holdings of Treasuries--primarily in trading accounts. The
strong inflows to money market funds and MMDAs occurred as yields on
these investments continued to lag the decline in market rates.2
Growth in small time deposits, at around an 8 percent annual rate, was
by far the slowest increase since the spring; unlike MMDA rates, offering
rates on small time deposits declined roughly in line with those on
market instruments during November.
The acceleration in M3 in November--to a 16 percent annual
rate of growth--primarily reflected expansion of its M2 component.
1. A review of 1984 developments in monetary and credit aggregates is
presented in Appendix A.
2. The lag in MMDA rates, which mirrored the earlier sluggishness on
the upside when market rates rose, was a pricing decision of depository
institutions. In the case of money funds, however, the lag in recorded
returns was simply a consequence of the way capital gains are reflected
under conventional accounting practices.

III-5
Growth of the non-M2 component, although remaining strong, "slowed" to
a 20 percent annual rate, down from the 29 percent pace in October. This
deceleration was entirely due to a drop in net large time deposits at
commercial banks. The needs of banks for managed liabilities were
lessened by the strength in core deposits and a large buildup in Treasury
balances. Thrift institutions, on the other hand, showed continued
reliance on large time deposits, which accelerated to about a 40 percent
annual rate of increase.
Other non-M2 components contributed to the growth of M3 last month.
Institution-only money market funds soared again--by $6 billion, up a bit
from the strong gain in October--reflecting favorable yield relationships.
Term RPs continued to expand, in keeping with the buildup of securities
in bank trading accounts, and term Eurodollars increased for the first
time since March.
Bank credit is estimated to have expanded at an 11-1/2 percent
annual rate in November, the largest monthly increase since May. Both
increased loan growth and a resumption of net securities acquisition
contributed to the faster growth. Consumer credit accounted for a good
bit of the step-up in loan growth; real estate loans grew just a shade
faster than in October and expansion in business loans slowed a little to
9-1/2 percent. Growth in business loans, adjusted to eliminate the
effects of merger-related financing, was a little under 8 percent last
month, or slightly less than in the third quarter and October.
Despite a sequence of cuts that moved the prime rate down from 12
to 11-1/4 percent at major banks, it remained well above market rates, and
prime-based bank loans generally remained less attractive than open market

paper. Paced by the rapid expansion of outstanding commercial paper, the
sum of business loans at domestic offices and foreign branches of U.S.
banks plus paper increased at more than a 17 percent annual rate, close
to the rapid rate of expansion in the first half of the year.
Business Finance
Although short-term market rates have posted the more sizable
declines over the past couple of months, bond yields led the rally
earlier and now are more than two percentage points below their 1984
highs. Corporations have responded to the rate decline with a record
volume of bond offerings, earmarked in some cases for repayment of
short-term debt and in others to meet needs for external funds. Both
financial and nonfinancial firms have sharply increased their bond
offerings, and the markets have been receptive to higher- and lower-rated
firms alike. Corporate bond offerings totaled $12.9 billion in November,
almost matching the volume of the preceding month; a backup in bond rates
most recently, as well as the normal year-end hiatus, likely will leave
December issuance lower, but still sizable.
The market rally has prompted some increase in the proportion of
bond offerings with maturities in the 20-year plus category, but many
firms still prefer intermediate-term financings. The Euromarket has been
especially attractive for such deals. Despite foreign investor concerns
that the repeal of the U.S. withholding tax could at some point be re-
versed, U.S. firms have been able to borrow abroad at favorable rates
by including in their issues indemnification clauses promising compensa-
tion for any potential drop in interest income due to reintroduction of
this tax.

Although stock prices have declined recently and generally have
remained below their 1984 highs, new equity issues have picked up this
fall. Nonfinancial firms sold about $1.3 billion during each of the past
two months, and financial firms likewise raised substantial amounts in
the equity markets. Even so, because of the redemption of outstanding
shares associated with merger activity, net equity issuance by nonfi-
nancial firms likely will again be negative in the fourth quarter.
Government Finance
Federal sector. The staff projects a combined deficit of $75
billion in the current quarter, of which about $6-1/2 billion reflects
the need to refund HUD project notes.1 Treasury financing during the
quarter is expected to include an $18 billion reduction in cash balances
and $61 billion net borrowing from the public. As usual, the majority of
new funds will be raised in auctions of marketable coupon issues, although
net bill financing could reach almost 30 percent of total new funds
raised in the quarter.
On November 28 the Treasury conducted its second $1 billion auction
of notes especially targeted to foreign investors. Dealer interest in
these securities, offered in conjunction with the domestic 5-year 2-month
notes, was not as keen as in the earlier targeted 4-year note offering.
1. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 removed the authority to issue
tax-exempt project notes from the 1937 Housing Act and placed it under
the Internal Revenue Code. Because of confusion surrounding the tax
status of the notes, HUD suspended their issuance and was forced to
borrow funds directly from the Treasury in order to fulfill its guarantee
behind the outstanding project notes. These transactions add to the size
of the deficit and alter the composition of government sector debt, by
transferring borrowing from local governments to the federal government.
Aside from this change, there is no direct effect on credit markets. If
the IRS rules that the project notes are tax-exempt, the transactions
will be unwound and the federal deficit total in a later period will be
reduced accordingly.

III-10
The average yield on the latest foreign offering was only 7 basis points
(on a comparable basis) below that on the companion domestic issue, where-
as the earlier auction produced a 32 basis point saving. In addition, in
early November, FNMA offered $300 million of 7-year debentures similar to
the foreign-targeted Treasury issues. FNMA estimates that its targeted
offering was sold at an average yield 18 basis points below what it would
have paid in the domestic market. (See section IV for further discussion
of targeted issues and related subjects.)
Borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies has eased in the
fourth quarter as the financing needs of the Federal Home Loan Bank
System have diminished. Financial Corporation of America's improved
funding situation and strong deposit growth at other S&Ls' have reduced
the need for advances. In contrast, FNMA has stepped up its borrowing
in the fourth quarter in anticipation of a bulge in its mortgage purchase
program that is partly seasonal and also partly a result of S&Ls' attempt-
ing to realize capital gains on their mortgage portfolios as long-term
rates decline.
State and local sector. Rates on long-term municipal securities
have come down significantly less from their 1984 highs than have yields
on taxable bonds, and the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields is now
at its highest level in about 18 months. This evidently is attributable
to the unusually heavy issuance of long-term municipal bonds in recent
months; in November, gross offerings totaled around $9.5 billion,
following a volume almost as large in October. Issuance in the first
half of the year averaged $5.8 billion per month. By contrast, offerings
of short-term municipals were sharply reduced in November, owing to the

absence of HUD project notes and a falloff in issuance of tax and revenue
anticipation notes.
In the long-term market, single-family housing bonds have
continued to boost issue volume since their reauthorization in June under
the Deficit Reduction Act. After soaring to more than $3 billion in July
and August, issuance has trended down to a still sizable $1.2 billion in
November. There also has been a rush to market industrial development
bonds because of impending volume restrictions on most IDBs. Other
issuers of IDBs may be coming to market before the end of the year in an
effort to avoid more severe arbitrage requirements that go into effect
January 1.1
1. Under the old law, the proceeds of capital improvement bonds could
be reinvested for a period of three years. After year-end, however, the
arbitrage period will be shortened to six months for all IDBs, except
multifamily housing bonds.

III-12
Short-term municipal markets also have been affected by a number
of new influences recently. As noted previously, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development has not sold project notes--which typically
have maturities between 3 and 13 months--since August. At the same
time, investors in short-term municipals may have shifted away from more
traditional instruments in this market towards variable-rate demand
bonds. These bonds technically are long-term, but their yields are
adjusted regularly to some index of shorter-term securities, and they
have the feature that they can be put sold back ("put") to the bond
trustee at prestated intervals, which typically correspond to the
interest rate adjustment period, ranging from a day to a quarter. One
estimate suggests that such bonds may total close to $14 billion this
year. Much of the reduction in supply of short-term tax-exempt securities
resulting from the cancellation of HUD project notes seems to have been
offset by the surge in "puttable" bonds. The increased supply of these
issues helps explain why yields on shorter-term tax and revenue antici-
pation notes, with 3- and 6-month maturities, have fallen only 25 to 35
basis points since early summer. Unable to buy HUD notes, investors have
not had to purchase these TANs and RANs for short-term placements, but
rather have been able to pick up the variable-rate bonds.
It is not clear whether uncertainties about tax reforms are having
a significant effect on the municipal bond market. One Treasury pro-
posal that might reduce the demand for tax-exempt bonds is a cut in the
top marginal tax rate. Other elements of the Treasury plan, including
the elimination of alternative tax shelters and restrictions on eligible
issuers of tax-exempt debt, might work in the opposite direction.

III-13
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates have dropped further since early November on
borrowing secured by home mortgages as well as on short-term
construction funds. In the primary market for permanent financing,
average contract interest rates on new commitments at S&Ls for
conventional fixed-rate home mortgages declined 65 basis points during
November; the decrease from the early August high has cumulated to
1-1/2 percentage points. The nominal interest rate on this dominant
type of fixed-rate mortgage instrument--averaging 13.2 percent during
the week ending December 7--was equal to its 1984 low, registered in
February.
On FHA-insured fixed-rate home mortgages, the effective yield
on new commitments at mortgage companies also has retreated. With price
discounts on GNMA-guaranteed securities issued against pools of FHA/VA
loans falling to minimal levels, the Administration cut the ceiling rate
on VA-guaranteed loans by 1/2 percentage point, effective November 21,
the second such action within a month. On VA-guaranteed loans bearing
the new 12-1/2 percent coupon rate applicable to level-payment mortgages,
discounts have recently averaged around 3 points.
At S&Ls, initial interest rates on conventional adjustable-rate
mortgages (ARMs) have declined during the past four weeks about as much
as average costs of fixed-rate credit. The average interest rate dif-
ferential favoring one-year ARMs over fixed-rate loans at these insti-
tutions thus has continued to exceed 200 basis points since early November.
At that time, ARMs were accounting for 61 percent of all conventional
home loans closed at major originators--down somewhat from the high in

early August, when the ARM initial interest rate differential was wider,
a larger share of ARMs was being discounted, and ARM credit and insurance
standards were less stringent.
Because of the recent cuts in the bank prime rate, credit costs have
declined on many new and outstanding residential construction loans. More
than two-thirds of construction and land development loan extensions by
insured commercial banks during the week of November 5 to 9 carried floating
rates, according to the latest quarterly survey of terms of bank lending.
Mortgage credit demand appears to be firming in response to lower
interest rates. During October, new commitments at S&Ls--which had de-
clined during each of the preceding four months--rose nearly 2 percent
to $14.6 billion, according to preliminary data for insured institutions.
With mortgage closings rising, commitments outstanding dipped further, to
about 4 percent below the June high.
New issues of federally guaranteed mortgage pass-through securi-
ties--typically backed by fixed-rate loans--climbed in October to more
than $6 billion, the largest volume in a year. Preliminary data show
somewhat less strength in November, owing to a sharp drop in new GNMA
issues.1 Issuance associated with mortgage swapping--usually with S&Ls
and banks--strengthened at FNMA and FHLMC in both months.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding rose at an estimated
16-3/4 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in October, the first
1. Of the three federally sponsored housing credit agencies, only FNMA
so far has issued large amounts of ARM pass-through securities. The GNMA
ARM pass-through security program has been slow in evolving; several
applications for GNMA guaranty have been filed, and a small amount of
securities was issued in November.

acceleration after four straight months of slowing growth. Commercial
bank data suggest further strength in November.
By early November, consumer interest rates at commercial banks
had turned down a bit from their August levels, but they remained
substantially above a year earlier. On new cars, the most common rate
on 48-month loans, 13.91 percent, was down 17 basis points from August
but still 45 basis points above the November 1983 rate. At finance
companies, by comparison, interest rates edged up a trifle to 15.18
percent in October--also well above the year-earlier levels. As a result,
rate relationships between banks and finance companies for this type of
credit have been returning to a more normal spread. In the 1970s bank
rates often were about 200 basis points below those at finance companies,
but from 1980 through mid-1983 they were generally higher, as auto finance
companies offered occasional interest rate rebate/reduction programs and
banks were scarcely competing in this area. Since mid-1983, however,
banks have been aggressively pushing auto loans and the earlier rate
relationship has been re-emerging. The most recent Federal Reserve
survey of senior loan officers, taken in November, showed banks again
reporting an increased willingness to make consumer loans.
There also has been a widening of spreads between various consumer
loan rates and market interest rates recently. Compared with the rate
on three-year Treasury notes, for example, new-car loans at banks
carried a 3 percentage point markup in November, larger than last spring
or a year earlier. Apparently, the recent widening of these spreads
is the result of a tendency toward a more normal relationship; over the
1972-83 period the average auto loan spread was 360 basis points.

APPENDIX A*
MONEY AND CREDIT GROWTH IN 1984
The monetary and credit aggregates have grown at substantially dis-
parate rates in 1984, with M1 and M2 increasing much less rapidly than M3
and domestic nonfinancial debt. Money and credit expansion occurred
against a backdrop of a very brisk increase in economic activity over the
first half of the year followed by a marked slowing, and rising money
market rates of interest through much of the spring and summer preceding
sharp declines. In addition, the surge in merger activity in 1984 boosted
debt growth and bank issuance of managed liabilities. Unlike 1983 and
some other recent years, there were no major deregulation measures and
thus distortions from this source likely diminished.
Ml and M2 through November have expanded within their target ranges
of 4 to 8 percent and 6 to 9 percent, respectively. Through the first
half of the year M1 was mostly in the upper half of its range, but growth
since June has been sluggish, leaving it at the lowest quartile.1 M2 has
generally been in the lower half of its range, with the November surge
pulling this measure near the midpoint. In contrast, M3 and debt have
run consistently above the upper ends of their ranges.
M1
The path of transactions balances has been influenced by swings in
output growth and interest rates over the year. The rapid growth of out-
put boosted M1 growth over the first half of the year, while the rise in
interest rates through mid-summer and the slowdown in economic activity
tended to damp expansion in this measure into the fall. Over the first
three quarters of the year, M1 demand was in line with predictions of
standard money demand models, but more recently it appears to be well
below model predictions. For the year as a whole, M1 velocity is likely
to rise about 4 percent.
The growth rates of the components of M1 have followed patterns
similar to the aggregate, weakening in the second half of the year. OCD
has continued to be the strongest component, but it has not dominated
overall M1 growth to the extent seen in 1982 or 1983. Growth of the
number of ATS/NOW accounts outside the Northeast slowed to an 8 percent
annual pace through the third quarter, consistent with the end of signifi-
cant net shifting into these accounts. The OCD component has increased
from 17 percent of M1 in December 1981 to 21 percent in December 1982,
and to 25 percent in December 1983, but its share has since risen only
slightly. Demand deposits expanded at about a 4 percent annual rate in
the first half of the year but, on balance, have declined a bit since June.
* Prepared by Paul O'Brien, Economist, Banking Section, Division of
Research and Statistics.
1. Concurrent seasonal adjustment using the X-11 ARIMA procedure suggests
that underlying growth may have been in the neighborhood of 1/2 percent-
age points slower in the first half of the year and 1/2 percentage point
faster in the second half, mainly in the fourth quarter.
III-A-1

III-A-2
M2
The growth of M2 was, until recently, much steadier. Its nontrans-
actions components grew at about a 7 percent annual rate in each of the
first three quarters of this year, but likely will expand more rapidly in
the fourth quarter. M2 velocity expanded briskly during the first half of
the year--at about a 5 percent annual rate--but it was roughly unchanged
in the third quarter. The sluggishness of M2 in the first half of the
year, despite higher growth in nominal income and credit, may have
reflected both the observed reluctance of depository institutions to
match rising market rates with comparably higher rates on retail deposits
and inflows to IRA/Keogh accounts, which are excluded from the monetary
aggregates. The rebound of M2 growth in the fourth quarter is in part
due to relatively more favorable yields on M2 deposits and money market
mutual funds as such yields have lagged market rate declines.
There have been substantial variations in growth of the various
nontransactions M2 components over the year, reflecting rate relation-
ships. Nontransactions M2 deposits were much weaker when bank and
thrift offering rates lagged market rate increases during the spring, but
they recovered when market rates declined more swiftly after mid-summer.
Another effect seems to stem from the slope of the bank deposit yield
curve. During the January through March period, the yield curve of com-
mercial bank offering rates was relatively flat, and commercial bank
MMDAs surged more than $14 billion while commercial bank small time
deposits--after adjustment for IRA/Keogh deposits--stagnated. Yet in
those months the bank rate-market rate gap favored longer-term deposits.
Between June and August, the yield curve of bank offering rates steepened
considerably, small time deposits rose rapidly, and MMDAs declined. At
that time, however, the gap between market rates and bank offering rates
was much greater for small time deposits than for MMDAs. Thrift institu-
tions have generally set a steeper yield curve with their offering rates,
stimulating relatively stronger growth of small time deposits and net
runoffs of MMDAs.
M3
The much more rapid expansion of M3--at a 10 percent annual rate
from the fourth quarter of 1983 through November--reflected very rapid
credit growth at depository institutions and heavy issuance of large
time deposits. Credit growth has been especially strong at thrift insti-
tutions and their issuance of large time deposits exceeded 30 percent at
an annual rate in nine of the first eleven months of the year. The
outstanding volume of thrift large time deposits declined in September,
owing to a runoff of large CDs at the troubled American Savings and Loan
subsidiary of the Financial Corporation of America, but resumed rapid
growth in October and November. In response to record levels of mortgage
lending in the spring and summer, thrift institutions supplemented core
deposit growth with other managed liabilities as well, particularly term
RPs and FHLB advances.

III-A-3
Commercial bank credit was especially strong in the first half of
the year, but issuance of large time deposits was primarily concentrated
in the March to July period. Bank CD issuance in the early part of the
year probably was restrained by borrowings from foreign offices. About
$15 billion was raised over the first five months; however, some of this
inflow was reversed shortly thereafter--the result of large advances by
Continental Illinois Bank to its foreign offices and an easing of borrow-
ings by other commercial banks. Bank credit growth tapered off after
June as did large time deposit growth. More recent fluctuations in bank
large CD issuance have stemmed to some extent from swings in Treasury
balances.
Institution-only money market mutual funds grew slowly through much
of the year, but have risen sharply in October and November as their divi-
dend rates declined less than money market rates. Term RPs have shown
a net increase of about $13 billion through November; about $9 billion
of this has been by thrift institutions. Term Eurodollars, which had
grown rapidly in recent years, were flat through May but then began to
decline. Rate premiums on Eurodollar deposits had dropped in late 1983,
and Continental-inspired concerns about the banking system may have
introduced doubts about the relative safety of offshore deposits.
Total Credit
Domestic nonfinancial sector debt has grown at a 13 percent annual
rate through October, keeping this aggregate consistently above its
monitoring range. While growth of nonfinancial debt has certainly been
supported by very heavy federal borrowing, many private debt components
also have shown significant strength. Business borrowing was boosted by
the wave of corporate mergers and acquisitions. Net retirement of corpo-
rate equities during 1984 has been about $70 billion. Allowance for this
amount would imply debt growth closer to the 11 percent upper end of its
monitoring range.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting, the trade-weighte value of the dollar
has rebounded by nearly 4-1/2 percent. It now stands only 1 percent
below its mid-October peak. The dollar's strength has been surprising in
light of economic developments in the intermeeting period. Incoming data
on U.S. economic activity have until very recently proven weaker than
most market participants expected, while reports on foreign activity have
perhaps been stronger than expected. Dollar interest rates have
registered some further decline relative to foreign rates.
The improvement in the U.S. trade balance in October appeared to
provide some support to the dollar. In addition, market commentary on
the dollar's rise noted an emerging belief that dollar interest rates may
have bottomed out and might be headed upward. This view is consistent
with the recent steepening of the Treasury yield curve. Furthermore,
market participants expressed the expectation that foreign interest rates
would come down if dollar interest rates maintained or extended their
declines.
Interest rates in Canada and in most European markets did ease
somewhat during the intermeeting period. Central bank actions included
three cuts totalling 1 percent in the Bank of England's money-market
dealing rates. Around mid-November, the Bundesbank provided liquidity to
the German market at a reduced rate of interest in what was perceived in
the market as a tentative move toward ease. However, an easing came into
doubt as the mark continued to weaken and as the Bundesbank's next
domestic operation proved less generous than the market expected,

whereupon German domestic short-term interest rates retraced a portion of
their earlier declines.
Italian money-market interest rates did not move lower until late
in the intermeeting period and did so then without an active push from
the Bank of Italy. The Bank's discount rate remains at the higher level
established early in September. Comparatively firm interest rates,
favorable inflation news, strong third-quarter growth, and ongoing
economic reform likely account for the lira's gains of about 1-1/2
percent vis-a-vis the other EMS currencies over the intermeeting period.

U.S. banks' foreign lending in the third quarter. Gross claims of
U.S.-chartered banks on foreigners declined by nearly $22 billion (five
percent) between end-June and end-September. It appears that as much as
about $9 billion of the decrease my have reflected the effect of the
appreciation of the dollar during the quarter (more than eight percent
on a weighted average basis) on the $110 billion end-June stock of
nondollar-denominated claims at foreign branches. The overall decline
in claims can be ascribed largely to U.S. banks' desire to improve
capital/assets ratios. Three-fourths of the total decrease was in
claims on G-10 countries and offshore banking centers, principally
interbank placements. Reductions in claims on other areas were
relatively small; claims on non-OPEC developing countries fell $1.9
billion.
Large declines in total claims on foreigners were recorded at
both the U.S. offices and the foreign branches. Claims on banks
(excluding intrabank claims) held by the foreign branches were drawn
down by nearly $7 billion, while foreign branch claims on nonbank
foreigners fell another $7 billion; at the U.S. offices the decline
in foreign claims was largely in the interbank area.
The $1.9 billion drop in claims on non-OPEC developing countries
can be fully accounted for by reductions in claims on Korea, Taiwan and
the Philippines. Claims on Latin America as a whole were little changed.
Claims on Brazil rose $0.9 billion, more than can be accounted for by
the U.S. banks' share (about $0.3 billion) of Brazil's September drawing
of $875 million on the bank term loan signed in February. Claims on
Mexico decreased $0.6 billion even though they tended to be increased by
the U.S. banks' share (about $350 million) of Mexico's September drawing

of $950 million on the bank term loan signed in April. The fall in
claims on Mexico may have resulted from repayments or bank write-offs of
debts of private Mexican borrowers. Of the $1.8 billion decrease in

IV- 7
U.S. Capital Accounts
Since late October, four issues of U.S. government or agency
foreign-targeted notes (FTNs) have been introduced into the Eurobond
market -- two $1 billion auctions by the U.S. Treasury, a $300 million
issue by FNMA and a $200 million issue by FHLB. The annualized rate
differential between the U.S. Treasury FTN and the companion domestic
bond was 32 basis points in the first issue, but only 7 basis points in
the second issue. For the FNMA and FHLB issues there are no domestic
companion issues from which to calculate interest savings.
The FTNs are designed to tap the Euromarket funding source by
preserving anonymity for foreign investors while making the bond
unattractive to U.S. tax evaders via the certification requirement.
However, unlike standard Eurobonds, the FTNs are not true bearer
instruments, nor do they indemnify the bond holder against changes in
U.S. tax law. A greater market appreciation of these negative
characteristics may explain the smaller rate differential and the lower
degree of oversubscription distinguishing the second foreign-targeted
Treasury auction. Part of the explanation however may reflect timing;
evidence from the corporate bond market suggests that the degree to which
Euromarket financing is advantageous varies over time with changes in
the LIBOR-Treasury bill spread and with the changes in exchange rate
expectations that can influence the relative value of annual versus
semi-annual coupons. The Treasury's simultaneous auction of domestic and
foreign-targeted notes that is decided well in advance prevents the
Treasury from taking advantage of such timing windows. In addition the
Euromarket's increased familiarity with the Treasury yield-auction

IV- 8
technique probably reduced the skew in the distribution of accepted bids,
thus lowering the average spread over the interest rate on the domestic
bonds.
Guidance from the corporate bond market on where rate differentials
between domestic and Euro-Treasuries are likely to equilibrate over time
is limited by the narrowing range of comparable domestic and Euromarket
instruments and by the falling percentage of corporate Euromarket
instruments that are conventional fixed-rate bonds. From September to
November, the percentage of fixed-rate issues (by value) in the Eurobond
market fell from 45 to 6 percent, compared with a November figure of 47
percent for the domestic market. U.S. firms increasingly issue Eurobonds
with novel features designed to exploit the foreign currency and interest
rate preferences of Euromarket participants.
Among these new instruments are Savings and Loan collateralized
Eurobonds. This debt has been issued in two distinct phases
distinguished by the characteristics of the instruments and corresponding
to changes in the regulatory environment. The U.S. Treasury caused the
hiatus when, in advance of its own auction of foreign-targeted notes, it
disallowed the bearer form for instruments collateralized by U.S.
government securities or agency obligations. Prior to that August
ruling, the Netherlands Antilles affiliates of six S&Ls and one state
agency raised $875 million via fixed-rate, bearer, tax-indemnified notes
collateralized by mortgages guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC or by U.S.
Treasury bonds. Since August, S&L issues in the Euromarket comprise
three types of foreign-targeted notes (a fixed-rate bond, a zero-coupon

IV-9
bond, and a floating-rate note) all with tax indemnification and
collateralized by U.S. securities or GNMA, FNMA, or FHLMC obligations; in
addition, a bearer, fixed-rate, tax-indemnified instrument was issued
with a collateral pool of mortgage bonds, CDs, BAs, and cash. The volume
of debt since August totals $475 million, bringing outstanding
collateralized S&L Eurodebt to $1.4 billion as of November.
Apparently the institutional investor, predominant in the floating
rate market, is attracted by the collateral and the quasi U.S. government
guarantee and is not dissuaded by the foreign-targeted (as opposed to
bearer) form of the instrument. S&Ls therefore find it cheaper to raise
long-term funds by issuing LIBOR based floating-rate obligations in the
Euromarket and using interest rate swap contracts to hedge against both
the maturity risk and the rate risk associated with the mismatching of
the term structure and interest rate basis of their assets and
liabilities.
Another development in the Eurobond market is the increased use of
floating rate notes (FRNs) for bank funding -- $3.5 billion in the five
months July through November compared with $0.4 billion in the first six
months of 1984; bank Euronotes issued in 1984 total $7.9 billion. Over
50 percent of the FRN proceeds raised by banks or bank holding companies
is in the form of bank equity commitment notes or equity contract notes.
Both instruments augment banking organizations' primary capital
under current Federal Reserve and Comptroller capital guidelines,
although there is a maximum percent of primary capital that can be held
in this form.
The first non-dollar bond issue has just been introduced into the
U.S. domestic financial market. (The U.S. Treasury, in a 1982 statement,

IV-10
opened the domestic market to foreign currency issues.) The European
Economic Community floated the fixed rate, 12 year, 200 million ECU
bond. While the ECU is well established in the Eurobond market, the
recent Euromarket funding of ECU-denominated loans and the successful
issue in the U.S. domestic market signals both a wider acceptance of the
ECU and a demand by investors for registered foreign currency issues.
The Summary Table on U.S. International Transactions shows that
U.S. banking offices reported a $14 billion net capital inflow in the
third quarter vis-a-vis unaffiliated foreigners in contrast to a $2
billion net outflow in the second quarter (line 1b). The bulk of the
inflow ($12 billion) represents a reduction in net claims on unaffiliated
foreign banks in significant part by U.S.-chartered banks. The
Euro-interbank deposit rundown was associated with a narrowing of the
interest differential favoring Euromarket deposits over Treasury bills.
As shown in the International Banking Data Table, net inflows have
also been occurring through reductions in U.S. non-bank holdings of
Eurodollar deposits (line 5) which fell $4.8 billion further in October
to a level of $115.2 billion. Heightened concerns about bank failures,
along with oil-merger financing and cash management, account for some of
the downward trend in these deposits. However, notably in contrast to
the net inflows induced by the relative strength of economic activity and
credit demands in the United States, some of the reduction in non-bank
holdings of Eurodollars appears to reflect deposit withdrawal by sectors
of the U.S. economy facing relatively weak product demand, in
particular the oil and gas extraction, primary metals, and non-electric
machinery industries.

IV-11
September data show net private foreign sales of U.S. Treasury
obligations of $3.4 billion. (See the Summary Table, line 3.) Active
World Bank portfolio managers sold $3.2 billion of U.S. Treasury bills,
accounting for the bulk of the amount. The September data contrast
sharply with large August net purchases associated with bearer Euro-CATS
(since disallowed by the Treasury regulations on bearer instruments).
Foreign official reserve holdings in the United States (line 4)
declined by $3.8 billion in September. Substantial outflows from the
accounts of Germany, the Netherlands, and OPEC outweighed net inflows for
Italy. Official dollar sales by the Bundesbank, combined with the oil
glut's effect on OPEC holdings help explain the September data. Over the
third quarter as a whole, net foreign official reserve holdings in the
United States were essentially unchanged. Preliminary data for October
covering official holdings at the FRBNY show an increase of $2.2 billion,
primarily in OPEC RPs.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In October, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was substantially
less than in September and considerably smaller than the deficit for the
third quarter as a whole, largely because of a reduction in imports.
Imports in October dropped back to a level well below the average
for the third quarter. There were declines from third-quarter levels in
a wide range of machinery items and industrial supplies (including
steel). Decreases were also recorded for new passenger cars from Japan,
consumer goods (especially clothing and footwear) and agricultural
imports. Nonetheless, the level of imports in October was still
substantially higher than recorded a year ago, reflecting the strong
expansion of economic activity in the United States and the continued
appreciation of the dollar.

The only major category of imports that did not decline in October
from its third-quarter level was oil. The volume imported was marginally
higher than the average rates for both the second and third quarters;
domestic consumption of crude oil has increased steadily during the year,
and inventories, after being drawn down in the third quarter, were
boosted a little in October. While the average price of oil imports in
October was about the same as in September, the price was about 25 cents
per barrel less than in the third quarter. After firming in September
and early October, spot market prices dropped sharply in mid-October,
primarily for light crude oil; during November and early December, part
of the decline was reversed.

Exports in October were close to the average for the third quarter
as a whole. An increase in machinery exports in October from
third-quarter levels was offset by declines in exports of passenger cars
to Canada, aircraft, industrial supplies (especially coal) and
agricultural commodities. For the entire July-October period, the volume
of nonagricultural exports expanded to a rate that was 5 percent higher
than that recorded in the first half of the year; this increase largely
reflected a gradual strengthening of economic activity in major
trading partners.

IV-16
The volume of agricultural exports in the July-October period
continued to be influenced by strong shipments of wheat and feedgrains to
the USSR, which had a very poor grain harvest. However, demand for U.S.
products from the rest of the world remained weak, as many foreign buyers
awaited the results of their own harvests (which turned out to be very
good) and as the high value of the dollar continued to make it difficult
for U.S. agricultural producers to remain price-competitive with foreign
producers.

IV-17
Foreign Economic Developments. Economic expansion in the major
foreign industrial countries has been continuing at a moderate, though
uneven, pace. Real activity in Germany has recovered strongly
following the strike-related slump of the summer, with real GNP growing
by just over 10 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter. Part of the
increase in third quarter Canadian real GNP growth, to nearly 8 percent
(s.a.a.r.), reflected a temporary increase in production in advance of
the September and October auto strikes. In both France and Italy real
GDP growth in the third quarter increased to about 4 percent (s.a.a.r.)
while the pace of real GNP growth in Japan slowed to 3 percent
(s.a.a.r.). Activity in the United Kingdom has continued to be
depressed by the coal strike, with real activity virtually flat in the
third quarter. Unemployment rates have on balance held steady in
recent months, remaining at or near record-high levels in Europe.
There continues to be no indication that expansion abroad has led
to a rekindling of inflationary pressures. Indeed, inflation rates in
recent months have either remained steady at low levels (in Japan and
Germany) or shown further declines (in Italy, France and Canada).
Japan's cumulative current account surplus through October
increased to $32 billion (s.a.a.r.), well above the record-high rate of
last year. France's external deficits have continued to decrease while
those of the United Kingdom have expanded in recent months, reflecting
in large part the impact of the coal strike.
Individual Country Notes. Real GNP growth in Japan slowed to 3
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter from an upward revised 7.6
percent increase in the second quarter. Plant and equipment spending

continued its rapid advance, rising by almost 10 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
the third quarter. The rate of growth of private consumption rose to 3
percent, double the rate in the second quarter. However, the rate of
growth of exports decelerated sharply, falling to 7 percent after a 21
percent rate of increase in the second quarter. Import growth surged
to a 31 percent rate, compared with an 11 percent rate of advance in
the second quarter, in part as a result of accelerated petroleum
purchases ahead of a September increase in the tax on petroleum. Thus
net exports made their first negative contribution to GNP since late
1981. Other indicators point to a continued healthy expansion.
Industrial production jumped in October by 2.9 percent (s.a.) after a
revised 1 percent drop in September. New construction orders in the
third quarter rose by more than 18 percent (s.a.) on the strength of
overseas and private domestic orders.
Wholesale price inflation remains close to zero. Most of the
pickup of consumer price inflation in September and October reflects
seasonal influences; consumer prices in October were 2.2 percent above
their year-earlier level.
The cumulative trade surplus in the first ten months of this year
was $42 billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with a surplus in the same period
last year of $31 billion. This increase is reflected in a higher
current account surplus, which rose from $21 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the
first ten months of 1983 to $32 billion through October of this year.
The draft budget for FY 1985 (beginning April 1) is scheduled to
be submitted to the cabinet on December 24. The outline of the budget
calls for a 4 percent increase in both general account spending and in

IV-22
total revenue. The Finance Ministry has also concluded its outline of
the Fiscal Loan and Investment Program; total outlays under this
program in FY 1985 are slated to be unchanged in nominal terms from
this fiscal year.
The Euroyen CD market was launched December 1 as expected. The
maturity of Euroyen CD's is restricted to six months or less, and they
may not be sold to Japanese residents.
Satoshi Sumita, the current Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan,
has been selected by the Prime Minister to be the Bank's new Governor.
Following expected cabinet approval, Sumita will replace Governor
Mayekawa, who is retiring, on December 16.
Industrial production in Germany increased by 2.3 percent (s.a.)
in October after having retreated somewhat in August and September from
the relatively high level associated with the rebound from the early
summer metal workers' strike. The October level of industrial
production was 4 percent above its year-earlier value. Real GNP growth
in the third quarter was 10.3 percent (s.a.a.r.), also reflecting the
rebound from the strike. This put third-quarter GNP about 3 percent
above its level a year ago. Surveys on the business climate and data
on order volumes suggest continuing strength, particularly in the
export sector. The rate of unemployment, however, has remained
unchanged at 9.2 percent (s.a.) through November.
The monthly rate of consumer price inflation was 0.1 percent
(n.s.a.) in November after very low monthly advances during the
preceding months. The November consumer price index was 2 percent
above its level of November last year. There has, however, been a

IV-23
pickup in the pace of wholesale price inflation, particularly for
imported goods, partly caused by the strength of the U.S. dollar.
The cumulative current account through October was in surplus by
about $2 billion (n.s.a.), little different than in the same period
last year.
Industrial production in the United Kingdom declined slightly in
the third quarter and was 1.7 percent below its year-earlier level.
The output measure of real GDP increased by only 0.8 percent (s.a.a.r.)
in the third quarter. This weakness is in part the result of the
ongoing coal miners' strike, now in its ninth month. To date, the
effect of the strike on coal-using industries has been limited although
coal production has been substantially reduced. The U.K. unemployment
rate was 12.9 percent (s.a.) in November, the same as in the previous
two months. The year-over-year increase in the retail price index was
5 percent in October, similar to that at the beginning of the year.
The U.K. trade deficit exceeded $12 billion (s.a.a.r.) in both
September and October reflecting, in part, increased oil imports
as a consequence of the coal strike and the front-loading of imports
prior to the November 1 change in VAT procedures which advanced the
collection of VAT on imports from time of sale to time of import. The
cumulative current account deficit has widened to $1.5 billion
(s.a.a.r.) for the first ten months of 1984, compared with a $4.4
billion surplus for all of 1983.
The Bank of England lowered all four of its money-market dealing
rates by 1 percentage point in three steps in November, the last cut
taking place one day after the Federal Reserve Board announced a

IV-24
lowering of the discount rate. The shortest-term dealing rate is now
9-1/2 percent. A general outline of the government's 1985/86 budget
was provided by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson in his Autumn
Statement to Parliament on November 12. Real public expenditures are
scheduled to be held constant and a net tax cut equivalent to 0.4
percent of GDP is envisioned. Reductions in the contingency reserve
and increased asset sales (which count as negative expenditure) allow
for a small increase in actual real expenditures despite the stated
target of zero percent real growth. The Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement is forecast to fall to 2 percent of GDP (from 2-1/2 percent
in 1984/85).
On December 11 the London clearing house announced that Citibank
is to become the first overseas bank to receive settlement privileges
in the U.K. clearing house system. Citibank is expected to participate
in both the same day clearing of high value checks (town clearing) and
in the bulk electronic clearing system (CHAPS).
Economic activity in France has remained weak in recent months.
Industrial production in September fell by 3.7 percent (s.a.), almost
entirely reversing a 4.6 percent rise recorded for the July-August
period which seems to have reflected an abnormal seasonal production
pattern over the summer holiday period. On a year-over-year basis,
September's industrial production figure showed an increase of only 1.6
percent. Real GDP in the third quarter rose by 4 percent (s.a.a.r.),
following a 2 percent decline in the second quarter. Third-quarter
real GDP was only 2 percent above its year-earlier level. The
unemployment rate in October remained at the record-high level of 10.1

IV-25
percent (s.a.) for the third consecutive month.
Consumer prices in October increased by 0.7 percent (n.s.a.) as
the year-over-year inflation rate eased slightly further to 7 percent.
The government has officially admitted that its original consumer price
inflation target for 1984 of 5 percent (December-over-December) will
not be achieved. A new target for 1985 of 4-1/2 percent has been
announced.
The current account was in surplus by $740 million (s.a.) in the
third quarter. For the first three quarters of this year, the current
account was in deficit by only $800 million (s.a.a.r.), a sharp
reduction from the $4.5 billion current account deficit rate recorded
in the same period last year. Comparing the same periods, the trade
deficit was reduced to $2.2 billion (s.a.a.r.) this year from $5.7
billion last year.
On November 14 it was announced that Michel Camdessus was
replacing Renaud de la Geniere as governor of the Bank of France. Mr.
Camdessus had been first deputy governor of the Bank since August and
before that had headed the treasury department at the Ministry of
Finance.
The recovery in Italy appears to be continuing. Real GDP
increased by 4.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter. Industrial
production increased by 1.1 percent (s.a.) in September. For the third
quarter as a whole, industrial production was 1.9 percent above its
level in the previous quarter and showed a year-over-year increase of
4 percent. At the end of November, the year-over-year rate of consumer
price inflation in Italy was down to 8.5 percent. The recent

IV-26
unexpectedly rapid progress in lowering the rate of growth of consumer
prices suggests that the government may achieve its goal of attaining a
7 percent rate of inflation in 1985.
The trade deficit in September declined slightly to $610 million
(s.a.). For the first nine months of 1984, the cumulative trade
deficit was $9.5 billion (s.a.a.r.), somewhat greater than the $8.6
billion deficit rate in the same period last year.
Finance Minister Visentini has proposed a tax reform package,
designed to make tax evasion by the self-employed more difficult, which
would raise tax collections by an amount equivalent to approximately 13
percent of this year's projected budget deficit. On November 30, the
government announced a reduction in the non-interest bearing deposit
requirement on Italians' direct foreign investments from 50 to 40
percent for investments outside the European Community and to 30
percent for investments within the Community.
Economic expansion picked up in Canada in the third quarter with
real GNP increasing by 7.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) mostly due to an increase
in net exports. Private fixed investment increased slightly, but
remained well below previous peaks. Both consumption and inventory
investment were about unchanged. About half of the third-quarter
increase in net exports appears to have been related to an increase in
auto production in anticipation of the September and October strikes.
Industrial production declined by 1.9 percent (s.a.) in September and
its year-over-year rate of increase fell to 5.2 percent. The
unemployment rate was unchanged in October at 11.3 percent (s.a.) after
a drop of 0.5 of a percentage point in September which reversed most of

IV-27
the rise in unemployment in August. Inflation has continued to
moderate. In October, the consumer price index was 3.4 percent above
its year-earlier level, the lowest inflation rate since the summer of
1971.
The trade surplus increased to $1.7 billion (s.a.) in October.
This brought the cumulative trade surplus so far this year to more than
$16 billion (s.a.a.r.), about $2 billion higher than the surplus rate
in the same period last year. The current account was in surplus by
$520 million (s.a.) in the third quarter. For the first three quarters
of this year, the current account surplus of $1.8 billion (s.a.a.r.)
was somewhat below the $2.2 billion surplus rate in the comparable
period last year.
Although the budget for 1985/86 will not be submitted until April
1985, there are strong indications that Canada, under its recently
elected Conservative government, is heading for a period of fiscal
austerity. On November 5, Brian Mulroney, Canada's new Prime Minister,
delivered a speech to Parliament calling for fiscal austerity,
deregulation, and new incentives to increase investment and to improve
productivity and international competitiveness. On November 8, Finance
Minister Michael Wilson provided some details regarding proposed budget
cuts. These cuts, along with other new initiatives, are expected to
reduce next fiscal year's budget deficit to 7.8 percent of GNP,
compared with a previously estimated deficit of 8.3 percent of GNP. No
tax increases were outlined, although tax reform was proposed. On
December 7 the government introduced a bill in Parliament which would
substantially reduce restrictions on foreign investment in Canada.

Debt Situation in Selected Developing Countries
Argentina and its bank advisory committee reached an agreement on
December 2 under which Argentina will receive $4.2 billion in new
credits in 1985 and a multi-year debt restructuring of a reported $13.4
billion in public and private sector debts now in arrears as to princi-
pal and debts maturing in 1985. In return, Argentina will pay at least
$750 million to reduce public sector interest arrears to the banks
before the end of 1984 and eliminate both public and private sector
interest arrears by June 30, 1985. Argentina has also agreed to repay
during the first quarter of 1985 the long-overdue $750 million balance
of the 1982 bridge loan. The agreement must now be approved by an
estimated 320 participating banks. The IMF Executive Board will con-
sider a 15-month, SDR 1.42 billion standby agreement and an SDR 275
million compensatory financing facility drawing for Argentina on
December 28, assuming the IMF receives assurances that a "critical mass"
(85 percent) of the bank financing is available. The U.S. Treasury has
said that it would provide a $500 million bridge loan when the bulk of
the bank lenders agree to participate in the financing. The U.S. Trea-
sury will be repaid from the first IMF disbursements. Argentine infla-
tion (measured by the CPI) abated somewhat in October to 19 percent and
further in November to 15 percent. The November rate was the lowest
monthly rate since last January, but prices were still 675 percent
higher than a year earlier. The peso price of the dollar rose substan-
tially faster than domestic prices in October and November. Since the
end of 1982, it has risen by about 13 percent less than the CPI. Two
months ago, this discrepancy was about twice as large.

IV-29
The rate of crawl of the Mexican peso was raised from 13 to 17 cen-
tavos per day, effective December 6. This is the first change in the
rate of crawl since the crawl was adopted in December 1982. On December
5, the controlled peso price of the dollar was 34 percent higher than a
year earlier, but the Mexican CPI in December is expected to be about 60
percent higher. As a result, the undervaluation of the peso that
remained at the beginning of 1984 has been virtually eliminated. If the
new rate of crawl is maintained until the end of 1985, the resulting
depreciation of the peso will be about the same in percentage terms as
that recorded this year and the controlled peso price of the dollar will
be some 30 percent higher than in December 1984. Price inflation,
however, may well exceed 40 percent next year. The budget submitted to
the Mexican Congress late last month calls for a public sector deficit
of 5.1 percent of GDP in 1985. The IMF, in negotiations over its EFF
program for 1985, reportedly is pressing for a smaller fiscal deficit
and significant steps toward relaxing trade restrictions. The 1984
public sector deficit is expected to exceed its target, partly because
inflation did not abate as much as anticipated, causing spending and, to
a lesser extent, receipts to exceed original plans. In particular, the
stubborn inflation led the Bank of Mexico to keep interest rates higher
than originally expected, causing interest payments on the internal
public debt to exceed original projections. The 1984 fiscal deficit was
also swollen by the decision to spend a contingency reserve earmarked to
stimulate economic activity if it did not show signs of recovering by
mid-year. Signs of an upturn began to appear in the second half,
prompting Finance Secretary Silva-Herzog to tell the Mexican Congress in

IV-30
October that he expected real GDP growth of 2-3 percent this year.
(Earlier forecasts had been for only 1 percent real growth in 1984.)
Real GDP growth of 3-4 percent is forecast for 1985.
Colombia is continuing to lose reserves. Between the end of 1983
and the end of November 1984, foreign exchange reserves declined by
about $1.1 billion and gold holdings were reduced by 2.45 million ounces
(equivalent to about $800 million at current prices). Much of the
remaining foreign exchange reserves is not in liquid form and the
remaining gold holdings (1.78 million ounces on November 30, equivalent
to about $585 million at current prices) probably will not last through
the first half of 1985, if reserves continue to decline at the rate
experienced in 1984. The authorities would like to obtain foreign
commercial bank financing, but the banks are likely to insist that
Colombia negotiate a formal stand-by arrangement with the IMF. The
Colombian authorities are hoping to avoid the policy constraints of an
IMF-approved program and would prefer to work instead with the World
Bank. Colombia has initiated, but not yet fully implemented, policy
adjustments such as the IMF might recommend. However, the IMF staff
does not consider these steps to be of sufficient magnitude. The
financial difficulties of the country's commercial banks have compli-
cated Colombia's external funding problems. In November, agreement in
principle was announced on the refinancing of $530-$550 million in
short-term external debts owed to banks by the Banco de Colombia, the
country's largest commercial bank. While this potentially removes an
important obstacle to foreign bank lending to the government, one or two
other commerical banks in Colombia are reported to be in difficulties,
and their problems have yet to be addressed.

IV-31
Brazil registered a trade surplus of almost $12 billion during the
first eleven months of the year, compared with a surplus of about $6
billion in the same period last year. The current account in 1984 is
now expected to either be in balance or register a small deficit,
perhaps $500 million (excluding $700 million of re-invested profits),
substantially below the projection of $5.3 billion made by the IMF at
the end of 1983. The general price index increased by over 12 percent
in October, but increased at a 9.9 percent rate in November, slightly
less than the average monthly rate of a little over 10 percent through
the first 10 months of the year. Economic activity has shown continued
signs of strength and real GDP is expected to grow by 3 percent this
year. Negotiations with creditor banks on a possible multi-year
rescheduling are expected to continue in mid-December after the IMF and
Brazil have agreed on 1985 performance criteria under the current EFF.
Brazil is not expected to need new money from banks in 1985, in part
because its cash reserves at the end of this year are now expected to be
approximately $9 billion.
Venezuela's bank advisory committee has continued to express
concern about the lack of progress in the payment of private sector
interest arrears, which now are estimated to exceed $1 billion. Sub-
stantial progress in the registration of this debt and the reduction of
the interest arrears is necessary for the country's multi-year debt
rescheduling agreement--negotiated in September--to be put in a form
that can be circulated to banks. Recently some changes have been made
in the registration procedures, but it is not clear how much of a
contribution these changes will make. Real GDP is expected to show

IV-32
slightly negative growth again this year. At the same time, the infla-
tion rate has increased (to about 16 percent in the 12 months through
October), although the lifting of some price controls in September has
distorted these figures somewhat. The public sector deficit, which was
4.7 percent of GDP in 1983, is expected to show a surplus of 4-5 percent
of GDP this year. Venezuela's 1984 current account surplus is expected
to be about $3 billion, not much different from the surplus registered
in 1983.
On November 23, Chile announced that its bank creditors will allow
the country to postpone until the end of June 1985 $2.2 billion in prin-
cipal payments coming due by the end of the year and during the first
quarter of next year. The postponement will give Chile time to imple-
ment a new IMF program--not expected to be agreed upon until March or
April--and negotiate a debt rescheduling agreement with the banks.
Chile is expected to ask for about $1 billion in new money for next year
but is likely to receive less than that, perhaps $800 million.
In Peru, there has been no movement toward a resolution of the
country's fiscal problems, which are the major obstacle to reaching
agreement with the IMF. Mounting arrears are also straining Peru's
relations with banks. Peru's central bank has continued to refuse to
release foreign exchange reserves, which as of September totaled $1.5
billion (excluding gold), to the government except in exchange for an
equivalent amount of domestic currency. Thus, the government's fiscal
problems have continued to contribute to the accumulation of external
arrears. There are indications that the government is contemplating
changes in economic policy that would help its relations with the IMF.

IV-33
The government is also discussing with its bank advisory committee
possible arrangements to bring interest payments current.
On November 2, the IMF Managing Director approved and sent to the
Board an 18-month, SDR 615 million stand-by arrangement for the Philip-
pines. The Board is currently scheduled to consider the proposal on
December 14. Consideration as scheduled will depend largely on whether
the Philippine authorities will have arranged pledges for about 90 per-
cent of the $925 million in new money needed from the commercial banks
in 1985. On November 7, the United States, Japan, and Korea provided
$80 million in bridge financing for the Philippines until the country
can draw on the stand-by arrangement. This credit was to have expired
on November 30, but was extended by the three countries until December
28--the date when the IMF is expected to disburse funds to the Philip-
pines. Philippine officials on December 17 will meet with the Paris
Club to reschedule debt owed to official lenders.
Yugoslavia's bank advisory committee reportedly has offered the
country a four-year serial debt restructuring for 1985-88 involving the
setting in advance of terms and conditions. Each year's restructuring
will be activated if the country complies with certain specified condi-
tions, including successful negotiation of a parallel arrangement with
official creditors. Yugoslavia is to arrange for another IMF stand-by
for 1985; in subsequent years relations with the IMF will be determined
by monitoring through the Article IV consultation process. The banks
have granted Yugoslavia a 90-day extension of principal payments due in
the first quarter of next year in order to allow time to work on the
details of the restructuring arrangement. The next meeting between
Yugoslavia and the banks is scheduled for January 7.
