The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Activity strengthened at the end of last year, and the economy
entered 1985 with renewed momentum. Production gains were widespread in
December, after inventory imbalances apparently were substantially reduced
earlier in the quarter, and preliminary estimates suggest factory output
continued to grow relatively strongly in January. Consumer spending increased
in the fourth quarter, bolstered by good gains in income and pre-Christmas
price discounting. Business investment spending was strong, although less
robust than in earlier year. Employment registered sizable increases
during the fourth quarter and again in January, while both wage and price
inflation remained moderate.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production increased 0.6 percent in December, and thus
made up all of its September-October decline. The December rise was broadly
based, in contrast to the 0.4 percent November increase, which was concentrated
in the automotive category. The output of consumer goods rose 0.6 percent,
while production of business equipment was up 0.7 percent. Automobile
assemblies increased to an 8.1 million unit annual rate in December and
rose to an 8-3/4 million unit rate in January. Capacity utilization for
total industry increased to 81.9 percent in December, but remained below
its level of last summer.
Preliminary data indicate that industrial production increased
around 1/2 percent in January, with particularly large gains in the motor
vehicle, steel, and electric utility industries.

Employment and Unemployment
Labor demand strengthened in the fourth quarter and continued to
increase in January, as nonfarm payroll employment rose a substantial
350,000. The largest gain last month took place at retail trade establish-
ments, but employment growth also was strong in services and construction,
where unseasonably mild weather boosted hiring in both December and early
January. Employment growth was considerably more moderate in manufacturing
industries, which added 23,000 workers to payrolls in January, after a
large increase in December. Gains were concentrated in the automobile and
electrical equipment industries. The manufacturing workweek edged down
to 40.6 hours in January, but remained above its fourth-quarter average.
Despite the continued rise in labor demand, the civilian unemployment
rate edged up to 7.4 percent in January. Much of the increase occurred
among adult women, whose jobless rate rose to 6.1 percent from 5.8 percent
in the fourth quarter; the unemployment rate for adult men was essentially
unchanged.
Personal Income and Consumption
Reflecting the continued gains in employment, income growth remained
strong in the fourth quarter. Personal income rose $16.4 billion in December,
about the same as the October-November average monthly increase. Wage and
salary disbursements jumped $18 billion, while there was only a small increase
in interest income, and a $5 billion decline in transfer payments associated
with a change in the payment date of military retirement benefits.
Real personal consumption expenditures rose 4 percent in the fourth
quarter, after little change in the third quarter. Real spending picked
up during the Christmas season, reflecting in part widespread price discounting.

Outlays for discretionary items such as general merchandise, apparel, and
furniture and appliances (GAF) increased strongly, while spending for
services was relatively weak, apparently because unseasonably warm weather
in December lowered electricity and natural gas consumption.
The strong demand for new cars continues to be an important factor
supporting consumer spending. Sales of domestic autos rose sharply in the
December-January period--averaging at an 8.5 million unit annual rate-1
million units above the strike-depressed levels of the preceding two months.
Sales of imported cars have remained strong at a 2.8 million unit pace.
Survey readings of consumer confidence fell in December but remained
high by historical standards. The decline in the Michigan Survey reflected
a more pessimistic outlook for the economy over the next five years.
The drop in the Conference Board index, however, was reversed in the more
recent survey taken in January. Compared with earlier in the recovery,
fewer households in both surveys expressed plans to purchase homes, automobiles,
and major appliances, but on balance, the responses were still quite favorable.
Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment continued to grow briskly in the fourth
quarter, although at a slower pace than in the first three quarters of 1984.
For equipment, shipments of nondefense capital goods rose 0.7 percent in
December and 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter as a whole. However, the
growth was spread unevenly across different types of equipment. Shipments
of computing and other high-technology electronic equipment increased 5.7
percent, while shipments of heavy industrial machinery were flat. Spending
on nonresidential construction increased substantially in the fourth quarter

with a particularly rapid rise in commercial and industrial buildings; some
weakness, however, was evident in the public utility and institutional sectors.
Near-term commitments for future spending have been mixed. After
little growth in the third quarter, the value of contracts and permits for
nonresidential building increased strongly in the fourth quarter. In
contrast, new orders for nondefense capital goods fell in December and are
now below the average level during the second and third quarters of 1984.
The drop in December, however, reflected an unusually sharp decline in
new orders for office and computing machinery, which probably is temporary.
Business Inventories
Investment in business inventories slowed markedly in late fall,
largely in response to the earlier weakness in orders and sales. In November,
stocks at all manufacturing and trade establishments were about unchanged
in real terms, compared with a $20 to $25 billion increase in preceding
months. Shipments and sales picked up in November, after remaining virtually
flat from August to October, and helped to lower the inventory-sales ratio
for all manufacturing and trade to 1.54 from the October high of 1.56.
In the manufacturing sector, inventory levels have not increased on
balance since September, helped by cutbacks in production. In November,
factory stocks declined in real terms for the first time in ten
months, and preliminary book-value data indicate that another decline
probably occurred in December.
At the retail level, strong sales in November helped to correct
imbalances that had cropped up in late summer and early fall. Nonauto retail
inventories were reduced at an annual rate of $4 billion in real terms,

merchandise and apparel stores, whose stocks became particularly burdensome
in early fall, were able to pare their stocks considerably. Nonetheless,
their November inventory-sales ratios were still high relative to last
spring, and further inventory corrections apparently took place at some of
these stores in December.
Auto dealers' stocks in December were little changed from the November
level as both assemblies and sales of domestic cars reached 8 million units.
Although the inventory positions of many dealers improved during the fourth
quarter, the supply of some General Motors cars remained tight at year end.
However, the step-up of assembly schedules in the first quarter should help
to alleviate this situation.
Housing Markets
Housing activity picked up slightly at the end of the fourth quarter,
but the improvement was not felt in all segments of the market. Housing
starts posted small gains in November and December, owing to increases in
the single-family component, but total starts remained below a 1.6 million
unit annual rate (chart). For the fourth quarter as a whole, starts were
off 6 percent from the reduced third-quarter pace.
Single-family starts turned up at year-end, rising about 5 percent in
both November and December. This improvement was accompanied by an upturn
in sales of existing homes, but new home sales remained flat despite lower
mortgage interest rates. Builders have been carrying moderately high
inventories of single-family dwellings, and as a result, have been relat ly
cautious in their production decisions.

In the multifamily sector, construction activity continued to
decline in the fourth quarter, with starts falling to a 550,000 unit
average annual rate. Overbuilding in some key markets contributed to a
further increase in the average vacancy rate for multifamily rental housing,
which reached 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter--a ten-year high. Incentives
to undertake rental housing projects--about two-thirds of total multifamily
starts-also may have been hurt by release of the Treasury tax plan, which
raised uncertainty about the future tax treatment of rental property.
Federal Government
The federal government recorded a deficit of $72 billion (unified
basis) during the first three months of fiscal 1985, about $9 billion larger
than the comparable figure a year earlier. Although receipts rose about $17
billion, outlays grew $26 billion. The relatively rapid rise of spending
reflected the retirement of previously tax-exempt HUD project notes1, as well
as large year-over-year increases in national defense spending, interest
outlays, and agricultural support payments.
The strength of defense spending in the fourth quarter contributed to
a 14 percent (annual rate) jump in real federal government purchases (NIA
basis). Changes in the defense component have been erratic in recent
quarters and are likely to remain volatile, owing to the variability of
delivery times for major weapons systems. However, on average, growth of
real defense spending over the near-term can be expected to be at about
the same 6 to 7 percent annual pace as in the last two years.
1. The one-time outlay for retirement of HUD project notes was $6.8 billion
in the October-December period and will total roughly $13 billion over
fiscal 1985. These short-term, tax-exempt notes originally were issued by
local public housing authorities and were guaranteed by HUD. Because the
tax-exempt status of the notes has become questionable, HUD is required to
borrow from the Treasury to retire the notes as they come due this fiscal
year.

II-13
The administration submitted its fiscal 1986 budget to Congress on
February 4, and a detailed analysis appears as an appendix to the Greenbook
supplement. The administration's budget figures are based on assumptions
of real GNP growth of about 4 percent per year during the 1985-1990 period
and a gradual decline in inflation from 4-1/4 percent in 1985 to around
3-1/2 percent by 1990.
The administration's estimate of the federal government deficit
(including off-budget outlays) in FY 1985 is now $222 billion, $42 billion
above their projection of last August. About a third of this increase in
the current year's deficit estimate results from the inclusion of HUD
project note payments, while another third reflects the effects of the
pause last year in economic activity. The remainder is split betwen the
impact of legislation enacted before Congress adjourned last fall and a
number of technical changes to prior estimates. The estimate of the budget
deficit for FY 1986, which incorporates $50 billion in recommended spending
cuts from the current services baseline, is $179 billion. Over the longer-term
horizon, the administration's projections show deficits declining to about
$90 billion by FY 1990. However, these lower deficits depend on sizable
additional spending cuts; on a current services basis, the administration's
projections remain in the $220 to $240 billion range throughout the period.
State and Local Sector
Growth in real outlays for goods and services by state and local
governments slowed appreciably in the fourth quarter to a 2 percent annual
rate, after an average 4 percent growth rate during the first three
quarters of the year. Most of the deceleration came in outlays for con-
struction, which were flat in the fourth quarter. However, this followed the

II-14
largest three-quarter gain in construction spending in 30 years, and for
1984 as a whole, real outlays for structures rose nearly 17 percent.
Based on preliminary data, the surplus of the state and local
sector operating and capital budget apparently increased somewhat in the
fourth quarter after a sharp reduction in the third quarter. The recent
improvement largely was the result of a significant rise in revenues,
reflecting an increase in the growth of personal and sales tax receipts,
as well as a jump in federal grants.
Exports and Imports
The merchandise trade deficit narrowed considerably in December,
lowering the deficit for the fourth quarter to $92 billion, its smallest
level in 1984. The sharp reduction in the trade deficit occurred as
imports fell back toward their first-half average from the extraordinarily
high level of the third quarter. Part of the swing in imports during the
second half of 1984 may have been associated with an adjustment of
inventories, as businesses cut back on both their domestic production and
orders from abroad. Nonetheless, the level of imports continued to
reflect the effects of the high and rising exchange value of the dollar
and the strong U.S. demand for foreign products. The small increase in
exports in the fourth quarter occurred mainly in agricultural goods,
especially in grain shipments to the USSR.
Non-oil import prices were essentially unchanged in the fourth quarter,
as the exchange value of the dollar continued to rise. The price of
imported oil declined by about 40 cents per barrel in the fourth quarter.
(Further discussion of international economic developments is included in
Section IV.)

II-15
Prices
Moderate labor costs, low-priced imports, and falling energy prices
continued to hold down the rate of inflation in the closing months of 1984.
The consumer price index rose only 0.2 percent in both November and December.
The producer price index for finished goods edged up 0.1 percent in December,
after a 0.5 percent increase the preceding month, and was up only 1.8
percent for all of 1984. More recently, freezing weather has damaged fruit
and vegetable crops in Florida, which may cause a spurt in food prices in
the near term. However, in the past, the price effects of such weather-related
disturbances proved to be short-lived and normally were reversed within a
few months.
As measured by the CPI, inflation in 1984 was little different from
the preceding year. Food prices advanced 3.8 percent, while the energy
component edged up slightly after a small decline in 1983. The prices of
other goods and services rose somewhat less rapidly last year than in 1983,
as small price increases or declines were posted in most major commodity
categories. Excluding used cars, prices of nonfood nonenergy commodities
advanced only 2-1/4 percent in 1984 after a 3-1/4 percent increase in 1983.
Used car prices had increased rapidly over the first half of 1984 before
declining in the second half. Service prices accelerated in 1984, with
relatively large increases in categories such as rent, auto finance charges,
and telephone services.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage inflation in the private nonfarm economy leveled off during the
second half of 1984 at a fairly moderate rate, according to a variety of
measures. The hourly earnings index for production and nonsupervisory

workers rose at a 2-3/4 percent annual rate in both the third and fourth
quarters. A more comprehensive measure, the employment cost index (ECI)
for wages and salaries, advanced at a 5 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter after an unusually small change the quarter before. On average,
the second-half increase in the ECI was at a 4 percent rate-a bit less
than during the first half of the year.
Over the course of 1984 as a whole, wage inflation slowed about 1
percentage point. That deceleration came mainly from industries receiving
the largest increases in 1983--namely, those in the private service-producing
sector of the economy. Wage increases for white-collar workers, many of
whom are employed in service-oriented industries, slowed substantially
during the past year, although increases for managers and professional and
technical workers were still rising almost 6 percent annually. Among
blue-collar workers, on the other hand, wage adjustments averaged 3-1/2
percent in 1984, or about the same as the year before.
New union settlements were quite moderate again last year. Wage
adjustments under contracts signed in 1984 will average 2.4 percent in the
first contract year and 2.3 percent annually over the contract life, (excluding
COLAs)-record lows in the 17-year history of these series. As a result of
the smaller settlements reached during the past three years, deferred
adjustments that are scheduled to be paid in 1985 will decline further. The
unprecedented incidence of wage cuts and freezes since 1981 has narrowed
the average differential between union and nonunion wage levels about 1-1/2
to 2 percentage points. That narrowing contrasts sharply with the experience

of the 1970s and early 1980s when the union-nonunion differential widened
perhaps 10 percentage points.
Meanwhile, productivity growth resumed in the fourth quarter after a
brief retrenchment associated with the slowdown in economic activity last
summer. When output was growing rapidly during the first half of 1984,
productivity in the nonfarm business sector advanced at a 4-1/4 percent
annual rate. But as output growth decelerated, labor productivity fell in
the third quarter and then picked up to a 1.7 percent rate of increase last
quarter. Over the year as a whole, the generally favorable productivity
performance, coupled with another moderate increase in hourly compensation,
held the rise in unit labor costs to less than 2 percent.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The monetary aggregates continued to grow rapidly in December and
January, probably in response to lower interest rates and renewed strength
in the economy. In recent days, money market rates have firmed noticeably,
evidently reflecting concerns that the System might be moving to a less
accommodative stance. Earlier in the intermeeting period, most short-
term rates had held at about the levels reached around the time of the
December FOMC meeting, as conditions in reserves markets continued rela-
tively steady. Federal funds have traded mostly in an 8 to 8-3/8 percent
range, just above the 8 percent discount rate (down from 8-1/2 percent)
established on December 21.
Long-term rates generally have fallen since mid-December, as oil
market developments and other price news seem to have contributed to a
lowering of inflation expectations. Though flattened a bit, the still
substantial upward slope of the term structure of rates suggests continued
uncertainty about the longer-term inflation outlook as well as concern
about the budget deficit and expectations of renewed strength in private
credit demands with the pickup in economic activity.
Aggregate borrowing by nonfinancial firms has been comparatively
light: short-term business borrowing was very weak in January, and bond
offerings have been well below last fall's average pace. What response
there has been among corporations to the drop in bond rates has occurred
in the Euromarket, where financial firms have dominated a heavy volume of
offerings thus far this year. Available information on household borrowing
suggests that growth in consumer installment credit remained very strong
in January; home mortgage borrowing has yet to show any clear pickup,

although market reports suggest that the continuing downtrend in mortgage
rates is resulting in a firming of demand. Borrowing in the tax-exempt
market has declined substantially in early 1985 because private-purpose
issues were rushed to the market late in 1984 to beat new restrictions.
At the same time, the federal government has continued to borrow heavily
to finance its deficit.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Note on the monetary data: Annual benchmark and seasonal factor
revisions are in process. The data reported here are on an
unrevised basis. A discussion of revisions to the monetary
aggregates will be included in the Bluebook.
In January, M1 growth continued at about the brisk pace of December.
Balances in Super NOW accounts may have been boosted by the January 1
reduction in the minimum denomination on these accounts from $2500 to $1000,
but inflows appear to have come mainly from regular NOW accounts. The
recent acceleration in M1 is consistent with models of money demand,
given interest rate declines since late summer and the pickup in economic
growth.
M2 expansion in January was off a bit from the exceptionally rapid
pace in November and December. Strength in the nontransactions component
of M2 continued to be concentrated in MMDAs and money market mutual funds.
In addition, overnight RPs and Eurodollars, which had run off in December,
rebounded strongly in January. Savings deposits declined again in January,
and small time deposits, which had been decelerating in previous months
from the very rapid pace of the summer, also contracted.
M2 growth in January does not appear to have been boosted by the
reduction in the minimum balance on MMDAs, but seems to have been related

primarily to continued favorable yield spreads. Since late last summer,
offering rates on MMDAs and money funds have lagged declines in market
rates significantly more than those on small time deposits. Consequently,
MMDAs and money funds have recorded strong inflows, while inflows to
small time deposits have weakened. More recently, the mix between money
funds and MMDAs has shifted, with inflows to money funds tending to
moderate and inflows to MMDAs strengthening as the yield spread between
the two types of accounts has narrowed and as MMDAs may have been boosted
slightly by the new minimum balance requirements.
M3 growth also slowed only moderately in January from the brisk
pace of the preceding two months. The continuing strength in this aggregate
primarily reflected growth of its M2 component, as the non-M2 components
slowed or registered declines. In January, inflows to institution-only
money funds increased at a much reduced pace from recent months as yield
relationships became less favorable. Large time deposits at commercial
banks (net of money fund holdings) contracted again, partly because of a
reduced need by banks for managed liabilities in view of strong inflows
to core deposits. Term Eurodollars and term RPs registered declines in
January; the decline in term RPs partly reflected the unwinding of a
holiday-related bulge in December.
Commercial bank credit is estimated to have decelerated further to
a 7 percent annual rate of growth in January, as holdings of securities
increased, while loan growth slowed. The increase in securities was in
the non-U.S. government category, and probably was a reflection of the
year-end surge in tax-exempt bond issuance. Business loans were virtually
flat for the second straight month, while real estate lending slowed a bit

from the December pace. Consumer loans also decelerated a bit, but
still expanded at a very rapid rate.
In December, and throughout the second half of 1984, business loan
growth was held down by strong competition from the commercial paper
market. However, in January commercial paper of nonfinancial businesses
contracted sharply even with a continued wide spread between paper rates
and the bank prime. As a result, the sum of total business loans at do-
mestic and foreign offices of U.S. banks plus commercial paper, which had
grown rapidly in recent months, contracted in January.
Business Finance
Longer-term business borrowing also has been comparatively re-
strained recently, despite a further decline in bond yields to almost 3
percentage points below their 1984 highs. Indeed, total business borrowing
seems to be running surprisingly low, given still substantial merger
activity layered on top of what probably is an appreciable gap between
capital spending and internal funds.
New issues of nonfinancial firms in the domestic bond market during
December and January were less than half the volume in the preceding two
months--although well above the pace in the first half of last year.
During most of the intermeeting period, many firms were apparently antici-
pating still further interest rate declines--as evidenced not only by the
moderate volume but also by the shortened maturities of the bonds issued.
In the past two months, only one-fifth of domestic and foreign offerings
of nonfinancial debt had maturities as long as 20 years, compared with
about three-eighths in the prior three months.

Volume in both domestic and overseas markets, however, continued
to be buoyed by financial offerings. In the last two months, banks have
accounted for nearly 50 percent of these offerings, compared with about
25 percent in 1984 as a whole. Nonetheless, the pace of domestic issues by
financial firms has eased from the fall, partly because GNMA yields have
fallen relative to other securities since November, making CMO issuance
by securities firms unprofitable.
Total Eurodollar offerings of financial and nonfinancial firms were
a record in January as a number of late December issues had been deferred
when interest rates turned up temporarily after Christmas. A strong
increase in floating-rate note issues by U.S. banks was coupled with a
flood of offerings in the Euro-yen market--mainly by nonfinancial firms,
and generally for swapping into dollar liabilities. The Euro-yen market has
been quite active since the Japanese relaxed restrictions on December 1.
Equity issuance has slowed of late even though the gains in bond
market prices have been more than matched by those of stock prices. Major
stock price indexes have increased 8 percent or more over the intermeeting
period, and the NYSE composite and Dow Jones Industrial indexes have hit
new highs. Net equity issuance by nonfinancial firms apparently is
continuing negative, owing to the redemption of outstanding shares in
mergers and share repurchases.
Government Finance
Federal sector. The staff is projecting a combined (on- and
off-budget) deficit of $65 billion for the first quarter. To meet its
financing requirements, the Treasury is expected to borrow around $49
billion, net, and to reduce its cash balance over the quarter by about

III-10
$8 billion. So far in the current quarter, the Treasury has raised
$12-1/4 billion through marketable borrowing. It is expected to meet
most of its remaining needs in auctions of coupon issues, although net
bill financing is expected to be substantial.
On January 15, the Treasury announced its STRIPS program to facili-
tate separate book-entry ownership and trading of coupon payments and
principal of selected note and bond issues. This program enables market
participants to create zero-coupon instruments that are direct obligations
of the U.S. Treasury. The 10-year notes and 30-year bonds in the February
refunding package will be the first Treasury securities eligible for this
program. The Treasury also announced, as part of the STRIPS program,
that the 30-year bond to be issued in the February refunding will have a
full 30 years of call protection. Previous 30-year bonds have had only
25 years of call protection.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies slowed
sharply in the fourth quarter and is not expected to pick up much in the
first quarter of 1985. The Federal Home Loan Banks are expected to raise
no new money this quarter, after repaying debt, on net, in December;
demand by savings and loan associations for FHLB advances has slackened
since September.1 In contrast, FNMA borrowed heavily in the fourth
quarter to fund its acquisitions of mortgages and has continued its rapid
pace of borrowing so far in the first quarter. The Farm Credit Banks
have been running off debt in recent months as the demand for loans by
the agricultural sector has weakened considerably; the declines in farm
1. Demand for FHLB advances was strong in the second quarter and most of
the third in part because of the funding problems of FCA's American
Savings and Loan subsidiary.

III-11
income and land values have left farmers with heavy debt burdens, and loan
defaults have increased. Thus far, the financial stress in the agricultural
sector has had little effect on the Farm Credit System. The System as a
whole will report profits in 1984 and its capital position is strong,
although a few of the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks have reported
financial difficulty. The debt securities sold by the Farm Credit System
in the financial markets have not carried an additional risk premium.
State and local sector. Issuance of tax-exempt bonds has fallen
substantially since the turn of the year. In January, offerings of
long-term tax-exempt securities totaled around $6.7 billion at a seasonally
adjusted monthly rate, following a record monthly average of $11 billion
in the fourth quarter. In the short-term market, offerings of tax-exempt
notes remained light owing to the continued absence of HUD project notes.
In the long-term market, major offerings early this year have
included general obligation bonds and highway and public utility revenue
bonds. In contrast, the volume of industrial development bonds and
single-family mortgage revenue bonds has been small, reflecting both the
1985 restrictions and volume caps imposed by the Deficit Reduction Act as
well as the large volume of anticipatory financing late last year.
With the slowdown in supply and easing in general market conditions,
interest rates on municipal bonds have fallen noticeably. The Bond Buyer
30-year revenue bond index, at 9.81 percent, is now 63 basis points below
its level at the time of the December FOMC. Reductions in rates on long-
term taxable securities have been less steep in recent months, and the
ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields has come down substantially from
its high near year-end.

3. Data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The supply of variable-rate demand notes, which (though nominally
long-term securities) put substantial pressure on short-term rates in the
fourth quarter, has virtually dried up since the December 31 deadline for
certain types of private-purpose issues. As a result, rates on 3- and
6-month tax-free notes have dropped 85 to 120 basis points since late
December, while yields on Treasury bills, for example, have risen. Thus
the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable short-term yields has fallen consider-
ably more since the end of last year than the ratio for bonds.
Mortgage Markets
Costs of housing finance have continued to decline, on balance,

older construction loans, in line with the two cuts in the bank prime
rate. On new mortgage commitments, contract interest rates at S&Ls for

conventional fixed-rate home loans fell 27 basis points to 12.93 percent--
the lowest level since June 1983 and 175 basis points below the recent
high registered last summer. Initial rates offered by S&Ls on new ARM
commitments declined more sharply. Thus, the spread between fixed- and
adjustable-rate mortgages has widened to about 230 basis points, still
well below last year's high in June. As a result of the decline in rates
on fixed-rate mortgages as well as the narrower rate spread favoring
adjustable-rate over fixed-rate loans during recent months, the volume of
ARMs has fallen markedly. In early January, ARMs accounted for only
about 50 percent of the total conventional closings.
ARM loan volume has been substantial for some time, despite its
recent decline. Staff estimates suggest that ARM originations at major
lenders rose from about 541 thousand loans in 1982 to nearly 1.6 million
loans in 1984. Although the precise distribution of these loans by
adjustment period is unknown, a large number of ARMs undoubtedly are
experiencing the first scheduled interest rate adjustment. Many ARMs
were originated at initial promotional discounts below typical program
interest rates. As these ARMs come up for adjustment, their contract
rates may be changed somewhat to reflect the expiration of initial discounts
as well as interim movements in such underlying indexes as short-term
Treasury securities or thrifts' costs of funds.
Demand for new mortgage loans in December apparently continued to
be relatively subdued, despite the recent decline in rates. At federally
insured S&Ls, however, trends were mixed through the end of the year. In
December, new commitments to originate mortgage loans were down a bit but
remained above September's low. Total new commitment volume, including

agreements to purchase loans, was virtually unchanged, while the backlog
of total mortgage commitments outstanding edged up for the first time in
three months. S&L net acquisitions of mortgage loans in December were
reduced owing in part to substantial swaps of mortgages for mortgage-backed
securities--some of which apparently were sold to buyers outside the S&L
industry.
Issuance of federally underwritten mortgage-backed securities
subsided in January. New issues of GNMA-guaranteed securities were slightly
above their reduced fourth-quarter pace, and swapping activity at both
FHLMC and FNMA dropped following hectic year-end transaction volume.
Consumer Credit
In December, growth of outstanding consumer installment debt may
have exceeded the 21 percent annual pace of November. Data for commercial
banks suggest a continuation of the strong rise in January.
Consumer installment credit growth has been substantial over the
.past two years. The'34 percent increase in total outstandings since
December 1982 has been larger than in any of the preceding five economic
upswings, while growth in personal consumption expenditures has been only
a bit faster than average. In part, the more rapid rise in debt likely
has reflected a cyclical pickup in new loan extensions coupled with an
abnormally weak uptrend in repayments reflecting low lending activity
during 1980-82.
The most rapid increases in consumer credit during 1984 were
registered primarily at savings and loans, mutual savings banks, commercial
banks, and credit unions. Consumer credit at thrift institutions has been
growing at a pace of more than 25 percent a year since 1981, reaching 45

III-18
percent in 1984. In part, this sharp advance from relatively low initial
levels reflected the improving economy and the expanded lending powers
granted by the DIDMCA. Commercial bank net lending increases also have
been sizable in the last couple of years, following very little growth in
the preceding two years, as auto loans and credit card operations grew
markedly.
The average contract rate on new-auto loans at captive finance
companies was little changed in December, remaining at 15.24 percent.
This rate had been moving up steadily since last March; by the end of
1984, it stood 132 basis points above its year-earlier level. Meanwhile,
the average maturity of new-car loans lengthened by nearly four full
months during 1984--reaching 50.2 months by year-end--and the average
loan size increased by 6 percent to $9,707. Consequently, the average
monthly payment edged up last year to $263 in December, as increases in
the cost and size of loans outweighed the effect of the longer maturity.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting, the trade-weighted value of the
dollar, shown in the top panel of Chart 1, has appreciated more than
4-1/4 percent to a new record level in nominal and real terms. The
dollar is at or near peak levels for the floating rate period on a
bilateral basis against most major currencies.
Part of the dollar's continued strength derives from recent
indications that U.S. economic growth in the last quarter of 1984 and
the first quarter of 1985 is somewhat more robust than earlier
anticipated, while U.S. inflation has not shown signs of accelerating.
The pace of economic activity abroad has not been uniform across
countries, with Japanese growth exceeding that of the European economies.
As can also be seen in the top panel of Chart 1, the dollar's
appreciation has occurred while the short-term nominal interest
differential in favor of assets denominated in U.S. dollars has
decreased. The spread of long-term U.S. yields over those of comparable
foreign assets has narrowed slightly. In the past week, however, dollar
interest rates have risen sharply relative to foreign rates, despite
increases in some European interest rates.
The dollar's recent appreciation has been particularly strong in
terms of sterling and the Swiss franc, which have declined about 7
percent against the dollar. Because of their differential weakness
against the dollar, the pound and Swiss franc have depreciated more than
3-1/2 percent on balance over the past seven weeks, while the mark and

yen declined only 1 and 1-1/2 percent in terms of their respective trade-
weighted indices.
Sterling has been under particularly strong downward pressure
throughout the intermeeting period, largely because of the general
softness of world oil prices. With North Sea oil exports currently
representing about 20 percent of the total value of U.K. exports, the
pound has been strongly influenced by the recent weakness in spot market
prices for North Sea Brent crude.
Compounding the negative impact on sterling of oil was an
acceleration of speculative selling of the pound in early January when
statements by the British authorities were interpreted as indicating an
unwillingness to take any action to halt the pound's slide. The British
government initially appeared reticent to force up interest rates in the
face of 13 percent unemployment, and substantial foreign exchange market
intervention was at variance with the Thatcher government's long-standing
view that intervention should be limited to smoothing operations.
Starting in mid-January, however, the Bank of England proceeded to raise
its money market dealing rates on three occasions, for a total increase
of 4-3/8 percentage points to a level of about 14 percent by the end of
January. After the final jump in the official British dealing rates by a
surprising 2 percentage points, the pound began to strengthen, recovering
more than 1 percent in the last week of January from its record low level
against the dollar. U.K. short-term interest rates have also eased
somewhat in the past week, confirming the expectation that the surge in
U.K. interest rates will be short-lived. Finally, although little
concrete progress has yet been reported in the 11-month old coal miners'

IV-4
strike, there is a bit more optimism that negotiations may resume in the
near future.
Within the EMS, the Belgian franc, which had been at the bottom of
the EMS band for much of 1984, has risen to the middle of the band. This
relaxing of exchange market pressure has permitted the Belgian authori-
ties to repay fully their FECOM debt and, in recent weeks, they have
reported a series of small adjustments in the currency composition of
their reserves. The Danish krone has now risen to the top of the EMS
band, and its spread above the guilder at the bottom has exceeded 2
percent in recent weeks,
.The
G-5 statement on January 17, reiterating the Williamsburg Summit commit-
ment to undertake coordinated intervention "as necessary," heightened
market concern over the possibility of sizable concerted sales of
dollars. The subsequent series of highly visible and occasionally
coordinated sales of dollars by a number of central banks sometimes
appeared to thwart the dollar's rise, but only temporarily. In the past
week, widely perceived coordinated intervention by the Bundesbank and the

IV-5
System failed to stem
the dollar's brisk ascent to new record levels on an effective basis and
against most currencies. Since the last FOMC meeting, the Desk has made
total dollar sales against foreign currencies of $241.5 million, evenly
split for the accounts of the System and Treasury. Of that total, sales
of $192.7 million were made against marks, while $48.8 million were made
against yen.

IV-6
U.S. International Financial Transactions
There were large recorded capital inflows into the United States
through a wide variety of channels in October and November, 1984. As shown
on the summary table of U.S. International Transactions, these inflows
included net increases in foreign official reserve assets in the United
States, net foreign private purchases of U.S. corporate bonds and Treasury
securities, as well as net inflows reported by banks.
Increases in official reserve assets in the United States totaled
$5 billion in October and November and were spread among the G-10 countries
and certain less developed countries. Latin American official holdings in
the United States (excluding OPEC members) increased by $1.0 billion, adding
to the $1.3 billion increase in the first nine months of the year, and
reflecting improvement in their external positions. On the other hand
official holdings of the OPEC countries continued to decline, bringing the
total decline for the year through November to $8.2 billion. Partial data
from the FRBNY indicate that official reserve assets in the United States
also increased substantially in December, but declined in January.
Net foreign private purchases of U.S. corporate bonds, most of which
were new issues of Eurobonds, totaled $6.3 billion in October and November.
There were also large new issues of Eurobonds by U.S. corporations in
December and January, including approximately $1.3 billion equivalent
denominated in Japanese yen. These latter issues illustrate the effect
of changes in regulation and taxation on patterns of international
intermediation. The Japanese government broadened the list of permitted
foreign issuers of Euroyen bonds to include U.S. and other corporate
borrowers, as of December 1. This action opened up new arbitrage

opportunities. Interest payments on Euroyen bonds issued by
non-Japanese corporations are not subject to the Japanese withholding
tax, nor are interest payments on Eurodollar bonds issued by Japanese
companies. But Euroyen issues by Japanese companies are subject to
withholding. In effect, a Japanese firm can obtain fixed-rate Euroyen
debt that is not subject to withholding by issuing Eurodollar bonds and
swapping interest and principal payments with a U.S. corporation that
has issued Euroyen bonds. An additional incentive for these
arrangements is provided by Japanese regulations that limit the
percentage of portfolios that Japanese institutional investors may
invest in foreign assets. Purchases of Eurodollar bonds issued by
Japanese companies do not count as foreign assets, and, because of
strong demand from Japanese investors, Japanese companies can borrow at
lower rates in the Eurodollar bond market than comparable U.S.
companies. The Japanese government, in response to the rapid growth of
these currency swaps since the beginning of December, has proposed, as
of April 1, to exempt Euroyen issues of Japanese companies from the
withholding tax. This action would tend to reduce the cost savings
available to U.S. corporations through swaps with Japanese
corporations.
The heavy issue of Eurobonds by U.S. commercial banks in 1984 also
reflects, in part, the impact of regulation. Of the almost $6 billion
issued by the 25 largest bank holding companies in 1984, about half
included mandatory convertible features. These issues added to primary
capital under Federal Reserve guidelines and improved capital adequacy.
In January, the twenty-five largest banks issued an additional $1.9
billion in Eurobonds; again most issues were floating rate notes and

IV-9
included convertible features that allowed the funds raised to count as
primary capital.
Net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities by private foreigners
were also very large in October and November. Of the $5.3 billion
purchased, $2.0 billion were specially targeted for foreigners.
Information on secondary market trading indicates that these specially
targeted issues are now yielding about the same as regular Treasuries.
Under these circumstances it seems unlikely that the Treasury will be
able to realize substantial cost savings through additional issues of
specially targeted securities in the immediate future. Overall, net
foreign private purchases of U.S. Treasury securities reached a record
$18.4 billion in the first eleven months of 1984.
Net international capital inflows into banks in the United States
totaled about $8 billion in October and November. As shown on line 3
of the table on International Banking Data, the $3 billion reduction in
monthly average net claims of banks on their own foreign offices and
IBFs between September and December followed a reduction of $8 billion
earlier in the year. The bulk of these inflows consisted of
withdrawals by regional banks of placements made in the Eurodollar
interbank markets in 1982 and early 1983.
For much of 1984, 22 of the largest 23 banks (excluding
Continental) could not increase their Eurodollar borrowings
substantially without subjecting the additional borrowing to the
Eurocurrency reserve requirement. Despite this fact, evidence from
interest rate relationships does not indicate that the operation of the
Eurocurrency reserve requirement increased the cost of funds to U.S.

banks significantly. Although banks bound by the Eurocurrency reserve
requirement have an incentive to substitute Federal Funds for
borrowings in the Eurodollar interbank markets, Federal Funds rates
have not risen relative to Eurodollar rates. Arbitrage by banks not bound
by the Eurocurrency reserve requirement has been sufficient so that no
significant differential has appeared to date between rates for funds in
these two markets.
In January (through the 21st) net claims of banks in the United States
on their foreign offices were $6 billion on average higher than in December.
These outflows were concentrated at large banks and probably reflect, in
part, strong core deposit growth combined with weak business loan demand at
domestic offices.

IV-12
U.S. Merchandise Trade
With a substantial reduction in the trade deficit in December, the
deficit for the fourth quarter was smaller than in any other quarter of
1984. For the year 1984, the deficit was $108 billion, more than $45
billion larger than a year earlier.
Exports increased somewhat in the fourth quarter from third-quarter
rates. Much of the rise in value was in agricultural shipments, primarily
grain exports to the Soviet Union. The USSR purchased an exceptionally
high 13.2 million metric tons (MMT) of grain in the third quarter, which
resulted in a doubling of the volume of U.S. grain shipments to the USSR in
the fourth quarter (to 8.2 MMT). The current grain agreement calls for
annual purchases by the USSR of a minimum of 9 MMT and a maximum of 12 MMT
of grain from the United States. President Reagan has agreed to allow the
USSR to purchase up to 22 MMT of grain in the agreement-year ending

September 30, 1985; as of January 24, the USSR has ordered 14.0 MMT of
which 10.5 MMT have been shipped. The fourth-quarter rise in the value of
agricultural exports occurred despite a drop in export prices. The
weakening of agricultural export prices, which resumed last July, is a
consequence of record harvests in many parts of the world.
The small increase in nonagricultural exports in the fourth quarter
from the third quarter occurred as increases in some commodity categories
(e.g., petroleum products, business machines, and aircraft) were largely
offset by declines in other items (e.g., coal, automotive parts to Canada,
and gold). However, compared with the level of exports a year earlier, the
volume of nonagricultural exports increased by a notable 9-1/2 percent
(4Q/4Q). By area, the rise in nonagricultural exports over the year was
fairly broadly based; shipments expanded at about the overall average rate
to Canada, Western Europe, Asia (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan),
and Latin America excluding Mexico. The value of nonagricultural exports
to Mexico (which account for about 5 percent of all U.S. shipments)
increased by 50 percent (4Q/4Q) from low 1983 levels. Nonagricultural
exports to Japan (which account for about 9 percent of all U.S. shipments)
were about the same in 1984 as in 1983 (4Q/4Q).
Nonoil imports in the fourth quarter dropped from the extraordinarily
high rate recorded in the third quarter. Nonetheless, nonoil imports in
the fourth quarter continued to be strongly affected by the strength of
U.S. economic activity and the high exchange value of the dollar; nonoil
imports were nearly 15 percent higher than a year earlier (4Q/4Q) with most
of the change in volume. Year over year, the value of nonoil imports
increased by 30 percent. The increase was spread broadly over the major

IV-14
commodity categories -- capital goods (especially business machines and
other electronic products), industrial supplies, consumer goods, and
automotive products (half of the increase in this category was from
Canada).
The volume of oil imported in the fourth quarter was slightly less
than the average rates for both the second and third quarters; the volume
dropped sharply in December to 5.1 million barrels per day. The average
price of imported oil was about 30 cents per barrel less than in the third
quarter. Ample supply and moderate demand have put downward pressure on
world oil prices since mid-1984.

Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity in the major
foreign industrial countries continued at an uneven pace into the
fourth quarter, after relatively strong real GNP growth rates were seen
in the third quarter of last year. Industrial production in the three
months to November was above its year-ago level in all countries. The
strongest advance in production was recorded by Japan with over 10
percent, followed by Canada with 5 percent and the continental European
countries with 2 to 4 percent. In the United Kingdom, where the coal
miners' strike is in its eleventh month, industrial production in
recent months has barely regained its level of late 1983.
Inflation abroad has continued to slow. The rates of increase of
consumer price indices in December 1984 from a year earlier were the
lowest since the late 1960s or early 1970s in all countries except in
Japan, where the rate in 1983 was lower than in 1984. The gains made
against inflation last year were strongest in those countries (Italy,
France) that still have relatively high inflation rates.
The Bank of England, in response to strong downward pressure on
sterling, raised its money market dealing rates by 4-3/8 percentage
points in three steps between January 11 and 28. The Bundesbank, on
January 31, raised its Lombard rate from 5.5 to 6.0 percent. The Dutch
Central Bank raised its official rate also by one-half of one
percentage point.
Individual Country Notes. The pace of economic activity in Japan
increased in the fourth quarter after a slowdown in the previous
quarter. Industrial production in the fourth quarter rose 2.9 percent

(s.a.), following a 1.5 percent increase in the third quarter.
Personal consumption spending appears to be picking up, as retail sales
in December rose by 2.1 percent (s.a.). Private plant and equipment
investment also continues to show a healthy rate of increase,
especially in high technology industries. After a 6-1/4 percent (s.a.)
jump in October, housing starts declined by almost 2 percent in
November. New housing starts in the first 11 months of 1984 were 4.4
percent above their year-earlier level.
Consumer prices in 1984 rose by only 2.4 percent (Q4/Q4) despite
the pick-up in activity. The increase in the inflation rate in the
fourth quarter reflects seasonal factors. Wholesale price inflation
remains about zero.
Both the trade and current accounts showed record surpluses last
year of, respectively, $44 and $35 billion. The value of exports in
1984 was up by almost 16 percent, with exports to the United States
accounting for almost 75 percent of the increase. Sales to Latin
America rose by about 35 percent. Imports rose by about 8-1/2 percent
last year, with imports of manufactured goods being especially strong
(up 21 percent).
On January 25, the long-term prime rate was cut from 7.6 to 7.4
percent. For several months, long-term rates have declined gradually,
while short-term rates have remained flat. The Bank of Japan has
indicated that its policy is to maintain the discount rate to avoid any
weakening of the yen. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the Ministry
of Finance (MoF) has decided to permit five major city banks to issue

IV -20
convertible bonds for the first time, provided that only Eurobonds are
issued and that the funds raised are used only for expansion of bank
capital or investment in plant and equipment. The banks on the other
hand are reportedly interested in such issues as a way of funding
Euroyen lending and are anticipating that the MoF will decide soon to
permit medium- and long-term Euroyen lending. At present, the MoF
limits Euroyen lending to a term of one year or less.
German real GNP grew 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter according
to provisional data to a level 3.2 percent above the fourth quarter of
1983. The strength of this result reflects continued rebounding from
last summer's strike. Industrial production has shown a similar
pattern of rebounding from low levels last summer. The GNP data for
the fourth quarter point to exports as a source of strength, followed
by investment in equipment. Private consumption has remained subdued,
and construction continues to show weakness. The rate of unemployment
was 9.2 percent (s.a.) in January, only slightly below its peak in
mid 1983. Consumer price inflation has been very moderate, although
the monthly rate (n.s.a.) in January was 0.6 percent. Compared to
January of last year, the index was 2.1 percent higher. Producers and
wholesale prices are showing similarly moderate increases, but import
prices have been accelerating more strongly, to a level almost 6
percent above a year ago.
Reflecting the strong surge of exports in the second half of last
year, the 1984 trade balance showed a record surplus of almost $19
billion. The current account surplus for 1984 was $6 billion, compared

IV -21
to $4.1 billion in 1983.
On January 31, the Bundesbank raised its Lombard rate from 5.5 to
6.0 percent. This move is consistent with its recently tightened
monetary target although the Bundesbank has emphasized the technical
reason of placing the Lombard rate above the overnight rate. In
December, the Bundesbank had lowered its monetary growth target for
1985 to 3-5 percent from 4-6 percent in 1984.
Real GDP (average measure) in the United Kingdom grew 1.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter while the index of industrial
production recovered in October and November to the level reached prior
to the onset of the ongoing coal miners' strike. To date, the effect
of the 10-1/2 month strike on coal-using industries has been limited;
and, although the production of coal has been substantially reduced, it
appears that coal supplies will be adequate to meet winter needs.
The U.K. unemployment rate reached a peak of 13 percent (s.a.) in
January. The retail price index fell slightly in December, lowering
its twelve-month change to 4.6 percent. The U.K. trade deficit was
$5.7 billion in 1984 reflecting, in part, decreased net exports of
energy products as a result of the coal miners' strike. The current
account was near balance, compared with a $4.4 billion surplus in
1983.
The Bank of England increased its money market dealing rates by 1
percentage point on January 11 and by 1-3/8 percentage points on
Monday, January 14, as sterling reached record lows both against the
dollar and on a trade-weighted basis. The Bank also took the unusual

IV -22
step of posting its Minimum Lending Rate (at 12 percent) on January 14
prior to increasing its dealing rates. The posted MLR was to hold only
for one day and the Bank subsequently returned to its normal practice
of not posting its MLR. Further rises in market interest rates
associated with a renewed weakening of the pound led the Bank to
increase its money market dealing rates by an additional 2 percentage
points on January 28. On February 5, the Bank's shortest-term money
market dealing rate was 13-7/8 percent; the clearing banks' base rate
was 14 percent.
On January 22, the U.K. government released a white paper setting
out its plans to squeeze public spending in order to make way for tax
cuts. Real public expenditure is scheduled to fall by 1 percent in
1985/86 and then be held constant for the following two fiscal years.
The detailed 1985/86 budget will be presented to Parliament in March.
Continuing trends that prevailed throughout 1984, recent data
indicate that economic activity in France has been weak, the inflaiton
rate has declined, and the trade and current accounts have moved from
deficit toward surplus. Industrial production declined by 1.5 percent
(s.a.) in November, reversing most of the increase of the previous
month, and leaving industrial production for September-November 2.1
percent above its year-earlier level. The unemployment rate rose to
10.5 percent at the end of 1984, compared with a 9.3 percent rate at
the end of 1983.
Consumer prices increased by only 0.3 percent (n.s.a.) in
November and 0.2 percent in December, reducing the year-over-year

IV -23
inflation rate at the end of 1984 to 6.8 percent. This is above the
government's original inflation target of 5 percent for the year, but
still represents a substantial reduction from the previous year's 9.8
percent inflation rate.
The current account in the fourth quarter was in surplus by $500
million (s.a.). For 1984 as a whole, the current account was in
deficit by only $200 million, compared with deficits of $4.9 billion in
1983 and $12.1 billion in 1982.
Canadian third-quarter real GNP increased at an annual rate of
7.6 percent after an average pace of 3.3 percent in the first half of
the year. Although growth in private investment increased in 1984,
capital formation has been extremely low over the last six or seven
quarters. Even with recent increases, gross fixed capital formation in
the third quarter was about 12 percent below the peak reached in 1981.
Industrial production increased 2.2 percent in November to a level 5.5
percent above November 1983. Unemployment stood at 10.8 percent in
December, two percentage points below the peak in December 1982.
Inflation continued to be moderate in 1984. Consumer prices in
December were only 3.7 percent above year-earlier levels, matching the
inflation rates in 1971 and 1972. This slower rate of inflation
compares favorably with last year's pace of 4.6 percent. In addition,
inflation in Canada's industry selling price index in October was also
a moderate 3.4 percent. Canada's trade surplus increased in November
to $15 billion on a cumulative basis, compared to $13.2 billion for the
comparable period a year before. The current account showed a

IV -24
cumulative surplus of $1 billion for the first three quarters of 1984
compared to a $1.4 billion surplus for all of 1983.
Although the new Conservative government has stirred broad
debate about tax reform and free trade with the United States, it is
doubtful that a consensus will emerge soon. While some budget cuts
will probably be made, the new government is moving with caution on
campaign promises of budgetary discipline.
The recovery in Italy moderated somewhat in the fourth quarter of
1984. Industrial production dropped in October and November, but
preliminary data show a slight upturn in December; the yearly average
of Italian industrial production was 3.5 percent higher in 1984 than in
1983. The year-over-year rate of increase of consumer prices in
January 1985 was 8.6 percent, compared with 12.5 percent in January
1984. The official November household survey indicates that consumers
feel that inflation has moderated and expect it to continue to do so in
the next year.
Italy's trade account deteriorated sharply in November,
registering one of the largest monthly deficits in history at $2.3
billion (s.a.); the trade account deficit in the first 11 months of
1984 was $10.4 billion compared with $6.9 billion in the same period in
1983. Exports of petroleum products, accounting for eight percent of
the value of total Italian exports, decreased by 51 percent between
November 83 and November 1984. There also has been some concern that
the lira may be overvalued with respect to other currencies in the
European Monetary System.

IV -25
The Visentini tax reform has been promulgated by decree law and
has survived a vote of confidence in the Senate. The tax reform is
expected to raise tax collections by an amount equivalent to about 13
percent of the 1984 budget deficit. However, the 1985 budget calls for
an increase in the public sector deficit, although the share of the
deficit in GDP is expected to decline from more than 15 percent in 1984
to about 14 percent in 1985. On January 4, Italian authorities lowered
the discount rate from 16.5 percent to 15.5 percent. The rate had been
lowered in February 1984 and raised in September 1984.

IV-26
Debt Situation in Selected Developing Countries
On December 28, Argentina received IMF Executive Board approval of
an SDR 1.42 billion 15-month stand-by credit in support of its economic
stabilization program and of an SDR 275 million Compensatory Financing
Facility (CFF) drawing. The Board acted after receiving assurances that
sufficient external financing would be available to cover Argentina's
1984-85 financing gap. (However, commitments to the new money package
are still short of the $4.2 billion target.) Given approval of the IMF
package and substantial commitments to bank financing, the U.S. Treasury
activated on December 28 a $500 million bridge loan announced earlier.
The Treasury funds, augmented by $100 million supplied by Mexico and
$250 million drawn from Argentine reserves, helped Argentina to repay
$850 million of public sector interest arrears to the banks before the
end of 1984. The Treasury loan was repaid partly on January 3 from the
proceeds of the CFF credit and partly on January 15 from the first dis-
bursement of the IMF stand-by credit. A Paris Club restructuring of
$2.1 billion in principal and interest owed to official creditors, in
arrears and falling due in 1985, was agreed upon on January 16. The
monthly rate of Argentine inflation (measured by the CPI), which had
declined to 15 percent in November, the lowest rate since January 1984,
rose again to nearly 20 percent in December and is expected to be about
24 percent in January. The official peso price of the dollar rose apace
with the CPI in December and (if current expectations about the January
CPI increase are realized) also in January. The free market premium for
the dollar, which narrowed in late November and especially in the first
three weeks of December (after Argentina reached agreement with its bank

IV-27
advisory committee on a 1984-85 financing package), increased again in
late December and January, reaching 28.5 percent on January 25 before
declining to 19.1 percent at the end of the month. Money was very tight
in December when unregulated rates on unsecured loans exceeded 50
percent per month, but conditions eased considerably thereafter and the
unsecured loan rate fell to about 23 percent on January 23. Moreover,
recent adjustments in public sector prices lagged behind the rate of
inflation in January.
On December 14, the IMF approved an SDR 615 million, 18-month,
stand-by arrangement for the Philippines, culminating negotiations that
had continued off and on since September 1983. On December 20 the Paris
Club agreed to reschedule approximately $1.1 billion in Philippine
external debts to official creditors. During the first week of 1985 the
Philippines fell out of compliance with the IMF program by failing to
meet the performance criterion for reserve money (a type of monetary
base concept). The central bank plans to sell bills in order to reduce
the amount of reserve money below the ceiling set for the end of March
1985. Failure to observe that ceiling would probably mean that the
Philippines could not make a second drawing on the IMP stand-by arrange-
ment. On January 25, Banco Filipino-the Philippines' largest savings
bank with some 3.7 million depositors-was placed under receivership and
its deposit accounts were transferred to the government-owned Philippine
National Bank, following a determination by the Monetary Board that the
bank was insolvent.
The minimum wage in Mexico was increased by 30 percent effective
January 1, bringing it to a level 56 percent higher than in January

IV-28
1984. The next increase in the minimum wage is expected to be around
mid-year. The size of the January wage increase and the magnitude of
the announced 1985 public sector deficit, which is larger in relation to
GDP than envisaged for this year in the original IMF-approved economic
stabilization program, suggest that the resolve of the authorities to
follow through on their adjustment program in the macroeconomic area may
have weakened. This tendency may be intensified by the approach of
mid-term congressional elections in July 1985. In 1985, the Mexican
authorities project a real GDP growth of 3-4 percent (after a 2-3
percent growth rate in 1984) and an inflation rate of 35 percent on a
December-to-December basis (after a 59 percent inflation rate in 1984).
However, the recent fiscal policy and wage policy measures point to
inflation of perhaps 45 percent in 1985. In 1984, Mexico's current
account surplus is estimated at about $4.5 billion and total inter-
national reserves (excluding gold) rose by a similar amount.
Colombia has been unable to complete negotiations with banks on a
refinancing package for Banco de Colombia. The Colombian authorities
are continuing to discuss their overall financial needs for 1985-86 with
the banks, the IMF, and the IBRD; a bank committee has been formed to
advise Colombia on this problem. After a recent meeting, the committee
informed Colombia that the country's financing package was not saleable
without a formal IMF program. Since mid-December, new taxes have been
approved by the Colombian Congress, gasoline prices and utility rates
have been increased significantly, and public sector wages have been
raised by 8 percentage points less than the most recent 12-month
increase in the consumer price index. Some public investments have also

IV-29
been postponed. A special session of the legislature is to consider
further expenditure containment measures. An IMF staff team is expected
to visit Colombia in February to assess the country's adjustment
measures.
In Venezuela, some progress appears to have been made in the regis-
tration of private sector debt and the payment of interest arrears. By
December 31, the Venezuelan authorities had made decisions concerning
the validity of some $6.5 billion of the total $8-$10 billion in private
sector debts. While only $300 million in interest arrears was actually
paid by the end of the year, the progress in debt registration was
sufficient for Venezuela and its creditor banks to begin discussion on
January 31 of the terms sheet for the multi-year rescheduling agreement
negotiated last September. Venezuela expects the rescheduling agreement
to be completed sometime this July. Real GDP declined by 1.9 percent in
1984. At the same time, the inflation rate increased to an estimated 15
percent during the year (December to December). The public sector
deficit, which was 4.7 percent of GDP in 1983, showed a surplus of 5.4
percent of GDP for 1984. Venezuela's current account surplus was about
$4.4 billion, somewhat higher than its 1983 surplus.
Brazil is not requesting new money from banks in 1985, in part
because its gross reserves (excluding gold) at the end of last year were
approximately $12 billion. Instead, Brazil and the commercial banks are
negotiating a multi-year rescheduling under which $45 billion of debt
coming due to public and private sector debtors between 1985 and 1991
would be rescheduled, and spreads would be reduced from the close to 2
percentage points spread now prevailing. Brazil's IMF program for this

IV-30
year is expected to go to the IMF Executive Board on March 10. Brazil
registered a trade surplus of $13 billion in 1984; the value of exports
grew some 23 percent while imports fell 9 percent. The current account
registered a surplus of $200 million (excluding $700 million of re-
invested profits). The general price index increased by 10.5 percent in
December and 12.6 percent in January. Economic activity has shown
continued signs of strength and real GDP is expected to grow 4-5 percent
this year, after growing by 4 percent in 1984. Growth in the monetary
base in December 1984 was 37 percent, the largest monthly increase ever
recorded. It now appears that Brazil exceeded the ceiling for the
nominal public sector borrowing requirement for the end of 1984, largely
because of the greater than expected inflation, and also may have missed
the end-year target for the operational public sector borrowing require-
ment (adjusted for inflation). Brazil's domestic economic performance
in 1984 calls into question the credibility of the 1985 IMF program and
the successful completion in the short run of its debt rescheduling with
the commercial banks.
Peru, which has been out of compliance with its IMF program since
June 1984, paid about $50 million in overdue interest owed to banks in
early January, bringing interest current through early July 1984.
Peru's interest arrears to banks are now approximately $300 million.
The new finance minister has developed a plan to reduce the fiscal
deficit and eliminate external arrears by end-1985, but the unrealistic
assumptions that form the basis for the current fiscal budget and the
hesitancy of Peru's president to authorize austerity moves prior to the
April 28 election tend to undermine the credibility of the current
government.

IV-31
Chile is continuing its negotiations with the IMF over a new stand-
by arrangement; issues to be resolved include the size of the public
sector and current account deficits. A real depreciation of about 17
percent since September 1984 and a rise in the price of copper in
January 1985 have improved Chile's external prospects. However, con-
cerns over the availability of funding from multilateral development
banks complicate Chile's efforts to finance a current account deficit
that may be little changed from the $1.7 billion deficit registered in
1984.
