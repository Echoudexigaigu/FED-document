 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity appears to have expanded at a moderate rate in early
1985. Growth in domestic spending was quite strong, but a good deal of the
increased demand for goods was met by imports rather than domestic production.
Consumer spending rose substantially in February, and housing market activity
on average has picked up a bit. Trends in business investment have been
mixed; spending on new equipment has been sluggish, while nonresidential
construction remains robust. Recent price reports continued to be favorable.
Employment and Unemployment
Nonfarm payroll employment rose a moderate 120,000 in February, after
four months of very strong growth. Retail trade and services posted further
strong job gains, but manufacturing employment fell 75,000. About one-
third of the decline in factory jobs occurred in the auto industry; the
significance of this decline is questionable given that assemblies were
back to a very high level in early March. Even so, many other manufacturers,
including those in thelumber, machinery, textiles, and apparel industries,
also reported job cutbacks. In addition, the factory workweek fell six-tenths
of a hour, in large part owing to unusually harsh weather during the survey
reference week. Bad weather probably hindered construction activity as
well and may explain the drop of 50,000 in construction employment.
The civilian unemployment rate edged down to 7.3 percent in February.
After falling rapidly over the first year and a half of the expansion, the
jobless rate has fluctuated in the 7.2 to 7.5 percent range since last
spring. Most of the job gains over the past several months occurred among
adult women and teenagers; yet, because stong demand has drawn additional

women and youth into the labor market, their unemployment rates have remained
relatively flat.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production declined 0.5 percent in February, and output
gains during the three preceding months were smaller than previously estimated.
The overall industrial production index now is no higher than it was in
mid-1984. The sluggishness in production during the past half year, reflects
a continued substitution of imports for domestically produced goods and
ongoing corrections of inventory imbalances in some industries.
Production cutbacks in February-attributable only in part to bad
weather-were widespread among products and materials. The output of
consumer goods declined 0.6 percent, while production of business equipment
dropped for a second consecutive month. Automobile assemblies-at an 8.2
million unit annual rate-fell short of planned schedules after reaching an
8.6 million unit rate in January. Meanwhile, capacity utilization rates
generally have dropped back since last summer. In February, the operating
rate for total industry fell to 80.7 percent compared with its recent high
of 82.7 percent in July 1984.
Personal Income and Consumption
Personal income grew $15 billion per month on average during the
first two months of 1985, the same as the fourth-quarter pace. Income
growth in January was boosted substantially by annual cost-of-living adjustments
to government benefit programs, other factors affecting transfer payments,
and pay raises for federal civilian and military personnel. Meanwhile,
growth in private wages and salaries, which represent roughly half of

total personal income, slowed noticeably. Part of the recent slowdown in
wages and salaries was attributable to weakness in manufacturing payrolls,
reflecting the contraction in employment since December.
Nominal personal consumption expenditures rose at about a 9 percent
annual rate in the first two months of the year, compared with 6 percent in
the fourth quarter. In January, outlays for services rose sharply, apparently
because unusually cold weather raised electricity and natural gas consumption,
while spending on goods other than autos declined. In February, spending
on goods posted a strong gain, as almost all major types of stores reported
higher sales. Excluding sales of autos, nonconsumer items, and gasoline,
retail outlays in February were 2.1 percent above the fourth-quarter average.
Consumer spending on new cars remained strong through early March.
Total auto sales averaged about 11 million units at an annual rate in
January and February-the highest level of sales over a two-month period
since the first half of 1979. Sales of domestic models have averaged
around 8-1/2 million units at an annual rate thus far in the first quarter,
about a million units above the fourth-quarter pace. Demand for foreign
cars also remains strong, but limited supplies of Japanese cars have curtailed
sales lately. With the quota year drawing to a close on March 31, Japanese
producers have slowed deliveries to the U.S. in order to stay within their
export restraints.
Recent survey readings of consumer confidence were close to the high
levels reported earlier in the expansion. In surveys taken during both
January and February, respondents expressed greater interest in buying
automobiles and household durable goods than they did late last year.

According to the Michigan survey, the more favorable buying plans were due
to lower prices and interest rates. In response to special questions
pertaining to the Administration's tax reform plans, most households thought
that, if proposed tax reforms were passed, the changes would have little impact
on their own personal finances.
Business Fixed Investment
Spending for business equipment has turned sluggish lately, after
rising rapidly earlier in the expansion. Growth in expenditures on producers'
durable equipment in real terms slowed to just a 2 percent annual rate in
the fourth quarter, and more recent indicators of demand for domestically
produced equipment show considerable weakness. Shipments of nondefense
capital goods by domestic producers plunged 10.4 percent in January, with
declines reported for nearly every category of equipment. To some extent,
this weakness was counterbalanced by higher demand for equipment produced
abroad. In addition, business purchases of motor vehicles remained quite
strong.
In contrast with equipment spending, construction spending still is
growing at a robust pace. Outlays for nonresidential construction expanded
2.7 percent in January, continuing the brisk growth shown in the fourth
quarter. Office and other commercial building activity remained especially
strong, although some weakness is still evident in the public utility and
institutional sectors.
Like the evidence on current spending, indicators of future business
spending also are mixed. New orders for nondefense capital goods received
by domestic producers fell 13 percent in January, after showing no growth

over the second half of 1984. Orders for office and computing equipment
were exceptionally low for the second month in a row, and there were widespread
declines among other equipment categories. Although these data suggest
weakness in domestic production of capital goods in the near term, the
longer-term outlook for total investment spending-including purchases of
foreign and domestically produced equipment as well as construction expendi-
tures-remains more favorable. The value of new construction commitments
was still trending upward around the turn of the year (chart). And, more
generally, surveys of anticipated spending on plant and equipment, the
latest of which is the February McGraw-Hill survey, point to an increase in
nominal outlays of about 10 percent in 1985, with especially large gains in
manufacturing.
Business Inventories
Investment in business inventories remained moderate in early 1985.
The book value of stocks at all manufacturing and trade establishments
increased at a $26 billion annual rate in January, roughly the same as in
the fourth quarter but considerably slower than the rapid rates maintained
over the first three quarters of 1984. The more moderate inventory investment
in recent months reflects not only the need for some businesses to reduce
overhangs that first emerged last fall, but also continued caution toward
inventory investment fostered by high carrying costs and competitive pressures.
Recent changes in inventories varied considerably across industries.
In the manufacturing sector, the book value of stocks fell in January for a
third month in a row, largely in response to earlier weakness in orders and
shipments. At the retail trade level, however, the book value of inventories

II-11
increased substantially in January for a second consecutive month. Roughly
two-thirds of the January accumulation occurred at auto dealers, as car
manufacturers stepped up assemblies and shipments to dealers in an effort
to alleviate tight supplies of some models. At general merchandise stores,
where stocks had been burdensome late last year, retailers managed to pare
their inventories in January, apparently through heavy discounting. Moreover,
the strong increase in retail sales reported in February probably also
helped to bring stocks and sales into better alignment.
Housing
Housing activity strengthened somewhat in early 1985. Housing starts
jumped sharply in January and then settled back to a 1.64 million unit rate
in February (chart). Issuance of residential building permits, which tends
to be less volatile than the starts series, corroborates the recent pickup
in construction activity: permit issuance during the January-February
period averaged 5 percent above the fourth-quarter pace.
Housing starts for multifamily units were particularly volatile in the
winter months, with all of January's sharp increase being reversed in
February. When averaged over this two-month period, multifamily starts were
16 percent above the fourth-quarter pace. In light of several adverse
influences on multifamily construction, including the highest average
vacancy rate for rental housing in 10 years, a large number of units in the
production pipeline, and uncertainty about potential tax law changes,
the January level appeared unsustainable.
In the single-family market, sales of existing homes posted their
third consecutive monthly gain in January, while new home sales rose 3

percent after a relatively sluggish initial response to the declines in
mortgage interest rates recorded during the last half of 1984 and in early
1985. With the improvement in sales, single-family starts generally have
trended higher since last October; in February, these starts were at a 1.12
million unit annual rate, or 7 percent above the fourth-quarter level.
House prices have continued to rise at approximately the rates observed
over the past year. Controlling for changes in quality and regional mix,
new home prices in the fourth quarter were about 5 percent above a year
earlier. Price behavior in specific markets, however, has varied considerably
from these national averages. For example, very large increases in median
prices for existing houses were reported in New York City and Boston over
the past year, while prices were flat or down in some metropolitan areas in
California, Texas, and the Midwest.
State and Local Sector
Real outlays for goods and services by state and local governments
showed virtually no growth in the fourth quarter of 1984 and apparently
remained sluggish during the first two months of this year. In January,
real outlays for construction continued to trend lower, as has been the
case since the third quarter of 1984. And, through February, employment
had dropped from its fourth-quarter level.
On the whole, the state and local sector still is enjoying a sizable
operating surplus, and some states are contemplating decreases in tax
rates, especially personal income tax rates. In particular, cuts are
expected in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New York, where effective income tax

rates are high. However, concerns about possible reductions in federal aid
to states and localities may damp enthusiasm for tax cuts.
Federal Government
The federal government recorded a deficit of $6-1/2 billion (unified
basis) in January, about $1 billion more than during the same month a year
earlier. Over the first four months of fiscal 1985, the deficit totaled
$79 billion and continued to run about $10 billion larger than it was during
the comparable period of fiscal 1984.
On the outlay side, a cost-of-living adjustment in social security
and federal retirement programs, along with general pay increases for federal
civilian and military personnel, boosted January outlays about $1 billion
($12 billion at an annual rate). On the spending side, indexation of tax
rates effective January 1 is estimated to have reduced liabilities on
personal taxes at a $9 billion annual rate, while a hike in social security
tax rates added about $6 billion (annual rate) to personal tax burdens.
January and preliminary February data also show that income tax returns
were being processed at a slower pace than in recent years.
In Congress, the Senate Budget Committee has completed markup on the
First Budget Resolution for FY1986. The Committee's decisions call for a
slowing in the growth of defense spending, a "freeze" on many domestic
programs including social security COLAs and on federal pay and pensions,
and a reduction in spending for a number of other domestic programs, but no
tax increases. According to the Committee's estimates, these actions would
reduce their baseline deficit by about $55 billion in FY1986 and approximately
$100 billion by FY1988. The House Budget Committee is expected to take
the budget within the next few weeks.

II-16
Exports and Imports
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened substantially in January,
to $21 billion at an annual rate, after declining to a $92 billion annual
rate in the fourth quarter. An increase in nonoil imports accounted for
most of the deterioration in the trade account, as imports of capital
goods, passenger cars from Europe, and consumer goods were up sharply.
Although monthly figures on nonoil imports tend to be volatile, their high
level continued to reflect the effects of the rising dollar and strong U.S.
demand. Oil imports, in contrast, have declined steadily in recent months
in both price and quantity. The volume of oil imported in January was 4.8
million barrels per day compared with an average of 5.8 million barrels per
day in the October-November period; the average price of imported oil
dropped 55 cents per barrel between November and January. Nonagricultural
exports in January remained at their somewhat improved December level.
However, agricultural shipments abroad, which had benefited from a surge in
exports to Russia in the fourth quarter, dropped back. (Further discussion
of international economic developments is included in Section IV).
Prices
Price reports have continued to be favorable early this year. The
consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in January, while the producer price
index for finished goods was unchanged in January and then fell 0.1 percent
in February.
Price weakness in petroleum markets was again a factor in holding
down the inflation rate early this year. The energy component of the CPI
was off 0.8 percent in January, the largest monthly decline in almost two
years, as gasoline and fuel oil prices fell markedly.

II-17
Retail food prices rose 0.2 percent in January, as lower
prices for livestock products partially offset increases in other categories.
At the producer level, prices for both finished and crude foods declined
for a second month in a row in February, despite sharp weather-related
increases for fresh fruits and vegetables. Further price reductions for
meats and most livestock contributed to the overall declines in the PPI
food indexes.
Outside the food and energy sectors, consumer prices rose somewhat
faster in January than during the fourth quarter. This acceleration occurred
exclusively in the commodities component and was attributable to large
price increases for cigarettes and used cars. In contrast, prices of
nonenergy services rose at the same pace as in the two preceding months and
less than the average monthly rate during 1984.
Capital equipment prices picked up in January and February, largely
reflecting higher manufacturers' prices for cars and light trucks. Never-
theless, the PPI index for capital equipment still is only 2-1/4 percent
above its level a year ago. At earlier stages of processing, the index for
intermediate materials less food and energy continued to be relatively
flat, and prices of crude nonfood nonenergy materials fell substantially
further.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage inflation in the private economy leveled off in late 1984 and
early 1985. The hourly earnings index for production and nonsupervisory
workers rose 0.6 percent in February, after a decline the month before.

II-19
Although volatile on a monthly basis, the 12-month change in this wage
measure has fluctuated around the 3 percent mark since last autumn. Average
wage adjustments in manufacturing have risen somewhat more in recent months
than they did earlier in the recovery when many union workers negotiated
new contracts with initial wage cuts and freezes. Some of the step up
lately may be attributable to the reduced incidence of cuts and freeze
in the manufacturing sector, as profits generally have improved. Meanwhile,
changes in the wage indexes for services and transportation and public
utilities have been quite moderate, on average, over the past several
months.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose nearly 3 percent at
an annual rate during the fourth quarter of 1984 after a 1 percent decline
in the preceding quarter. Over the four quarters of the year, productivity
was up 2-1/2 percent, compared with the strong, cyclical rebound of nearly
4 percent in 1983. Rising productivity coupled with a moderate increase in
hourly compensation held the increase in unit labor costs to less than 2
percent last year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1 growth strengthened in February, probably still boosted by pre-
vious declines in interest rates, bringing this aggregate near the upper
parallel band associated with its 1985 target range. Growth of the broader
monetary aggregates, on the other hand, slowed in February, as spreads
between market interest rates and rates on retail deposits and money funds
widened.
Since the FOMC meeting in mid-February, federal funds have traded
primarily between 8-1/2 and 8-3/4 percent, somewhat above the prevailing
level earlier in the year. Other market interest rates rose more markedly
during February, as the strength of M1, combined with indications of
tautness in reserve markets, apparently aroused concerns that System policy
had become or was about to become less accommodative. More recently, these
interest rates have fluctuated in response to incoming data on the strength
of economic activity, which have given mixed signals. On balance, yields
on Treasury securities have risen throughout the maturity spectrum since
the February FOMC meeting, by 30 to 75 basis points, and the yield curve
has remained quite steep. Yields on corporate obligations generally have
increased in line with those on Treasury securities, while yields on tax-
exempt securities have risen less. New commitment rates for conventional
home mortgages, after declining in early February, have begun to rise as well.
The collapse in early March of E.S.M. Government Securities, a non-
primary, monthly-reporting dealer, and the subsequent closing of privately
insured savings and loan associations in Ohio appear not to have signifi-
cantly affected domestic financial markets. Apart from the privately
insured S&Ls in Ohio, depository institutions apparently have not encountered

liquidity problems. Some Treasury bill rates dropped sharply after the
announcement of the closing of the Ohio thrifts, but on balance yield
spreads between bank CDs and Treasury bills and between federal funds and
RPs have widened only marginally.
Borrowing by nonfinancial sectors in the first two months of the year
seems to have moderated relative to the fourth quarter of 1984. Business
credit demands appear to have fallen off considerably from the strong
fourth-quarter pace, despite a likely widening of the financing gap in
the first quarter and continued net retirements of equity. In addition,
offerings of tax-exempt bonds have declined by one-third from the record
volume brought to market in the fourth quarter. And although the Treasury
continues to place very large demands on financial markets, its borrowing
too has been significantly below the fourth-quarter level. Only in the
household sector does the growth of aggregate credit demands appear to have
remained close to the late-1984 pace.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Ml growth surged in February to a 14 percent annual rate, with all
of its components contributing to this strength. Inflows to Super NOW
accounts remained substantial, probably boosted by the January reduction
in regulatory minimum balance requirements; however, this does not appear
to have had a significant effect on M1 growth, as the primary source of
Super NOW inflows seems to have been ordinary NOW accounts. The continued
strength of M in recent months points toward a decline in velocity in the
first quarter as a whole, which probably is at least in part a lagged reaction
to the drop in interest rates over the fall and early winter.

III-4
In contrast to M, growth in the broader aggregates moderated in
February. M2 decelerated to a 10-1/2 percent pace, as growth in MMDAs and
M2-type money funds slowed and runoffs of small time deposits quickened.
The weakening of these components likely reflects changing yield relation-
ships. When market rates declined last fall and early winter, yields on
money funds, MMDAs, and small time deposits responded sluggishly, resulting
in strong inflows into these accounts, particularly to MMDAs and money
funds, whose yields became most favorable relative to market counterparts.
However, a further downward adjustment of these yields, followed by the
recent upturn in market rates, has tended to reverse this trend. The
slowdown in M2 growth in February was tempered by a record increase in
overnight RPs and a rare increase in savings deposits. The surge in RPs
financed substantial acquisitions of Treasury securities by bank security
dealers.
M3 growth slowed to an 8 percent annual pace in February, as the
level of its non-M2 component contracted a bit for the second straight
month. The February decline was concentrated in institution-only money
funds, which registered outflows following the restoration of a positive
spread between market rates and money fund yields. In addition, growth of
large time deposits at thrift institutions virtually ceased, owing both to
slower asset growth and increased reliance on Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)
advances. Asset growth of FSLIC-insured institutions apparently is being
restrained by the implementation of new capital requirements for these

III-5
institutions by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.1 Outstanding FHLB advances
increased $2-1/2 billion in February, perhaps reflecting an effort by some
thrifts to lengthen maturities of managed liabilities; the average maturity
of advances in recent months generally has exceeded 13 months. In contrast
to thrift institutions, commercial banks resumed issuance of large time
deposits and term RPs in February after runoffs of these liabilities in
January, as core deposit growth slowed while credit growth picked up.
Credit growth at commercial banks in February increased to a 13 per-
cent annual rate, more than double the January pace. Strength was evident
in both the security and loan components. Heavy acquisitions of U.S. govern-
ment securities more than offset a runoff in holdings of other securities.
The pickup in loan growth was accounted for by business loans and real
estate loans. To a large degree, the strength in business loans appears to
have reflected an increase in the share of business loans booked at domestic
offices rather than at foreign branches, as the spread between the prime
and LIBOR narrowed by about 100 basis points in February. Nonetheless, the
sum of business loans at domestic offices plus foreign branch loans grew at
a 6-1/2 percent rate in February, somewhat faster than the average rate
in the previous two months. Growth in consumer loans slowed for the second
straight month.
1. On January 1, FSLIC-insured institutions became subject to new incre-
mental requirements on minimum net worth, the size of which are based on
their rate of growth. In addition, those institutions with assets exceed-
ing $100 million now must have regulatory approval to grow in excess of a
25 percent annual rate over two consecutive quarters. In January, total
assets of FSLIC-insured institutions were virtually unchanged, compared
with a monthly average increase of over $12 billion in the fourth quarter
of 1984.

The rebound in business lending by commercial banks was accompanied
by a resumption of heavy commercial paper issuance in February after the
sharp runoff in January. After contracting in January, the sum of bank
loans and commercial paper expanded at about a 10-1/2 percent annual rate
in February, still somewhat below the fourth-quarter pace.
Business Finance
Overall credit demands of nonfinancial firms strengthened in February
from January's sluggish pace, as the surge in borrowing from banks and in
the commercial paper market more than offset a decline in bond issuance.
New issues by nonfinancial firms in the domestic bond market were essenti-
ally unchanged from the previous month, but Eurobond offerings dropped back
after a bulge in January.
Taking the first two months of the year together, the volume of funds
raised in financial markets by nonfinancial corporations appears to have
fallen off considerably from the fourth-quarter pace, despite a likely
widening of the financing gap in the current quarter. Borrowing from banks
and in the commercial paper market grew at only one-third the rate of the
fourth quarter, while in long-term markets total bond offerings-here and
abroad-by nonfinancial firms were only about two-thirds the average monthly
volume in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, net retirements of equity-reflect-
ing mergers and other financial restructurings--have continued sizable. A
$4-1/2 billion swap of debt for common stock and a $1/2 billion repurchase
of shares from the Pickens group by Phillips Petroleum are expected to take
place in late March.
Total bond offerings by U.S. corporations-financial and nonfinan-
cial--declined sharply in February from the strong January pace. Eurobond

volume dropped by half, and total bond issuance by financial firms fell by
more than half. Offerings in the Eurobond market last month apparently
were held down by a large buildup of unsold issues at underwriters following
the very aggressive pricing of a record volume of offerings in January.
Bank holding companies accounted for much of the reduction in total bond
issuance by financial corporations, as a number of institutions approached
regulatory limits on the amount of mandatory convertible debt that can be
counted as primary capital for purposes of regulatory minimum capital
guidelines.1 Total bond issuance by U.S. corporations is expected to bal-
loon in March, bolstered by the Phillips restructuring; apart from this
transaction, bond offerings thus far in March are running close to the
pace in February.
Several stock price indexes reached record highs in early February,
before weakening with the backup in market interest rates, and equity
issuance picked up a bit. Even so, equity issuance through the first two
months of the year remained at around the lackluster average pace of 1984,
despite the strong performance, on balance, of stock prices thus far in
1985.
Government Finance
Federal sector. The staff is now projecting a combined (on- and

deficit has been reduced by as much as $5 billion by a slower-than-normal

about $40 billion, net, from the public and by reducing its cash balance
by about $8 billion, leaving an end-of-quarter balance of $9-1/2 billion.
Continuing the pattern of recent quarters, the Treasury will raise the
bulk of its new money in auctions of marketable coupons. Bill financing
is expected to total only $5 billion, with a cash management bill that the
Treasury had expected to be needed in March now likely to be deferred until
early April.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies is declining in
the first quarter from the already low level in the final quarter of last
year. Federal Home Loan Banks are borrowing relatively small amounts in
the current quarter, as advances to thrifts have been financed largely by
drawing down liquid assets. The FHLBs continue to hold a relatively large
volume of liquid assets and thus are not expected to tap the financial
markets for new funds in the near term. Borrowing by the Federal National
Mortgage Association moderated in the first quarter, but remains sizable.
FNMA's rapid growth reflects, in part, an effort to reduce the rate sensi-
tivity of its portfolio by adding adjustable-rate mortgages.
The Farm Credit Banks will reduce their outstanding debt in the
first quarter by the same amount as in the preceding quarter. Borrowing
by these institutions generally has been weak since 1982, but the recent
cutback in debt has been the sharpest over this period and coincides with
a decline in the demand for loans by the agricultural sector. With heavy
debt burdens and declining land values, farmers have been increasing their
outstanding debt only slightly.
Thus far, the stress in the farm sector has had a limited effect on
the financial condition of the Farm Credit System. A few of the local

III-12
cooperative associations that lend directly to farmers have been liquidated
and three of the 37 Farm Credit Banks have reported financial difficulty.1
However, the losses of these three banks can be covered by the others in
the System. For 1984, the System recently reported aggregate net income of
$442 million, compared with $543 million in 1983, and its capital position
is strong. Recent issues of securities by the System have not carried
additional risk premiums. There have been reports that some investors are
attempting to pare their holdings of these securities, but the paydown of
debt by the System apparently has been sufficient to offset the selling
pressure from those investors liquidating their holdings.
State and local sector. Issuance of tax-exempt bonds increased in
February to $9.5 billion but seems to be dropping back this month to about
the comparatively low $6.7 billion pace of January. Not only have offerings
of long-term tax-exempts remained well below the record volume in the
fourth quarter, but offerings of short-term tax-exempt notes also have
remained light. Interest rates on tax-exempt bonds have increased substan-
tially after reaching their lowest level since the spring of 1983 during
the third week of January.
The supply of new tax-exempt issues in February was augmented by a
surge of refunding bonds. Many states sold general obligation bonds for
this purpose and two publicly owned utilities brought large refunding issues
to the market. The total volume of refundings was nearly $2 billion, its
highest level since the spring of 1983.

On the demand side, households and mutual funds have continued to
be the major investors in tax-exempt bonds. There is some evidence of
increased participation by commercial banks, primarily in shorter-term
markets, but property/casualty companies, once heavy participants in
the municipal market, have remained inactive, given record underwriting
losses. Individuals' demand for municipal securities has been supported
by the increasing use of guarantees of various types. In 1984, about 21
percent of long-term municipal securities was protected with private in-
surance, compared with 15 percent in 1983, and less than 4 percent as
recently as 1980. Until 1983, AMBAC Indemnity Corporation and the Municipal
Bond Insurance Association provided most of the insurance for tax-exempt
bonds, but more recently two new firms have entered the market.

Mortgage Markets
Rates on new commitments for home mortgages have turned up since the
last FOMC meeting in both the primary and the secondary markets. At S&Ls,
contract interest rates for conventional fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) aver-
aged 13.20 percent by mid-March, up 30 basis points from the latest low
in mid-February but still about 150 basis points below last July's high.
Initial contract rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) at the
same institutions have increased on balance by a similar amount.
Through early February, closing rates on both FRMs and ARMs had
continued to move down, but the cumulative declines in closing rates since
last autumn had been much smaller than cumulative declines in rates on new
commitments. For FRMs and ARMs combined, average contract rates at closing
were off by only 57 basis points from last October's high. In part, the
downtrend in the average closing rate on all conventional loans has been
moderated by a shift in the composition of lending toward FRMs and away
from ARMs that carry lower initial rates.1 Of all conventional mortgages
closed in early February, 46 percent carried adjustable-rate features--
sharply below last October's near-record high of 64 percent and the lowest
proportion since late 1983.
Available evidence on demands for new mortgage credit early this year
has been mixed. Net borrowing from commercial banks on all types of real
estate picked up sharply in February from the reduced January pace, but on

a promotional incentive-has apparently diminished considerably since last
fall, judging from staff estimates based on FHLBB data through early
February.

balance real estate lending during those two months was in line with that
in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the surge in real estate loans in February
occurred at large banks, where home mortgages historically have accounted
for less than half of total real estate loans.
At FSLIC-insured institutions-the largest mortgage originator group--
new mortgage loans closed (for both construction and permanent financing)
increased in January at slightly above the fourth-quarter average rate;
however, with loan retirements at an all-time high, the volume of net
lending remained below its late-1984 average pace. The industry also ran
off holdings of mortgage-backed securities. Meanwhile, new commitments
dropped in January to the lowest volume since last September, reflecting
a large cutback in purchase commitments that more than offset a small
increase in origination commitments. With originations higher and purchases
unchanged, mortgage loan commitments outstanding declined to the lowest
level since last spring. Issuance of federally guaranteed mortgage-backed
securities strengthened during February as swap volume picked up to near
its fourth-quarter average.
Consumer Credit
Growth of consumer credit in the first two months of the year
appears to have remained substantial, associated with continued strength
in sales of autos and other consumer goods, as well as a further downward
drift, at least through early February, in consumer finance rates. According
to the revised series, outstanding consumer installment debt increased at a
19 percent annual rate in January, up a bit from the 18-1/2 percent December
pace. Consumer loan growth at commrcial banks slowed in February, but may
have been restrained by the introduction of concessionary financing for

certain automobile loans at the captive finance companies. Growth of
installment credit in January was especially brisk in the automotive and
revolving credit categories.
Costs of most types of consumer credit continued to drift down
through early February. At commercial banks, the most common rate on 48-
month new auto loans dropped 54 basis points between early November and
early February, reaching 13.37 percent. Rates on closed-end personal
consumer credit also declined by about 40 basis points over the three-month
period, but rates on bank credit card plans continued to edge up to a
record 18.85 percent. Rate concessions on small cars offered by AMC,
Chrysler, and Ford dealers are scheduled to remain in effect until various
dates from the end of March through the end of April.
Household Financial Positions
The increase in net consumer installment debt in January brought the
debt-to-income ratio to 17-1/4 percent, up from about 14-1/2 percent in
late 1982, but still below the late 1979 peak of 17-3/4 percent. Never-
theless, the debt burden suggested by this measure does not appear to be
excessive, judging from other indications such as personal bankruptcies and
delinquencies on such debt. Personal bankruptcy filings have shown no
tendency to increase for the last year and a half and are substantially
under the highs partly induced by the 1980 statutory changes. The
percent of installment loans 30 days or more past due at both commercial
banks and finance companies increased at the end of last year, but it
remained well below the highs reached in 1980 and below the average levels
of the 1970s; indeed, the finance company rate remained near its historic
low achieved last year.

III-20
On longer-term home mortgage debt, though, the most recent data
suggest that delinquency rates stand at historic highs. According to the
Mortgage Bankers Association, the delinquency rate on all mortgages 60 days
or more past due edged up to a record 1.88 percent in the fourth quarter.
In January, the corresponding rate at savings and loan associations also
increased, to a record 2.38 percent. The runup in mortgage delinquencies
appears to be due, in part, to the sharp slowing in the rate of increase of
home prices since the last recession. In addition, trade sources suggest
that delinquencies have been increasing on ARMs that had been made with
substantial first-year interest rate discounts.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted average value of the dollar has declined about
3/4 percent on balance since the last FOMC meeting. The dollar was very
strong early in the intermeeting period, but it dropped back sharply late
in the period amid shifting assessments of the strength of U.S. economic
activity and the stance of U.S. monetary policy. The exceptional
volatility of exchange-rate movements also has reflected varying market
concern about possible concerted intervention against the dollar,
The dollar appreciated 5 percent over the first two weeks of the
intermeeting period, boosted by unexpectedly strong data on U.S. economic
activity, together with a market perception that the Federal Reserve
might have begun to tighten reserve conditions, while the Bundesbank
continued to supply liquidity to the German interbank market at terms and
in volume viewed as generous. Another factor cited in the dollar's
advance was President Reagan's criticism of artificial attempts to
depress the dollar, which reportedly alleviated market concern that the
United States might participate vigorously in coordinated intervention
efforts.
The dollar eased somewhat on Tuesday, February 26.

.Over the next two days,
additional favorable data on the U.S. economy helped the dollar rebound
from Wednesday's low
.In addition, the Desk purchased $257.5 million equivalent of
marks over three days,
.Desk activity was noted in the market, but was perceived as
moderate. Including an operation in mid-February, the Desk's dollar
sales for the intermeeting period totalled $322.5 million divided equally
between the accounts of the System and the Treasury, with $306.1 million
sold for marks and $16.4 million for sterling.
Over the remainder of the intermeeting period,
, the dollar quickly recovered almost to its
late-February peak, but trading conditions continued to be volatile with
market participants wary of central bank action. The dollar subsequently
weakened as new data on U.S. economic activity disappointed market expec-
tations, and as some market participants conjectured that problems at
state-insured thrift institutions in Ohio might induce the Federal
Reserve to maintain an easier stance than it otherwise would. The
dollar's slide turned into a steep drop as an increasing number of
participants expressed the view that fundamental imbalances in the U.S.
economy might at last be bringing a long-expected reversal of the
dollar's protracted rise.

IV-4
As illustrated in the bottom panel of the chart, the dollar has
depreciated 2-1/4 percent against the yen and nearly 5 percent vis-a-vis
sterling over the intermeeting period. Sterling, notably, benefitted
from high U.K. interest rates, from a firming of spot prices for
Britain's North Sea oil, and from the ending of the year-long strike by
British coal miners. The pound recovered 4 percent on a trade-weighted
basis. Its recovery contributed to an easing of sterling interest rates
late in the period. Major U.K. banks cut their base lending rates 1/2
percentage point to 13-1/2 percent, and the Bank of England made similar
reductions in its money-market dealing rates.
The Canadian currency has depreciated sharply against the dollar,
dropping 2-1/2 percent on balance since the last FOMC meeting. The
Canadian dollar's recent weakness reflects several factors: a market
perception that political conflict in Canada may inhibit fiscal
retrenchment and reform of regulations governing foreign investment; an
anticipated slowing of economic growth; and a belief that with
unemployment still high and capital formation weak, Canadian authorities
might resist increases in interest rates despite exchange-rate pressures.
Nonetheless, short-term Canadian interest rates have risen steeply, and
major Canadian banks recently raised their prime rates 1/4 percentage
point to 11-1/2 percent.

IV-5
Notable among the EMS currencies is the Italian lira, which has
depreciated 2-1/2 percent against the dollar and has dropped from near
the top of the EMS to the bottom. Italy's trade deficit, which
established a record in 1984 and remained large in January, reportedly
has engendered speculation that the lira's parities against other EMS
currencies may have to be adjusted downward. It is unclear why
expectations of a realignment should have materialized so abruptly.

IV-6
U.S. banks' foreign lending in the fourth quarter. U.S.-chartered
banks' gross claims on foreigners declined a slight $2 billion in the
fourth quarter. The changes in claims on the various country groups
were all less than $1 billion except for a $2.5 billion (7 percent) drop
in claims on smaller developed countries. Claims on non-OPEC developing
countries again showed little movement. In this group, claims on Brazil
were unchanged and claims on Mexico fell $0.3 billion even though U.S.
banks disbursed about $300 million to Brazil and $350 million to Mexico
when those countries drew further on bank term loans signed in the
spring of 1984.
1984 was a year of sharp contraction in U.S. banks' claims on
foreigners that was motivated primarily by the banks' desire to improve
capital/asset ratios through a reduction in interbank placements as well
as by a decline in the relative attractiveness of lending to developing
countries and Eastern Europe. The decrease for the year of nearly $30
billion (7 percent) followed a year of virtually no net change in 1983,
of moderate (6 percent) expansion in 1982, and of growth in the years
1976-81 averaging 17 percent annually. Of the 1984 decline, $11-12
billion can be accounted for by the valuation effect of the higher
foreign exchange value of the dollar on the foreign branches' non-dollar
claims. The dollar rose 12 percent, on a weighted average multilateral
trade basis, from December 1983 to December 1984. About two-thirds of
the nominal decrease in the dollar value of total claims in 1984
occurred in the third quarter, when the dollar appreciated by eight
percent. After adjustment for exchange rate changes, almost all the
decline in total claims was in interbank placements.

More than $20 billion of the 1984 reduction in claims was on the
G-10 countries, and consisted largely of cut-backs in interbank place-
ments. Small declines were shown in claims on most other groups, while
claims on non-OPEC developing countries were essentially unchanged. As
shown in Table 2, for almost all the principal borrowers in this group
the change for the year was small and negative. The main exception was
Brazil. U.S. bank claims on Brazil rose $3.2 billion, of which about
$1.9 billion reflected disbursement of the U.S. banks' share (about 40
percent) of Brazilian drawings on the $6.5 billion new money loan from
the banks signed in March. Claims on Mexico declined slightly despite
disbursements of the U.S. banks' share of about $1.1 billion under the
$3.8 billion new money loan signed in April; the decline appears to have
reflected repayments of debts of private Mexican borrowers and perhaps
some write-offs of by banks private-sector debts.

IV-9
U.S. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
Large net capital inflows through several channels were
recorded in 1984. (See the Summary table of U.S. International
Transactions.) Substantial inflows of capital included unprecedented
net foreign private purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, sizeable
net foreign private purchases of U.S. corporate bonds, and large net
inflows reported by banks.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities totaled more
than $22 billion in 1984. One development which contributed to the
large foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities was the
Treasury's introduction in October and December of two $1 billion
issues of securities targeted for purchase by foreigners. At the time
of the first issue in October the price of the foreign targeted
instrument was above that of the domestic companion issue. Later
quotations in the secondary market, however, indicate this premium has
declined and even reversed. While this development may signal that
market participants do not place great value on the degree of
anonymity provided by the foreign targeted issue it may also derive
from other differences between the two securities, in particular
differences in the size of the secondary markets. An investor may
demand a higher yield on the foreign targeted issue to compensate for
the relatively greater uncertainty associated with disposition of the
foreign targeted security prior to its maturity.
While the foreign targeted issue may offer a higher yield to
compensate for secondary market asymmetries, the extent of the yield
differential is limited by the provision that a foreign targeted issue

may be converted into its domestic companion at any time beyond 45
days after the date of auction. The Treasury reports that
approximately 25 percent of the foreign targeted securities which have
been issued have subsequently been converted into the domestic
companion securities. This development may in turn increase the
relative uncertainty of dealing in the secondary market for foreign
targeted securities as the total stock of these securities outstanding
diminishes.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds totaled $13.7
billion in 1984, sharply higher than in 1983 [line 2a]. Much of the
increase occurred in the fourth quarter of 1984 when a $10.1 billion
net inflow was recorded. Legislation to repeal the withholding tax on
interest payments to foreigners at mid-year and the clarification of
the TEFRA (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982)
regulations in late August resulted in a shift in location for the
issue of Eurobonds by U.S. corporations from the Netherlands Antilles
to the United States. Previously, the proceeds of Eurobond sales,
when repatriated to the United States, were recorded as a reduction in
U.S. direct investment abroad, (line 6) rather than as foreign net
purchases of U.S. corporate securities.
Eurobond issuance by U.S. corporations was strong through
January of 1985, but there are some signs of a slowdown in activity.
Several forces may combine to diminish the issuance of Eurobonds.
First, increased underwriting competition in recent months appears to
have eroded profit margins and there has been a large buildup of
underwriters' inventories. In the absence of expectations that
interest rates will fall many underwriters may be reluctant to

IV-12
participate vigorously. Second, in recent months, many large U.S. bank
holding companies have issued large amounts of mandatory convertible
securities in the Euromarkets to augment their primary capital, but several
of the large bank holding companies have reached, or are approaching, the
limit on the amounts raised in this manner that can be counted as capital
for regulatory purposes. Finally, the decision of the Japanese government
to eliminate the foreign withholding tax on European bond issues by
Japanese companies as of April 1, removes an incentive for U.S. and
Japanese firms to issue yen and dollar bonds, respectively, in the
Euromarkets and then swap the payments obligations.
Turning now to other capital flows, banking offices in the United
States recorded a large net inflow in January, more than offsetting the
outflow at the end of 1984. Foreign official holdings in the U.S. fell by
$4.1 billion in January of 1985, in part due to a $1.0 billion decline in
the holdings of Latin American countries. Partial data from FRBNY for
February indicates that official reserve assets in the United States fell
substantially

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In January, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit increased from a
relatively low December rate; exports (other than agricultural
shipments) continued at relatively strong December levels, and imports
(other than oil) turned up after several low months.
The strength of nonagricultural exports in January, as in
December, was primarily in machinery (particularly office machines and
other electronic items) and in passenger car exports to Canada.
Industrial supplies contributed a smaller part of the recent strength.
Agricultural exports in January, especially wheat and soybeans, dropped
off from rates recorded in the fourth quarter; fourth-quarter shipments
had benefited from a surge in exports of grain to the U.S.S.R.

The rise in imports in January followed a decline in December.
Month-to-month movements in nonoil imports are very erratic. However,
by averaging monthly developments, it appears that following a strong
surge in imports in the middle of the year (April through September),
imports eased in the fourth quarter, as did U.S. domestic demand. In
January, nonoil imports increased from relatively low fourth-quarter
rates. The rise in nonoil imports in January appears to have been
generally in capital goods (particularly office machines and other
electronic equipment), in passenger cars from Europe, and some
industrial supplies such as steel and textiles.
Oil imports have declined steadily in recent months in both
price and volume. The volume of oil imported in January was 4.8
million barrels per day compared with 5.1 mbd in December and an
average of 5.8 mbd in the October-November period; between November and
January, the average price of imported oil dropped by about 55 cents
per barrel.

U.S. Current Account in 1984
For the year 1984, the U.S. current account balance was in deficit by
$102 billion; this compares with a deficit of $42 billion for the year
earlier. About three-fourths of the increase in the deficit was attributable
to merchandise trade -- imports expanded faster than exports rose. In
addition, net investment income receipts were reduced in 1984, largely a
result of interest payments on liabilities to foreigners increasing faster
than interest receipts from U.S. claims on foreigners; net direct investment
income receipts were also somewhat less in 1984 than in 1983. A reduction
in exports of military goods and services, increased U.S. payments for other
services (travel abroad, transportation costs, etc.), and increased unilateral
transfers (importantly government grants) also contributed to the widening of
the current account deficit in 1984.

IV-18
Foreign Economic Developments. Economic activity in the major
foreign industrial countries has continued to expand, but only Japan
has experienced robust growth. Growth in Japan accelerated markedly in
the fourth quarter of 1984, in large part owing to increases in net
exports and spending on plant and equipment. Growth of real gross
national product in the fourth quarter slowed in Germany, France, and
Canada. Industrial production has declined in recent months in Japan
and Continental Europe, while it remained relatively unchanged in the
Canada and and rose in the United Kingdom. The unusually cold winter
in Europe may have contributed somewhat to the recent decline in
output.
Unemployment remains at historically high rates in all countries,
with recent data indicating slightly higher unemployment in Germany,
France, the United Kingdom, and Italy than at the beginning of 1984.
Unemployment has been slightly lower than a year ago only in Japan and
Canada. Inflation abroad remains low, although there is some
indication that further reductions in some countries' rates may be
difficult to achieve this year.
Record trade and current account surpluses were registered by
Japan and Canada in 1984, while the United Kingdom's trade deficit
narrowed in the most recent data. Germany continued to be in surplus
on current account in January, and France's trade deficit in 1984 was
much less than in 1983. Italy experienced an increase in its trade
deficit in January.

IV-22
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, real GNP last year rose by
6.3 percent on a Q4/Q4 basis, the highest rate of growth since 1972.
Domestic demand rose by 3.8 percent, compared with a 2.5 percent
increase in 1983. Real growth in the fourth quarter accelerated to
9-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.) from a downward revised 2-1/2 percent in the
third quarter. A large part of the acceleration in the fourth quarter
can be attributed to the external sector. Exports rose, while imports
slowed from the advanced pace of the third quarter. More recent
indicators of activity are mixed. Industrial production declined in
December and January after a total increase of 3-1/2 percent during
October and November. On the other hand, an Economic Planning Agency
survey in December shows strong investment plans for the first half of
this year by major corporations. Also, department store sales and
sales of passenger cars point to stronger consumer spending.
Inflation in Japan remains low. The Tokyo consumer price
index in the first two months of this year was about 2-1/2 percent
above that of a year earlier. Large surpluses continue to be seen in
the external accounts. In the three-month period ending in January,
the trade and current accounts showed record surpluses of $56 billion
and $49 billion (s.a.a.r.), respectively.
In the face of such large external surpluses, the Japanese
government has become increasingly concerned about foreign perceptions
that its policies are protectionist. The United States, for one, is
seeking to make the Japanese market more open. Sector specific trade
talks are being held in the areas of telecommunications, forest

IV-23
products, electronics, and pharamaceuticals and medical equipment. The
first area is the most urgent as the Japanese government is now
drafting regulations and technical standards in association with the
April 1 deregulation of the telecommunications industry. There is
concern that these regulations will be drafted so as to inhibit foreign
competition. There is also reason to believe that the Japanese will
show some restraint on promoting exports. In particular, after the
elimination of the voluntary export restraints on automobiles, many
observers expect that the Japanese government will attempt to regulate
the increase in such exports to the United States.
Real gross national product in Germany grew by 2.9 percent from
the fourth quarter of 1983 to that of 1984. Growth decelerated at the
end of 1984. Industrial production in Germany fell 2 percent in
January to a level only slightly higher than in January 1984.
Unusually severe winter weather, which depressed construction activity
in particular, was an important factor in this setback. However, the
volume of orders continued to grow in January, suggesting that the lull
in production activity may have been temporary. The seasonally
adjusted rate of unemployment was unchanged at 9.2 percent in
February.
Although the consumer price index rose only 2.3 percent in the
twelve months preceding February, it accelerated in January and
February to an annual rate of increase of about 6 percent (n.s.a.), in
part reflecting seasonal factors. Import prices have been rising
rapidly with the recent strength of the dollar against the mark.

IV-24
Wholesale and producers prices in January are also showing some
acceleration.
The current account showed a small surplus in the month of
January. German exports to the United States and Canada rose by 42
percent in 1984, whereas imports rose by 13 percent. North America's
share of total German exports rose from 8 percent in 1983 to 10.5
percent in 1984. The increase in exports to North America in 1984
amounts to about 1-1/4 percent of German nominal gross national
product.
By the third week in March, short-term market interest rates were
once again above the Lombard rate, which had been raised to 6 percent
on February 1 for the stated purpose of keeping that rate above market
rates. The Bundesbank's infusions of liquidity necessary to keep
market rates low in February and early March were probably inconsistent
with the Central Bank Money target for 1985. Central Bank Money growth
for January was well above the 5 percent upper limit of the target.
Economic activity in France has remained weak in recent months.
Industrial production declined by 3.9 percent (s.a.) in total in
December and January and was 4.5 percent below its level of a year ago.
Real growth of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter fell to 1.4
percent (s.a.a.r.), and the increase from the fourth quarter of 1983
was only 1.9 percent. The unemployment rate rose a further 0.1
percentage point in January to 10.6 percent (s.a.).
Consumer prices increased by 0.5 percent (n.s.a.) in February as
the year-over-year inflation rate declined further to 6.4 percent. The

IV-25
government announced that public sector wage increases would be limited
to 3-1/2 percent in 1985, in line with the government's inflation
target of 4-1/2 percent.
The targeted monetary aggregate M2R declined for the second
consecutive month in November, reducing its growth rate in 1984 to only
4.2 percent (s.a.a.r.), below the lower bound of its 5-1/2 percent to
6-1/2 percent target range for 1984.
The trade deficit in January was $400 million (s.a.) after a $60
million deficit in December. For 1984 as a whole, trade was in deficit
by $2.6 billion, less than half the $5.9 billion deficit of the
previous year.
According to provisional data, real gross domestic product
(output measure) in the United Kingdom grew 4.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
the fourth quarter to achieve a growth rate of 2.1 percent on a Q4/Q4
basis. Despite the depressing influence of the coal miners' strike,
the industrial production index rose 1.3 percent (s.a.) in January to
reach the highest level since January 1980. The year long strike ended
on March 4, 1985, when the National Union of Mineworkers voted to
return to work without reaching agreement with the National Coal Board
over the closure of loss-making pits. At the time of the vote, over
half the miners were ignoring the strike call. Although some union
leaders have threatened to wage some sort of unspecified "guerilla
warfare" until the issues leading to the strike are resolved, the
credibility of this threat is uncertain. A resumption of normal
coal production would add an estimated 1 percent to measured gross
domestic product this year.

IV-26
The unemployment rate rose slightly to 13 percent (s.a.) in
February. The retail price index in January was 5 percent above its
year-earlier level, an annual rate of increase similar to that pre-
vailing for most of 1984. The monthly trade deficit narrowed from $400
million (s.a.) in December to $90 million (s.a.) in January as a result
of lower imports. After being in near balance in 1984, the monthly
current account in January was in surplus by $360 million (s.a.).
The U.K. government budget proposals for fiscal year 1985/86 have
just been presented to Parliament. The new targets for money growth
during the fourteen months from February 1985 to April 1986 are:
sterling M3, 5 to 9 percent (a.r.); and MO (the monetary base), 3 to 7
percent (a.r.). These ranges are slight reductions from the 1984/85
targets; through January, sterling M3 is just above the top of its
current target range, while MD is near the middle. Only slight changes
have been proposed for taxes and expenditures. The tax measures
include increases in the real value of personal exemption amounts,
higher excise taxes for some goods (for example beer, wine, and
cigarettes), and some extension of the indexing provisions that apply
to capital gains. As of October 1985, employment tax reforms will
lower the effective rate levied on low incomes and raise that on the
high incomes. The net effect of the measures is forecast to be a
public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of £7 billion (2 percent
of GDP). Expenditure overruns and expenses associated with the
prolonged strike by coal miners resulted in the PSBR for this fiscal
year rising to £10.5 billion (3-1/4 percent of GDP).

IV-27
Following the release of the budget message, Bank of England
official money market dealing rates were cut by one-half percentage
point. At the same time, major London clearing banks announced
reductions in their base lending rates from 14 to 13.5 percent.
Canadian gross national product increased at an annual rate of
2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1984, slower than the third
quarter increase. On a Q4/Q4 basis, growth was 3.7 percent. Almost 95
percent of the increase in gross national product was accounted for by
increases in consumption expenditure and a record trade surplus. Total
real investment expenditure increased slightly and by year end was 13
percent below the peak average quarterly pace reached in 1981. The
unemployment rate in February was in 11.0 percent up from December's
10.8 percent. The unemployment rate has been at or above 11 percent
for 29 of the last 31 months.
Inflation continued to be moderate. Consumer prices were 3.7
percent higher in January than they had been a year earlier. In
addition, the industry selling price index was only 3.3 percent higher
than a year earlier, compared with an annual rise of 3.6 percent in
December. The trade surplus in 1984 was a record $16.1 billion,
compared with a surplus of $14.4 billion in 1983. More recently, the
trade surplus was $1.12 billion in January up slightly from December's
$1.08 billion. The current account showed a surplus of $1.6 billion in
1984, compared with a surplus of $1.4 billion in 1983.
The recovery in Italy continued at a moderate pace at the end of
1984. Industrial production was 1.6 percent higher in the fourth

IV-28
quarter of 1984 than in that of 1983, but it has still not reached the
peak achieved in April 1980. The year-over-year rate of inflation as
measured by the consumer price index in February was 8.6 percent. This
rate has stopped coming down in the last three months, and there is
some concern that the government's official goal of a 7 percent rate
for the end of this year may be unattainable. Still, the official
January household survey shows that consumers have increased confidence
in the general economic situation of the country.
The trade deficit in 1984 was $10.5 billion (s.a.), a greater
deficit than that of $7.8 billion (s.a.) in 1983; the January trade
deficit was more than $1.3 billion (s.a.). In recent weeks, the lira
has been depreciating against the mark and the ECU, while the mark has
been falling against the dollar. This depreciation of the lira is a
reversal of the situation of the last year, and some analysts feel that
the market has been reacting according to expectations of a devaluation
of the lira within the European Monetary System.
The Swedish government imposed an indefinite general price freeze
effective March 6. The freeze was introduced to keep inflation within
the government's 3 percent target for 1985. Imports of goods and
intermediate inputs are exempt from the freeze, which could be lifted
if firms pledged not to raise prices beyond what the government
considers appropriate. A price freeze had been imposed from April 17,
1984, to July 1, 1984; in spite of that freeze, prices in 1984 rose by
8.2 percent, more than twice the government's target of 4 percent. In
January, consumer prices were 7.3 percent higher than a year earlier.

IV-29
Debt Situation in Selected Developing Countries
In Mexico, the rate of crawl of the peso was increased on March 6
from 17 to 21 centavos per day. If this rate of crawl is maintained
until the end of 1985, the peso price of the dollar at year-end will be
about 38 percent higher than a year earlier. However, most observers
expect the Mexican rate of inflation on a December-to-December basis to
be 45-50 percent. The rates of interest on time deposits, which had
remained unchanged since mid-November and had turned negative in real
terms as inflation rose, were increased sharply on March 11 so as to
restore positive real yields. Earlier, the authorities announced cuts
in public sector spending amounting to 1.4 percent of total budgeted
public expenditures and to about 0.5 percent of GDP. This step was
taken in part to intensify efforts to reduce the public sector deficit
and in part to offset the loss of public revenues resulting from a $1.25
per barrel reduction in the export price of light crude oil announced at
the beginning of February. Over a full year, the oil export price
reduction is estimated to reduce export earnings by about $300 million.
At the same time as they reduced the oil price, the authorities raised
the self-imposed ceiling on oil exports from 1.4 million barrels per day
back to 1.5 mbd. The size of the 1985 public sector deficit has been an
issue in Mexico's discussions with the IMF on the terms of the program
for 1985, the last year of the IMF Extended Fund Facility agreement.
However, it is expected that the matter will be resolved shortly and
that a program will be presented to the IMF Executive Board in April for
consideration in May. Drafting of the multi-year debt restructuring
agreement reached last September took longer than originally antici-

IV-30
pated, but the documentation was sent to the participating banks on
March 2 and final signing is expected to begin on March 29. The Mexican
monthly rate of inflation bulged to 7.4 percent in January, but eased to
4.2 percent in February. Real GDP growth in 1984 was 3.5 percent, well
above the 2-3 percent range mentioned most recently as likely to have
been reached.
Brazil must negotiate an amended IMF program for 1985 since mone-
tary and fiscal developments in late 1984 and early 1985 have made the
targets of the agreement reached in November 1984 unrealistic. Prelimi-
nary agreement on the terms of a multi-year rescheduling covering about
$45 billion in public and private sector debt due between 1985 and 1991
has been reached. The terms include a maturity of 16 years, a grace
period effectively averaging six years, and a reduction in the average
spread from an average close to 2 percentage points to 1-1/8 for
Brazilian public sector debt and 1-1/4 for private sector debt.
However, the commercial banks will not complete the agreement on the
rescheduling until the IMF indicates its endorsement of the Brazilian
program and the new government of Tancredo Neves signals its approval. A
telex has gone out to the banks putting in place interim arrangements
and asking the banks to maintain their trade and interbank lines after
the February 19 expiration of existing commitments. So far this year,
the Brazilian trade surplus has been below that recorded in the same
months of 1984. In January and February the trade surplus averaged
$556 million, $177 million less than the January-February 1984 level.
Inflation moderated somewhat in February to a monthly rate of 10.2
percent; in the 12 months since February 1984 general prices rose 226

IV-31
percent. In January, the comparable figures were 12.6 and 232 percent,
respectively. However, recent monetary growth data seem to indicate
that the moderation of inflation could be short-lived. Between February
1984 and February 1985, the monetary base grew 269 percent, up
considerably from the 220 percent rate registered during the 12-month
period ending January 1985. On March 18, the new government announced
some measures aimed at limiting the growth in public spending and infla-
tion. The measures included a three-month moratorium on spending on new
public projects, a three-month suspension of government credit for
export, finance, and agricultural projects, a 10 percent cut in the
budget approved by the former government, and a two-month freeze on
government borrowing on the domestic money market.
Argentina has exceeded some of the quantitative performance limits
specified in its IMF stand-by agreement for the end of 1984 and would
require a waiver to be able to make the first-quarter drawing under the
stand-by. If Argentina and the IMF are unable to agree quickly on the
steps necessary to put the program back on track, the bank package of
new money and debt rescheduling arranged with Argentina's bank advisory
committee at the end of November may well be at risk. The deviations
from the program are in the fiscal area and in the "operating losses" of
the central bank. Not only has public spending been excessive, in large
part as a consequence of the compensatory wage increases granted during
the fourth quarter, but in addition public sector revenues have been
weak and the adjustment of public sector prices has lagged inflation.
Monetary policy was eased in late December and the first two months of
1985, with the result that the free market premium for the dollar rose

IV-32
sharply while unregulated domestic interest rates declined almost to the
level of the regulated rates. However, following the replacement of the
top leadership of the economic team on February 18, there has been some
reversal in monetary policy: regulated interest rates have been raised
by 2 percentage points per month, and the degree of monetary ease has
been reduced somewhat, with the result that the unregulated interest
rates have risen by 5 percentage points per month (to 26.6 percent on
March 13) and the free market premium on the dollar has declined from
about 40 percent to about 34 percent between late February and March 13.
The CPI rose by 25 percent in January and by 20.7 percent in February,
when it was 804 percent higher than in February 1984. The official peso
price of the dollar kept pace with prices in this period. Beginning in
March, monthly wage increases are to be set at 90 percent of the pre-
vious month's inflation rate, with quarterly catch-up raises payable
early in the next quarter.
In the Philippines, the proposed signing on February 26 of loan
agreements with the creditor commercial banks for $925 million in new
credits and a rescheduling of about $4.8 billion in debts had to be
postponed. This was attributable mainly to the reluctance of one bank
to participate in the new credit and rescheduling. On March 4 an IMF
mission began its scheduled review of the Philippine economic situation.
The IMF team is reportedly concerned that the peso has shown too much
strength recently and that the country's export performance has been
poor. During the fourth quarter of last year, exports were up only 2
percent over the same period a year earlier. By the end of this month,
the Philippine authorities will be required to meet an important

IV-33
performance criterion for reserve money (a type of monetary base con-
cept). At the end of February, reserve money was 8 percent above the
end-March ceiling. Last December, the Philippines exceeded the reserve
money ceiling and as a consequence became ineligible to make its second
drawing under the IMF program during March.
Venezuela and its bank advisory committee are nearing completion on
the terms sheet for the multi-year rescheduling agreement negotiated
last September. Previous disagreements about provisions for currency
switching of dollar denominated debt and the obligation of the public
sector to provide foreign exchange to private sector debtors have been
essentially resolved. The terms sheet should be completed by early
April, with circulation to Venezuela's 450 creditor banks beginning in
late April or early May. Before the final signing of the rescheduling
agreement, however, Venezuela must show further progress in the
registration of some $10 billion in private sector debt. Roughly $7.5
billion of this private sector debt has been registered so far. Vene-
zuelan officials claim that the entire private sector debt to financial
institutions will be registered by the end of this month.
In Peru, the government has continued to implement an adjustment
program, including an acceleration of daily devaluations, increases in
gasoline prices and sales taxes, and a halt or a slowing of public
investment projects. In support of the program, the U.S. government
recently released $30 million in disaster aid from 1983 that had been
suspended when Peru fell out of compliance with its IMF program. The
IMF may suggest a set of interim targets prior to negotiation of a
program with the new government to be elected later in the year.

IV-34
Interest arrears to commercial banks now approach $350 million. How-
ever, Peru made a payment of $22 million in mid-February, and the
government has announced its intention to make similar payments each
month for the remainder of the present administration's term, which ends
July 28, 1985. In return, the bank advisory committee has agreed to
recommend that trade credit lines be maintained at their present level
of between $300 and $350 million. Maturing medium- and long-term debt
is being rolled over on a continuing basis for 30-day periods.
The Chilean government recently reached a tentative agreement with
the IMF on a three-year, SDR 750 million, Extended Fund Facility
arrangement. Under the program, the public sector deficit for 1985 is
targeted at 3.5 percent of GDP (versus about 4.5 percent estimated for
1984). The current account deficit is also forecast to drop from $2
billion in 1984 to under $1.4 billion in 1985. The government is
confident that it can come close to meeting these ambitious targets
despite the damage caused by the major earthquake that struck Santiago
and surrounding cities on March 3. The earthquake caused major damage
to roads, housing, and other infrastructure. Chilean exports are likely
to decline temporarily since port facilities and copper mines and
refineries suffered significant damage. The IMF has agreed to allow the
government deficit in 1985 to be "front-loaded" in order to speed the
recovery from the earthquake.
