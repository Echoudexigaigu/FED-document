The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity slowed substantially in recent months from last
year's pace. Although domestic spending has been well maintained, much of
the rise in demand has been met by increased imports rather than through
an expansion of domestic production. Consumer spending, on balance,
remained firm through April, and housing activity has shown greater
strength recently. However, growth in business fixed investment decelerated
sharply in the first quarter, as sluggish spending on new equipment
offset some of the continued strength in nonresidential construction.
Price inflation has picked up slightly in recent months, in part reflecting
temporary pressures in petroleum markets, while wage adjustments have
remained moderate on balance.
Employment and Unemployment
Nonfarm payroll employment increased about 215,000 in April, less
than the average monthly gain of 285,000 for the previous two quarters.
Although the service-producing sector registered less employment growth
in April than earlier this year, substantial gains were reported in
business and health services, wholesale trade, and finance. Construction
hiring was brisk in March and April, reflecting the recent pickup in
residential construction and the persistent strength in commercial building.
Manufacturing employment, however, fell 45,000 in April, bringing the
cumulative job loss since January to 130,000. Most of the recent job
declines have occurred in the durable goods industries, with notable
cutbacks in electrical equipment and machinery.

II-3
The civilian unemployment rate held steady at 7.3 percent in April,
essentially unchanged since last fall. During the same period, there has
been little movement in the unemployment rates for individual categories
of civilian workers.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
The index of industrial production declined 0.2 percent in April
and, on balance, has been flat since last summer. With the exception of
defense and space equipment, most major market sectors shared in the April
decline. Auto assemblies were reduced a bit in April to 8.1 million
units at an annual rate, and the output of other consumer goods also
edged down. Production of business equipment dropped for the fourth
consecutive month. Reflecting these widespread declines in output, the
capacity utilization rate in total industry dropped 1/2 percentage point
in April to about 80-1/2 percent, the lowest level since January 1984.
Personal Income and Consumption
Real personal income continued to rise in the first quarter,
although less rapidly than in the second half of last year. Growth in
private wages and salaries accounted for most of the first-quarter advance,
mainly reflecting higher payrolls in the service-producing sector.
However, personal taxes climbed sharply in the first quarter, largely
because of delays in processing federal tax refunds. As a result, real
disposable income is estimated to have fallen 2 percent at an annual
rate. If the processing of refunds had not been.delayed, real disposable
income would have risen about 2 percent, at an annual rate, compared with
an almost 4 percent pace in the second half of last year.

Consumer spending, which had sagged in March, rebounded in April.
Sales of domestic cars since the beginning of April have been running at
an 8-1/2 million unit annual rate, similar to the strong pace posted in
the first quarter. Analysts attribute part of the recent strength to
below-market financing provided by the major manufacturers for their
smaller cars. Sales of imported cars since February have averaged 2.3
million units, owing to limited supplies of Japanese models.
Excluding outlays for autos, gasoline, and nonconsumer items, nominal
retail sales advanced 0.7 percent in April to a level 1/2 percent above
the first-quarter average. The rise in sales was widespread, with notable
increases in purchases of general merchandise and food. In contrast,
spending on furniture and appliances declined in April.
Business Fixed Investment
Growth in business fixed investment slowed markedly in the first
quarter. While nonresidential construction showed continued strength,
real expenditures on producers' durable equipment declined slightly.
Moreover, a larger share of the equipment purchased last quarter came
from abroad. First-quarter imports of capital goods increased 12 percent
in nominal terms, while shipments of nondefense capital goods by domestic
producers posted a broadly based decline of 3.2 percent.
The value of nonresidential construction put in place fell 1.4
percent in March, the first monthly drop since July 1984. Nonetheless,
for the first quarter as a whole, these expenditures rose 3.7 percent,
similar to the average quarterly gain recorded in 1984. The growth in
spending over the past year, however, has been confined to office and

other commercial construction; while on balance, the other components
of nonresidential construction have been flat. In addition, oil and gas
drilling has weakened considerably in recent months.
Indicators of future business investment have been mixed. Following
two quarters of decline, new orders for nondefense capital goods received
by domestic producers rose a modest 1.8 percent in the first quarter.
New orders last quarter would have fallen if not for a 25 percent
gain in bookings for office and computing equipment. In the construction
area, vacancy rates for office buildings are at record highs, and the
value of nonresidential building contracts and permits may be levelling
off after substantial increases earlier in the recovery. However, according
to capital spending surveys conducted in the past few months, firms still
plan to increase nominal plant and equipment outlays 8-1/2 to 11 percent
in 1985, consistent with sizable gains in investment spending in the
quarters ahead.
Business Inventories
Business inventory accumulation remained moderate in the early part of
1985. After rising at an average annual rate of $33 billion in January
and February, the book value of manufacturing and trade inventories fell
in March; manufacturers continued modest buildups while retail and
wholesale establishments worked to pare their excess stocks. With little
net change in shipments and sales in early 1985, the inventory-sales
ratio for all manufacturing and trade remained stable throughout the
first quarter.

II-10
Manufacturers continued to exhibit cautious inventory behavior
in the first quarter. The book value of factory stocks rose at an annual
rate of $4.7 billion, the same rate as in the fourth quarter. By stage
of processing, the first-quarter rise was entirely in stocks of finished
and in-process goods.
Inventories at auto dealers rose substantially in the first four
months of this year, as car manufacturers stepped up production to alleviate
tight supplies for some models. Despite the increase in assemblies, the
level of dealers' stocks so far this year has hovered around 54 days of
supply, close to the average level during the past year.
Retail trade inventories other than autos fell $11 billion (annual
rate) in March and were little changed for the quarter as a whole. This
improved the inventory positions of retailers to some extent, especially
for general merchandise and apparel stores. Nonetheless, the inventory-sales
ratios for these stores in March were still above historical norms,
suggesting the possibility of further adjustments.
Housing
Indicators of residential construction activity firmed in the first
quarter. Total private housing starts rose 16 percent in March to a 1.9
million unit annual rate. For the first quarter as a whole, housing
starts were up 12 percent, following three successive quarters of decline.
Newly issued residential building permits also registered a solid gain in
the first quarter. The general decline in mortgage credit costs since
last summer is the key factor in the recent strengthening of residential
construction.

Single-family starts, which are relatively sensitive to shifts in
credit costs, have risen nearly 20 percent above last summer's low point
to an annual rate of 1.15 million units in March. The upswing in single-family
starts has paralleled an increase in sales volume for both new and existing
homes. In fact, sales of existing homes in March reached their highest
monthly pace in four and one-half years.
Construction of multifamily units was particularly strong in March.
However, starts of such units recently have been quite volatile, falling
18 percent in the fourth quarter of 1984 before rising 23 percent in the
first quarter of this year. The recent strength in the multifamily
sector has come mainly from construction of rental units located in
southern and western states, which have the country's highest rates of
rental vacancies. Investors seem to be building rental units in these
regions based on long-run economic and tax considerations.
State and Local Sector
Real outlays by state and local governments appear to have picked
up in the first quarter, following a slight decline at the end of last
year. Construction activity, which had been notably weak in late 1984,
rebounded sharply in March. Moreover, the need for further growth in
capital spending remains as capital stock of the state and local
sector has been shrinking for the past five years. However, new plans,
contract awards, and bond sales do point to rising outlays for restoration
and modernization.

II-14
Federal Government
The NIA federal deficit declined in the first quarter to $161
billion at an annual rate from the $198 billion deficit recorded in the
fourth quarter of 1984. Much of the drop can be traced to delays in
the disbursement of tax refunds and to irregular patterns in defense
procurement. In addition, recent declines in interest rates contributed
to slower growth of interest outlays, and individual estimated and final
tax payments1 were substantially above year-earlier levels.
The IRS began processing tax refunds at a much faster rate in
April, and the shortfall of refund payments relative to 1984 was eliminated
in early May. Nonetheless, net tax receipts remain high relative to 1984
because estimated and final tax payments accelerated more sharply than
usual in April and early May. These tax payments have increased this
year in part because of provisions in the Tax Reform Act of 1984 that
limit income averaging and restrict various tax-sheltering activities.
On the spending side, defense outlays slowed markedly in the first
quarter from the strong growth registered in the fourth quarter of last
year, reflecting the irregular delivery patterns for large procurement
items such as the B-1 bomber. Real defense purchases declined in the
first quarter, but they remained almost 6 percent above year-earlier levels.
The administration released revised budget estimates in its April
Budget Update on April 15. The FY1985 deficit projection was reduced
1. Individuals are generally required to make estimated tax payments if
the current year's tax liability appears likely to exceed tax withholding.
Final payments are filed with the tax return and represent the previous
year's tax liability minus withholdings and estimated payments.

through minor revisions to economic assumptions that incorporate recent
data and through technical reestimates of various tax and nondefense
outlay programs. The deficit projections for FY1986 through FY1988 were
cut slightly ($2.6 billion in FY1986), and those for FY1989 and FY1990
were increased slightly.
In action on the FY1986 budget, the Senate approved on May 10 a
budget resolution that would cut the baseline deficit1 $56 billion in
FY1986, $100 billion in FY1987, and $139 billion in FY1988. The resolution
would freeze real defense appropriations in FY1986 and limit real growth
to 3 percent per year in FY1987 and FY1988; would freeze for one year the
COLAs on Social Security, veterans, military and civilian federal
retirement; and would cut numerous nondefense discretionary programs such
as trade adjustment assistance, general revenue sharing, the Economic
Development Administration and direct loans of the Export-Import Bank.
The House Budget Committee is currently marking up its version of a budget
resolution.
Exports and Imports
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in March was close to the sizable
rates recorded in January and February. The deficit for the first quarter
as a whole--$113 billion at an annual rate-slightly exceeded the record
1984 deficit.
1. Baseline projections are designed to show what the deficit would be
in future years if current policies were continued without change. For
defense, the Senate used the Administration's February budget proposal
as its baseline. The baseline for other spending programs and taxes
consists of Congressional Budget Office technical estimates evaluated
with the Administration's economic assumptions.

II-17
Increased imports largely accounted for the widening trade deficit
in the first quarter. There was a broadly based rise in non-oil imports--
especially imports of consumer goods, capital goods, and automotive
products. The high volume of these imports in the first quarter, as well
as the decline in their prices, reflected the past appreciation of the
dollar. Oil imports, however, fell substantially during the first quarter;
domestic oil consumption edged down and inventories were reduced, at
least partly in anticipation of price declines in world markets. The
volume of exports in the first quarter fell somewhat from the fourth-quarter
level, owing primarily to a drop in exports of agricultural commodities.
(Further discussion of international economic developments is included in
section IV.)
Prices
The pace of inflation has increased slightly in recent months, but
much of the acceleration appears to be temporary. The consumer price
index rose 0.5 percent in March, bringing the first-quarter increase to
4.1 percent at an annual rate, 1 percentage point more than in the fourth
quarter. This pickup in the CPI resulted from a sharp swing in used car
prices, as well as price increases for new cars, cigarettes, and apparel.
However, motor vehicle prices at the producer level declined in April
reversing the increases posted last quarter.
Consumer energy prices, which had fallen sharply in January and
February, increased nearly 2 percent in March. This surge in energy
prices reflected what should be a temporary spurt in gasoline prices
stemming from reduced inventories. Supplies of crude oil remain abundant

worldwide, and spot prices for gasoline have been falling in recent
weeks.
Softer food prices have restrained overall price inflation this
year. The food component in the March CPI was unchanged, while the PPI
for consumer foods declined in March and April. At the farm level, food
prices fell during the first four months of this year.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage data for the first quarter of 1985 give a mixed picture of
recent developments. Preliminary data on hourly compensation in the
nonfarm business sector, which includes employers' contributions for
employee benefits and social insurance programs as well as wages, rose
6 percent at an annual rate-about 2 percentage points more than the
increases during 1983 and 1984. Less than half of this recent step-up
resulted from legislated changes in social security taxes effective
January 1 and higher employers' contributions for unemployment insurance.
In contrast, other aggregate wage measures show little if any acceleration.
The comprehensive employment cost index (ECI) for wages paid in private
industry increased at a 4-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter,
the same as 1984. Moreover, during the first four months of 1985, the
hourly earnings index for production and nonsupervisory workers has
increased at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, slightly below the rate
posted in 1984.
Despite some divergence in the aggregate measures of wage inflation,
certain underlying developments are evident. Throughout the private
service-producing sector, wage inflation has continued to decelerate,

while in manufacturing and construction it has picked up recently from
the low rates recorded in 1983 and 1984. All of the recent acceleration
in manufacturing wages has occurred among nonunion workers. The union
sector, whether within or outside manufacturing, has not been a source of
upward wage pressure. New settlements reached during the first quarter
call for nearly record-low first-year increases (exclusive of COLAs), and
wage adjustments scheduled under earlier contracts have continued to
shrink on average.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector fell at a 1-1/4 percent
annual rate in the first quarter, reflecting the sharp slowdown in the
preliminary estimate of output growth. Temporary declines in measured
productivity often occur when output growth decelerates because firms may
continue to base employment decisions on longer-run sales and production
expectations. Thus, the data still appear consistent with an underlying
trend for productivity growth of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. Declining
productivity, coupled with rising compensation growth, led to a jump in
unit labor costs last quarter. However, when viewed over the past year,
unit labor costs have risen more moderately-about 3 percent in the
nonfarm business sector.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have fallen substantially in recent weeks, reversing
the rise that occurred prior to the March FOMC meeting. Yield declines
since late March generally have been in the range of 1/2 to slightly more
than a full percentage point, though rates on new home mortgage commitments,
which had backed up less, have posted more modest decreases, and the prime
rate to date has remained unchanged. The federal funds rate, primarily
around 8 to 8-1/4 percent of late, also has declined comparatively moderately,
but some market expectation of a further easing of the System's reserve
supplying posture or a discount rate cut has been fostered by signs of less
buoyant economic activity and slower money growth. In recent days, Senate
approval of a deficit-reduction package also has had a constructive effect
on market sentiment.
The deceleration of monetary expansion has encompassed all of the
aggregates. M1 grew at a little under a 6 percent annual rate in both
March and April, half of the average pace during the first two months of
the year. And the broader aggregates were essentially flat in April after
slowing markedly in March. The moderation in M1 growth appears generally
consistent with developments in income and interest rates; however, the
sharpness of the slowdown in M2 and M3 appears to have been further
accentuated by the effects of swings in bank securities trading positions
and government deposits and by less aggressive bidding for deposits by
S&Ls in light of sluggish asset expansion.
S&Ls were among the parties likely suffering losses in connection
with the failure of two more government securities dealers (Bevill, Bresler,
and Schulman, and Parr), and there have been deposit withdrawal incidents
III-1

III-2
reflecting continued public edginess about S&Ls, especially those without
federal insurance. Still, there have been no indications of broad effects
of recent financial institution problems on the cost or availability of
credit. Indeed, credit expansion has slowed only a little from last year's
rapid pace. In the business sector, the unabated liquidation of outstanding
equity shares through mergers, repurchases, and other transactions has kept
corporate borrowing sizable in the face of a moderate underlying financing
gap. Firms have tended to favor the bond markets as a source of funds, in
light of the lower level of long-term rates. Households apparently have
maintained a substantial demand for mortgage credit to finance rising home
purchases, and there have been no signs of a slackening in the tremendous
growth of consumer credit. State and local government bond offerings have
been quite heavy, boosted by an increased volume of refunding issues. And
the federal government has continued to borrow large sums, almost entirely
in the intermediate- and long-term maturity sectors.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Ml growth slowed to a bit below 6 percent at an annual rate in March
and April from an 11-1/2 percent pace earlier in the year, leaving the
aggregate just above the upper parallel band associated with its 1985
growth range. A deceleration in money expansion was to be expected on the
basis of the moderate growth of income and spending and the waning effect
of last fall's interest rate declines. Flows related to the April tax date
can have significant transitory effects on cash balances, but the net
impact of refunds and final payments on the pattern of M1 growth appears
to have been small this year.

M2 growth fell sharply in March to a 4 percent annual rate and then
turned slightly negative in April. The weakening in its "nontransactions"
component was due in good part to a reversal of earlier increases in
overnight repurchase agreements, as an appreciable decline in Treasury
securities in bank trading accounts followed a sharp buildup earlier in
the year. Moreover, classification of some overnight RPs as term RPs over
the Easter weekend temporarily reduced M2 in April.
Growth of MMDAs and money market mutual funds also decelerated, as
spreads between market rates and rates on these accounts were wider on
average than in February. Growth likely was further damped in April by
tax payments from these components, which are not seasonally adjusted.
In contrast, small time deposits expanded in March and April for the first
time this year, perhaps reflecting the steepening of the offering-rate curve.
In April, the sum of savings deposits, MMDAs, and small time deposits
apparently grew noticeably more rapidly at banks than at thrifts. While
such a pattern could be reflective of investors' concern about the safety
of thrift deposits, considerable caution must be exercised in so inter-
preting these data. Among other things, the sample data for S&Ls used to
adjust these deposits for IRA/Keogh accounts are not yet available and could
be important in April; there is a considerable month-to-month volatility in
the inter-institutional growth differential; and there is evidence through
March that S&Ls were bidding less aggressively against banks for deposits.
M3 also slowed in March and April, owing mainly to the deceleration
in its M2 components. Growth in large time deposits was substantial in
both months as a surge at commercial banks more than offset a decline at
thrifts, where reduced credit growth-probably in part related to the new

III-5
capital requirements imposed by the FHLBB--has eased the need to issue
large CDs.
Credit expansion at commercial banks remained strong in March, but
fell to a 6-3/4 percent rate in April. Securities holdings were little
changed in March and then fell in April when there was a sizable runoff of
Treasuries from large bank trading accounts. Real estate and consumer
loans continued to grow rapidly in March and April, while business loan
growth picked up in March before falling off sharply in April. In March,
the increase in business loans at domestic offices partly reflected sub-
stantial rebooking of loans to U.S. residents from the foreign branches of
U.S. banks as the prime-LIBOR spread narrowed further and a few large New
York banks reportedly responded to a clarification of the tax status of
these loans by New York state banking authorities.
Business Finance
Commercial paper issuance by nonfinancial firms has been quite variable
on a month-to-month basis, offsetting in part movements in bank loans. The
sum of bank loans and commercial paper decelerated to 6-3/4 percent in
April from a 9 percent rate in March; on average for the first quarter,
this measure increased at about a 5 percent annual rate. Growth of finance
company credit slowed in March from a considerably stronger pace earlier in
the year, and bankers acceptances resumed their earlier downtrend.1
The slower growth in loans and open market paper thus far this year
is in line with the lower rate of inventory accumulation and the continued

moderate overall gap between capital outlays and internal funds. However,
corporate financing needs have reflected as well the run-off of outstanding
shares in mergers, buyouts, and share repurchases, which has been at roughly
the same pace as in 1984 as a whole. Relatively attractive costs in the
bond markets have led to heavier reliance on these markets in recent months.
Corporate borrowing in tax-exempt bond markets has slackened markedly
since the year-end rush to beat the application of tighter arbitrage rules
and of state-by-state volume limits for industrial development bonds. But
issuance of taxable bonds in both domestic and overseas markets by nonfinan-
cial firms has been high so far this year, averaging only a bit less than
in the record-breaking fourth quarter. Offerings were particularly strong
in March, owing to a $4-1/2 billion exchange of debt for equity by Phillips
Petroleum, and in April, reflecting a downward trend in interest rates.
The A-rated utility bond index has fallen 7/8 of a percentage point since
the last FOMC meeting, narrowing an already low spread against long Treasury
bonds. Bond issuance was light in early May but has picked up most recently
with the continued decline in yields.
Financial issues totaled more than $5 billion in April, a record
even on an inflation-adjusted basis. Finance subsidiaries of automobile
manufacturers have been especially heavy borrowers, issuing more than
$3-1/2 billion of debt during the intermeeting period; much of the proceeds
of these issues has been used to finance new promotional loan programs.
Major stock price averages have remained near their cyclical peaks
since the last FOMC; the NYSE has set a new high. The strong market stimu-
lated an increased volume of new equity issues and equity-based bonds in
April; even so, in recent months the volume of new stock issues for

U.S. Government Securities Markets
The staff is projecting a combined (on- and off-budget) deficit for
the current quarter of about $33 billion. The Treasury is expected to
meet its financing requirements for the quarter by net borrowing of about
$38 billion from the public, allowing for a small rise in cash balances.
The Treasury is raising an even larger-than-usual share of its new money
in auctions of marketable coupon issues. The sale of $20.5 billion of
securities in May was a record for any mid-quarter financing, but the
amount of new funds raised totaled $9.9 billion, less than the all-time
high of $11.2 billion in the February 1984 refunding. The mid-quarter
financing went well by all of the usual criteria and, in general, the
government securities market has continued to function smoothly despite
the recent dealer failures. Nonetheless, some small dealers have found it
a bit harder to obtain financing.
The Treasury is continuing to expand its STRIPs program, with both
the 10- and 30-year securities issued in the mid-quarter financing .eligible.
The Treasury has announced that the STRIPS program will be modified by
assigning "generic CUSIP" numbers to all coupons on securities eligible
for STRIPS that are payable on the same date, regardless of the original
security from which they were stripped. As a result, they will be inter-
changeable in trading and at delivery, increasing their liquidity in the
secondary market.

Borrowing by the sponsored credit agencies was negligible on balance
in April after remaining moderate in the first quarter, when net funds
raised totaled about $3-1/2 billion. Fannie Mae accounted for most of this
borrowing; its mortgage purchases have picked up sharply since the fourth
quarter of last year. In addition to its borrowing, Fannie Mae recently
issued $100 million of common stock, raising its ratio of stockholders'
equity to total assets only slightly to a still low 1.4 percent.
Net issuance of debt was light at the Federal Home Loan Banks and
negative at the Farm Credit Banks in the first quarter. The increase in
advances by thrift institutions was small, on a not seasonally adjusted
basis, and the FHLBs financed them through the deposits of member insti-
tutions and by drawing down liquid assets. Borrowing by the Farm Credit
Banks has been slack for some time, as increased financial strain among
farmers has resulted in a decline in their farm loans outstanding.1 There
is still no evidence that the farm sector problem is affecting the ability
of the Farm Credit Banks to sell securities: their most recent issues came
at yields very close to those on Treasury securities.
Tax-Exempt Securities Markets
Issuance of all tax-exempt bonds has trended up since early this
year; in April, offerings totaled $9.5 billion, and issuance continued near
this pace in early May. In the short-term market, offerings of notes had
been coming to market at the rate of about $700 million a month, but April's
1. In addition, farm loans at commercial banks showed a large decline in the
first quarter, following a small increase over 1984. The recent fall in farm
credit advanced by private lenders has been partly offset by increased lending
at the Farmers Home Administration, particularly under their regular programs
rather than the new debt adjustment program.

volume jumped to $5.2 billion, as New York state, in its annual spring
financing, issued tax and revenue anticipation notes totaling $4.3 billion.
Offerings of long-term tax-exempt securities have been buoyed this
year by a large volume of refunding bonds (see chart), as rates moved
below 10 percent in January and again in April. Underwriters report that
when market yields are as much as 2 to 3 percentage points below rates on
outstanding bonds, the potential cost saving is great enough for state and
local units to issue refunding bonds. Offerings of these bonds rose to
around $2.5 billion in April and a large amount currently is scheduled
again for May.
Municipal bond volume in April also may have been augmented by an
expected legislated constraint. Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984,
bonds that have federal guarantees are ineligible for tax-exemption. A
recent court decision suggests that securities backed by letters of credit
(LOCs) issued by FDIC-insured banks could be construed as having federal
guarantees.1 The IRS originally had announced that municipal bonds backed
by LOCs of federally insured banks could lose their tax-exempt status if
issued after May 1, and some financings were moved ahead to beat that deadline.
However, in late April, the deadline was postponed to January 1, 1986.
As of mid-May, the Bond Buyer 30-year revenue index had fallen nearly
70 basis points since the last FOMC meeting, somewhat more than the decline
in taxable bond yields. At the shorter end of the market, 1-year prime-
grade G.O. bonds, at 5.00 percent, were down 50 basis points from their
March FOMC level.
1. In December 1984, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in
Denver ruled that the FDIC had to back up a letter of credit issued by Penn
Square Bank, which failed in July 1982.

Mortgage Markets
Costs of home mortgage finance have declined since the last FOMC
meeting, nearing the lows of mid-February. Commitments for fixed-rate
mortgage loans at selected S&Ls were available at an average contract rate
of 13.02 percent for the week ending May 10, 27 basis points below the
recent peak in late March. Rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages
offered by some of these same S&Ls dropped a bit more, and the initial rate
advantage on these ARMs widened to 240 basis points, probably reflecting
the steepening of the yield curve. Adjustable-rate mortgages accounted
for 49 percent of all conventional loans closed in early April--a share
that has changed little since last December and is considerably below what
was observed in early 1984.
In the market for federally underwritten mortgages, which have
accounted for approximately 15 percent of all home loans originated recently,
price discounts on GNMA-guaranteed securities issued against pools of FHA
and VA mortgages shrank to less than one point in mid-April. In response,
on April 19, the Veterans Administration lowered the ceiling rate on its
regular VA-guaranteed loans to 12.50 percent, reversing the 50 basis point
increase authorized just three weeks earlier.
With continued strong credit demand, total residential mortgage
debt growth has remained vigorous in the first quarter, accommodated primarily
by strong increases in FNMA portfolio holdings and by heavy issuance of
federally-guaranteed mortgage pass-through securities. However, preliminary
April data indicate that new issues of these securities dropped off.
Mortgage activity at FSLIC-insured thrift institutions generally has been
weak so far this year. First-quarter growth in holdings of mortgage-related

assets by thrift institutions was the slowest since mid-1982, despite a
pickup in March, and new commitments to originate or purchase mortgages
were off in March, though much less than in the previous two months. As
noted earlier, lending by some S&Ls likely is being constrained by the FHLBB
net worth regulations that have been in effect since the beginning of the
year.
Recently inaugurated purchase programs at FNMA and FHLMC have spurred
use of two less common mortgage forms. Mortgages with 15-year maturities
accounted for 20 percent of all conventional fixed-rate home loans closed
in early March; both agencies have been buying substantial volumes in
response to attractive yields and strong investor demand. Another type,
known as convertible ARMs, offers the borrower the option of later
switching to a fixed-rate payment schedule without incurring many of the
usual refinancing fees; this instrument has accounted for approximately
half of FNMA's growing (though still limited) ARM purchases in recent months.
Consumer Installment Credit
Partial data suggest that consumer installment credit continued to
expand rapidly during April, perhaps matching the 22 percent gain in the
first quarter. Growth of consumer credit has been unusually robust during
the current expansion; the cumulative growth of total consumer installment
credit has increasingly outstripped the average for the five previous
business cycle recovery periods. The strength in the current expansion in
part reflects vigorous growth in expenditures for autos and other consumer
durable goods. Recently, some households may have used consumer credit to
finance household expenditures pending the arrival of refund checks.

The growth of consumer installment credit has been strong at
depository institutions, especially reflecting the attractive margins on
various types of consumer loans and unusually favorable delinquency rates.1
On balance, bankers sampled in the Survey of Senior Loan Officer Opinion
in February reported a further increase in willingness to extend consumer
credit. Banks have been regaining market share that other lenders, par-
ticularly captive finance companies, absorbed between 1979 and 1983.
However, during February captive finance companies reduced new-auto loan
rates 1-1/4 percentage points, shrinking the rate advantage typically
enjoyed by banks. Special interest rate incentives at these finance
companies have been extended through May.
Other depository institutions have sought to increase their partici-
pation in the consumer credit market. Thrift institutions have continued
to respond to the broader lending powers provided by the Depository
Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act. In addition, federal
credit union lending activity has been boosted by regulatory changes that
broadened requirements for membership eligibility.
1. Despite an increase in delinquency rates at captive auto finance
companies since mid-1984, these rates remain in a historically low range.

APPENDIX A*
BANKERS ACCEPTANCES IN THE MEASURE OF SHORT-
AND INTERMEDIATE-TERM BUSINESS CREDIT
In recent years the analytic focus of the measure of short- and
intermediate-term business credit, shown in the table on p. III-6, has been
shifting. Formerly, this measure focused on funds raised in U.S. markets
for business purposes, regardless of whether the proceeds were used to
finance business activity in the United States or abroad. More recently,
the measure has focused increasingly on the total volume of funds raised
to finance business activity in the United States, regardless of whether
the funds were raised in U.S. markets or abroad. Specifically, in the
bank loan component of this grouping of business credit, business loans
to U.S. residents that are booked at foreign branches of U.S. banks now
are included and business loans to foreign residents that are booked at
international banking facilities are excluded.
In light of this change in focus, the treatment of bankers accep-
tances has been revised. Previously, this business credit measure
included total outstanding U.S. dollar-denominated bankers acceptances
that were payable in the United States, regardless of the nature of the
transaction financed by the acceptance. The revised series includes
only those acceptances that are related to U.S. trade-that is, those
acceptances that finance U.S. imports, U.S. exports, domestic shipment
or domestic storage of goods. Excluded are those acceptances that are
related to foreign trade--that is, those acceptances that finance ship-
ment of goods between foreign countries or storage of goods in foreign
countries.
As shown on the table below, U.S. trade related acceptances grew
6 percent last year, compared with a 1-1/2 percent contraction of total
acceptances. Total short- and intermediate-term credit is now estimated
to have expanded at an 18 percent annual rate in 1984, up from 16-1/2
percent before the revision. The effect of this revision of the accep-
tance component is significant for two reasons: first, as indicated on
the table, the volume of U.S. trade related acceptances is only about
half of all acceptances; and second, total bankers acceptances have not
grown on balance since the end of 1982, with particularly pronounced
weakness in 1984 in the components related to foreign trade.
The weakness in total bankers acceptances over the past two years
has developed despite a significant liberalization of regulations govern-
ing the creation of reserve-free acceptances in October 1982. Prior to
October 1982, the creation of reserve-free acceptances by member banks was
subject to an aggregate limitation of 50 percent of capital and surplus
(100 percent with prior Board approval). With the rapid growth of the
acceptance market during the 1970s, some major banks reached this limit.
Although an increasing share of demands for acceptance financing was met

by regional banks and by nonmember banks and U.S. agencies and branches
of foreign banks, which were not subject to aggregate acceptance limits,
the aggregate supply of acceptance financing apparently was significantly
constrained by the regulatory ceilings, and spreads on acceptance financ-
ing (acceptance commissions) reportedly averaged more than 100 basis
points. The Bank Export Services Act of 1982 raised the aggregate ceiling
on the creation of reserve-free acceptances to 150 percent of capital and
surplus (200 percent with Board approval) and applied the new ceiling uni-
formly to member banks, nonmember banks, and U.S. agencies and branches of
foreign banks. This action effectively removed the constraint on the
aggregate supply of acceptance financing since few, if any, institutions
have approached the new ceilings.

III-A-3
Immediately following the removal of the supply constraint,
acceptances grew at a 13 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of
1982. At the same time, acceptance commissions reportedly narrowed. The
lack of growth in outstanding acceptances since the end of 1982, combined
with reportedly thin acceptance commissions, suggest that demand has
stagnated. This conclusion is supported by other evidence, including the
views expressed by corporate lending officers in the April 23, 1985 Senior
Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (LPS). In addition,
banks seem to have become more reluctant to finance this activity at narrow
margins.
The demand for acceptance financing is related to the volume of
eligible trade transactions and the availability and relative cost of
alternative sources of funds. The volume of eligible trade transactions
most likely has grown sluggishly, if at all, over the past several years.
Worldwide international trade actually contracted in the early 1980s as a
result of global recession and the financing difficulties encountered by
many developing countries. Moreover, the value of shipments of oil and
other commodities, which frequently are financed with acceptances, fell
particularly sharply as prices of many of these goods declined. Almost 40
percent of the 60 large banks responding to the April LPS indicated that a
reduction in the volume of eligible transactions has contributed to the
sharp declines on balance in the volume of acceptance financing since
mid-1984.
More importantly, the demand for acceptance financing also has been
reduced in recent years by substitution of alternative, less costly forms
of financing. Eighty percent of the respondents to the April LPS identi-
fied the increased availability of alternative sources of funds as another
factor depressing the use of acceptance financing. A large proportion of
the acceptances created by domestic banks are essentially interbank loans.
Many foreign banks, primarily Japanese and other Asian banks and to a
degree Scandinavian banks, have relied on U.S.-chartered banks to refinance
their own acceptances.1 But in recent years Japanese banks apparently have
met an increasing share of their financing requirements by substituting
Eurodollar CDs and interbank borrowings for acceptance financing. Although
1. After accepting a draft from their own customers, these banks often
draw a draft on a U.S. bank for acceptance, thereby creating an acceptance
in the U.S. market. The U.S. banks then typically resell these acceptances
in the secondary markets and charge the foreign banks a commission, or
spread, over and above the rates the U.S. banks pay on their acceptances.
Results of the April LPS suggest that roughly 60 percent of the acceptances
outstanding at the end of March 1985 were loans to foreign banks for the
purpose of refinancing their customers' eligible trade transactions.
Acceptance credit extended to U.S. corporate customers accounted for only
17 percent of aggregate acceptance volume at these banks, while foreign
customers other than banks accounted for most of the remainder.

III-A-4
the total of acceptances is not affected, Japanese banks also have issued
more of their own acceptances directly in the U.S. market rather than
refinancing through U.S. banks.1
The availability of funding for Japanese banks in the U.S. accep-
tance market and the Eurodollar CD market in London has increased
dramatically in recent years as investors in these markets, primarily U.S.
residents, apparently have favorably reassessed the risks associated with
claims on Japanese banks. For top rated Japanese banks, the costs of
directly issuing acceptances or Eurodollar CDs are generally less than the
all-in cost of refinancing acceptances through U.S. banks (the all-in cost
is the sum of the acceptance commission and the rate on the U.S. bank's own
acceptance). Top tier Japanese acceptances and CDs reportedly now trade
at less than 10 basis points above the rates on acceptances issued by prime
U.S. banks. Respondents to the April LPS indicated that acceptance com-
missions on refinancings for prime foreign banks have averaged about 38
basis points recently, implying an all-in cost about 30 basis points higher
than the cost to Japanese banks of issuing their own acceptances or Eurodollar
CDs to finance eligible transactions. Eurodollar interbank borrowings also
have become more attractive relative to refinancings through the acceptance
market. Since October 1982 the spread between LIBOR and acceptance rates
has fallen from more than 100 basis points to about 30 basis points.
The demand for acceptance financing by U.S. corporations also likely
has been restrained in recent years by the spread of attractive financing
alternatives. More firms have gained access to the commercial paper market
and the volume of outstanding paper has grown considerably. In addition,
banks have offered an increasing number of corporations an expanded menu of
below-prime pricing options. Loan commitments now frequently offer pricing
tied to LIBOR or the effective cost of domestic CDs. To date, however, a
bankers acceptance pricing option generally has not been available under
loan commitments; 77 percent of the respondents to the April LPS indicated
that such an option is offered seldom or is never offered. Consequently,
the use of acceptance financing creates an opportunity cost if a corpora-
tion pays a fee on the unused portion of a loan commitment.
The growth of the acceptance market also may have been restrained
over the last year by a decrease in the willingness of banks to offer
acceptance financing. With the decline in acceptance commissions since
the liberalization of capital limits, acceptance financing is now regarded
as a relatively low-margin business. Under pressure from financial markets
and regulatory authorities to reduce leverage, some banks have attempted
to reduce the growth of low-margin assets, including acceptance financing.
About 37 percent of the respondents to the April LPS reported that attempts
to increase commissions or to avoid low-margin activities have led to a
decrease in the supply of acceptances in recent months.
1. Since October 1982, Eurodollar CDs outstanding at London branches of
Japanese banks increased from $17 to $30 billion. Over the same period,
acceptance liabilities of U.S. agencies and branches of Japanese banks
have doubled to more than $17 billion.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
On balance since the last FOMC meeting, the weighted-average
foreign exchange value of the dollar, displayed in the top panel of the
chart, has depreciated 4-1/2 percent. Shifting perceptions about the
strength of economic activity in the United States, about the stability
of certain U.S. financial institutions, and about the associated
responses of monetary policy and interest rates to these factors appeared
to be the primary influences on exchange rate movements over the period.
Over the first four weeks following the last FOMC meeting, the
dollar experienced a net depreciation of 7-1/4 percent, bringing the
total decline from its late February peak to about 12 percent. The
unexpectedly low "flash" estimate of U.S. GNP growth in the first quarter
released just before the last meeting, sparked a steep decline in the
dollar's value in the first week of the intermeeting period. The dollar
rebounded 2-1/2 percent early in April in response to stronger than
expected March data for U.S. employment and leading indicators; but
downward pressure re-emerged after release of further indications of
slowing economic activity and of difficulties at some U.S. financial
institutions. In mid-April, the weighted-average value of the dollar
reached its lowest level in 5 months following news that first quarter
GNP was estimated to have indeed grown only at a 1.3 annual percent rate.
By that time, short-term dollar interest rates had fallen about 60 basis
points since the last FOMC, while a weighted-average of comparable
foreign rates had also eased, but somewhat less. This widening of the
IV-1

IV-2
interest differential in favor of assets denominated in foreign
currencies during the first half of the intermeeting period can be seen
in the bottom panel of the chart.
In the ensuing two-week period, the dollar appreciated about 3-1/2
percent, apparently in response largely to predictions by U.S. public
officials that U.S. economic growth would pick up over the remainder of
1985. As can also be seen in the bottom panel of the chart, short-term
dollar interest rates rose slightly more rapidly than foreign rates
during that time. In the final week of the intermeeting period, a series
of statements by U.S. public officials about the near-term prospects for
U.S. economic growth heightened market uncertainty about the future
course of dollar interest rates. The dollar declined while market
commentary indicated an increasing expectation that the Federal Reserve
would move toward an easing of monetary conditions. Currently, the
weighted-average value of the dollar stands 10 percent below its peak in
late February.
Sterling has fluctuated over an unusually wide range since the last
FOMC meeting, and has appreciated a particularly sharp 7-1/2 percent
against the dollar and 4 percent on a weighted-average basis.
Indications that growth in sterling M3 continued to exceed its target
range appeared to increase expectations that any reduction in sterling
interest rates would be delayed, providing support for the pound. On
balance over the inter-meeting period, declines in short-term sterling
interest rates have kept pace with the fall in comparable dollar rates,
but the reductions in sterling interest rates were nonetheless smaller

IV-3
than earlier anticipated. Several reductions in U.K. base lending and
money market dealing rates were announced, and the key sterling 3-month
interbank rate had fallen nearly 1 percentage point to approximately
12-1/2 percent by the end of the intermeeting period.

External lending by BIS-reporting banks in 1984. Cross-border
claims of all BIS-reporting banks increased by $126 billion in 1984,
after adjustment to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the
dollar value of the stock of non-dollar claims. This increase,
amounting to about six percent, was somewhat greater than in 1983, and
followed two years of sharp reductions in total net new bank lending.
However, new lending to the non-OPEC developing countries declined for
the third successive year, and that to the OPEC countries was almost
nil.
In 1984, the only group of countries to which the reporting banks
significantly stepped up their lending was that group combining the
reporting area countries (most of the industrial countries) and offshore
banking centers. These two components were almost fully merged in
December 1983 when all banks in most offshore centers became part of the
reporting area. (See footnote 3 on table.) The acceleration in lending
to these countries was entirely the result of a higher rate of interbank
lending between non-U.S. banks. Net new lending to Eastern Europe
shifted from negative to positive but the swing was only $3 billion.
Net new lending to OPEC countries fell from $10 billion in 1983 to $1
billion last year as claims on these countries either rose more slowly
or in some cases (Arabian Gulf States, Nigeria, Venezuela) declined
absolutely.
The further drop from $12 billion in 1983 to $9 billion in 1984 in
lending to the non-OPEC developing countries was concentrated in Latin
America, but lending to the Asian and African countries remained

Latin America mainly reflected smaller non-spontaneous lending to
Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Peru, partly offset by greater such lending
to Brazil. In addition, bank claims on Brazil were reduced by sales of
some claims to nonbank foreign investors, mostly multinational
corporations.

IV-7
U.S. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
Data now available on banking, securities and official capital
transactions in the first quarter of 1985 account for about sixty
percent of the financial counterpart to the large estimated current
account deficit over the same period. Sizeable net capital inflows
were recorded by banks and through private foreign net purchases of
U.S. corporate bonds. Private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury
obligations accounted for a moderate inflow, though greatly diminished
from that recorded in the fourth quarter of 1984. These inflows were
somewhat offset by a large recorded net outflow of foreign official
reserve assets held in the United States. (See Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table.)
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds were
strong for the second consecutive quarter, totalling more than $10
billion (see line 2a). This figure mainly reflects a large volume of
new issues of U.S. corporate bonds in late 1984 and early 1985.
Since there is a lag between the offering date and the payment date on
bond issues, the monthly pattern of new issues and the pattern of
recorded sales in the balance of payments statistics do not coincide.
The pause in underwriting activity in February and March and the
buildup of underwriters' inventories, which may have reflected
uncertainty over the course of interest rates, will likely be more
fully reflected in the second quarter. Unofficial data suggests that
more vigorous issuance has resumed in April and the first half of
May.

Private net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities totalled less
than $3 billion in the first quarter, which is considerably smaller
than the net purchases recorded in the previous three quarters. A
portion of the diminished foreign demand for Treasury securities may
be related to the fact that Japanese Trust Banks are approaching the
limit on the proportion of pension fund assets which may be invested
in securites denominated in foreign currencies.
In the first quarter foreign official holdings in the United
States declined by nearly $11 billion reflecting substantial net
intervention sales of dollars during the period. Reductions in the
holdings of G-10 countries accounted for nearly one half of the total.
Preliminary information indicates that official holdings at the FRBNY
are essentially unchanged in April.
There was a massive net inflow from abroad and IBFs into
banking offices in the United States in the first quarter. (See the
table on the Changes in Net Foreign Positions of Domestic Banking
Offices in the United States.- Over one half of this inflow
came from banks' own foreign offices and IBFs and reflects the
reversal during the quarter of an outflow of similar magnitude which
occurred on the final day of 1984. In addition, there were sizeable
net inflows from unaffiliated banking offices abroad. The latter
consisted mainly of reductions in the category of claims which
includes bankers acceptances. There is some evidence that banks have

been paring from their balance sheets assets with low profit margins,
such as bankers acceptances, in response to pressures to improve their
capital adequacy.
In addition, there was an increase of almost $3 billion in
liabilities to private nonbanks in the first quarter, mainly from
Latin America. Mexicans alone increased their deposits at banks in
the United States about $750 million and increased their deposits at
IBFs by almost $80 million. These data suggest intensified capital
flight, although perhaps one third could reflect accumulating interest
on existing balances and part could, in theory, reflect a shift in
funds from offshore financial centers.

U.S. Merchandise Trade in 1985-Q1
The merchandise trade deficit in the first quarter of 1985 was larger
than in the fourth quarter of last year but smaller than the record
third-quarter rate. Most of the changes in the trade deficit in recent
quarters have been attributable to swings in imports; the level of exports
has been fairly steady.
The strength of nonoil imports in the first quarter was broadly based.
The largest increases were in consumer goods (particularly clothing,
household appliances and electronic goods), in a wide range of capital goods
(industrial machines, construction machinery, business machines, other
electronic items, machine tools, and aircraft), and in automotive products
(particularly new passenger cars from Europe). There were also increases in
many categories of industrial supplies (including steel) and in foods.

Compared with the level of imports a year ago, the volume of nonoil imports
in the first quarter was up by nearly 15 percent. Much of the increase is in
response to the effects of the past appreciation of the dollar and the
strength of domestic spending through the first quarter of 1985.
Nonetheless, recent quarter-to-quarter changes in the volume of nonoil
imports have been very volatile; in the last five quarters, the rates of
change have been 13 percent, -1 percent, 12 percent, -9 percent, and 14
percent respectively, at quarterly rates. The unit value price index for
nonoil imports changed very little during 1984; in the first quarter of 1985
however, it declined by about 2-1/2 percent, possibly in response to the
dollar's appreciation.
The volume of oil imports dropped 23 percent in the first quarter and
the average price of imported oil declined by about 75 cents per barrel.
Domestic oil consumption declined slightly and inventories were drawn down at
a greater-than-seasonal rate, at least partly in anticipation of further
price declines in world markets. Spot prices for oil products began to move
down in March and continued to decline in April; they had increased in
January and February as a consequence of extremely cold weather in Europe,
continuation of the coal strike in the United Kingdom (which was settled in
March), and a drop in oil production by the USSR and Iran.

Total exports in the first quarter were at about the same level as in
the fourth quarter; agricultural exports fell while nonagricultural exports
increased somewhat.
The decline in agricultural exports in the first quarter is an
indication of the generally weak market for U.S. farm commodities in
countries other than the Soviet Union. Most of the reduction in the first
quarter was in wheat exports which fell to the lowest level in eight years;
U.S. wheat faces intense competition from France, Argentina and Australia as
well as from good crops worldwide. Exports of feedgrains (largely corn)
declined only marginally as large shipments to the USSR offset the smaller
amounts shipped to other countries; traditional U.S. customers such as Japan
and Mexico purchased lower-priced feedgrains from China and Thailand. Since
last July, the USSR has contracted for a record 22 million metric tons (MMT)
of grain from the United States (largely corn); all but 4 MMT of the grain
ordered was exported by the end of March.
The volume of nonagricultural exports in the first quarter was about
the same as the levels recorded in the previous two quarters. There were
increases in machinery (electronic and telecommunications equipment),
aircraft, passenger cars to Canada, and coal, that were offset by declines in
other items, particularly in industrial supplies. While the current volume
of exports is 7 percent above the level of a year ago, most of this increase
occurred between the second and third quarters of last year. The average
price of nonagricultural exports rose somewhat in the first quarter after
being little changed during 1984.

IV-16
Foreign Economic Developments. In the early months of 1985, the
index of industrial production declined in the major foreign industrial
countries except the United Kingdom from average monthly levels reached
in the final quarter of 1984. Nevertheless, production generally
remained above year-earlier levels except in France, where it fell
slightly. Unusually severe weather in Europe may have accounted for
the fall-off in production, and other indicators of economic activity
in Canada and Japan suggest continued growth in the first quarter.
Reflecting the overall sluggishness of activity, however, unemployment
rates increased in the European countries and were either at post-World
War II highs or close to them. The unemployment rate declined slightly
in Canada and Japan.
Though inflation in all countries remains relatively low, it
appears that further declines may not be imminent. Japan and France
continue to show lower inflation, though reductions have been small
recently. Canadian inflation, which declined throughout 1984, leveled
off in recent months as did inflation in Italy. Meanwhile, inflation
in Germany, and the United Kingdom increased slightly in early 1985.
With the exception of Japan and Germany, the external sectors of
the foreign industrial countries weakened in early 1985. Japan's
current account balance was higher in the first quarter (s.a.a.r.) than
in all of 1984, a record year. Germany showed improvement over year-
earlier levels in both current account and trade surpluses. Although
the Canadian trade balance (s.a.a.r.) remained in surplus early this
year, it was lower than 1984's record high. Trade deficits increased
in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

Individual Country Notes. The pace of economic activity in Japan
has apparently slowed. Industrial production declined 2.7 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter after a sharp rise of 11.6 percent in
the final quarter of 1984. Other economic indicators (s.a.) in the
first quarter were positive, however, and suggest the expansion is
continuing: retail sales rose by 3.3 percent; housing starts increased
by 2.6 percent; and new construction orders were up by more than 9
percent, despite a slight decline in March. In addition, the latest
monthly assessments by the Economic Planning Agency and the Bank of
Japan report that private plant and equipment spending continues to
show a healthy expansion.
Inflation remained low in Japan. The wholesale price index in
March was less than 1 percent above its year-earlier level. In the
year ending April, the Tokyo consumer price index rose 2 percent. The
current account surplus in the first quarter was $37-1/2 billion
(s.a.a.r.), compared with a surplus of $35 billion in 1984. The first-
quarter surplus was, however, below that of the final quarter of 1984,
reflecting a slowdown of export growth.
On April 9, Prime Minister Nakasone announced his "New Economic
Initiative," consisting of some specific measures and a generalized
campaign to persuade the Japanese people to buy more imports. He also
stated that he would take "fullest account of" the recommendations of
the Advisory Committee on External Economic Issues (headed by Dr.
Okita). The Committee's report makes general recommendations on the
need to open Japanese markets, and briefly notes the importance of
stimulating domestic demand to reduce external surpluses. In mid-

IV-21
April, Nakasone rejected suggestions from important members of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for a bond-financed increase in
the government deficit. Since then his opposition to increased
spending is reported to have softened in view of increasing sentiment
in the LDP for such a change. However, Finance Minister Takeshita, a
possible successor to Nakasone, favors fiscal restraint.
Economic activity in Germany has weakened so far this year.
Industrial production has barely changed since January, and on average
dropped 1-1/2 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter. The cause for this
weakness was lackluster domestic demand, which was only partially
offset by strong export activity. The construction sector was
particularly weak, as unusually severe winter weather compounded
underlying structural problems. Domestic demand for automobiles also
added to the weakness, as prospective buyers awaited a government
decision about mandatory pollution control equipment. The unemployment
rate was 9.3 percent in the first quarter, higher than last year's
average and close to the record high reached in the summer of 1983.
Consumer price inflation increased to an annual rate of almost
5.0 percent in the first four months of this year, compared with 3
percent in the final quarter last year. The year-on-year rate in April
was 2.5 percent, after having been as low as 1.5 percent late last
year. The acceleration of consumer prices can be traced to import
prices, which in March were almost 9 percent above their year-earlier
level; wholesale and producers prices have also accelerated this year.
Both trade and current account surpluses increased in the first quarter
compared to the first quarter of 1984.

IV-22
The Bundesbank announced that foreign banks in Germany will be
permitted to lead-manage DM denominated bonds as of May 1. Also lifted
were prohibitions against zero coupon bonds, variable rate bonds and
swaps.
The industrial production index in France increased by 4.7
percent (s.a.) in February, completely reversing the sharp decline in
the index over the previous three months. Production figures for
December and January appear to have been distorted owing to unusually
severe winter weather. On.a year-over-year basis, the January-February
average production index was down almost 2 percent. In a further
indication of the weakness of French economic activity, it was
announced that year-over-year real GDP growth in 1984 had been revised
downward to 1.6 percent from the initial figure of 2.0 percent (the
revised quarterly pattern is not yet available). After reaching a
record high level of 10.7 percent (s.a.) in January, the unemployment
rate eased back in March to 10.5 percent to where it was at the end of
1984.
Consumer prices increased by 0.7 percent (n.s.a.) in March,
leaving the year-over-year inflation rate unchanged at 6.4 percent.
The trade deficit was reduced sharply in March to $60 million (s.a.).
For the first quarter as a whole, the trade deficit was $4.4 billion
(s.a.a.r.), compared with a trade deficit of $2.6 billion in 1984.
Preliminary indications are that the government's 1986 budget
will combine continued tax reductions (including a 3 percent income tax
cut) and freezes or reductions in government spending programs
(including a 1 percent reduction in civil service employment), designed

IV-23
to leave the government deficit about unchanged at its current level of
3 percent of GDP.
Real gross domestic product (average measure) in the United
Kingdom grew 6.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter of 1984.
About two-thirds of this growth, however, was accounted for by
inventory investment as stocks rose following three quarters of
decline. For the year as a whole, real GDP grew 2.3 percent (Q4/Q4).
More recently the index of industrial production for the two months
ending in February was only .7 percent above year-earlier levels. This
low growth rate reflects the year-long coalminers' strike which ended
on March 4. In the absence of the coal strike, measured industrial
production would have been about 3 percentage points higher.
The unemployment rate rose slightly to 13.1 percent (s.a.) in
April, a post World War II high, while year-over-year inflation in
retail prices increased to 6.1 percent in March. This increase is
partly due to rising mortgage interest rates. Although the Bank of
England lowered its money market dealing rates by 150 basis points
in three steps between March 20 and April 19, it signaled that it is
not prepared to sanction a rapid fall in short-term rates.
The trade deficit widened substantially in March to $12.2 billion
(s.a.a.r.), from $3.5 billion in February. About one-half of the
increase in the trade deficit represented increased imports of fuel
oil, thought to reflect a restoration of stocks run down towards the
end of the coalminers' strike. The trade deficit for the first quarter
of 1985 was $5.6 billion (s.a.a.r.) while the current account was in
near balance.

Growth in Canada continued at a moderate pace, following the
easing of credit market conditions in the second half of 1984 and into
January. Gross domestic product expanded in January and February,
pushing the two-month average level 0.7 percent above last year's
fourth-quarter pace. Industrial production, which accounts for about
30 percent of total output, declined in January and February leaving
the index 1.1 percent below last December's level. Meanwhile, the
unemployment rate in April fell to 10.9 percent only slightly below the
first quarter's average of 11.1 percent.
Inflation continued to be moderate. Consumer prices were 3.7
percent higher in March than a year earlier. The industry selling
price rose only 2.7 percent for the twelve months ending in March, down
from February's twelve-month inflation rate of 3.1 percent. Meanwhile
Canada's trade surplus increased slightly in March to $1.6 billion, a
record high, up from February's surplus of $1.3 billion. The trade
surplus for the first quarter was $4.0 billion, below the pace of $4.4
billion achieved in the fourth quarter .of 1984.
Economic activity in Italy appears to have slowed in the early
part of 1985. Perhaps owing to cold weather in January, industrial
production (s.a.) dropped 4 percent, but it rose 8.2 percent (s.a.) in
February. The average level of industrial production in January and
February was slightly below the average level achieved in 1984, a year
of recovery for the Italian economy, and slightly below the monthly
average in the fourth quarter. The official February household survey
shows a slight decrease in consumer confidence about the general.
economic situation of the country.

In April, the cost of living index (not shown in table) was 8.8
percent above its year earlier level. No progress has been made in
reducing inflation over the last six months. The official goal of a 7
percent rate of inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, by
the end of 1985 appears increasingly unrealistic.
The current account deficit increased to $1.7 billion (n.s.a.) in
the fourth quarter of 1984 bringing the current account deficit to $3.2
billion for the year as a whole. More recently, the February trade
deficit was $1.0 billion (s.a.), a relatively large figure.
The National Bank of Belgium has changed its discount rate
policy in early May, seeking a closer alignment with market rates. The
discount rate, no longer a discretionary policy instrument, will be
fixed every Wednesday to equal the rate on three-month treasury
certificates set administratively the previous day. The discount rate
will be allowed to fluctuate within a specified range during the
following week. To reflect this new policy, the discount rate was
reduced within a week from 11 to 9.75 and further to 9.50 percent.
The Central Bank of Sweden raised its discount rate 2 percentage
points to 11.5 percent and increased its penalty rate 2.5 percentage
points to 16 percent. In addition, the government announced fiscal
measures designed to curb consumption and increase savings. These
changes are in response to the higher-than-expected current account
deficit and measured net capital outflows for the first quarter of
1985. The government's 1985 inflation goal has been jeopardized by
excessive wage demands by the civil servants union. In response to
these demands and selective strikes the government has imposed a
selective lockout on the civil servants.

Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Real output in non-OPEC developing countries grew by about 4 per-
cent in 1984, following virtual stagnation in 1982 and 1983. Their
aggregate external current account deficit declined by about $35 billion
and $10 billion, respectively, in 1983 and 1984 but now appears to be
running somewhat higher than in 1984. During the first quarter of 1985,
the trade surpluses of Mexico and Brazil dropped by $1.7 billion and
$0.5 billion, respectively, from their year-earlier levels.
Among OPEC countries, real output rose by about 1 percent in 1984.
GDP of the OPEC countries had declined by over 10 percent from 1979 to
1983, as cartel members cut back their volume of oil production and
world market conditions forced the reduction of oil prices.
In March, Mexico and the IMF reached new understandings on the
country's 1985 economic policies. Approval of the 1985 program by the
IMF Executive Board is expected on June 7. On the strength of these
understandings, the signing of the initial agreement under the multi-
year debt rescheduling took place on March 29. These developments
helped to calm the market for pesos outside Mexico despite continued
market skepticism over the slow rate of crawl of the peso in official
markets and a weaker trade balance. Economic activity has risen
strongly during the past six months, stimulating imports, depressing
exports, and bringing the merchandise trade surplus down to $2.6 billion
in the first quarter of 1985 from $4.3 billion a year earlier.
Negotiations between Brazil's new government and the IMF regarding
a 1985-86 stabilization program are expected to resume in late May and
may be protracted. Thus, Brazil is expected to request from commercial

IV-27
banks an extension of at least 90 days in the current agreement to main-
tain their interbank, trade credit, and redeposit facilities through
May 31. Brazil's trade surplus of $2.9 billion through the first four
months of 1985 compares with a $3.5 billion surplus during the same
period last year. It is likely that Brazil's trade surplus for the full
year 1985 will be $2-$3 billion lower than the $13 billion surplus
recorded in 1984. After an acceleration of inflation to a 12.7 percent
monthly rate in March, inflation dropped to 7.2 percent in April, in
large part because of new price controls.
Early in May, Argentina paid $50 million to its bank creditors to
eliminate public sector interest arrears for the period November 5-15,
1984, in order to avoid pushing interest arrears in excess of 180 days.
Banks have tentatively committed more than 98 percent of the $4.2
billion in new loans that had been agreed aspart of the package of new
financing and debt rescheduling arranged with the bank advisory commit-
tee last November. Argentina and the IMF are continuing negotiations
over reduction of the fiscal deficit and other steps needed to put the
Argentine stabilization program back on track. Progress so far has been
slow. Inflation has been accelerating, reaching about 30 percent in
April (2,200 percent at an annual rate). In mid-April, the Argentine
government submitted to the Congress 11 bills designed to increase
revenues by 0.5 percent of GDP. At the end of the month, the government
announced its decision to cut public sector expenditures by 12 percent
from the level proposed in an earlier budget and to submit to the
Congress three more tax bills, including one that would institute a
forced loan from taxpayers. Monetary conditions were also tightened

IV-28
substantially in late April and early May, leading to high real interest
rates in the uncontrolled segment of the loan market and a narrowing in
the spread between the official and parallel exchange rates from 37 to
about 13 percent. A major private bank (which had accounted for about 5
percent of total commercial bank deposits) was closed on May 10, leading
to a run on many other private, locally-owned banks in the country.
Venezuela and its bank advisory committee have completed the terms
sheet for the multi-year rescheduling agreement negotiated last Septem-
ber. Previous disagreements about provisions for currency switching of
dollar denominated debt, the obligation of the public sector to provide
foreign exchange to private sector debtors and the organization of a
re-lending facility have been resolved. The circulation of the terms
sheet to Venezuela's 450 creditor banks will probably begin in early
June. Before the final signing of the rescheduling agreement, however,
Venezuela must show further progress in the review for registration of
some $12 billion in private sector debt. About $10 billion of this
private sector debt has been reviewed so far, with about two-thirds
having been registered as eligible to obtain foreign exchange at a
preferential rate.
Chile's proposed three-year IMF extended arrangement is expected to
be approved by the Fund soon after Chile reaches agreement with its
major creditors on prospective balance-of-payments financing. The
Chileans are negotiating with bank and official creditors to fill a
1985-86 financing gap of nearly $2 billion. On May 4, Chile's bank
advisory committee offered $1.05 billion in new money, of which $250
million is proposed to be guaranteed by the World Bank. The banks are

IV-29
continuing to press for Chilean government guarantees to cover commer-
cial risks on the external debt of Chile's private financial sector.
In Peru, the president-elect's public statements suggest that he
may stop cooperating with the IMF and may seek to renegotiate the coun-
try's foreign debts without an IMF program. Creditors are concerned
about the possibility of the new government imposing a unilateral
rescheduling. In late 1984 the outgoing government began to implement a
series of adjustment measures-an acceleration of daily devaluations,
increases in gasoline prices, sales taxes, and interest rates, and a
slowdown of public investment projects. However, the announced measures
have not been fully implemented. Interest due to foreign commercial
banks is more than 180 days in arrears, and such arrears total about
$350 million. Peru made a payment of $22 million in mid-February. The
government announced its intention to make similar payments each month
for the remainder of the present administration's term, which ends
July 28, 1985, but in March only a $16 million payment was made, and no
payment was made in April.
Colombia appears to have gained acceptance by its bank creditors
for an alternative to a formal IMF standby arrangement, consisting of a
quantified adjustment program that would be monitored by the Fund but
would not involve any Fund resources. Colombia is seeking new loans
totalling $1 billion from the banks over two years; this would represent
a $300 million net increase in bank exposure after amortization payments
of $700 million which would be made on schedule.
At the end of March the Philippines exceeded by 3 percent the IMF
ceiling for reserve money (a type of monetary base concept) and breached

IV-30
two other performance targets under the IMF standby arrangement. How-
ever, in April the Fund Managing Director approved a revised standby
program which the Fund Board will consider on May 31. Under the new
program, the Philippines will be eligible to draw SDR 106 million toward
the end of June. In late April, the creditor banks finally assembled
their commitments to participate in the new, $925 million credit and the
$3 billion revolving short-term trade facility negotiated with the
Philippine authorities last fall.
