 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity apparently posted a small rise in the second quarter,
following a quarter of virtually no growth. Consumer spending has been
well-maintained despite a slowing in income growth, and construction in
both the residential and nonresidential areas remains strong. However,
outlays for producers' durable equipment have been sluggish for several
months, and industrial production continues to be damped by high levels of
imports. Recent increases in prices and wages have been small, after a
brief run-up earlier in the year.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
The index of industrial production declined somewhat in both April
and May and has shown little net change since the summer of 1984. Industries
that produce for defense and space programs have continued to expand
briskly this year, and strength in nonresidential construction and home
building has led to increased output of construction supplies in each of
the past three months. But output of other products and materials has
remained sluggish, with production of consumer goods little changed in
recent months and still about 1 percent below last summer's level. Also,
the production of business equipment--a source of growth throughout 1984--
has weakened in 1985, as the pace of output flattened for most types of
machinery and declines occurred in computers and mining equipment. Capacity
utilization slipped another 0.4 percentage point in May to 80.3 percent,
2-1/2 percentage points below the level of last July.

Employment and Unemployment
Despite the weakness in the industrial sector of the economy,
overall labor demand has continued to expand in recent months. Nonfarm
payroll employment increased 345,000 in May with most of the hiring again
occurring in trade, finance, and services. Since the beginning of the
year, job gains in this group of industries have accounted for almost all
of private nonfarm employment growth. Hiring has been particularly brisk
in the trade sector, where increases have averaged about 90,000 per month
since January, and in business services. Construction employment
also remained robust during the spring, reflecting strength in both
residential and nonresidential building activity.
In contrast, manufacturers reduced their payrolls further in May,
bringing the cumulative job loss since January to more than 160,000.
Cutbacks have been particularly large in the apparel and electrical
equipment industries. In some industries (steel, textiles, chemicals,
and petroleum products), the current level of employment is below that
reached at the trough of the recession in 1982.
As measured by the household survey, employment and unemployment were
little changed in May. The civilian jobless rate remained at 7.3 percent
for the fourth consecutive month--having moved little over the past year.
Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending has continued to grow rapidly, despite slower
income growth recently and reports of some slippage in consumer confidence
from its recovery highs. So far this year, gains in personal income
have averaged around $12 billion per month, or 4.7 percent at an
annual rate, compared with increases averaging $21 billion per month

during 1984. Much of the slowdown in income growth can be attributed to
the lack of growth in manufacturing payrolls and smaller increases in
personal interest income.
Despite the reduced income gains, nominal personal consumption
expenditures rose 0.7 percent in May, after an even stronger advance the
month before. Financing incentives on many domestic models and increased
supplies of Japanese cars boosted total auto sales to an 11.3 million
unit annual rate, the best monthly pace since April of 1979. Many of the
financing programs for domestic models were phased out by the end of May,
and sales of U.S. autos slowed. Among major types of discretionary
merchandise, outlays for furniture and appliances at retail stores rebounded
4.8 percent (not at an annual rate) in May, after declining in the two
preceding months, while spending for apparel and general merchandise was
1-1/2 percent above the first-quarter level.
The personal saving rate was 6.6 percent in May, boosted by the
delayed receipt of federal personal tax refunds. The refund, delays
have buffeted monthly estimates of disposable income and the saving
rate--lowering them in February-March and raising them in April-May. The
average saving rate for the first five months of this year, a measure
that should be relatively free of distortions from refund processing
problems, was 5.2 percent-nearly one percentage point less than the 1984
annual average.
Both the Conference Board index of confidence and the Michigan Survey
Research Center index of sentiment were lower in May than in April, and
both were noticeably below last summer's high levels. However, the
indexes are quite high and, in the Michigan survey, two-thirds of the

respondents thought it was a good time to buy a car--close to the all-time
peak reported one month earlier. Survey respondents expected consumer
prices to increase 4.7 percent during the next 12 months, within
the range of price expectations reported since mid-1983.
Business Fixed Investment
Growth in business fixed investment in recent months has been
concentrated in the structures area. The value of nonresidential construction
put in place rose 4.8 percent in April and another 0.9 percent in May,
with solid advances in virtually all major categories. For the first
five months of 1985, nonresidential construction has grown at almost a 35
percent annual rate, with both commercial and other building expanding at
about that same rate.
Outlays for producers' durable equipment appear to have revived a
bit after a dip in the first quarter. Shipments of nondefense capital
goods fell 3 percent between March and May; the decline probably reflects
a sharp drop in exports of capital goods while shipments to domestic
purchasers appear to have risen slightly. Imports of capital goods,
which have satisfied much of the rise in domestic equipment demand
throughout the expansion, edged down in both April and May.
New orders for nondefense capital goods rose 0.9 percent in May,
following a large drop in April and little growth in the first quarter.
On balance, new orders have been virtually flat since last fall. New
orders for computers and related equipment have been particularly volatile
since late last year; however-, these orders have shown little net change
over the past half-year. In contrast, the value of nonresidential building
contracts has continued to trend upward, albeit more slowly than earlier in
the expansion.

The Commerce Department's capital spending survey, conducted in
April and May, indicates that firms are still planning to increase nominal
plant and equipment outlays by roughly 9 percent in 1985. Moreover,
total capital appropriations (net of cancellations) for the nation's
1,000 largest manufacturers rose about 8-1/2 percent in the first quarter.
Business Inventories
On balance, the pace of business inventory investment remained
moderate into early spring. In manufacturing, stocks have remained low
relative to sales as firms have kept tight control over inventories and
responded quickly to weakness in orders. Indeed, book value data indicate
a sizable decline in factory stocks between March and May. In the trade
sector, auto dealers' stocks rose rapidly in the first quarter, but more
recently sales have outpaced production. Excluding autos, trade inventories
have generally continued to rise at a somewhat slower rate than during
1984. On balance, stocks do not appear to be excessive in the trade
sector, with the possible exception of nondurable retail outlets where
inventory-sales ratios have been on the high side of historical experience.
Housing
Housing demand appears to be quite strong. Although starts declined
in May, they averaged 1.8 million units (annual rate) in April and May--the
same as the elevated first-quarter pace. Moreover, newly-issued building
permits, which typically exhibit less monthly variation than starts,
continued to trend upward in May-reaching their highest level in almost
a year.
Activity in the multifamily sector has been particularly volatile in
recent months. Starts fell 20 percent in May and reversed much of the

upsurge of the preceding two months. For the first five months of 1985,
starts of multifamily units exceeded the strong 1984 pace, despite the
large number of units currently under construction and multifamily vacancy
rates that are at an 11-year high.
In the single-family sector, May's new home sales rebounded from
the weakness in April-returning to about the average of the first
quarter. In general, the recent decline in mortgage rates seems to be
stirring buyer interest. Early June trade reports suggested that builders'
expectations for sales already had improved noticeably.
Federal Sector
Federal receipts and outlays have both increased rapidly in the
current fiscal year, and the federal budget deficit has widened. At the
end of May, the unified budget deficit for the fiscal year was $16 billion
above year earlier levels. On the receipts side, delays in the processing
of individual income tax returns have distorted the monthly pattern of
receipts; however, the cumulative totals through May should show little
distortion from the refund delays. For the tax collection season as a
whole, net income tax settlements show a sizable increase because of a
$15 billion rise in estimated and final tax payments.
Regarding outlays, cyclically-sensitive spending has slowed, and
budget cuts have damped outlay growth for many nondefense discretionary
programs. This slowing has been offset by large increases in agricultural
price support programs and net interest. Defense spending continues to
lag to an unusual degree, relative to available spending authority.

II-13
In action toward a FY1986 congressional budget, the House passed its
budget resolution in late May. The House version would cut $56 billion
from the projected 1986 baseline deficit, $83 billion from the 1987 deficit,
and $120 billion from the 1988 deficit. The Senate had earlier approved
a budget resolution that proposed cuts of about the same amount from the
1986 deficit but somewhat larger cuts than the House version in both 1987
and 1988. In addition, there are substantial differences between the
House and Senate versions regarding how cuts ought to be achieved.
Exports and Imports
In May, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit rose $17 billion (annual
rate) and, for the April-May period combined, the deficit averaged about
$130 billion--roughly the same as the record level recorded in the third
quarter of last year. The widening of the deficit in the first two
months of the second quarter was attributable to a drop in exports, as
imports were essentially unchanged from their first-quarter level. The
decline in exports was fairly widespread by commodity category, with the
largest decreases coming in agricultural products, capital goods, and indus-
trial supplies. On the import side, a 10 percent rebound in oil imports
in April-May was fully offset by small declines in nonoil commodity cate-
gories. Nonetheless, nonoil imports in the first two months of the
second quarter continued to be very strong. (Further discussion of
international developments is included in Section IV.)

Prices
Recent inflation rates have been relatively moderate, after some
larger price increases earlier this year. The consumer price index rose
just 0.2 percent in May, as did the producer price index for finished
goods. So far in 1985, the overall CPI and the index excluding food and
energy have risen at about their 1984 paces-4 and 4-3/4 percent, respectively.
At both the producer and consumer levels, prices of commodities
other than food and energy changed little, on average, from March
through May. Declines were registered in consumer prices for new and
used cars and for apparel, following sizable increases in the first
quarter. In addition, producer prices of both consumer goods and capital
equipment have been relatively flat since March. Consumer prices of
nonenergy services, however, were up 0.7 percent in the May CPI--reflecting
mainly a jump in the volatile rental component. Over the first five
months of 1985, prices of nonenergy services have risen at about a 5-1/2
percent annual rate--the same as in 1984.
Food prices at the consumer level edged down in April and May,
as generally ample supplies led to declines in prices of meats, poultry,
and fresh fruits and vegetables. The index for the latter has nearly
retraced its weather-related upsurge of early 1985. Consumer energy
prices, which had risen sharply earlier in the year slowed to a 0.5
percent increase in May.
At earlier stages of processing, PPI prices of intermediate materials,
excluding food and energy items, advanced 0.2 percent in May on the
strength of an upturn in prices of construction materials. On balance,

II-16
though, this broad price index for domestically manufactured inputs to
production has edged down so far this year and is only slightly above its
year-earlier level. The producer price index of crude materials other than
food and energy also has declined further this year and now stands about
9 percent below its May 1984 level.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage increases appear to have been small in the second quarter. The
hourly earnings index for production and nonsupervisory workers in the
private nonfarm economy rose just 0.1 percent in May after a similar small
increase the month before. Earlier in the year, this measure of wage growth
had accelerated somewhat, mainly due to some sizable pay adjustments in
the manufacturing sector. In recent months, however, the rise in manufac-
turing wages has eased and the rate of wage increase in the service-producing
sector has continued to edge lower.
In the union sector, recent wage settlements on balance have been
small, and pressures to cut costs continue to be felt in some industries
that are susceptible to import or nonunion competition. For example, new
agreements in the apparel industry, which cover roughly 200,000 union
members, call for an initial wage freeze. And settlements at several
airlines, including United, have instituted two-tier pay scales, with lower
entry salaries for newly-hired pilots. Also, a tentative settlement has
been reached with the largest of the unions representing railroad workers--the
United Transportation Union-calling for essentially COLA-only wage
increases over the next three years.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
M1 continued to expand at an exceptionally rapid pace in June, moving
still further above the band associated with the FOMC's 1985 target range.
The strength in narrow money contributed in turn to faster growth in the
broader aggregates, which also were buoyed by more vigorous increases in
such non-M1 components as MMDAs and money market mutual fund shares.
The persistence of brisk growth in M1, coupled with unanticipated
firmness in some key economic indicators, led to a partial reversal after
mid-June of a credit market rally that had been based heavily on expectations
of another cut in the discount rate to stimulate business activity. Yields
on most private short-term market instruments have declined slightly on
balance since the May FOMC meeting; Treasury bill rates, however, have
fallen about 40 basis points, apparently reflecting in part some shift in
investor preferences in light of concerns about the banking system. Bond
rates, perhaps influenced more by developments in petroleum markets and
implications for future inflationary pressures, have posted declines compa-
rable to those in bill rates, thus maintaining a steep yield curve. Home
mortgage rates, catching up with the rally in other markets, are off approxi-
mately 3/4 of a percentage point.
While nominal interest rates have declined substantially since mid-1984,
approaching 1978 or 1979 levels, estimates based on surveys of inflation
expectations indicate that real interest rates have declined somewhat less.
Indeed, real long-term rates remain considerably above past norms (see chart
on page 111-2).
Aggregate borrowing by nonfinancial corporations appears to have
been heavy in June and in the second quarter as a whole, even though the

gap between capital outlays and internal funds remained moderate. Issuance
of long-term bonds surged to a record volume last month, partly in connection
with mergers, buyouts, and share repurchases. In the household sector,
credit growth apparently remaind sizable through the spring--most markedly
in the consumer installment credit area, but with mortgage credit demand
reportedly strengthening recently in response to lower interest rates.
Borrowing by state and local governments has been quite strong, boosted by
a heavy volume of refundings. The federal government also stepped up its
borrowing during the second quarter, building its cash balance in the process.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 growth accelerated sharply in May to a 14 percent annual rate,
and was still more rapid in June.1 The strength in money demand, which has
exceeded model predictions, has encompassed all of the major components of
M1. Tax refunds/payments and gyrations in Treasury cash balances do not
appear to have been a significant factor in the M1 pattern. The publicity
given to improper cash management practices by E. F. Hutton also appears not
to have significantly affected holdings of M1 balances by other corporations.
M2 increased at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate in May, and accelerated
further in June to edge above the upper end of its 6-to-9 percent 1985 tar-
get cone. Some of the pickup in M2 growth in May was accounted for by its
M1 components, but a sharp rise in overnight RPs also was important; the
latter development appeared to be associated with financing of increased
Treasury security holdings that were acquired by banks. The further
acceleration of M2 in June can be traced in large part to faster growth in

retail deposits and a swing to expansion of money funds, owing to the
lagging adjustment of returns to declining market rates.
In the retail deposit category, a pickup in MMDAs more than offset a
slowdown in small time deposits--a pattern consistent with a flattening of
the yield curve of offering rates during May and June. Savings deposits
expanded in May at the fastest rate since the introduction of MMDAs, and
this development continued in June.
After rising at a 7-1/2 percent annual rate in May, M3 growth
quickened in June, although its non-M2 component continued to expand
slowly. M3 ended the first half of 1985 in the upper portion of its 6-to-
9-1/2 percent growth rate target range. Among the non-M2 components of M3,
only institutional money market mutual funds and large time deposits at
thrifts have risen since April. The large time deposit component of M3 was
about flat in May and down somewhat in June as runoffs at commercial banks
more than offset growth at thrifts. Greater core deposit inflows and some-
what weaker credit growth lessened bank needs for managed liabilities in
June. Expansion in large CDs at thrifts reportedly may be traced to their
efforts to shift away from very short-term sources of funds such as RPs
into liabilities with maturities of six months or more.
Growth in total loans and investments at commercial banks, after
accelerating markedly in May, slowed in June, largely reflecting a reduced
pace of security acquisitions. Loan growth was slightly less rapid in June
than in May or in the first quarter. Real estate lending continued at its
recent substantial clip, but consumer loans decelerated over May and June,
perhaps reflecting concessionary terms on auto loans offered by major
automobile finance companies. Business loans booked domestically grew

moderately during the past two months, but loans booked at foreign branches
increased sharply--likely owing to a relatively wide interest differential
favoring LIBOR over prime-based pricing. (The prime rate was cut from 10
to 9-1/2 percent in mid-June). Taken together, domestic plus foreign branch
loans to businesses grew at a pace in May and June roughly in line with the
moderate rate of the first four months of the year. Issuance of commercial
paper by nonfinancial business slowed in June from the substantial volume
of the previous two months.
Business Finance
Since the last FOMC meeting, corporate bond yields have declined
nearly 1/2 percentage point, to five-year lows. Yield spreads between
long-term corporates and Treasuries have remained near their lowest levels
of the last six years. Corporate bond issuance attracted by the lower
level of interest rates has been extremely large in the past two months.
A large proportion of this volume has financed the net absorption of equities
in mergers, buyouts, and share repurchase programs, although some of the
long-term borrowing has been motivated by a desire to repay loans and
short-term paper.
The volume of bond offerings by U.S. corporations soared to an all-
time high in June, on the heels of strong issuance earlier in the spring.
Bonds issued to finance exchanges for equity shares represented more than
half of the estimated $10 billion of nonfinancial bond offerings in domestic
markets in June. Borrowing by financial firms also has been sizable as May
volume surpassed the April record, and June also was large; among the
financial company issues in May were two publicly offered bonds backed by
auto loans, another step in the "securitization" of credit.

Issuance of corporate bonds has been concentrated more in the domestic
market recently as Euromarket borrowing has eased off some from the higher
volume of the previous two quarters, reflecting the more favorable rates
available domestically. It also has been concentrated in the short and
intermediate maturities; and with the recent stock market gains, a large
proportion of longer-term issues has been convertible into equity. Issuance
of low-and unrated bonds by both financial and nonfinancial firms also picked
up in the second quarter after a comparative lull in the first quarter.
Corporate borrowing in the tax-exempt market remained weak throughout the
first half of the year, after the surge of issues that preceded imposition
at the beginning of this year of more stringent arbitrage restrictions and
limits on bond issues for industrial development.
New equity issues expanded during the second quarter, boosted by
higher stock prices. However, owing to mergers and financial restruc-
turing, net share retirements in the second quarter are estimated to have
been nearly $75 billion at an annual rate for the nonfinancial sector, some-
what below the level of the first quarter and roughly equal to the volume
last year. During June, when several broad stock price indexes registered
new highs, equity issuance picked up to about $3.8 billion, the largest
monthly volume since November 1983.
U.S. Government Securities Markets
The combined (on- and off-budget) federal deficit in the April-to-
June quarter is estimated by the staff at about $36 billion. The deficit
is expected to widen again to about $55 billion in the current quarter.
During the second quarter, the Treasury borrowed a net $38-1/2 billion in the
market and raised another $6-1/2 million from nonmarketable issues--mostly

securities specially tailored for state and local governments as a temporary
repository for proceeds from tax-exempt refunding bonds. With borrowing in
excess of current needs, the Treasury cash balance grew by $10 billion.
The end-of-quarter financing, to settle in early July, raised $14
billion of new money, and thus made considerable progress toward covering
third-quarter cash needs. During the third quarter, the Treasury is expected
to maintain its cash balance at about the current level in anticipation of
heavy fourth-quarter financing needs.
Net borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies surged to
more than $6 billion in the second quarter. The Federal Home Loan Banks
accounted for much of this volume. There was a substantial increase in
demand by thrift institutions for advances, as they reportedly sought to
reduce reliance on brokered deposits and RPs and to take advantage of
recent lower interest rates available on longer-term advances. FNMA also
borrowed heavily, to fund mortgage purchases.
The Farm Credit Banks reduced their outstanding debt further during the
second quarter, as FCB loan volume continued to decline. Production Credit
Associations (PCAs) which lend directly to agricultural producers have
experienced severe pressures owing to increasing loan losses; their lending
has trended down as more creditworthy borrowers have tended to obtain
financing elsewhere at more attractive rates. Accordingly, demands for
credit from the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks--which are part of the Farm
Credit Bank System and the primary source of funds for PCAs--have fallen off.

1. Does not include tax-exempt commercial paper.
2. Includes all refunding bonds, not just advance refundings.
Borrowing was stimulated by the downtrend in municipal bond yields
in May and early June. Since then, municipal rates, like other market
rates, have backed up a bit. By late June, the Bond Buyer 30-year revenue
index was 10 basis points below its level at the time of the May FOMC
meeting, and about 100 basis points below its recent high in March. The net
decline in municipal bond rates during the intermeeting period has been
less than for taxable bonds, probably as a result of the heavy supply of
refunding bonds coming to market.
The increased volume of refunding bonds does appear to reflect mainly
the current low level of rates; market reports suggest that the proposed
ban on advance refundings in the President's tax reform program has played
little, if any, role. A substantial share of the refundings has been
undertaken by public power authorities. Proceeds of many recent refundings
will not be used to refinance outstanding issues until the early 1990s,
when the initial call dates are reached.

III-13
Trading began on June 11 in a new municipal bond futures contract at
the Chicago Board of Trade. The value of this contract is based on a new
index, compiled by the Bond Buyer, of prices of a continually changing
set of 40 recently offered, actively traded tax-exempt issues. The
contract itself has been trading actively since its introduction; trading
to date reportedly has been strongly dominated by speculators, as is usually
the case with new contracts.
Mortgage Markets
Before turning up in the latter part of June, home mortgage rates had
fallen markedly after the last FOMC meeting, reaching the lowest levels in
several years. In the primary market, contract rates on new conventional
fixed-rate loan commitments at S&Ls are down 115 basis points from their
recent peak in late March, and the ceiling rate on standard VA-guaranteed
loans was lowered to 11.5 percent, effective June 5, the third cut in two
months. Yield declines have been smaller in the secondary market, where
they tended to match developments in the bond market.
Adjustable-rate home loans continue to offer substantial initial rate
advantages as compared with fixed-rate loans, consistent with the steepness
of the yield curve in securities markets. Despite an initial rate advantage of
more than 2 percentage points, however, ARMs in recent months have accounted
for only half of all home loans originated, compared with a high of two-thirds
reached in mid-1984. The general reduction in interest rates since late 1984
appears partly responsible for the reduced share, as lower costs of credit
have allowed home buyers to afford both a house and the certainty of a fixed-
rate loan. Higher premiums and more selective underwriting standards for
private mortgage insurance on ARMs also may have been contributing factors.

As interest rates have moderated, growth in residential mortgage debt
appears to have picked up slightly over the spring from the first-quarter
pace. New issues of federally related mortgage pass-through securities
rebounded in May to their largest volume in two years, with both FHLMC and
GNMA issuance up sharply. All Freddie Mac securities and almost all of the
GNMA securities were backed by fixed-rate loans; pass-through securities
collateralized by adjustable-rate mortgages have not been well received to
date by investors, in part because of the caps on annual rate adjustments
on the underlying mortgages. Thrifts, by contrast, have continued to
account for a smaller than usual share of net mortgage lending. Mortgage-
related assets at FSLIC-insured institutions grew only 2 percent in the
first five months of this year, compared with 7 percent during the
same period in 1984.
The net worth regulations that became effective in the first quarter
of 1985 have been the major factor in damping thrift asset growth, according
to industry observers. Thrifts have been originating mortgages at a brisk
pace, but many of these loans have then been sold. Furthermore, thrifts
have continued to be net sellers of mortgage-backed securities, as lower
interest rates since March have allowed institutions to realize capital
gains by liquidating assets acquired when rates were higher.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit evidently grew rapidly in May, perhaps
at about the elevated pace of the first four months of the year. Robust
auto sales, stimulated in part by concessionary finance rates offered on
some new-car models by the captive auto finance companies, likely con-
tributed heavily to the May credit expansion. Delays in distributing

federal income tax refund checks probably had boosted installment credit
earlier in the year, but the more recent catch-up may have restrained
credit expansion to a degree in May and perhaps in June.
As household debt has continued to grow rapidly, it appears that
consumers in the aggregate have experienced more difficulty in making
timely payments on their loans. At commercial banks, the delinquency rate
on consumer installment loans increased sharply during the first quarter,
although it remained slightly below the average for the past ten years.
Auto loan delinquencies at captive finance companies also continued to rise
from the relatively low levels of last fall. Delinquent mortgage loans,
already high, climbed to a record level during the first quarter, according
to a Mortgage Bankers Association series covering a cross-section of lenders;
a FHLBB series for S&Ls also reached a record high in May.
Information about delinquency experience on consumer loans at commer-
cial banks, developed from the June Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey,
suggests that little further deterioration occurred during the second
quarter. For the most part, loan officers judged their level of delin-
quencies in June to be somewhat below the norm of the past ten years.
On balance, the step-up in delinquencies so far in 1985 does not
appear to have reduced the willingness of commercial banks to make consumer
loans. To the contrary, continuing the pattern of the past couple of years,
a high proportion of bank respondents in the June survey reported equal or
greater willingness to lend to consumers, as compared with three months
earlier.
Under these circumstances, interest rates on consumer loans at
commercial banks have been cut somewhat, although they have continued to

lag declines in market rates generally. On new-car loans, the spread between
bank rates and yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities in early
May was at about the middle of its range of the past dozen years. As
market rates rose between mid-1983 and mid-1984, consumer rates had
remained essentially stable, resulting in a narrowing yield spread. The
more recent decline in market rates--with consumer rates still relatively
stable--has restored a more typical yield relationship.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted value of the dollar has depreciated by about 1
percent on balance since the last FOMC meeting, as shown in the top panel
of the chart. The dollar has continued to fluctuate in response to
shifting assessments of the strength of U.S. economic activity and the
stance of U.S. monetary policy, although the magnitude of these
fluctuations has been less pronounced than earlier in the year. At its
current level the dollar's weighted average exchange value is about 10
percent below its peak of late February.
The gap between U.S. short-term interest rates and the average
level of short-term interest rates abroad has also showed little net
change since the last FOMC meeting, with both series easing slightly on
balance over the period, as shown in the bottom panel of the chart.
German short-term interest rates have eased further as the Bundesbank has
continued to supply substantial liquidity to the market through
repurchase agreements undertaken at reduced rates.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
U.S. international transactions data for April indicate a net
inflow of $3.5 billion reported by U.S. banking offices, private
foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities totalling $3.9
billion, and a small increase in foreign official reserve holdings in
the United States following a large decline in the first quarter: see
the Summary Table on U.S. International Transactions. The resumption
in April of strong private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities included net purchases of $1-1/2 billion by Japanese
residents and more than $1 billion by the World Bank. Each of these
two purchasers acquired, net, about $5-1/2 billion of Treasury
securities during 1984 and 1985Q1, accounting between them for nearly
half of the $29 billion in total private foreign net purchases since
the beginning of 1984.
Japanese securities houses are understood to have acquired around
three-quarters of the $1 billion in foreign targeted notes (FTNs) that
the Treasury auctioned in early June. The Treasury was able to auction
that issue at a yield 19 basis points below the yield on the companion
domestic security. It is not clear that the FTNs were acquired for
Japanese investors, however, since major Japanese investors (e.g.,
trust banks and life insurance companies) would appear to have no
interest in anonymity and can obtain higher yields by acquiring other
U.S. Treasury securities. Nevertheless, the fact that the two
previously issued FTNs have both been trading in secondary markets,
since mid-April, at yields averaging 20 to 40 basis points less than
their domestic companion issues suggests that the Japanese securities

houses could have expected to profit from buying up the third FTN. The
opening up of those yield differentials followed a five-month period
beginning in mid-November, about two weeks after the first FTN auction,
during which the differentials remained narrow enough to encourage
substantial exchanges of FTNs for domestic companion securities. In
fact, the exchange option was exercised on about one-fourth of the
auctioned volumes of each of the first two FTN issues; those
conversions have essentially ceased as the yield differentials have
opened.
Another component of the U.S. net capital inflow in recent months
has been the continuing decline in the Eurodollar holdings of U.S.
nonbank residents: see line 5 of the International Banking Data Table.
Most of the decline since March 1984 has occurred at the foreign
branches of the 16 largest U.S. banks. This shift appears related to
funding decisions by the large banks. A recent Annual Report of one of
those banks, for example, states that in managing its liabilities, the
bank has sought to reduce its traditional reliance on wholesale money
markets as sources of funds, in part because new sources of funds have
become available through deregulation and the creation of retail
deposits without interest rate ceilings (in particular, money market
deposit accounts).
Data as of the end of March have recently become available on the
consolidated claims on foreigners of the domestic and foreign offices
of U.S.-chartered banks. The change in those claims during the first

quarter was negligible. Over the 12 months to the end of March, U.S.
banks' foreign claims declined by 6 percent. This mainly reflected the
effects of the higher exchange rate of the dollar on the stock of
nondollar claims, as well as reductions in dollar interbank placements
as banks made efforts to improve their capital/asset ratios. Claims on
every borrowing group decreased, the drop being proportionately largest
for claims on G-10 countries (8 percent) and smallest for claims on
non-OPEC developing countries (1 percent). However, net new lending to
non-OPEC developing countries in the 12 months ending in March may have
been slightly positive, perhaps equivalent to about 2 percent of
outstandings, because outstandings were reduced by various factors --
loan charge-offs, sales of claims to nonbanks, exercise of official
guarantees, and exchange rate changes -- in addition to repayments by
borrowers.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In May, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was larger than that
recorded in April. For the April-May period combined, the deficit
reached the record level of the third quarter of last year.
The increase in the deficit for April from the first quarter was
attributable to a decline in exports. By commodity category, the drop
in exports was fairly widespread, with the largest declines coming in
agricultural exports, capital goods and industrial supplies.
The drop in agricultural exports was largely in corn and soybeans
with a notable decline also in cotton. At the present time, the
largest markets for U.S. corn are the U.S.S.R. and Japan. World

supplies of corn and soybeans are ample, reflecting very good harvests
in the Southern Hemisphere. Argentina is exporting a record amount of
soybeans, and soybean exports by Brazil are strong also. U.S. cotton
exports are facing strong competition from cotton exported by Pakistan
and China.
Many of the industrial supplies export items that recorded
decreases in the April-May period also declined in the first quarter;
these include chemicals, fuel oil, paper, gold and steelmaking
materials. The reduction in exports of capital goods was fairly
broadly spread among various categories of machinery. Exports of
commercial aircraft declined from a high first-quarter rate.
Imports in the April-May period were about unchanged from the
first quarter rate. Increases in oil imports, passenger cars from
Japan, trucks, aircraft and coffee were offset by declines in a wide
range of other major commodity categories. Decreases were recorded in
machinery (particularly office machines and other electronic items),
steel, clothing, diamonds, gold and agricultural products other than
coffee.
Oil imports averaged 5 million barrels per day in the April-May
period, about 10 percent more than the relatively low first-quarter
rate. Most of the additional imports appear to have been added to
inventories. The price of imported oil averaged $26.95 per barrel in
April-May, up marginally from the first-quarter average. In mid-April,
world spot market prices, for crude oil and products, began a decline
that continued through June. These declines will be reflected in
import prices with a lag of about two months.

U.S. Current Account: 1985-Q1
The U.S. current account was in deficit by $120 billion, SAAR, in
the first quarter of 1985; this was an $18 billion larger deficit than
in the previous quarter. Most of the increase in the deficit was
attributable to merchandise trade -- imports expanded and exports
declined a bit. In addition, net portfolio income declined (primarily
a reduction in private income receipts). Partly offsetting the trade
and net portfolio income results were an increase in military sales to
foreigners, a reduction in military expenditures abroad, a reduction in
U.S. government grants to developing countries, and a small increase in
net receipts from other services. See the table on the following page.

Foreign Economic Developments. First quarter figures for real
gross national product showed few-signs of increased vigor in the major
foreign industrial economies. The rate of economic growth slowed
sharply in Japan in the first quarter, although recent data on
industrial production suggest that part of this decline is temporary.
The level of economic activity fell in Germany and was flat in France,
in part the result of an exceptionally severe winter. Although Canada,
Italy, and the United Kingdom continue to experience moderate economic
growth, only in Canada was this growth sufficient to effect a reduction
in the unemployment rate. Unemployment in Europe remains very high.
Inflation rates in the major industrial countries have remained
broadly unchanged in recent months except in the United Kingdom, where
increases in mortgage rates and indirect taxes contributed to a rise in
the retail price index. In Italy, the government won an important
victory when the referendum to reinstate lost wage indexation points
was defeated, eliminating a potential additional source of inflationary
pressure.
The current account surpluses of Japan, Germany, and the United
Kingdom have increased during 1985, in the case of Japan to a record
rate. The trade balances of Italy and France remain in deficit and the
Italian external position is showing signs of further deterioration.
Individual Country Notes. Although the pace of economic activity
in Japan slowed sharply in the first quarter, later indicators point to
a continued healthy expansion, though at a slower pace than occurred
last year. Real GNP rose by only 0.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter, following a 9.9 percent jump in the fourth quarter. Erratic

IV-16
swings in investment and exports account for the sharp swings in real
output. On the positive side, real private consumption in the first
quarter rose by almost 4 percent, more than double the rate of increase
in the previous quarter. New housing starts were up by 6-1/2 percent
in the first four months of 1985 from the corresponding period of last
year. Industrial production increased sharply in April and May after a
0.6 percent decline in the first quarter. Also, the May survey of the
Bank of Japan reported that major Japanese companies are planning a
10.8 percent increase in investment in the current fiscal year (which
began April 1); the February survey showed an expected gain of only 5.2
percent for fiscal 1985.
Price increases continue to be modest. In the three months
ending in June the Tokyo consumer price index rose by about 2 percent
from the corresponding period of last year. The current account
surplus continues to grow: in the first four months of this year, the
current account surplus was about $40 billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with
a $32 billion surplus for the corresponding period of last year.
Japan's external balance is expected to continue to increase, in part
because of the almost 25 percent higher quota on automobile exports to
the United States for the current fiscal year and because of the
expected resumption of export growth to China.
Prime Minister Nakasone is expected to announce by mid-July the
final version of his "Action Program" that is intended to increase the
openness of the Japanese economy. The program is to be implemented
over a three-year period and is expected to include tariff reductions
as well as the easing of some non-tariff barriers. One part of the

IV-17
program will consist of tariff reductions in 1986 and 1987 on a wide
range of manufactured and agricultural products. Japanese officials
are reported to be concerned that the program will be perceived as
insufficient by its trading partners.
Real GNP in Germany declined 3.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter to a level only 0.6 percent above the first quarter of 1984.
Since December, the rate of unemployment has increased from 9 percent
(s.a.) to about 9-1/2 percent. The source of weakness has been
domestic demand. In association with stagnating disposable incomes,
private consumption expenditures fell, as did public consumption as a
result of continued fiscal restraint. Investment also declined as a
sharp fall in the construction sector, in part the result of an
unusually severe winter, swamped a strong increase in investment in
equipment. Recent data on order volumes, however, suggest that the
first-quarter slump in economic activity may have been, at least in
part, a largely weather-related deviation from a moderate growth path.
After declining in April, the index of industrial production rose
moderately in May to about its fourth-quarter average.
Consumer prices rose less than 0.1 percent in June to a level 2.5
percent above June 1984. The 12-month inflation rate has been 2.5
percent for the past four months.
The current account surplus was $1.9 billion in May for a
cumulative $4.5 billion (n.s.a.) surplus so far this year. This
compares to a cumulative $1.7 billion (n.s.a.) surplus for the same
period of last year. The volume of exports in the first quarter was
almost 8 percent above its year-earlier level.

IV-18
On July 2 Finance Minister Stoltenberg announced that the cabinet
has approved the draft of the 1986 budget. The government is holding
to its fiscal plans, according to which a sizeable tax cut is to occur
in two installments, in 1986 and in 1988, despite growing pressure to
consolidate the tax cut in 1986. Limited measures will also be
introduced to stimulate construction.
Economic activity in France has remained weak in recent months.
Industrial production in April declined by 2.2 percent (s.a.), more
than reversing the increase of the previous month, and leaving
industrial production only 1.6 percent above its year-earlier level.
Real GDP showed no increase in the first quarter and was up by only 0.5
percent on a year-over-year basis. The unemployment rate increased
slightly in April to a near-record 10.6 percent. Consumer prices
increased by 0.5 percent (s.a.) in May and were 6.5 percent above their
year-earlier level. After decreasing each month last year, the year-
over-year consumer price inflation rate has remained nearly unchanged
at 6-1/2 percent so far this year.
The trade account was in deficit by $130 million (s.a.) in May,
following a deficit of nearly $500 million the previous month. For the
first five months of 1985, the trade deficit rate was $4 billion
(s.a.a.r.), compared with the $5 billion deficit rate in the
corresponding period last year. The current account was in deficit by
$700 million (s.a.) in the first quarter, following surpluses in the
third and fourth quarters last year.
On July 2 the Bank of France announced new measures designed to
reduce above-target money supply growth. The measures include a

IV-19
reduction in recourse to monetary financing by the Treasury,
restrictions on firms' foreign currency borrowings, and a 1.5 percent
reduction in the ceilings used to determine banks' excess credit
growth. As of May, year-over-year growth in M2R was 7.4 percent, above
the 4 percent to 6 percent monetary target range for this year.
Real gross domestic product (average measure) grew 3.2 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the United Kingdom in the first quarter of 1985.
Investment growth was particularly strong as corporations advanced
capital expenditure plans before the rates of depreciation allowable
for tax purposes were reduced on April 1. The industrial production
index rose 0.9 percent (s.a.) in April to reach its highest level since
December, 1979. This growth, however, was not sufficient to reduce the
unemployment rate, which remained at 13.1 percent (s.a.) in May.
The year-over-year rate of increase in the retail price index was
7 percent in May, up about 2 percentage points from January. One-time
changes in the price level, reflecting earlier increases in mortgage
rates and indirect taxes, account for part of the increase in measured
inflation. The trade account was in surplus in May, the first time in
over a year, and the current account was in substantial surplus. The
cumulative current account surplus for the first five months of the
year was $2.6 billion (s.a.a.r.). In 1984, the current account was in
near balance.
On May 22 the Bank of England announced a technical change in the
definition of its monetary target ranges. Instead of setting the
target as the growth rate from some base level, the Bank will now apply
the target to the 12-month growth rates of the targeted aggregate for

IV-20
each month during the target period. The monetary targets remained
unchanged at 3-7 percent annual growth for MO and 5-9 percent for
£M3. In May, MO was within its target range while the 12-month
growth rate for £M3 was 12.2 percent, about 3 percent age points
above the top of its target range.
Real GNP in Canada increased 3.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter of 1985 after a slightly smaller gain in the final quarter of
1984. Inventory accumulation and personal consumption expenditures
showed large increases. Business investment, however, was little
changed for the fifth consecutive quarter. In May the Canadian
unemployment rate fell to 10.5 percent, a decline of 0.6 percentage
points from the first-quarter average.
Inflation in Canada continued to be moderate. The consumer price
index increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in May, and was 4
percent above last year's level. Meanwhile, the current account
surplus was $0.5 billion (s.a.) in the first quarter of 1985, a decline
from the fourth-quarter surplus of $0.9 billion, but matching last
year's average quarterly pace. The trade surplus declined in April,
but continued to show a sizable surplus of $1.6 billion (s.a.).
The new conservative government in Canada presented its first
budget to Parliament on May 24. Finance Minister Michael Wilson
projected that new tax and spending measures would reduce the Federal
deficit to 7.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 1985-86, from 8.4 percent of
GDP in fiscal 1984-85. Most of the deficit reduction results from
outlay reductions.

IV-21
Real GNP in Italy rose 2.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter after a relatively weak fourth quarter. Industrial production
in April was 3 percent (s.a.) higher than its year-earlier level.
Official household surveys held in March, April, and May show on
average a slight weakening of consumer confidence about the general
economic situation of the country.
In June, the cost of living index was 8.7 percent above its year-
earlier level, an inflation rate broadly unchanged since November.
However, on June 9 and 10, the Italian electorate rejected a referendum
sponsored by the Italian Communist Party designed to reinstate the wage
indexation points lost during the seven-month freeze in 1984. This
vote underscores the public's general approval of the economic policies
of Prime Minister Craxi's coalition government.
The trade deficit in April was $1.4 billion (s.a.). Italy's
cumulative quarterly trade deficit for the first four months of this
year was $5.4 billion (s.a.), and there is increasing concern that the
current account will register an uncomfortably large deficit in 1985.

IV-22
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Declining interest rates on international markets since mid-1984
are beginning to reduce substantially the debt-service requirements of
developing countries that have large floating-interest debts to banks.
The decline in LIBOR since the summer of 1984, together with negotiation
of lower interest spreads under debt rescheduling agreements, is likely
to reduce the average interest cost on LIBOR-based debt to about a 9-1/2
percent annual rate during the second half of 1985. In comparison, the
average interest cost of such debt was about 12 percent in 1984. Never-
theless, important political factions in a number of Latin American
countries continue to urge joint action by major debtors to limit their
external interest payments to some reduced fraction of their countries'
annual export earnings.
The decline in world oil prices is further relieving the balance of
payments pressure on three major debtors-Brazil, Chile, and the
Philippines--that have experienced a protracted period of austerity and
adjustment but have avoided so far a pattern of serious delinquencies on
their external debt. For Mexico, however, the decline in oil export
earnings is expected to account for about one-third of the likely $5
billion deterioration in its merchandise trade surplus from 1984 to
1985.
In mid-June, Argentina reached agreement with the IMF on deep cuts
in the fiscal deficit and introduced a sweeping monetary reform. These
moves signal an important breakthrough toward resolution of the serious
internal and external financial problems that have plagued Argentina
since 1982. Although further fiscal adjustments by the Argentine

IV-23
government will be required, the IMF Exeuctive Board is expected to
approve the agreement in early August.
The central commitment by the Argentine government in its prelimi-
nary agreement with the IMF is to reduce the nonfinancial fiscal deficit
from 8-1/2 percent of GDP in 1984 to about 2-1/2 percent by the fourth
quarter of 1985. Most of the requisite fiscal measures were taken in
May and June, including a 10 percent import surcharge, increases in
export taxes by 7-10 percentage points, and sharp increases in fuel and
utility prices. The monetary reform program announced on June 14 is
designed to achieve a rapid deceleration of inflation through a wage and
price freeze, a new currency (called the austral) that initially has
been held to a fixed rate against the dollar, and an end to central bank
financing of the government deficit. Before the reform was announced,
credit policy had been tightened to produce highly positive real
interest rates, and the currency had been devalued by 15.3 percent
against the dollar. The IMF Executive Board will consider this program
in early August as a basis for reinstatement of Argentina's existing
$1.2 billion stand-by agreement, which runs until March 1986. The
reinstatement of the IMF agreement is expected to allow activation of
the $4.2 billion credit from foreign banks negotiated in late 1984-
with disbursements of $2.2 billion to begin in mid September.
In view of these developments, the United States and 11 other
countries agreed in mid-June to provide $483 million in bridge finan-
cing. The bridge loan is expected to be repaid from IMF disbursements
in mid-August and late September. On June 12, Argentina paid $250
million from its reserves to the banks. Another $320 million, drawn

IV-24
from the bridge loan, was paid during the last few days of June,
bringing interest current up to February 28. While reaction of the
Argentine public to the government program has been generally favorable,
effective implementation of the program is not assured. Federal bank
supervisors are advising U.S. banks to use conservative accounting
treatment for interest payments received through October.
In late May and again in late June, Mexico's peso came under
renewed pressure in U.S. markets on rumors of a speedup of peso devalua-
tion, speculation about further weakening in oil prices, and possibly
unease about the government's willingness to take fiscal measures needed
to conform with the stabilization program approved by the IMF on June 7.
In U.S. markets the peso sold at a discount of about 20 percent from the
controlled rate through most of June, dropping to a discount of 23
percent by July 2. On June 17, Mexico reduced the export price of its
heavy grade of crude oil by $1.50 per barrel after experiencing a sharp
decline in the volume of crude lifted by its customers in preceding
weeks. The merchandise trade surplus may amount to only about $9
billion in 1985, down from $14 billion in 1984. On the other hand, net
interest payments may decline by up to $1-1/2 billion in 1985. Mexico's
IMF-approved program for 1985 calls for reduction of the public sector
deficit to 4.1 percent of GDP from 6.2 percent in 1984, but this result
is unlikely to be achieved unless substantial new measures are taken
after the congressional, state and municipal elections on July 7.
Mexico's consumer prices rose by 2.4 percent in May, the smallest
monthly increase since 1981, and stood about 55 percent higher than a
year earlier. Interest rates on short-term deposits, which had been

IV-25
raised to positive real levels in March, were increased significantly
further in late May and in June, and now result in positive real yields
of 5-10 percent annually on short-term deposits and Treasury bills.
Ongoing negotiations between Brazil's new government and the IMF
regarding a 1985-86 standby arrangement are expected to be protracted.
The main sticking point in the present negotiations with the IMF con-
tinues to be the allowable size of the fiscal deficit, which has
increased significantly in the past few months, in great part because of
a 3-1/2 month freeze on the prices of industrial products, including
those produced by state enterprises. At the end of May, commercial
banks granted Brazil's request for an extension through August in the
life of the interbank, trade credit, and redeposit facilities. Infla-
tion has receded to an average monthly rate of about 7.5 percent during
the April-June period after averaging 12 percent during the first three
months of the year. This improvement reflects the impact of price
controls and does not appear sustainable.
Venezuela and its bank advisory committee have completed the terms
sheet for the multi-year rescheduling agreement negotiated last
September. Previous disagreements about provisions for currency switch-
ing of dollar denominated debt, the obligation of the public sector to
provide foreign exchange to private sector debtors, and the organization
of a re-lending facility have been resolved. The circulation of the
terms sheet to Venezuela's 450 creditor banks began in early June, and
Venezuelan authorities hope to have the final agreement signed by
October. Before the final signing of the rescheduling agreement, how-
ever, Venezuela must show further progress in the review for registra-

IV-26
tion of some $12 billion in private sector debt. About $10-1/2 billion
of this private sector debt has been reviewed so far, with about $7-1/2
billion having been registered as eligible to obtain foreign exchange at
a preferential rate.
Chile reached agreement on June 27 with its bank advisory committee
regarding rescheduling of bank debt falling due during 1985-87, mainte-
nance of trade credit facilities, and new loans, partly guaranteed by
the World Bank, totalling $1.085 billion during 1985-86. Chile's
proposed three-year IMF extended arrangement is now expected to be
approved by the Fund in mid-July.
In Peru, the president-elect Garcia's public statements suggest
that he will seek to renegotiate the country's foreign debts without
parallel efforts to negotiate with the IMF on Peru's economic stabili-
zation program. He has said that he will honor Peru's foreign debt
obligations and implement adjustment measures, but without straining
further Peru's domestic economic and political situation. Interest
arrears to foreign commercial banks have exceeded 180 days for several
months, although the current government has been making partial interest
payments each month since the beginning of this year and has been
implementing some fiscal adjustment measures. The new administration
has not yet made clear whether it intends to pay such arrears (totalling
about $325 million) through use of its foreign exchange reserves or to
implement quickly further reductions in the budget deficit after it
takes office on July 28.
On May 20, the Philippines and its creditor banks signed agreements
providing for a new $925 million medium-term loan and a $3 billion

IV-27
revolving trade credit facility. Banks are also expected to agree to
reschedule approximately $5.8 billion in Philippine debt falling due
between October 1983 and December 1986. The IMF Executive Board
approved on May 30 a modification of the December 1984 stand-by program,
and the Philippines appears to be complying with the revised performance
criteria. This will permit the Philippines to draw SDR 106 million on
the IMF in early July and also to receive the first disbursement of $400
million from the $925 million new money facility. During the first
quarter of 1985 the current account deficit narrowed to $65 million from
$521 million in the same quarter a year earlier.
