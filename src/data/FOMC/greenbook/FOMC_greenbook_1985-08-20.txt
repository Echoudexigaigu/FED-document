The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity appears to have been growing recently at a moderate
pace. Payroll employment and industrial production rose further in July,
while household and business spending continued to expand, albeit less
rapidly than earlier in the year. Meanwhile, price inflation has been
holding steady, and wage increases have remained moderate.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Preliminary indications suggest that industrial production increased
0.2 per cent in July, about the pace of the past few months. Output of
consumer goods increased 0.3 percent in July reflecting gains in the production
of autos and home goods. Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 8.3
million units--up from a rate of 8.0 million units in June. Production of
supplies for construction also increased in July as did output of materials.
However, production of equipment fell, with output reductions in both the
defense and nondefense components. Capacity utilization was essentially
unchanged in June and July, following a pattern of small declines during
the preceding ten months.
Employment and Unemployment
Employment continued to expand in recent months, but job gains have
remained uneven across industries. Nonfarm payroll employment rose 240,000
in July, close to the average monthly increase during the first half of
this year. Three-fourths of the July advance was in private service-producing
industries, with continued large increases reported in the trade sector,
particularly at eating and drinking establishments. In contrast, gains in

services industry were somewhat smaller than the average monthly increase
over the past year, reflecting in part slower job growth in business services.
In the goods-producing sector, the number of construction jobs rose
23,000 in July, reversing a similar decline in June. Since the start of the
year, hiring at construction sites has increased about 200,000, associated
with a higher level of residential building activity as well as strength in
commercial and highway construction. In contrast, manufacturing employment
edged down in July--although by less than in recent months--bringing the
cumulative loss in factory jobs since January to more than 200,000. Although
weakness has been pervasive throughout the manufacturing sector this year,
job cutbacks have been particularly evident in the metals and machinery
industries.
As measured by the household survey, employment and the labor force
have been quite volatile in recent months, probably reflecting seasonal
adjustment problems connected with the summer flow of workers into the
labor market. In July, large increases in both employment and labor force
participation left the civilian unemployment rate unchanged, remaining at
7.3 percent for the sixth consecutive month.
Personal Income and Consumption
Growth in personal income continued to decelerate in the second quarter.
Abstracting from movements associated with the delayed payment of tax
refunds, real disposable income is estimated to have risen at less than a 1
percent annual rate after registering a 2-1/2 percent increase in the first
quarter. Limited advances in interest income, sluggish growth in manufacturing
payrolls, and a decline in farm income have all contributed to the reduced
pace of income growth.

There are also indications of a slowdown in consumer expenditures from
their earlier, unsustainable pace. Auto sales, which had been well maintained
into the second quarter, dropped back substantially in June and edged down
further in July to an annual rate of 10.4 million units. The recent drop
has been in sales of domestic units and apparently reflects both the phasing
out of interest-assisted sales promotions, as well as competition from
foreign cars. Sales of foreign models were at a record 2.9 million unit
rate in July; since May, the increased supply of Japanese cars has significantly
cut into the domestic small car market. Retail sales for goods other than
autos, gasoline, and nonconsumption items increased 0.5 percent in July;
however, the June change was revised down, and as a result, July sales were
no higher than the second-quarter average.
So far in 1985, consumption growth has outpaced income gains, dropping
the saving rate to an average of slightly less than 5 percent over the
first half of the year, well below the 6.5 percent average of the past
decade. Despite the slowing in income growth, consumer surveys in July
continue to indicate favorable spending attitudes, in large part owing to
lower interest rates and the availability of price discounts. Measures of
buying plans for automobiles and houses in the Michigan and Conference
Board surveys remained at high levels in July, but there was somewhat less
enthusiasm for the purchase of major appliances.
Business Fixed Investment
Business spending for equipment has picked up a bit, but the recent
data point to some moderation in the rate of growth in outlays for struc-
tures. For equipment, shipments of nondefense capital goods rose 3.2

percent in June and 2.8 percent for the second quarter as a whole. The
June gains were concentrated in aircraft and parts, communications
equipment and electrical machinery. In real terms, equipment outlays
are estimated to have advanced at about an 11-1/2 percent annual rate,
after declining in the first quarter.
For structures the value of nonresidential construction put in place
fell 1.5 percent in June, and the previously-reported advance of 0.9 percent
in May was revised to a 1.2 percent decline. Growth in outlays for the
second quarter as a whole still posted a sizable 2.9 percent increase on
the strength of a robust advance in April; however, all of the major components
of nonresidential construction have been flat or registered declines since
April.
Indicators of future business investment suggest that spending increases
will be relatively restrained in coming months. Although new orders for
nondefense capital goods jumped 10.6 percent in June, they were down slightly
for the second quarter as a whole. Meanwhile, growth in new commitments
for commercial and industrial construction has slowed in recent months as
office vacancy rates have continued to rise and industrial capacity utilization
has remained below its longer-run average.
Business Inventories
The pattern of investment in business inventories has been volatile
from month to month; but, on the whole, the rate of accumulation has been
quite moderate. For the second quarter, stocks at all manufacturing
and trade establishments rose at an annual rate of only $5.3 billion in
book value terms, compared with a $21.3 billion rise in the first quarter

of this year. Manufacturers, in particular, have continued to maintain a
conservative inventory stance in the face of sluggish sales and stiff
competition from imports. A moderate increase in the book value of
factory stocks in June largely offset declines in the preceding two months,
and with shipments relatively flat over the first half of the year, the
overall inventories-shipments ratio has remained fairly stable.
In the trade sector, wholesale inventories rose sharply in June after
remaining virtually unchanged in April and May, while retail stocks
fell at a nearly $7 billion annual rate. For the second quarter, wholesalers'
inventories expanded at an annual rate a $7.8 billion rate-similar to the
increase in the preceding two quarters. However, because of a sharp decline
in sales, wholesalers' inventory-sales ratio rose significantly in June,
and stocks at certain outlets such as machinery and electrical goods dealers
may have become somewhat higher than desired. In the retail sector, a
sizable drop in inventories held by nonauto merchandisers was only partially
offset by a rise in the book value of stocks held by auto dealers.
Data for July indicate that stocks of automobiles rose further as auto
production has remained firm despite weaker sales. However, if the
current strike by auto-hauling teamsters is not settled soon, dealer stocks
will be depleted while auto makers may have to cut production to prevent
excessive build-up of inventories at factories and distribution points.
Housing
Housing activity, while relatively vigorous, has not yet shown much
response to the general reduction in mortgage interest rates that occurred
in the spring and early summer. Sales of new homes in May and June were

II-12
about the same as the first-quarter average, and with ample iventories of
unsold units, builders have been cautious about expanding activity further.
Consequently, single-family housing starts edged down in June for the third
consecutive month. However, other indicators suggest that construction may
pick up in the near term: building permit issuance has been relatively
strong, consumer attitudes toward home buying have been quite positive, and
informal trade reports indicate sales levels near the cyclical peak of
early 1984.
Construction of rental apartments, which account for approximately
70 percent of all multifamily starts, was strong on balance during the
first six months of the year. Although the average vacancy rate for
all multifamily rental housing continues to rise and in the second quarter
reached a 10-year high of 7.7 percent, rent concessions on new buildings
may have prevented the absorption rate for newly constructed apartments
from weakening noticeably in recent quarters.
The regional pattern of housing activity has shifted significantly
since late 1983. Activity in the South has slackened, especially for
multifamily construction, as overbuilding has been reported in a number of
key markets (chart). Starts in the Northeast, on the other hand, are
higher than at any time since 1973, house prices in this region are rising
at rates well above the national average.
Federal Sector
After declining in the first quarter, the federal deficit increased
in the second quarter to $216 billion at an annual rate (national income
account basis). The quarterly swings in the deficit this year mostly
reflect delays in the processing of refund payments; after adjustment for

this factor, the deficit was around $190 billion (annual rate) in each of
the past two quarters.
Constant-dollar defense spending increased at around a 9-1/2 percent
annual rate in the second quarter after remaining about unchanged in the
first quarter. Defense spending continues to be very volatile because of
the lumpy nature of many large procurement programs. Meanwhile, real
nondefense expenditures fell in the second quarter, although notable
increases were posted for highway construction grants and farm subsidy
payments.
The Congress passed the first budget resolution for FY1986 on August 1.
The resolution which is summarized in the following table, calls for changes
in taxes and mandatory spending programs and sets targets for discretionary
programs that would cut $277 billion from the congressional baseline over
the next three years. Revenues would be increased by extending mandatory
medicare and social security taxes to state and local govenrment workers.
Defense spending would be cut by freezing the level of real budget authority
in 1986 and limiting the real growth rate to 3 percent in the out-years.
The nondefense spending cuts would be spread over a broad range of programs
(3-year savings are shown in parentheses) including medicare ($11 billion),
housing subsidies ($4 billion), Strategic Petroleum Reserve acquisitions
($4 billion), rural housing credit ($6 billion), agriculture ($12 billion)
and federal worker civilian pay ($11 billion).
State and Local Sector
Activity in the state and local sector was strong in the second
quarter as real outlays for goods and services grew at a 5 percent annual
rate, after considerable weakness over the preceding half year. The rise

1/ The baseline used by the Senate is shown. The House baseline deficit
is larger by $2 billion in 1986 and by lesser amounts in 1987 and
1988 because some impacts of FY1985 supplemental appropriations were
included in House baseline spending estimates.
2/ Both the administration and the Congress have presented their budget
plans on a total budget basis, which includes the outlays of off-budget
entities such as the Federal Financing Bank, in this year's budget

in the second quarter reflects a 35 percent (annual rate) increase in real
outlays for construction. Although construction activity accounts for only
about 10 percent of state and local government outlays, recent changes in
this area have been large enough to influence the movement of total spending.
The fiscal position of state and local governments continues to be
strong, although the aggregate operating and capital accounts surplus
apparently declined somewhat in the second quarter. However, states appear
to be adopting cautious fiscal policies because of concerns about possible
cuts in federal aid and elimination of deductions for state and local taxes
on federal income tax returns. Many states have acted on legislation to
increase state cigarette taxes, and several states have raised fuel taxes
this year.
Exports and Imports
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit grew about 10 percent in June,
and for the second-quarter as a whole the deficit averaged $134 billion at
an annual rate, the largest quarterly deficit on record. The increased
second-quarter deficit resulted both from a small rise in imports and a
drop in exports. The decline in exports was widespread across commodity
categories while the small rise in imports occurred as increases in oil and
automotive product imports offset declines in the other major commodity
categories. The high level of imports continues to reflect the lagged
effects of the appreciating dollar and the strength of U.S. demand for
foreign goods.
Prices of non-oil imports declined slightly in the second quarter
despite the falling exchange value of the dollar; since the third quarter
of 1984, non-oil import prices have declined 3 percent. The price of imported

II-18
oil firmed a bit early in the second quarter, but those increases were partly
reversed in June. Further discussion of international developments is
included in section IV.
Prices
Recent price reports indicate that inflation has continued at a
moderate pace. Producer prices of finished goods rose 0.3 percent in July,
after a downward-revised 0.2 percent decline in June,1 while the consumer
price index for all urban consumers rose 0.2 percent in June for the
second consecutive month.
In the food sector, a surge in the prices of fresh vegetables
boosted the July PPI for finished foods 1.3 percent; the index had
declined in each of the four preceding months. Excluding the spurt
in vegetable prices, downward price pressure continues to be fairly
widespread in the food sector, owing to abundant meat supplies, favorable
crop prospects, and declining exports. The prices of crude foods fell in
July for the seventh month in a row, and recent commodity prices point
to a further drop in August. With respect to energy prices, the PPI energy
indexes declined for the second consecutive month in July and CPI energy
price advances slowed to a moderate 0.2 to 0.3 percent monthly pace in May
and June. Private survey data for July suggest some decline on a seasonally
adjusted basis in retail gasoline prices, and weakness in world crude oil
1. Starting with June, the PPI indexes for finished goods, energy items,
and other relevant groupings reflect the introduction of new, unlagged
series for refined petroleum products derived from the PPI industry-based
revision program. Before June, the indexes for refined petroleum products
are still based on average revenue data, which were reported with a one-month
lag. The June data for these indexes incorporate price changes for the
two-month period from April to June.

markets also suggests a favorable outlook for energy prices in the near
term.
Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in
June for the third successive month. The commodity component fell 0.2
percent in both May and June, while service prices, by contrast, accelerated
somewhat in the second quarter. Over the first half of this year, however,
the pace of nonenergy service prices has been about the same as in 1984;
the prices of nonfood nonenergy commodities have risen a little less
rapidly than last year. At the producer level, capital equipment prices
remained unchanged in July, while prices of intermediate materials, exclud-
ing food and energy, fell 0.1 percent.
Wage and Labor Costs
Wage inflation in the private nonfarm economy appears to have leveled
off over the past year. The employment cost index (ECI) for wages and
salaries rose 4-1/2 percent at an annual rate (not seasonally adjusted) in
the first half of 1985, little changed from the 4-1/4 percent rate for
1984. Wage increases have continued to be quite small in the unionized
sector, averaging about 3-1/2 percent so far in 1985. The smallest contract
settlements this year have occurred in manufacturing and construction,
reflecting competitive pressures from foreign and domestic nonunion firms.
Moderate wage and salary increases in 1985 have been accompanied by
considerably slower rates of increase in employee benefit costs. The
employment cost index for total compensation rose only 4.1 percent in the
first half of 1985. Since the beginning of the year, moderate benefit
increases have held compensation growth below wage inflation, reversing the

pattern that had existed since the BLS began collecting benefit data for the
ECI in 1981. The smaller increases in fringe benefits are reported to be
largely the result of efforts by employers to negotiate lower-cost health
insurance plans. In addition, the recent appreciation of the assets of
pension funds as well as smaller projected future benefits associated with
lower inflation may be resulting in smaller employer contributions.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose 1/2 percent at an
annual rate in the second quarter, following a decline of 3.1 percent in
the first quarter. With productivity growth essentially flat over the past
year, the growth in unit labor costs, at 4-1/2 percent, has fully reflected
the increases in hourly compensation.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Market rates of interest have risen somewhat--generally by 1/4 to
3/8 of a percentage point--since the July FOMC meeting. Traders found
little in the Board's midyear monetary policy report or in Chairman Volcker's
remarks to support a bullish case for fixed-income securities, and the
slightly firmer tone of the federal funds market in recent weeks reinforced
their caution. Disappointment regarding the Congressional budget compromise
and some economic indicators that were stronger than anticipated also
weighed on market sentiment.
Although market participants evidently have not attached primary
importance to the money numbers, the persistence of M1 growth above the
Committee's long-run target range has been a negative psychological factor.
M1 growth has slowed markedly from the May-June pace but was still in the
area of 9 percent in July. M2 also posted an increase of that magnitude
last month, with large inflows to money market deposit and savings accounts
offsetting weakness in small time accounts and other components. M3, on
the other hand, grew at only a 4 percent rate, as depository institutions
ran off managed liabilities and institutional money funds shrank. Asset
expansion at S&Ls may have continued weak, while bank funding needs were
satisfied in part through a sizable gain in government deposits.
Aggregate borrowing is estimated to have strengthened a bit in July,
mostly as a result of heavy public sector debt issuance. Business credit
demands apparently diminished; corporate borrowing remained focused on the

moderation in the growth of consumer credit recently. Mortgage debt
expansion probably has been well maintained, with a strong flow of credit

through the mortgage-backed securities market. State and local government
bond issuance has been kept at high levels in part by advance refundings,
and the federal government has continued to borrow heavily to finance its
deficit.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
July's 9 percent growth rate, coming on the heels of almost 20 percent
growth (annual rate) in June, placed M1 a bit above the parallel band
associated with the 3 to 8 percent target range for the second half of
the year. It also suggests that there will be another sizable decline in
M1 velocity in the current quarter--possibly again in excess of what might
be anticipated on the basis of most models of money demand.
The deceleration of M1 in July was attributable to a moderation in
the expansion of currency holdings and a sharp reduction in the growth of
demand deposits, which changed little after expanding at an average rate
of nearly 20 percent during May and June. Other checkable deposits,
meanwhile, continued to rise rapidly as spreads between market interest
rates and rates on NOW accounts remained relatively narrow.
M2 growth was reduced in July by both the slowdown in M1 and a
slackening in the expansion of its nontransactions components. The July
increase in M2, nonetheless, left this aggregate around the 9 percent upper
bound of its 1985 target range. The deceleration in the non-M1 portion of
M2 was widespread across subcomponents. Small time deposits, which had
grown slowly in June, contracted in July, as the spread between yields on
market instruments and rates on these deposits widened.
At the same time, a flattening in the term structure of retail
deposit rates has encouraged savers to direct their funds to other M2

components such as savings deposits and MMDAs. Savings deposits grew at
a 16 percent rate in July--the strongest performance in almost three years-
while MMDAs increased at a 22 percent pace. Assets of M2-type money market
mutual funds were about unchanged in July, as their returns adjusted to
earlier declines in market interest rates, and overnight RPs and Eurodollar
deposits ran off along with other wholesale liabilities.
The slow growth of M3 in July left this aggregate at about the
midpoint of its 6 to 9-1/2 percent target range for the year. An $8 bil-
lion inflow of U.S. government deposits permitted commercial banks to
reduce their managed liabilities while still expanding their assets at a
brisk rate. The decline in bank CDs and other domestic liabilities might
have been even sharper had banks not advanced $3 billion to their foreign
branches to pay down relatively costly Eurodollar deposits. Asset growth
at thrift institutions probably continued moderate; thrifts allowed large
time deposits to run off in July and only partially substituted FHLB
advances for them. Institution-only money funds, which accounted for
much of the strength in M3 during May and June, contracted sharply in July
when their yields fell relative to market interest rates.
Bank credit expanded at more than a 9-1/2 percent annual rate in
July, approximately the average pace over the first half of the year.
The composition of asset growth shifted, however, as banks acquired a
sizable volume of Treasury securities for their investment accounts and
experienced some reduction in the growth of their loans. The main factor
in the slowing of loan growth was the leveling off of security loans after
a period of sharp expansion. Business loans at domestic banking offices,
which had been sluggish throughout the second quarter, remained so in July.

Real estate and consumer lending continued in July near the June pace,
which for consumer lending was appreciably slower than for the earlier part
of the year.
Business Finance
Overall demands for shorter-term business credit appear to have
weakened further in July. At banks, the sum of domestic office plus
foreign branch loans to businesses was flat. Outstanding commercial paper
of nonfinancial corporations meanwhile rose only marginally. Net paydowns
of merger-related paper contributed to the substantial slowing of growth
in this latter source of financing over the past two months, but the more
general weakness in short-term credit apparently reflected limited inventory
financing requirements and a preference for longer-maturity debt during a
period of comparatively low bond rates.
Corporate bond issuance remained quite large in July, although well
below June's record-setting volume (which was boosted by two huge bond
issues to retire equity). Some companies used bond proceeds to pay down
short-term debt, but a substantial amount continued to be devoted to the
purchase of equity shares in mergers or other financial restructurings.
Thus, while a large volume of new equity issues came to market, net funds
raised in equity markets continued to be deeply negative.
Industrial firms have been active issuers of bonds in the last two
months. Offerings by financial firms in July fell below their second-
quarter level as auto finance companies sharply reduced their presence
in the long-term debt markets. Several highly rated companies marketed
large issues, and a substantial share of the total volume in July was rated
Aa and Aaa. Corporate borrowing in the U.S. tax-exempt market apparently
continued to be light.

III-8
The demand for Eurodollar issues has softened with the recent
weakening of the dollar on exchange markets, but U.S. corporations have
continued to market issues abroad. Some of this borrowing has been
accomplished through issuance of non-U.S. dollar bonds, including those
denominated in Australian and New Zealand currencies, with arrangements to
swap the proceeds into dollars. (See Part IV for additional information
on innovations in off-shore finance.)
Several broad stock price indexes touched record highs in mid-July.
Share prices have fallen since then, however, as interest rates have edged
up and as second-quarter reports show some weakening in corporate profits.
The weakness in earnings appears to have been most pronounced among indus-
trial firms. Increased interest expenses damped profits of some companies
carrying heavy debt burdens acquired in recent merger-related or restruc-
turing activities, while sluggish demand and import competition continued
to place pressure on profit margins in a number of sectors. Despite the
evident softening in profits, corporate cash flow probably rose in the
aggregate, and the financing gap of nonfinancial corporations in the
second quarter likely remained near its first-quarter level. Lower interest
rates bolstered earnings of financial firms, including many commercial banks
and thrifts, and profits of home builders apparently improved.
U.S Government Securities Markets
The staff is projecting a combined (on- and off-budget) deficit of
$49 billion in the third quarter. To meet its financing requirements,
the Treasury is expected to borrow $54 billion from the public, including
$47-1/2 billion in the form of marketable securities. The bulk of these mar-
ketable obligations will be coupon issues; bill financing is expected to

III-9
account for only $6 billion. Financing patterns could be altered,
however, if difficulties are encountered in achieving an increase in the
federal debt ceiling by late September, when the current ceiling would
become binding.
Recently, the Treasury has sold unusually large amounts of
nonmarketable securities. Nonmarketable borrowings totaled $6-3/4 billion
last quarter, and they may approach that sum in the current three months;
this compares with a quarterly average of $2-1/2 billion in calendar 1984.
The principal factor in this borrowing is the issuance of securities to
state and local governments, largely in connection with advance refunding
operations.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies is expected to
slow in the third quarter to $6-1/4 billion--still a substantial figure.
The Federal Home Loan Bank System will maintain a strong borrowing pace
to fund a sizable volume of advances to S&Ls, and Fannie Mae likely will
continue to finance significant mortgage acquisitions.
Net borrowing by the Farm Credit Banks generally has been marginally
negative for the last three years, but paydowns have quickened this year as
heavy debt burdens and other problems of farmers have curtailed loan demand
in the agricultural sector. So far in 1985, outstanding debt of the Farm
Credit Banks has declined about $4 billion.
Investor concern about the creditworthiness of the Farm Credit Banks
intensified during late July in the wake of press reports about studies to
reorganize the system. The market reacted strongly, and interest rate
spreads between Farm Credit securities and Treasury securities widened
considerably. A Farm Credit System 5-year bond traded between 10 and

Tax-exempt Securities Markets
Issuance of long-term tax-exempt bonds remained strong in July:
offerings totaled $12 billion, near the monthly average for the second
quarter. In the short-term market, volume was buoyed by a $2.3 billion
offering of revenue anticipation notes by the State of California.
Refunding bonds constituted about one-third of the dollar volume of
long-term offerings in July. During the first seven months of the year,
refunding issues reached almost $20 billion, exceeding by a wide margin
the previous high volume for a full year. Tax reform proposals that
would prohibit advance refunding bonds after 1985 may have bolstered their
volume this year, but most market sources indicate that the lower level of
interest rates prevailing in recent months has been the primary influence.
Offerings of tax-exempt securities for new capital also have been large;
July's volume totaled $8.3 billion, a little above the average in the pre-
vious three months and for 1984 as a whole. Issuance of mortgage revenue
bonds for single-family housing picked up a bit in July from its reduced
pace in May and June; throughout 1985, offerings of tax-exempt bonds for
multifamily housing construction have been above the levels of recent years.
Commercial banks have become more active purchasers of tax-exempt
securities, reportedly the result of their high relative yields and of
improved profits at banks. In addition, a provision in the tax reform
package that would eliminate the remaining tax deductibility of interest
expenses for carrying tax-exempt bonds bought after this year has encouraged

III-12
purchases by commercial banks. Acquisitions by property and casualty
insurance companies also appear to have increased a bit. Nonetheless, the
property/casualty industry continues to record large underwriting losses,
despite recent sharp increases in commercial insurance rates, and their
purchases of municipals are small by historical standards.

Mortgage Market
Interest rates on most home mortgages have backed up a bit since
the last FOMC meeting, but remain near their lowest levels of the decade.
Contract rates on commitments for conventional fixed-rate mortgage loans
at S&Ls averaged 12.23 percent last week, up 29 basis points from their
July low. With yields on adjustable-rate loans little changed in the
interim, ARMs have continued to provide a first-year rate advantage of
well over 200 basis points relative to new commitments on fixed-rate loans.
In early July, the proportion of conventional loans closed with adjustable-
rate features at major types of originators edged down to 55 percent,
slightly above most earlier months of this year but still less than the

III-13
two-thirds proportion recorded in mid-1984 when initial rate spreads were
wider and interest rate levels were higher.
Growth of residential mortgage debt was strong in the second quarter--
perhaps just under 10 percent at an annual rate. Expanding demands for
mortgage credit during the spring and early summer largely have been met
through mortgage pools. All three federally related housing credit agencies
have been active issuers or guarantors of pass-through securities, and new
issues of such securities in the second quarter, bolstered by heavy swaps,
were close to a record. Issuance of pass-through securities continued to
be strong in July.
Diversified investors have been the key suppliers of funds to the
residential mortgage market this year. By contrast, thrift institutions
have slowed markedly their net takings of both loans and mortgage-backed
securities. In June, FSLIC-insured institutions ran off $5 billion of
mortgage-backed securities which, together with their slower net acquisi-
tion of loans, led to a record decline of $2.7 billion in their mortgage
assets. Total asset growth has been sluggish at thrifts since the beginning
of the year, partly the result of new net worth requirements imposed by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board in January, but the prevailing lower market
interest rates also have made it possible for some institutions to realize
capital gains by selling mortgage assets.
The Federal National Mortgage Association recently announced tighter
underwriting and mortgage eligibility standards for certain conventional
home loans that it purchases, effective October 15 of this year. Imple-
mented against a backdrop of high delinquency and foreclosure rates, this
change extends a trend toward stricter requirements by private mortgage

insurers and other market participants and is intended to reduce the credit
risk on mortgages. Market participants interpret this latest action by FNMA
as an attempt to address particularly risky practices and does not change
standards, such as maximum carrying cost burdens relative to income, on
most loans that FNMA buys.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit growth slowed in June to a 16-1/2 percent
annual rate, the lowest since late 1984, and well below the average of 21
percent during the preceding three months. The reduction in growth occurred
entirely in revolving credit--which appears to have expanded by less than
one percent in June compared with gains of 25 to 30 percent in earlier
months this year. Some banks reported a heavy volume of repayments by
credit card users that may have stemmed from receipt of delayed tax refunds.
Rapid expansion of consumer borrowing during the second quarter
lifted the ratio of consumer installment debt to disposable personal income
to a new high. Accompanying debt repayment burdens have been restrained
by two factors: average maturities of new auto loans have lengthened
considerably since the previous peak in the ratio in 1979, and revolving
credit, which allows borrowers flexibility in matching payments with
variations in income, has become relatively more important in consumer
installment debt.
Aggregate data suggest that debt repayment problems of the household
sector may not have worsened much further in the second quarter following
broad increases in delinquency rates in the first quarter. Automobile
finance companies experienced only a slight rise in delinquencies, and
these rates were well below historical averages. While measures of

mortgage delinquencies on all types of properties at savings and loan
associations reached new record levels during the second quarter, an
informal staff inquiry about delinquencies on second mortgages at large
finance companies revealed flat or declining delinquency rates during the

expansion of second-mortgage credit or to tighten its credit standards.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
On balance since the last FOMC meeting, the weighted-average value
of the dollar, shown in Chart 1, has depreciated 4 percent, and is
currently 16 percent below its late-February peak. The dollar declined
sharply in the early part of the intermeeting period, and since that time
has not experienced much net change in value.
The dollar's decline in early July appeared to be motivated in part
by increasing market concern about the pace of monetary growth in the
United States and some indications of weaker-than-anticipated U.S.
economic activity. These concerns seem to have been attenuated in more
recent weeks as new economic data provided some encouraging, although
still mixed, signals concerning economic activity in the United States.
Moreover, dollar interest rates have risen on balance in the weeks since
Chairman Volcker's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, and concern about rapid
money growth has appeared to lessen. These developments seem to have
contributed to the relative stability of the dollar in recent weeks.
Chart 2 displays an average of short-term foreign interest rates
and a comparable short-term dollar rate. The differential between these
two series has tended to narrow in the last five weeks as most foreign
rates have continued to ease while dollar rates have risen on balance. A
similar pattern is evident in the behavior of domestic and foreign
long-term rates. As can be seen in the chart, the interest advantage of
assets denominated in foreign currencies generally increased during the
steep fall of the dollar from its late-February peak, while the recent

narrowing of the interest differential has accompanied a period of
relative stability of the dollar.
Foreign authorities have continued to respond cautiously to the
dollar's decline. Official rate reductions were announced by the United
Kingdom, France, and Sweden when the dollar was depreciating rapidly
shortly after the last FOMC meeting. Subsequently, only the Bank of
England has announced a further reduction in its money market dealing
rates, to around 11-1/2 percent, and this move was taken during a period
of particular strength of sterling. German short-term market rates have
fallen about 60 basis points since the last FOMC meeting, but no official
rate reductions have been announced to date.
An EMS realignment, entailing an effective 7.8 percent reduction of
the lira relative to all other EMS currencies, was announced on Saturday,
July 20. On the preceding Thursday, in the context of discussions of
medium-term economic objectives, the Italian government had apparently
decided to seek a devaluation of the lira within the EMS during the
weekend of July 20. On Friday, the lira suddenly depreciated 18 percent
against the dollar -- from 1860 to 2200 lira per dollar-- just prior to
the Milan fixing. Several transactions were conducted at this rate.
In the three weeks since the EMS realignment, the lira has been
relatively stable within its new EMS intervention limits, but the Belgian
franc and French franc have experienced intermittent bouts of intense

IV-4
downward pressure. Pressure on the Belgian and French currencies
appeared to derive from a market perception that considerations of
relative competitiveness provided scope for devaluations of these
currencies within the EMS. Since the previous EMS realignment in March
1983, the deterioration in the French and Belgian competitive positions
(as measured by real exchange rate changes) was not substantially less
than that of Italy. Thus, when the EMS realignment of July 20 did not
incorporate devaluations of the French and Belgian currencies along with
the devaluation of the lira, speculation of further EMS adjustments
emerged.
the Belgian franc is
experiencing mild downward pressure.
On July 25, the Mexican authorities announced a 16.7 percent
devaluation of the controlled peso exchange rate, which is used for
around 80 percent of Mexico's international transactions, as part of a
package of adjustment measures. The devaluation of the controlled peso
rate followed by two weeks the abolition of the official "free" rate that
applied to the balance of the country's international transactions.

IV-5
These transactions were moved to the so-called "super-free" rate, in
effect resulting in a 27.2 percent devaluation. The controlled exchange
rate continued to be depreciated by 21 centavos per day after July 25,
but, effective August 5, began to be set daily on a discretionary basis.
During the first week of the new exchange rate regime, the peso
depreciated at an average rate of 40 centavos per day. The new rate of
crawl takes account of exchange market pressures, the level of Mexico's
international reserves, and internal and external price developments.
The July 25 measures were favorably received and the exchange rate in
U.S. markets, which had been quoted at 370 pesos per dollar the day prior
to the announcement of the package, appreciated to 332 pesos by August 13.

IV-6
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Exchange rate and interest rate developments in the second quarter
were reflected in the changing character of financial flows and
financial instruments that affected the sources of financing for the
current account deficit.
Foreign official reserve assets held in the United States rose by
$7.7 billion in the second quarter (Summary Table, line 4), the largest
increase since the sustained period of dollar depreciation in 1978.
Foreign G-10 countries' net purchases of $6.0 billion replenished
dollar reserves
.Official foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities totalled $8.5 billion in the second quarter.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities rose by
$5.3 billion in the quarter and by $2.9 billion in June (Summary table,
line 3). The June increase was primarily due to a $2.5 billion net
purchase by Japanese residents which included more than half of the $1
billion foreign targeted Treasury issue that was issued in May but was
not recorded as a capital inflow until June. The Japanese hoped, it
appears, that a strong showing at the targeted Treasury auction would
both tend to dampen protectionist sentiment in the United States and
advance the fortunes of Japanese brokerage houses in the Eurobond
market. In addition, the Treasury auction of domestic and targeted
securities coincided with a run-up in U.S. domestic interest rates
making Treasury securities relatively attractive investments.

IV-7
The rate of foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate securities
(Summary table, lines 2a and 2b) slowed somewhat in the second quarter
as short-term interest rates prevailing in some non-dollar denominated
foreign markets exceeded U.S. short-term rates. In addition, the
perception of increased volatility in the foreign currency return on
dollar denominated investments reduced the attractiveness to foreigners
of purchasing dollar-denominated corporate securities. In response,
U.S. corporations increased the proportion of their newly issued
Eurobonds that were denominated in foreign currency. This phenomenon
was particularly pronounced in July, when the share of Eurobonds issued
by U.S. corporations denominated in foreign currencies rose to 36
percent from an average of about 16 percent over the previous six
months. In the Euromarkets as a whole in July, fully 50 percent of new
issues were foreign currency denominated, whereas the average for the
previous 6 months was about 30 percent.
Declines in long-term interest rates in the United States and some
flattening of the yield curve during the second quarter encouraged
issuers to lock in fixed rates. In the second quarter, 77 percent of
Eurobonds issued by U.S. corporations were fixed-rate bonds, up from 68
percent in the first quarter. In July, 95 percent were fixed rate.
Another reason for this apparent shift was the reduction in U.S. bank
or bank holding company issuance of Mandatory Convertible Securities
(MCS), a type of floating rate note (FRN). About 70 percent of all
U.S. corporate FRNs issued in the first quarter were MCSs, while in the

IV-8
second quarter only 26 percent of FRNs were MCSs. More than one-half
of the largest banks have reached the limit on the share of MCSs that
can be applied to capital.
Continued uncertainty about the direction and rate of change of
currency and interest rate movements contributed to the emergence of
two instruments in the Eurobond market that had previously appeared
only in thin foreign markets: the capped floating rate note and the
dual currency bond. The capped floating rate note, so called because
of the maximum interest rate payable on the bond, yields an asymmetric
risk opportunity by limiting the upside interest rate risk incurred by
the borrower; the lender gets a somewhat higher spread. Of all FRNs
issued in the second quarter, $2.6 billion (17 percent) were this kind
of note. However, many issuers in fact detached the cap and sold (on
behalf of the lender) what is essentially a long-dated interest rate
put option to third parties who presumably would have received less
favorable terms had they entered the market directly. Moreover,
long-dated interest rate option contracts are not generally available.
The dual currency bond, where the currency of principal repayment
and the currency of interest payments differ, represents an alternative
response to greater market uncertainty about medium-term trends in the
exchange rate. Issues in 1985 through July totalled $3.6 billion.
With this kind of note, the holder is partially hedged against either a
dollar appreciation or depreciation: the purchasing power gain or loss
on one aspect of the bond (say, the principal) partially offsets the
opposite change in the purchasing power of the other part of the bond
(the interest payment stream).

IV-9
In contrast to the securities and official accounts, both of which
yielded net inflows during the second quarter, the banking sector
yielded a net outflow for the quarter of $1.9 billion, spurred by the
relatively large net outflow of $5.4 billion in June (Summary table,
line 1). Similarly, the International Banking Data table (line 3)
reveals interbank outflows in June that continued into July. Some of
the net outflow during the quarter may have been related to weak credit
demands in the United States. However, the interbank outflow
represented by the July figure (which is a monthly average) appears to
be related to end-of-period window dressing since similar movements
occurred over the several days spanning the end of December 1984 and
the beginning of the following January, June and July 1984, and
December 1983 and the following January.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In June, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was larger than that
recorded in May; for the second quarter as a whole it was the largest
quarterly deficit on record. The increase in the deficit in the second
quarter resulted from a substantial drop in exports and a relatively small
increase in imports.
The value of agricultural exports dropped by 15 percent in the second
quarter; much of the decline was in the volume of corn and soybeans. The
decline in nonagricultural exports was also fairly large. Exports of
industrial supplies fell by 7 percent (especially chemicals, fuel oil, coal,
and paper), exports of capital goods dropped by 6 percent (particularly
computers and parts and broadcasting equipment), and exports of consumer

goods fell by 8 percent. By area, declines occurred with both developing
and industrial countries. Only with Canada did U.S. nonagricultural exports
increase; shipments of automotive products, which account for one-third of
U.S. nonagricultural exports to Canada, were unchanged between the first and
second quarters.
The value of oil imports increased substantially in the second quarter
from a relatively low first-quarter level. Nearly all of the rise was in
volume; oil imports in the second quarter averaged 5.4 million barrels per
day (mbd) compared with 4.6 mbd in the first quarter. It appears that most
of the increase went into inventories as inventory accumulation returned to
more normal rates following unusually large drawdowns in the first quarter;
U.S. oil consumption declined somewhat in the second quarter. The average
price of imported oil increased by about 10 cents per barrel in the second
quarter; price increases in April and May were partly reversed in June.

The value of nonoil imports declined somewhat in the second quarter. A
reduction in imports of machinery, industrial supplies, consumer goods and
foods was partly offset by an increase in automotive imports (largely from
Japan). While imports from industrial countries rose somewhat, shipments
from developing countries in Latin America and Asia fell by 8 percent.

IV-14
Foreign Economic Developments. The pace of economic activity in
several major foreign industrial economies appears to have increased in
the second quarter. However, this represents in part a recovery from
unusually low first-quarter levels and does not necessarily signal a
move toward sustained higher rates of real growth in foreign industrial
countries as a group. Japanese industrial production increased sharply
in the second quarter following a decline in the first quarter. A
similar pattern prevailed in Germany, where, as in neighboring European
countries, first-quarter activity was depressed by severe winter
weather. The rapid growth of U.K. industrial production in the second
quarter in large part reflected the increase in coal production
following the ending of the miners' strike in March. Despite
the increased activity in several countries, unemployment rates in
general have held steady at or near record high levels.
Inflation rates in major foreign industrial countries have shown
no discernible trend in recent months. There are indications that the
rise in U.K. inflation earlier in the year will prove temporary, with a
reversal of the previous rise in mortgage rates helping to hold down
increases the U.K. retail price index.
The Japanese trade surplus widened further in the second quarter,
and for the first half of the year was nearly $50 billion (s.a.a.r.).
Germany also registered a record trade surplus in the first half. The
U.K. trade deficit was reduced in the second quarter as fuel oil
imports dropped following the ending of the coal miners' strike. In
Italy, in contrast, the trade deficit widened in the first five months
of the year compared with the same period last year.

IV-18
Individual Country Notes. Recent data on industrial production
in Japan suggest that the economy is expanding, although at a slower
pace than experienced last year. Following a first-quarter decline,
Japanese industrial production grew 12.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
second quarter and was 6.7 percent above its year-earlier level.
Housing starts also showed continued strength, standing about 6 percent
above their year-earlier levels in June.
Price increases have continued to be modest. The Tokyo consumer
price index rose 2.8 percent during the 12 months ending in July, and
wholesale prices declined by 1.2 percent over the same period. Japan's
external surpluses widened further in the second quarter. The
cumulative trade surplus for the first half of the year was just under
$50 billion (s.a.a.r.) and the corresponding cumulative current account
surplus was $43 billion.
On July 26, the Nakasone government approved guidelines for its
fiscal 1986 budget. These guidelines suggest continued fiscal
austerity, with the overall increase in covered nominal expenses being
limited to 1.5 percent. Although the Prime Minister called for a study
of possible tax reforms earlier in the week, it is not expected that a
large tax cut will be implemented in 1986.
The final version of the "Action Program" that is intended to
increase the openness of the Japanese economy was announced on July 30.
The program, which will be implemented over a three-year period, will
include a phased reduction in tariffs on a wide variety of manufactured
and agricultural products as well as an easing of some non-tariff
barriers. Additional measures to liberalize Japanese financial markets

IV-19
were also announced as part of the "Action Program," including
timetables for the removal of interest rate restrictions on large time
deposits and for the issuing of euro-yen floating rate notes by
residents.
Industrial production in Germany rose 2 percent (s.a.) in June,
after a 1 percent increase in May. Despite this recent strength, the
average second-quarter level of industrial production barely surpassed
the level in the fourth quarter of last year, owing to the sharp
decline in the early months of this year associated with
exceptionally severe winter weather. Preliminary GNP estimates confirm
the second-quarter recovery. Early indications are that sources of
strength in recent months have been exports and investment in
equipment, while consumption has remained flat and the construction
sector continues to experience severe problems. The rate of
unemployment, at 9.4 percent (s.a.) in July, remained near its peak of
recent years. Consumer prices fell 0.2 percent (n.s.a.) in July to a
level 2.3 percent above July of last year.
Reflecting the strength of foreign demand, the trade surplus
for the first half of the year, at $10.2 billion (n.s.a.), was the
largest ever. The current account surplus for the first half of the
year was $4.3 billion (n.s.a.) compared with $700 million in the same
period last year.
The federal budget for 1986 was recently approved by the
cabinet. It provides for 2.4 percent nominal growth in expenditures
over budgeted 1985 spending and a federal deficit unchanged from that
expected for this year, about 1.2 percent of nominal GNP.

IV-20
Industrial production in France increased by 1.5 percent (s.a.)
in May, only partially reversing the 2.2 percent decline of the
previous month. The May level of industrial production showed no
change from its year-earlier value. The recorded unemployment rate
was unchanged at 10.6 percent (s.a.) in both May and June, kept down
in part by government training programs for new entrants into the job
market.
Consumer prices increased by 0.4 percent (n.s.a.) in July as
the year-over-year inflation rate eased to 6.1 percent. The
government has revised upward its official inflation forecast for
1985 from 4-1/2 percent to 5 percent.
The trade account was in surplus by $200 million (s.a.) in
June, the first monthly surplus this year. In the first half of
1985, the trade deficit was just under $3 billion (s.a.a.r.), about
the same as in 1984 as a whole.
Industrial production in the United Kingdom grew 8.6 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, in large part the result of the
increase of coal production that followed the March 5 ending of the
coal miners' strike. June industrial production declined by 0.6
percent (s.a.) and was 4.7 percent above its year-earlier level.
Recent data on consumer prices suggest that the sharp
acceleration in inflation that took place in the spring will be
temporary. Although the retail price index was 7 percent above its
year-earlier level in the second quarter, prices advanced only 0.2
percent (n.s.a.) in June. The recent 3/4 percentage point drop in
mortgage rates should lower the price index by about 1/3 percent.

IV-21
The U.K. trade deficit was $1.5 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the second
quarter and the corresponding current account surplus was $6 billion.
Both external balances have improved significantly from the first
quarter, when the ongoing coal miners' strike led to a high level of
fuel oil imports,
The Bank of England lowered its official interest rates
by 1 percentage point in July amid calls by several industry
officials for even larger reductions. Statements by Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson have suggested that the climate for future
interest rate cuts will depend in part on the strength of the pound.
Gross domestic product in Canada increased 0.4 percent (s.a.)
in April, the eighth consecutive monthly increase. On a year-over-
year basis, this measure of production was up 4.5 percent.
Industrial production was unchanged (s.a.) in May and was 3.9 percent
above its year-earlier level. The unemployment rate declined
slightly in July to 10.4 percent (s.a.), moving 0.8 percentage point
below its level in March.
Consumer prices increased by 0.6 percent (n.s.a.) in June,
raising the inflation rate over the past 12 months to 4.1 percent.
Wholesale prices were unchanged (n.s.a.) in June, and their year-
over-year increase was only 2.6 percent.
The trade surplus declined slightly in June to $900 million
(s.a.). Over the first six months of the year, the trade surplus was
$15 billion (s.a.a.r.), about the same as the surplus recorded in the
corresponding period last year.

IV-22
Real GNP in Italy rose 2.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter. Industrial production in the first five months of 1985 was
1.9 percent higher than in the same period in 1984. The official
household surveys held in June and July showed a jump in consumer
confidence. This increase in confidence came in the wake of the
public's rejection of the referendum designed to reinstate 1984's
lost wage indexation points.
In July, the cost of living index was 8.7 percent above its
year-earlier level. During the first six months of 1985, industrial
wages were nearly 11 percent higher than in the first half of 1984.
This rise in real industrial wages occurred despite an unemployment
rate that has remained at historically high levels (10.2 percent).
The trade deficit in May was $700 million (s.a.), and the
cumulative trade deficit in the first five months of 1985 was $14.2
billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with $9.3 billion in the same period in
1984.
In conjunction with the devaluation of the lira announced on
July 20, the government proposed new measures designed to reduce the
budget deficit by raising revenues by an amount equivalent to about 1
percent of GDP.

IV-23
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
On July 25, Mexico took some corrective actions intended to return
the country to the adjustment path from which it had deviated during the
past nine months. The measures included (a) a 16.7 percent devaluation
of the controlled exchange rate, which applies to about 80 percent of
the country's international transactions, (b) the elimination of the
requirement that an import license be obtained on goods which together
account for about 37 percent of Mexico's imports, thereby making more
than 60 percent of Mexico's imports subject to tariffs rather than
quantitative restrictions, and (c) steps to cut public sector spending,
bringing the total of such cuts since the beginning of the year to the
equivalent of 3.9 percent of total budgeted spending or 1.4 percent of
GDP. However, the cuts in public spending announced so far will not
prevent Mexico from exceeding the 1985 public sector deficit target of
4.1 percent of GDP specified under its IMF program approved only two
months ago. Overspending of 3 to 4 percent of GDP is occurring because
of higher-than-expected interest payments on the internal public debt
owing to a sharp rise in interest rates, because of the failure of the
inflation rate to decline as anticipated, and because the budget was
exceeded in the first half of the year prior to the July 7 mid-term
elections. Moreover, revenues are falling short of estimates, partly
because of the lowering of oil export prices and a lower volume of oil
exports.
The Argentine public appears to be accepting the country's new
adjustment program. However, with Congressional elections scheduled for
early November, it may be difficult to achieve the fiscal objective of

IV-24
the program. Congressional delays in enacting the proposed "forced
savings" plan, which is an important element of the fiscal program, are
a complicating factor. In July, wholesale prices were 0.9 percent lower
than in June, but, even with a price freeze, the July cost of living
index was 6.2 percent higher than the June level, largely because of the
effects of some price increases dating back to the days before the
freeze took effect. Since there was no wage increase in July, this
could bring about an increase in labor complaints about the program.
Following the introduction of the adjustment program, the central bank's
reserves are reported to have increased significantly, bringing about a
substantial increase in the liquidity of the financial system. Unregu-
lated interest rates declined in late June and early July to levels
close to those of the regulated rates, and the premium for the dollar in
the free market, which had virtually disappeared when the new adjustment
program was announced, rose steadily to about 20 percent in mid-July.
The central bank has taken steps to absorb excess liquidity. The moves
were followed by only a slight increase in unregulated interest rates
and only a slight decline in the premium for the dollar. Bank lending
in excess of credit ceilings, apparently made possible by non-compliance
with reserve requirements, is reported to have contributed to the excess
liquidity. The new adjustment program was approved by the IMF Executive
Board on August 9.
Brazil is seeking a new IMF stand-by arrangement for 18 months that
might total SDR 1.5 billion. The major sticking point in the negotia-
tions has been the allowable size of the fiscal deficit. Serious
revenue losses occurred because of the implementation of a 3-1/2 month

IV-25
price freeze on state- and federally-run enterprises and utilities. On
July 4, the government announced a set of measures aimed at narrowing
the 1985 operational deficit to about 0.4 percent of GDP. These mea-
sures by themselves are unlikely to provide the basis for an IMF agree-
ment since the Fund staff does not believe they are adequate to achieve
a substantial reduction in Brazil's current inflation rate of over 200
percent. The new government wants to renegotiate some aspects of the
multi-year commercial bank rescheduling agreement drafted by the
previous government, but the banks will not complete the rescheduling
until the IMF and Brazil reach agreement on a new economic program.
Brazil's bank creditors have agreed to a standstill on repayment of 1985
maturities and have extended the life of trade lines, interbank
lines and redeposit facilities through the end of August.
After subsiding during the first quarter of 1985, Brazil's trade
surplus has again strengthened to the $13 billion annual rate that
prevailed during 1984. Industrial production during January-June 1985
was 6.3 percent higher than during the same period last year; the rate
of increase has been slowing since the first quarter. Several important
strikes by steel and auto workers were recently settled, resulting in a
shorter work week (40 hours vs. 48 hours) and in more frequent wage
readjustments for inflation (quarterly vs. semi-annually). Inflation
over the 12 months ending in July was 217 percent, down only slightly
from 224 percent over the twelve months of 1984.
Peru's new government has frozen nearly all prices, reduced domes-
tic interest rates that were already negative in real terms, increased
wages (particularly the minimum wage), and frozen dollar accounts for 90

IV-26
days. A 10.7 percent devaluation was followed by an announcement that
the exchange rate will remain indefinitely at the new rate. The price
of gasoline was raised to the domestic-currency equivalent of $1.25 per
gallon. Peru's new President, Alan Garcia, has said publicly that his
country will pay no more than 10 percent of export receipts in debt
service over the next year, and that priority in future repayments will
be given to those creditors who are granting fresh credits to Peru. The
new administration also requested a postponement of repayments of
medium- and long-term public sector debt to foreign banks that fall due
before January 31, 1986. (Principal payments have been rolled over by
the banks since mid-1984.) Peru's interest arrears to banks were about
$275 million at the end of July and are accumulating at a rate of about
$27 million a month.
Chile's three-year IMF extended arrangement for SDR 70 million was
approved in principle by the IMF on July 15 and took effect August 9
when the critical mass of bank financing had been committed.
On July 26, the IMF Executive Board agreed to monitor the implemen-
tation of an economic program proposed by the Colombian government,
clearing the way for a $1.0 billion commercial bank loan. The financing
is to be used for development projects, and disbursements will be
conditional on satisfactory reports from the IMF. Although other Latin
American countries have negotiated debt-refinancing agreements that
involve IMF surveillance, the Colombian agreement is unique in that it
does not involve rescheduling.
The circulation of the terms sheet for the multi-year rescheduling
agreement to Venezuela's 450 creditor banks was completed on July 9.

IV-27
The final signing of the agreement may begin in early September. Before
this occurs, however, Venezuela must show further progress in the review
for registration of some $12 billion in private sector debt. Over $11
billion of this private sector debt has been reviewed so far.
On July 8, the Philippines obtained the seventh, 90-day extension
of its moratorium on the repayment of principal on non-trade external
debt to commercial banks. The Philippines met its end-May IMF targets
and, on July 30, drew the second tranche of SDR 106 million of the
SDR 615 million stand-by arrangement established last December. This
will allow the Philippines to draw the first $400 million of the $925
million in new money that the commercial banks agreed last May to
provide.
