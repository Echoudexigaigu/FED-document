The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity appears to have expanded moderately in the third
quarter. Auto sales surged in August and September in response to financing
programs aimed at reducing inventories of 1985 models. However, growth
in most other components of aggregate demand has been sluggish in recent
months. Industrial production was up a bit in August, but there were
offseting downward revisions in the production data for the preceding
three months. Virtually all measures of prices and wages show inflation
remaining relatively quiescent.
Motor vehicles
Toward the end of the summer, final sales were boosted by a very
rapid advance in consumer outlays for automobiles. These sales gains,
however, mainly reflected manufacturers' attempts to liquidate inventories
of 1985 models and may not translate into a significantly higher level of
auto production in coming months. Moreover, while strong demand is stimu-
lating production of light trucks, output of heavy-weight trucks appears
likely to decline in response to weak demand.
Autos. In mid-August, U.S. auto manufacturers introduced financing
incentives and rebates on a wide range of 1985 models. In effect, the
concessions amounted to a reduction in finance rates from around 12
percent to about 7-1/2 to 7-3/4 percent; this is roughly equivalent to a
price cut of a bit less than 10 percent. In response to the incentives,
sales of domestic autos shot up to a 12-1/2 million unit annual rate in
late August and were maintained close to that pace through the first 20
days of September. In addition, sales of foreign cars continued at the
II-1

II-2
advanced 2.8 million unit rate that began in May with the loosening of
the import restrictions for Japanese cars.
The financing programs do not include 1986 model cars, and it is
possible that auto manufacturers hoped that an aggressive liquidation of
1985 inventories would help support higher sticker prices on the new
models. Preliminary announcements by domestic producers for 1986 model
cars indicate a 4 to 6 percent markup over 1985 model prices; this is
equivalent to a 3 percent price increase for comparably-equipped 1986
model cars. Consumers therefore will face a sharp increase in the effec-
tive price of cars once the incentive programs end.
A significant proportion of new car sales in the fourth quarter of
each year usually comprises carryovers from the previous model year. The
effect of the incentive programs probably has been to shift much of this
"carryover" demand for 1985 models into the third quarter, and producers
undoubtedly expect a substantial "payback of borrowed demand" after
the incentives end in early October. Fourth-quarter assembly plans have
not been altered to any significant extent since the incentive programs
were announced.
Trucks. Purchases of domestic light trucks including minivans--
vehicles largely used by households--were at a 3.5 million unit rate in
August, down from the record 3.9 million units reported in July. Sales
of foreign trucks, which are virtually all light-duty models, also
dropped from the record July pace. In part, these declines appear to
have resulted from capacity constraints as well as from lingering supply
problems stemming from the Teamsters' strike. Also, financing concessions

for many of the popular minicargo vans were less generous than those for
cars. So far this year, sales of domestic light trucks have averaged
more than 3-1/2 million units at an annual rate--up from 3-1/4 million
units in 1984; sales of foreign models are up about one-fourth from their
1984 pace.
Heavy-weight trucks. The market for heavy-weight trucks used by busi-
nesses continued to weaken in August with sales at an annual rate of only
216,000 units--the lowest rate in two years. Assemblies of diesel units in
August were reported to be down sharply from a year earlier, and officials
at International Harvester and General Motors expect their output to continue
to slip. Because the average transaction price for these vehicles is very
high--around $70,000 for the cab and chassis and another $30,000 for the
basic trailer--these units account for close to half of total expenditures
for trucks but only about 10 percent of unit truck sales.
Industrial production
Industrial production increased 0.3 percent in August. However,
estimates for the preceding three months were revised down, and the
August level of output is slightly lower than that initially reported for
July. For the first eight months of 1985 industrial production has increased
at an annual rate of about 1-3/4 percent.
In August, the production of automotive products rose sharply,
reflecting a spurt in the production of consumer trucks; output of
domestic automobiles was unchanged, at 8.3 million units. There also
were gains in August in the manufacture of home goods, as well as in
the production of defense and space equipment and business equipment.

Output of materials was little changed in August with slightly
higher production of durable and nondurable goods offset by further
reductions in the output of energy materials. The level of materials
output in August was about 1-1/2 percent below the level of a year earlier.
Employment and unemployment
Both the household and payroll surveys reported employment gains
of about 300,000 in August, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to
7 percent after no change over the past six months. Gains in the service
industry led the August job increase, and hiring was brisk in trade, and
in the finance, insurance, and real estate sectors. Employment in manufac-
turing also rose in August, although the July data were revised to show a
sizable decline. The August advance is the first since January, but much
of it occurred in transportation equipment, where the shift during recent
years in the timing of model changeovers may have caused an overstatement
of the seasonally-adjusted gain. Elsewhere, factory employment was
little changed. Manufacturers also increased the factory workweek from
40.3 to 40.5 hours.
Personal income and consumption
Income growth has slowed markedly this year. Nominal personal
income rose only 0.3 percent in August after gains of 0.4 percent in both
June and July and a decline in May. Wages and salaries, have increased,
on average, about 0.4 percent per month since the first quarter--roughly
two-thirds of their growth rate during 1984. Interest income edged
down in August for a fifth month to a level 1.3 percent below the peak
returns received in September 1984. Farm income was lower for a fourth

II-8
consecutive month; so far this year, the level of farm income has been
about one-fourth below the already-depressed 1984 average.
As previously discussed, personal consumption in August was domi-
nated by the enthusiastic response of consumers to interest and price
concessions on domestic autos. There also was some rebound in sales of
general merchandise in August; however, total spending for nondurable
goods was little changed for a second month. Outlays for services
expanded a bit faster than their relatively sluggish July pace.
With spending, particularly for durable goods, far outpacing
income, the saving rate fell again in August to 2.8 percent--the lowest
rate since 1947. However, there is reason for some skepticism about the
very low level of the currently estimated saving rate, as past data
revisions by the Bureau of Economic Analysis have tended to add more to
income than to expenditures.
The consumer surveys of the Conference Board and the Michigan
Research Survey Center (SRC) taken in August continued to drift somewhat
lower relative to their 1983 peaks. Nonetheless, the level of the SRC
index of sentiment is still historically high, and this index has not
sustained such a long period of favorable readings--more than two years---
since the 1960s. In addition, plans to purchase automobiles have remained
historically high, and SRC respondents indicated a continued willingness
to use credit.
Business fixed investment
Spending for business fixed investment, on balance, has decelerated
in recent months. The average level of nondefense capital goods shipments

in July and August was up a bit from the second-quarter average, extending
the pattern of virtually flat shipments of the past half-year. As noted
earlier, sales of heavy-weight trucks have weakened substantially, falling
about 12 percent in both July and August. In addition, imports of capital
goods, which figured importantly in capital spending earlier in the
expansion, have declined since the spring.
Investment in nonresidential structures has been curtailed in the
past few months, with the July level of spending 1-3/4 percent below the
second-quarter average. The value of nonresidential construction put in
place edged up 0.2 percent in July after a 2.3 percent drop in June. All
of the major components of nonresidential construction have been flat or
have posted declines in spending since April.
Indicators of future business investment have been sluggish. New
orders for nondefense capital goods, while up in August, have been
essentially flat for more than a year. Moreover, the Commerce Department
survey of planned capital spending that was taken in July and August
indicated an increase in nominal outlays of 8.3 percent for 1985, about
1 percentage point less than respondents expected in the spring survey.
Inventories
On the whole, businesses appear content with their current inven-
tory levels. Since the beginning of this year, the inventory-sales ratio
for manufacturing and trade has remained quite stable at around 1.55,
based on constant-dollar data; at the end of July, stocks were only
moderately higher than at the end of the first quarter.
At the manufacturing level, inventories have changed little since
last fall. By stage of processing, manufacturers' stocks of raw materials

and supplies have drifted lower, reflecting longer-term adjustment in the
production of basic metals and generally conservative production schedul-
ing in the face of an uncertain sales outlook.
Investment in trade inventories also has been slow in recent months.
Despite the high volume of imports, real wholesale inventories have
expanded at an average annual rate of only $6-1/2 billion this year,
about half the rate of growth during 1984. In the retail sector, apparel
and general merchandise stocks were a bit high relative to sales through
early summer. However, general merchandisers have pared stocks in recent
months, and the sharp gain in sales in August may have pulled supplies
down further.
Housing markets
Sales of new homes were up about 1 percent in July to a level about
5 percent above the average for the first half, and sales of existing homes
recorded a sharp advance in August. In contrast, single-family housing
starts, at a 1.07 million unit rate in August, have been on a plateau dur-
ing the past three months. Starts of multi-family units have continued
to be quite buoyant.
The recent levels of single-family housing starts and, to some
extent, new home sales have been disappointing in view of historical
relationships between mortgage interest rates and housing activity.
While additional response to the lower rates still is expected, that
response may be tempered somewhat by other, nonrate influences--in
particular, higher premiums for private mortgage insurance and tighter
qualification standards for mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios.

Agriculture
High production and weak demand continue to depress commodity
prices and farm income. Owing to favorable weather through late summer,
crops this year are expected to be close to the previous 1981-82 highs.
Output of feed grains may be the largest ever, and production of cotton
and oil crops also is expected to increase this year. Wheat production,
though down a bit this year, is still above consumption, making for fur-
ther growth in the ample stockpile of this grain.
Agricultural exports have continued to decline this year, dropping in
the first half of 1985 to the lowest level of any half-year period since
1977. A further decline was reported in July. This low volume of
exports reflects weak foreign consumption of grain relative to the trend
of the 1960s and 1970s, and higher foreign production of grain. For the
year ahead, the USDA projects that world grain trade will be at the lower
end of the range of recent years, and that the market share of the United
States will be the smallest since the early 1970s.
Farm prices have declined almost without interruption since the
start of the year. The producer price index for crude foods fell 3.8
percent in August, and the index of prices received by farmers dropped
about 3 percent to the lowest level since 1978. The buildup in grain
stocks has pushed cash prices for wheat and corn well below the floors
established by government support programs (some output is not eligible
for support); opportunities for forward pricing are limited by depressed
futures prices. Livestock prices also have plummeted recently, pressured
in part by a large sell-off of cattle herds; in mid-September, the spot

price of choice steers at Omaha (a benchmark indicator of cattle prices)
dipped below $50 for the first time in seven years, before turning up
in late September.
Depressed farm prices have cut farm cash receipts and prompted
further belt tightening among producers. Current operating expenses, in
nominal terms, have been held essentially flat during the 1980s. In
addition, nominal capital spending fell in each of the past five years
and, according to USDA projections, will be down further in 1985. But
even with these adjustments and considerable government aid, net cash
flow to the farm sector this year probably will be no higher than the
depressed 1984 receipts.
Government programs continue to provide a significant portion of
farm income. With agricultural prices well below the "target prices"
that trigger cash subsidies, government payments to farmers this year are
likely to remain in the high range of the past two years. In addition,
cash is flowing to the farm sector from a shift of stocks to the Commodity
Credit Corporation. At mid-year, the volume of commodities owned or
financed by the CCC was about $1 billion above 1984 levels; most observers
expect CCC stockpiling to accelerate in the second half of this year.
Federal sector
For fiscal 1985 as a whole, the unified deficit will total about
$200 billion ($210 billion including off-budget); this is an increase of
$25 billion over the 1984 budget year. Receipts are expected to be nearly
$70 billion higher, largely because of rising nominal incomes, but outlays
are anticipated to increase even more ($95 billion). Spending increases have
been particularly large for agricultural supports, defense, and interest.

II-19
Defense spending, in real terms on an NIPA basis, rose at a 7-1/4
percent annual rate in the second quarter and apparently a bit more
rapidly in the third quarter. Despite smaller increases in defense
appropriations in the last two years, orders for defense goods and other
advance indicators suggest that defense spending will continue to show
growth through the end of the year.
Action on the fiscal 1986 budget is now largely focused on the
appropriation process in Congress. Thus far, nine of the 13 appropria-
tion bills have passed the House, but only two have been passed by the
Senate; none of the bills has been enacted. In addition, legislation
cutting spending and raising revenues as mandated in the Congressional
Budget Resolution must be reported to the budget committees by the end
of this month. Meanwhile, in the Mid-session Review, the administration
accepted the defense compromises of the Congressional Budget Resolution
but restated most of the the Administration's February proposals for
cuts in nondefense programs. This suggests further compromise between
the executive branch and Congress will be necessary.
State and local sector
After picking up in the second quarter, outlays in the state and
local sector continued to advance at a brisk pace in the third quarter.
Employment in July and August, on average, was 135,000 above the second
quarter. Real outlays for construction in July stood more than 5-1/2
percent above the average of the preceding three months. The substantial
advances in state and local expenditures were largely financed by the
continued strong marketing of long-term, tax-exempt securities.

II-20
The fiscal position of the sector appears weaker than in 1984.
The combined operating and capital account surplus was down to $4-1/2
billion in the second quarter from $11 billion at year end. The surplus
may drop lower in coming months as a result of significant tax cuts
passed by eight states for fiscal 1986. While tax increases in recent
legislative sessions have been numerous, many will be quite small because
they are largely limited to cigarettes, alcohol, and fuel; large tax
increases occurred in only five states.
Exports and imports
The merchandise trade deficit fell in July to $117 billion (annual
rate), about 10 percent below the second-quarter average. The shrinkage of
the deficit in July was attributable to a drop in the highly-volatile
series on imports that was only partly offset by a moderate decline in
exports. On average, for the four-month period ending in July, the value
of imports was very much the same as in the first-quarter. For exports,
much of the drop in July was in agricultural commodities; the value of
nonagricultural exports was about the same as the second-quarter average.
Despite the falling exchange value of the dollar, prices of non-oil
imports in both June and July continued downward and were about 1 percent
lower than in the first quarter. The price of imported oil in July was
about 75 cents per barrel less than in June and only a bit above the
average of the second quarter. (Further discussion of international
developments is included in section IV.)
Prices, wages, and productivity
Incoming wage and price data suggest that inflation remains gener-
ally moderate. Consumer prices have risen 0.2 percent in each of the

II-21
last four months since last April, while producer prices of finished
goods are up only slightly so far this year.
As discussed in more detail in the agricultural section, farm
prices have declined since the beginning of the year, and developments
in agricultural commodity markets suggest a further drop in September.
At the consumer level, there have been monthly fluctuations, but on
balance food prices have risen very little since December.
The CPI energy component, which spurted briefly in March and April
has moved lower in recent months. Moreover, the outlook for world crude
oil prices suggests sustained downward pressures over the near term.
Outside the food and energy areas, consumer prices have risen at
a 0.3 percent monthly pace since the first quarter. After a runup in
the first quarter, prices of goods other than food and energy on
average have declined. Although swings in used car prices accounted
for much of this pattern, low-priced imports--such as television sets---
also have been a factor. Prices of services, in contrast, have risen
recently at a 0.5 percent monthly rate, above their pace earlier this
year; higher rents and telephone charges account for the pickup in the
service component.
At the producer level, prices of capital equipment have risen
slowly since the first quarter and are only 2 percent above a year
earlier. Prices of intermediate materials, less food and energy, have
been relatively flat for about a year.
So far in 1985, wages in the private nonfarm economy have con-
tinued to advance at the moderate rates of 1984. The hourly earnings
index for production and nonsupervisory workers was unchanged in August

II-22
after a small decline the month before; this measure has risen about 3
percent over the past 12 months. In manufacturing, wage increases have
diminished from their higher rates early this year. Outside of manufac-
turing, wage adjustments remain small.
Revised data show productivity in the nonfarm business sector
rising 1 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 1985, after
a 3.1 percent decline in the first quarter. Over the past four quarters,
productivity has been essentially flat; thus, the moderate increases in
compensation per hour were completely passed through into unit labor
costs, which are now measured to be 4-1/4 percent above a year earlier.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The monetary aggregates surged in August, again paced by strength in
the more liquid types of deposits. M1 diverged further from its long-run
target range and boosted M2 to the top of the parallel band associated with
its 1985 target. Growth in nontransactions M2 was unchanged from July, and
a preference for shorter-term assets remained evident, with savings deposits
and MMDAs once again increasing rapidly and small time deposits decreasing
further. M3 growth also rose in August as the decline in the M3-only
component abated. Data for early September suggest some deceleration in
M1 and M2, but a step-up in M3 growth.
In the early part of the intermeeting period, interest rates were
subject to upward pressure as the market reacted to the rapid money growth
and to economic data that were stronger than generally expected. More
recently, however, market rates have declined after publication of some
disappointing economic indicators, and short-term rates fell further after
the announcement last weekend of a five-nation program to temper the dollar's
exchange rate. On net, private money market rates are about unchanged over
the period, but Treasury bill rates are somewhat lower--partly because of
a paydown of bills related to debt ceiling problems. Long-term bond yields
are a bit higher, with comparatively large increases for municipal securities,
while commitment rates on home loans are little changed.
Spreads between Treasury rates and those on obligations of some federal
agencies have widened over the period, owing mainly to heightened concern
about the financial condition of the Farm Credit System. Problems related
to EPIC, a real estate investment firm, had a more limited impact, affecting
only a narrow segment of the mortgage-backed securities market.

Debt growth appears to have continued brisk in August, as many
borrowers were taking on long-term debt at the same time that depositors
were shifting toward more liquid assets. Gross corporate bond issuance was
especially heavy in August, before moderating in September. Boosted by a
large volume of refunding bonds, offerings of tax-exempt securities remained
substantial in August and September. Similarly, issuance of federally
related mortgage-backed securities has continued strong. By contrast,
Treasury borrowing slackened somewhat in August, and a binding debt ceiling
limited borrowing in September. Consumer credit expansion appears to have
slowed in the summer from its earlier elevated pace, but was likely boosted
around the end of August when sales of new cars soared in response to
concessionary loan rates at finance companies.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 jumped at more than a 20 percent clip last month as double-digit
growth in demand deposits resumed, and other checkable deposits accelerated
to a 38 percent annual rate, the most rapid increase in 2-1/2 years. From
their authorization in January 1983, Super NOW accounts generally had
dominated inflows to other checkable deposits. Since last May, however,
60 percent of the increase in not seasonally adjusted OCD has been in
regular NOWs. The opportunity cost of regular NOWs over this period was
lower than at any time since this account was authorized nationwide at the
end of 1980.
The August increase lifted M1 further above its 3 to 8 percent
target range, and with partial data for September suggesting still rapid,
albeit slower growth, an even larger rate of decline in M1 velocity in the
third quarter than over the first half is virtually assured. Statistical

estimates of the historical relationship between M1 and income and inter-
est rates fail to explain the prodigious expansion of M1 so far in 1985,
especially in the third quarter. Yet staff inquiries of depository
institutions and businesses have uncovered no evidence that any widespread
factors other than lower interest rates--operating via both opportunity
cost and compensating balance channels--have contributed importantly to M1
growth. It is plausible, as some market sources have suggested, that the
strength in M1 and other liquid deposits partly reflects a widely held
expectation--or hope--among savers that rates on term accounts will
rebound; many of these individuals may be hesitant to roll over maturing
time deposits, especially if those deposits had carried returns well into
double digits.
The pickup of M2 growth in August, to an annual rate of 11-1/4
percent, is attributable to the acceleration of M1. Nontransactions M2
growth was unchanged last month as the sharp decline in small time deposits
left growth in retail deposits weaker, about offsetting a swing from con-
traction to expansion in overnight RPs and Eurodollars. The rise in over-
night RPs apparently was related to a midmonth rise in Treasury securities
holdings of large banks in their trading accounts, coinciding with the
midquarter financing.
M3 expanded at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate last month, about twice
the July pace. Contributing to the acceleration was an increase in large
time deposits after two months of significant declines. In August, thrift
institutions reduced the rate at which they ran off large time deposits,
and commercial banks were net issuers for the first time in three months.
Banks' demands for managed liabilities were boosted during the month by an

$8-1/4 billion drop in U.S. government deposits, but most of this outflow
evidently was covered by a $7-1/4 billion net inflow from foreign branches.
A slowing in both investments and loan growth contributed to a drop
in bank credit expansion in August to a 7 percent annual rate. Total loans
decelerated for the fourth consecutive month, and growth over the third
quarter as a whole likely will be in single digits for the first time in
more than two years. The weakening in loans in August was concentrated in
security loans, a highly erratic series which ran off sharply after several
months of rapid expansion. Nevertheless, growth in domestically booked
business loans was a sluggish 3-3/4 percent, and consumer loan growth
declined to an 11 percent rate, its lowest this year. Preliminary data
indicate that the growth of consumer loans may have slowed again in Sep-
tember. Concessionary financing programs introduced by car manufacturers
and their finance subsidiaries in mid-August likely began to restrain
automobile loans at banks during August. Real estate loans meanwhile
continued to grow at about the pace seen for the last year.
Business Finance
Overall business credit growth likely moved higher in August, even
though there was little evidence of it in bank loans. While both commer-
cial paper and gross bond issuance posted strong increases, the continued
weak growth in domestically booked business loans and a contraction in
loans at foreign offices left total business loans at banks up at just a
1-3/4 percent annual rate last month. A sharp rise in commercial paper at
the beginning of the month lifted the combined growth rate of business
loans and paper to 7-1/4 percent, still somewhat below the second-quarter
pace and less than half the average rate last year. In early September,

commercial paper fell below its average August level, and business loan
growth at large banks was entirely attributable to merger and acquisition
financings.
The relatively sluggish growth in short-term borrowing in 1985
contrasts with the robust pace of net bond issuance by nonfinancial
corporations. The contrast has become sharper in recent quarters as
long-term interest rates have hovered around their five-year lows, and
many corporations have turned toward the bond markets to lock in these
lower rates. In addition, a larger portion of gross bond issues in the
third quarter has been in the longer-term category, even though short-
maturity borrowings continue to offer an initial savings of some 350 to
400 basis points. In the third quarter, 37 percent of the volume of new
offerings had maturities of 20 years or more, following a year and a half
of more predominantly short-term issues.

estimated to have fallen back to a more normal level in September. The

August volume was second only to that last January, and to avoid depressing
the prices of these offerings excessively, firms spread their new issues
across a number of sub-markets. More than $2 billion equivalent of funds
has been raised in 12 different foreign currencies this quarter, including
a rash of dual-currency yen/dollar issues in August which were targeted at
Japanese investors.1 There also was a renewed surge in the volume of CMOs
in August, fed by the very heavy issuance of federally related pass-through
securities in recent months.
U.S. Government Securities Markets
Marketable federal borrowing was constrained in September by the
debt ceiling, and the outlook for Treasury operations in the fourth quarter
is clouded by uncertainties concerning the timing of congressional action
to raise the limit. To date, the full Congress has not acted on the
Treasury's request to lift the debt ceiling for FY1986 to just above $2
trillion. Although the federal government is expected to be able to meet
all its expenditures through mid-October by drawing down cash balances, the
debt ceiling constraint has already forced the Treasury to pay down bills
and to postpone auctions of 4- and 7-year notes and 20-year bonds, which
normally constitute the end-of-quarter financing.
The staff is estimating a combined (on- and off-budget) federal
deficit of nearly $49 billion in the third quarter. Special issues to
state and local units continue sizable, but the bulk of the $46 billion of
borrowing has been through marketable coupon securities. In addition, the
Treasury's cash balance is expected to decline over the quarter, providing
$6-1/2 billion to finance the deficit. Looking ahead, the combined deficit
1. See Section IV, International Developments, for additional discussion.

III-12
for the fourth quarter is projected by the staff at about $70 billion,
nearly all expected to be financed by borrowing from the public. In
addition to regularly scheduled financings, there is likely to be a catch-
up, once the debt ceiling is raised, from auctions cut back or postponed
late in September.
The federally sponsored credit agencies reduced their borrowing in
the third quarter from the elevated pace of the second quarter. The largest
reductions were those of Fannie Mae, which supplemented its borrowing
during the quarter by selling larger amounts of pass-through securities in
the financial markets, and of the Federal Home Loan Banks, which drew down
liquid assets. Also during the third quarter, the paydown of debt by the
Farm Credit System accelerated.
The highly publicized problems of the Farm Credit System recently
have been reflected in a deterioration of the market for its securities.
Net income of the Farm Credit Banks declined sharply in the second quarter,
owing to a marked increase in the provisions for losses on loans. Moreover,
the Farm Credit Administration expects that a further rise in loan-loss

provisioning in the second half of the year will turn the Farm Credit
System's small first-half profits into a loss for the year of $350 million
to $450 million.
The system appears to have adequate resources to absorb this year's
losses if it retains its ability to market debt; at the end of June, the
Farm Credit Banks had a surplus account (essentially accumulated retained
earnings) of $4.2 billion.1,2 The Farm Credit System, however, will not be
able to absorb the current rate of losses for long. Especially worrisome
is evidence that loan problems have begun to appear at the Federal Land
Banks, which provide longer-term loans for the purchase of farms and
machinery. Previously, problem loans were thought to be concentrated in
the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, which provide short-term production
loans. This development led the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration
to announce that the system probably would require substantial federal
assistance within the next 18 to 24 months.
That announcement prompted considerable widening of the yield spreads
between the securities of the Farm Credit System and Treasury obligations,
as well as some widening of yield spreads on the securities of other
federally sponsored agencies. Securities of the Federal Home Loan Banks
have been the most affected, primarily because of reports that the FHLBs
1. The Farm Credit System recently changed its regulations so that the Farm
Credit Administration has greater control over the capital of the system.
Previously, the 37 Farm Credit Banks had to approve assistance to financially
weak banks in the system.
2. The system also had $5.0 billion of capital stock and participation
certificates, but these accounts represent "paper capital". Farmers who
borrow from a Farm Credit Bank are required to purchase capital stock
equal to a certain percentage of the loan. This capital stock usually is
"purchased" by signing a loan agreement for an amount greater than the
volume of funds actually advanced to the farmer. When the farmer repays
the funds advanced, the loan agreement and capital stock are retired.

III-14
might use their access to the financial markets to help fund the FSLIC's
assistance to weak thrift institutions. The 6- and 9-month securities of
the Farm Credit System generally are trading 50 to 90 basis points above
the yields on Treasury securities, but some trades with spreads in excess
of 100 basis points also have been reported.1 In the past, yields on these
securities have been close to those on Treasury securities.
There is some question about how meaningful quoted yields in secondary
trading are, however; since the market is thin, quotes at different dealers
vary widely, and spreads seem to widen sharply when large investors attempt
to reduce their holdings of Farm Credit securities.2 A good reading on the
magnitude of current risk premiums on Farm Credit securities will be the
spread on new 6-month securities to be priced September 25, which the
market expects to be 75 to 80 basis points; the usual 9-month issue was
omitted from this offering.
Tax-Exempt Securities Markets
Issuance of tax-exempt bonds has remained brisk in recent months,
fluctuating around $12 billion--well above the $9 billion pace averaged in
1984. Refunding bonds continue to account for around a third of the offer-
ings, bolstered by relatively low interest rates and concerns that advance
1. The 6- and 9-month securities are scheduled for issue every month by the
Farm Credit System. It also periodically issues securities with maturities
in the 1- to 10-year range, and the average maturity of its debt is just
under 2-1/2 years. Because most of its loans to farmers carry variable
interest rates, the Farm Credit System is not directly exposed to interest
rate risk by focusing issuance in the short-term market; however, the
floating-rate characteristic of these loans tends to heighten credit risk
in a period of sharply rising interest rates.
2. Accurate measures of risk premiums are available in the very short-term
market where the Farm Credit System issues "discount notes" on a daily basis.
These spreads over Treasury securities were reported to have risen to the
neighborhood of 90 to 100 basis points, compared with spreads of about 15

Offerings of bonds for new capital, both for public and private
purposes, have remained substantial. Issuance of industrial development
bonds (IDBs), which also are threatened with extinction by the tax reform
proposal, appears to have picked up in a trend that is likely to accelerate
toward year-end. Offerings of IDBs to fund multifamily housing projects have
been strong all year, but the volume of other types of IDBs, for which
evidence is fragmentary, had appeared to be rather sparse during the first
half of the year.
Mortgage Markets
Despite the difficulties related to the EPIC situation, the home mort-
gage market on the whole has been fairly stable since the last FOMC meeting.
In the primary market, interest rates have changed little, with adjustable-
rate loans still enjoying a relatively large initial interest rate advantage.

III-16
Reflecting this advantage, adjustable-rate mortgages have continued to be
popular; in early August, just over half of conventional home loans closed
had an adjustable-rate provision.
The response of the mortgage securities markets to the problems faced
by the EPIC partnerships and insurers of their mortgages has been limited.
Although even federally guaranteed securities were affected initially, their
prices promptly moved back into closer alignment with Treasury issues, and
yields on thrift institution bonds backed by privately insured mortgages
increased only slightly relative to those of other issuers, because the
thrift bonds generally are over-collateralized. The market for pass-throughs
relying on private insurance has shown sustained signs of weakness. Prices
have been down, bid-asked spreads have widened, and trading has been lighter
for all issues, particularly those involving the mortgage insurers most at
risk in the EPIC defaults. However, no panic selling has been reported,
and any losses to securities holders stemming directly from EPIC were
expected to be minor.
New issue volume for pass-through securities guaranteed by federally
sponsored agencies in August remained near the previous month's record
high. Issuance was again bolstered by heavy swapping of loans for FHLMC or
FNMA securities, but GNMA securities, which carry explicit government
backing, accounted for a somewhat larger share than in most months this
year. Data covering the first half of September indicate that heavy
issuance of federally related pass-through securities has continued.
Press reports and inquiries among trade sources suggest that the EPIC
incident has not had a more substantial damping effect on the home mortgage
market to date largely because EPIC's securities and practices were so

The EPIC securities were privately placed and privately insured
issues, while nearly all mortgage pass-through securities (98 percent in
1984) are guaranteed by federally related agencies and publicly traded.
Moreover, the conventional mortgage loans backing the EPIC securities were
originated at loan-to-value ratios that were exceptionally high by industry
standards. Also, the underlying real estate--investor-held rental properties,
geographically concentrated, and either model homes or remnants of unsold
inventories--was much riskier than usual. Finally, the EPIC properties had
been purchased, and the mortgages financed, within the same group of firms;
ordinarily, property ownership and mortgage financing are widely dispersed.
The most noticeable impact of the EPIC situation has been on the
private mortgage insurance industry. TICOR, the mortgage insurance company

with the greatest exposure in the EPIC situation, recently announced that
it had suspended the writing of all new mortgage insurance, in view of
uncertainties about its ultimate losses in the EPIC case. Trade sources
expect that other mortgage insurance companies will be less seriously
affected and that no major disruption is likely in the availability of
mortgage insurance. Even so, the trend toward tighter qualification
standards and higher insurance premiums on a broad range of conventional
home mortgages will likely be intensified by the EPIC incident.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit expanded at a 15 percent annual rate in
July. Coupled with June growth of 12-3/4 percent, the July increase
provides evidence of a significant slowing from growth rates in excess of
20 percent earlier in the year. The deceleration in recent months was
particularly apparent in the revolving credit category, which had soared
during the first part of the year.
Consumer installment credit expansion probably continued to subside
in August. Bank lending to consumers weakened during the month, and most
of an anticipated surge in auto credit expansion related to promotional
interest rates offered by the financing subsidiaries of various automakers
may have been delayed into September because of a lag between the time that
paperwork on a loan is handled at the dealership and the time that the loan
is entered on the books of the ultimate creditor.
The incentive-financing programs initiated by the big three auto-
makers in mid-August are considerably broader than those in force earlier
this year, or those available during most of 1983. Below-market financing
(at interest rates of 7.5 to 7.7 percent) is being offered on a wide selec-

tion of 1985 models. Meanwhile, interest rates on new-car loans at a
sample of commercial banks eased to 12-3/4 percent in early August, the
lowest value for that series in six years.
Historically, interest rates on new-car loans at the captive finance
companies have exceeded those at banks by 1 to 2 percentage points, but in
recent years the finance companies' reduced-rate programs frequently have
brought their average rate below the bank figure. Compared with credit
costs at banks, the special incentive rates now offered by the auto finance
companies would reduce the monthly payment on a $10,000 48-month loan by
about $25, resulting in before-tax savings of $1,200 or so in interest
expense over the life of the loan.1
Incoming data indicate that households experienced somewhat more
difficulty in meeting loan obligations during the second quarter. The
number of personal bankruptcy cases climbed 9 percent from the first-quar-
ter level and was up 16 percent from last year's second quarter. Consumer
loan delinquencies showed small increases during the quarter to a level
midway between their highs and lows of the past 15 years. Evidence on the
trend in mortgage delinquencies was mixed. The series for FSLIC-insured
institutions reported by the FHLBB hit a new high in the second quarter,
while the Mortgage Bankers Association series covering a wider range of
institutions showed a drop in the proportion of home mortgages delinquent
60 days or more, to a still-high 1.83 percent from the previous quarter's
record.

is approximately $935.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average value of the dollar has decreased by about 2
percent on balance since the last FOMC meeting, as shown in Chart 1.
This movement was dominated by the drop of more than 4 percent which
took place on September 23 following the announcement by G-5 finance
ministers and central bank governors that exchange rates should better
reflect fundamental economic conditions.
In the period before the G-5 meeting, movements in the dollar
continued to be strongly influenced by shifting expectations about the
strength of the U.S. economy. From August 20 to September 11, the
dollar appreciated by more than 5 percent as newly released data --
particularly the drop in the unemployment rate in August -- suggested to
market participants that the U.S. economy was growing more strongly than
they had previously thought. In the following ten-day period ending
on September 20, the dollar declined by about 3 percent when U.S. growth
expectations were revised downward in response to additional
information, particularly a smaller-than-anticipated "flash" estimate of
third-quarter real GNP growth.
The sharp drop of the dollar on Monday, September 23 following the
G-5 meeting appeared to reflect a belief in the market that officials
were prepared to take strong, concerted action to bring about a lower
dollar on foreign exchange markets. The dollar's fall that day was
evenly distributed among the major foreign currencies; the dollar's
depreciation ranged from 4.6 percent against the pound to 5.1 percent
against the yen. On Tuesday, September 24, the dollar moved slightly

The South African rand came under strong exchange market pressure
in late July as domestic unrest in that country intensified. The rand
weakened further in early August when increasing numbers of U.S. and
foreign banks began reducing their exposure to public and private South
African institutions. On August 27, the South African authorities
announced a five-day suspension of trading in their foreign exchange and
stock markets, following a 10 percent one-day fall in the value of the
rand. While trading on South African financial markets was suspended,
the government announced a freeze on most foreign debt repayments until
the end of the year. In order to prevent investment capital from
leaving the country, a dual exchange rate regime was instituted with a
relatively free rate for commercial transactions and a less advantageous
rate for financial transactions by nonresidents. When South African
markets reopened on September 2, the commercial rand quickly rose to 45
cents after closing on August 27 at 36 cents. However, in subsequent
weeks the commercial rand again weakened and is currently about 39 cents.
The financial rand has traded recently at about a 5 percent discount
relative to the commercial rate.

IV-5
U.S. bank lending to foreigners in the second quarter. Claims on
foreigners of U.S. chartered banks resumed their decline in the second
quarter of 1985, decreasing about $9 billion (2 percent). As was the
case in most of 1984, the drop in total claims was concentrated on the
G-10 countries and offshore banking centers.
Since the beginning of 1984, U.S. bank claims on the non-OPEC
developing countries have changed hardly at all; they show a small
decrease in the first half of this year. There was no involuntary
lending to these countries in the first half of 1985 except for Mexico's
drawing in March of the final $950 million of the bank loan signed in
April 1984. As happened in 1983-84, actual net new lending to non-OPEC
developing countries this year was probably somewhat less negative, or
perhaps even slightly positive, than is measured by changes in
outstanding claims, because some loans are removed from banks' books by
loan write-offs, exercise of official guarantees, and other decreases.
Claims on OPEC countries, Eastern Europe and the smaller developed
countries show small decreases for the past six quarters, while claims
on the G-10 countries and offshore banking centers at the end of June
were down $21 billion (13 percent) from the level of end-1983. Of that
amount, a decline in dollar-denominated interbank claims accounted for
approximately the entire amount.

U.S. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
Net capital inflows in July occurred through banks as well as
through an increase in foreign net purchases of U.S.corporate bonds and
continued foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities,
particularly by Japanese residents. (See Summary Table of U.S.
International Transactions.)
Banking data for July show a sizeable net inflow into banking
offices in the United States from abroad (including internatioal
bankings facilities) when measured on an end-month to end-month basis.
(see line 1.) This partially reflects a $2 billion reduction in
deposits of U.S. bank holdings companies with the offshore offices of
affiliated U.S. banks; over the same period commercial paper issued by
bank holding companies fell by a similar amount.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds (line 2a)
increased by over $4 billion in July, bringing the total for the first
seven months of the year to nearly $22 billion. During this period
there has been a marked increased in the proportion of Euromarket
securities issued by U.S. corporations that have been denominated at
issue in foreign currencies, particularly yen and Swiss francs. The
proportion of straight dollar denominated issued fell to nearly 50
percent during July and August compared with an average of nearly 70
percent over the first half of 1985. Market commentary has suggested
that the increased interest in securities denominated in foreign
currency may indicate sensitivity to increasing exchange risk on the
part of international investors.
A significant portion of the non-dollar issues have been in the
form of dual currency bonds. The principal of these securities is

denominated in U.S. dollars while interest is paid in a foreign currency.
To date, instruments with Swiss franc and yen coupons have been issued;
in August yen issues were far greater in number and value. These
instruments appear to appeal particularly to Japanese investors because
of certain accounting considerations that make high current interest
payments combined with the risk of future capital losses attractive.
Like zero coupon bonds, these instruments appear to provide the Japanese
investor with desired financial characteristics that are not now
available in the domestic or Euro yen markets.
Japanese purchase of U.S. Treasury issues have also been large in
recent months. In July, Japanese net purchases of Treasury bonds and
notes totalled more than $3.5 billion, more than accounting for the
total of private foreign net purchases of Treasury securities. Japanese
purchases of U.S. Treasury securities is the first seven months of 1985
came to nearly $10 billion, out of a total of $11 billion of U.S. net
sales to private foreign residents.
The Japanese Ministry of Finance reports that net foreign bond
buying by Japan for June and July totalled more than $15 billion. U.S.
Treasury data indicate that approximately 40 percent of this total was
U.S. Treasury securities. Recent market reports suggest serious concern
exists within the Japanese government that unrestrained capital outflows
may serve to weaken the yen and exacerbate both that country's trade
surplus and protectionist pressures on its major trading partners.
Press accounts indicate that the Japanese government recently may have
entertained placing controls on the export of capital and may be
currently seeking to persuade Japanese securities firms to approach
increased purchases of foreign securities with greater caution.

IV-10
Another recent development with possible implications for the
yen/dollar exchange rate is the introduction of a yen-denominated bond
in the United States. This $144 million equivalent offering by the
Asian Development bank represents the first yen-denominated bond
publicly offered in the U.S. market in the postwar period and only the
third foreign currency issue since the first such issue in December of
1984. Because these three issues are registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, they can be sold publicly to investors in the
United States who are prohibited from purchasing instruments not
registered with the S.E.C.. Thus such investors may now more readily
diversify the currency exposures of their portfolios.
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States increased in
July as G-10 countries continued to build their dollar holdings
following the sizeable net sale of dollars through foreign exchange
intervention in the first quarter. Preliminary data for August and the
first week of September show little change in foreign official holdings
at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Data recently released by the Commerce Department show that foreign
direct investment in the United States was $4.9 billion in the second
quarter, up from $2.1 billion in the first quarter. The large inflow in
the second quarter was primarily the result of two large loans by
European companies to their U.S. affiliates that were related to
corporate takeovers publicized in 1984. U.S. direct investment abroad
shifted to a net outflow of $4.1 billion in the second quarter from a
$1.9 billion net inflow in the previous quarter. The statistical
discrepancy for the second quarter was an inflow of $8.9 billion,
bringing the total for the first half of 1985 to $25.9 billion.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In July, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was smaller than that
recorded in June and for the second quarter as a whole. The decrease in
the deficit resulted from a sharp drop in imports that was partly offset
by a moderate decline in exports. Data for August are scheduled to be
released on Friday, September 27.
Import data oscillate widely from month to month. The decline in
July brought the level of imports below rates recorded during the first
half of the year; the decline was widespread across all major commodity
categories. There were notable decreases in industrial supplies
(particularly in steel and nonferrous metals), in machinery (especially
business machines), in trucks from Canada, in passenger cars from Japan
and Europe, in foods, and in other consumer goods.

The value of oil imports also fell substantially from the June
level. This decline reflected a drop in volume of one million barrels
per day from the June rate; the decline from the second-quarter average
was smaller. The average price of imported oil dropped by about 75
cents per barrel from the June price and slightly more from the
second-quarter average.

The value of exports also fell in July from both the June and
second-quarter levels. Much of the drop was in agricultural
commodities, particularly wheat; both prices and quantities declined.
While the value of nonagricultural items decreased from June levels, the
value recorded in July was about the same as the second-quarter rate.
Compared with the second-quarter average, a decline in July in exports
of machinery was offset by increases in exports of aircraft and of
automotive products to Canada.
The Department of Commerce pointed out in its press release of
August 30 that monthly totals of both exports and imports include a
carryover from prior months' transactions; this results when import
entries and export declarations transmitted by the U.S. Customs Service
reach the Census Bureau too late for inclusion into the current
statistical month. In July, the carryover amounted to 39 percent of the
July monthly unadjusted total value for imports and 11 percent for

IV-14
exports. The net carryover for a 12-month period is small; it is
estimated that calendar-year 1984 totals (exports, imports and trade
balance) would have been affected by slightly more than one percent.
However, the amount of the carryover varies from month to month and for
an individual month or quarter may be proportionally large and affect in
a significant way the monthly or quarterly variability of the data.
U.S. Current Account in 1985-Q2.
The U.S. current account was in deficit by $127 billion, SAAR, in
the second quarter of 1985; this was a slightly larger deficit than in
the first quarter. A larger merchandise trade deficit (exports dropped
by 4-1/2 percent and imports increased slightly) was partly offset by
increased income receipts from investment abroad.
Most of the increase was in receipts of income from U.S. direct
investment abroad and was accounted for by a shift from large capital
losses to small capital gains primarily in response to the decline in
the exchange value of the dollar. The changes in other service
transactions were relatively small. See the table on the next page.

Foreign Economic Developments. The pace of economic activity in the
major foreign industrial countries rose on balance in recent months, but
progress remains uneven and influenced by special factors.
Second-quarter real GNP growth accelerated strongly in Japan and
Germany, while Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom maintained their
growth rates experienced in the first quarter. These outcomes reflect
some rebounds from unusually weak first-quarter performances in Japan
and Germany, and the end of the coal miners' strike in the United
Kingdom. The most recent industrial production data for these countries
show output significantly above year-earlier levels. Industrial
activity in France and Italy remains subdued, with little or no growth
in the second quarter. Consumer price inflation abroad has remained
low, with a weighted average year-over-year rate for the six major
countries currently at about 4.5 percent. Among those countries with
still relatively high inflation rates, France has recorded slower rates
recently, while Italy's year-over-year inflation rate has remained above
8.5 percent since late last year. The trade and current account
surpluses of Japan and Germany rose strongly in the second quarter.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan real GNP grew 7.9 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, rebounding strongly from revised
growth of only 0.8 percent in the first quarter, but private sector
investment and exports have been erratic. Real GNP in the first half of
1985 increased about 5 percent (s.a.a.r.) from the average level in the
second half of 1984.
Recent data on Japanese industrial production also suggest that the
economy is expanding, although at a slower pace than experienced last

year. Reversing its decline in June, Japanese IP grew 1.7 percent
(s.a.) in July to 6.3 percent above its year-earlier level. Retail
sales also rose strongly in July, advancing 1.4 percent (s.a.). Housing
starts, however, declined for the fourth consecutive month and in July
were 0.5 percent below their year-earlier levels.
The Tokyo consumer price index rose 2.7 percent during the
12 months ending in August, down slightly from the 12-month inflation
rate recorded in July. Japan's external surpluses continue at record
rates. For the first seven months of 1985, the cumulative trade surplus
was $50 billion (s.a.a.r.). Through July, the cumulative current
account surplus was $44 billion (s.a.a.r.), up more than $12 billion
from the corresponding period in 1984.
Concerned about growth of protectionist sentiment among Japan's
trading partners, Prime Minister Nakasone instructed the Economic
Planning Agency on September 3 to compile by end-September a list of
domestic expansionary measures that would have an immediate impact on
Japan's current account. Major areas singled out for study include
private housing construction, plant and equipment investment, and
consumption. Another working group, set up as part of Japan's "Action
Plan" (announced on July 30), has been looking at measures that would
expand domestic demand mostly in the medium term, and this group is
scheduled to report to the Prime Minister by October 10. Concerns about
growing foreign protectionist sentiment led the Japanese Ministry of
Finance in early September to ask banks and securities companies to
exercise self-restraint on foreign bond purchases. It is hoped that an

IV-21
associated reduction in Japanese demand for foreign assets would
strengthen the yen.
Industrial production in Germany rose 2 percent in June, and more
recent indicators of wholesale sales as well as business and consumer
sentiments point to relatively strong demand through this summer.
Preliminary real GNP data for the second quarter indicate a strong
rebound (about 6 percent s.a.a.r.) from the depressed first-quarter
level. The rate of unemployment, however, has remained at the near
record level of 9.3 percent (s.a.) through July.
Consumer prices barely rose between January and August this year
(0.4 percent a.r.). The year-on-year rate in August was 2.1 percent.
Wages and productivity rose at an approximately equal pace in the first
half of this year, compared with the first half of 1984, so that unit
labor costs remained flat. In addition, import prices, reflecting
exchange rate developments, have fallen in recent months.
Germany's trade surplus through July was $12.6 billion (n.s.a.)
compared with $8.5 billion for the same period last year. The current
account surplus increased by about the same margin, from $0.4 billion in
January-July 1984, to $4.1 billion this year.
The federal budget for 1986 is currently being debated in the
Bundestag. According to the proposed budget, spending will rise by 2.4
percent over budgeted 1985 spending, and revenues will increase by 2
percent. The federal deficit, at DM 25 billion, (1.4 percent of 1985
GNP), will increase only slightly.
Recent economic data from France indicate continued slow growth in
real economic activity. Real GDP grew by only 2.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in

IV-22
the second quarter, following a decline of 1.2 percent in the first
quarter. On a year-over-year basis, second-quarter real GDP was up by
only 1.4 percent. Industrial production decreased by 1.5 percent (s.a.)
in June, leaving industrial production unchanged from its year-earlier
level. The unemployment rate remained unchanged in August at 10.6
percent (s.a.).
The year-over-year French consumer price inflation rate, after
remaining virtually unchanged at 6-1/2 percent during the first half of
the year, moved lower in July and August. The 0.1 percent (n.s.a.)
increase in consumer prices in August lowered the year-over-year
inflation rate to 5.6 percent, only slightly above the government's
revised 5 percent year-over-year inflation target for the end of this
year.
The trade balance moved back into deficit by $430 million in July
following the first monthly trade surplus of the year in June. For the
first seven months of the year the trade deficit was $3.2 billion
(s.a.a.r.), compared with $2.7 billion for the year 1984. The current
account was in surplus by $500 million in the second quarter compared
with a deficit of nearly $800 million in the first quarter.
On September 18 President Mitterrand's cabinet approved a draft
budget for 1986. The target for the overall budget deficit remains 3
percent of GDP. (The actual deficit rate so far this year has been only
slightly above target.) Both expenditures and revenues are scheduled to
increase by slightly less than 4 percent. About 1 percent of public
sector jobs will be eliminated through attrition. Income tax rates will
be reduced by 3 percent. Selected business taxes will also be lowered.

IV-23
The compulsory loan imposed on higher-income taxpayers in April 1983
will be repaid ahead of schedule in January of next year. The overall
stance of the proposed budget--the last for the current government
before legislative elections next March--continues the policy of
relative macroeconomic restraint first adopted over two years ago.
Real GDP (average measure) in the United Kingdom grew 4.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter to 5 percent above its year-earlier
level. Investment had risen sharply in the first quarter and then fell
in the second quarter, as capital purchases had accelerated prior to the
April 1 reduction in depreciation allowances applicable for tax purposes.
The resumption of coal production following the ending in March of the
coal miners' strike, however, provided an offsetting boost to measured
growth. In July, the index of industrial production fell 1 percent
(s.a.).
The sharp acceleration in U.K. price inflation that took place in
the spring now seems to have been temporary. The retail price index
fell slightly in July and rose only 0.3 percent in August to a level 6.2
percent above August 1984. The recent 1-1/4 percentage point drop in
mortgage rates should moderate measured inflation further in September.
The U.K. trade deficit was $3.2 billion (s.a.a.r.) in August. For
the first seven months of 1985, the cumulative trade deficit was $3.1
billion (s.a.a.r.), and the cumulative current account surplus was $2.7
billion (s.a.a.r.) The trade deficit for 1984 was $5.7 billion.
On September 2, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced several
changes in her cabinet. The changes are thought to reflect increased
government priority on reducing unemployment, which rose slightly to

IV-24
13.2 percent (s.a.) in August, and a desire to prepare for the next
general election, which must be held by spring of 1988.
Real GNP in Canada rose 4.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second
quarter of 1985, matching its first-quarter growth. The bulk of this
increase was accounted for by business fixed investment, up 22 percent
(s.a.a.r.) and consumer expenditure, up 5 percent (s.a.a.r.). But even
with the large increase in business spending, business fixed investment
in the second quarter was still 12 percent below the 1981 average.
Industrial production increased 1.5 percent in June, the largest monthly
increase in six months. Unemployment in Canada declined to 10.3 percent
in August bringing the total decline, since January, to 0.9 percentage
points.
Canadian inflation continued to be moderate in 1985. Consumer
prices in August were only 4 percent above year-earlier levels. This
slower rate of inflation compares favorably with last year's pace of 4.5
percent. In addition, inflation in Canada's wholesale price index in
July was only 2.2 percent above last year's level. Meanwhile, Canada's
trade surplus through July was $13 billion (s.a.a.r.) compared with $16
billion for all of 1984. The current account balance narrowed in the
second quarter, declining to $0.3 billion from the first quarter's $0.6
billion.
On September 1, the government announced the failure of two
Canadian chartered banks, Canadian Commercial Bank (CCB) and Northland
Bank. Both banks were based in Alberta and had substantial quantities
of non-performing loans to the oil and agricultural sectors. CCB is
currently being liquidated while a "curator" is seeking a merger for

IV-25
Northland. The government intends to seek legislative authority to
compensate uninsured depositors for all outstanding deposits and to
propose reforms in the supervisory powers of the federal authorities.
The problems of these two banks have been characterized by government
officials as reflecting "particular and unique circumstances" and
reportedly do not imply any wider problem concerning the soundness of
the Canadian banking system. These were the first Canadian chartered
banks to collapse since 1923. The combined assets of the two banks
accounted for one percent of total bank assets in Canada.
Real GDP in Italy grew by 0.8 percent in the second quarter; growth
in the first half of this year compared with the second half of last
year was 1.9 percent (s.a.a.r.). Although industrial production grew by
2 percent in June, the second quarter was lower than the first quarter
level and the first half of 1985 was only slightly above the second half
of last year.
In August, the cost of living index was 8.6 percent above its level
in August 1984, indicating that inflation has not abated in the last 10
months. The official government survey of businessmen, conducted at the
beginning of July, indicated that businessmen expect easing of
inflationary pressures with moderate real economic expansion.
The trade deficit for the first six months of 1985 was $15 billion
(s.a.a.r.), as compared with $11 billion for all 1984.
The public sector deficit as measured by the Central Treasury cash
requirement in the period from January to July of 1985 was up over 40
percent from the same period in 1984. Central government receipts rose
by 9 percent, while expenditures grew 22 percent. The original target

IV-26
for 1985 for the deficit was equivalent to 15 percent of projected
GDP, but even this target seems to be an unrealistic goal now.

Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries. Mexico has
fallen out of compliance with its IMF program and will have to forego
the last three drawings under its EFF agreement, but, in view of the
recent earthquake, it may be eligible for emergency financial assistance
from the IMF. Argentina has completed the process leading to the
initial disbursement from its $4.2 billion bank credit and is expected
soon to reduce sharply its arrears, but difficulties loom ahead
regarding compliance with the end-September IMF performance tests. The
prospects that Brazil will succeed in negotiating an IMF program in the
near term were dealt a setback when the finance minister and central
bank president resigned. Venezuela is continuing to make slow progress
in registering private external debt for repayment at the preferential
exchange rate. The Philippines has not yet met the qualitative program
targets for the second IMF program review, and the September IMF drawing
is being delayed.
Individual Country Notes. Despite cuts in public spending
announced on three occasions this year, Mexico has fallen far out of
compliance with the 1985 public sector deficit target of 4.1 percent of
GDP specified under the program negotiated with the IMF in March.
Mexico is expected to remain out of compliance through the end of its
EFF program in December 1985 and will have to forego the final three
drawings totaling SDR 908 million. The second phase of the Mexican
multi-year debt rescheduling agreement was signed on August 29, amid
reports that creditor banks may be reluctant to extend loans to Mexico
on a voluntary basis in 1986. At the signing ceremony, Finance
Secretary Silva-Herzog noted that the agreement was "predicated upon two

IV-28
fundamental principles: full payment of interest and net new money.
However, if one of the assumptions does not hold, neither will the
other." In his State of the Nation address on September 1, President de
la Madrid stressed that Mexico must grow in order to be able to pay what
it owes, but he reaffirmed his belief that the debt problem will not be
solved by confrontation or by repudiating contracted obligations and
that solutions must be sought through dialogue and negotiations.
Mexican reserves declined by about $2.5 billion in the first eight
months of the year. Pressure on the so-called "super-free" exchange
rate increased in September. Even though the rate of crawl of the
controlled exchange rate was accelerated, the spread between the two
rates widened to about 30 percent on September 23. (The spread ranged
from 15 to 18 percent in the last three weeks of August.) Concern has
been growing over Mexico's lack of compliance with the IMF performance
tests, the decline in international reserves, the prospects for world
oil prices, the lagging non-oil exports, the upturn in the rate of
inflation (4.4 percent in August), the reported reluctance of creditor
banks to extend loans to Mexico on a voluntary basis in 1986, and the
failure of the government to announce new corrective measures. The
recent earthquakes in Mexico will complicate the establishment of a new
macroeconomic program, but Mexico may be eligible for emergency
financial assistance from the IMF.
Following reinstatement of Argentina's IMF stand-by agreement in
early August, the commercial bank financing package, consisting of a
$4.2 billion credit and the rescheduling of $13.4 billion in public and
private sector debts maturing in 1982-85, began to be signed on

IV-29
August 27. An initial disbursement of $2.2 billion from the new credit
in late September will provide the means for bringing interest on public
sector debt to banks current up to early September and for paying the
overdue $750 million balance of the 1982 commercial bank bridge loan.
Half of the $460 million drawn by Argentina in June under the $483
million bridge loan from the United States and 11 other countries was
repaid in August from the IMF drawing of that month. The balance is to
be repaid from the late September IMF drawing that is conditional on
Argentina's compliance with the end-July IMF performance tests. While
these tests appear likely to have been met, problems may arise regarding
compliance with the end-September conditions. The central bank is
continuing to provide subsidies to the domestic commercial banks and, as
a result, it may have difficulty achieving the planned reduction in its
operating losses, which have long been a source of monetary expansion.
In addition, there are doubts about the extent to which central govern-
ment transfers to the provinces have been reduced. On the plus side,
total tax collections were sharply higher in July and August than in
June. In August, consumer prices rose by 3.1 percent and wholesale
prices rose by 1.5 percent, apparently because of seasonal factors. The
free market exchange rate for the dollar has remained fairly stable for
about two months around a level representing a premium of about 17
percent above the official rate.
Brazil's finance minister and central bank president resigned
August 26 apparently in protest over the government's failure to attack
the prospective fiscal deficit for 1985. Completion of negotiations on
an IMF program is now unlikely until the end of 1985, at the earliest.

IV-30
For the interim, commercial bank creditors agreed in late August to
extend until mid-January 1986 the standstill on repayment of medium-term
loans maturing in 1985 and to continue at present levels the trade
lines, inter-bank lines, and the redeposit facility.
Inflation surged to 14 percent in August, a record monthly rate,
and is likely to finish the year with a 12-month rate of inflation far
above the 200 percent target of the government. Price controls intro-
duced by the new democratic government in March have been relaxed, but
further major adjustments in government enterprise prices for steel,
electricity, and oil may be needed during the fall to help reduce the
deficits of those enterprises. After subsiding during the first quarter
of 1985, Brazil's trade surplus again strengthened to about a $1.1
billion monthly rate through August and the current account balance is
likely to remain near zero in 1985. Industrial production during
January-July 1985 was 6.8 percent higher than during the same period
last year, and agricultural production has increased at a similar rate.
The final signing of the Venezuelan multi-year rescheduling agree-
ment will probably occur sometime this fall. Lack of progress in
reviewing applications to register private debt for repayment at the
preferential exchange rate has held up completion of the rescheduling.
The initial review of applications is now almost complete, but a flood
of appeals has caused Venezuela to extend the deadline for registration
to the end of this year.
After the Philippines drew the second tranche of SDR 106 million
from its IMF stand-by arrangement on July 31, the creditor banks
formally established a $3 billion short-term trade facility for the

IV-31
Philippines on August 5 and, on August 12, released the first tranche of
$400 million of the $925 million new money credit arranged last May. In
late August the creditor banks began negotiations with five major
Philippine public sector debtors aimed at rescheduling their external
debt by mid-November. The Philippines met the end-July performance
criteria under the IMF stand-by program, but has not yet met the quali-
tative program targets for the second program review (related to
structural reforms in the sugar and coconut sectors). Until this review
is satisfactorily completed, the Philippines will not be able to draw
the third IMF tranche of SDR 106 million, or receive the second
disbursement of $175 million under the $925 million new money facility.
A new letter of intent was submitted to the IMF on September 18, which,
if approved, would relax monetary and fiscal restraints somewhat in
order to stimulate economic activity.
