The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity expanded at a moderate rate, during the third
quarter, with real GNP estimated to have increased at a 3.3 percent
annual rate. A spurt in auto sales and a bulge in government purchases
contributed importantly to a sharp rise in final demand. But these gains
were partly offset by a drawdown in auto inventories and weakness in business
spending. Housing starts also were down, although sales figures suggest
that demand for housing has responded somewhat to lower mortgage rates.
Wage increases remained moderate, and price inflation slowed last quarter.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production edged down 0.1 percent in September, and has
advanced at an annual rate of only 1.5 percent during the first nine months
of this year. In September, gains were reported for defense and space
equipment and construction supplies. However, these advances were offset
by declines in other major components of the index, including consumer
durable goods and durable materials.
In September, the production of motor vehicles and parts fell sharply,
but this followed strong gains in July and August. As a result, for the
third quarter as a whole, motor vehicle output was responsible for about
two-thirds of the 1 percent annual growth in the total index. In addition
to a slight rise in auto assemblies in the third quarter, truck production
was at a 3-3/4 million unit rate, up from the 3-1/4 million unit pace in
the second quarter.
Domestic automakers are currently planning to produce at a 7.8 million
unit annual rate in the fourth quarter, down from earlier estimates and

slightly below the third-quarter rate. As a result of the strike against
Chrysler, October auto production will fall short of earlier expectations,
but Chrysler plans to make up for this shortfall in November.
While output of total products advanced at a 3 percent pace during the
past year, materials production has sagged, and in September was 1.5 percent
below the level of a year earlier. Durable goods materials have been par-
ticularly weak, owing largely to a sharp cutback in the production of semi-
conductors. The output of energy materials also has shown no growth as a
result of declines in the oil and gas extraction and coal mining industries.
Competition from abroad has contributed substantially to the depressed pro-
duction levels in many of the domestic materials industries, although
technological changes (such as the design of lighter-weight products) also
have been a factor.
The industrial capacity utilization rate declined 0.3 percentage
point in September, reversing the August increase. During the past year,
capacity utilization has slipped 1.5 percentage points; utilization in the
materials industries has dropped by 3.2 percentage points with durable
goods materials leading the way, declining by 5.3 percentage points.
Employment and Unemployment
Employment expanded at a moderate pace in the third quarter, but job
growth continued to be unbalanced across industries. In September, total
payroll employment rose 128,000, about one-half as much as the gains posted
in July and August. Employment continued to expand throughout most of the
private service sector in September, and hiring remained fairly brisk at
construction sites. However, manufacturing employment fell 110,000, bring-
ing the cumulative job loss since January to about 340,000. Manufacturing

job losses in September were concentrated in the durable goods industries,
particularly machinery and electrical equipment, which have accounted for
almost half of this year's reduction in factory employment. Job declines
in September also were reported in motor vehicles, but these partially
represented workers out on strike; in addition, there appeared to be
difficulties in seasonally adjusting auto employment data during the model
changeover period. Small declines were reported in most other manufacturing
industries. Despite the drop in manufacturing employment, the factory
workweek edged up further to 40.7 hours, its highest level in more than a
year.
In the household survey, recent job gains have been larger than those
reported in the payroll survey, reversing the pattern evident during the
first half of the year. In September, household employment was up 370,000
but was accompanied by an even larger increase in the labor force. As a
result, the civilian unemployment rate edged back up to 7.1 percent in
September after a drop of 0.3 percentage point in August.
Personal Income and Consumer Expenditures
Income growth this year has fallen well below its 1984 pace. Wage
and salary disbursements in the service sector have held up well, but manu-
facturing payrolls have been on a plateau, and there have been sizable
declines in farm and interest income. So far this year, real disposable
income has risen at an annual rate of only 0.7 percent.
In September, nominal personal income advanced just 0.3 percent
with the rise in private wages and salaries accounting for all of the
increase. The September income data showed a further decline in interest
income, a loss in farm income, and a drop in rental income that was associ-
ated with hurricane damage to residential properties.

Despite the slow growth of real income this year, consumer spending
remained brisk in the third quarter, primarily because of the surge in auto
purchases. Sales of domestically-produced cars were at a 11-1/4 million
unit annual rate in September and sales of imported cars rose to 3 million
units. However, in the first 20 days of October, the expected "payback" in
auto sales from the earlier response to interest and price discounts was
evident: sales of domestic units dropped to a 6.2 million unit annual rate.
Outlays for discretionary purchases other than cars generally have
been lackluster in recent months. Spending for furniture and appliances,
clothing, and "other durables" (including jewelry, recreational equipment
and other luxury items) was nearly unchanged during the third quarter.
This weakness in expenditures is consistent with the slowing that has occurred
in income growth. However, with overall spending boosted by the transitory
spurt in auto sales, the saving rate dropped further--to around 3 percent
in the third quarter.
The consumer surveys of the Michigan Survey Research Center and the
Conference Board both reported slight declines in their composite measures
of confidence because of a little more pessimism about the future; however,
favorable responses to questions about purchase plans for automobiles,
appliances, and homes moved higher last month to near-record levels. House-
holds responding to the survey continued to explain their buoyant buying
plans by citing price discounts and the availability of lower interest
rates--attitudes that may have been affected by the auto sales incentives
in place at the time.

Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment slumped in the third quarter. Although
quarterly growth rates have been erratic this year, on average, business
investment spending rose at only a 2-1/2 percent annual rate, compared to
the 16 percent gain posted in 1984.
Shipments of nondefense capital goods fell 4-1/2 percent in September,
and were flat for the third quarter as a whole. Excluding aircraft and
parts--much of which reflects exports and intermediate inputs rather than
domestic outlays for producers' durable equipment--third-quarter shipments
declined 1-3/4 percent. All other things equal, the September decline in
shipments would lead the Commerce Department to revise down its preliminary
estimate of a 3-1/2 percent (annual rate) drop in real third-quarter equip-
ment spending. In contrast to the weakness in shipments, business spending
for motor vehicles advanced sharply in the third quarter and, on balance,
have accounted virtually for all of the growth in equipment spending this
year.
Outlays for nonresidential structures also have softened in recent
months after sizable gains in the first half of the year. Although the
value of nonresidential construction put in place was up 1 percent in
August, this gain failed to offset the declines of the preceding three
months; real outlays for nonresidential structures fell at a 7-3/4
percent annual rate in the third quarter, with declines widespread.
Indicators of fixed investment point to sluggish spending in the near
term. New orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft and
parts, rose 1-3/4 percent in the third quarter, but are little changed
so far this year. While total equipment spending is likely to be

weak, spending for new computer equipment is expected to be boosted somewhat
in the fourth quarter as IBM begins to deliver its new mainframe computer.
For construction, the leveling off this year of new commitments suggests
that future spending growth will be limited.
The fall McGraw-Hill survey of capital spending plans indicated that
businesses expected to reduce their nominal outlays about 1 percent next
year. Declines in planned spending were especially pronounced in electrical
utilities, motor vehicles, and mining. Most other industries planned
slight increases in nominal spending for next year. Given the tendency of
the fall McGraw-Hill survey to underpredict spending during economic expansions,
actual capital spending may turn out to be somewhat stronger than is now
indicated. However, even when this error history is taken into account,
the survey results point to sluggish capital outlays.
Business Inventories
Recent data suggest that, with the exception of auto dealers, busi-
nesses generally have been keeping their stocks in line with sales. Inven-
tory investment by manufacturers and nonauto retailers has been minimal
since last spring. At the manufacturing level, constant-dollar inventories
declined at a $2 billion annual rate in August, returning to their level of
the first quarter of this year. With August shipments up slightly from the
first-quarter average, however, the inventory-sales ratio for manufacturing
was somewhat below the level that has prevailed through much of this year.
Excluding automobiles, retail inventories also were little changed in
August. In particular, the inventory position of department stores and
apparel outlets has not changed much in the past several months. Stocks at

these stores were about the same as in July, and only 0.4 percent higher than
the first-quarter level.
The surge in auto sales in late August and September depleted dealers'
stocks of 1985 models, and the carry-over of 1985 model inventories into
the fourth quarter was considerably less than usual. Although new car pro-
duction is scheduled to remain near third-quarter levels, sales are expected
to drop sharply in the fourth quarter, thus setting the stage for a sizable
buildup in dealers' stocks.
Housing Markets
Housing construction was weak in September, despite continued signs
that demand for owner-occupied homes generally has been on an uptrend
as the year has progressed. Total private housing starts fell 9-1/2 percent
in September, with declines registered in both the multifamily and the
single-family sectors. For the third quarter as a whole, housing starts
were off 6 percent. In contrast, newly-issued permits have been rising for
four consecutive quarters. To some extent, the relative strength in permits
is explained by a geographic shift in activity out of areas of the nation
that do not require building permits to permit-issuing regions.
In September, all regions showed reduced levels of starts activity,
but the largest declines were registered in the South and the West. None
of the regions has shown a marked expansion in building in response to the
decline in mortgage rates that has occurred since the spring. Moreover,
housing starts in the South seem to have been on a general downtrend since
early 1984. This weakness probably can be attributed to overbuilding during
the early 1980s boom as well as to difficulties in the energy and agriculture
sectors, on which several state economies in the region are dependent.

Nonetheless, other indicators of housing activity continue to suggest
that demand has picked up in the single-family market. Existing home sales
increased substantially in the third quarter, and new home sales continued to
improve. Moreover, the University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment
showed that homebuying attitudes rose to their highest level on record in
the quarter just ended. With sales of new homes up, and homebuilders
apparently remaining cautious in their production decisions, the rise in
stocks of unsold units have been brought to a halt in recent months, after
a steady accumulation for more than two years.
In the multifamily sector, starts were down 7-3/4 percent in Septem-
ber and 9-1/2 percent for the third quarter as a whole. These declines
followed a very strong second-quarter pace--the second highest building
rate in more than a decade--and brought activity more in line with underly-
ing market conditions. In the multifamily rental market, the rental vacancy
rate rose once again in the third quarter to 8.3 percent--the highest since
1967. Moreover, the market for condominiums and cooperatives has been
characterized by slow sales and a large stock of unsold units, reflecting
a heavy volume of completions coming to market from earlier starts.
Federal Sector
Federal purchases (NIPA basis) rose sharply in the third quarter. A
combination of high farm production and depressed agricultural prices led
to a substantial diversion of grain to government stockpiles, with real pur-
chases by the Commodity Credit Corporation jumping to more than $5 billion
at an annual rate. In addition, real spending on defense surged 20 percent
at an annual rate, following a 7 percent rise in the previous quarter.
Quarterly changes in defense purchases tend to be erratic, and spurts in

spending at the end of the fiscal year have occurred in the past. However,
the unusual strength over the past six months suggests that several problems
that inhibited defense payments earlier in the year may be abating. These
problems include delays in deliveries owing to poor quality control by con-
tractors and the controversy surrounding instances of overpricing of spare
parts and other items. In addition, a reversal of spending shortfalls from
earlier budget authority may be bolstering the current level of defense out-
lays.
On a unified budget basis, the federal deficit rose to a record $203
billion in fiscal 1985 ($212 billion including off-budget items). Unified
receipts reached $734 billion, $68 billion above the previous year. However,
spending totaled $937 billion, an increase of $95 billion. In addition to
strong outlay growth for defense and agricultural programs, interest outlays
were up substantially reflecting the additional stock of debt outstanding.
Also, the outlay total included a one-time $14 billion expenditure for
retirement of HUD-guaranteed housing project notes.
Congress must still pass a number of bills before the FY1986 budget
resolution targets are enacted and considerable uncertainty exists regarding
ultimate spending levels. Action on budget-related bills has been slowed
by the debate surrounding the debt ceiling and the Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget amendment. However, a reconciliation bill, which packages a number
of program changes aimed at meeting the resolution targets, was passed in
the House; a corresponding Senate bill has been reported to the floor.
There are considerable differences between the House and Senate bills, and
the administration has expressed reservations about a number of provisions.
Meanwhile, the thirteen FY1986 appropriation bills have moved along slowly--

only one bill has been sent to the President, and of the remaining twelve
bills, the House has passed ten, while the Senate has passed only six.
Here again, House and Senate versions of many bills contain significant
differences that need to be resolved in conference and eventually sent on
to the President.
State and Local Sector
State and local government real outlays for goods and services rose
at a 5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, following a 6.8 percent
increase during the spring. Real outlays for construction have advaned
rapidly so far this year, and during the first three quarters of this year
have averaged nearly 6 percent above their 1984 level. Increases in con-
struction have been concentrated in the renovation and building of educa-
tional facilities, streets and highways, and water and sewer systems.
Gains in state and local government receipts have not kept pace with
the exceptionally strong outlay growth. Although not all the data are
available, partial estimates indicate that in the third quarter the surplus
of the combined operating and capital accounts stood at its lowest level
since early 1983.
Wages and Labor Costs
Measures of wage inflation have been mixed recently and, on the
whole, continue to suggest no change in wage trends so far this year. The
employment cost index for wages and salaries increased 4-3/4 percent over
the past 12 months, up from 4.1 percent in 1984. The acceleration occurred
in the service-producing sector, where employment gains have been particu-
larly strong this year. At the same time, the hourly earnings index, a
less comprehensive measure covering only production and nonsupervisory

II-20
employees, has advanced at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent so far this year,
down from last year's rate and well below the pace of the employment cost
index. Since 1982, the employment cost index has consistently risen more
rapidly than the hourly earnings index, apparently because it includes the
larger wage increases that have been received by white-collar workers and
because it is corrected for shifts in the occupational distribution of
employment.
The moderate wage and salary increases in 1985 have been accompanied
by considerably slower rates of growth in employee benefit costs. The
rise in the employment cost index for total compensation of 4-3/4 percent
over the past twelve months was about the same as the increase in the
index for wages and salaries. This is the first time since 1981, when the
employment cost index began to include benefit data, that the growth of
fringe benefit costs has not exceeded wage growth. The recent moderation
of fringe benefits appears to be the result of efforts by employers to
negotiate lower-cost health insurance plans, as well as a decline in
contributions to pension plans, which became overfunded as financial assets
appreciated greatly in value during the last few years.
Wage adjustments reached in collective bargaining agreements this
year have continued to be restrained. First-year adjustments for 1.6
million of the 7 million workers in major bargaining units (those covering
1,000 or more employees) averaged 2.3 percent during the first nine months
of 1985, about equal to the record low reached during 1984. Overall union
wage inflation-which includes deferred increases and COLA payments as well
as initial adjustments--averaged 3.7 percent at an annual rate in the first
nine months of 1985, equal to its pace in 1984. Recently, the United Auto

II-21
Workers and Chrysler Corporation reached an agreement following the eight-
day strike. The agreement provides increases in wages of 2-1/4 percent in
the first year and a 2-1/4 percent lump sum payment in the second year,
bringing workers at Chrysler to wage parity with other U.S. autoworkers.
In addition, Chrysler workers will receive a 3 percent pay hike in
1987, when the rest of the industry will be negotiating a new contract.
The new Chrysler agreement also includes an immediate lump sum payment to
partially compensate for past wage and benefit concessions and retains a
generous COLA.
Despite the continued moderate growth in hourly compensation, unit
labor costs accelerated over the first three quarters of this year, as
the cyclical rebound in labor productivity waned. Output per hour in the
nonfarm business sector dropped sharply early in the year when production
decelerated markedly; it has risen at a 1-1/4 percent annual rate in the
past two quarters as labor demand has moderated and output growth has picked
up. The recent rise is in line with staff estimates of the current
trend in labor productivity.
Prices
Over the first three quarters of 1985, most aggregate measures of
inflation show some slowing from the rates posted in 1984, reflecting down-
ward pressures in the food and energy sectors as well as for a number of
other goods. In September, the consumer price index for all urban consumers
rose 0.2 percent for the fifth consecutive month, down somewhat from the
average monthly change earlier this year and during 1984. The producer
price index for finished goods fell 0.6 percent last month and has been
essentially flat since the beginning of the year.

For food, retail prices rose 0.3 percent in September, as prices of
meats turned up for the first time this year. Although prices at the farm
level were down in September, and have now fallen for nine consecutive
months, there probably will be a sharp rebound in farm prices in the October
PPI. Cattle prices in some markets have risen about 20 percent since
their mid-September low, and hog prices have advanced sharply. These
increases appear to be associated with a drop in meat production, as preli-
minary data for early October indicate that output has fallen below year-ago
levels. Because price declines for livestock earlier this year were not
fully passed on to consumers, there probably is room in the marketing sector
to absorb a large part of the recent price advances. The latest futures
prices for cattle and hogs suggest that cash prices will increase further
in the near term and then decline somewhat in the first half of 1986.
Energy prices edged down further in September at the retail level, as
a drop in pump prices of gasoline more than offset higher prices of home
heating oil. Stocks of distillate oil are lean, and, with the approach of
the heating season, spot prices of petroleum products have recovered notably
since midsummer.
Prices of other goods have been relatively flat, on balance, at the
producer and consumer levels after their sharp first-quarter increases. In
September, the consumer and capital equipment components of the PPI were
both down about 1/2 percent, essentially reflecting the effect on manufac-
turers' prices of incentive financing and price discount programs for

II-24
1985-model cars and trucks.1 In contrast to this year's pattern for goods,
the CPI for services other than energy, although slowing in September, has
been rising at a 5-1/2 percent rate so far this year, the same pace as
during 1984.
The moderation associated with food, energy, and other consumer goods
also was reflected in BEA's preliminary third-quarter estimates of their
fixed-weighted inflation measures.2 The fixed-weighted price index for
gross domestic business product slowed to a 2.6 percent annual rate, from
3.7 percent in the second quarter, owing to a swing in the energy component.
The GNP deflator shows a different pattern, accelerating to 3.3 percent in
the third quarter from 2.6 percent in the second quarter. This arose from
compositional shifts in demand, associated mainly with imports and business
fixed investment, which raised the third- and reduced the second-quarter
deflator.
1. The October PPI will reflect the higher prices of 1986-model cars and
trucks, adjusted for the estimated cost of quality changes, as well as the
effects of changes in financing arrangements and liquidation allowances.
The CPI is less affected by those factors, because auto financing is included
separately among private transportation services (with a small weight) and
the prices of new-model cars are phased in over several months in accordance
with sales.
2. The BEA indexes reflect changes in quarterly averages, in contrast to
the three-month changes shown in the CPI and PPI tables.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Growth in the monetary aggregates has abated in October to rates
well below those recorded in the third quarter. Averaging through volatile
week-to-week movements, M1 likely will be little changed this month from
its September level, while M2 probably will post only a small increase.
These developments would leave M1 still well above its second-half target
range but M2 just within its long-run range. The moderate growth projected
for M3 this month would hold it in the middle part of its 1985 range.
Money stock behavior apparently continues to have little impact on
market expectations; since the last FOMC meeting traders have focused
more on incoming economic news and have attempted to discern the implica-
tions of the September G-5 agreement for domestic and foreign economic
policies. Net movements in interest rates have been small, with private
short-term yields about unchanged and some easing in the long end of the
market.
Overall debt growth has been reduced a bit recently, in part by the
constraint on Treasury borrowing imposed by the federal debt ceiling.
The supply of short-term Treasury securities in the market has been aug-
mented, however, by official sales associated with intervention activity
to influence exchange rates, and any general impact of reduced federal
borrowing has been offset by the continued large budget deficit and
resultant rundown in Treasury cash balances at depository institutions.
Borrowing in the tax-exempt market meanwhile has remained heavy, especially
private purpose and advance refunding issues that would be barred after
year-end under the President's tax reform plan; tax-exempt rates, though
still high relative to other bond yields, have declined somewhat more in

recent weeks as market participants evidently have been attracted by the
perceived opportunity to reap capital gains when supply falls off early
in 1986.
In the private sector, corporate bond issuance has slackened in the
past couple of months and net short-term borrowing by nonfinancial firms
has been weak-despite continued heavy share retirements in connection
with mergers, takeovers, and stock repurchase programs. The basic needs
of nonfinancial corporations for external funding were reduced through
the third quarter by a runoff in inventories. In contrast, the surge in
auto sales likely buoyed consumer loan demand through September; available
evidence points to a substantial drop-off in installment borrowing this
month. Mortgage credit demands intensified during the summer, as home
sales surged, with especially strong flows through the mortgage-backed
securities market.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The growth of M1 tapered down to an 11-1/4 percent annual rate in
September and has been close to zero in October. The pattern of M1
growth over the last two months was affected by Hurricane Gloria. Reports
from the New York and Boston districts indicate that the hurricane-related
closings of businesses and banks on September 27, a Friday, left many
depositors unable to move funds out of demand accounts to make either
disbursements or investments. As a result, demand deposit figures were
inflated over the weekend, accounting for perhaps one-half of the 12-3/4
percent growth in such deposits during September and contributing 2 to 3
percentage points to M1 growth in that month. The subsequent unwinding
of these involuntary holdings then depressed M1 in October.

Growth of M1 in the third quarter at a 15 percent annual rate implies
an even faster decline in velocity than occurred in the first half of the
year. Historical patterns suggest that a factor pushing velocity lower
was the earlier drop in interest rates, which left most money market
rates in the third quarter at their lowest average levels in about seven
years. The velocity decline nevertheless was considerably greater than
that predicted by econometric models of money demand.
M2 growth slowed to a 7 percent annual rate in September and appears
to have eased further in October, reflecting decelerations both in its
nontransactions component and in M1. Growth of retail nontransactions
deposits remained sluggish in September; increases in savings deposits and
MMDAs were smaller than in July and August and the declines in small time
deposits were of lesser size. The rise in overnight RPs and Eurodollars
moderated in September, and M2-type money fund balances fell. In October,
the slower growth in M2 reflected primarily the lower figure for M1, but
the growth of the nontransactions component also declined because of a
runoff in overnight RPs and Eurodollars; the retail nontransactions
components strengthened with the growth again mainly in the more liquid
types of instruments.
The slightly faster growth of M3 in September stemmed from its non-M2
component, which rose at a 21 percent annual rate after essentially no change
in the preceding month. An important source of this increase was large time
deposits, as commercial banks boosted their issuance and thrift institutions
again became net issuers. The growth of managed liabilities has remained
strong in October, as banks' demands have been increased by the slower
growth of core deposits and the sharp decline in U.S. government deposits.

Bank credit expanded at an 8-3/4 percent annual rate in September,
above the August pace but still a bit below the growth rate in the first
half of the year. The bulk of a net increase in bank holdings of U.S.
government securities reflected a buildup in trading accounts at the be-
ginning of September. Growth in other securities remained strong, probably
representing continued large acquisitions of tax-exempt securities.
Total loans grew at about the subdued August pace. Real estate and
consumer loans both slowed in September from the double-digit rates that
had characterized much of the year to that point; the 8 percent rise in
consumer loans was the slowest in more than two years, and at least in
part reflected a diversion of new-car loans to auto finance companies in
response to promotional interest rates. By contrast, business loans picked
up a bit, although remaining sluggish, and the erratic security loan cate-
gory rebounded in September. Early data for large banks in October show
business loans declining and growth of consumer loans slowing further.
Business Finance
Overall business credit demand weakened in September and October:
short-term borrowing remained sluggish, and total bond volume was below its
elevated levels of the summer months despite record issuance in foreign
markets in October. Business loans at commercial banks and commercial
paper, taken together, declined slightly in September and grew at only
about a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Commercial paper
issuance by nonfinancial firms has picked up in October, but this probably
has been at least partially offset by a weakening in loans from commercial
banks. Short-term borrowing would have been even weaker recently were it
not for its use in financing merger activity.

Earlier in the summer, light short-term credit demands were associated
with heavy issuance of longer-term corporate bonds. In September and
early October, however, gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations
moderated, although relative to historical standards it could still be
viewed as substantial. The increase in corporate bond rates from their
summer lows may have discouraged firms from issuing long-term debt; by
early October, corporate bond rates had risen as much as 60 basis points
above their trough in July. In recent weeks they have edged down and
volume has picked up.
While bond volume by nonfinancial corporations decelerated, financial
firms remained active issuers in the bond market. A large portion of the
financial bond volume in recent months is attributable to strong growth
in collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Thrift institutions were
responsible for much of the third-quarter strength, while issuance by the
finance subsidiaries of residential builders surged in September and
October. By issuing CMOs, thrift institutions can raise funds by liquefying
their holdings of low interest rate mortgages without recording a capital
loss, and builders can receive cash for their home sales while maintaining
installment-sale tax benefits. Financial bond volume also has been boosted
recently by the finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers as they
fund low-rate loans made under their recent sales promotions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average set new records in mid-October,
after rising about 5-1/2 percent since late September. Other, more
broadly based, indexes also have shown gains, but remain below levels
reached in July. This discrepancy between the Dow and other indexes is
largely attributable to exceptional gains in the price of General Foods,

one of the 30 Dow industrials, which was boosted by a tender offer from
Philip Morris. The more general leveling in stock prices since the
summer has contributed to a slight falloff in new stock offerings. Gross
stock issuance averaged about $2-3/4 billion in September and October,
compared with monthly issuance of about $3-1/4 billion in the second and
third quarters. This gross issuance continues to be swamped by retirements
through mergers and other restructurings; indeed, it appears that gross
retirements this year may exceed the record volume of 1984.
U.S. Government Securities Market
The staff is projecting a combined (on- and off-budget) deficit of
$72-1/2 billion in the fourth quarter as a whole. The deficit will be
financed by a record amount of borrowing from the public, particularly
through marketable coupon issues. Progress to date in accomplishing the
needed financing has been inhibited by the delay in congressional approval
of an increase in the debt ceiling.
By the second week of October, the Treasury's cash balance was
exhausted, forcing it to utilize a complex transaction involving the
Federal Financing Bank and government trust funds in order to auction $5
billion of cash management bills. The Treasury could make further use of
this technique to raise an additional $5 to $10 billion of marketable
issues. The prospect of an extended delay in congressional action led
the Treasury to announce that it also will take the unusual step of
disinvesting government trust funds at the beginning of November.1 This
1. The Senate passed debt ceiling legislation, which was amended to include
balanced budget provisions--the Gramm-Rudman Balanced Budget Amendment--on
October 10. The House went directly into conference with the Senate on this
legislation because it had already passed a debt ceiling bill. Numerous
questions and differences of view about the amendment exist among conferees,
however. Thus, a time-consuming conference is likely and the final results
remain uncertain.

III-12
noncash paydown, which reduces government debt, provided room for the
Treasury to conduct this week its postponed end-of-quarter refunding,
which comprises $17-3/4 billion of coupon securities (maturities of 4, 7,
and 20 years) and represents all new cash. Assuming the debt ceiling is
raised in November, the Treasury soon thereafter will conduct its normal
midquarter refunding and probably also offer some cash management bills.1
Net borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies totaled $5.0
billion in the third quarter, about in line with the quarterly average
over the past year or so. Demand for Federal Home Loan Bank advances by
thrift institutions was strong, but the FHLBs met a good portion of this
demand by drawing down liquid assets. Borrowing by Fannie Mae moderated
in the third quarter; its gross purchases of mortgages have been maintained,
but it has been selling more mortgages from its portfolio in the form of pass-
through securities. Fannie Mae recently reported further income gains in the
third quarter, marking the second consecutive quarter of positive net income.
The Farm Credit Banks recorded a paydown in their outstanding debt
of about the same magnitude as in previous quarters, and paydowns have
continued into the current quarter. The System recently reported a net
loss of $522 million for the third quarter and $426 million for the first
nine months of the year. Net interest income again was positive, but it
1. The Treasury's compressed financing activity has generated questions
about possible interest rate pressures. However, with the fairly standard
pattern of Treasury auctions of coupon securities in recent years and a
general consensus on the total amount of funding over periods of a quarter
or two markets seem able to discount temporary distortions and seasonal
bulges in the supply of new issues. For example, last fall uctions of
7- and 20-year securities also were postponed because of de ceiling
problems and were part of a compressed Treasury financing schedule.
Interest rates were not subject to unusual pressure around the auction
date, and the revised Treasury schedule seemed to have little effect on
the downward trend in rates evident during this period.

III-13
was more than offset by provisions for loan losses and financial assistance
to Production Credit Associations, principally in the Omaha Farm Credit
District. Substantial further losses are likely if financial conditions
in agriculture deteriorate commensurate with current Department of Agricul-
ture price projections.
Spreads between the yields on Farm Credit securities and Treasuries
have edged up recently in conjunction with unfavorable news coverage. The
most recent 6-month issue of the Farm Credit Banks was sold at a spread
of 83 basis points over Treasury bills at the end of September but it is
expected that the next issue of 6-month Farm Credit securities at the end
of October may have a spread of about 100 basis points as many investors
may wish to run off their holdings of maturing securities. Yield spreads
for other agencies have widened a bit but by much less than for the Farm
Credit System. The Federal Home Loan Banks recently issued 1- and 3-year
securities with interest rates about 30 basis points above Treasury
securities of comparable maturities, a spread 10 to 15 basis points
greater than normal. The spreads on securities of the FHLBs widened
after reports that they may provide funding to a proposed corporation
established to acquire assets that the FSLIC had taken over from liqui-
dated institutions.
Tax-Exempt Securities Market
Gross issuance of tax-exempt bonds picked up in October from the
advanced $13 billion monthly average in the third quarter. The volume of
refunding bonds again was heavy, spurred by interest rate levels well
below those in previous years and the prospect that advance refundings
will be prohibited next year under tax-reform legislation. Large volumes

III-14
of new capital also were raised in October by other issuers anxious to
come to market before year-end. Apart from concerns about tax-reform
constraints on private-purpose financings, issuers of single-family
housing, industrial development, and student loan bonds each face state-
by-state annual volume caps. Unless interest rates increase sharply,
most of these issuers are expected to attempt to exhaust this year's tax-
exempt borrowing authority. Thus far, interest rate pressures reportedly
have been lessened by strong demand from investors who normally concentrate
their purchases in the taxable market; apparently, they anticipate
that a contraction in the supply of municipals after the end of this year
will boost the prices of tax-exempt securities, creating the potential for
capital gains.

3. Data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Among traditional municipal market investors, commercial banks have
been actively purchasing tax-exempt securities in the last two months and
are expected to continue to do so until year-end. An improved earnings
performance, with the associated demand for more tax shelters, has been

II-15
one factor leading to increased purchases by commercial banks. Potential
changes in the tax laws are another element. Under current tax provisions,
banks can deduct from their gross income 80 percent of the interest expenses
on liabilities that finance their acquisition of tax-exempt securities.
Under the Treasury's tax reform proposal, banks would lose this cost-of-
carry interest deduction on tax-exempt bonds purchased after the end of
this year.
Money market and other mutual funds also have purchased tax-exempt
securities actively this year. Total assets of tax-exempt money market
funds were $40 billion at mid-October, up from $24 billion at the end of
1984. These mutual funds purchase primarily variable-rate demand obli-
gations and large amounts of short-term tax and revenue anticipation note.
Mortgage Market
Mortgage lending appears to have picked up in recent months,
reflecting in part the sharply higher level of home sales. Savings and
loan associations are beginning to play a larger role in financing the
expansion of mortgage flows. Total mortgage assets of FSLIC-insured
thrift institutions expanded $8-1/2 billion in August, by far the largest
gain since the summer of 1984. This increase included a $3 billion net
addition of mortgage-backed securities to their portfolios, after net
sales totaling about $10 billion in the first seven months of the year.
Improved earnings and capital positions, as well as slow growth in the
first half of the year, allow institutions more latitude for growth in
the second half of the year under the FHLBB's new marginal net worth
requirements.

III-17
Issuance of pass-through securities was at a record pace in September.
Fannie Mae's pass-through sales have increased sharply from the levels
earlier in the year. A large portion of this issuance is in the form of
swaps with mortgage originators. In addition, Fannie Mae recently has
started selling more of its own mortgages by issuing pass-through securi-
ties, to assist in restructuring its portfolio.
Issuance of GNMA-guaranteed securities also has strengthened in
recent months, reflecting a shift toward FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed
loans. These federally underwritten mortgages have become particularly
attractive to home buyers seeking mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios,
because qualification standards for conventional loans have been tightened
and insurance premiums on such mortgages have been raised during recent
months. On the investor side of the GNMA market, mutual funds that
restrict their portfolios to government securities in general, or GNMA
securities predominantly, have grown rapidly in recent quarters, but they
still account for a small share of the total pass-through security market.
The large volume of pass-through issuance is consistent with a shift
toward fixed-rate mortgages, because ARMs still are a minor factor in the
mortgage-backed security market. FHLBB survey data show that in early
September adjustable-rate mortgages comprised only 48 percent of all con-
ventional home loans closed-near the smallest share of the past two years,
and down from 56 percent during the summer. This shift to fixed-rate
mortgages has occurred despite an initial-rate advantage on ARMs of about
250 basis points. Homebuyers appear to be gravitating to fixed-rate
mortgages because these instruments are available at rates near their
five-year lows and typically involve smaller mortgage insurance premiums
than ARMs with the same loan-to-value ratio.

Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit expanded at a 15 percent annual rate in
August, unchanged from July. Growth in the two months was off noticeably
from the roughly 20 percent annual rate experienced over the previous
1-1/2 years. Automobile loans expanded a bit more rapidly in August than
in July, with a strong increase in loans at finance companies more than
offsetting slower growth at commercial banks and credit unions. The
finance company share of loans outstanding was boosted by the reduced-
rate financing incentives offered on a broad range of 1985 models during
the last 10-day selling period of that month by all of the major manufac-
turers through their captive finance companies; the share held by commer-
cial banks dropped sharply as a result. Growth in revolving credit
picked up a bit in August to a 10.5 percent annual rate, but remained
well below the very rapid advances posted during the January-May period.
Preliminary data for commercial banks in September show a further
slowing in the growth of consumer installment loans. However, this
slowing likely reflects an additional shift of auto loans from banks to
finance companies.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted value of the dollar, shown in the upper panel
of the chart, has declined 2-3/4 percent further on balance since the
last FOMC meeting, bringing its net depreciation to 7-1/2 percent since
the G-5 announcement of September 22. As the chart's bottom panel
illustrates, since the G-5 announcement, the dollar has depreciated most
against the yen, which market participants correctly perceive to be the
focus of G-5 concern. The dollar has declined nearly 12 percent against
the yen, but only 8 percent vis-a-vis the mark and 5 percent in terms of
sterling.
The dollar's weighted value fell nearly 2-1/2 percent during the
first week of October, as market participants remained concerned about
potentially forceful central bank sales of dollars and looked to the
IMF/World Bank meetings in Seoul for further announcements by G-5
officials. The dollar firmed somewhat when reports from Seoul suggested
that G-5 authorities were satisfied with the dollar's level and that no
significant policy changes to back up the intervention effort were
imminent.
The dollar subsequently traded in a narrow range.
.Data on the U.S. economy, meanwhile,
presented a slightly weaker picture than the market reportedly expected.
The dollar's steadiness in the face of these influences was consistent
with dealer reports of strong commercial and investment demand for
dollars, particularly from Japanese investors.

Near the end of the intermeeting period, the dollar began again to
weaken, declining initially versus the yen when the Bank of Japan
indicated that in the context of efforts to support the yen, it would
not be appropriate for the Bank to accommodate the season's strong
demands for liquidity as it usually does. Interest rates on yen
money-market instruments responded with sharp increases, and yen bond
yields rose steeply as well, even though Japanese officials denied they
were changing policy or trying to guide interest rates permanently
higher. The dollar's falloff broadened to include the other major
currencies in association with some increase in interest rates in German
and British credit markets and declines in U.S. interest rates. In the
context of the Bank of Japan's actions, market participants conjectured
that G-5 authorities might be embarking on a coordinated effort to
narrow U.S.-foreign interest-rate differentials in a "second phase" of
the program to depress the value of the dollar.

IV-4
U.S. International Financial Transactions
U.S. corporations continued to raise substantial amounts in the
Eurobond markets in September and the first half of October. While
foreign currency and dual currency issues were still appearing, they
were down from the August peak. FNMA issued dual currency (yen-dollar)
bonds in the Euromarket and Y30 billion (about $140 million) in bonds in
the U.S. domestic market, the first fixed-rate foreign-currency
denominated bond to be issued in the domestic market by a U.S. borrower.
The resulting foreign currency exposure for FNMA was eliminated through
swaps. The minimum denomination for the domestic issue was 1 million
yen (about $4600), in contrast to the much larger minimum denominations
of certain other recent foreign currency issues that were clearly

IV-5
targeted at U.S. institutional investors.
Also of note was the $500 million floating rate Euronote issued in
October by Citicorp, priced at 0.225 percent over one-month LIBID.
Despite its large size, it apparently sold well, indicating that certain
U.S. banks continue to be able to raise large sums in the Euromarkets.
The 25 largest U.S. banks have raised almost $8 billion through the
issue of Eurobonds in the first 10 months of 1985. In contrast,
U.S.-based banks have reduced somewhat the CDs outstanding at their
London branches.
Turning now to the Summary Table of U.S. International
Transactions, the net capital inflows corresponding to the large U.S.
current account deficit are not apparent in the data currently available
for August. Inflows of official capital were small (lines 4 and 5) and
net private securities transactions (line 2) were less than $2 billion.
Private foreigners sold over $3 billion dollars net of U.S. Treasury
securities in August (line 3). This was more than accounted for by the
World Bank, which shifted the composition but not the overall size of
its dollar portfolio. The sale of almost $4.5 billion in Treasury and
Agency securities by the IBRD was accompanied by about a $2.5 billion
increase in IBRD deposits at banks in the United States (mostly IBFs),
accounting for the bulk of the $3 billion bank-reported inflow (line 1).

The published merchandise trade deficit was smaller in August
than in July, and for the two-month period on average it was $110
billion, SAAR, substantially smaller than the deficit recorded in the
second quarter; most of the change was in imports. These data,
however, need to be assessed with an extra amount of caution.
Preliminary calculations of revisions anticipated in the monthly
trade data suggest that the level of merchandise imports for July will
end up being much larger than the currently published figures imply;
revisions for August data will be available with the release of
September trade figures on October 31.
The revisions involve recompiling trade data beginning in 1983 to
reflect the actual month of entry for imports and the month of
shipment for exports. In currently published data the carry-over of
documents received too late for inclusion in the appropriate
statistical month has become very large and varies in size from
month-to-month. Current practice calls for late documents to be just
added to the current month's figures. For the August data, this
carry-over amounted to 47 percent of the value of imports and 11
percent of the value of exports. The size of the revisions
anticipated suggest that at some point there will be a significant
revision in the quarterly pattern of net trade in the GNP account and
in the international transactions account. A rough estimate of a
revised trade balance is shown in the table below. The corrections to
the data tend to eliminate some, but not all, of the wide variability
in the reported monthly export and import figures.

1/ International transactions and GNP basis. Monthly data are estimated.
Published data for total imports in July and August were
notably lower than imports in the previous several months. Large
declines from second-quarter levels were reported for industrial
supplies (particularly steel), machinery (especially business
machines), aircraft, durable consumer goods, and trucks and automotive
parts from Canada. In addition, the value of oil imports fell by 13
percent. The decline in oil imports was in both volume and price.
See the table below. Taking a somewhat longer perspective, the value

IV-10
of total imports for the first 8 months of 1985 was 2 1/2 percent higher
than for the same period a year ago; at the same time import prices on
average declined nearly 5 percent.

Exports in July-August were little changed from the
second-quarter rate. A decline in exports of agricultural products
and machinery was largely offset by an increase in aircraft exports.
The value of exports in July-August was 5 percent lower than the level
recorded a year earlier despite a small increase in export prices and
continued growth of economic activity abroad. An important factor in
this weakness in exports is the continuing lagged effects of the
dollar's sharp appreciation through early 1985.

IV-11
Foreign Economic Developments. Economic growth has been moderate but
uneven in the major foreign industrial countries. The trade weighted
average of industrial production for the major six foreign industrial
countries rose 1.6 percent (s.a.) in July above its level in the second
quarter; this is 3.2 percent above what it was in July 1984. Industrial
production fell in Japan in August and September. In August, industrial
production fell in Germany, and it was roughly unchanged in the United
Kingdom and Italy. Inflation abroad continues to be moderate, with most
countries experiencing gains in the recent data. The balance of trade
continues to be in surplus in Japan, Germany, and Canada. Italy saw a
strong improvement in its trade balance in the most recent data, while
in the United Kingdom and France the trade balance deteriorated
slightly.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, recent data suggest a continued
slowing of the rate of economic growth. Japanese industrial production
fell 1.3 percent (s.a.) in August and 1.1 percent (s.a.) in September to
a level 3.5 percent above what it had been a year earlier. Retail sales
declined by 1.4 percent (s.a.) in August, but new housing starts rose in
September after having declined in the five previous months.
The Tokyo consumer price index rose 2.7 percent during the 12
months ending in October, up 0.5 percent from the equivalent rate
recorded in September. Japan's external surpluses continued at record
rates. For the first eight months of 1985, the cumulative trade surplus
was $51 billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with $44 billion for all of 1984.

IV-15
During the same period, the cumulative current account surplus was $44
billion (s.a.a.r.), while it was $35 billion in 1984.
In an effort to blunt growing protectionist pressure and in light
of commitments made during the G-5 meeting on September 22, Prime
Minister Nakasone announced on October 15 a package of measures designed
to stimulate domestic demand. These measures seek to encourage domestic
investment by promoting plant and equipment purchases, housing and real
estate development, local government borrowing for public works, and
consumer borrowing. The government estimates that these measures will
increase Japan's gross national product next year by 1-1/4 percent and
that they will generate a $2 billion increase in Japanese imports over
the next twelve months. These official estimates are probably too
optimistic, since the measures cited fail to include substantial fiscal
stimulation. Tax reform proposals are currently being studied for
fiscal year 1986, but preliminary indications are that any tax measures
will be revenue neutral.
Industrial production in Germany fell in August, but the two month
average for July and August was 2.4 percent above that of the second
quarter and 4 percent above the average of July and August of 1984.
Survey information on business conditions and order volume data,
covering both domestic and foreign goods, suggest some improvement in
outlook. The Bundesbank reports continued advances in corporate profits
this year and increased purchases of machinery and equipment, especially
in the investment goods sector. The level and the rate of unemployment
fell slightly in September.

IV-16
The consumer price index has barely moved between March and
October. The year-over-year rate of increase was 2 percent in October,
with falling import prices contributing to the stability in consumer
prices. In addition, wage increases have been low and unit costs have
been flat so far this year.
The cumulative current account surplus through September was $7
billion (n.s.a.), while it was roughly in balance for the same period of
last year. This improvement is entirely the result of the increase in
the trade surplus.
A tax cut of about DM 11 billion, equivalent to 0.7 percent of
nominal GNP, will become effective at the beginning of 1986. The
government has so far withstood considerable pressure to reduce taxes by
an additional DM 10 billion. Further tax reductions are planned for
fiscal year 1988.
The index of industrial production in the United Kingdom rose 0.5
percent (s.a.) in August, after having fallen during the previous two
months. When adjusted for unusually low oil production, the level of
industrial production appears unchanged during the summer. Real
consumption, however, rose 3.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter,
indicating continued moderate GDP growth.
The sharp acceleration in U.K. price inflation that took place in
the spring now appears to have abated. Retail prices were flat between
June and September, and the twelve-month inflation rate in September
declined to 5.9 percent. The U.K. trade deficit was $2.5 billion
(s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter. The cumulative trade deficit for the

IV-17
first three quarters of 1985 was $3.2 billion (s.a.a.r.) and the
cumulative current account surplus during the same period was $2.7
billion (s.a.a.r.). The trade deficit in 1984 was $5.7 billion.
The year-over-year growth of £M3 in September exceeded 14 percent,
well above its 5 to 9 percent target rate. Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson stated on October 17 that the government is prepared to
tolerate such growth during the 1985/86 fiscal year because other
indicators suggest that monetary conditions are not untowardly loose.
The government, however, has not abandoned £M3 as a monetary policy
target and will set a £M3 target next year. Chancellor Lawson announced
that the government was renouncing the technique of overfunding as a
means of controlling the money supply. Overfunding takes place when the
Bank of England sells more long-term government debt than is needed for
the government's budget requirements, typically offsetting the effect of
these additional debt sales on market liquidity through the purchase of
commercial bills. Lawson said further that Bank of England will instead
rely on short-term interest rates to control monetary conditions. This
statement has been widely interpreted as being consistent with a policy
of continued high interest rates.
Economic activity in France has strengthened slightly in recent
months. After declining in June, industrial production rose to an
average level for July and August that was 2.5 percent (s.a.) above that
for the second quarter. The September survey of manufacturers shows
increased production, and the unemployment rate in September declined to
10.4 percent (s.a.), the lowest in ten months.

IV-18
French consumer prices increased only 0.1 percent in September, the
same increase as in August. The rate of inflation over the preceding
twelve months was 5.3 percent, down about 1 percent since the start of
the year. This decline is attributable in part to lower import prices.
Inflation is thus only slightly above the government's revised target of
5 percent by the end of this year.
The balance of trade was in deficit in September after having been
in balance in August. Imports rose more quickly in value than exports
in September, resulting in a deficit of $0.3 billion (s.a.). Through
September the cumulative trade deficit was $2.9 billion (s.a.a.r.),
slightly above the $2.7 billion deficit recorded in all of 1984.
Gross domestic product in Canada increased 1 percent in July
bringing the twelve-month increase to 3.8 percent. Automobile and
automobile parts accounted for much of the rise in GDP. Industrial
production increased 1.9 percent (s.a.) in July, owing to a large
increase in manufacturing output. The unemployment rate fell a further
0.2 percent to 10.1 percent in September. The unemployment rate has
declined 1.1 percent since January.
Inflation remains moderate in Canada. Consumer prices increased
0.2 percent in September, bringing the twelve-month inflation rate to
4.1 percent, slightly higher than in August. The wholesale price index
declined in August, leaving wholesale prices only 2.1 percent above
year-earlier levels. Meanwhile, Canada's trade surplus increased in
August after a sharp decline in July. The cumulative surplus during the

IV-19
first eight months of this year was $12.5 billion (s.a.a.r.), compared
with $15.9 billion during all of 1984.
On September 30, the Government of Canada announced the closure of
Northland Bank after attempts to save it had failed. The government
also appointed a Supreme Court Justice to conduct an inquiry into the
events leading to the liquidation of Canadian Commercial Bank and that
of Northland Bank, which had occurred on September 1. In the wake of
these failures, Mercantile Bank of Canada, the country's eighth largest
bank, has faced increasing liquidity problems. The National Bank of
Canada announced that it is willing to take over Mercantile Bank. Even
though there are rumors that Continental Bank and Bank of British
Columbia are also experiencing liquidity problems, concern about the
stability of the Canadian banking system as a whole has moderated.
Industrial production in Italy in July and August was 1.5 percent
(s.a.) below its average in the second quarter. This is 0.6 percent
(s.a.) below its level in July and August of last year, and Italy's
industrial production is still below the peak achieved at the beginning
of 1982.
The twelve-month rate of inflation as measured by the consumer
price index in September was 8.3 percent (n.s.a.), the lowest such
figure in more than a decade. The wholesale price index in August was
6.9 percent (n.s.a.) above its level of a year earlier.
The trade account improved in July and August. The trade deficit
was $0.3 billion (s.a.) as compared with $1.3 billion (s.a.) during July
and August 1984.

IV-20
Prime Minister Craxi's government fell on October 17, in the wake
of the hijacking of the Achille Lauro and the subsequent decision to
release Abu Abbas. The Republican Party withdrew from Craxi's
coalition, and Finance Minister Visentini, who was responsible for
significant tax reforms aimed at lowering Italy's chronic deficit, left
the government as a result. On October 21, President Cossiga asked
Craxi to form a new coalition, and it is still too early to judge the
effect that a new government will have on Italy's economic policies.

IV-21
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries. Argentina was
found in compliance with the end-July IMF performance tests, but some
difficulties may arise with the end-September tests. Real activity has
continued to expand in Brazil, but negotiations between Brazil and the
IMF remain stalled. Mexico is out of compliance with its IMF program,
but following the earthquakes, it will receive up to $800 million in
emergency assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and the
Inter-American Development Bank. Venezuela has made progress in
registering its private external debt, but the signing of its
rescheduling agreement has been further delayed by disputes over the
documentation. The Peruvian government has refused to receive a routine
IMF mission and has suggested the possibility that Peru will withdraw
from the IMF. The Philippines has not yet met the qualitative program
targets for the second IMF program review, but the IMF will probably
accept the policy actions proposed by the Philippine government. When
the review is completed the third tranche of the IMF loan and the second
disbursement of the country's new money facility will become available.
Individual Country Notes. Argentina was found in compliance with
the end-July IMF performance tests. This triggered the disbursement on
September 30 of SDR 235 million from the IMF and $2.2 billion from the
new $4.2 billion commercial bank loan. On the same date Argentina
completed the repayment of the 12-country bridge loan obtained last
June, paid the overdue $750 million balance of the 1982 commercial bank
bridge loan, brought interest on public sector debt to banks current up
to early September, and made payments on certain other arrears.
Compliance with the end-September IMF performance tests is still being

IV-22
assessed, but there are indications that some deviations may have
occurred. In September, inflation continued to decelerate with consumer
prices rising by only 2 percent. The average monthly yield on 30-day
unregulated deposits at private banks declined about 140 basis points
from mid-September to mid-October. Factors contributing to this
included a 600 basis-point decline in the rate on central bank paper
that banks must hold against these deposits, reduction in the reserve
requirements against unregulated deposits, and an increase in the volume
of such deposits that the banks may accept. On September 24, the
Argentine Congress completed action on the forced savings plan that is
projected to augment public sector revenues by about 0.6 percent of GDP.
The need to accumulate austral balances in order to begin payments into
the forced savings plan contributed to an appreciation of the austral in
the parallel exchange market. In mid-October, the spread between the
parallel and official exchange rates was about 12.5 percent, compared
with around 17 percent in mid-September.
Following the September earthquakes, Mexico obtained a six-month
postponement of a $950 million prepayment on its 1983 bank loan, which
it had promised to make during the fourth quarter under the multi-year
debt restructuring agreement signed earlier this year. Emergency
assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and the Inter-American
Development Bank totaling up to $800 million will more than cover the
impact of the earthquakes on the 1985 current account, which has been
estimated at about $700 million. In effect, the earthquakes have handed
Mexico an international reserve cushion at a time when it was facing a
persistent outflow of capital and the loss of about $900 million in IMF

IV-23
drawings because of deviations from the IMF program's performance tests.
For 1986, the Mexican authorities are seeking gross financing to cover a
projected current account deficit of $1 billion, and a $2-3/4 billion
rebuilding of reserves. Commercial banks are being asked to provide
$2-3/4 billion-$2.5 billion on a net basis. Mexico and the IMF have
begun discussions on a new stand-by arrangement.
Effective October 1, Mexican Treasury bill rates, which had been
market determined for nearly three years, began to be announced before
each auction. By this action, the authorities hoped to lower the
Treasury bill rate in order to reduce the cost of servicing the domestic
debt, which, this year, is exceeding original projections by the
equivalent of 2-1/2 percent of GDP, owing to an unanticipated rise in
domestic interest rates. Initial auctions under the new system have
resulted in replacing only about one third of the amount of maturing
bills. The Bank of Mexico absorbed part of the difference and the rest
was redeemed. Such an approach cannot long be continued without
bringing about an upsurge of inflation and capital flight.
In Brazil, real economic activity has continued to recover in 1985.
Industrial production for the first eight months was about 7 percent
higher than a year earlier, reflecting rapid growth of domestic demand.
The external trade surplus has continued at a $12 billion annual rate,
an amount sufficient to finance interest obligations and other external
service payments without access to new bank financing. Inflationary
forces gathered strength during the third quarter--the fiscal deficit
exceeded expectations and growth of the monetary base accelerated,
showing a 17 percent increase in September. The impasse continues

IV-24
between the Brazilian government and the IMF management over negotiation
of a lower fiscal deficit for 1986 and a credible plan for deceleration
of inflation.
Peru's new government has taken further measures in an attempt to
restrict imports, stimulate production, and at the same time contain
inflation. In early October, a ban was announced on imports of some 500
products, along with removal of the value-added tax on basic necessities.
Interest rates were reduced for the third time since the new government
took office at the end of July, wages were increased for the second
time, and the price freeze was broadened to cover gasoline and utilities.
In his speech to the U.N. General Assembly, President Garcia raised the
possibility that Peru will withdraw from the IMF. The government has
refused to receive a routine IMF mission, and is now in arrears to the
Fund. Interest arrears on the public sector's debt to banks are now
about $375 million and some exceed one year.
The Venezuelan multi-year rescheduling agreement is tied up in
disputes over the documentation. The Venezuelans have requested the
inclusion of a clause in the agreement that would allow the terms to be
reconsidered if unforeseen circumstances cause them to be unable to meet
payments. Problems with the registration of private sector debt, which
previously held up the signing, are nearly resolved. The Venezuelan
government hopes the agreement will be signed by the end of the year.
On October 7, the Philippines obtained from its creditor banks the
eighth extension of a 90-day moratorium on the repayment of principal on
non-trade external debt to banks. While the Philippines is still out of
compliance with its IMF program, it appears that Fund management is

IV-25
close to accepting the policy changes proposed by the Philippine
