The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity appears to be expanding at a moderate pace in
the current quarter, although probably less rapidly than the upwardly-
revised 4.3 percent annual rate of increase in real GNP reported for
the third quarter. In particular, labor market data showed continued
expansion in October and November. Prices increased faster in October
than in previous months, but the pickup does not appear to represent a
fundamental acceleration in the pace of inflation.
Employment
Gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged 270,000 in October and
November, equal to the third-quarter pace. Much of the employment growth
occurred in the services and finance industries, where hiring has expanded
at a healthy pace this year. However, manufacturing employment also
rose, increasing by almost 75,000 jobs, strike-adjusted, in October and
November, the first two-month gain since the end of 1984. In addition,
the factory workweek remained at a high level.
In the household survey, employment gains averaged just under
200,000 in October and November. The civilian unemployment rate, which
has held fairly steady since August, edged down in November to 7.0
percent.
Information on industrial production in November is scheduled for
release on December 13 and will be discussed in the Greenbook Supplement.

Personal Consumption Expenditure and Income
Personal consumption expenditures fell almost 1 percent in October
(not at an annual rate). Sharply lower auto sales more than accounted
for this decline, as finance and price concessions on 1985 models ended.
Demand for domestic cars remained sluggish in November, with sales at
only a 6.4 million unit annual rate. Auto production has substantially
outpaced sales during the past two months, and a sizable inventory
accumulation has occurred. As a result, domestic auto makers have
announced incentive programs on selected models in an effort to trim
stocks. However, the incentives are not as widespread as those in August
and September and probably will have only a limited impact on purchases.
Sales of foreign cars in November remained strong at a 3.3 million unit
annual rate.
Excluding autos, the increase in personal consumption expenditures
in October outpaced income growth, as it has for much of the year. As
a result of strong household spending, the personal saving rate has fallen
from 6.2 percent at the end of 1984 to 3.0 percent in October. Relative
to last year, growth in labor income has slowed, particularly in the
manufacturing sector; moreover, nonlabor income has been flat this year,
as farm income has plunged and interest income has edged down. Part of
the drop in the saving rate may reflect the tendency for consumption to
show a damped response in the short run to the volatile swings in farm
income.

Moreover, the NIPA definition of personal income excludes capital gains,
which have been substantial in 1985 as a result of the rally in stock and
bond markets.
Business Fixed Investment
Investment spending in the aggregate remains sluggish, following a
real decline of 3.7 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter. In the
equipment category, a decline in auto purchases in the current quarter is
expected to offset a rise in shipments of nondefense capital goods. In
October, shipments of nondefense capital goods increased 4-1/2 percent to a
level 2-3/4 percent above the third-quarter average. The pickup was widespread,
with electrical machinery showing the largest increase among the major
components.
Shipments of office and computing equipment were up 1-1/2 percent
in October. However, there is uncertainty as to how much of the expected
increase in deliveries of IBM Sierra mainframe computers took place in
that month. Regardless of Sierra, the recent data on computer orders
and shipments is indicative of general sluggishness in the industry.
Outlays for nonresidential structures have shown little change in
recent months. The value of nonresidential construction put in place
declined 0.9 percent in October, offsetting a 1 percent advance in September.
For all major categories of structures except institutional buildings, the
October level of spending is below the peaks reached last spring.
Indicators of fixed investment point to sluggish spending in the
near term. New orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft
and parts, fell 5-1/2 percent in October, but on balance the behavior of

bookings during the past few months appears to be an extension of the
generally flat pattern evident since mid-1984. For nonresidential
construction, outlays from existing projects likely will continue to rise
in the near term, but this year's leveling off of new commitments suggests
that spending growth in 1986 will be limited.
The Merrill Lynch survey of capital spending plans, conducted in
late August and September, indicated that businesses expect to increase
nominal outlays 3 percent next year. These figures are somewhat stronger
than the spending plans reported earlier in McGraw-Hill's fall survey,
which showed a 1 percent decline. On average, both surveys tend to under-
predict spending during economic expansions; adjusting for these systematic
biases, the surveys are broadly consistent with flat real capital spending
in 1986.
Housing Markets
The pace of new residential construction picked up in October, as
total private housing starts rose 11 percent to a 1.76 million unit annual
rate. Starts of single-family houses jumped in October to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.1 million units, the highest level since April.
Existing home sales edged up in October to a 3.49 million unit annual rate,
almost 4 percent above the average pace in the third quarter; new home
sales, however, posted a disappointing drop.
In the multifamily sector, starts were up 3 percent in October, but
remained in the somewhat reduced range registered in the third quarter.
With markets for both rental units and condominiums characterized by excess
supply, activity in this sector has continued to be supported by record

volume of below-market financing provided through state and local government
tax-free bonds. Issuance of such securities has been averaging just over
$10 billion at an annual rate through the first 11 months of 1985. This
was well above last year's pace and double the previous high seen in 1982.
Should a new tax bill be passed, authority for such financing likely will
be reduced, if not eliminated. Anticipation of such a curtailment probably
accounts for the heavy issuance of these securities in recent months.
Business Inventories
Inventory investment, on balance, continued to reflect a cautious
stance on the part of most businesses. In September, stocks in all manu-
facturing and trade rose at an annual rate of $4.2 billion in real terms,
following an average accumulation of $3.2 billion in the preceding three
months, and the nonauto inventory-sales ratio, while up slightly in Sep-
tember, remained well within the range set over the past year.
In October, the book value of manufacturing inventories fell by
$23.5 billion at an annual rate. Stocks of finished goods declined $8.3
billion, as manufacturers evidently stepped up shipments faster than
production. In addition, inventories at earlier stages of processing
were reduced, partly in response to weakness in orders. Overall, the ratio
of inventories to sales in the manufacturing sector fell to 1.43, its
lowest level in 18 months.
In the trade sector, real nonauto inventories rose $7.6 billion at
an annual rate in September--about the same pace as in July and August.
Although general merchandise stores and apparel dealers did report rela-
tively large accumulations in August and September, there is little

indication of the widespread overstocking at trade establishments that
was evident at this time last year.
One major exception to the generally lean inventory picture is the
domestic automobile sector. After sharp drawdowns in late August and
September, auto dealers' stocks of domestic cars rose substantially in
October and November. Dealer inventories now are at about the level
that prevailed in the summer before sales and financing discounts became
widespread.
Federal Sector
Real federal government purchases rose rapidly in the third quarter.
Abundant harvests and depressed farm prices apparently added a large
quantity of grain to government stockpiles. The latest figures show real
CCC purchases were $6 billion at an annual rate last quarter and qualitita-
tive reports suggest that spending this quarter will continue to be high.
In the third quarter, real defense purchases climbed sharply; and for the
six-month period beginning in April such spending rose at a 16 percent
annual rate. Furthermore, budget outlays for national defense in October
point to a continuation of high levels of spending in the fourth quarter.
The surge in real defense purchases in the second and third quarters
took place in all major spending categories. Sizable real expenditure
increases were registered for construction, research and development, and
other types of services. The military equipment grouping, which includes
aircraft, missiles, ships, electronics, vehicles, and other military
hardware, accounted for nearly half of the rise.

1. Figures are the request in the administration's budget published the
January before the fiscal year began. For 1982, the Reagan proposal is
shown. The Carter budget request was $200.3 billion.
2. The difference in level between NIA purchases and budget outlays
reflects primarily the treatment of military retirement contributions and
payments. The outlay figures include the retirement contributions, while
the NIA data do not. After the revision of NIA data later this month,
defense purchases will include military retirement contributions. As a
result, the difference in levels between budget outlays and purchases
will narrow. Other differences in the budget and NIA concepts result
from the treatment of the timing of certain payments; however, timing
differences tend to be more important for interpreting quarterly data.
n.a.-Not available.
*As estimated in the Congressional Budget Resolution passed August 1,
1985. Final action on FY1986 appropriations has not been completed.

II-14
Although quarterly NIA figures tend to be volatile, several factors
indicate that defense spending in the near term can be maintained at the
high levels of recent quarters. For example, unfilled orders for defense
capital goods at manufacturers have continued to trend up; at the end of
October the backlog of orders was nearly 15 percent above a year earlier.
More fundamentally, as shown in the table, appropriations have risen sharp-
ly in recent years, even though they were scaled back from administration
requests. Outlay increases, however, have lagged appropriations as may be
seen in the lower panel of the chart.
Part of the lag in outlays is due to a shift in the mix of spending
to areas with long lead times: equipment spending has risen to 31 percent
of total defense purchases compared with 25 percent in 1977, and outlays
increasingly have reflected obligations incurred over several years.
Indeed, the proportion of FY1986 spending resulting from prior year con-
tracts and obligations is expected to be nearly 40 percent of the total; in
1977, only 19 percent of national defense outlays were from budget authority
in previous years. Quality control problems and reports of over-pricing by
defense contractors may have contributed to some delay in expenditures, and
such controversies continue to be a source of uncertainty for the rate of
spending.
Congressional action on the FY1986 budget continues to be slow,
owing in part to the debate concerning a permanent increase in the debt
ceiling and the Gramm-Rudman amendment. At present, three of the
thirteen appropriation bills have been enacted, and a fourth was vetoed
by the President. Further action remains on the nine other bills. Meanwhile,
a continuing resolution, which expires on December 12, is providing temporary

II-15
FY1986 funding. A related budget measure, the reconciliation bill that
would enact many of the savings contained in the FY1986 budget resolution
passed last August, is in conference.
State and Local Sector
Recent data on balance suggest a tapering off of growth in real
outlays of state and local governments following two quarters of vigo-
rous increases. Although employment figures show continued growth,
real construction put-in-place in October actually was down a bit from
its third quarter level, following two quarters of exceptionally strong
gains in construction activity.
Some slowing in overall spending is to be expected in light of
budgetary developments in the state and local sector. The sector as a
whole reported a $3 billion surplus in its combined operating and
capital account (excluding social insurance trust funds) in the third
quarter, its smallest surplus since the deficits associated with
the 1981-82 recession. Nearly half the states ended their fiscal year
(in June) with only a slight surplus or a deficit. As a result, with
requirements to balance general funds budgets nearly universal, several
states have instituted program cutbacks or hiring freezes.
Wages and Labor Costs
Measures of wage inflation have continued to be mixed in recent
months, with the low rates of wage growth reported in the hourly earnings
index at odds with the somewhat higher rates reported in the employment
cost index. However, on the whole, wage inflation appears to have
leveled off this year, after decelerating sharply in 1983 and 1984.

II-16
The hourly earnings index, which measures wages of production
and nonsupervisory workers, rose 0.3 percent in November to a level only
0.6 percent above the third-quarter average. Wage increases in all
major industries have been quite moderate in recent months. So far
this year, this measure of wage inflation has risen 2.9 percent,
about the same increase posted over the course of 1984.
An alternative measure, the employment cost index, has risen by
4.8 percent over the first three quarters of 1985, probably reflecting
larger increases for its more broadly-based sample of white-collar
workers.
Revised data also indicate that productivity in the nonfarm
business sector rose 2.1 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.
However, over the first three quarters of 1985 combined, productivity shows
little change, and unit labor costs have risen at a 4 percent annual rate
over this period. Costs rose more slowly earlier in the recovery, when
output was increasing rapidly and productivity gains were higher.
Prices
Measures of price inflation were higher in October than in previous
months, reflecting developments in the automobile and farm sectors. The
consumer price index for all urban consumers rose 0.3 percent, similar to
its average pace so far this year but above the low 0.2 percent monthly
rate that prevailed from May through September. The producer price index
for finished goods jumped 0.9 percent in October, reversing its August
and September declines.

Food prices accounted for about one third of the rise in the producer
price index for finished goods. This was due to a sharp rebound in meat
prices, reflecting a tightening of livestock supplies, which also was
responsible for the 6-1/4 percent rise in crude food prices. With cattle
prices still on the rise in recent weeks and crop prices rebounding a bit
from the depressed levels of early autumn, crude food prices probably will
register a further substantial increase in November. At the consumer
level, meat prices also rose markedly in October, but price declines in
other categories held the overall increase for food to .2 percent.
The October price reports also reflected auto-related developments.
The CPI less food and energy items was up 0.5 percent, after an unusually
small September increase of 0.2 percent. In October, higher prices on 1986-
model cars and the ending of many financing concessions boosted both the
commodity and service categories. Price increases for cars and trucks had
an even sharper impact on the PPI for finished goods less food and energy,
essentially accounting for the swing from a decline in September to an 0.8
percent increase in October. Because the PPI reflects the prices charged
(received) by manufacturers, net of discounting of any kind, the October
increase picked up the change from 1985-model prices, heavily discounted
through incentive financing and other programs, to higher-priced 1986
models.1 Apart from cars and trucks, prices of other finished consumer
goods and of capital equipment were not much changed overall in the October
PPI.
1. In the CPI, however, the prices of new-model cars are phased in
gradually, reflecting the pattern of sales to consumers; and, as indi-
cated above, auto financing is included separately under private
transportation services. Moreover, the CPI includes the prices of
imported as well as of domestically-produced cars.

To date, there is little evidence of any runup in prices owing
to the weaker dollar. Non-oil import prices were essentially flat in
the third quarter, the latest period for which data are available, follow-
ing three quarters of decline. More recently, price increases have been
announced by Japanese firms for a number of manufactured products, including
autos and electronic items. However, partly offsetting these developments,
commodity prices have declined, on balance, in recent weeks.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
After pausing in October, M1 resumed its brisk expansion. The narrow
money measure grew at a 13 percent annual rate in November. The broader
aggregates also accelerated considerably in November--but mostly because of
the resurgence of M1, as household saving apparently remained limited and
perhaps was directed to an unusual degree toward investments in bonds and
bond funds. Increases in M2 and M3 were moderate and, in contrast to the
marked overshoot for M1, both of these aggregates remained within their
longer-run target ranges.
Pressures on reserve positions of depository institutions have not
changed appreciably since the last FOMC meeting, and federal funds have
traded mainly in the vicinity of 8 percent. Other short-term rates have
been essentially unchanged, or up slightly, but this has not prevented the
bond markets from registering a substantial rally that has pushed long-
term rates to their lowest levels in several years. Bond traders evidently
interpreted the FOMC's acceptance of the M1 overshoot as indicating that
the System likely would not tighten reserve provision in the absence of
evidence of strong economic growth or emerging inflationary pressures; many
also were encouraged by congressional efforts to settle on some version of
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction proposal.
Overall debt growth appears to have picked up recently, particularly
in the longer-term sector. Following congressional action in mid-November
to raise the federal debt ceiling, the Treasury came to the market with an
unprecedented burst of borrowing. Merger-related financing contributed
to increased business borrowing in November, which boosted business loans
at banks and issuance of commercial paper and long-term bonds. In the

tax-exempt market, bond offerings rose to a record in November; refunding
bonds accounted for a full 40 percent of the total. Issuers-in many cases
representing private interests--took advantage of the lower rates and rushed
to avoid tax law changes that could become effective after year-end.
Mortgage loan demand, too, apparently has been bolstered by lower long-
term interest rates. The mortgage-backed securities market has continued
to boom, with broadening investor participation; meanwhile, data through
October suggest a rising trend of thrift-institution lending. Consumer
credit growth moderated early in the fourth quarter, after most special
auto financing programs ended. Delinquency rates on consumer credit have
been rising toward historically high levels, and personal bankruptcies are
at a postwar high; yet banks report little effort thus far to tighten
standards on consumer loans.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 growth rebounded in November to a 13 percent annual rate, more
than double its average September-October pace.1 Much of the strength in M1
last month reflected a pickup in the growth of other checkable deposits
(OCDs) to a rate approaching the robust summer pace. Demand deposits also
contributed to the November rise in M1. Perhaps one-quarter of the month's
expansion in demand deposits-but less than one-tenth of total M1 growth--
can be attributed to a computer malfunction affecting Treasury security
operations at the Bank of New York on November 21. The shutdown prevented
the transfer of a large volume of securities to the purchasers, leaving in
demand accounts a portion of the funds that were to be used as payment.
1. The acceleration of narrow money may be overstated due to seasonal ad-
justment difficulties; estimates based on concurrent seasonal adjustment
procedures indicate that narrow money grew at a 10 percent clip in November,
as compared with an average 8 percent annual rate during the previous two
months.

III-4
M2 growth also picked up in November, reflecting the surge in M1,
leaving this measure in the upper part of its long-run range. The non-M1
component of M2 has grown at a sluggish pace in recent months, with much of
the weakness concentrated in taxable M2-type money market mutual funds and
small time deposits. Some investors reportedly have been drawing on money
fund balances--and perhaps reducing their deposits--to finance purchases
of bonds and stocks, either directly or through mutual funds. Bond funds
and unit trusts have grown dramatically this year, and probably have been
attracting funds from savers who are seeking to maintain their interest
income in the face of declining deposit rates.
Small time deposits--which account for roughly half of non-M1 M2--
were unchanged in November, following runoffs during the preceding several
months. Some of the variation in growth of small time deposits and other
interest-bearing deposits in 1985 may have stemmed from changes in the
relative yields on these types of deposits. In the spring months, when
offering rates on small time deposits were substantially above rates
available on MMDAs and OCDs, small time deposits rose. In the summer, by
contrast, the rate advantage of small time deposits narrowed and these
accounts experienced net outflows. But in recent months the rate spread
has again widened and runoffs of small time deposits have ebbed.
M3 expanded at a 5 percent annual rate in November, which kept this
aggregate near the middle of its 1985 target range. Growth in M3 was
entirely due to its M2 component; its non-M2 component edged down overall
despite continued rapid expansion of large time deposits. At commercial
banks, demands for managed liabilities were limited by a $9 billion inflow
of U.S. Treasury deposits after the temporary extension of the federal debt

III-5
ceiling. Thrift institutions, by contrast, have been relying heavily on
manaaged liabilities--including Home Loan Bank advances and other borrow-
ings--to finance their asset growth in recent months.
Total bank credit rose at a 17 percent annual rate in November, the
largest monthly increase since 1980. Growth in securities holdings was
especially strong. Banks acquired a sizable volume of the Treasury securi-
ties that came to market in November, after running off a large amount in
October, presumably in association with the reduced issuance of government
securities in that month. The strength in the "other securities" category
reflected sizable acquisitions of tax-exempt issues. Loan growth at banks
also increased sharply, particularly business and consumer lending.
Business Finance
Merger-related financing and lower interest rates spurred a pickup in
overall business credit growth in November. Short-term business borrowing
from banks and in the commercial paper market rose at a combined 16-1/2 per-
cent annual rate. At the same time, given the decline in long-term rates,
firms borrowed heavily in both the corporate and tax-exempt bond markets.
Four large mergers were completed in November at a cost to the surviving
firms of almost $13 billion. In addition, there were some smaller acquisi-
tions and a heavier flow of share repurchases. Virtually all these share
retirements were financed initially with short-term debt, and they accounted
for nearly all of the net increase in bank business loans and much of the
substantial increase in commercial paper outstanding. In the bond market,
about a third of total issuance in November refinanced earlier mergers.
Almost half of November's total nonfinancial bond volume, including
issues sold abroad, was 30-year straight debt, contributing to a lengthening

in debt maturities. While lower bond rates evidently were strong stimulants
to nonfinancial volume, issuance by financial firms slowed, reflecting in
part a moderation in the number of new CMOs.
Stock prices have rallied during the intermeeting period, with a rise
of 6-7 percent in broadly based indexes and a total gain since the beginning
of the year of around 25 percent. The aggregate value of stock market wealth
this year has risen by more than $300 billion, net of stock retirements.
Prices have benefited from lower interest rates and a stronger profit out-
look. New issue volume initially,showed little response to the recent
price gains, but began to pick up in early December.
U.S. Government Securities Market
The federal debt ceiling disrupted financing of the deficit from late
September through November. After exhausting its cash balance in the second
week of October, the Treasury shifted government trust fund investments
from Treasury securities to debt issues of the Federal Financing Bank;
the Treasury later took the additional step of paying down some trust fund
investments. Both of these actions lessened its debt subject to the ceiling
and permitted new funds to be raised. These techniques kept the government
running until November 14, when the Congress approved a temporary increase
in the debt ceiling.
The Treasury quickly utilized its new borrowing authority. The day
after the congressional action, the Treasury sold $22 billion of cash
management bills, which provided funding until the Treasury could market
its postponed coupon securities and conduct its regular bill auctions. All
told, beginning on November 15, the Treasury came to the market on nine
consecutive business days, selling $100 billion of new securities and

raising $27-1/4 billion of new funds. In addition, Treasury issuance of
nonmarketable state and local government securities surged in November,
reflecting purchases made from proceeds of a record volume of tax-exempt
refunding bonds.
The debt ceiling began again to pose problems for the Treasury on
December 6, when the temporary extension of the ceiling expired. Conse-
quently, the regular weekly bill auction scheduled for December 9 was
postponed. If the Gramm-Rudman amendment is not passed and signed on
December 11, Congress is expected to enact a further temporary extension
of the debt ceiling to permit financing on December 12, when the Treasury
would otherwise exhaust its cash balance.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored agencies appears to have picked
up in the current quarter from a relatively low level in the third quarter.
The largest change in borrowing is attributable to the Farm Credit Banks.
After consistently paying down debt in preceding quarters, the Banks are
expected to have raised a small volume of new funds during the fourth
quarter, primarily through short-term discount notes. These new funds are
being used to build the liquidity position of the Banks; loans at these
institutions are continuing to decline, because of both reduced demand and
write-offs of bad loans. Borrowing by Freddie Mac and Sallie Mae also is
estimated to have strengthened in the fourth quarter, while borrowing by
Fannie Mae and the Home Loan Banks is about unchanged.
Interest rate spreads between sponsored-agency and Treasury securi-
ties have narrowed recently. In late November, the Federal Home Loan Banks
issued 2- and 3-year securities at rates of 15 to 20 basis points over
Treasuries. This contrasts with spreads of 30 to 40 basis points on

similar issues in September and October, when investors were more concerned
that the Home Loan Banks would be tapped for large sums to fund the subsidi-
ary of the FHLB system set up to dispose of assets acquired by FSLIC. Also
in late November, the Farm Credit Banks sold new 6-month and 18-month
securities with rates about 80 basis points above the returns on Treasuries
--down about 20 basis points from the spread earlier in the month. These
spreads narrowed an additional 15 to 20 basis points in early December,
after Senate passage of a bill to strengthen the Farm Credit System.
Tax-Exempt Market
Issuance of tax-exempt bonds has increased dramatically because of
the approaching effective date of proposed tax law changes and the further
decline in interest rates. Gross offerings of long-term tax-exempt bonds
reached a record of $22 billion in November, well above the strong volumes
of the preceding several months.
The administration's tax reform package, as well as the bill recently
reported by the House Ways and Means Committee, would restrict the types
of debt eligible for tax-exempt status and would apply to all bonds issued
after the end of this month. Although the effective date could be changed
and the prospects of any tax legislation are uncertain, many issuers have
been unwilling to jeopardize the tax-exempt status of their bonds by issuing
in 1986. While the administration's proposal is considerably more restric-
tive, both packages would limit the use of tax-exempt debt for private
purposes and would further restrict advance refunding issues and the poten-
tial for arbitrage earnings.
Refunding bond issuance especially has been stimulated by the combina-
tion of potential tax law changes and low interest rates. Offerings of

these bonds during the spring and summer were brisk at around $4 billion
per month, but surged to $8 billion in November. For the year as a whole,
refundings, including both immediate and advance refinancings, could account
for a record 30 percent of total tax-exempt bond offerings.
A broadly based increase in demand for tax-exempt bonds has enabled
their yields to decline with other longer-term rates despite the sharp rise
in supply. Yields have dropped particularly on general obligation bonds,
which have accounted for nearly a third of tax-exempt offerings in recent
months. Large purchases by commercial banks have boosted demand for G.O.
bonds. Under either of the two current tax reform packages, banks stand to
lose the 80 percent deduction allowed for the interest expense incurred in
carrying tax-exempt bonds purchased after December 31.
Owing in part to the surge in bank purchases of G.O.s, the spread
between revenue bond and G.O. yields had widened to the lar t margin in
several years before narrowing some in recent weeks. The ratio of tax-
exempt revenue bond yields to taxable rates has remained quite high, while

yields on G.O.s relative to Treasury bonds declined for much of the autumn
before turning up late last month.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on home mortgages have declined by nearly 1/2 per-
centage point in both the primary and the secondary markets since the last
FOMC meeting. At S&Ls, contract interest rates on new commitments for
fixed-rate conventional home mortgages have dropped to 11-1/2 percent,
more than 3 percentage points below their August 1984 peak.
The latest decline in commitment rates on fixed-rate mortgages
exceeded the movement in ARM rates. On these variable-cost financing
arrangements, which have continued to account for about half of aggregate
conventional home mortgage originations, initial contract interest rates
on new commitments at S&Ls for one-year contracts have been unchanged, on
balance, since early November. Initial rate spreads favoring ARMs thus
have narrowed to the smallest margin since March of this year.
With interest rates easing, growth in residential mortgage credit
picked up during the third quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
about 11 percent, according to preliminary estimates. Net credit demands
again increased by somewhat more than residential investment expenditures,
apparently owing to funding of a stepped-up volume of existing-home trans-
actions, along with some additional borrowing against housing equity. A
growing, but still quite limited, portion of mortgage activity so far this
year has been attributable to second (junior) loans, according to FHLMC
estimates. Commercial banks, it is believed, have been supplying the
largest volume of second mortgage funds through real-estate-secured equity
lines of credit and other programs.

Residential mortgage lending during the third quarter was bolstered
by a surge in loan pooling arrangements; in October, issuance of mortgage
passthrough securities slowed somewhat but then bounced up to a new high
in November. Meanwhile, total mortgage asset holdings at FSLIC-insured
thrifts continued to grow briskly in October, and loan originations
jumped sharply to a record volume. Even heavier thrift mortgage originations
are apt to be forthcoming, judging from an additional rise in new mortgage
commitments during October. Commercial bank lending on all kinds of real
estate strengthened in October and remained almost as active during November.
The FHA adjustable-rate mortgage program, initiated in August 1984,
recently has gathered considerable momentum. Trade sources suggest that
investors, viewing prospects for the containment of inflation as more
favorable, have become less concerned about the restrictive interest rate
cap on FHA ARMs. (The FHA ARM annual rate cap is only one percentage
point; many conventional ARMs carry caps of two points.) Moreover,
tightened standards in the private mortgage insurance industry and elsewhere,
which have limited the availability of high loan-to-value ratio conventional
ARMs, have made FHA ARMs look more attractive to both lenders and borrowers.
Consumer Installment Credit
Growth of consumer installment credit slowed to a 15 percent annual
rate in October, primarily reflecting the end of special financing incentives
that had strongly stimulated auto lending by finance companies in late
August and throughout September.
Credit difficulties in the household sector have been increasing
rapidly in recent quarters. In the third quarter, delinquencies continued
to rise on both closed-end consumer installment credit at commercial banks

and auto loans at finance companies; the delinquency rate on bank credit
card plans has reached its previous highs (see chart on page 111-20).
Banks sampled in the Survey of Senior Loan Officer Opinion reported
experiencing some increase in delinquency rates on consumer credit during
1985, but as of early November, only a few of them had taken or planned to
take actions to tighten credit standards or to increase collection efforts.
In the mortgage credit area, delinquencies on first-mortgage home
loans turned up in the third quarter but remained a bit below the record
high rate--nearly 2 percent of all loans past due 60 days or more-reached
in the first quarter. Repayment difficulties on second mortgages generally
have stayed below the level of delinquencies on either consumer installment
loans at banks or on first-mortgage home loans.
Consistent with the trends in loan delinquencies, the number of
personal bankruptcies per thousand households reached a new high during the
third quarter of 1985. The bankruptcy ratio has risen sharply
throughout this year, after declining in most of the two immediately
preceding years. No legal or administrative changes have occurred that
would help account for the recent uptrend, unlike the period after late
1979 when personal bankruptcy filings were boosted by major revisions in
the bankruptcy code in addition to a business cycle downturn.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted value of the dollar has declined 1-1/4 percent
further since the last FOMC meeting, to a level 9 percent below its
level just prior to the G-5 announcement on September 22. Although, on
balance, since September 22, the dollar has depreciated more against the
yen than against the other currencies, since the last FOMC meeting the
dollar has registered a larger decline vis-a-vis the German mark than
against the yen. As shown in the lower panel of the chart, over the
intermeeting period the dollar fell 2-1/2 percent against the mark,
while easing 2 percent against the yen.
During the first half of November, movements in the dollar-yen
bilateral rate were the most pronounced among the major currencies.
With the decision in late October by the Bank of Japan not to accom-
modate fully the seasonal liquidity demand in the fourth quarter, both
short and long-term interest rates on yen securities had risen about 100
basis points. Subsequent statements by Governor Sumita reaffirming the
Bank of Japan' s commitment to a strong yen led market participants to
anticipate a further sustained firming in rates, and interest rates on
longer maturities climbed an additional 50 basis points, further
narrowing the differential between U.S. and Japanese long-term rates.
After mid-November, however, rates on long-term yen securities
declined. With the Japanese yen trading briefly below 200 yen per
dollar for the first time in more than 4-1/2 years and reports that
commercial interests in Japan were concerned about the effects of too
sharp an appreciation in the yen, ambiguous statements by Japanese

officials that they would like to see the yen stabilize at a high level
were interpreted by market participants as indications that perhaps the
yen had reached an acceptable level, reducing the need for continued
upward pressure on interest rates. Rates on long-term yen securities
fell nearly 80 basis points in the latter half of November compared with
a 30 basis point decline in U.S. long-term rates, and the dollar firmed
somewhat against the yen. In contrast, European long-term interest
rates were little changed. As a result, the recent declines in U.S.
rates have eroded somewhat the long-term interest rate differential
favoring U.S. dollar securities over mark securities. Long-term
interest rates in the United Kingdom, which have been above U.S. rates,
now exceed U.S. rates by an even larger margin.
Recently, the dollar has firmed on a weighted-average basis.
statements by Governor Sumita indicating
that he expects to see central banks move towards a managed float
strengthened the view in the market that the central banks might act to
provide a floor for the dollar. Last week, sterling fell sharply --
depreciating 4-1/2 percent against the dollar -- on reports that OPEC
will cut its prices to maintain its market share. Relative to the last
FOMC meeting, the pound has depreciated 1 percent against the dollar as
the earlier gain associated with the favorable movements in interest
rate differentials was more than reversed in the past week.
With respect to other currencies, trading in pesos in New York has
been suspended since November 5 when Mexican authorities introduced new
rules governing foreign banks' operations in pesos. These regulations
were intended to stem capital flight from Mexico, which had been

IV-4
stimulated by the government's policy of pegging the Treasury-bill rate
at relatively unattractive yields and by expropriation of urban property
following the September earthquakes. Since mid-November, the peso has
appreciated about 7 percent in quotes for the free rate by Mexican
exchange houses as the announcement of planned reductions in the budget
deficit and the decision to join GATT were received favorably in the
market. In contrast, the controlled rate for the peso has been
depreciated at an accelerating rate, narrowing the extent to which the
value of the controlled peso exceeds that of the free one.
The Canadian dollar initially weakened as market participants
expected that difficulties at several Canadian banks in October would
foster an accomodative monetary stance. Recently, pressure on the
Canadian dollar has intensified with the release of Canadian
international reserve figures, which implied that roughly $700 million
in intervention had been done with the Canadian dollar nevertheless
continuing to weaken. On a bilateral basis, the Canadian dollar is now
only fractionally above its all-time low against the dollar of February

IV-5
1985 .Over
the past few weeks, however, short-term interest rates in Canada have
firmed somewhat, suggesting that the Bank of Canada also is using
monetary policy to support its currency.

IV-6
U.S. International Financial Transactions
The recorded net foreign capital inflow in September and October
corresponding to the continued large current account deficit occurred
through sizable private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities, large foreign net purchases of bonds issued in the
Euromarkets by U.S. corporations and moderate net inflows into the
domestic offices of U.S. banks. (See the Summary Table on U.S.
International Transactions.)
Foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities totalled more
than $9 billion over the two-month period of September and October, up
sharply from the preceding months. This amount reflected continued
heavy net purchases by Japanese investors and a large purchase by the
World Bank. Reports from market participants suggest that the Japanese
played a somewhat smaller role in the purchase of new issues in
November.
Foreign net purchases of bonds issued by U.S. corporations
totalled $8.5 billion during the September-October period (line 2a), an
increase from the already heavy pace of these purchases recorded earlier
this year. Data on issuance of bonds by U.S. corporations in the
Euromarket indicate that nearly one quarter of the total issuance over
the period was denominated in foreign currencies, though in most cases
the use of swaps in conjunction with bond issuance eliminated the
foreign currency exposure of the U.S. residents issuing these securities.
Preliminary data for November indicate some decline in the rate of
issuance of Eurobonds by U.S. corporations.

The very large issuance of Eurobonds during September-October
have been influenced by changes in market participants' expectations
about the future course of interest rates due to developments in the
U.S. government securities market. Prospects for an extremely large
offering of U.S. Treasury securities in November when the debt ceiling
was due to be temporarily relaxed, may have led to expectations of a
rise in interest rates and thereby stimulated the issuance of corporate
bonds in October. In addition, the decline in the slope of the yield
curve since September, which in part may reflect the expectation of
progress by the U.S. government in reducing its fiscal deficit in the
longer run, may have induced some firms to issue bonds so as to
restructure their liabilities in favor of longer-maturity obligations.
Domestic offices of U.S. banks experienced a net inflow of
$5 billion during the two month period ending in October (see line 1).
The large net inflow for October primarily reflects a $6.5 million
reduction of the net claims of domestic offices on their foreign
affiliates; this, in turn, may be the result of the banks' response to a
decline in Treasury deposits experienced prior to the relaxation of the
debt ceiling in November.
After rising gradually during much of the third quarter, foreign
official reserve assets held in the United States fell in September and
October.
Data on foreign official holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York show a moderate decline for November.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
Revised U.S. merchandise trade data on an international
transactions basis were released on Wednesday, December 11, for the
period 1983 through the third quarter of 1985. The table below
summarizes the new trade patterns. The trade deficit increased to $133
billion at an annual rate in the third quarter. Exports declined for
the third quarter in a row. While the decline in agricultural exports
was relatively moderate from the second to the third quarter,
agricultural exports have dropped 33 percent since the fourth quarter of
1984. Nonagricultural exports decreased by a small amount in the third
quarter. Imports rose in the third quarter to a level almost equal that
of the fourth quarter of last year. Oil imports declined slightly from
the second to the third quarter which only partly offset the rise in
nonoil imports. A more complete description of trade developments on a
revised basis will be included in the Greenbook Supplement.
Trade data for the month of October are available only on an
unrevised basis, and uncertainty about the size of the carry-over of
late documents makes it impossible to assess October imports at this
time. Exports in October were slightly less than in September or for
the average of the third quarter. This appears to be true whether
revised or unrevised data are used. The largest declines in exports
were in chemicals, machinery, trucks to Canada, and aircraft.
The revised data recompile the trade figures to reflect the actual
month of entry for imports and the month of shipment for exports. In
previously published data, late documents were just added to the current
month's figures. For example, of the (unrevised) value of imports

IV-11
reported last month for October, 35 percent actually occurred in earlier
months; this percentage of carry-over has varied during the months of
1985 from 35 to 55 percent for imports and from 7 to 13 percent for
exports. The net effect of the revisions has been to reduce
substantially the volatility of quarterly merchandise trade data.
Monthly data, however, still move about quite a bit, particularly for
imports. These revised data will be incorporated in the press release
on U.S. international transactions (probably December 16) and in the
comprehensive revision of the GNP accounts scheduled for release on
December 20.

Foreign Economic Developments. Economic growth in the major foreign
industrial countries continues to be moderate. Although the pace of
recovery in Japan has slowed, economic activity in Canada and Germany
shows signs of increasing strength. Industrial production in France and
Italy, however, remains weak. Inflation abroad has been moderate and
has declined in recent months in both France and the United Kingdom.
German inflation remains very low. On average, the external positions
of the major foreign industrial countries have strengthened from last
year. None of the major foreign industrial countries had a trade
deficit during the last month for which data was available, reflecting
improvements in British, French, and Italian trade figures. The current
account in both Japan and Germany continues to be in substantial surplus.
The Canadian current account, however, was in deficit in the third
quarter, the first quarterly deficit in two years.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, preliminary data indicate that
GNP grew 2.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, consistent with
continued but slower growth than that experienced last year. The index
of industrial production rose 1.3 percent (s.a.) in October, partially
reversing declines experienced during the two preceeding months; average
IP for the three months ending in October was 3.1 percent above its
year-earlier level. Retail sales rose by 1.0 percent (s.a.) in October,
and new housing starts rose in September and October after falling in
the five preceding months. In October, new housing starts were 5.4
percent above their year-earlier level.
The Tokyo consumer price index rose 2.7 percent during the 12
months ending in October, up 0.5 percent from the equivalent rate

recorded in September. Japan's external surpluses continued at record
rates. For the first ten months of 1985, the cumulative trade surplus
was $52 billion (s.a.a.r.) and the corresponding cumulative current
account surplus was $46 billion (s.a.a.r.). The current account surplus
in 1984 was $35 billion.
In the context of the September 22 G-5 initiative, the Bank of
Japan on October 24 moved to foster a further strengthening of the yen
exchange rate by announcing that it would not fully accomodate expected
heavy seasonal demands for liquidity in the fourth quarter. Following
the announcement, short-term and long-term interest rates rapidly rose
by more than 100 and 150 basis points, respectively. Although long-term
interest rates have subsequently declined somewhat, short-term interest
rates have remained firm. These interest rate hikes, if sustained,
could dampen the impact of the mid-October demand stimulus package on
Japan's external balance.
Industrial production in Germany rose 1.8 percent (s.a.) in
October, bringing average IP for the three months ending in October to
3.4 percent above its year-earlier level. In addition, early
indications are that GNP growth in the third quarter was relatively
strong; and survey data on the business climate, investment intentions,
and order books all point to relatively strong demand. There are some
signs of improvement in the labor market. Employment has been rising
since the summer and part-time employment, which can be viewed as
partial unemployment, has decreased markedly in the presence of rising
registered job openings. The unemployment rate, however, remained at
9.2 percent (s.a.) in November.

IV-18
Consumer prices have barely changed since March and in November
were only 1.8 percent above their year-earlier levels. Unit labor costs
are currently below their level of a year ago.
Through October, the cumulative current account surplus was $9
billion (n.s.a.) compared with less than $2 billion during the
corresponding period last year. Most of the improvement has been
associated with a growing trade surplus.
Economic activity in France remains weak and inflation continues to
decline. Industrial production fell 1.5 percent (s.a.) in September and
was unchanged from its year-earlier level. Real GDP in the third
quarter increased by 2.4 percent (s.a.a.r) but was up only 1.1 percent
on a year-over-year basis. Consumer prices increased only 0.4 percent
(n.s.a.) in October as the twelve-month inflation rate eased to 5
percent, down from 6-1/2 percent at the beginning of the year.
Wholesale prices fell 0.5 percent (n.s.a.) in October, and were
unchanged from their year-earlier levels.
The trade balance moved into surplus by $120 million (s.a.) in
October. For the first ten months of the year, the cumulative trade
deficit was $2.5 billion (s.a.a.r.), slightly less than that experienced
last year.
Over the past few months, French officials have outlined their
plans for the conduct of monetary policy in 1986. In order to take
account of the ongoing process of financial innovation, the existing
monetary aggregates, M1, M2, and M3, will be redefined and a new broader
aggregate, L, will be introduced.. Open market operations will replace
quantitative credit controls as the main method of implementing monetary

IV-19
policy by 1987. This year's monetary target of 4-6 percent growth of
M2R will be replaced in 1986 by a target of 3-5 percent growth of
redefined M3. French authorities have indicated that the the two
targets are considered roughly equivalent in terms of monetary ease or
tightness. (This year's target apparently will be exceeded slightly.)
Aspects of the proposed new monetary policy procedures remain unclear,
and further modifications appear likely as the changes are implemented
next year.
Preliminary data suggest that real GDP (output measure) in the
United Kingdom rose 2.0 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter to 3.7
percent above its year-earlier level. About half of the third quarter
growth resulted from the aftereffects of the ending in March of the coal
miners' strike. The average index of industrial production was
unchanged between the second and third quarters, although IP rose
strongly in September.
The sharp acceleration in U.K. price inflation that took place in
the spring has abated. Retail prices rose only 0.3 percent (n.s.a.)
between June and October, lowering the twelve-month inflation rate to
5.4 percent. However, the underlying rate of increase in average
earnings rose to 7-1/4 percent in September. The U.K. trade account was
in balance in October while the current account was in surplus. The
cumulative trade deficit for the first ten months of 1985 was $3.1
billion (s.a.a.r.) and the corresponding cumulative current account
surplus was $2.8 billion. The trade deficit in 1984 was $5.7 billion.
In his recent Autumn Statement, delivered to Parliament on November
12, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson indicated that real

IV-20
government expenditures would grow an estimated 0.7 percent in fiscal
1986/87 and then remain (nearly) constant during the subsequent two
fiscal years. The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement is expected to
fall from 2-1/4 percent of GDP in fiscal 1985/86 to 2 percent in fiscal
1986/87, in part because increased sales of nationalized industries
would help finance the deficit. Although Chancellor Lawson did not
reveal the government's tax plans, private commentators have suggested
that the fiscal goals articulated in the Autumn Statement would be
consistent with a tax cut in fiscal 1986/87 amounting to a little over
1/2 percent of GDP. However, a substantial decline in oil prices, by
lowering associated tax revenues, could significantly reduce the scope
for income tax cuts if the government adheres to its PSBR targets.
Real GNP in Canada increased 6.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third
quarter, after average growth of about 4 percent in the first two
quarters of 1985. This rise, which resulted from a strong increase in
final domestic demand, was fairly widespread among sectors. The
unemployment rate was 10.2 percent (s.a.) in November, slightly below
its third quarter average.
Inflation in Canada continued at a moderate pace. Consumer prices
increased 0.3 percent in October and the twelve-month inflation rate
rose slightly to 4.2 percent. The industry selling price increased 0.2
percent in September, bringing the twelve-month inflation rate in
wholesale prices to 2.4 percent. The Canadian trade account remained in
surplus in October; for the first ten months of the year, the cumulative
trade surplus was $11.3 billion (s.a.a.r.). Canada's current account

IV-21
deficit was $4.4 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, the first
quarterly deficit in two years.
The Continental Bank of Canada arranged a C$ 2.9 billion support
package in November from the big-six chartered banks and the Bank of
Canada. This action was taken to restore confidence in Continental
after 20 percent of its deposits were withdrawn in October.
Continental's problems stemmed from market uncertainty and confusion
over recent failures of the Canadian Commercial Bank and Northland Bank
and the announced merger of the Mercantile Bank with the National Bank
of Canada. According to a recent audit conducted by the big-six banks
for the Inspector General, Continental Bank "is engaged in normal
lending practices and ...is a viable institution."
Industrial production in Italy rose slightly in September. The
index of industrial production in the third quarter was 0.5 percent
below its level in the same quarter in 1984. The official government
survey conducted in September showed that consumer confidence is at its
highest level in the last several years.
The consumer price index rose 0.7 percent (n.s.a.) in November to
8.6 percent above its year-earlier level, the same twelve month
inflation rate as experienced last year. In September, the wholesale
price index (n.s.a.) was 6.4 percent above its level in September 1984.
Rates of increase of the wholesale price index have been steadily lower
in the last six months. The trade account showed a tiny surplus in
September, lowering the trade deficit in the third quarter to $1.1
billion (s.a.a.r), compared with a deficit of $15.1 billion (s.a.a.r.)
in the first half of the year.

IV-22
By surviving a vote of confidence, Prime Minister Craxi's
government is now the longest standing one in the history of the
Republic. Craxi is taking advantage of his strengthened political
position by trying to push the 1986 budget through Parliament before
December 31.

IV-23
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries. Economic growth
and export performance in the major developing countries have slowed
somewhat on average in 1985 following a strong performance in 1984. In
Argentina, the economic slowdown preceded the introduction of the
anti-inflationary "Austral Plan" in June, which set the stage for the
signing in August of a revised IMF standby agreement and commercial bank
loan package. By late November, these new funds enabled Argentina to
become fully current on interest obligations on public sector debts to
banks for the first time in more than three years. Mexico's economy
grew rapidly in the first half of 1985 -- stimulated by a fiscal deficit
that was sharply higher than in 1984 -- but GDP growth slowed during the
second half of the year. The current account appears to have
deteriorated from a surplus of $4 billion in 1984 to a deficit of about
$800 million in 1985, owing to weak prices for oil exports, a slowdown
in the U.S. economy, and the failure to maintain a competitive exchange
rate until after the devaluation of the peso in July 1985. In
Venezuela, domestic activity remained weak due to the combination of a
weakening of the oil market and a restrictive government fiscal policy
that produced another public sector surplus in 1985. In contrast,
Brazil's economy expanded vigorously, as real GDP growth surged to about
7 percent in 1985. Export volume declined only slightly, and the trade
surplus has continued at a $12 billion annual rate. However, inflation
remains high, reflecting the government's inability to reduce the fiscal
deficit and its unwillingness to accept targets for reduction of that
deficit that would satisfy the IMF.
Individual Country Notes. Argentina's interest payments on public
sector debts to banks have become current for the first time in more

IV-24
than three years. On November 26, Argentina received the second
disbursement from the $4.2 billion bank loan signed last August,
amounting to $800 million, and simultaneously paid $340 million to
eliminate the remaining arrears. The next disbursement, for $600
million, is contingent on Argentina having drawn the IMF stand-by
tranche linked to end-September performance criteria. Since some of the
criteria were not met, disbursements totalling $850 million from the IMF
and the commercial banks, originally scheduled for November and
December, will not take place until early 1986.
In the past four months, the consumer price index has increased at
an annual rate of about 32 percent. This compares with a rise of more
than 1,100 percent in the 12 months ended last June. A tightening of
domestic credit conditions in November has contributed to an appreci-
ation of the austral in the free market. The free market premium for
the dollar, which had peaked at around 19 percent on October 25, fell to
around 6 percent on December 10.
The Mexican authorities announced in late November a budget for
1986 that would reduce the public sector deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP
in 1986 from an officially expected 9.6 percent in 1985. The 1986
deficit target is the same as that originally set for 1985 under
Mexico's suspended IMF program. The 1986 official forecast is for real
economic growth to slow to no more than 1 percent from about 3 percent
in 1985 and for the inflation rate to fall to the 45-50 percent range
from the 60 percent level this year. However, the large deviations from
the public sector deficit target that occurred in 1985 and the mounting
demands for stimulation of the economy and for large wage increases cast
doubts on whether the authorities will follow through on the announced

IV-25
plans. Mexico also decided in late November to join GATT, signaling a
long-term commitment to a policy of increased trade liberalization long
resisted by many Mexican political leaders and businessmen. The next
test of that commitment will be Mexico's ability to negotiate a trade
policy sector loan from the World Bank that might give Mexico access to
new, fast-disbursing balance of payments financing from both the World
Bank and commercial banks in 1986.
The government instituted a policy in early October of attempting
to hold down Mexico's interest rates on Treasury bills in order to
reduce the cost of servicing the government debt. However, the policy
was a failure and the rate on 91-day bills has been increased by 700
basis points since mid-October. To facilitate government financing and
to limit money creation, the commercial banks were required in November
not to increase their loans to the private sector beyond the October 31
level. On November 5, the Bank of Mexico imposed new restrictions on
peso accounts of foreign banks in Mexican banks partly to prevent their
use in transferring funds out of the country and partly to stop foreign
banks from acting as intermediaries in the growing inter-company loan
market where the government contended that their activities interfered
with the conduct of monetary policy. The new measures effectively ended
trading in pesos in U.S. markets.
Real GDP in Brazil appears to have grown by about 7 percent in
1985. Inflation, which had slowed to about 9 percent per month in
September and October, surged to a 15 percent monthly rate in November
bringing prices to a level 230 percent higher than a year earlier. On
November 19, the government announced the liquidation of three banks.
The government effectively guaranteed the $160 million in short-term

IV-26
credits provided to these institutions' foreign branches. However, the
government has said that it will not guarantee about $450 million in
loans and deposits in these banks' Brazilian offices, and foreign banks
are upset about the Brazilian government's plans of something less than
full compensation for the foreign creditors along with some domestic
creditors. At the end of November the government announced new
projections of its fiscal position for 1985 and 1986. For 1985, the
operational deficit is now projected at about 2.8 percent of GNP, 2.4
percentage points higher than projected by the government when certain
budget cuts were announced in July 1985. For 1986, the government has
set a target of reducing the operational deficit to 0.5 percent of GDP.
Some of the revenue measures would not be permanent, however, such as
the sale of some government-owned enterprises. Brazilian officials have
stated recently that they have no need for an IMF program in the near
future because of Brazil's strong external position. Without an IMF
program, and with relations with foreign banks complicated by the recent
liquidations of Brazilian commercial banks, it may be difficult for
Brazil to negotiate a rescheduling with commercial banks and a continued
maintenance of interbank and trade credit lines. Nevertheless, Brazil
intends to try.
Chile met all but one of the performance criteria under its end-
September IMF program review. Net international reserves of the Central
Bank were lower than targeted because of delays in the signing of
Chile's bank financing package. A waiver was granted, however, and a
drawing from the IMF was made on November 15. The bank financing
package was formally signed on November 1, with the first disbursement
of the $1.1 billion new money facility expected by the end of the year.

IV-27
The Colombian government declared a 35-day economic emergency after
the November 13 volcanic eruption in order to speed assistance to
affected areas. The eruption caused major damage to local agriculture
and infrastructure, but is not expected to have a significant effect on
the overall performance of the Colombian economy. Colombia's commercial
bank jumbo loan will be signed in mid-December. Disbursements on the
loan will be delayed into 1986, and Colombia will probably receive a
commercial bank bridge loan in late December.
In mid-November, the Philippines and the IMF management concluded
their negotiations on a revision of the 18-month standby agreement
originally signed in December 1984. Along with agreement on new
quantitative performance criteria for December 1985 and March 1986,
there was also agreement on non-quantitative performance criteria,
including tax reform, exchange system policy, the budget deficit, and
reform of government monopolies in the sugar and coconut sectors. The
IMF Board is expected to approve the revised stand-by program on
December 20, and the Philippines will become eligible to draw SDR 212
million from the IMF. This will clear the way for the Philippines to
borrow an additional $175 million under the facility for $925 million of
new money from commercial banks approved earlier in the year. The first
$400 million tranche from that facility was drawn in August.
November 26 the Venezuelan government announced that it had
reachedagreement with its bank advisory committee on the major issues
that have held up the signing of Venezuela's debt rescheduling
agreement. Venezuela expects that the final signing will take place in
about two months.
