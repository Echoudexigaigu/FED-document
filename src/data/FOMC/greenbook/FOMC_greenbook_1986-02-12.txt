The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Incoming data indicate a pickup in the pace of production and
spending in December, although for the fourth quarter as a whole, activity
appears to have advanced at about the same rate as earlier in the year.
Prices reflected some transitory upward pressures from food and energy,
but wage increase have remained in line with the moderate rates over the
preceding two years.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production rose an estimated 0.7 percent in December
after no change, on net, over the preceding two months. Production gains
occurred in most market groups in December. Consumer goods and materials
both increased 0.8 percent, and output of business equipment, which had
softened earlier in the year, edged up 0.2 percent, in part because of an
apparent firming in the production of computers and other high technology
equipment. Autos were assembled at an 8.1 million unit annual rate,
almost 5 percent higher than their November pace, and likely rose further
in January.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities rose
in December for the second consecutive month, increasing 0.4 percentage
points to 80.5 percent. Nonetheless, the year-end operating rate remained
below the most recent peak of 82.0 percent in the summer of 1984.
Employment and Unemployment
Nonfarm payroll employment advanced 320,000 in December, and the
fourth-quarter rise was somewhat above the average for the preceding three
quarters. The service sector extended its trend of strong growth, with

sharp gains in business and health services and moderate increases in
finance, transportation, and wholesale trade. At retail trade establish-
ments, however, employment growth slackened considerably toward year end
owing primarily to less-than-usual holiday hiring at general merchandise
stores.
Labor demand has perked up in the manufacturing sector in recent
months. The number of factory jobs rose 45,000 in December, the third
consecutive monthly increase; thus, manufacturing employment has recovered
nearly half of the loss experienced earlier in the year. In addition,
the factory workweek moved up further during the fourth quarter. Together
with increased employment, the longer workweek contributed to a sizable
increase in production worker hours.
The unemployment rate, which was little changed over the first nine
months of the year, drifted down from 7.1 percent in October to 6.9
percent in December. On balance, jobless rates for adults edged down in
1985, while unemployment among teenagers showed little improvement.
Personal Income and Consumption
After slumping early in the fourth quarter, the consumer sector closed
out the year on a strong note, with sizable increases in December in both
personal income and consumption expenditures. Personal income in December
was up 1.4 percent--the largest monthly advance reported in the present
expansion. Wages and salaries posted a sharp gain. In addition, nonwage
income was boosted by subsidy payments to farmers, a recovery of rental

income after severe flooding in several eastern states, and higher interest
receipts.
Personal consumption expenditures, which had been held down by
sluggish auto sales earlier in the fourth quarter, increased 2 percent in
December. Boosted by an expanded round of incentive programs, sales of
domestic autos registered a strong rebound toward the end of the month
and were at an advanced 8.6 million unit annual rate in January. For the
fourth quarter as a whole, there were strong gains in outlays for
furniture and appliances and in sales of "other durable goods" (including
toys, jewelry, electronic games, and sports equipment). Spending for
nondurable goods also was up in the fourth quarter, and service outlays
rose by an unusually large amount as colder weather induced sharply
greater use of electricity and gas.
With expenditures rising considerably faster than disposable personal
income, the saving rate fell in December to 3.7 percent. Although the
recent BEA revisions generally raised the level of the saving rate, the
past few quarters still show a sharp decline in the rate and for 1985 as
a whole, the average saving rate was only 4.6 percent, about 2 percentage
points less than in 1984.
Business Fixed Investment
Real spending for nonresidential fixed investment surged 10-1/2
percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. Spending growth was
especially rapid for producers' durable equipment, possibly reflecting
firms' attempts to lock in tax benefits that might be eliminated for
equipment purchased after 1985.

Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods increased 4-1/4 percent
(not at an annual rate) in December, resulting in a 3-1/2 percent gain
for the fourth quarter as a whole. Spending advanced for nearly all
categories of equipment, with particularly robust growth for electrical
machinery. Fourth-quarter shipments of office and computing equipment
increased 1-1/4 percent in nominal terms and apparently included IBM's
sales of its new Sierra mainframe computer. With prices for computers
and related equipment falling sharply, this modest increase in nominal
shipments reflects considerable growth in real computer spending. Partially
offsetting the rise in overall fourth-quarter shipments was a substantial
decline in business auto purchases from their incentive-boosted third-quarter
levels.
Outlays for nonresidential construction advanced 5.1 percent in
December, after having been little changed on balance since August.
About one-half of the robust December increase occurred in the office
sector, which earlier had appeared to be softening.
Indicators of future spending point to slower fixed investment
growth than the rapid fourth-quarter pace. Despite a large increase
in December, new orders for nondefense capital goods were relatively flat
in the fourth quarter, and new commitments for nonresidential construction
do not suggest that spending on structures will show much near-term
strength. In addition, the Commerce Department fall survey of capital
spending plans, taken in October and November, suggests lackluster investment
spending in 1986, with businesses expecting to increase nominal outlays

Housing
After weakening in November, both housing starts and building
permits rebounded strongly in December. For the final quarter of 1985,
both starts and permits averaged 1.73 million units--very close to their
average rates for the first three quarters of the year.
The strength in December housing starts was in part attributable
to a 20 percent increase in the volatile multifamily component. A heavy
volume of tax-free financing provided by state and local bonds may have
added some temporary strength to this sector towards the end of the year.
Nonetheless, rental vacancy rates are near their highest level in almost
two decades, and construction of new multifamily units over the second
half of 1985 was down somewhat from the advanced pace seen earlier last
year.
In the single-family sector, starts were up sharply in December
from an unusually weak November pace, but the total for the quarter
remained in the same general range that has prevailed since early 1983.
The impact on demand of declines in mortgage interest rates since mid-1984
may have been counteracted by tighter loan qualification standards and by
the affect of continuing slower rates of appreciation in home prices on
buyer attitudes. In the sales area, new home sales improved a bit
at year-end, and existing home sales registered their fifth consecutive
quarterly increase in the final period of 1985, bringing the level of
such activity to its highest pace in six years.

Business Inventories
Business inventory investment in late 1985 reflected a sharp runup
in auto dealers' stocks and continuing efforts to keep stocks lean in
most other sectors, particularly manufacturing. Indeed, the book value
of manufacturing inventories fell at an annual rate of $16-1/2 billion in
December, the sixth consecutive monthly decline, and the stock-sales
ratio at year end was particularly low by historical standards. For some
industries, especially electrical machinery, the potential for inventory
building looks promising. On the other hand producers of basic metals
and some types of nonelectrical machinery are still faced with sluggish
orders and may continue to take a cautious inventory stance.
In the trade sector, the sharp accumulation of nonauto retail stocks
reported earlier in the fall appears to have subsided in November, owing
in part to the steady pickup in retail sales. Moreover, judging by
advance reports on orders and sales for December, the inventory situation
at nonauto trade establishments probably improved further in that month.
In contrast, there was a further increase in auto dealers' stocks.
Federal Government
Real federal government purchases rose sharply in the fourth quarter
as farmers relied heavily on the Commodity Credit Corporation to help
finance the growing inventory of farm crops. In the second half of 1985,
the real stocks owned or financed by the CCC accumulated at a record $20
billion annual rate. Meanwhile, real defense purchases were essentially
unchanged in the fourth quarter after a sharp increase in the previous

In addition to increases in defense and agricultural spending this
past year, interest outlays and social security and medicare payments also
showed significant growth. Meanwhile, increases in revenues failed to
match the rise in spending; and as a result, the federal budget deficit
(including off-budget outlays) was $75 billion in the fourth quarter, up
about $4 billion from the high level of a year earlier.
The administration and CBO announced in their Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
report on January 15 that, assuming real economic growth of 3-1/2 to 4
percent, the federal deficit would total about $220 billion in fiscal
1986 as a whole. This finding triggered the process that led to the
President's sequestration order on February 1, which is designed to
reduce outlays $11.7 billion ($20 billion at an annual rate) between
March 1 and September 30.
On February 5, the administration released its fiscal 1987 budget
proposals, which will be discussed in more detail in an appendix to the
Greenbook supplement. The budget documents provide estimates of federal
receipts and outlays along with a legislative blueprint for meeting the
deficit targets specified in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation. The
administration's current services estimates indicate that the deficit for
FY1987 would be $182 billion and decline to around $104 billion by
1991.1  In order to meet the $144 billion Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit
1. These estimates assume that current laws applying to taxes and entitle-
ments are unchanged, that there is 3 percent real growth in the defense
budget and that real nondefense spending is constant. They also assume
that there will be a relatively favorable economic performance of 4
percent annual real GNP growth, declining inflation and interest rates,
and marginally lower levels of unemployment.

II-15
target for fiscal 1987, the President proposed substantial reductions in
nondefense programs, including several domestic program eliminations.
State and Local Sector
Real purchases of goods and services in the state and local sector
were flat in the fourth quarter after two quarters of exceptionally
strong growth. Real construction outlays, which showed unusual strength
in mid-year, dropped at an 11 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter.
In contrast, employment continued to advance, rising 76,000 from September
to December. The fiscal position of state and local government continued
to weaken during the fall despite the slowing in nominal outlays, and the
operating and capital account surplus (excluding social insurance funds)
is estimated to have fallen to its lowest level in the current expansion.
The fourth-quarter decline in the surplus reflected sharply reduced growth
in sales tax receipts along with a slowdown in the growth of federal
grants.
Prices
Price increases during the closing months of 1985 were larger than
in previous months, but the pickup mainly reflected increases in agricul-
tural and energy prices that appear unlikely to persist. The consumer
price index for all urban consumers rose 0.6 percent in November and 0.4
percent in December; during the same months, producer prices in finished
goods were up 0.8 and 0.4 percent, respectively. However, outside the
food and energy sectors, consumer prices rose in November and December at
an average rate similar to that for the year as a whole, and producer

prices excluding food and energy were little changed over the two-month
period.
There are indications that the recent acceleration in food prices
may be short-lived. At the farm level, prices of domestically-produced
crude foods leveled off in December and appear to have declined in January.
In addition, the Department of Agriculture, in implementing the new Farm
Bill, has announced price support levels for a number of farm crops that
are significantly lower than the 1985 levels. These lower support prices
will become effective with the 1986 harvests, but may start to influence
market prices even sooner. In contrast, higher prices for coffee, reflecting
drought conditions in Brazil, appear likely to boost food price inflation
in the near-term.
In the energy sector, petroleum prices have tumbled since the start
of the year in response to the effects of a substantial increase in Saudi
Arabian production that started in October. The spot price of crude
oil has dropped by about $10 per barrel since early January, to the lowest
level in six years. The spot prices of petroleum products also have
plummeted. At a meeting in early February, OPEC was unable to agree on
a coordinate strategy to constrain output or stem the downward pressures
on prices.
The price data for items other than food and energy did not exhibit
any significant acceleration toward the end of 1985. At the producer
level, prices of capital equipment were unchanged on net from October to
December, and the prices of consumer goods were up only slightly. Serivce
prices rose, on average, at about the same pace as during the year as a whole.

There was no appreciable evidence of dollar-related price hikes in major
domestic price measures through December, although increases are anticipated
in coming months in light of announced rises for items such as cars and
electronic equipment.
The prices of spot industrial commodities have been relatively flat
since the start of 1986. In contrast, the prices of precious metals
shot up temporarily, apparently in response to the heightened political and
economic uncertainties associated with the U.S. freezing of Libyan assets
and labor unrest in South Africa; these increases, however, were largely
reversed in early February.
Wage and Labor Costs
Measures of wage change generally suggest that pay increases remained
quite moderate in the fourth quarter and that wage inflation leveled off
last year after decelerating in 1983 and 1984. The hourly earnings index,
which measures wages of production and nonsupervisory workers, rose 0.8
percent in December, bringing the quarterly increase to 3.3 percent at an
annual rate. For the year as a whole, the hourly earnings index rose 3
percent--about the same rate of increase as in 1984.
A more comprehensive measure of wages, the employment cost index
for wages and salaries, rose 4.1 percent in 1985; the higher rate in the
ECI reflects larger increases for workers excluded from the hourly earnings
index. Although the wages and salaries component of the ECI rose at
about the same pace as in 1984, hourly compensation costs, which include
employer costs for employee benefits as well as wages and salaries,

in compensation apparently reflected a sharp slowing in the growth of
fringe benefits as employers sought to reduce insurance and pension
costs.
The results of collective bargaining agreements indicate that wage
increases were especially small for union workers last year. Specified
wage adjustments, exclusive of any lump-sum payments and COLAs, for the
2.2 million workers covered by major union settlements reached during
1985 averaged 2.3 percent during the first contract year and 2.7 percent
over the contract life.
Despite continued moderation in wages, unit labor costs picked
up last year owing to slower productivity growth. In the fourth quarter
of 1985, productivity fell 1-3/4 percent at an annual rate as hiring was
brisk in the face of moderate output growth. With productivity essentially
flat over 1985, all of last year's 3-3/4 percent increase in nonfarm
compensation per hour was passed through to labor costs. As a result,
unit labor costs were up 3.8 percent in 1985 compared with a 3 percent
rise in 1984.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most interest rates have changed little on balance since the December
FOMC meeting. The securities markets have been rather volatile, however,
reflecting in part the substantial uncertainties surrounding prospects for
implementation of the Gramm-Rudman Act and the objectives of the G-5 auth-
orities with respect to interest and exchange rates. Traders also responded
strongly to indications of domestic output and price trends: interest rates
turned up in mid-January when some stronger-than-expected economic data
dampened hopes of a near-term cut in the discount rate, but they then moved
back down when spot oil prices plunged and official estimates of modest
fourth-quarter growth in GNP were published. Market participants have
responded only minimally to incoming money figures in the belief that the
Federal Reserve is giving the monetary aggregates little weight in its
operational decisions.
M1 growth slowed sharply in January from its brisk November-
December pace, reflecting a large runoff of demand deposits. M2 also
decelerated markedly, held down not only by the moderation in M1 but also
by weakness in its nontransactions component, especially overnight RPs.
M3 about matched its December growth rate as heavier issuance by banks of
large time deposits offset the slowdown in M2.
Aggregate borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors probably tapered
off in January, led by a reduction in credit demands by governmental units.
The Treasury's funding needs were reduced by an unusually large buildup in
its cash balance because of a surge in year-end sales of nonmarketable
securities to state and local governments. State and local units, which
had raised a huge volume of funds late last year, virtually ceased borrowing

on January 1 amid uncertainty about the tax-exempt status of issues marketed
after that date; the drying up in municipal bond volume resulted in a
widely anticipated drop in tax-exempt bond rates.
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses remained generally strong in
January, mainly in the long-term sector, although it retreated from its
vigorous year-end pace (which included many tax-exempt bond issues). Only
fragmentary evidence is available for household borrowing in January. In
the mortgage market, where interest rates were at seven-year lows, borrowing
seemed to be maintaining its vigor entering the new year. Also, consumer
installment borrowing likely picked up in January with the reintroduction
of below-market rates for new-car loans by auto finance companies.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Note on the monetary data: Annual benchmark and seasonal factor
revisions are in process. The data reported here are on an un-
revised basis. A discussion of revisions to the monetary
aggregates will be included in the Bluebook.
Expansion in both M1 and M2 abated considerably during January. The
slowdown in M1, to a 4 percent annual rate, reflected a runoff of demand
deposits, which have been unusually volatile in recent weeks. Meanwhile,
growth in currency remained moderate whereas growth in other checkable
deposits resumed a strong uptrend, even though the removal on January 1 of
the regulatory minimum balance of $1,000 on Super NOW accounts has not
boosted OCD inflows appreciably; depository institutions generally have
not lowered their required minimum balances to earn rates above the 5-1/4
percent ceiling on regular NOWs.
The deceleration in M2 also was evident in its nontransactions com-
ponent, where weakness was largely accounted for by a runoff in overnight

RPs that accompanied a reduction in holdings of government securities by
commercial banks. Overall inflows of retail deposits ebbed a bit in January
owing to minimal gains at thrift institutions. At both commercial banks
and thrifts the more liquid MMDAs and savings accounts strengthened, but
inflows to small time deposits slowed.
M3 growth in January remained at December's 7 percent annual rate
despite the deceleration in M2. The strength in its non-M2 component was
concentrated in issuance of large time deposits by commercial banks. By
contrast, growth in large time deposits at thrifts slackened in January.
S&Ls had augmented their retail deposits in December by selling CDs and
borrowing about $1 billion from their FHLBs; some of these funds were used
to accumulate liquid assets. FSLIC-insured institutions appear to have
been seeking to raise temporarily the level of their liabilities at year-
end because any required additions to net worth in 1986 will be based on
the growth in an institution's liabilities from the end of 1985.
Total bank credit advanced at a 17 percent annual rate in January as
the month-average level was swelled by late-December acquisitions of tax-
exempt assets in anticipation of changes in tax laws. Purchases of tax-
exempt bonds again boosted growth of the "other securities" category to an
annual rate exceeding 100 percent in January, more than offsetting a sharp
decline in holdings of U.S. government securities.
Lending by banks quickened in January, spurred substantially by
year-end acquisitions of nonrated industrial development bonds, classified
as loans to states and municipalities, and included in "all other loans" in
the table. Consumer loans advanced at an estimated 24 percent annual rate,
and security loans also increased sharply, but growth in real estate loans

moved down to an 8 percent rate and business loans expanded at only a 4
percent rate in January.
Business Finance
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses, though dropping below its year-
end pace, remained strong in January, with the bulk of the financing con-
tinuing to be concentrated in long-term markets. Businesses late last year
were taking advantage of lower long-term interest rates to lengthen the
maturity of their debt, a pattern that apparently carried over into January.
A persistent flood of share retirements also has kept longer-term business
borrowing high despite a relatively small margin of capital expenditures
over internally generated funds.
Short-term borrowing, in contrast, has weakened progressively
since November; the total of business loans at banks and commercial paper
was about unchanged in January. In addition, borrowing by state and local
authorities for the benefit of businesses dried up in January after an
enormous year-end surge to beat the effective date under proposed legis-
lation for new restraints on tax-exempt debt issuance.
Although offerings by nonfinancial corporations edged down during
January, total public offerings of taxable U.S. corporate bonds here and
abroad surpassed the very strong December volume. With the uptick in U.S.
rates early in the month, some activity shifted back to the Euromarket
where rate movements typically lag the domestic market. In addition to
a few large banks and insurance companies, the finance subsidiaries of
the auto companies tapped the Euromarkets in January.
In equity markets, broad stock price indexes have fluctuated con-
siderably, partly in sympathy with bond rates. Most recorded new highs in

December and again in early January, then climbed to still higher levels
in the first days of February. The upward movement of share prices in
December had helped to lift new equity issues to their largest monthly
volume of 1985; equity issues waned in mid-January when share prices dipped
temporarily, but still posted a fairly strong month.
Stock prices of S&Ls have been especially strong recently, increasing
about 19 percent since the beginning of the year, after an advance of nearly
90 percent in 1985. Most of the gains in S&L share prices last year occurred
in the fourth quarter as many institutions reported higher-than-expected
earnings and the outlook for interest rates was viewed favorably. Share
prices of energy concerns and banks with large foreign lending have moved
counter to the stock market as a whole recently, depressed mainly by oil
price developments; some large banks also posted relatively poor earnings.
The AMEX composite index, about one-fourth of which represents energy
firms, is down slightly from its level at the time of the last FOMC meeting
and nearly 4 percent from its January high.
Treasury and Federally Sponsored Agency Finance
The staff is projecting the federal government's combined deficit for
the current quarter to be about $65 billion, compared with $75 billion the
previous quarter. To help finance this deficit, the Treasury is expected
to borrow roughly $37 billion, net, and to draw down its cash balance by
about $22 billion.
The Treasury will raise about $41 billion, or more than the total
amount of net new money, in auctions of marketable coupon issues. An
important contribution to this volume will be $14-1/4 billion of net funds
raised in the mid-quarter financing, plus up to $1 billion in a special

foreign-targeted 10-year note, the fourth such Treasury issue. Because
it started the year with a large cash balance, the Treasury has reduced
the gross size of the regular weekly bill auctions, which resulted in the
beginning of a modest paydown in late January that will be augmented by a
runoff of cash management bills that mature this quarter. The Treasury's
total cash balance, and consequently its balance at Federal Reserve Banks,
reached an exceptionally high level last month as a result of record issu-
ance in December of nonmarketable securities to state and local govern-
ments, followed by sizable tax receipts in mid-January.1 The large and
rising cash balance has complicated reserve management and probably con-
tributed to some upward pressure on the federal funds rate.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies was curtailed
somewhat in the fourth quarter by a $1-1/4 billion paydown in debt by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Freddie Mac was able to reduce
its borrowing in the market last quarter because it sold back to the Fi-
nancial Corporation of America some of the mortgages it had purchased
when that troubled firm was unable to raise funds through regular market
channels. Agency borrowing may be slowing substantially further in the
current quarter, as the FHLBs and the Farm Credit Banks together reduced
their outstanding debt by about $3.0 billion in January.
Spreads between rates on sponsored-agency securities and on Treasury
securities have narrowed significantly in recent weeks. With the December
passage of the financial aid bill for the Farm Credit Banks reaffirming
1. The Treasury's total cash balance surged to a bit above $40 billion in
mid-January when auctions of 7-year notes and 20-year bonds settled. The
balance will be on a downtrend over most of the rest of the quarter, falling
to a low in early March in the neighborhood of $10 billion (the mid-quarter
financing will be largely offset by mid-quarter interest payments).

III-12
the government's commitment to the sponsored agencies, investors became
considerably less concerned about the credit quality of agency securities.
The most recently priced six-month security of the Farm Credit Banks had a
spread over Treasury securities of about 35 basis points; last fall, the
six-month Farm Credit security carried a premium of about 100 basis points;
nevertheless, current spreads on Farm Credit securities still are much
wider than those that existed before the financial problems of the Farm
Credit Banks became widely recognized. In contrast, spreads on the securi-
ties of the other sponsored agencies have returned to the margins that
existed before credit quality reemerged as an issue last year.
Tax-Exempt Market
The tax-exempt securities market has been characterized in recent
months by great uncertainty concerning prospects for tax reform legislation.
The primary questions center on what types of municipal bonds will lose their
tax-exempt status--and when--if a reform law is enacted. The House-passed
bill, for instance, has a retroactive effective date of January 1, 1986.
As a result of the uncertainties, offerings of municipal bonds totaled only
$2-1/2 billion in January, down dramatically from the frenetic average
monthly volume of nearly $30 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.
Virtually no private-purpose bonds were offered in January. The
House bill would place all private-purpose issues under a state-by-state
volume limitation that would constrain total offerings to just over $40
billion in 1986. Sales of these bonds totaled $62 billion in 1984 and,
boosted by anticipatory financings, may have reached $95 billion in 1985.
The proposed legislation leaves unclear which issuers could come to the
market under the tightened constraints.

III-13
Although public-purpose bonds would not be subject to volume
limits under the House bill, issuance of these bonds apparently has been
curtailed because of other restrictions in the bill; for example, issues
designed to earn arbitrage profits could be stripped of their tax-exempt
status. As a result, some offerings have been withdrawn. Others have been
accompanied by special legal "side opinions" assuring investors that the
issuer will take any necessary action to comply with the provisions of the
House bill. In addition, some market participants fear that a new, more
restrictive bill retaining the January 1, 1986, effective date may emerge
from the Senate.

The G.O. index is 52 basis points below its level in mid-December.
Mortgage Markets
Continuing the decline that began in early November, mortgage rates
in the primary market have edged down further on balance since the December
FOMC meeting. As a result, the nominal cost of home mortgage credit is
near its lowest level in seven years. Commitments for conventional 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages at savings and loans were available at contract rates
averaging a little less than 11 percent in late January. One-year adjustable-
rate mortgages at a subsample of these institutions were being offered at
initial rates of just under 9 percent.
The decline in mortgage interest rates during the fourth quarter con-
tributed to continued robust growth in mortgage debt. Preliminary figures
indicate an 11 percent annual rate of expansion for total (residential plus
nonresidential) mortgage debt, in line with the pace in each of the previous
several quarters. Partial data suggest continuation of this growth rate
into the new year.
Mortgage pooling remained vigorous during the fourth quarter, amounting
to one-half of the overall growth in residential mortgage debt. Issuance of
pass-through securities rose for the sixth consecutive quarter to a record
volume, and showed additional strength in January. Newly issued GNMAs have
been accounting for nearly half the total pass-through issuance. Origina-
tions of FHA/VA single-family loans--the bulk of which are sold into GNMA
pools--doubled their year-earlier volume in the second half of 1985, re-
sponding in part to tightened qualification standards in the conventional
market and increased private insurance premiums for high loan-to-value loans.

FHLMC and FNMA also issued large amounts of pass-throughs during the final
quarter of 1985. As has been the case for some time, most Freddie/Fannie
issues were swaps in which lenders trade their mortgages for FHLMC or FNMA
securities representing ownership shares in pools of the same loans.
The continuing popularity of the mortgage swap programs is attributable
in part to declining interest rates, which have made seasoned loans more
attractive assets to sell because many of them now trade at or above par.
Swaps are being used by mortgage holders to increase the market appeal of
these loans further by adding the credit enhancement of a guarantee by
Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. In addition, some mortgage bankers are swapping
mortgages for securities and then selling the securities, essentially using
the swap programs as alternatives to outright loan sales to the agencies.
A recent spur to swap activity has been a competition-induced reduction of
5 to 10 basis points in the fees charged by FNMA and FHLMC to guarantee
their securities.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit is estimated to have risen at a 13 percent
annual rate in December, a bit above the reduced November pace, and con-
tributing to a gain for the full year of just under 20 percent. Revolving
credit at commercial banks increased sharply in December, owing in part to
aggressive promotion of this type of lending. With bank lending to con-
sumers reportedly strong in January, and new reduced-rate financing programs
in place at the captive auto finance companies, consumer credit growth
likely quickened further in January.
Reflecting curtailment of incentive financing programs, total auto
credit growth slowed to an average annual rate of about 7 percent in

November and December, but the increase was 22 percent for the year as a
whole. The surge in auto debt last year was accompanied by a rise in car
loan delinquencies at the three captives from about 1.45 percent of the
number of loans outstanding in 1984-Q4 to about 1.85 percent in 1985-Q4;
however, the latest reading is well below earlier peaks and even below the
average of the past 20 years. Repossession rates edged up during 1985 but
also were quite low relative to the past.
After a round of incentive plans ended in early October, the average
interest rate charged on a new-car loan by the captive finance companies
rebounded sharply from 8.9 percent in September to 12.5 percent in December,
about where it was just prior to the late-August introduction of the programs.
More recently, these companies have reinstated concessionary finance rates
for cars that constitute about half their product line. The rate on a four-
year loan at commercial banks in November was 12.4 percent.
A secondary market in auto loans consisting of securities backed by
pools of seasoned loans began to develop during the past year. The first
issue of such certificates, by a large bond underwriter on behalf of a
commercial bank, was quite small and there were few further immediate moves
into the field. However, in December GMAC offered about $525 million in
certificates backed by a portfolio of its auto loans, and followed that with
another $425 million package in January. GMAC has been pricing these cer-
tificates, whose expected maturities are just under two years, at about
65 basis points above two-year Treasuries. It expects to offer about
$500 million each quarter.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting, the weighted-average foreign-exchange
value of the dollar has declined 2-1/2 percent, as depicted in Chart 1.
This move brought the dollar's cumulative decline since the G-5
announcement on September 22 to 12-1/2 percent. During the intermeeting
period, the dollar has displayed disparate movements against individual
foreign currencies -- shown in the lower panel of Chart 1 -- appreciat-
ing 3-1/2 percent in terms of sterling, while declining 4 percent and 5
percent against the mark and yen, respectively.
Changes in expectations about the likelihood of a U.S. or a
Japanese discount rate cut were the dominant factors influencing the
dollar during the intermeeting period. The dollar moved lower after
mid-December in association with further declines in U.S. long-term
interest rates as market participants reportedly assessed that U.S.
monetary conditions were easing and that the Federal Reserve would soon
lower its discount rate. The release in early January of stronger-than-
anticipated U.S. economic statistics for December dampened expectations
of a cut in the discount rate and the dollar firmed somewhat.
Meanwhile, statements by Bank of Japan Governor Sumita indicating that
he would like to see the yen stabilize, and a Japanese proposal that the
G-5 undertake a concerted reduction in interest rates bolstered
expectations of a cut in the Japanese discount rate. The Bank of Japan
did lower its discount rate from 5.0 to 4.5 percent, effective January
30; the action had been so widely anticipated, however, that it already
was incorporated in exchange rates. In late January, the dollar eased

somewhat as the tone of official statements shifted to indicate that a
further moderate depreciation in the dollar might be acceptable. In
addition, some market participants reportedly conjectured that the
Federal Reserve and, possibly, the Bundesbank would follow Japan's lead
and lower their discount rates.
With respect to individual foreign currencies, sterling
depreciated about 3-1/2 percent against the U.S. dollar during the
intermeeting period in response to falling oil prices. Since the last
FOMC, the price of North Sea Brent crude has dropped about $10, while
the British government has indicated that it is unwilling to restrict
production in concert with other oil-producing nations to shore up oil
prices. Sterling's decline was interrupted briefly during the week of
January 6 when the Bank of England boosted its money market dealing
rates by 1-1/8 percentage points to 12-1/2 percent to counter the
selling pressure on the pound.
Among the currencies of other major exporters of oil, the
Venezuelan bolivar has depreciated about 21 percent in terms of the U.S.
dollar during the intermeeting period. Despite the weakness in oil
prices, the Mexican peso has firmed somewhat against the dollar in
private markets, perhaps reflecting in part ongoing direct investment
inflows from international automobile manufacturers under previous
commitments, as well as continuing monetary restraint. The Norwegian
krone has eased somewhat against the major European currencies, although
it has appreciated vis-a-vis the dollar.
The Canadian dollar continued to weaken during the intermeeting
period, depreciating 3 percent further against the U.S. dollar. The

IV-4
downward pressure on the Canadian dollar has been attributed to three
factors; the perceived lack of progress in reducing the federal budget
deficit, the expectation of a continued deterioration in Canada's trade
and current account surpluses, and the assessment that domestic
financial markets are still fragile. Canadian monetary authorities have
responded by increasing central-bank lending
rates. Since the last FOMC meeting, Canadian short-term interest rates
have risen nearly 200 basis points.
Furthermore,
other measures were taken in support of the strained currencies.
Belgium and Ireland raised official money market lending rates and Italy
reinstituted credit and exchange controls and tightened monetary
conditions.
In commodity markets, the dollar price of gold spurted to about
$360 an ounce in mid-January in conjunction with increased tensions in
the Middle East following the freeze on Libyan assets in the United
States, official statements indicating that a coordinated reduction in
interest rates would be proposed at the G-5 meeting, and reports of
purchases of bullion by Japan to mint a commemorative coin. Since then,

IV-5
gold prices have retraced most of their rise and now stand at about $335
an ounce, as the drop in oil prices has led to a more favorable outlook
for inflation.

IV-6
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities were very large
during October and November, at a time when the foreign exchange value
of the dollar was declining. Net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds
totaled almost $13 billion and net purchases of U.S. Treasuries
were more than $5 billion. (See lines 2A and 3 of the Summary Table
of U.S. International Transactions.)
During October there were also substantial capital inflows
reported by banks which were only partially reversed in November.
(See line 1.) Over half the net bank inflow during the two months was
accounted for by a single U.S. bank owned by a foreign bank, which
substantially restructured its balance sheet by selling almost all its
claims on developing countries to its foreign parent. U.S. bank
claims on public borrowers and other nonbanks in Latin America fell as
a result of the asset sale, with a corresponding increase in exposure
on the books of foreign banks.
For the first eleven months of 1985 as a whole, the largest
increase in U.S. net capital flows occurred in the form of foreign
private purchases of U.S. corporate securities; these net purchases
totalled more than $40 billion and consisted almost entirely of
Eurobonds. Bank holding companies were heavy issuers, accounting for
about one-quarter of this total; the bulk of the bank issues were
floating rate notes. As several large banks approached ceilings on
the funds raised through the issue of mandatory convertible notes that
could be counted as capital for regulatory purposes, the volume of
new mandatory convertible notes fell from 1984 rates.

Almost $9 billion (about one-quarter) of the Eurobonds issued by
U.S. corporations in 1985 were foreign currency denominated or dual
currency, up sharply from 1984, when foreign currency issues were $3
billion (14 percent). While it is possible that this increase
reflects a shift in investor demand as a result of changing
expectations about the exchange value of the dollar, it is also likely
that, with the cost of hedging currency risk down on account of
broadened swap markets, U.S. corporations are becoming increasingly
willing to issue obligations not denominated in dollars. Virtually
all foreign currency issues by U.S. corporations in 1985 involved
swaps.
Information on the ultimate purchasers of Eurobonds issued by
U.S. corporations in 1985 is not available; the reporting system
usually indicates sales to the United Kingdom, the location of the
intermediaries underwriting the issues.
Net sales of U.S. Treasury securities to private foreigners in
the first eleven months of 1985 were at about the record rate reached
in 1984. Of the $20 billion purchased by private foreigners, $17
billion was purchased by Japanese residents, up from $4.5 billion in
1984. Treasury issues specially targeted for foreigners amounted to
only $1 billion of the total in 1985. Another specially targeted
issue of up to $1 billion was announced for February 5, 1986.
Bank reported inflows were also substantial in the first eleven
months of 1985, totalling almost $29 billion. (See line 1.) One
major factor in these net inflows was the contraction in bankers
acceptance business (BAs) done with foreign customers; many banks,
under pressure to improve capital adequacy, cut back on BAs and other

IV-9
assets with low profit margins. Data available through September
indicate that claims on foreigners declined by almost $7 billion as a
result of the decline in BAs outstanding. Another factor in the net
bank inflow was a $6 billion increase in liabilities to private
nonbanks, particularly from Latin America; at least a couple of
billion of this total probably represents the accumulation of interest
on existing deposits, rather than new capital flight. In addition
there were substantial net inflows from own foreign offices, reversing
the large outflow that had occurred on the last day of 1984.
In another bank-related development, loan sales by U.S. banks
to foreign banks expanded rapidly in 1985, and, because of reporting
gaps, probably contributed to the large positive statistical
discrepancy in the international accounts to the extent that foreign
banks booked these claims on U.S. residents outside the United States.
The rapid expansion of loan sales to foreign banks and the need for
increased funding when these loans were booked at U.S. offices also
probably was a factor in the increased borrowing of agencies and
branches of foreign banks from their related foreign offices during
1985. (See the International Banking Data table, line 3a).
Foreign official assets in the United States were virtually
unchanged in the first eleven months of 1985. A decline in holdings
of the OPEC countries ($7 billion) was almost matched by increases
elsewhere. Despite massive intervention sales of dollars by the G-10
countries in 1985, their holdings of official assets in the United
States increased somewhat in the first eleven months of 1985. U.S.
holdings of official reserve assets increased by almost $4 billion,
largely as the result of intervention purchases of foreign currencies
in October.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
The merchandise trade deficit rose in the fourth quarter and
brought the deficit for the year as a whole to a record level. The
staff estimates that on a revised international transactions basis
the fourth-quarter deficit was $145 billion, SAAR, and for 1985, the
deficit was nearly $125 billion. These data are subject to revision.
The value of exports increased slightly in the fourth quarter
from third-quarter levels. Agricultural exports picked up slightly,
supported by renewed shipments of corn to the Soviet Union and
increased exports of soybeans; U.S. exporters of soybeans were able
to take advantage of shortages of Brazilian soybeans and supply third
markets. For the year as a whole, the value of agricultural exports
dropped by about 25 percent (about half in price and half in volume).

Both the value and volume of nonagricultural exports in the
fourth quarter were at about the same level as recorded during the
other three quarters of the year. The effect of the strong dollar on
the price of U.S. goods offset the effect of a moderate rate of
economic expansion abroad. During the year gradual declines in
exports of machinery and industrial supplies were offset by small
increases in exports of automotive products to Canada, aircraft, and
other items.
Imports increased fairly strongly in the fourth quarter from the
third-quarter level. Much of the increase was in automotive
products, with notable increases also being recorded for consumer
goods, capital goods and oil imports. The rise in value of these
categories reflected higher prices as well as an increase in volume;
prices of various imported manufacturers began to turn up in the
second half of 1985. However, prices of industrial supplies and
foods (except coffee) declined steadily through December. It was
declining prices and a fairly flat volume of imports of these
intermediate commodities that offset some of the upward movement of
the imports of manufactured goods. Overall, the volume of nonoil
imports in the fourth quarter of 1985 was about 7 percent higher than
at the end of 1984; notwithstanding the recent rise in import prices
of manufactured goods, nonoil import prices on average were no higher
at the end of 1985 than at the end of 1984.
Oil imports in the fourth quarter rose in both price and volume
(see the table below). The higher price of oil imports reflected the
rise in world oil prices over the second half of last year. Since

IV-13
mid-December, spot prices for crude oil and petroleum products
declined sharply, primarily as a result of an increase in Saudi
Arabian production and a run-down in Saudi Arabian stocks. Iraq also
increased sales. The price of North Sea crude oil, measured by the
price of Brent blend crude, declined about $10 per barrel, and is now
below $17 per barrel. In the United States, the price of a marginal
barrel of crude oil, measured by the price of West Texas Intermediate
crude, dropped about $11 per barrel. The decline in prices of
petroleum products is reflected in changes in the netback prices of
Saudi Arabian and Nigerian light crude oil, which declined by about
$6 per barrel from mid-December to the end of January. The netback
price is a calculation whereby the value of crude oil is imputed from
the spot price of refined products.

Economic Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic growth in the major foreign industrial countries remains
moderate. Although growth in Japan has declined, economic activity in
Germany and Canada continues to show signs of strength. Industrial
production increased recently in France and Italy, but remains fairly
weak. In the United Kingdom, industrial production has continued to
grow. Inflation abroad generally continues to be moderate and has
declined recently in France and the United Kingdom. Both Japan and
Germany have consumer price inflation rates near 2 percent, while
inflation in Canada and Italy has been somewhat higher. Meanwhile, 1985
trade and current account data showed record surpluses in both Japan
and Germany through December, and the current account surplus widened in
the United Kingdom. The trade surplus in Canada has declined while
trade deficits in France and Italy have increased in the latest month
for which there were data.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, industrial production rose 0.7
percent (s.a.) in December after a decline of 1.1 percent the month
before. Industrial production in the fourth quarter of 1985 was only
1.2 percent above its year-earlier level, a substantial slowing of
growth from 1984. Retail sales increased 0.5 percent (s.a.) in
December, although retail sales growth declined in the fourth quarter as
a whole. New housing starts rose for the fourth consecutive month in
December after falling in the five preceding months. New housing starts
in 1985 were 4.2 percent above their year-earlier level.
The Tokyo consumer price index rose 1.6 percent during the twelve
months ending in January, down from last year's inflation of 2.2 percent.

IV-18
Japan's external surplus continued at record levels. For the calendar
year 1985 the cumulative trade surplus was $56 billion compared to $44
billion in 1984.
As part of its effort to stimulate domestic demand, and in light of
the recent strenghtening of the yen, the Bank of Japan cut its discount
rate from 5 percent to 4-1/2 percent effective January 30. Recent data
indicate that Japanese monetary growth exceeded somewhat the Bank of
Japan's projected growth of 8 -8.9 percent during the fourth quarter of
last year. According to the Bank of Japan, this increase resulted from
special factors, including porfolio shifts into recently liberalized
large-denomination time deposits and a surge in corporate borrowing
ahead of the December hike in the long-term prime lending rate. The
rise in Japanese interest rates has since been largely reversed.
According to official reports, the budget proposal for FY 1986,
unveiled in late December, will result in a reduction in the budget
deficit in FY 1986 to 3.2 percent of GNP, from 3.7 percent last year.
The budget provides for a 3 percent increase in General Account budget
expenditures. Government expenditures net of debt service payments and
local government revenue sharing will actually decline 1.2 billion yen.
The Fiscal Investment and Loan Program, which is separate from the
General Account Budget, is somewhat more expansionary, with planned
increases of 6.2 percent in FY 1986 compared with a 1.2 percent decline
in FY 1985. Taken together, the two budgets represent a slight degree
of fiscal stimulus. No major tax reductions are planned for 1986.
Real GNP in Germany grew 2.5 percent in 1985, according to
preliminary estimates. Growth in the fourth quarter implied by these

IV-19
estimates was about 4 percent (a.r.). Industrial production in the
fourth quarter of last year was 3.7 percent above year-earlier levels.
Production growth was especially strong in the capital goods sector,
while the construction sector finished last year well below its level in
late 1984. The unemployment rate remained at 9.2 percent (s.a.) in
January, only slightly below the average rate of 9.3 percent for 1985.
Employment increased slightly last year, and the number of unemployed
declined.
The consumer price index in January was 1.4 percent above last
year's index. For the year as a whole, the CPI rose 2.3 percent in 1985.
Unit wage costs remained virtually constant in 1985. Import prices at
year-end were 6.5 percent below their year-earlier levels. Wholesale
and producers prices were essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the current
account surplus for 1985 was $13.9 billion, compared with $5.8 billion
in 1984. The trade surplus in 1985 was $25.3 billion, following a
surplus of $18.8 billion in 1984.
The pace of economic activity in France has increased in recent
months. Industrial production rose by 2.2 percent (s.a.) in November
following a 0.8 percent rise in October. On a year-over-year basis,
industrial production showed an increase of 3.8 percent. The
unemployment rate eased further in December to 10.1 percent (s.a.), 1/2
percentage point below its level in August.
Inflation has continued to decline. Consumer prices increased by
only 0.1 percent (n.s.a.) in December. The year-over-year inflation
rate eased to 4.7 percent, only slightly above the government's 4-1/2
percent inflation target for the year. Wholesale prices decreased by

IV-20
0.3 percent (n.s.a.) in December, their seventh consecutive monthly
decline. On a year-over-year basis, wholesale prices were down by 1.8
percent.
The trade deficit in December increased to $450 million (s.a.).
For 1985 as a whole, the trade deficit was $2.6 billion, about unchanged
from the previous year. Preliminary data suggest that the 1985 current
account will show a small surplus following a small deficit in 1984.
Real GDP (average measure) in the United Kingdom fell 1.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, largely reflecting a drop in real
exports. More recent data on industrial production, however, suggest
that this decline was only a temporary interruption in U.K. growth.
After declining in mid-summer, the index of industrial production rose
3.2 percent (s.a.) during the three months ending in November to a level
7.1 percent above its year-earlier level.
Consumer price inflation in the United Kingdom has continued to
decline. Retail prices rose only 0.6 percent (n.s.a.) between June and
December, and at year end the twelve-month inflation rate was 5.7
percent. Nominal wage growth, however, continues to outpace price
inflation; in November the twelve-month increase in average earnings was
8.6 percent. The U.K. trade and current accounts were in surplus in
December, with the monthly current account surplus widening to $1
billion (s.a.). The trade deficit fell to $2.5 billion in 1985, from
$5.7 billion in 1984. The current account surplus in 1985 tripled to
$4.9 billion.
Gross domestic product in Canada increased 0.7 percent (s.a.) in
November continuing the relatively strong growth shown throughout the

IV-21
year. Industrial production also increased 0.8 percent (s.a.) in
November. The unemployment rate dropped to 10 percent in December, the
lowest rate since April 1982, and nearly 3 percentage points below the
peak reached in December 1982.
Inflation in Canada continued at a moderate pace. Consumer prices
increased 0.5 percent in December and the twelve-month inflation rate
rose slightly to 4.4 percent. The industry selling price increased 0.2
percent in November, bringing the twelve-month inflation rate in
wholesale prices to 2.5 percent. Meanwhile, Canada's trade surplus
dropped to $363 million in November from $1.2 billion in October.
Exports dropped 8.5 percent while imports reached a new record level,
growing nearly 9 percent. For the first 11 months, Canada's trade
surplus stood at $11.7 billion compared with last year's $14.8 billion.
GDP in Italy rose 0.8 percent (s.a.a.r) in the third quarter of
1985, to a level 1.3 percent above its year-earlier level. In October
and November, industrial production rose on average 0.5 percent
(s.a.a.r.) to a level 1.4 percent above its average year-earlier level.
Official government surveys conducted in October and November showed
consumers' confidence at a fairly high level by the standards of the
last three years.
The consumer price index rose .7 percent (s.a.) in December,
bringing the twelve-month inflation rate to 8.6 percent. The wholesale
price index rose .1 percent (s.a.) in November, resulting in a
twelve-month inflation rate of 5.8 percent. The trade account showed a
deficit of $1.7 billion in November. The deficit during the eleven

IV-22
months ending in November totalled $10.1 billion, about equal to the
deficit over the comparable period last year.
On January 16, Treasury Minister Goria announced three measures
designed to stem a large outflow of capital which began in December and
January and that was associated with pressures on the exchange value of
the lira. These measures were an effective increase in the yield on
short-term securities, an imposition of a lira deposit requirement
against exporters' receipts of foreign exchange, and a re-introduction
of a ceiling on the growth of commercial bank credit. Goria said that a
lack of faith in the Italian economy had caused an outflow of reserves
of foreign exchange and these measures were meant expressly to
discourage this outflow.

IV-23
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries. By the end of
January 1986, oil exporting developing countries had seen the dollar
price for their oil exports drop by about 20 percent from the average
level of 1985. Among heavily indebted countries, Mexico and Nigeria
will be hardest hit. At current prices, Mexico's oil export earnings
would tend to fall by $2.4 billion from last year, while the drop in
public sector revenues would lead to a loss of fiscal revenue of about 2
percent of GDP. Even at maximum production, the recent drop in oil
prices would tend to reduce Nigeria's oil export receipts from about
$11.3 billion in 1985 to about $9.5 billion in 1986. On December 31,
Nigeria's president indicated that debt service payments in 1986 would
be limited to no more than 30 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange
budget. However, even at current world oil prices, this limit would
permit Nigeria to meet fully its current interest obligations in 1986.
Venezuela's current account surplus would tend to decline by about $3
billion at current prices, but a small current account surplus would
remain, and, with international reserves of $16 billion, the country
could aborsb the effects of the decline in oil prices. Most of the
other major developing countries will benefit from lower oil prices this
year. Brazil is still a significant oil importer, but will also have to
reconsider its longer-term domestic program for the production of
alcohol and other high-cost substitutes for petroleum products.
Moderate benefits are also expected in the Philippines where the economy
remains generally depressed.
Individual Country Notes. Declining oil prices are cutting sharply
into Mexico's export earnings and public sector revenues, leading to

IV-24
increased needs for external and domestic financing. Mexico's $4
billion current account surplus of 1984 disappeared in 1985 as peso
overvaluation and domestic economic expansion in the first half of 1985
stimulated imports and impeded non-oil exports. Oil export earnings in
1985 were about $2 billion lower than in 1984, partly because the
government acted slowly in reducing prices as the market weakened,
triggering a temporary decline in the volume exported. At current
prices and production levels, oil export earnings would fall a further
$2.4 billion, while fiscal revenues would drop by about 2 percent of GDP.
The lower oil earnings last year were offset by an easing of world
interest rates and the lowering of spreads under the multi-year debt
restructuring agreement. In 1985, the public sector deficit was 8.4
percent of GDP, 4.3 percentage points higher than the 4.1 percent target
under the IMF program. The ballooning deficit stemmed from declining
oil revenues (0.7 percent), higher-than-expected interest payments on
the domestic debt (2.5 percent), and overspending in other areas (1.1
percent). Since last July, a substantial depreciation of the peso in
real terms has been achieved, and the government has proposed a more
austere budget. Prior to the recent drop in oil prices, Mexico had been
seeking net new external financing for 1986 of $4 billion (of which $2.5
billion was to have been provided by commercial banks), to finance the
1986 current account deficit, to rebuild international reserves (which
declined by about $2.5 billion in 1985), and to cover some private
capital outflows. In light of recent oil price developments, Mexico's
financing requirements will be higher. Negotiations with the IMF on a
1986 program have begun, and negotiations with the IBRD on an expanded

IV-25
borrowing program in support of specific structural reforms, starting
with trade policy, are nearing completion.
On December 12, 1985, Nigeria announced that an IMF loan would not
be sought, and that the measures contained in the 1986 budget plan would
constitute a self-imposed stabilization plan. In his New Year's budget
speech, the President announced measures to increase net revenues,
including a sharp increase in unrealistically low domestic petroleum
prices (which is expected to raise revenue equal to 1.5 percent of GDP),
an additional levy of 30 percent on all categories of imports, and a
reduction in subsidies to parastatals. Other budget measures are
designed to encourage non-oil exports by providing import duty rebates
on the raw materials and components used in the manufacture of exports,
preferential import licenses for export activities, and retention for
own-use of 25 percent of foreign exchange earnings by non-oil exporters.
For 1986, the President stated that external debt service would be
limited to 30 percent of the foreign exchange budget, which--at about
$2.9 billion--would be sufficient to finance Nigeria's current interest
obligations, but which is far less than the $5-6 billion of total
debt-service payments scheduled for 1986. In 1985, Nigeria's oil export
revenue amounted to $11.3 billion and, at current prices and levels of
production, would total about $9.5 billion in 1986.
Argentina is virtually self-sufficient in petroleum and will derive
only minor indirect benefits from world oil price declines. The
Argentine anti-inflationary program adopted last June has brought about
a deepening of the recession that started in late 1984 and a decline in
inflation. Consumer prices in the last five months of the year rose at

IV-26
an annual rate of 35 percent, almost as low as the monthly rate of
increase recorded last June. Real GDP in the third quarter was 5
percent below a year earlier. The economic slowdown was accompanied by
a decline in imports. In 1985, a $400 million decline in imports and a
$400 million decrease in external interest payments were the main reason
why the current account deficit narrowed by about $1 billion, to about
$1.5 billion. Severe flooding in the main grain growing areas last
November will lower 1986 export earnings by an estimated $500 million.
The anti-inflationary program has achieved a considerable reduction in
the public sector deficit and some reduction in central bank losses.
But deviations from the IMF program occurred beginning in September and
scheduled disbursements from the IMF and the commercial banks totaling
about $2 billion cannot take place until an IMF waiver is granted.
Brazil met with its bank advisory committee in mid-January and made
substantial progress toward an interim arrangement that would reschedule
1985 maturities and rollover 1986 maturities, as well as maintain
short-term credit lines. Another meeting is scheduled for February 5
with the goal of reaching agreement by March 15. Externally, Brazil
continues to run large trade surpluses in excess of $12 billion and is
likely to continue to do so in 1986. A serious drought in Brazil will
have effects that are largely offsetting with regard to the trade
balance. Higher coffee export revenues from higher coffee prices and
sales out of inventories should offset to a large extent higher grain
imports. Brazil will also benefit from lower oil prices. Internally,
inflation has accelerated, with consumer prices in January 1986 rising

IV-27
by a record 16.2 percent to a level 238 percent higher than in January
1985.
Although Peru continues to accumulate arrears to both commercial
banks and the IMF, Peruvian officials have recently indicated that Peru
may be considering a more conciliatory and flexible approach in its
relations with its external creditors. Peru recently made a small
payment of SDR 1.7 million against its arrears to the IMF--its first
payment to the Fund since early September--but Peru still has arrears to
the IMF of more than SDR 65 million. Peruvian officials in January also
indicated, for the first time, that Peru may be willing to accept an IMF
team visit for what is normally an annual review of the country's
economic policies and prospects, viz., the Article IV consultation.
Peru's interest arrears to commercial banks are about $400 million, are
growing by about $28 million a month, and--according to a government
announcement on February 2--new interest rate ceilings have been set on
short-term working capital debts of 1-1/4 percentage points above LIBOR
and 1 percentage point over prime.
Petroleum accounts for only about 10 percent of Colombia's exports,
while coffee accounts for about one half. Thus, the effect on Colombian
exports of the current weakness of oil prices is being more than offset
in the short run by the sharp strengthening of coffee prices during
December and January. A large increase in receipts from coffee exports
is expected to provide Colombia with foreign exchange to add to reserves
and to amortize external debt (possibly ahead of schedule).
The domestic economic outlook for Venezuela has again weakened in

95 percent of its export revenue. Assuming an export level of 1.4
million barrels per day and continuation of recent oil prices, oil
export earnings would drop about $2.3 billion from their $14 billion
level in 1985. However, with international reserves of $15.8 billion
(including gold holdings), Venezuela initially could absorb the effects
of the decline in oil prices. Venezuela is expected to sign at long
last the agreement to reschedule $21.2 billion of its external public
sector debt the week of February 24, 1986.
The IMF Board on December 20, 1985, approved the completion by the
Philippines of the Second Review of the 18-month December 1984 stand-by
arrangement. This allowed the Philippines to draw the third and fourth
tranches of the arrangement (totaling SDR 212 million) on December 27
and cleared the way for the second disbursement on January 8, 1986, of
$175 million from the commercial banks' $925 million new money
loan--$400 million having been disbursed earlier in August. On January
10, 1986, the Philippines signed a rescheduling agreement for $2.9
billion in external debt to commercial banks owed by seven public sector
institutions, out of some $5.8 billion in external debt that is to be
rescheduled this year. While lower oil prices will be of some
assistance to the Philippine balance of payments and economy this year,
possibly reducing the imported oil costs by about 1 percent of GDP,
other major forces are expected to keep the economy depressed.
