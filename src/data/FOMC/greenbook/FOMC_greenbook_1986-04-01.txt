The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Incoming data suggest that the economy has expanded at a moderate
pace in early 1986. However, the performance of different sectors has
varied substantially, ranging from robust gains in housing to marked weakness
in some areas of business fixed investment. Price indexes have been pushed
down by the recent plunge in energy prices.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
After rising sharply late last year, industrial production levelled off
in January and declined an estimated 0.6 percent in February. Although
output was higher in February for automotive goods and business supplies,
production cutbacks were widespread for other items. In particular, petroleum
drilling activity was curtailed sharply in reaction to the collapse of oil
prices. In addition, production of business equipment and materials remained
sluggish. In sectors linked to housing activity-construction supplies and
household goods--the declines are likely to prove temporary, as increased
housing construction should boost demand in these categories. The
few available indicators of output in March are negative, with cutbacks
reported in motor vehicle assemblies, oil and gas well drilling, and steel
production.
The capacity utilization rate for total industry declined 0.6
percentage point in February to 80 percent. Apart from the automobile
industry, utilization rates in most major manufacturing industries were
down in February. Over the past year, the overall utilization rate has
generally fluctuated between 80 and 81 percent.

Employment and Unemployment
Aggregate labor demand has continued to expand in recent months,
despite some specific areas of weakness. Nonfarm payroll employment rose
225,000 in February, after a substantial increase during the preceding month.
Once again, hiring at retail trade and service establishments accounted for
the bulk of the increase. In manufacturing, however, employment fell
30,000 after four months of growth, and the factory workweek dropped 0.3 of
an hour from the very high levels posted at the turn of the year. Employment
in mining also declined, owing to depressed conditions in the oil and gas
industry. The number of construction jobs edged down in February after an
unusually strong increase associated with favorable weather in January;
however, the average increase in construction employment over this two-month
period remains robust.
In contrast to the employment gains reported in the payroll survey,
household employment fell almost 400,000 in February, and the civilian
unemployment rate rate jumped 0.6 percentage point to 7.3 percent after
having edged down since mid-1985. About half of the job decline in the
household survey reflects a sharp drop in agricultural employment, which is
not measured by the establishment data. The flooding in California apparently
was partly responsible for this decline. Unusually large increases in
unemployment also were evident in Texas and Illinois, which the Bureau of
Labor Statistics traced to weakness in oil and gas extraction and in some
areas of manufacturing.
Autos
Sales of domestic autos averaged 8.3 million units (annual rate)
during January and February, spurred by cut-rate financing programs.

Although sales in the first two months of the year were up sharply from
the fourth-quarter pace, they fell somewhat short of the robust rate of
production, further increasing the already high level of auto inventories.
Additional incentive programs were announced in late February. The new
incentives cover a wider range of models than the programs available
earlier this year, but, on balance, provide less generous financing
terms. Although these incentives are still in effect, sales declined to
an average 7.1 million unit annual rate during the first twenty days of
March. Assemblies also appear to have declined some in March, but at an
annual rate of about 8 million units, the reduced production level will
not put a dent in dealer inventories.
Sales of foreign cars remained at a 2.8 million unit annual rate in
February. During the first two months of the year, sales of Japanese cars
dropped below their strong fourth-quarter pace and are likely to remain
low in March owing mainly to the usual end-of-quota-year stock shortages.
Personal Income and Consumption
Gains in real disposable personal income appear to have strengthened
in recent months. Data on nominal income, which are available through
February, point to a small improvement in income growth, mainly because of
cost-of-living adjustments for transfer payments and the indexing of
personal tax brackets. The growth in nominal private wages and salaries
was about in line with the 1985 average pace. In real terms, however,
disposable income in January was 1/2 percent above the fourth-quarter
average and, in light of the decline in consumer prices in February,
apparently rose sharply further last month.

Apart from auto sales, consumer spending has been relatively sluggish
since the start of the year. Expenditures on goods other than motor vehicles
and gasoline and fuel oil have shown little net change in nominal terms
after rising appreciably at the end of 1985. Expenditures for gasoline and
oil, although off sharply in nominal terms, probably have been relatively
flat in real terms. Outlays for services, by contrast, have risen briskly
in recent months. Conumption growth overall has not kept pace with income
gains and the personal saving rate has risen a bit from the unusually low
levels of last fall.
The latest consumer surveys conducted by the Michigan Survey
Research Center and the Conference Board continue to show an optimistic
household sector. An exceptionally large proportion of consumers viewed this
as a good time to buy autos and homes, and they expressed relatively little
concern about current debt burdens. Inflation expectations also have
declined, as the average rate of price increase expected over the next year
by respondents to the Michigan survey fell 1/2 percentage point in February
to 3.7 percent.
Business Fixed Investment
Spending for business equipment weakened in early 1986 after
having surged at the end of last year. Shipments of nondefense capital
goods from domestic producers, although up 5 percent in February, remained
well below the fourth-quarter average. Sales of heavy trucks also have
dropped markedly from their December peak. Part of the decline in

drilling structures) fell 0.8 percent in January, but remained 2-1/2 percent
above the fourth-quarter average-buoyed mainly by robust activity in the
commercial sector. In contrast, petroleum drilling activity--which accounts
for one-quarter of total spending for nonresidential structures in real
terms--apparently plummeted this quarter. Although no first-quarter data
are yet available for drilling footage (the primary series on which BEA
bases its estimate of spending for petroleum drilling structures), the
number of drilling rigs in use has dropped precipitously since December.
With regard to indicators of future investment spending, new orders
for nondefense capital goods rebounded substantially in February, to a
level moderately above the fourth-quarter average. In contrast, growth in
new commitments for nonresidential construction has slowed in the past
year, suggesting a limited scope for near-term spending gains in this area.
Looking at spending plans for 1986 as a whole, the McGraw-Hill survey--
conducted in January and February--indicated that businesses expect to
increase nominal outlays 3.4 percent over the 1985 level, an upward revision
of 4-1/2 percentage points from the previous McGraw-Hill survey. Since the
most recent McGraw-Hill survey was taken, a number of oil companies have
announced substantial cuts in their 1986 capital spending budgets; it is
not yet clear what offsets may be in train among industries benefiting from
lower energy costs.

Housing
Spurred by a rising trend of home sales and the recent decline in
interest rates, housing construction quickened in early 1986. Total private
starts in January and February averaged just over 2 million units at an
annual rate--well above the strong pace of late 1985. The increase was
concentrated in the single-family sector, while construction of multifamily
units remained at a relatively high level. The jump in starts in January
may have reflected, in part, unseasonably good weather, but February's 1.99
million unit annual rate provided evidence that construction has in fact
picked up considerably. Building permit issuance-a more stable indicator
of construction activity--also has been strong, with the average level in
January and February 6 percent above the fourth-quarter level.
Although the upturn in the single-family market was widely expected,
the continued strength in multifamily housing construction has been somewhat
surprising. Starts in this sector rose 11 percent in February, equalling
their highest level in two years. Market fundamentals do not appear to
warrant this high rate of apartment and condominium building; vacancy rates
for multifamily rental housing, for example, remained high in the fourth
quarter. However, activity in this sector probably is being supported
by the flood of tax-exempt housing bonds issued late last year in antici-
pation of adverse changes in the tax laws.
Sales of new single-family homes have been quite robust in recent
months, confirming the favorable attitudes toward homebuying expressed in
recent survey data. As demand has strengthened, price increases for both
new and existing homes have picked up a bit, although the recent monthly
estimates do not control for changing house quality and location. In the

1985--showed no surge in prices late last year (chart).
Business Inventories
Manufacturing and trade inventories moved in opposite directions
in the most recent months for which data are available. In January, factory
stocks continued the decline that began last spring while retail and
wholesale inventories surged at a $52 billion annual rate after a sizable
runup in the fourth quarter.
Manufacturers' stocks are currently quite lean by historical
standards. At the end of January, factory stocks in book value terms were
almost 2 percent below their most recent peak in March 1985, and the
inventory-shipments ratio was among the lowest observed over the current
expansion. Although the sector, on balance, appears to be positioned for
some restocking, efforts to build inventories appreciably probably will
depend on sustained improvement in new orders.
About one-third of the January accumulation in trade inventories was
in auto dealers' stocks, but there also were widespread increases in nonauto
inventories. For the past year, nonauto retailers have operated with
inventory-sales ratios that are relatively high by historical standards.
The recent accumulation in this sector keeps these ratios on the high side,
and near-term building of nonauto retail stocks is likely to be restrained.
Federal Government
Growth in total federal spending (unified budget) has abated in
recent months, but outlays over the first five months of the fiscal year
were up 5-3/4 percent from a year earlier, owing to large increases in
defense and agriculture spending duringg the latter part of 1985. Revenues

through February of this fiscal year have grown at about the same rate as
expenditures (table 1), even though receipts in February were depressed by
faster refund payments. The deficit was about 5-1/2 percent higher than
during the comparable period of FY1985.
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act began to restrain spending growth in
January (by rescinding the COLA for civilian and military retirement programs),
and its effect became more pronounced on March 1 when a sequester order,
designed to cut $10.6 billion from federal spending during the rest of this
fiscal year, went into effect. Although a federal District Court ruled in
early February that the procedure used to order a sequester is unconstitu-
tional, the ruling was stayed pending an appeal to the Supreme Court. A
final ruling is expected later this spring. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act
includes a fall-back procedure to order a sequester, which can be implemented
with legislative approval if the District court ruling is upheld.
A small downpayment on the deficit cuts required to attain the Gramm-
Rudman goals was made in the fiscal year 1986 Reconciliation Bill, which
Congress recently passed and sent to the President. The bill includes tax
increases and spending cuts that will reduce deficits relative to the current
services baseline figures by about $6 billion in each of the next three
years.1
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released downward-
revised estimates of the baseline federal deficit through 1991 (table 2).
1. The baseline deficit is computed under the assumption that taxes and
mandatory spending are continued at the rates specified in current laws,
and that discretionary programs are continued at levels that maintain real
program services.

The current projection of the baseline deficit is down sharply from estimates
produced as recently as last August for several reasons: the assumption of
lower interest rates has cut debt service costs, real defense spending is
now assumed to remain flat rather than to grow at a 3 percent annual rate,
and the Gramm-Rudman sequester and 1986 appropriations actions have
cut the base from which future spending increases are computed. The CBO
also has projected the size of the deficit under the President's budget
proposals. It projects substantially larger deficits than the Admini-
stration--$40 billion higher in 1991--primarily because the Administration
assumes somewhat lower interest rates in future years and expects smaller
outlays to result from current and proposed defense spending authority.
State and Local Sector
Spending prospects for state and local governments are being constrained
by a number of factors. Budget surpluses narrowed during 1985, and the
fiscal position of state and local governments in 1986 is further threatened
by expected cuts in federal grants. Moreover, states whose economies
depend on agriculture or oil and gas production face reduced revenues
because of depressed activity. As a result, many states anticipate revenue
shortfalls, and a good number already have taken steps to reduce significantly
future spending. Budget cuts made so far this year range up to 13 percent
of planned expenditures, with large reductions in Texas, Oklahoma, Idaho,
and Mississippi. Nonetheless, the financial picture is not uniformly
bleak; a number of states-especially those in New England and the mid-Atlantic
region--remain in good financial condition.

II-20
Prices
Declines in energy prices have dominated the latest price reports.
Led by a drop in gasoline and fuel oil prices, the consumer price index
for all urban consumers was down 0.4 percent in February--the first
decline in more than three years. Apart from energy, prices so far this
year at the consumer level have fallen a bit for food and have risen
moderately for other goods and services. Prices at the producer level also
reflect tumbling energy prices, with the PPI for finished goods
falling a record 1.6 percent in February.
Crude oil prices, which plunged 20 percent in the February PPI, have
come down substantially more since then. Refinery prices of petroleum
products also fell sharply in February, and retail prices of gasoline and
fuel oil were down about 6 percent and 11 percent, respectively, in the
February CPI. Further large declines in the CPI's components for gasoline
and fuel oil can be expected in coming months as the declines in crude oil
costs continue to be passed on to consumers.
Consumer food prices also have turned down after their brief pickup
late last year. Also, prices of crude foods--notably for livestock--declined
by substantial amounts during these two months, indicating little likelihood
of upward pressures in the near term.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose 0.2 percent in February,
a bit slower than the average pace during the past year. The PPI has been
little changed so far this year for both capital equipment and consumer
goods (excluding food and energy items). At earlier stages of processing,
prices of intermediate materials have continued to be essentially flat,
while prices for crude materials have declined.

Wage and Labor Costs
Wage inflation in the private economy has shown little change over
the past year. The hourly earnings index for production and nonsupervisory
workers rose 0.6 percent in February after a decline the month before.
Although volatile on a monthly basis, the 12-month change in this measure
has fluctuated around the 3 percent mark for well over a year.
Revised figures indicate that productivity in the nonfarm business
sector fell more than 3 percent at an annual rate during the fourth
quarter of 1985 as the sizable increase in employment and hours was not
matched by large production gains. In general, productivity performance
was poor in 1985; over the four quarters of last year, output per hour
fell about 1/2 percent. As a result, unit labor costs increased more
than 4 percent last year--up from the 3 percent rise in 1984--despite
continued moderate increases in hourly compensation.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Financial markets rallied over the intermeeting period, with most
interest rates falling to levels last seen in 1977 or 1978 and share prices
soaring to new highs. The declines of one-half to three-fourths percentage
point in short-term interest rates clearly owed much to anticipation and
enactment of the March 7 cut in the discount rate from 7-1/2 to 7 percent,
but less readily explained was the continued spectacular surge in long-term
securities prices, which pushed yields on Treasury bonds down more than a
percentage point and lifted broad stock averages as much as 10 percent.
Investors apparently were viewing the further drop in oil prices as improving
the chances of longer-range restraint on inflation; however, the evident
rise in stock price-earnings multiples and the depreciation of the dollar
suggest that the decline in bond yields reflected a shrinkage in real rates
as well as in inflation premiums. Projections of favorable budgetary
trends, less robust domestic economic indicators, and increased optimism
about the potential for easing steps by monetary authorities here and
abroad all contributed to the bullish sentiment in the fixed-income markets.
M1 growth picked up in February and appears to have strengthened
appreciably further in March, evidently lifting the aggregate above the top
of its 1986 target range. For M2, expansion remained anemic in February,
and although somewhat faster growth likely occurred in March, this aggregate
remains low relative to its 1986 range. M3, in contrast, has remained well
within its longer-run target range.
The overall rate of debt expansion by domestic nonfinancial sectors
has moderated substantially from the record fourth-quarter pace. Much of
the slowing stems from the reduced volume of tax-exempt bond issuance;

although there has been some rise in municipal offerings since January,
uncertainties about tax reform have continued to weigh on the market.
Along with reduced state and local borrowing, the federal government has
been able to cut back its offerings this quarter, in part by running down
its cash balance, which was swollen late last year by sales of special
securities to state and local units that had undertaken advance refundings.
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses has diminished, too; external
financing needs remain light, and the volume of share retirements has fallen
off. Gross corporate bond issuance has skyrocketed, as many firms have
seen in this market rally a long-awaited opportunity to lengthen debt
maturities at acceptable rates. Business loans and nonfinancial commercial
paper have been about flat since December.
Households also have been taking advantage of lower interest rates.
Fragmentary information suggests that net residential mortgage borrowing
has picked up further; refinancing activity has been heavy and should permit
many households to reduce their monthly payment burdens. Consumer install-
ment credit strengthened in January, boosted by reduced-rate lending by the
auto finance companies, although the underlying trend for consumer debt
seems to be one of gradual deceleration.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 growth rebounded to a 7-1/4 percent annual rate in February, and
weekly data through mid-March point to a further step-up in the rate of
expansion. The acceleration since January has largely reflected a renewed
rise in demand deposits after the January runoff. Growth in other check-
able deposits also picked up in February and appears to have expanded nearly
as fast in March; so far this year, though, expansion in OCDs has been below

III-4
last year's brisk pace. The January deregulation of NOW accounts seems to
have had little effect, with depository institutions generally not liber-
alizing the terms of their NOWs.
Owing primarily to the acceleration in M1, M2 growth edged up in
February, but only to a 3-1/2 percent annual rate. Growth of retail
deposits again was rather weak, even though sluggish downward adjustment
of offering rates on such accounts resulted in more favorable yields on
small time deposits relative to market instruments. In contrast, assets of
broker/dealer and general-purpose money market mutual funds recorded faster
growth in February and swelled further in the first half of March, as their
yields, too, lagged the decline in short-term market rates.
Although M2 likely has posted a somewhat larger increase in March, its
growth in recent months has been on a generally weak trajectory. Meanwhile,
inflows to stock and, especially, bond mutual funds have been very sizable
indeed, as savers have been attracted by the relatively high total returns
recorded--and aggressively advertised--by the funds.
M3 growth fell to a 6 percent annual rate in February, when bank
credit decelerated. Term RPs, along with overnight RPs, increased in
association with banks' acquisitions of Treasury securities, but net issuance
of other managed liabilities was off considerably. Bank CDs, which had
increased $12 billion in January, rose only about $2 billion last month,
and the sizable $6 billion inflow of funds from foreign offices in January
was partially reversed in February. Growth in M3 in early March seems to
be in line with the reduced February pace.
Bank credit growth slowed sharply in February, owing importantly to
the unwinding of heavy purchases of tax-exempt securities late last year.

III-5
While some of the investment in such securities had been motivated by the
desire to beat the year-end deadline for qualifying for carrying-cost
deductibility, a good part clearly was associated with an expectation of
capital gains when tax-exempt issuance abated-a strategy that proved
highly rewarding. From early January through mid-March, commercial banks
ran off an estimated $12 billion, net, of tax-exempts, more than offsetting
large acquisitions of U.S. government and agency securities.
Loan growth at commercial banks in February slowed markedly to a 4
percent annual rate. The slowing resulted from substantial reductions in
security loans and in loans to nonbank financial institutions, which have
been financing in long-term markets along with nonfinancial firms. Real
estate loans bounced back from relatively slow growth in January to a 14
percent increase in February; growth over the two months averaged about 11
percent, a shade below the average pace in recent quarters. Consumer loans
at banks continued to expand at a 12 percent pace in February.
Business loan demand remained weak at banks last month, reflecting
the limited credit requirements of firms and their preference for long-term
borrowing. The prime rate was cut one-half percentage point, but remains
well above other short-term rates. Outstanding commercial paper of nonfinan-
cial firms continued to run off, owing partly to refinancing of earlier
merger transactions.
Business Finance
While growth of short-term business debt has been very slow thus far
in 1986, nonfinancial businesses have increased sharply their gross issuance
of taxable bonds and stocks, taking advantage of rising securities prices.
An increased portion of new offerings has been used to refinance existing

long-term debt issued at higher yields; however, firms also have been
turning to the bond market when financing new capital needs.
Record volumes of new bonds have been issued in the domestic market,
with the first-quarter total expected to be roughly two-thirds higher than
the previous record set just last quarter. About half of the issuance
carried maturities of 20 years or longer--a considerably greater proportion
than in recent times, but not especially impressive by the standards of
earlier years. Offerings of lower-quality debt have been well maintained,
but the increase in volume has been primarily among investment-grade issues.
Issuance by nonfinancial corporations in the Euromarket has been
robust throughout the quarter. Though rates in domestic markets declined
more rapidly than those in the Euromarkets, some firms without existing
shelf-registered securities have taken advantage of easier issuing procedures
abroad. The dollar's depreciation and concerns among foreign investors
about the possible reinstatement of the withholding tax on foreign interest
earnings on new issues, as proposed in the Packwood tax plan, reportedly
have tempered the willingness of investors to acquire Eurobonds.
Prices in the stock market climbed to record highs in February and
again in March, prompting a pickup in new stock offerings. The rise in equity
issuance has been more noticeable among financial institutions, some of which
have benefited considerably from the decline in interest rates: prices of
New York City bank stocks moved up more than 20 percent over the intermeeting
period. Equity prices for some energy companies have declined in the midst
of the general market rally as a result of lower oil prices. Prices of
shares of real estate-related companies located in certain areas of the
country have also fallen as a result of excessive construction in those areas.

As stock prices generally have continued their sharp rise, announcements
of new merger proposals have dropped off noticeably. The rise in stock
prices also may be slowing company repurchases of their own stock, further
contributing to a smaller net retirement of stock than the extraordinary
amounts of last year.
Treasury and Federally Sponsored Agency Finance
The combined deficit of the federal government for the current quarter
is expected to be $63 billion. This will be financed in part by borrowing
roughly $36 billion, net, in the market and by drawing down the cash balance
by almost $19 billion. The cash balance had risen to an unusually high
level because of heavy sales of nonmarketable issues to state and local
governments in December.
For the quarter, the Treasury will have raised all of its new cash in
auctions of marketable coupon issues; there will have been a $7 billion net
paydown of bills. In the next three months the deficit is likely to decline
seasonally, and net borrowing is expected to be about $30 billion.1
Federally sponsored credit agencies, as a group, are paying down an
estimated $1-1/2 billion of debt in the first quarter. The largest decline
in net borrowings has been that of the Farm Credit Banks which continued
the paydowns that had been evident most of last year. This decline is
largely the result of weak demand for farm loans, because of overall weakness
in the farm sector and a tendency for the more able borrowers to obtain
funds from other sources that may have had lower rates.
1. The ceiling for bond issues with coupons in excess of 4-1/4 percent was
increased from $200 billion to $250 billion by congressional action on
March 20. This action was too late to permit the Treasury to include a
20-year bond in its end-of-quarter financing, as it normally would have
done, but it will permit normal financing patterns to resume thereafter.

Fannie Mae reduced its debt as its net purchases of mortgages slowed
sharply; the agency evidently has not offset fully the effect of increased
loan prepayments on the net growth of its asset portfolio. While outstanding
debt at Fannie Mae declined in the first quarter, its pass-through security
issuance was reported to be very heavy. In contrast to the situation at
Fannie Mae, mortgage refinancing has been boosting the borrowing of the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, which has risen to about $1-1/2
billion in the first quarter. As homeowners refinance, the gross issuance
of pass-through securities increases, and Freddie Mac must finance a portion
of these loans until a pool is formed that can be sold into the market as a
participation certificate. The Federal Home Loan Banks paid down debt in
the first two months of the year, owing to the seasonally weak demand for
advances to savings and loans; however, borrowing rebounded in March when
the demand for advances increased, apparently in connection with the higher
level of mortgage activity.
Tax-Exempt Market
Gross offerings of tax-exempt bonds rose somewhat in March from
depressed levels earlier this year, despite continued uncertainties about
tax reform. The gross volume of long-term securities totaled $3.1 billion
in February, and may more than double that rate in March. The recent
increases have been facilitated by pledges by the issuers of compliance
with tax-reform legislation passed late in 1985 by the House. However,
issuance could rise somewhat further, as the result of an agreement
reached in mid-March by key members of the Congress and Treasury
Secretary Baker to postpone several restrictions on public-purpose bonds

contained in the same bill.1 A proposal put forth by Senator Packwood on
March 19, to subject the interest earnings on all outstanding tax-exempt

market to a temporary halt, but the proposal was unanimously defeated in

1. Does not include .tax-exempt commercial paper.
2. Includes all refunding bonds, not just advance refundings.
3. Data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Virtually all of the municipal bonds sold thus far in 1986 have been
for public purposes. Refunding bonds have accounted for a large share of
the sales, owing primarily to the continued low level of rates. More than
half of the recent refundings have been sold by municipal utilities.
1. Certain restrictions on public-purpose bonds contained in H.R. 3838 were
postponed until September 1 or until a tax reform package is passed, whichever
comes first. In particular, restrictions on early issuance, including the
requirement that at least 5 percent of bond proceeds be spent within 30
days, have been relaxed. In addition, $25 million, or 25 percent, whichever
is less, of public-purpose bond proceeds can be used to benefit a private
concern under existing law, instead of the $10 million, or 10 percent,
proposed under the House bill.

III-13
The ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields has moved up substantially
in recent weeks. The relatively sluggish decline in municipal yields
likely reflects expectations of continued weak institutional demand, with
only spotty demand from casualty insurance companies and with commercial
banks out of the market entirely.
Strong demand for tax-exempt investments with relatively short maturities
is evident from the fact that tax-exempt money market mutual fund assets
have increased $10 billion, to $51 billion, since the beginning of January
and now make up 20 percent of all money fund assets. Purchases apparently
have comprised earlier issues for the most part, given the low volume of
short-term offerings so far this year.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates have continued to drop in the primary mortgage market
since the February FOMC meeting, reaching the lowest levels since 1978.
Commitment rates at savings and loan associations for conventional fixed-rate
loans on single-family homes have fallen nearly one percentage point, to
10.01 percent. The VA cut by one percentage point the ceiling rate on
mortgages that it guarantees, lowering the contract rate on level-payment
loans to 9-1/2 percent.
The proportion of fixed-rate financing has increased in the primary
market. At major lenders, the share of conventional home loans closed with
fixed rates rose to 62 percent in early February, the largest share in
2-1/2 years. By mid-March, the difference between commitment rates on
fixed-rate loans and on one-year adjustable-rate loans at S&Ls had dipped
below 1-1/2 percentage points, about 40 basis points narrower than a month

earlier and a full percentage point less than the spread last November,
reducing the attractiveness of ARMs to borrowers.
The drop in interest rates has precipitated a surge of mortgage
refinancings; they accounted for 18 percent of all VA-guaranteed home loans
closed in February, 3-1/3 times their frequency a year and a half earlier.
Refinancing activity also was up on FHA-insured loans; 25 percent of the
insurance applications processed in February involved refinancing of existing
mortgages, compared with an average of less than 14 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1985.1
Reflecting the increased refinancing activity, the pace at which
FHA/VA mortgages prepay in high-coupon GNMA pools has accelerated. For
example, during February, GNMAs with a coupon of 13-1/2 percent--issued
against pools of FHA and VA mortgages with contract rates of 14 percent--
attained a record rate of prepayment.2
The fall in interest rates since last autumn has spurred mortgage
acquisition activity at thrift institutions. The net change in mortgage
assets at FSLIC-insured entities rose to a seasonally adjusted $6.3 billion
in January, the strongest pace since September. The increase was concen-
trated in mortgage-backed securities, as many thrifts swapped seasoned
mortgages for pass-through securities. Swap issues by FHLMC and FNMA
1. Authority for FHA to issue mortgage commitments expired on March 17,
but a bill is expected to be signed shortly that would extend FHA authority
through April 30.
2. Some commercial mortgages and construction loans contain prepayment
penalties, which are prohibited on VA-guaranteed and FHA-insured residential
mortgages and on all conventional home mortgages in some states. There are
reports that even with these penalties some commercial borrowers have been
able to refinance their loans on favorable terms, indicating that refinancing
activity may be increasing for commercial as well as for home mortgages.

averaged $6.1 billion in January and February (NSA), up $1.5 billion from
the monthly average for the final quarter of last year.
GNMA gross security issuance also remained robust, stimulated in part
by the rush of refinancings of seasoned FHA/VA mortgages as well as by the
tighter underwriting standards currently employed on conventional mortgage
loans.
Consumer Installment Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit outstanding rebounded in January
to a 15-1/4 percent annual rate, boosted mainly by a resurgence in auto
credit that was sparked by another round of reduced-rate financing from the
automobile finance companies. Auto credit advanced at nearly an 18 percent
rate after gains averaging 7 percent in the prior two months. Revolving
credit growth also was strong in January. In total, however, credit growth
remained well below the peak rates of the current cycle.
Consumer installment credit expansion likely continued fairly strong
in February, as auto financing incentives remained in force through most
of the month, and retail sales of non-auto durable goods were relatively
strong. Available data suggest that consumer credit growth at banks in
February stayed at about the January pace, while data for large banks in
early March suggest a modest slowing.
A broad decline in interest rates on consumer loans appears to be in
process. At commercial banks, a gradual downtrend has been evident since
the fall of 1984. Between that time and February of this year, new-car
loan rates dropped 1-3/4 percentage points to 12-1/4 percent. In recent
days, a number of banks have announced cuts of 1/2 percentage point or more
on auto loans, home improvement loans, and most other types of consumer credit.

Various measures of debt payment problems have been suggesting
increased strains on households in the past several months. Delinquency
rates on closed-end loans at banks, though leveling off since about last
spring, have retraced half the decline from their previous cyclical peak,
and credit card delinquencies rose steadily throughout 1985. At the auto
finance companies, delinquencies also trended upward all year, and in the
home mortgage market major delinquency rate series were at or near historical
highs. Moreover, debt-troubled households resorted to personal bankruptcy
last year at an accelerating pace (see chart on page 111-20).

Foreign Exchange Markets
In the period since the last FOMC meeting, the trade-weighted
average foreign exchange value of the dollar initially registered
further sharp declines, but later rebounded, for a net decline of 2
percent. The dollar's weighted-average value now stands 15 percent
below its level preceding the G-5 announcement of last September and
about 28 percent below its peak in February 1985.
The dollar declined sharply in the first half of the intermeeting
period, as data on U.S. economic activity disappointed market
expectations and as the continued steep decline in crude oil prices
raised concern about the viability of U.S. banks with large exposures to
the energy sector and to oil-producing developing countries. Meanwhile,
statements by some G-5 officials gave market participants the impression
that policy would not be adjusted to lend support to the dollar.
The dollar steadied in early March when the central banks of
Germany, Japan, and the United States made coordinated cuts of 1/2
percentage point in their discount rates. The move perhaps alleviated
market concern that the Federal Reserve might act unilaterally.
Around mid-March, however, the dollar again weakened, especially
against the Japanese yen, which registered a new postwar high vis-a-vis
the dollar.
.In addition, the Japanese Ministry of Finance announced some
easing of restrictions on holdings of foreign securities at life

insurance companies. The dollar subsequently recovered a bit from its
lows.
Late in the intermeeting period, the dollar rose sharply when
Japanese officials said that they would take further action to stem
additional appreciation of the yen. They also alleged that the Federal
Reserve agreed the dollar's drop is complete. In this context, the
dollar appeared to derive some support from U.S. economic data
presenting a stronger picture than many market participants reportedly
expected.
The discount-rate cuts in Germany, Japan, and the United States
encouraged official rate reductions elsewhere. The central banks of the
Netherlands and France responded immediately to the Bundesbank's action
by reducing their official rates 1/2- and 1/4-percentage point,
respectively. Over the next two weeks, the central banks of Sweden and
Italy lowered their discount rates by 1 percentage point, and the Bank
of England reduced its money market dealing rates by that amount. As
pressures on the Canadian dollar diminished, the Bank of Canada let
short-term interest rates in Canadian markets back down as much as 2
percentage points. Market interest rates on both short- and long-term
instruments denominated in foreign currencies generally have declined
significantly since the last FOMC meeting. However, in most instances
the declines have been smaller than those on comparable dollar-
denominated assets.

U.S. bank lending to foreigners in the fourth quarter. In
nominal terms, U.S.-chartered banks' claims on foreigners were
virtually unchanged in the fourth quarter. After adjustment for the
effect of a 7 percent decline in the value of the dollar on the value
of nondollar claims, it appears that claims fell about $8 billion. For
the year 1985 as a whole, adjusted claims declined about $27 billion,
or 6 1/2 percent, of which about $21 billion represented the change in
dollar value resulting from the dollar's decline. The effect of the
exchange rate adjustment was greatest on claims with the largest
nondollar component, i.e., claims on the G-10, smaller developed, and
East European countries.
In the fourth quarter, a drop of $4-1/2 billion in claims on
the non-OPEC developing countries (unadjusted for exchange rate
changes) accounted for almost three-fourths of the entire 1985 decline
in claims on that group of borrowers. There were declines in the
fourth quarter of $0.2 to $1 billion in claims on each of the principal
Far Eastern and Southeast Asia borrowers, as well as Argentina and
Brazil. A partial explanation is that reported claims were reduced by
a sizeable sale of loans by a U.S. bank to its foreign parent bank.
The fourth-quarter declines in claims on the non-OPEC developing
countries and several other groups were approximately offset by
increases in claims on the G-10 countries and offshore banking centers.
For 1985 as a whole, the unadjusted changes in claims on
every group were small. For the non-OPEC developing countries, on which
claims fell $6 billion as a group, the principal changes were decreases

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Substantial net capital inflows, both official and private, were
recorded in January. (See the Summary Table of U.S. International
Transactions.) Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks (line 2B)
were strong in January, continuing the trend observed during the booming
stock markets of November and December. Foreign net purchases of U.S.
corporate bonds (line 2A) declined somewhat in January from the record
rate in the fourth quarter of 1985, reflecting a decline in new
Eurobonds issued by U.S. corporations at the end of the year (but with
payments dates in January).
Newly announced Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations were more than
$4 billion dollars a month in both January and February, still
relatively strong compared with the average monthly rate of $3 billion
in 1985, although down somewhat in February as a percentage of total new
issues by U.S. corporations (18 percent compared to 24 percent in
January and 1985 as a whole). In February, Amoco, following the
precedent set by the World Bank several months earlier, became the first
corporate borrower to issue a 30-year bond in the Euromarket. The Amoco
issue was linked to a domestic issue and offers investors the option to
resell the bonds in the United States in registered form. Both the
growing number of long-term issues in the Euromarket and the linking of
a domestic and Eurodollar issue indicate a blurring of the lines between
the U.S. and Eurodollar bond markets.
Private foreigners, particularly Japanese residents, sold U.S.
Treasury securities net in January, probably in response to the
narrowing of dollar-yen interest rate spreads since late October. On

March 18 Japan announced an easing of its regulations on the foreign
investments of life insurance companies, permitting some increase in
their holdings of U.S. securities. Life insurance companies may now
invest up to 25 percent of their assets in non-yen securities and
deposits, issued by either Japanese residents or foreigners. (There may
be additional informal constraints on the division between securities
and deposits and on the division between obligations of Japanese and
foreign issuers.) Previously life insurance companies were limited to
investing 10 percent in securities issued by foreigners, whatever the
currency denomination. Because the old regulations focused on the
residence of the issuer and not currency denomination, Japanese firms at
times could issue dollar bonds (so called Sushi bonds) at lower cost
than non-Japanese borrowers and benefit by engaging in yen-dollar swaps
with foreign residents.
Another change that might affect foreign demand for Eurobonds
issued by U.S. corporations is the possible reimposition of the
withholding tax on interest payments to foreigners, proposed in Senator
Packwood's tax-overhaul plan. Although the 5 percent tax, as currently
proposed, would apply only to securities issued after the tax package
is passed, the proposal has increased market uncertainty about the tax
status of outstanding bonds and might dampen current sales of Eurobonds
by U.S. corporations.
Bank-reported inflows were also large in January. Banks reported
about $12 billion in net inflows, about $10 billion of which consisted
of inflows from their own offices in foreign countries. More than $3
billion of this inflow reflected a decline in Eurodollar deposits of
bank holding companies. As shown on the International Banking Data

IV-10
table (line 3), these inflows were not reversed in February, and were
concentrated at U.S.-chartered banks. The net inflows were the product
of a decline in claims held by banks other than the 25 largest, and
probably reflect a further pullback by regional banks from the
Euro-interbank markets in response to slow growth of domestic core
deposits relative to loan demand.
Official reserve assets held in the United States increased by more
than $2 billion in January. The increase in OPEC assets in the United
States probably reflects higher Saudi Arabian export revenues due to
expanded oil production. The increase in G-10 assets in part reflects a
swap between the Bundesbank and German commercial banks, designed to
increase liquidity in DM-based money markets.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
Merchandise trade data are available on a preliminary,
unrevised and not seasonally adjusted basis for the month of January.
These data, which are subject to substantial revision, showed a trade
deficit in January of $197 billion at an annual rate (CIF value) that
was somewhat larger than in December and the fourth quarter (see the
table below). Exports in January were little changed from low December
levels and imports rose. Preliminary data for February will be
available on Thursday, March 27. Revised January data, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, will not be available until the middle of next week.
At the end of 1985, the merchandise trade deficit was at a
record level -- $158 billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter
(balance-of-payments basis). Exports were little changed from rates
recorded in the previous two quarters. A small upturn in agricultural

exports in the fourth quarter (renewed shipments to the Soviet Union)
was offset by declines in other items. The lagged effect of the strong
dollar on the price of U.S. goods in foreign markets continued to offset
the effect of a moderate rate of expansion abroad.
The increase of imports in the fourth quarter was particularly
large. While the rise in volume was widespread among the different
trade categories, the largest increases were in oil, consumer goods,
automotive products from Japan and Europe, and in capital goods. By
area (measured in value terms), nearly half of the rise in nonoil
imports in the fourth quarter was from Western Europe, with the rest of
the increase about evenly split between Canada and Japan. While nonoil
imports from Mexico increased slightly, imports from other developing
countries, particularly in Asia, declined a bit.
After recording declines or being unchanged for more than a
year, import prices of various manufactured goods turned up toward the
end of 1985, at least partly in a lagged response to the depreciation of
the dollar that began earlier in the year. However, prices of
industrial supplies and foods (except coffee) declined steadily through
the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding recent price rises, nonoil import
prices, on average, were no higher at the end of 1985 than at the end of
1984.
Oil imports continued to be affected by uncertainties in world
oil markets. The level of oil inventories was held relatively low
during much of 1985. In the fourth quarter, stocks of fuel oil were
replenished in anticipation of the winter heating season raising the
volume of oil imports. The price of imported oil was about 50 cents per
barrel higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter reflecting

IV-14
steadily rising world spot oil prices from June through November. Since
December, spot prices for crude oil and petroleum products dropped
sharply, by more than 50 percent, primarily as a result of an increase
in Saudi Arabian production and a run-down in Saudi Arabian stocks.
Iraq also increased its sales. OPEC members meeting from March 16-24

U.S. Current Account in 1985-Q4
The U.S. current account was in deficit by $146 billion at an
annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1985. This was a larger deficit
(by $29 billion at an annual rate) than in the third quarter. See the
table below.
Most of the increase in the deficit in the fourth quarter was
in merchandise trade (exports were little changed from third quarter
levels and imports rose). Net receipts from service transactions,
particularly portfolio income, also declined. Portfolio income
payments, net, were larger than in the third quarter (primarily because
the stock of U.S. liabilities to foreigners grew faster than the stock
of U.S. assets abroad). Changes in net income from direct investments
and from other services were relatively small.

Economic Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic growth continues at a moderate pace in the major
industrial economies. Economic activity appears to be slowing in Japan
but to remain relatively strong in Germany, despite contradictory
indications in fourth-quarter GNP data for both countries. In Canada,
the economic expansion continues at a brisk pace. Industrial production
increased recently in Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom, but
declined in Japan, France and Italy. Recent evidence on the prospects
for faster growth in France and Italy are mixed. Inflation abroad
remains quite low, with declines in oil prices and the dollar
reinforcing an underlying trend toward price stability. Consumer price
inflation over the most recent 12-month period is less than 1 percent in
Germany and about 2 percent in Japan, and has declined recently in
France and Italy.
Official lending rates were lowered in several foreign economies,
including Germany, Japan, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. The
1986/87 budget recently announced in the United Kingdom is broadly
neutral while the new Canadian budget is somewhat restrictive.
Most recent trade and current account data indicate continuing
record surpluses in Germany and Japan, while the United Kingdom and
France registered smaller external surpluses. In contrast, Canada and
Italy report trade and current account deficits, although the Canadian
external position has improved recently while the Italian position has
deteriorated.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, preliminary data indicate that
GNP grew 7.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter after increasing

at an upward-revised 3 percent rate in the third quarter. For 1985 as a
whole, real GNP grew 4.6 percent, down from the 5.1 percent increase in
1984. Domestic demand accounted for 3.6 of the 4.6 percentage point
increase in real GNP in 1985. Recent data on industrial production
suggest a continuation of the substantial slowing of the pace of output
growth which emerged in 1985. Industrial production fell by 0.7 percent
(s.a.) in January after rising by that amount in December, so that the
average level of the index for the three months ending in January is
just 0.9 percent above its year-earlier level. New machinery orders
slipped slightly in the fourth quarter of 1985, reflecting a substantial
decrease in orders placed by overseas buyers. Retail sales increased 5
percent (s.a.) in January after declining slightly in the two preceding
months, and new housing starts rose for the fifth consecutive month in
January. For 1985 as a whole, new housing starts were 4.1 percent above
their level for the preceding year, reflecting a strong recovery in the
fourth quarter due to lower mortgage lending rates and larger government
housing subsidies.
The Tokyo consumer price index rose 2.1 percent during the 12
months ending in February, up 0.5 percentage point from the equivalent
rate recorded in January. Japan's external surpluses continued at
record rates. In January, the current account surplus was $66 billion
(s.a.a.r.), little changed from its average level in the fourth quarter
of 1985.
As part of its ongoing efforts to stimulate domestic demand, and in
light of the continued strengthening of the yen, the Bank of Japan
lowered its discount rate from 4.5 percent to 4 percent, effective March

IV-21
10. This is the second discount rate reduction in two months and is the
lowest rate since March 1978.
Real GNP in Germany grew only 1.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth
quarter due to extra holidays and days off provided under reduced work
time agreements for metal and automobile workers. Industrial production
rose sharply in January to 4-1/4 percent above its year-earlier level.
Reflecting the general shift in demand last year, new foreign
manufacturing orders in January were below last year's level, while
domestic manufacturing orders rose by 3 percent. Growth in employment
continued to rise throughout last year, but offsetting increases in the
labor force have so far kept the rate of unemployment near last year's
average rate of slightly more than 9 percent.
Consumer prices have barely risen in the ten months through
February, when they were 0.7 percent above the February 1985 level.
Wholesale and import prices are now substantially below their
year-earlier levels.
The trade and current account surpluses for January, totaling $34.8
billion and $16.8 billion (n.s.a., annual rates), respectively, were by
far the largest January figures ever, reflecting mainly the fall in
import prices in general and in the oil price in particular.
The growth of Central Bank Money (CBM) slowed in February, but
the average growth rate for January and February of over 7 percent was
still above the 5.5 percent upper limit of the Bundesbank's target range
for the current year. Nevertheless, the Bundesbank lowered its discount
rate from 4 to 3.5 percent effective March 7.

IV-22
In France, recent evidence on the strength of real economic growth
has been mixed. Industrial production fell by 3.6 percent (s.a.) in
December and declined a further 0.8 percent in January, more than
reversing the 3 percent increase recorded over October and November. On
a year-over-year basis, however, industrial production in January was
still up 3.1 percent. Real GDP grew by 2.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
fourth quarter, and was 2 percent above its year-earlier level. The
sectors showing the greatest strength in the fourth quarter were
household consumption and exports. The unemployment rate remained
unchanged at 10.5 percent (s.a.) in February, increasing from 10.3
percent in January.
The inflation rate has continued to drop sharply under the
influence of falling oil prices and a lower franc/dollar exchange rate.
The consumer price index declined by 0.2 percent (n.s.a.) in February,
the first monthly decline in two decades. The year-over-year inflation
rate fell to 3.4 percent. The government is now forecasting an
inflation rate of under 2 percent by year-end.
The trade balance moved into surplus by $5.4 billion (s.a.a.r.) in
January. The current account was in surplus by $7.8 billion (s.a.a.r.)
in the fourth quarter. For 1985 as a whole, the current account surplus
totaled $500 million, the first yearly current account surplus since
1979.
As a result of the legislative elections held on March 16,
President Mitterrand's Socialist party lost its majority in the National
Assembly. Jacques Chirac, leader of the conservative coalition which
won a narrow majority of Assembly seats, has been appointed Prime

IV-23
Minister by President Mitterrand and has formed a new government.
Chirac has indicated that he will move quickly to implement the
conservative's economic program, which includes removal of price and
exchange controls and denationalization. Macroeconomic policies are
likely to remain mildly contractionary.
In the United Kingdom, real GDP (average measure) grew 2.2
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter of 1985 to a level 2.8 percent
above the year-earlier level. Industrial production, after declining
sharply in December, rose by 1.6 percent (s.a.) in January to about its
average level during the fourth quarter. Inflation continues to be
moderate. Retail prices rose only 0.4 percent (n.s.a.) in February,
lowering the 12-month inflation rate to 5.1 percent.
The February trade balance moved back into deficit following a
slight surplus in January. The current account surplus in February fell
to $0.5 billion (s.a.) from $1.6 billion in January.
On March 18, Chancellor Lawson presented the government's budget
for fiscal year 1986/87 (beginning April 1) to Parliament. The budget
calls for only small changes in tax measures and virtually no adjustment
to the already-announced plans to hold expenditures essentially
unchanged from the current fiscal year's levels. The basic rate in the
income tax code is to be lowered one percentage point to 29 percent.
Personal exemption figures are to be increased so as to remain unchanged
in real terms. Similarly, excise duties on tobacco, road fuels, and
some other goods will be raised slightly so that, on balance, excise tax
revenue will be constant in real terms. The system of gift and death
taxes will be radically changed, with gift taxes largely abolished but a

IV-24
revised system of inheritance taxes left in place. There are to be no
changes in corporate tax rates or depreciation allowances other than
those announced in previous budgets.
The tax changes and the previously-announced expenditure plans
imply a public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of £7 billion
(1-3/4 percent of GDP) for 1986/87. The PSBR outcome for the current
fiscal year is now estimated at about £7 billion (2 percent of a
lower level of GDP).
The budget contained new target ranges for money growth. The range
for growth in sterling M3, which refers to 12-month percentage changes,
has been raised to 11 to 15 percent from this year's range of 5 to 9
percent. The MO target range, similarly defined, will become 2 to 6
percent, slightly below this year's target of 3 to 7 percent. Through
February, growth was about 14 percent for sterling M3 and 3-1/2 percent for
MO. Following the budget announcement, the Bank of England lowered its
money market dealing rates by 1 percentage point. Major U.K. clearing
banks announced similar reductions in their base lending rates to 11.5
percent.
Economic expansion in Canada continued at a brisk pace for 1985 as a
whole. Real GNP increased 5.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter,
bringing the total rise to 4.9 percent in 1985. Despite relatively strong
growth in investment outlays by businesses in 1985, investment expenditures
for the year as a whole were still 10.5 percent below the peak rate reached
in 1981. Industrial production increased 0.7 percent (s.a.) in December,
following similar increases over the previous three months. Meanwhile, the
unemployment rate remained at 9.8 percent in February.

IV-25
Inflation has continued to be moderate in 1986. Consumer prices
rose 4.1 percent in the 12 months ending in February, about the same
percentage change as during 1985. In addition, Canada's industrial
product price index in January was only 2.9 percent above its
year-earlier level. Meanwhile, Canada's trade surplus in 1985 fell to
$12.2 billion after a record $15.7 billion in 1984. In January, the
trade surplus fell further to $9.9 billion (s.a.a.r.). The current
account deficit was about $1 billion (s.a.) in each of the third and
fourth quarters of 1985, bringing the current account deficit to $1.4
billion for the year as a whole.
The federal budget for FY 1986/87 was issued in late February
against a background of severe selling pressure on the Canadian dollar
and rising interest rates. The Mulroney government has been
persistently criticized for its inertia in dealing with the federal
deficit. The new budget will bring the federal deficit to C$29.5
billion in 1986/87 or 6 percent of GNP, down from 7.5 percent estimated
for FY 1985/86. Initiatives in the new budget are projected to reduce
the deficit about C$2.3 billion, mostly through tax increases, while
policies announced earlier will reduce the deficit an additional C$2.5
billion. New spending reductions result from a selective freeze on
government salaries, lower total subsidies paid owing to sales of
government corporations, management initiatives, and restraint in
foreign aid and defense spending. The major revenue-raising initiatives
are a 3 percent surtax on personal federal tax liabilities, an increase
of 1 percent in the federal sales tax, and increases in alcohol and

IV-26
tobacco taxes of 4 and 6 percentage points, respectively. Bond and
exchange market reactions to the budget have been negative.
Industrial production in Italy declined 4.1 percent (s.a.) in
December 1985. For 1985 as a whole, industrial production was 1.3
percent higher than in 1984. Nevertheless, the official government
surveys conducted in December, January and February show a general
increase in consumers' confidence to historically high levels.
The consumer price index (n.s.a.) rose 0.5 percent in January and
0.7 percent in February, bringing the 12-month inflation rate in
February to 7.6 percent. This rate of inflation in February was the
lowest in more than 13 years, as the energy price component of the index
dropped sharply. The trade deficit in January 1986 was a surprisingly
large $18 billion (s.a.a.r.), a sizable increase in the deficit relative
to the fourth quarter of 1985.
The 1986 budget was passed by Parliament on February 26. It will
result in an estimated Treasury borrowing requirement of 115 trillion
lire, equal to 15.8 percent of GDP, a decrease from this year's
estimated outcome of 16.3 percent. In a related action in late
February, Prime Minister Craxi approved higher taxes on gasoline and
diesel products. Instead of reducing administered oil price ceilings,
the Italian cabinet decided to increase taxes by the equivalent amount
of the oil price drop. The Italian authorities lowered the discount
rate from 14 to 15 percent on March 21.

IV-27
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries. Since the last
Greenbook, the most important developments for developing countries have
been the further slide in oil prices and interest rates. The other
significant event has been the announcement of a major anti-inflation
program in Brazil on February 28. The package includes:
1. A wage and price freeze after an initial adjustment of wages.
Wages will increase by an unspecified amount if the price level rises by
20 percent relative to its level at the time of the freeze.
2. Pegging the cruzado (a new currency--one cruzado equals 1,000
cruzeiros) at 13.8 cruzados to the U.S dollar. (Immediately before the
program, the official exchange rate of the cruzeiro was about 13,800 to
the U.S. dollar with a daily crawling devaluation linked to Brazilian
inflation.)
3. Abolition of indexed treasury securities and creation of
non-indexed securities.
4. Conversion of cruzeiro denominated debts to cruzados in a way
that the real value of debt is reduced.
No explicit announcement was made regarding monetary and fiscal
policies, although the government claims that its fiscal position in
January and February had become substantially stronger. The fiscal
deficit was about 3 percent of GDP in 1985. The new program declaration
is also vague about whether the new fixed exchange rate would continue
to be periodically adjusted to offset the effects of inflation.
It is difficult to assess the likely effects of the new program
without knowing what the government plans to do with regard to under-
lying monetary and fiscal policies. Expansionary fiscal policy and an

IV-28
accommodating monetary policy have been problems for Brazil in the past.
However, the government claims to have the fiscal deficit under control,
and, if the initial wage and price freeze and deindexation are supported
by restrained monetary and fiscal policy, the program does provide
Brazil an opportunity to reduce inflation dramatically. Inflation
averaged about 15 percent per month for the three months preceding the
new package. It remains to be seen how Brazil plans to deal with the
relative price distortions that existed at the time of the freeze and
the distortions that will develop over the next few months.
Brazil and its creditor banks agreed on March 1 to reschedule about
$6 billion of debt that fell due in 1985. The debt is to be rescheduled
over seven years with five years grace. The rescheduling fee has been
waived, there is no prime rate option for the banks, and the spread over
LIBOR is 1-1/8 percent compared with 2 percent in the rescheduling
arranged in September 1983. Brazil and the banks also agreed that $9.5
billion of 1986 maturities would be rolled over into 1987, likewise at a
spread over LIBOR of 1-1/8 percent, and that about $15.5 billion of
trade credit and interbank placement lines would be extended.
Brazil and its Paris Club creditors are still at odds on what to do
about mounting arrears of principal and interest on official credits.
Brazil's arrears to official creditors are now close to $2 billion.
Brazil wants a rescheduling, but official creditors have been insisting
that Brazil must first negotiate an IMF program, which is a step Brazil
is unlikely to take.
Mexico's export earnings and public sector revenues are being
sharply lowered by the decline in oil prices and a reduction in the

IV-29
volume of oil exported. At current prices and a likely export volume of
1.3 million barrels per day, oil export earnings would be about $6.7
billion less than in 1985 and public sector revenues would fall short of
the amount assumed in the budget by at least 3 percent of GDP.
Prior to the recent decline in oil prices, Mexico had been seeking
net new external public sector financing of about $4 billion (of which
$2.5 billion was to have been provided by commercial banks). On
March 3, the Finance Ministry revised import projections downward by
$1.5 billion, projections of non-oil exports upward by $500 million
(partly because of higher coffee prices), estimates of external interest
payments downward by $800 million (to reflect declining world interest
rates and the delayed effect of the reduced spread under the multi-year
debt restructuring agreement), and the provision for an increase in net
foreign exchange reserves downward by about $1.2 billion. Finance Secre-
tary Silva-Herzog subsequently said that only about $4 billion would be
borrowed, as originally planned ($2.5 billion from commercial banks),
and that stepped up non-oil exports and a Paris Club rescheduling would
close the remaining $2 billion gap.
In February, the CPI rose by 4.4 percent and was about 66 percent
higher than a year earlier. Real GDP growth has been slowing and is
likely to be negative in 1986. Since early February, the free market
exchange rate has remained relatively stable, while the rate of crawl of
the controlled exchange rate has continued to accelerate. On March 26,
the spread between the two rates was about 3.0 percent, down from more
than 50 percent in mid-November 1985. Negotiations with the IMF on a
program are continuing. To reduce the public sector deficit, the sale

IV-30
of state enterprises is being stepped up. The two publicly owned
Mexican airlines are among 200 state enterprises to be sold in coming
weeks. The list includes twelve of the 500 largest enterprises in
Mexico.
New understandings between Argentina and the IMF regarding quanti-
tative performance tests forthe end of March and an extension of the
IMF program through May were approved by the IMF Executive Board on
March 10. This triggered the release of a drawing on the Fund that was
postponed in November 1985 when deviations from the program occurred
beginning in September. Reinstatement of the IMF agreement is expected
to pave the way for the resumption of disbursements under the commercial
bank loan, which were held up by the delays in obtaining the IMF
drawings. Arrears on current transactions were still $1.6 billion at
the end of 1985, and are to be fully eliminated by the end of June 1986.
Negotiations for new financing and a rescheduling of debts to foreign
banks are expected to begin soon. The public sector cash deficit (plus
central bank losses) amounted to 4.7 percent of GDP in 1985-Q4, but is
expected to be about 3 percent in 1986, if present budgetary plans are
fulfilled. The CPI rose by only 1.7 percent in February, the lowest
monthly increase since 1974. Since last June, the CPI has increased at
an annual rate of about 41 percent. The authorities are under strong
pressure from organized labor to relax the wage freeze. A survey by a
private research group shows that, while real wages fell sharply in the
first half of 1985, they have remained fairly constant since the austral
stabilization plan was launched last June. The spread between the offi-
cial and free market exchange rates, which held steady at around 9

IV-31
percent throughout February and early March, widened to nearly 15
percent on March 25, in the light of partial reports that March infla-
tion is likely to be in the 3-1/2 -4 percent range and on speculation
that the official exchange rate will soon have to be devalued.
Venezuela signed its $21.2 billion rescheduling agreement with
commercial banks on February 26. Venezuela will make a $750 million
downpayment in July, but will receive additional time to repay $0.9
billion of principal due in 1985 and 1986. In an annual State of the
Nation address on February 27, President Lusinchi confirmed that
Venezuela will try to invoke the contingency clause in the rescheduling
agreement under which the terms can be renegotiated if economic
conditions (in this case, the drop in oil prices) change sharply; a
reduction in interest rate spreads is expected to be sought. The
contingency clause does not oblige banks to change the terms, but merely
to consider changes. Despite the sharp drop in export and tax revenues
because of falling oil prices, the Venezuelan government intends to go
ahead with its planned three-year investment program to spur growth.
The plan calls for Bs. 12 billion (about $0.6 billion at the free market
rate) to be spent in 1986. On February 26 the government approved the
issuance of a first tranche of Bs. 7.5 billion of bonds to finance its
investment program.
Peru continues to send mixed signals regarding its intentions for
servicing its external debt. On February 10, the IMF Executive Board
gave Peru until April 16 to eliminate its arrears to the Fund, and if
it fails to do so, the Board may declare Peru ineligible to use IMF
resources. (Peru's arrears to the IMF now exceed SDR 100 million.)

IV-32
Peruvian officials initially responded angrily to this prospect. More
recently there have been some indications that Peru may try to reach
some accommodation with the IMF. Late in February, Peru canceled the
visit of a routine IMF consultation team that had been scheduled for
early March. More recently Peru has indicated that it may be willing to
have the consultation in Washington instead of in Peru. A Peruvian dele-
gation recently met with Peru's commercial bank advisory committee. The
Peruvians agreed to make an interest payment on Peru's medium and
long-term debt, of unspecified amount, sometime in April. Peru's
interest arrears to banks currently exceed $450 million, and no interest
or principal payments have been made on Peru's medium and long-term
public sector debt since July 1985. The Peruvians also said that they
would present a rescheduling proposal to the committee by early June.
Due to sharp increases in coffee prices, Colombia may draw only
half of its 1985-86 $1 billion commercial bank credit package and may be
able to amortize some of its outstanding debt ahead of schedule. The
government has reached agreement with the National Coffee Federation on
the distribution of income from the coffee bonanza.
In the Philippines, President Marcos left office on February 25 and
the administration of Corazon Aquino assumed power, with Jaime Ongpin
(former president of a large mining company) being appointed Finance
Minister. Governor Fernandez was reappointed as head of the central
bank. Minister Ongpin has indicated that the new administration will
give top priority to increasing food output rather than export promotion.
Various state corporations will be returned to the private sector and
the new administration hopes to attract equity investment. An IMF team

IV-33
visited Manila the week of March 10 to assess the economic situation
under the current stabilization program which runs to June 30, 1986.
It seems likely that the present IMF program will be canceled and a new
program will be negotiated over the next few months. Under this
scenario, there would likely be delays in the disbursement of $350
million from commercial banks, since bank disbursements are tied to
performance under the IMF stand-by.
