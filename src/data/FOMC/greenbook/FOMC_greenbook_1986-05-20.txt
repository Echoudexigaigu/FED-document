The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity in the aggregate appears to be expanding gradually,
but with marked contrasts across sectors and geographical regions. Lower
interest rates are spurring strong gains in purchases of new homes, and
the underlying determinants of consumer spending appear favorable. At
the same time, however, the industrial sector remains relatively weak,
owing in part to sharp cutbacks in oil drilling. Aggregate price measures
have declined further, reflecting plummeting prices for petroleum products,
while nominal wage increases have been restrained.
Industrial Production
The index of industrial production apparently edged up in April,
after declines in February and March, as small gains in motor vehicle
assemblies and steel output offset a further plunge in oil and gas well
drilling. Over the first four months of the year, total industrial
production declined. The sharp cutback in auto assemblies in March
contributed importantly to the weakness, but production of business
equipment, excluding motor vehicles, also has been weak in recent months,
reflecting continued import pressures and weak order levels.
Although auto assemblies were up slightly in April, automakers
intend to cut production during the second quarter as a whole. Using
seasonal factors developed for the index of industrial production,
current assembly plans call for cars to be built at a 7.9 million unit
annual rate in the second quarter, down from an 8.3 million unit pace in
the first quarter. The Commerce Department's estimate of auto production,
which incorporates alternative seasonal adjustment factors, places planned
II-1

II-2
auto assemblies at a 7.4 million unit annual rate in the second quarter,
compared with an 8.9 million unit rate during the first three months of
this year. The sharp drop in the Commerce Department's estimate of auto
assemblies should have a substantial downward effect on real GNP growth
in the second quarter, reducing it by roughly 1-1/2 tp 2 percentage
points at an annual rate.
With declines in output widespread, capacity utilization in total
industry dropped 0.6 percentage point in March to 79.4 percent, its
lowest level since December 1983. Utilization rates in manufacturing and
mining dropped 0.6 and 0.9 percentage point respectively in March, while
the rate for utilities edged down. In April, overall capacity utilization
apparently remained about unchanged.
Employment and Unemployment
Nonfarm employment, as measured by the establishment survey, continued
to expand in April, but, as in the first quarter, job gains were unbalanced
across industries. In recent months, the service-producing sector has
accounted for much of the overall growth, adding more than 900,000 jobs
since December. Hiring at construction sites also has picked up this year,
reflecting the boom in housing activity and increased highway construction.
In manufacturing, however, widespread employment losses took place in
recent months in both durable and nondurable goods industries, and the
factory workweek slipped from the very high levels reported at the end
of last year. Employment in oil and gas extraction, after drifting
downward throughout 1985, plummeted during the first four months of this
year as firms adjusted drilling activity to lower oil prices. Since

January of this year, nearly 20 percent of the jobs in this sector have
been lost.
The unemployment rate, which stood at 7.1 percent in April, has
shown no improvement from the levels that prevailed in late 1985. Although
jobless rates in most states were little changed in the first quarter,
there were signs of deteriorating labor market conditions in those states
most closely tied to the oil and gas industry.
Autos
Domestic auto sales continue to be influenced by changes in the
sales terms offered by manufacturers. In late March, GM announced list
price increases averaging about 3 percent, possibly in response to higher
prices for imported cars or perhaps to window-dress future incentive
programs by allowing for larger discounts from list prices. Ford and
Chrysler declined to follow this strategy for cars, but did raise list
prices for some other vehicles. In mid-April, when most of the early
spring incentives were due to expire, the major domestic automakers
launched a new series of sales incentives, followed by some additional
shaving of finance rates around the end of the month.
Reflecting the efforts by consumers to beat GM's announced price
increases and the enticements of the incentive programs, sales of domestic
cars rose to an 8.0 million unit annual rate in April from their sluggish
6.9 million unit pace in the previous month. However, this sales pace
still fell a little short of assemblies in April, further increasing the
already-bloated level of auto inventories.
Sales of foreign cars were at a 3.1 million unit annual rate in
April, compared with the 2.8 million unit average pace of sales during

the first quarter of this year. An increase in sales of Japanese cars
during April, the first month of the new quota year, accounted for most
of the rise.
Personal Consumption and Income
Recent consumer data generally have shown strong gains in income,
wealth, and spending. Personal consumption expenditures, in real terms,
rose more than 4 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter of 1986
after almost no growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Although
outlays for durable goods were little changed, on balance, in the first
quarter, real spending for nondurables surged ahead at almost an 8 percent
annual rate, and expenditures on services posted a sizable gain. In
April, the preliminary estimate of retail sales for goods excluding
autos fell back from its March pace. Outlays for general merchandise
were up more than 1 percent in April, continuing the substantial gains
posted in previous months, while spending declined for food and household
durables.
Disposable personal income in constant dollars advanced 5.6 percent
in the first quarter, after little growth in the second half of 1985.
Declines in consumer prices in February and March, coupled with moderate
gains in nominal personal income, have accounted for most of the recent
improvement in real income. With total personal consumption expenditures
increasing less than disposable income in the first quarter, the saving
rate rose to 4.3 percent from 4.0 percent in the final three months of
1985.

Not only have households enjoyed stronger real income growth, but
household balance sheets, on the whole, have improved in recent months.
A strengthening in the prices of existing houses and the continuing boom
in stock and bond markets have contributed to increases in household
wealth. In addition, although some indicators of debt service problems,
such as installment loan delinquency rates, have moved up, both lower
interest rates on closed-end installment debt and the ability to refinance
mortgage debt at lower rates are reducing payment burdens somewhat.
Apparently responding to these favorable factors, both the Michigan
Survey Research Center and the Conference Board reported extremely high
buying plans in their most recent surveys. An exceptionally large proportion
of consumers, citing lower interest rates, viewed this as a good time to
buy autos and homes. And almost half of the households surveyed reported
that their financial situations had improved during the past year; not
since the 1960s have consumers' assessments of their own financial progress
been this favorable for so long a period of time. Detail in the Michigan
survey also suggests that some consumers may be attempting to buy in
advance of higher prices for imports; this seems to be affecting demand
for imported cars and electronic goods. Nevertheless, fewer consumers
than at any time since 1966 commented about the erosion of living standards
due to inflation.
Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for business fixed investment fell sharply in the first
quarter. Overall, first-quarter spending for equipment declined at nearly
an 18 percent annual rate, about reversing a large fourth-quarter rise.
This recent volatility probably reflects two special factors that shifted

II-10
spending from the first quarter into the fourth quarter of last year.
First, IBM accelerated initial deliveries of its Sierra computer, apparently
to improve 1985 earnings. Second, and more generally, fear of adverse
tax changes for equipment purchased in 1986 likely prompted firms to move
planned spending into late 1985.
In the case of nonresidential structures, first-quarter real spending
was depressed by a 40 percent (annual rate) plunge in drilling activity,
a contraction that apparently has continued. In contrast, the remaining
categories of nonresidential structures posted a small advance on balance,
led in large part by gains in the "other commercial" sector (primarily
stores and warehouses). The first-quarter retrenchment in equipment purchases
was reflected in a sudden plunge in shipments of nondefense capital goods
in January. With the increases posted in subsequent months, shipments by
March had recovered to a level 3-3/4 percent above the quarterly average,
suggesting a single bounceback in second-quarter equipment outlays.
Looking further ahead, new orders for nondefense capital goods
have been lackluster, while new commitments for nonresidential construction
have edged off recently, probably reflecting excess capacity in the
industrial and office sectors. More generally, fear of adverse tax
changes for fixed investment probably will continue to restrain spending.
Recent capital spending surveys, reflecting these concerns as well as the
contraction in the energy sector, point to no more than modest growth in
outlays for the year as a whole. Although firms outside of the oil-producing
sector have strengthened their 1986 spending plans since last fall, these
gains have been offset by expectations of sharply reduced outlays in
petroleum and mining. The most bearish of the surveys--conducted by

McGraw-Hill in March and April-indicated a 1/2 percent decline in nominal
expenditures this year, which implies further declines in spending over
the rest of 1986. In contrast, the latest Merrill Lynch survey, reported
a planned increase of 3 percent in 1986 spending, about in line with the
earlier Commerce Department survey. Given the low first-quarter level of
outlays, these plans imply moderate spending gains by the end of 1986.
Because none of these three surveys has a distinctly better track record
than the others in predicting actual spending, their differing implications
underscore the considerable uncertainty about investment spending over
the rest of this year.
Housing
The pace of new residential construction remained vigorous during
March as private housing starts registered a 1.95 million unit annual rate.
Single-family starts were about unchanged from the previous month's high
level while multifamily starts dropped 7 percent from their advanced
February rate. For the first quarter as a whole, total housing starts
were up 12 percent from the previous three-month period, and rose in all
regions except the South. The dip in housing starts in the South is
attributable in part to earlier overbuilding as well as to economic
problems in some of the oil-producing areas. Indeed, rental vacancy
rates in the South rose to a record 9.5 percent in the first quarter, and
remain well above those in other regions of the U.S. Nationally, newly-
issued residential building permits picked up by 2 percent in March and
were up 6 percent for the first quarter-rising in all regions except the
South.

Sales of new single-family homes jumped in March to the highest
level in the 23-year history of the series. The robust first-quarter
sales pace left the inventory of unsold homes at its lowest level
in over a year and a half. In contrast to new homes, sales of existing
homes showed no response through March to the falloff in mortgage interest
rates. Sales were unchanged from February's pace and 7 percent below the
high fourth-quarter pace.
In many cases, consumers have responded to lower interest rates by
purchasing higher quality homes. Although average new home prices increased
9 percent over the year ended in the first quarter of 1986, the constant-
quality new home price index rose only 2.5 percent during this period.
The average sales price of existing homes also rose 9 percent in the year
ended in March.
Business Inventories
The business inventory picture has changed little this year, apart
from the buildup in auto dealers' stocks. In the manufacturing sector,
inventories declined in the first quarter, as they have since early 1985;
except for some special categories, however, such as petroleum and the
volatile aircraft series, recent changes in manufacturers' inventories
have been relatively moderate. Overall, the evidence suggests that, with
goods prices flat, sales still sluggish, and materials in ready supply,
manufacturers have no desire to boost stocks. Nonauto trade stocks rose
moderately early this year, and stock-sales ratios were little changed.
Federal Government
Real federal purchases declined at a 32 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, reflecting a marked slowdown in Commodity Credit Corporation

II-16
(CCC) acquisitions of agricultural inventories and a decline in defense
spending. The pattern of CCC purchases in recent quarters largely reflects
problems in the agricultural sector. Late last year, when a huge crop
harvest was depressing market prices, financially-strapped farmers turned
to the CCC in extraordinary numbers for loans to finance inventories.
(In the National Income Accounts, these loans are counted as part of
federal purchases.) First-quarter CCC loan activity, although still
substantial, was at a much slower pace than in the fourth quarter. To a
considerable extent, the fluctuations in CCC stockpiling in recent quarters
have been mirrored by opposite and largely offsetting changes in private
farm inventories, and thus have had little net effect on real GNP.
First-quarter defense purchases were reduced by slower than scheduled
deliveries of some big ticket items, such as the B-1 bomber, and delays in
the delivery of space equipment related to the Challenger shuttle disaster.
Spending for research and development services also declined. It should
be noted that preliminary NIPA defense estimates were based on actual
federal outlay data for only January and February. The more recent March
figures show some bounceback in defense outlays.
On May 1, the Senate passed a budget resolution that would reduce
the fiscal 1987 deficit (based on the economic assumptions in the Congressional
Budget Office baseline) to the $144 billion limit mandated in the Gramm-
Rudman-Hollings Act. Compared with the administration's February budget,
the Senate resolution calls for $7 billion more in 1987 tax increases and
$7 billion less in 1987 nondefense cuts. The Senate budget also would
provide $19 billion less in new fiscal 1987 defense budget authority,

although outlay estimates are essentially the same as in the
administration budget owing to projections of higher rates of spending
out of existing budget authority.
On May 8, the House Budget Committee also approved a budget plan
that is similar in many respects to the Senate plan. The principal
difference is a cut in defense outlays that is $6 billion larger, but
there also are some differences in the composition and size of nondefense
cuts; revenue proposals are about the same. Action on this proposal by
the full House is expected later this week.
In other Congressional action, the Senate Finance Committee has
approved a comprehensive tax reform package, which is scheduled to be
considered by the full Senate during June; the House approved a somewhat
different reform package last December. Both packages would lower marginal
individual and corporate income tax rates and eliminate various tax
preferences and loopholes that currently narrow the tax base. The bills
also would shift tax burdens from individuals to corporations, with a
somewhat greater shift in the House bill. Differences between the House
and Senate bills will have to be reconciled in a Senate-House conference
before a final bill is enacted.
State and Local Sector
Real outlays for goods and services in the state and local sector
rose 2.4 percent in the first quarter, about the same as the growth over
the four quarters of last year. Most of the increase was in spending for
construction; real outlays for compensation rose only slightly.
Although the sector as a whole expanded during the first quarter,
some states, especially those dependent on agricultural and energy-related

II-20
sources of revenue, are experiencing hardships. Oil-producing states
have faced shrinking revenues from severance taxes based on the quantity
or value of extracted natural resources. A rough estimate indicates that
a $10 drop in the price of oil, about what has occurred so far this year,
has cost most of these states 5 to 10 percent of total expected revenue.
Secondary effects on energy-related community businesses and personal
income are likely to reduce revenues further. In addition, the weakness
in farm income and related spillover effects on agricultural-related
businesses continue to affect many agricultural states.
It appears that most of the states facing erosion on their budget
positions are rapidly making adjustments, either through budget cuts
or tax increases. Seventeen states already have reduced fiscal 1986
expenditures from planned levels (in particular, Texas, Oklahoma, and
North Dakota have cut spending substantially), while other states are
reducing budgets for fiscal 1987. In addition, more than 40 states are
planning some sort of limitation on salary increases to employees, several
are limiting hiring, and a few states are likely to begin furloughing
state employees later this year.
Some states also are undertaking alternative measures to deal with
revenue shortfalls. Alaska and Wyoming are transferring funds from their
reserve accounts, while other states are planning tax increases. A
recent canvas indicates that 12 states are planning to raise taxes in
fiscal 1987, while only 4 are planning reductions. As in recent years,
the preference seems to be for increases in sales and excise taxes,
especially for fuel and tobacco, and reductions in income taxes.

II-21
Prices
Major price indexes continued to fall in March, led by a further
drop in prices for petroleum products. The consumer price index for all
urban consumers fell 0.4 percent for the second month, and producer
prices of finished goods were down more than one percent. During the
first quarter of this year, the CPI and PPI fell at annual rates of about
2 and 12-1/2 percent, respectively.
Retail prices for both gasoline and fuel oil dropped further in
March, reflecting the continued passthrough of lower crude oil costs. The
prices of both products fell almost 20 percent in the first three months of
this year, and private survey data indicate that pump prices declined
significantly further in April. However, in the volatile spot market,
prices have turned up recently in response to tight near-term supplies of
refinery products and increased demand.
Food prices also helped to hold down inflation rates in the first
quarter. They edged up at the consumer level in March, after a sharp
February decline, but are down on balance so far this year. Recent
price movements for agricultural commodities suggest that the PPI for
crude foods probably declined in April for the fifth consecutive month,
but may turn up in May.
Increases in prices of imported goods have picked up recently, in
response to the substantial depreciation of the dollar over the past
year. As measured by the BLS index, the prices of nonfuel imports rose
3.4 percent (not annualized) in the three months ended in March. So far,
however, the higher import prices do not appear to have had much effect

on the pricing behavior of domestic producers or on price trends at the
retail level. In the CPI, the price index for commodities excluding food
and energy edged down for the second month in March, while in the PPI, the
prices of capital equipment were little changed, on net, in the first
quarter of this year.
The CPI for services excluding energy picked up in March, with
large increases for rents, auto insurance, and medical services. This
index was up 6-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, a bit
faster than the average rate of increase over the past two years.
Wages and Labor Costs
Available measures of labor costs provide differing indications of
the current rate of wage inflation, but all point to continued restraint so far
this year. The hourly earnings index (HEI) was unchanged in April and rose
only 0.8 percent at an annual rate in the first four months of this
year. In contrast, a more comprehensive measure of wages, the employment
cost index (ECI) continues to show wage increases in the 4 percent range,
primarily reflecting larger increases for nonproduction and supervisory
workers excluded from the HEI. Advances in the ECI measure of hourly
compensation costs, which includes employer costs for employee benefits as
well as wages and salaries, decelerated by about 1/2 percentage point over
the past 12 months, largely reflecting employers' efforts to reduce insurance
and pension costs.
In the union sector, wage adjustments for workers covered by major
union settlements have continued to be particularly small. These lower
union wage adjustments in recent years, coupled with somewhat larger increases

in the nonunion sector, have reversed about one-half of the widening in the
union-nonunion wage differential that occurred between 1976 and 1982.
Although compensation trends have been generally favorable,
unit labor costs have been rising at a somewhat faster pace than earlier in
this expansion, largely owing to sluggish productivity performance. Output
per hour was up nearly 3-1/2 percent in the first quarter of this year, but
this rise did not quite offset the sharp drop in output per hour in the
fourth quarter. Indeed, productivity has been essentially flat over the
past year and a half. As a result, all of the recent increases in compensation
per hour have been passed directly through into higher unit labor costs, a
marked contrast to the offset provided by rapid productivity growth during
the earlier stage of this business expansion.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The powerful securities market rally continued into mid-April before
faltering somewhat. Interest rates fell during the first part of the
intermeeting period as market participants viewed the economy as expanding
sluggishly and inflation prospects as favorable, and expectations of another
reduction in the discount rate became widespread. The discount rate was
cut by 1/2 percentage point on April 18. A backup in rates occurred there-
after, however, in association with a sharp fall in the value of the dollar
and an uptick in oil prices, events that reportedly led traders to reevaluate
prospects for further easing steps by the System. Most long-term interest
rates are near their levels of the last FOMC meeting, while intermediate-term
rates have risen, and short rates are lower by 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point.
The monetary aggregates grew briskly in April as more rapid declines
in security yields than in deposit rates boosted inflows to the more liquid
components. M1 soared farther above its 1986 range; this strength, combined
with accelerated growth in money fund shares, MMDAs, and savings deposits,
pushed M2 up into its target range for the first time this year. M3 remained
near the center of its target range, with flatness in its non-M2 component
damping its expansion relative to the narrow aggregates.
Borrowing activity has mushroomed in the past few months; although it
is somewhat difficult to measure the net flows at this point, expansion of
domestic nonfinancial debt probably is picking up this quarter after a sub-
stantial slowing earlier in the year. Corporate bond issuance has continued
to break records--despite a smaller volume of share retirements in connection
with mergers and other corporate restructurings, and a stepped-up pace of new
equity issuance in response to record stock prices--as firms call older,

higher-rate bonds and repay short-term debt. The municipal bond market
has reco-ered from its worst fears of tax reform, and issuance of tax-
exempt bonds in April exceeded the average monthly rate of every past year
but 1985. Activity is hectic in the residential mortgage market, with a
torrent of refinancing applications reportedly delaying closings in many
real estate transactions; available evidence suggests that overall house-
hold sector debt growth is being restrained by a slowing in consumer
installment credit expansion. The Treasury has increased its borrowing
sharply in the second quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, after drawing
down high year-end cash balances in the first quarter.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Ml rose in April at about a 14 percent annual rate for the second
consecutive month, raising this aggregate farther above its 3-to-8 percent
target range for 1986. The sustained strength in narrow money last month
resulted primarily from an acceleration of other checkable deposits (OCDs).
Growth in currency and demand deposits moderated, though demand deposits
advanced at a still rapid 11 percent clip. Recent declines in market
interest rates undoubtedly have contributed importantly to the acceleration
in Ml over the past two months. M1 also likely was boosted a bit by larger
federal tax refunds this April than in recent years.
M2 grew at a 13 percent annual rate in April, its fastest pace since
June of last year. After sluggish growth in the first quarter, this surge
pushed M2 just above the lower limit of its 1986 target cone of 6 to 9
percent.

That M2, even after the April surge, has recorded comparatively slow growth
may reflect in part the influence of rising investor interest in stock and,
especially, bond mutual funds. Net sales of these funds have broken records
month after month.
The nontransaction component of M2 in April was boosted by inflows to
liquid retail accounts. Tax refunds may have contributed to these inflows,
but the more important factor would appear to be interest rates. Savings
deposits grew at their fastest monthly rate since late 1982 (when a temporary
bulge was created by heavy competition among institutions for funds in
anticipation of the introduction of MMDAs). Ceilings on passbook savings
rates were removed on April 1, but in the prevailing environment depository
institutions generally did not move to raise their rates.1 Nonetheless,
the bulk of the increase in savings deposits likely reflects narrowing
yield spreads between savings deposits and alternative instruments.
Indeed, the acceleration of consumer-type deposits as a whole over the
past two months is consistent with changes in yield relationships. Offering
rates on these deposits have not matched the sharp drop in market rates,
resulting in narrower, and in some instances even negative, spreads. The
chart depicts the spread of market rates (represented by the 3-month Treasury
bill rate) over a weighted average of rates offered by commercial banks on
OCDs, MMDAs, savings deposits, and small time deposits, along with the inflows
into the sum of these accounts at all depository institutions. Inflows to
these deposits clearly have been inversely related to the rate spread.
1. Reports from the Reserve Bank contact group indicate that few depository
institutions responded to the ceiling removal by offering higher rates, and
a scattering of institutions actually lowered savings rates. Share accounts
at credit unions, which are included in savings deposits but were unaffected
by removal of the passbook rate ceiling, accounted for a disproportionate
amount of the increase in savings deposits in April.

Rate spreads also appear to be influencing the relative growth rates
of components of the aggregates. The top panel of the chart shows the
spread at commercial banks between the 6-month small time deposit rate and
a weighted average rate on Super NOW accounts, savings accounts, and MMDAs.
Again, the responsiveness of deposit growth to rate spreads is apparent
in the lower panel; with small time deposit rates having adjusted compara-
tively rapidly to downward movements in market rates in the recent period,
funds have moved toward the more liquid deposit categories.
M3 expanded at a 10 percent annual rate in April, with all of its
growth in its M2 component. Increases in institution-only money funds and
large time deposits issued by thrifts were balanced by runoffs of large
time deposits and term RPs and Eurodollar deposits at commercial banks.
With strong core deposit inflows outstripping bank credit growth in April,
commercial banks further reduced their managed liabilities by advancing
about $7 billion to their foreign offices.
The weaker bank credit growth in April resulted from a deceleration
in loans and and a continued run-off of security holdings. Banks appar-
ently have been taking advantage of much higher securities prices to realize
capital gains by selling some of their U.S. government securities. Holdings
of tax-exempt securities also have continued to decline, but they still
remain above the average level of last December, when banks were in the
process of acquiring a large volume of tax-exempt securities amid uncertain-
ty about 1986 tax reform. Real estate loans again showed strong growth in
April. Security loans, however, fell off sharply after an extraordinary
surge in March, and consumer loans decelerated.

Business Finance
Gross public bond offerings of nonfinancial firms, both here and
abroad, set records in April for the third consecutive month. The torrid
pace of bond issuance in part reflects corporate efforts to lengthen the
maturity of liabilities. More than half of new domestic issues in April
were for at least 20 years, and more than 40 percent of Euromarket issuance
was fixed-rate debt of at least 10 years' maturity. In addition, outstand-
ing loans and short-term market paper probably contracted in April, as
bank business loan growth slowed and nonfinancial commercial paper fell
at a 40 percent annual rate.
Gross bond borrowing has been partly offset by retirements of exist-
ing higher-coupon issues. Salomon Brothers estimates that $7 billion of
nonconvertible debt was called by nonfinancial firms in the first quarter,
and another $5 billion in April; this compares with about $8 billion for
all of last year, itself a very high total. About half the calls have
been by utilities, generally under standard bond indentures allowing debt
to be refunded after five years at a small premium above par. A few in-
dustrial firms have used "cash calls;" because the debt they are retiring
is nonrefundable, that is, protected from calls financed by new debt with a
lower coupon, these firms have had to use cash generated from asset sales,
stock sales, or accumulated earnings. Even taking account of the stepped-up
level of retirements, though, the pace of net bond borrowing appears to
have increased greatly, as suggested by the table on page III-11.1
1. A large share-estimated at 40 to 50 percent-of the net increase is
accounted for by firms that have recently participated in mergers, LBOs,
or share repurchases.

As the volume of bond issues has ballooned, the spread between the
Board's recently offered utility rate index and the yield on 30-year
Treasuries has widened to well above its 1985 average. Some of this
widening may reflect revised investor valuations of the call options re-
tained by debt issuers. Some issuers have responded by offering securities
with tighter call and refunding provisions.
Businesses also have maintained a lively pace of issuance of new
shares and equity-linked debt in association with the strong stock market,
while merger and buyout activity and stock repurchases have slowed appreci-
ably since the end of last year. The preliminary GNP accounts for the first
quarter suggest an improvement in economic profits and aggregate after-tax
retained earnings probably more than offset stock retirements.
Treasury and Federally Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff is projecting a combined federal deficit for the current
quarter of $23 billion, a seasonally small deficit because of the large tax
collections in April. The Treasury is expected to borrow about $46 billion
this quarter to finance this deficit and to add $14 billion to its cash
balance. (Technical factors-in particular float and accrued interest--are
expected to absorb $9 billion.)

At its mid-quarter refunding last week, the Treasury issued $27
billion of new securities, evenly distributed among 3-, 10-, and 30-year
instruments, to raise $12.8 billion of net new funds.1 Much market commen-
tary before the auctions was focused on whether, in light of the weakness
of the dollar, foreign demand would be strong at prevailing interest rates.
In fact, foreign investors' orders reportedly were substantial, particularly
for the 30-year bonds.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies has been light
thus far in the second quarter, after a net paydown of outstanding debt in
the first quarter. Fannie Mae's borrowing requirements have been reduced
somewhat by heavy mortgage refinancings, which tend to reduce temporarily
the mortgage loans held by Fannie Mae.2 The reduction in the debt of the
Farm Credit Banks apparently is associated with weak demand for new credit
by the agricultural sector.
Borrowing by the Home Loan Banks has surged thus far in the second
quarter as the demand by S&Ls for advances--especially longer-term
advances-has picked up. The Banks seek to match the durations of their
assets and liabilities; thus, larger than normal portions of their recent
borrowing have carried maturities in the range of 7 to 10 years. The
interest rate spread over Treasury securities on these longer-term issues
has been in excess of 50 basis points, compared with the spreads of 25 or
1. The Treasury appreciably boosted the sizes of the 10- and 30-year issues
compared with recent refundings, because of its decision no longer to
offer 20-year bonds. This security never was popular with investors, and
this lack of of interest was reflected in a higher rate--typically 10 to
20 basis points more than the 30-year issue.
2. Borrowing by Fannie Mae may fall sharply in the months ahead, owing to
its recently announced plan to sell $10 billion of older mortgages from its
portfolio. The exact timing of the sale was not specified, nor was the use
of the proceeds.

30 points that the Home Loan Banks normally paid on such securities in the
past. The spreads were boosted primarily because of the large size of the
issues. Also, investors may be concerned about the role the Home Loan
Banks are expected to play in financing the FSLIC.1
Tax-Exempt Markets
Issuance of tax-exempt bonds has accelerated since early in the year.
Offerings in April totaled more than $12 billion, up from $8 billion in
March. The surge in issuance of short-term securities in April reflected
the large annual spring financing by New York State; this year the financ-
ing raised $3.5 billion, $800 million less than in the two prior springs.
Nearly half of the volume in longer-term markets so far this year has been
refunding bonds, as governmental units seek to replace high-cost debt at
lower interest rates. Public utilities have accounted for a large share
of the refunding, but states and localities also are refinancing public-
purpose bonds.
The stepped-up pace of tax-exempt issuance, and continuing uncer-
tainty about the treatment of municipal securities in any tax-reform
legislation passed this year, evidently have put upward pressure on yields.
The ratio of yields on tax-exempt general obligation bonds to yields on
Treasuries of comparable maturity neared its 1969 record in mid-April, and
the Bond Buyer revenue bond index exceeded Treasury bond yields throughout
1. Under the current proposal, the FSLIC Funding Facility would be formed
with an initial capitalization of $3 billion from the Federal Home Loan
Banks; the Funding Facility also would raise $10 to $15 billion through
long-term debt securities. The Facility would purchase about $2 billion
of long-term Treasury zero coupon securities, which should be sufficient to
pay off the principal of the Facility's initial debt issuance. The interest
on the debt securities would be paid from the FSLIC's annual income.

the intermeeting period.1 Municipal-corporate yield ratios have risen as
well, though not to record levels.

Issuance of municipal securities began to recover from tax-reform
concerns in March, as bond counsels approved covenants in accord with the
requirements of the House tax-reform bill (H.R. 3838).2 A further boost to
the market came in mid-March, when the House, Senate, and Treasury agreed
to put off the effective date of several key restrictions on public-purpose
bonds until September 1, or until final passage of tax-reform legislation,
whichever comes first. A few days later, trading in municipal securities
markets came to a virtual standstill when Senator Packwood proposed including
1. The 1969 peak of this ratio reflected at least in part Treasury and
Congressional efforts to restrict IDBs and arbitrage bonds, and a threat
to include municipal-bond interest in an alternative minimum tax.
2. The tax-exempt market also has begun to see a trickle of private-purpose
bonds. Most of these have been current refundings, i.e., offerings of
bonds whose proceeds will be used to refund outstanding bonds within 30
days; sales of these bonds would retain tax-exempt status under H.R. 3838.

III-16
all tax-exempt interest income under an expanded personal minimum tax.
Within a week, however, the full Senate Finance Committee rejected such a
provision. Participants in municipal markets gained additional confidence
in April, as the difficulties of the Senate Finance Committee in shaping an
acceptable plan seemed to doom tax reform altogether. This optimism con-
tinued despite Finance Committee approval of a draft plan.
The Finance Committee plan would preserve much of the tax-exempt
market; however, it would impose curbs on arbitrage and advance refundings,
and it retains the scheduled phase-out of single-family housing bonds and
small-issue industrial development bonds (IDBs). The plan is less restrictive
than H.R. 3838: while H.R. 3838 would retain small-issue IDBs, the Finance
Committee plan allows a more generous definition of public-purpose bonds
and retains banks' tax deduction for 80 percent of the interest costs of
holding tax-exempt securities. The final form of any tax legislation will
not be decided for several months, however, and many investors remain wary.
Residential Mortgage Markets
Refinancing has continued to surge. Fully one-third of FHA home
loan applications in April were for refinancing, and refinancings in the
conventional loan market also appear to have experienced a sharp pickup.
Refinancing earlier this year likely did not result in large withdrawals
of equity from the underlying property, judging from the slowing in net
residential mortgage debt growth to an 8.5 percent annual rate in the first
quarter.
Widespread refinancing has not yet shown up in available data on
thrift institutions lending activity, which do not go beyond March. Loan
retirements of $10.5 billion (SA) in March actually were down slightly at

III-17
S&Ls from their February pace, and loan originations declined in each of
the first three months of 1986. However, there is a substantial time lag
between loan applications and closings--and reports indicate that this lag
is lengthening because of the crush of applications-so it may be that the
pickup in mortgage borrowing will not be reflected in the data until the
second quarter.
Vigorous activity is suggested by more current data on thrift institu-
tion liabilities. Thrift institutions augmented stepped-up growth in core
deposits in April by boosting managed liabilities. Over the past two months
large CD issuance at thrifts has proceeded at the fastest pace since 1984,
and advances surged by $4 billion in April. Staff at the FHLBB report that
the demand for advances was widespread geographically and appeared to be
linked to both actual and anticipated increases in assets.1
Mortgage interest rates are little changed on balance since the last
FOMC meeting. Despite a spread of 140 basis points in favor of adjustable-
rate mortgages, most homebuyers have been opting for the security of fixed-
rate financing, with rates on these instruments at their lowest levels in
seven years. Only 29 percent of conventionally financed home purchases in
early April involved adjustable-rate financing, and market sources indicate
that an even smaller percentage of the recent refinancing volume carries
adjustable rates. Issuance of mortgage pass-through securities accelerated
to a record pace in April; roughly 60 percent of the heavy volume of these
1. Some of this borrowing may be in response to prospective liability-based
capital requirements for FSLIC-insured institutions. A FHLBB proposal, now
out for public comment, would impose a 6 percent capital requirement on
incremental liability growth after the third quarter of 1986, but allow a
6-year phase-in of the capital requirement on then-existing liabilities.

instruments in the first quarter was linked to newly originated mortgages,
about the proportion of the past two years.
Mortgage rates in the primary and secondary markets have not fallen
nearly as much in recent months as have Treasury yields of comparable
maturity. Some lag in the adjustment of mortgage rates is normal,
but other factors also are contributing to the widened spread. Increased
investor concern regarding the risk of mortgage prepayments, given the
recent prepayment volume and greater interest rate volatility, appears
to account for some of the recent widening of spreads over Treasuries
observed on both current-coupon and premium-coupon mortgage pass-throughs.
In addition, a record volume of new issues of mortgage securities has been
marketed in recent months, and the market may well expect an even larger
supply to follow.
Consumer Installment Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit outstanding has slowed markedly,
to an 8 percent annual rate in March. New-car sales dropped in March, after
manufacturers shifted to less attractive financing programs. Growth in auto
credit was about unchanged for the quarter as a whole, however, and it was a
slowing in other categories that accounted for the bulk of the deceleration
in total credit. Data for consumer loans at commercial banks suggest a
continuation of more moderate growth in April, but the swings in market
share between banks and captive finance companies argue for some caution in
interpreting these numbers.
A combination of aggresive lending and economic weakness in certain
areas seems to be resulting in increasing problems of credit quality.
Consumer loan delinquencies at auto finance companies have continued to

increase, rising in March to 2.13 percent, the highest level in nearly
five years. However, the uptrend began from an unusually low level, so
that this indicator still is not much above the midpoint of its historical
range. Data on delinquency rates on consumer loans at commercial banks
are not yet available for the first quarter, but anecdotal evidence would
suggest that such rates, especially for credit cards, have maintained an
upward trend. The rising credit card delinquencies are not surprising,
given the aggressive marketing techniques employed over the past couple of
years; the consequent pickup in charge-offs was to a considerable extent
predictable, and most banks evidently are finding the interest margins
adequate to absorb the losses. Some notes of caution are being sounded,
but there is to date no sign of a pullback by lenders.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the April 1 FOMC meeting, the foreign-exchange value of the
dollar has declined by about 5 1/2 percent on a weighted-average basis.
Developments have been dominated by market participants' attempts to
discern the policies of the G-5 countries toward the foreign exchange
market, especially in connection with the Tokyo Summit in early May.
Attention during the first part of the intermeeting period was directed
particularly at the dollar's value against the mark, but in recent weeks
attention has shifted to the yen. Since the previous meeting, the dollar
has fallen by about 6 1/2 percent against the mark, with most of that
decline coming in mid-April; against the yen the dollar has declined by
8 1/2 percent. There was little net change in the differential between U.S.
interest rates and a weighted average of foreign interest rates -- both
short and long-term -- during the period.
During the first week of April, the dollar gained about 2 percent
on a weighted-average basis, as market participants reportedly took the
view that G-5 officials were no longer favoring a lower dollar. Key
elements in this view were various statements, primarily by Japanese
officials, to the effect that the dollar may have fallen far enough and
limited but visible dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan. At this time
the dollar was supported by a marked firming of oil prices as well.
Also during the first week of April, the French franc came under
very heavy selling pressure within the European Monetary System. On
April 6, the EMS countries announced a new alignment of central exchange

rates in which the French franc was devalued against the-mark by about 6

reduced official central bank lending rates.

In mid-April, downward pressure on the dollar resumed, gaining
impetus in part from various statements by foreign officials that seemed
to suggest that G-5 authorities might take additional coordinated actions
to lower the dollar's value. A modest package of measures designed to
stimulate the Japanese economy (but notably not including a cut in the
discount rate) and the relative steadiness of German short-term interest
rates -- together with some disappointing U.S. economic data and
continued declines in U.S. interest rates -were factors in a strong
shift in market sentiment away from the dollar. The dollar declined
steadily in mid-month, falling particularly steeply against the mark and
eventually reaching a five-year low of about 2.16 marks per dollar in the
last week of April. Although the dollar's rate of decline against the
mark slowed by the end of the month, upward pressure on the yen continued
strongly throughout the second half of April.

IV-4
The dollar's downward trend was interrupted in the week before the
Tokyo Summit as trading was very light and market participants awaited
new developments. Following the summit declaration on international
economic policy on May 6, the dollar resumed its decline, again mainly
against the yen. Market participants reportedly concluded from the
summit declaration and other statements by officials that Japanese and
German hopes for joint action to slow the dollar's decline had not been
met. The dollar/yen rate reached a post-war low below 160 yen per dollar
in trading on May 12.

IV-5
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Substantial net capital inflows during the first quarter, the
counterpart of continued large trade and current account deficits, took
the form of substantial foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks and
bonds, continued heavy purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, and
large bank-reported inflows. These inflows were offset in part by
unusually heavy purchases of foreign securities by U.S. residents,
particularly in March.
Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks totalled a record $6
billion during the first quarter (see line 2b in the Summary Table on
U.S. International Transactions). This rate was 50 percent higher than
the brisk fourth-quarter pace, as investors abroad apparently were
attracted by the surge in the U.S. stock market.
Private foreign purchases of U.S. corporate bonds slowed
noticeably from an extremely rapid fourth-quarter pace, but remained
above the average quarterly rate for 1985 (line 2a). New Eurobonds
issued by U.S. corporations accelerated in April, totalling over $7
billion through the fourth week of the month. The pickup in April took
place as yields on longer-term instruments dipped close to or below 7
percent, and accompanied a very large volume of domestic issues. A
growing proportion of the issues in the Euromarkets was in longer-term
maturities (10 years or more) at fixed rates. About one-third of the new
issues in March and April were denominated in terms of foreign currency
(largely Swiss francs and yen), but in most cases the bonds were issued
in conjunction with swap arrangements that eliminated the foreign
currency exposure of the U.S. issuers.

IV-6
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities (line 2c) totalled more
than $6 billion during the first quarter, nearly double the previous
high quarterly rate. About one-third of the total was in foreign
stocks, including sizeable purchases of Japanese stocks. The remaining
two-thirds was in bonds, reflecting, in part, a pickup in
dollar-denominated bond issues floated in the U.S. market by foreign
borrowers. A sizeable proportion of U.S. purchases of bonds abroad
apparently was denominated in foreign currency, although firm data on
this breakdown is not available. As further evidence of a possible
growing willingness on the part of U.S. investors to acquire
foreign-currency-denominated securities, U.S. bank holding companies and
other corporations have begun to float sizeable non-dollar security
issues in the U.S. market this year. During January-April, $1.2 billion
equivalent was issued, denominated largely in Australian dollars, at
relatively high nominal interest rates.
Foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities (line 3) continued
to be heavy in the first quarter, but about half of the total was
accounted for by large purchases by the World Bank in March. Most of
the rest was recorded as sales to residents of the United Kingdom and
Canada. Sales recorded to Japanese residents fell to about $1/2 billion
in the first quarter, down sharply from a fourth-quarter total of $5
billion, repeating a pattern of first-quarter declines observed during
the past two years. Independent survey data suggest that total Japanese
purchases of foreign securities (largely dollar denominated) remained
strong during the first quarter suggesting that Japanese investors
shifted from Treasury securities to Eurodollar bonds and U.S. corporate

IV-7
stocks during the period. Total Japanese purchases of foreign
securities apparently accelerated in April.
Foreign official reserve holdings in the United States (line 4)
rose moderately in the first quarter. The increase was largely in the
form of Treasury securities purchased by several major industrial
countries.
U.S. banks recorded a substantial net inflow in the first quarter,
most of it in January (line 1 in the Summary Table). As indicated in
the International Banking Data Table (line 3a), a sizeable portion of
the inflow reflected a continued reduction in net claims of the U.S
offices of U.S. chartered banks on their foreign branches. This flow
appears to have been reversed in April, in association with the increase
in the growth of domestic core deposits relative to a slowing in the
growth of loans and securities at banks.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
Revised U.S. merchandise trade figures for January and February
and very preliminary data for March suggest that on a
balance-of-payments basis the merchandise trade deficit in the first
quarter was smaller than in the fourth quarter of last year as exports
rose somewhat and oil imports declined substantially.
The rise in exports in the first quarter appears to come largely
from machinery (particularly broadcasting equipment and to a lesser
extent construction equipment and business machines) as well as aircraft
and consumer goods. For all nonagricultural exports as a group, the
first-quarter increase was almost entirely in volume; prices of
nonagricultural exports rose on average by less than one-half percent.

The value of agricultural exports was at nearly the same level as
in the fourth quarter. Prices of various export commodities rose
somewhat, especially corn, tobacco and oilseeds with a smaller price
increase for soybeans. The volume of agricultural exports declined a
bit despite continued Soviet purchases of corn and record Soviet
purchases of soybeans. Demand for U.S. agricultural commodities
continued to be affected by ample competing foreign supplies and U.S.
prices that were not competitive in world markets. Later this year U.S.
price supports for various farm crops will be lowered significantly
reflecting provisions of the 1985 farm bill.
The value of imports appears to have declined moderately in the
first quarter. A sharp drop in oil imports was offset by increases in
other import categories. These data are preliminary and are subject to
revision.
Both the price and volume of imported oil dropped in the first
quarter. It is estimated that the average price of imported oil dropped
from $26.30 per barrel in December (on a balance-of-payments basis) to
about $18 per barrel in March in response to developments in world
markets. The volume of oil imported declined moderately from
fourth-quarter rates; in the fourth quarter the volume of imports rose
as stocks of fuel oil were replenished.

The increase in nonoil imports in the first quarter was spread
among various categories including machinery, consumer goods and items
such as gold and coffee; part of that rise in value appears to be in
prices. As measured by the BLS index, prices of nonoil imports rose 3.4
percent (not an annual rate) in the three-month period ending in March
following a 2.3 percent increase during the fourth quarter. Import
price developments sampled by BLS tend to lead changes in unit values
measured by recorded merchandise trade data (and implied in the tables
above).

IV-13
Foreign Economic Developments. The pace of economic activity in foreign
industrial countries has been slow in recent months with the level of
industrial production so far this year generally below the fourth
quarter of last year. This recent weakness has been most pronounced in
Japan, where production levels in the first quarter fell to a level only
1 percent above the first quarter of last year. In Germany, where
industrial production also declined in the first quarter, the level
remained 3.5 percent above a year earlier.
Inflation abroad is slowing further under the influence of lower
oil prices and a weaker dollar. Consumer price inflation was lower in
the first quarter than in the previous quarter in most countries.
Monthly rates for March and April, where available, were very low in all
countries. In Germany, the monthly cost of living index in April was
below its year-earlier level for the first time in 27 years.
First-quarter external surpluses continued at record levels in
Japan and Germany. Both countries' trade and current account surpluses
in the first quarter were approximately equal to their fourth-quarter
rates and substantially higher than a year ago.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, recent data on industrial
production suggest a continuation of the substantial slowing of the pace
of output growth that emerged in 1985. Industrial production fell by
0.6 percent (s.a.) in March after a slight increase in February, so that
the average level of the index for the first quarter was below that of
the previous quarter and just 1.1 percent above its year-earlier level.
Reflecting this slowing of industrial growth, new private sector
machinery orders (s.a.) declined for the second consecutive month by 2.4

percent in March. There is also cumulative evidence of weakness in
other sectors of the economy. Retail sales (s.a.) fell 5 percent in
February and rose 3 percent in March. New housing starts (s.a.)
declined for the second consecutive month in March. Growth in export
volume has slowed substantially in recent months, and in March and
April, the export volume index was below its year-earlier level. As the
table below shows, the slowing of growth in export volume, which started
in early 1985, has been dramatic compared with the strong growth
experienced in 1984.

Inflation is slowing from its already low rate. The Tokyo consumer
price index rose 1.2 percent during the 12 months ending in April.
Wholesale prices in March were more than 8 percent below their
year-earlier level, reflecting the recent sharp appreciation of the yen
and the drop in oil import prices.

IV-18
Although the demands of Japanese trade unions were quite moderate
during this spring's wage negotiations, the outcomes were still below
union demands. For the third consecutive year, the unions gained only
modestly in terms of wages and hours. The private sector wage increase
averaged 5.1 percent, only slightly above the increases of the previous
two years, and the government provided only vague promises to shorten
the work week. Pressure for a lower wage settlement this year primarily
stemmed from the impact of the rapid appreciation of the yen on
export-oriented industries, including the traditionally pace-setting
sectors in wage negotiations such as the metal-working industries.
External surpluses continued at record rates. In the first three
months of the year, the current account surplus was $62 billion
(s.a.a.r.), little changed from the fourth quarter of 1985. The
trade balance in the first quarter was $70 billion (s.a.a.r.).
As part of its ongoing efforts to stimulate domestic demand, and in
light of the continued strengthening of the yen, the Bank of Japan
lowered its discount rate from 4 to 3-1/2 percent on April 21. This was
the third discount rate reduction in four months.
In other actions, Prime Minister Nakasone announced the
recommendations of a specially appointed panel to study structural
adjustments required to reduce Japan's dependence on export-led growth.
The Maekawa Report recommended substantial changes in the Japanese
economy over the medium term, including a reduction in working hours,
growth in wages, abolition of the tax-free savings system on small
accounts, improved market access, and more flexible implementation of
fiscal policy. No timetable for implementation has been announced, and

IV-19
some domestic opposition has emerged to the Maekawa Report. In
association with the Report, Japanese authorities announced a package of
specific short-term measures to stimulate domestic demand. These
measures include an acceleration of planned public works expenditure,
temporary reduction in retail prices of electricity and gas, and
promotion of housing and utilities investment.
Industrial production in Germany fell by 1.3 percent in February
and by 0.3 percent in March. The average first-quarter result was
nearly 1 percent below the fourth quarter and 3.5 percent above a year
ago. The construction sector continues to hold down overall production
data. Building activity in the first quarter was 8 percent (s.a.) below
its fourth-quarter level. New order volumes in the first quarter were
almost 2 percent below fourth-quarter levels as domestic orders remained
sluggish and foreign orders dropped sharply in March. The most recent
business climate survey reports a slight deterioration from a month ago
in the respondents' outlook over the next six months, but continuing
confidence in growth over the next five years. The rate of unemployment
in April was 9.1 percent, only slightly lower than last year's average.
Employment, however, has continued to increase.
The cost of living index in April was 0.1 percent below April of
last year, marking the first year-on-year decline since June 1959.
Through April, the index this year has declined at an annual rate of
about 1 percent. Import prices in March were 18 percent below March
1985. Wholesale and producers prices are also below a year ago.
Excluding energy prices, the cost of living index in March was 1.8
percent above March 1985. Another component that has contributed to the

IV-20
fall in the cost of living is food prices, which were 1.1 percent below
last year in March. This reflects both the decline in prices of
imported food, especially in D-mark terms, and a decline in the prices
of domestic agricultural products.
The first-quarter trade surplus was $9.5 billion (n.s.a.) compared
with $4.2 billion in last year's first quarter. The corresponding
results for the current account were $6.9 billion (n.s.a.) compared with
$1.7 billion last year. This continued high level of the trade surplus
is due primarily to price effects. In constant prices, the trade
surplus has declined from its peak in the second quarter of last year,
and the most recent data on foreign orders suggest that this decline is
continuing.
In France, industrial production increased by 1.5 percent (s.a.) in
February, but was unchanged from its year-earlier level. The
unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage point in March to 10.6 percent
(s.a.), only slightly below the record high level of last January. The
inflation rate has continued to moderate. Consumer prices rose by only
0.3 percent (n.s.a.) in March as the year-over-year inflation rate eased
to 3 percent, not far above the new government's year-end inflation
target of 2.3 percent.
The trade balance in March moved into deficit by $370 million
(s.a.). However, for the first quarter, trade was in surplus by $100
million, only the second quarterly trade surplus in seven years.
The new government of Prime Minister Chirac has begun to implement
its economic program. In conjunction with the devaluation of the franc
within the EMS in early April, a partial lifting of exchange controls

IV-21
and price regulations was announced. The government outlined a program
of extensive denationalization, to be carried out over a four-year
period. Supplemental budget measures for 1986 involved relatively minor
tax and expenditure adjustments, leaving the expected budget deficit
unchanged at slightly below 3 percent of GDP. The newly announced
monetary goal of holding M3 growth in 1986 below 5 percent is consistent
with the previous government's target range of 3 to 5 percent growth in
M3. The Chirac government also indicated its intention to introduce
legislation increasing the autonomy of the Bank of France.
Economic activity in the United Kingdom continues to expand at a
moderate rate, although the rate of growth appears to be somewhat slower
than that experienced last year. Industrial production rose 1.7 percent
(s.a.) in February, reversing its sharp December decline, after January
had seen only a slight increase. Preliminary data indicate that
consumption was flat in the first quarter, although it is thought that
difficulties in seasonal adjustment may have obscured underlying growth.
Inflation in the United Kingdom continues to be moderate. Retail
prices rose only 0.1 percent (n.s.a.) in March, lowering the 12-month
inflation rate to 4.2 percent. The trade deficit in the first quarter
of 1986 was $7.8 billion (s.a.a.r.) and the current account surplus was
$5.0 billion (s.a.a.r.). This compares with a trade deficit of $1.2
billion and a current account surplus of $5.2 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the
previous quarter. Nearly all of the deterioration in the trade balance
occurred in March, when falling oil export revenues and rising imports
led to the largest monthly trade deficit on record.

IV-22
The Bank of England lowered its official lending rates by 1
percentage point in two steps in April. Major U.K. clearing banks
announced similar reductions in their base lending rates, now at 10.5
percent. On April 29, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
announced that the government will permit the creation of a sterling
commercial paper market. Permission to act as underwriters in this
market will initially be granted only to U.K.-licensed banks, although
U.S. investment banks will be allowed to seek special permission to
operate in this market from the Bank of England.
Economic expansion continued in Canada in early 1986. The index of
gross domestic product increased 0.6 percent (s.a.) in February,
bringing the 12-month growth rate to 5.4 percent. The increase was
broadly based among service-producing and goods-producing industries.
The index of industrial production increased 0.7 percent in February,
reversing the January decline. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate
remained at 9.6 percent in April, unchanged from March, which was the
lowest value in four years.
Inflation has continued to be moderate in 1986. Consumer prices
rose 4.1 percent in the 12 months ending in March, about the same
percentage change as during 1985. In addition, Canada's industrial
product price index in February was only 2.9 percent above its
year-earlier level. Canada's trade surplus fell sharply in February to
$0.1 billion, the smallest monthly surplus since September 1981.
Falling oil prices and slow auto sales in the United States resulted in
a drop in the value of merchandise exports; there was a 40 percent

IV-23
reduction in export revenues from crude petroleum and coal. Meanwhile,
imports reached a new record.
Short-term money market rates declined on balance over the past few
weeks. Chartered banks cut their prime lending rates by 50 basis
points, to 10.75 percent. This was the fourth cut in the prime rate
since peaking at 13 percent in mid-February.
In Italy, real GDP increased 2.3 percent from the fourth quarter of
1984 to the fourth quarter 1985. Growth of exports was particularly
strong at 7.8 percent in that period. Industrial production in January
and February averaged only 0.6 percent above what it had been in January
and February 1985. The unemployment rate rose to 11.5 percent in the
first quarter, a post-War record figure.
The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent (s.a.) in April, bringing
the 12-month inflation rate to 6.5 percent, the lowest such figure in
more than 13 years. The wholesale price index in February dropped 1.3
percent (s.a.), bringing the 12-month rate of increase of wholesale
prices to 2.5 percent. This drop resulted primarily from falling energy
prices.
The trade deficit in the first quarter was $3.1 billion, compared
with a deficit of $3.8 billion a year ago. Lower energy prices were
largely responsible for the improvement.
On April 24, Italian authorities lowered the discount rate from 14
to 13 percent. This is the second time in as many months that the
discount rate has been lowered. The April auction of Treasury bills was
fully subscribed, as investors have responded to lowered inflation
expectations. As the ceilings on commercial bank lending that were put

into effect in January as a part of the package to support the lira are
value to expire in June, commercial banks have already begun to lower

The Netherlands government anticipates a decline of about $4.5
billion in its 1987 revenues derived from natural gas production owing
:o the general decline in energy prices, reduced export volume, and the
lecline in the dollar. (Gas revenues are received by the Treasury with
a lag of about one year.) The cabinet has approved a $3.7 billion
package of spending cuts and tax increases in response; however, if no
further action beyond the approved package is taken, the budget deficit
would rise from about 6-1/2 percent of GNP in 1986 to about 7-1/2
percent in 1987.

Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries. Several major
borrowing countries are encountering difficulties in fiscal management
and containment of inflation as they attempt to maintain an adequate
degree of macroeconomic discipline. Argentina probably missed some of
the first quarter performance criteria of its IMF program, jeopardizing
an IMF drawing and a disbursement from commercial banks. Prices and
wages have begun to rise at a somewhat faster pace than they did
immediately following introduction of the Austral Plan. In Brazil,
prices remain steady two months into its stabilization program, but
signs of overheating may now be appearing. Mexico's 1986 financing
plans continue to be complicated by the fall in world oil prices; a trip
by Mexico's Finance Secretary to Japan failed to generate commitments
for new external financing. On April 23, the President of Venezuela
invoked the contingency clause of Venezuela's rescheduling agreement
with commercial banks, allowing a reconsideration of terms in the event
of a change in the country's economic situation (in this case, the
continued weakness in world oil markets). In Peru, the Garcia govern-
ment has made a number of conciliatory gestures to its external
creditors, including token payments against its arrears to the IMF, the
U.S. government, and--for the first time--commercial banks.
Individual Country Notes. Reports from Argentina suggest that
Argentina failed to meet some of the first-quarter performance criteria
of its twice-revised IMF program. Such a failure could jeopardize the
disbursement of the last drawing of SDR 235 million under the IMF
agreement and of the remaining $600 million under the $4.2 billion loan
from foreign commercial banks signed last summer. The government

IV-26
continued the partial relaxation of the freeze of prices, wages, and
exchange rates introduced in June 1985. On the basis of adjustments in
early April, public and private sector workers are likely to receive
wage increases for the rest of the year in the 18-25 percent range.
Public sector prices were increased by an average of 5 percent and the
government announced that they would be increased each month in the
future by an average of 2 percent. Also, a mini-devaluation policy was
announced, under which the official austral price of the dollar has been
increased by 6-1/4 percent in three steps since April 7. The CPI rose
by 4.6 percent in March and by 4.7 percent in April--an annual rate of
nearly 60 percent--while wholesale prices rose by 3 percent in April
following a 1.4 percent increase in March. In the previous eight
months, the average monthly rate of increase was 2.9 percent for the CPI
and 0.5 percent for wholesale prices. In response to the increase in
inflation, in early May the central bank tightened monetary conditions
by increasing reserve requirements for commercial banks and resumed
selling central bank paper in the market.
In late April, Argentina and its bank advisory committee agreed on
a 180-day rollover of $3.9 billion of dollar-denominated bonds and
promissory notes coming due over the next four years and an estimated
$2.8 billion of other public and private sector debts coming due this
year. A more permanent arrangement is to be negotiated this summer in
the context of Argentina's overall financing program for 1986.
As a result of the price freeze instituted in Brazil on February 28
as part of an anti-inflationary program, prices dropped by 0.1 percent
in March. Preliminary reports indicate that prices rose by about 0.5

IV-27
percent in April. However, there are indications that the economy is
overheating because of strong consumer and government demand, and
shortages of various goods have been reported. Surveys indicate that
wage settlements have tended to be higher than the minimum set by the
government package and this is likely to contribute further to strong
consumer demand. In March, the monetary base grew by 36 percent and M1
grew by 75 percent. This surge in money growth may be largely due to a
new willingness to hold money balances in a period of expected price
stability. Real GDP is now expected to grow by 7 percent in 1986, as
compared with earlier forecasts in the 4-5 percent range. In 1985, real
GDP grew by 8.3 percent. On the external side, the trade balance
remained strong with a surplus estimated at $3.7 billion in the first
four months of 1986 compared with a surplus of $2.9 billion in the
year-earlier period.
In late April, Mexico's Finance Secretary Silva-Herzog travelled to
Japan seeking financing of up to $1 billion for an oil pipeline and
refinery expansion project, a steel mill expansion, and an export
promotion project that would be co-financed by the World Bank. He noted
that, as a result of the oil price decline and the appreciation of the
yen against the dollar, Japan would save about $1 billion this year on
its oil purchases from Mexico. However, he did not obtain any
commitment.
Mexico is refraining from approaching its creditor banks with a
firm proposal for 1986 financing until negotiations are concluded with
the IMF for an expected two-year program and with the World Bank for a

IV-28
$500 million trade policy loan that would be conditional on new steps to
liberalize imports.
Since last November, when ceilings on bank lending were imposed,
domestic credit conditions in Mexico have been very tight and business
firms have brought back funds from abroad to meet local obligations.
This has helped to bolster international reserves and to narrow the gap
between the controlled and free-market exchange rates. On May 12, the
gap was 2.9 percent. As the gap narrowed, the rate of crawl of the peso
in the controlled market has slowed somewhat. In April, it averaged 1
peso per day, after reaching a peak of 1.26 pesos per day in February.
On May 12, the peso price of the dollar in the controlled market was 137
percent higher than a year earlier. In April, the CPI rose by 5.2
percent, and was 71 percent higher than a year earlier.
On February 26, 1986, Venezuela signed its long-delayed $21.2
billion rescheduling agreement with commercial banks. As part of that
agreement, Venezuela was given additional time to make amortization
payments of about $900 million originally scheduled to be due in 1985
and 1986. An additional downpayment by the government of $750 million
is expected to be made this summer. On April 23, citing the continued
weakness in world oil markets, the President of Venezuela invoked the
"contingency clause" of Venezuela's rescheduling agreement that allows
it to ask for reconsideration of terms in the event of a change in the
country's economic situation. This probably means that Venezuela will
request a rescheduling of public-sector principal payments scheduled for
1987 and 1988. Separately, the Venezuelan government may attempt to
stretch out further the repayment of private sector debt.

The IMF team that visited the Philippines in April made some
progress toward negotiating a new 18-month stand-by arrangement. The
current stand-by arrangement-scheduled to run to June 13, 1986--has
become inoperative. One problem area in the negotiations is the size of
the budget deficit. The Philippine government would like to maintain
its current fiscal stance through the end of 1986. The IMF staff argues
that a large deficit will tend to keep interest rates high and
discourage investment, and is seeking remedial actions under the
stand-by arrangement to reduce the deficit, which the Fund staff
believes could reach 5-1/4 percent of GDP in 1986 compared to 1-1/4
percent of GDP in 1985. At present, it is expected that negotiations
might be completed in time for the IMF Board to approve a new stand-by
for the Philippines in August or September. Recent positive develop-
ments include a net inflow of capital in January-April, which has
reportedly increased international reserves by about $400 million to
$1.5 billion, low inflation with prices in March only 3-1/2 percent
above a year ago, and a decline in the world oil price that is expected
to reduce Philippine oil import costs by about $500 million in 1986. On
April 15, the country's creditor banks approved an extension, from June
30, 1986 to December 31, 1986, of the $925 million new money credit
facility; $350 million of the facility still remains to be disbursed.
In the last four weeks, Peru has made a number of conciliatory
gestures towards its external creditors. First, the Garcia government
made its first substantial payment (SDR 30 million) to the IMF since
August 1985, and it gave firm assurance that Peru's arrears to the Fund
(now about SDR 100 million) would be eliminated by August 15. Because

IV-30
of this assurance, the IMF Executive Board decided not to declare Peru
ineligible to use IMF resources, but to invoke that penalty automa-
tically unless Peru eliminates all arrears by August 15. Second, Peru
made its first interest payment ($18 million) to commercial banks on
its medium- and long-term public sector debt since June 1985. This was
the first payment made by the Garcia administration, which took office
in July 1985. Peru's interest arrears on these debts were about $490
million at the end of April. The government has indicated that it will
present to the bank advisory committee in early June a formal proposal
for rescheduling these debts. Finally, Peru made its first payment to
the U.S. government ($15 million) since September 1985. This payment
was sufficient to lift restrictions on disbursements of U.S. bilateral
assistance that are automatically imposed under U.S. law whenever
debt-service payments to certain U.S. government agencies are overdue by
more than one year. These restrictions will again go into effect in
June if no further payments are made.
