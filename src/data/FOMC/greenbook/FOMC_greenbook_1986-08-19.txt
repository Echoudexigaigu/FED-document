The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Incoming indicators have continued to suggest a sluggish and uneven
pattern of economic activity. The service and construction sectors
continue to benefit from strong demand on the part of households, but
manufacturing still is contracting under the pressure of declining business
investment and strong foreign competition. Wage gains appear to be
moderating gradually, and-apart from the recent energy market developments--
price inflation has remained in check.
Industrial Production
The index of industrial production fell 0.5 percent in June-about
half of the decline being strike related. Since reaching its most recent
peak in January, the index has dropped 2 percent; one-half percentage
point of the decline is attributable to the plunge in drilling activity;
but cutbacks in production of business equipment and durable materials
also have contributed significantly.
Preliminary indicators suggest that the downtrend in production
continued in July. Automobile assemblies were down 400,000 units (annual
rate) last month, and drilling activity was reduced further, albeit, as
in June, by a smaller amount than earlier in the year. More generally,
the July labor market report indicates that production probably declined
in many durable goods industries. By contrast, output of metals and
paper rose last month, and the settlement of the strike against AT&T
probably boosted production of communication equipment.
Capacity utilization declined 0.6 percentage point in June to 78.3
percent. Since reaching its most recent peak in July 1984, utilization
II-1

II-2
has fallen 4 percentage points, with much of the decline occurring during
the first half of this year. The drop in operating rates this year has
been concentrated in the durable manufacturing and mining industries.
Employment and Unemployment
Nonfarm employment, as measured by the establishment survey, rose
390,000 last month; about 150,000 of this increase reflected striking
workers returning to their jobs at AT&T and Alcoa. Led by large gains in
retail trade and services, the number of jobs in the private service-producing
sector grew about 240,000 (strike adjusted). In addition, construction
employment rebounded in July, more than retracing a June decline.
Manufacturing employment, however, continued to fall; cutbacks of more
than 50,000 jobs (strike adjusted) last month brought the cumulative
decline since January to 175,000.
The civilian unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point in
July to 6.9 percent, toward the lower end of the range that has prevailed
over the past year. Much of the improved labor market situation reflected
higher employment levels for adult women. The teenage unemployment rate
also showed an unusually large drop in July. However, the unemployment
rate for adult men has been essentially unchanged for several months,
likely reflecting the weak performance of the goods-producing sector.
Personal Income and Consumption
Real income growth and consumer spending have shown considerable
strength this year. Owing in part to sharp declines in energy prices
and a substantial boost to farm income from government subsidy payments,
disposable personal income, in real terms, rose at an annual rate of
nearly 7 percent in the first half.

II-6
Consumer spending rose at nearly a 5 percent annual rate over the
first half of the year, with substantial gains in spending for a broad
range of goods. Outlays for furniture, other household durables, and
apparel were particularly robust, and auto sales spurted in late spring
in response to enhanced financing incentives. In addition, gasoline
usage surged, as pump prices fell.
In July, retail sales excluding automotive outlets, gasoline stations
and hardware stores (the "retail control" grouping) rose 0.7 percent from
an upward revised June level. Sales remained particularly strong at
furniture and appliance stores. In the auto market, total car sales slipped
to a 10.9 million unit rate in July, as a drop in sales of domestic
models more than offset a strong increase in foreign auto sales.
Business Fixed Investment
After falling sharply in the first quarter, real business fixed
investment declined 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter.
The weakness was centered on the nonresidential structures component, which
fell at an estimated 35 percent annual rate. A portion of this drop
stems from the sharp curtailment of activity related to petroleum drilling,
but declines also occurred in commercial and industrial construction.
The decline in commercial spending probably reflected both the record-high
vacancy rates in most of the country and the widespread anticipation that
Congress will restrict the tax preferences given to investment in these
structures. Spending for industrial buildings has been weak, in part,
owing to excess capacity throughout the economy. New commitments for
nonresidential construction have fallen sharply since late last year,

suggesting that outlays likely will retreat further during the third
quarter.
In contrast to structures, outlays for equipment rose substantially
in the second quarter, led by a rebound in spending for office and computing
equipment. However, this gain only partly reversed a sharp decline in
the first quarter and near-term indicators suggest little prospect of a
significant pickup in demand. New orders for nondefense capital goods
fell for three consecutive months before posting a small gain in June.
Although bookings for office and computing equipment, which account for
almost 20 percent of total equipment spending, rose markedly in May and
June, these gains were from the lowest quarterly level in the past three
years, and anecdotal evidence suggests continued caution in spending for
computers.
Housing
Residential investment expenditures increased sharply in the second
quarter, propelled by the rise in both starts and sales through early
spring. However, indicators have softened recently. Multifamily
starts fell sharply in May and were little changed in June. The lower
pace of multifamily construction partly reflects high vacancy rates;
additional factors include concerns among investors regarding the impact
of tax reform on the yield to rental housing and a lessening effect from
the tax-exempt funds raised last year by state and local governments.
In the single-family sector, starts in the second quarter remained
in the 1-1/4 million unit range, but sales of new and existing houses
fell back in May and June from the exceptionally high levels recorded

II-9
earlier in the year. The falloff in house sales in recent months may be
partly attributable to a backup of mortgage rates of more than three-fourths
of a percentage point (on fixed-rate loans) between April and June. Though
rates edged down slightly since mid-June, they are still about 1/2 percentage
point above their spring low.
In the second quarter, the average price of new single-family
houses sold was 12 percent higher than a year earlier. Adjusting for quality
improvements and changes in the regional mix of sales, however, average
prices were up about 5 percent. Regionally, the largest price increases
were registered in the strong housing markets of the Northeast, where
prices rose sharply for both new and existing houses.
Business Inventories
Business inventory investment apparently slowed markedly in the
second quarter, especially in the trade sector. Auto inventories were
reduced slightly after a large run-up in the preceding half year. In
addition, the available data for nonauto trade inventories point to a sharp
slowing in the rate of accumulation. After rising $18 billion in the first
quarter, these constant-dollar stocks were nearly unchanged, on balance, in
April and May.
In the manufacturing sector, constant-dollar stocks apparently
changed little in the second quarter. The liquidation of the past year
has held the stock-sales ratio at a relatively low level despite the
sluggish performance of factory shipments.

The Federal Government
Increased spending on defense and farm subsidies helped push total
federal expenditures up $38 billion in the second quarter. Federal spending
has been particularly variable over the past year, largely because of
unevenness in spending for defense and farm programs. The volatility in
defense spending is largely attributable to discrete jumps in the delivery
rates of major new procurement items. For example, deliveries of B1 bombers
and M1 tanks increased during the second quarter, and the first MX missiles
were delivered. Current production schedules suggest some further increases
in delivery rates in the near term and a leveling off thereafter. In
addition, this year's farm program authorized advance income payments to
farmers, which produced a surge in subsidy payments in the second quarter.
On the revenue side, the slow growth of receipts during the first and
second quarters reflects the sluggishness of taxable incomes and the
disappearance of windfall profits tax revenues because of falling oil
prices.
Action on the budget, though considerably behind the schedule
specified in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, has picked up in recent
weeks. The House, where appropriations bills originate, has passed 6 of
the 13 regular appropriations bills; the Senate, however, has not yet
acted on any of these bills. The Senate has passed a bill to increase
the debt ceiling; this bill includes an amendment that would restore the
automatic mechanism to cut outlays-ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court. There is, however, substantial opposition to this amendment in
the House, and a short-term extension of the debt ceiling may be required

while this issue is debated. In addition, a conference committee is
working to reconcile the Senate and House versions of the tax reform
bill. Consideration of reconciliation legislation in the House and
Senate that would cut the deficit about $9 billion in 1987 and $24 billion
over three years has been postponed until Congress reconvenes from its
Labor Day recess.
The administration and the CBO recently released new estimates of
their economic and budget projections for FY 1986 through 1991; these are
discussed in an appendix.
State and Local Government Sector
State and local government spending strengthened in the second
quarter, but employment gains have slowed and fiscal positions of states
generally have weakened somewhat. Real outlays advanced 7-3/4 percent at
an annual rate in the second quarter versus a gain of 2-1/2 percent in
the first quarter. Most of the second-quarter increase was attributable
to a surge in construction spending in May. Monthly employment gains
have been averaging 8,500 during the past four months, less than half as
much as during the first quarter of this year and substantially below the
pace in 1985.
Indicators of state fiscal positions point to some further
deterioration for the sector as a whole. For fiscal year 1986, 18 states
reduced planned general-funds outlays, and 9 already have sliced planned
fiscal 1987 expenditures; a few states are expecting to spend less in
1987 than they did in 1986. One early estimate of state finances indicates
that the general funds cash balance for the states as a whole will be
close to zero in fiscal 1987.

II-15
Prices
Recent patterns of price change have reflected the gyrations in
energy prices, with the consumer price index for all urban consumers up
1/2 percent in June and the producer price index for finished goods
unchanged. Over the first half of this year, the CPI declined slightly
and the PPI substantially, owing largely to the sharp decline in
petroleum product prices.
A June pickup in energy prices at the consumer level reflected
advances for gasoline, electricity, and natural gas, which more than offset
continued declines for fuel oil. Retail prices of gasoline tend to
respond fairly quickly to changes in spot prices of petroleum and refinery
products; these prices weakened considerably in domestic and world
markets after mid-June, but have responded to the recent OPEC agreement
with sharp climbs. Prices of service fuels, however, have adjusted more
slowly to the lower price level for petroleum products.
Food prices also had a restraining influence on the CPI in the
first half, rising at an average annual rate of only 1.0 percent. In
June, food prices in the CPI edged up 0.1 percent, as fresh fruit and
vegetable prices turned down, largely offsetting advances for meats,
poultry, and other categories.
At the farm level, crop and livestock prices have followed widely
divergent patterns in recent months. Declines in crop output this year,
partly stemming from policy-induced reductions in acres planted, probably

will not be large enough to make a serious dent in the huge stockpiles
that have hung over the market for the past two years. Consequently, with
price support levels for the major crops being reduced substantially in
an effort to boost exports, crop prices have fallen sharply. Livestock
prices, in contrast, have strengthened substantially in recent months
especially for hogs and poultry. Poultry output has been affected,
probably temporarily, by the drought in the Southeast, and a cyclical
contraction in the hog sector has limited marketings.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose 0.3 percent in June,
after rising only fractionally in May. Prices of commodities less
food and energy edged up 0.1 percent, as further declines for used cars
and apparel nearly offset increases for new cars and other items. Recent
price hikes for new cars, including both domestic and imported models,
have raised that index to a level about 4-1/2 percent above a year earlier.
By contrast, used car prices have declined at about a 7 percent rate so
far this year.
Prices of nonenergy services rose 0.4 percent in June. Price
increases for auto insurance and medical care remained large, and a
scheduled rise in local access charges boosted the cost of telephone
service. Compared with June 1985, nonenergy service prices were up 5-3/4
percent, similar to the previous twelve-month pace.
According to the BLS, prices of imported consumer goods other than
autos rose 4 percent (not annual rate) over the first six months of 1986
and 7 percent over the past 12 months. Although import prices have
spurted for consumer goods such as tape recorders, photographic equipment,

watches, and optical goods, much of the increase apparently is being
absorbed by domestic distributors.
In the capital equipment area, prices of domestically-produced
goods have shown little change over the past year, while according to the
BLS survey, import prices of a wide range of machinery and equipment rose
at double-digit rates in the year ending in June 1986. Prices of
intermediate materials, less food and energy, have continued to show
little change, on balance, over the past year and a half. By contrast,
prices of crude nonfood materials, less energy, were up in June as well
as over the first half of this year, after declining during most of 1984
and 1985. This index shows prices rising for such items as domestic
logs, wastepaper, and scrap metal.
Wages and Labor Costs
Available measures of labor costs provide different indications of
the current rate of wage inflation, but all point to continued restraint
so far this year. The hourly earnings index was little changed July,
after rising at a 2-1/4 percent rate in the first half of this year.
In contrast, the wage and salary component of the employment cost index,
a more comprehensive measure, continues to show wage increases close to 4
percent, primarily reflecting relatively large increases for nonproduction
and supervisory workers who are excluded from the hourly earnings index.
The ECI measure of overall hourly compensation, which includes employer
costs as well as wages and salaries, also has been rising at just under a
4 percent rate, as moderation in the growth of fringe benefits has accompanied
the deceleration in wages.

II-21
The unionized sector continues to be a source of wage restraint.
In the first half of 1986, effective wage change was less than 3 percent,
most of which reflected wage adjustments negotiated under prior contracts;
COLA payments were nearly nonexistent in the first half of this year.
In general, settlements this year have been far less generous than
the contracts they replaced. New settlements for the 1 million private
industry workers bargaining so far this year averaged just 1.2 percent in
the first contract year and 1.9 percent annually over the life of the
contract, exclusive of lump-sum payments and COLAs. Much of the deceleration
in average first-year adjustments can be explained by the large number of
workers not receiving a wage increase. More than 40 percent of workers
covered by new settlements so far this year accepted initial wage cuts or
freezes, the highest percentage since 1982. However, 30 percent of
workers negotiating new settlements in the first half of this year
will receive lump-sum payments in lieu of wage increases. These payments,
which averaged about 3 percent of salary in 1985, currently are excluded
from straight-time measures such as the hourly earning index and the wage
and salary component of the ECI, but are included as part of total hourly
compensation.
Along with favorable compensation trends, there has been some
improvement in productivity growth. Output per hour in the nonfarm
business sector has risen 1.1 percent over the past year, compared
with just 0.2 percent over the preceding four quarters.

ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
BUDGET UPDATES
Official projections of economic and budget prospects were updated
last week with the release of the administration's Mid-Session Review of the
1987 Budget and the Congressional Budget Office's The Economic and Budget
Outlook: An Update. These reports take into account the legislative,
economic, technical estimating and policy developments that have occurred
since the FY1987 budget was submitted last February. Based on these develop-
ments, both the administration and the CBO have revised their estimate of
the fiscal 1986 deficit upward; they have made revisions in opposite direc-
tions for 1987 but both agencies have lowered their deficit projections for
the years beyond 1987.
Most of the revisions to the economic assumptions of the administration
and CBO, shown in table 1, merely incorporate recent developments--the greater-
than-expected deceleration of inflation, lower interest rates, and slow real
growth--into the 1986 and 1987 forecast. The contours of the longer-run
forecast are about unchanged from February, with the exceptions of somewhat
slower real growth and slightly lower interest rates now being projected by
CBO. The negative effect of lower inflation and real growth on tax revenues is,
however, offset in the CBO assumption by an upward revision in the share of
GNP that is subject to personal and corporate taxes. Both the administration
and CBO continue to be optimistic about the continuation of the recovery;
but the overall outlook of the administration forecast is more optimistic,
including a substantially higher growth rate of potential output implicit
in its real growth and employment projections, and a steeper downtrend in
inflation and interest rates.
The revised administration and CBO current services or baseline
budget projections are summarized in table 2. Current services and baseline
projections are estimates of the revenues and spending that would occur if
no policy changes were made. Most taxes and spending for entitlements are
projected on the basis of current law tax rates and spending formulas.
Nondefense discretionary spending is projected at the level that would
maintain real program services. The administration usually includes defense
spending at the level specified in its most recent policy proposal. However,
for the Mid-Session Review the administration has reduced the budget authority
assumed for 1987 to the level specified in the FY1987 congressional budget
resolution, but it assumes that after 1987 budget authority grows at the
3 percent real growth specified in the February budget (and in the FY1986
congressional budget resolution that was adopted by Congress in August
1985). The CBO, on the other hand, usually includes defense at a level
that reflects congressional policy. In its February projections, the CBO
rejected the defense spending path specified in the FY1986 budget resolution
because of the subsequent enactment of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Reduction Act.

Division of Research and Statistics.

It interpreted congressional intent as specifying zero real growth of
defense appropriations. This assumption was retained in the August
update.
As the table shows, a sharp decline in the current services
deficit is now being projected by both the CBO and the administration--
from $224 or $230 billion in 1986 to less than $70 billion in 1991.
The decline is steeper than that projected in the February budget
documents and is in marked contrast to the steady or rising deficits
that were being projected last August (see the memo lines of the
table). The downward revisions of the long-range deficit projections
since last August are partly the result of spending restraint--including
a scaling back of the proposed size of the defense build-up--and minor
revenue increases that have been adopted by Congress and the admini-
stration over the past year. In addition, favorable economic develop-
ments, primarily lower interest rates and inflation, have cut the
growth of outlays.
The sources of the revisions to the February deficit estimates
are summarized in table 3. The administration's estimate of the FY1986
deficit was revised up because of higher than expected defense spend-out
rates, major technical reestimates of farm price support and FDIC and
FSLIC deposit insurance payments, and the lower than expected growth
of taxable incomes. In the years beyond 1986 the deficit is smaller
primarily because lower inflation reduced proposed defense spending
and because of nondefense spending cuts and tax increases that were
enacted in the Comprehensive Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985
(COBRA). The CBO also has revised its 1986 deficit estimate because
of weak income growth and high farm and deposit insurance payments.
In the out years, CBO adjustments to the defense baseline are much
smaller than the administration's, apparently taking the lower infla-
tion assumption into account only for pay estimates. On the other
hand, the CBO made larger deficit adjustments based on revised economic
assumptions; the share of taxable income in national income is assumed
to be greater than in the February report and assumed interest rates
are a bit lower. CBO technical reestimates about offset the effect
of COBRA on the deficit projection in the years beyond FY1986.
Table 4 summarizes the additional deficit-reducing actions that
have been proposed by the administration in the Mid-Session Review
and by Congress in its FY1987 Budget Resolution. The admininistration
estimates that its proposed initiatives would be sufficient to hold
the deficit below the GrammRudman targets. However, many economic
forecasts current in the private sector would imply higher deficits
and there has been substantial resistance in Congress to many of the
administration's deficit cutting proposals. On the other hand,
congressional policy, when reestimated by the CBO, also exceeds the
Gramm-Rudman targets.
It should be noted that the Gramm-Rudman sequester report which
is due on August 20 will be based on a different baseline concept

II-A-3
than the administration and CBO estimates discussed above. The
Gramm-Rudman tax and spending estimates will be based only on currently
enacted legislation. If new appropriations for a program or agency
are not yet enacted, appropriation levels from the previous year would
be assumed (none of the 1987 appropriation bills have yet cleared
Congress); that is, there would be no adjustment for maintaining
real program services as in the CBO baseline and administration
current services budget, nor would defense be estimated at proposed
policy levels. The CBO estimates that the 1987 deficit computed on a
Gramm-Rudman basis would be about $173 billion and OMB officials have
indicated that their estimates will probably be between $160 and $170
billion. A reconciliation bill that would cut about $9 billion
from these estimates will be considered by the House and Senate in
early September. This bill would go a long way toward bringing the
deficit estimate down toward the $154 billion 1987 trigger for a
sequester under Gramm-Rudman (the sequester process is triggered when
the estimated deficit exceeds the $144 billion deficit target by more
than $10 billion).

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The discount rate was cut from 6-1/2 to 6 percent shortly after the
July FOMC meeting, but other interest rates have not registered comparable
declines. Yields on 3- to 6-month money market instruments generally have
eased around one-fourth to three-eighths percentage point, while bond
yields are mostly unchanged to a bit higher over the intermeeting period.
The discount rate change had been widely anticipated, but several other
factors also worked to hold up market rates. Until recent days when
rumors have circulated about discussions of new coordinated actions, the
failure of other central banks to match the July discount rate move and
the weakness of the dollar--along with the stress placed by U.S. officials
on the role of foreign demand in bolstering growth here-seemed to dim
hopes of further Federal Reserve easing steps. In addition, the OPEC oil
supply initiative, coming on the heels of a larger-than-expected June CPI
increase, emphasized the importance of energy prices in recent disinflation
and had a moderate, bearish effect on the fixed-income markets.
A pickup in the growth of M2 and M3 in July moved these aggregates
to the upper portions of their annual target ranges. Growth of the broader
aggregates was given considerable impetus by a surge in overnight RPs
associated with record acquisitions of U.S. government securities by
commercial banks. M1 continued to grow rapidly, with strong increases
in demand deposits and other checkable deposits.
Apart from a drop-off in Treasury borrowing on a seasonally adjusted
basis, aggregate credit growth appears to be well maintained in the current
quarter. Net borrowing by nonfinancial firms slowed in July as the use of
short-term credit was weak and bond issuance receded from the torrid pace

in the spring. Fragmentary data on the household sector suggest that the
growth of home mortgage debt is continuing at a rapid rate, but that
growth of installment loans may be slowing further. Meanwhile, however,
state and local government borrowing has soared once again, with bonds
being rushed to market ahead of proposed new restrictions that could
become effective on September 1, depending on developments in the tax
reform arena.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 accelerated in July to a 13 percent annual rate of growth, owing
largely to a surge in the issuance of overnight RPs, apparently to finance
massive acquisitions of Treasury securities by large commercial banks in
late June and early July. Among other M2 components, relative interest rate
movements again favored the more liquid items. Yields on money market
mutual fund shares have lagged the decline in market rates, leading to
strong inflows into these instruments. The same is true of savings deposits
and MMDAs, which rose rapidly while runoffs of small time deposits extended
into July. Since late 1984, the share of small time accounts in M2 has
drifted down almost 5 percentage points to 33 percent; in contrast, the
share of liquid interest-bearing instruments (including OCDs, savings
deposits, MMDAs, and MMMFs) has risen over the same period from 43 percent
to almost 48 percent of M2.
The continued rapid growth of M1 obviously has been a significant
part of the shift toward liquid monetary assets. Growth of M1 in July, at
an annual rate of 17 percent, was only a little below the change between
March and June. The expansion was paced by continued strong inflows to
OCDs as yield spreads between OCDs and less liquid alternatives were

squeezed to their narrowest levels since the introduction of nationwide
NOW accounts; for example, at commercial banks rates on 6-month small
time accounts were less than 75 basis points above Super NOW rates late
in July, compared with around 150 basis points in the latter part of 1985.
Growth of demand deposits remained strong in July.
M3 rose at an annual rate of 13 percent in July, the highest monthly
figure this year. A sharp rebound in the non-M2 component contributed to
the increase. Inflows to institution-only money funds bulged in July,
reflecting the lagging adjustment of their yields to the decline in market
rates. Substantial issuance of large time deposits by thrifts also was an
important factor, as institutions regulated by the FHLBB sought to bolster
their liability base in light of a proposal for higher capital requirements
that would restrain their future growth. Commercial banks as a group did
not rely on CDs, but the flatness hides a continued runoff at banks under
pressure from problems in the energy industry and other troubled sectors.
Business loan demand has been quite weak in recent months, but
overall bank credit picked up in July owing to the buildup in holdings of
U.S. government securities. Banks continued to acquire other securities,
perhaps to take advantage of attractive yields on tax-exempt issues. Real
estate loans again increased briskly in July while consumer loans continued
to grow relatively slowly, owing in part to the competition from captive
auto finance companies. The volatile securities loan category bounced up
in July, adding a bit to total asset accumulation.
Business Finance
Overall short-term credit use by nonfinancial firms has remained
weak. Business loans at commercial banks, including loans from offshore

branches of U.S. banks, were flat in July and commercial paper of nonfinan-
cial firms resumed its decline after an uptick in June. Although firms
are still borrowing to finance mergers and restructurings, the slack demand
for short-term credit reflects the limited need for external capital to
finance inventories and fixed investment. Short-term borrowing might have
been even weaker recently if bond yields had not backed up from their
April lows and encouraged some deferral of long-term financings.
Although still heavy by historical standards, bond offerings of
nonfinancial firms have tapered off from the tremendous pace earlier in
the year. With the higher level of long-term interest rates, moreover, the
proportion of nonfinancial corporate bonds with maturities of 20 years or
longer has contracted-to 35 percent of domestic issuance in July versus
the peak of 50 percent in the first quarter. (Interest rates on inter-
mediate-term bonds have increased less than those at the long end of
the market.) The market has remained receptive to low-rated or unrated
bonds, and these issues represented about 35 percent of the total domestic
corporate bond volume in July, compared with about 20 percent in the
first quarter.1
Most major stock price indexes have declined as much as 9 percent
since hitting record highs at the beginning of July. The gross issuance
of new equity has tapered off with the decline in stock prices; the July
volume was the lowest since January. Initial public offerings of new

LTV declared bankruptcy. A total of $2.2 billion of bonds, much reportedly
held by mutual funds specializing in high-yield bonds, went into default
simultaneously as a result of this bankruptcy. The bonds had not been
issued in connection with recent mergers, but rather were mostly debt of
operating companies that was outstanding when the firms were acquired by
LTV.

equity also have slowed sharply, with the July volume only about 20 percent
of the amount brought to market in the second quarter. Enormous amounts
of outstanding stock still are being absorbed in mergers, buyouts, and
restructurings, and net equity issuance has remained deeply negative-
accounting for the bulk of business borrowing needs.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff is projecting a combined federal budget deficit for the
current quarter of $58 billion, bringing the estimated deficit for fiscal
year 1986 to $225 billion. This projection is about in line with the
recent budget outlook published by the Congressional Budget Office, but
it is about $5 billion below the estimate of the Administration. The
lower estimate of the staff compared with the Administration reflects
both higher receipts and lower expenditures in several categories. In
financing the deficit this quarter, the Treasury is expected to borrow
about $48 billion in the market and to draw down its cash balance slightly.
Nonmarketable borrowing will provide $4-1/2 billion of financing-considerably
less than in other recent quarters, partly because the amount of securities
sold to state and local governments has weakened. As the yields on tax-
exempt securities have increased relative to Treasury rates (many tax-
exempt securities recently have carried higher yields than Treasury issues),
state and local authorities have been able to invest the proceeds in market
instruments until they are needed, without violating arbitrage restrictions.1
1. When the proceeds of an advance refunding bond are invested in Treasury
securities, the new bonds are backed by the revenues of the particular project
being financed or by the state and local government, and the old bonds are
backed by the Treasury security. In technical terms, the old bonds are said to
be defeased. When the proceeds of an advance refunding are invested in a non-
Treasury security, the old bond continues to be backed by the revenues from
the particular project or by the state and local government, while the new
bonds are backed by the escrowed market security purchased with its proceeds.
In these cases, the revenue or government backing for the securities crosses
over to the new issue when the old bond is retired.

III-10
The Treasury's financing activities have been disrupted this quarter
because of the statutory debt ceiling. The current ceiling was reached
on August 1, and the Treasury began to rely on the $15 billion borrowing
authority of the Federal Financing Bank, issuing FFB debt to government
trust accounts and redeeming nonmarketable securites. The resultant room
will be close to exhausted, however, when the Treasury raises $13-3/4
billion, net, with the settlement of the midquarter refunding on August 15.
Already the Treasury has paid down bills to ensure that the refunding
could be held. At this point, it appears as though the Congress plans to
pass a temporary increase in the debt ceiling before its Labor Day recess
and to consider a permanent increase and other budget matters when it
reconvenes. Absent a temporary increase, the Treasury is expected to
have sufficient cash to maintain operations through the month of August
but would be unable to cover its large expenditures (such as social security
benefits) in early September before the Congress reconvenes.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies in the third
quarter is estimated to be only slightly higher than in the preceding
quarter, with the Federal Home Loan Banks again more than accounting for the
net issuance. The FHLBs have sold large amounts of debt since March as
the demand for advances by thrift institutions generally has been strong.
Fannie Mae's outstanding debt has been flat recently as the firm has been
raising funds by selling older, fixed-rate mortgages from its portfolio.
The Farm Credit Banks continue to pay down debt as their loan portfolios
shrink.
In the past few months, gross issuance by the FHLBs and FNMA has
been heavy in the 7- to 10-year maturity range; under this pressure, the

III-11
spread between rates on 10-year sponsored agency securities and Treasury
securities has widened to about 75 basis points from roughly 30 basis
points earlier in the year. In contrast, spreads on securities with
shorter maturities (5 years and under) have changed only slightly. Rate
spreads over Treasuries on the securities of the Farm Credit Banks also
have been about unchanged in recent weeks, despite the publication of
negative financial results for the second quarter.
Tax-Exempt Securities Markets
Issuance of tax-exempt bonds increased sharply in July and is likely
to rise even further in August. The July volume reached nearly $20
billion, the largest amount for any month except during the fourth quarter
of last year. The surge this summer, like the one last fall, represents
an effort on the part of issuers to beat regulatory deadlines. Also,
tax-exempt bond volume in both periods was boosted by a large volume of
refunding issues as the rates on tax-exempt bonds were quite low compared
with those issued earlier in the decade. However, unlike the rush last
year-which involved primarily private-purpose debt-the current surge in
gross issuance is composed almost entirely of public-purpose offerings.
In mid-March, congressional and Treasury leaders postponed to
September 1 the effective date on public-purpose bond restrictions
contained in the House tax reform bill (H.R. 3838). State and local
governments are coming to market now in an effort to avoid restrictions
that, if legislation along the lines of H.R. 3838 were enacted, would
tighten arbitrage restrictions, require that the proceeds of bond sales
be spent more quickly, and further limit the amount of funds that could
benefit private entities in a public financing.

The recent surge in bond volume has occurred in the face of continued
uncertainty among investors about the future tax status of municipal
securities issued this year, as well as the tax situation for the investors
themselves. The ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields has declined somewhat
in recent weeks, however, as investor interest reportedly has been piqued
by the possibility that such attractive rates may not be available after
September 1.
Hampered by tax reform, and because tax-exempt rates are not much
different from taxable rates, a number of governmental units have marketed
private-purpose issues with taxable yields. The state of Illinois, the
Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, and two governmental agencies in
Louisiana sold private-purpose taxable debt, and agencies in at least
four other states are planning similar taxable bond sales. Such issues
totaled about $300 million in July and will exceed that amount in August.
Mortgage Markets
Total mortgage debt outstanding is estimated to have expanded at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 10 percent during the second quarter,

III-13
about the same as the upward revised pace of the previous three-month
period. A surge in lending for single-family dwellings contributed to a
rebound in residential debt growth, while a decline in mortgage debt
secured by farms and a slowing in construction of commercial properties
led to a falloff in nonresidential debt growth. Growth of residential
mortgage debt in the first half of the year probably was restrained some
by the volume of mortgage refinancings. These transactions apparently
have involved little net debt expansion, for it appears that most homeowners
have not used refinancing as a vehicle for tapping much existing equity in
their homes; at the same time, the delays in other transactions caused by
the surge in refinancings have cut into net credit growth for home purchases.
The pooling of mortgage loans into pass-through securities has con-
tinued at a remarkable pace in the past few months. In the second quarter,
more than 60 percent of the net change in residential loans was in the
federally related mortgage pool category. New issues of pass-through
securities carrying a payment guarantee by GNMA, FHLMC, or FNMA totaled
almost $50 billion in June and July--equal to nearly half of last year's
volume. Issuance of these securities has been stimulated by the robust
pace of loan originations during the spring as well as by the renewed
dominance of the fixed-rate home mortgage. Thrift institutions have
acquired a large amount of mortgage-backed securities because of their
liquidity and their acceptance as collateral for borrowing.
The rate of growth in residential mortgage debt may well reach a
peak in the current quarter. At FSLIC-insured thrifts, new commitments
to originate mortgage loans in June appear to have leveled off. Weekly
HUD surveys of large mortgage companies indicate a moderation in the number

(NSA) of home loan applications received during July. While these data
evidently reflect in large part a slowdown in refinancing requests, they
also are consistent with the plateauing of single-family housing starts
since February and the recent slackening in the pace of home sales.
Costs of credit in the primary mortgage market have declined somewhat
during the intermeeting period. For conventional home mortgages at S&Ls,
average interest rates on commitments for 30-year, fixed-rate loans have
come down by 20 basis points since early July-but at 10.4 percent are
still one-half percentage point above their spring lows. Initial rates on
one-year ARMs have subsided by a smaller amount.
Reflecting the relatively narrow spreads between fixed- and variable-
rate credit, as well as the level of mortgage rates, ARMs continue to
account for a small share of new lending. At major lenders in early
July, only 22 percent of conventional loans closed for the purchase of a
single-family home carried adjustable rates, compared with about half
during 1985.
Consumer Installment Credit
Growth of consumer installment credit in June slowed to an annual
rate of 11 percent, and growth in the first half of the year averaged
about 12 percent. Compared with last year's experience, the expansion of
consumer credit this year clearly has moderated, reflecting some
slackening in the growth of nominal consumer expenditures, a reduced
proportion of outlays for durable goods, and probably expanding repayments
on debt incurred in prior years. In addition, a reduction in the average
maturity of new-auto loans at finance companies from 52 months in December
to 49-1/2 months in June is boosting monthly repayments and thereby

damping the growth rate of total consumer installment credit. For July,
a reduction in auto sales and a further slowdown in consumer loan growth
at large commercial banks suggests continued deceleration in consumer
installment credit.
Several offerings were made during June and July of pass-through
securities collateralized by automobile credit receivables, including a
$755 million issue by GMAC. Other offerings by Chrysler Financial Corpo-
ration, Nissan Motors Acceptance Corporation, and Empire Savings of
America amounted to a total of $628 million. These offerings typically
include generous recourse provisions. Initial yields on the securities
ranged from 7.42 percent on the Chrysler issue (rated AAA) to 8.04 percent
on the most recent GMAC issue (rated AA+). The outstanding amount of
such securities in late July was about $3.7 billion.1
The average delinquency rate on finance company auto loans declined
to 1.94 percent in the second quarter from 2.01 percent in the first
quarter of 1986, after moving up fairly rapidly from mid-1984 through
early 1986. In recent quarters, the finance company auto loan delinquency
rate has been near the midpoint of the historical range for this series.
1. The installment debt series has yet to be restructured to reflect the
emergence of this channel of credit provision; the data on consumer loans
currently are tabulated in such a way that the credit is attributed to
the institution selling the receivables rather than to the buyer of the
security.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting, the weighted-average foreign
exchange value of the dollar has declined nearly 3 percent, as shown in
the upper panel of the chart. Lackluster U.S. economic statistics
together with the Federal Reserve's unilateral reduction in its discount
rate on July 10 contributed to the view that U.S. monetary authorities
were willing to accept a lower dollar, partly to prod German and
Japanese policymakers to stimulate their economies. This perception was
reinforced by remarks of U.S. officials indicating that further dollar
depreciation was needed to redress the trade imbalance. Statements by
the Japanese and German finance ministers favoring a consolidation of
exchange rates near current levels provided only temporary support for
the dollar.
Short-term interest rates abroad were little changed during the
intermeeting period, while comparable U.S. interest rates declined by
about 40 basis points. At the long end of the maturity spectrum,
the differentials between U.S. and German and Japanese interest rates on
balance were about unchanged.
On a bilateral basis, the dollar displayed diverse movements
against the major currencies, as illustrated in the lower panel of the
chart. During the intermeeting period the dollar's value depreciated
4-3/4 percent in terms of the mark and 3-1/2 percent vis-a-vis the yen,
as incoming data for Germany suggested a rebound in second-quarter
growth, while the outlook for economic activity in Japan remained weak.

fell 3 percent in terms of the dollar and nearly 6 percent on a multi-
lateral trade-weighted basis. Further declines in oil prices early in
the intermeeting period and waning political support for the
Conservative government prompted heavy selling pressure on the pound.
Sterling recovered somewhat along with oil prices following the
announcement of an interim agreement on production quotas by OPEC.
Within the EMS, the mark's divergence below parity with the
French franc narrowed abruptly to about 1/4 percent from the level
of near 2 percent that had prevailed from the realignment on April 6
until early July. Several factors may have motivated this movement in
cross-rates: the general tendency of the mark to appreciate against the
other currencies in the exchange rate system when the dollar
depreciates; the brightening of growth prospects in Germany; and
political frictions between French President Mitterand and the Chirac
government over privitization decrees. In other EMS developments, Irish
authorities devalued the Irish pound by 8 percent within the exchange
rate system on August 2 in an attempt to restore Ireland's competitive
position vis-a-vis the United Kingdom, its major trading partner;
Ireland's loss of competitiveness had stemmed from the sharp
depreciation of sterling against the EMS currencies.

Meanwhile, Australian authorities
raised the rediscount rate -- from a level of 14.7
percent to 18 percent -- and introduced a package liberalizing direct
foreign investment into Australia as well as withdrawing previously
announced withholding taxes on interest earned by non-residents.

IV-5
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States increased
sharply in the second quarter. (See line 4 of the U.S. International
Transactions table.) These increases were concentrated at the G-10
countries and Switzerland and reflected large scale official purchases of
dollars to slow the appreciation of foreign currencies against the dollar
in recent months. Preliminary information indicates that there were
substantial increases in July as well. For the first half of 1986,
investment of official holdings in U.S. Treasury securities more than
matched the increase in official reserves.
In contrast, private foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities (line 3) were relatively small in the second quarter. In
particular, Treasury (TIC) data show that Japanese net private purchases
fell to virtually zero in the first half of 1986, from $17 billion in 1985.
These data, reported by securities dealers in the United States, appear
inconsistent with market commentary which has focused on the large role of
Japanese-based securities dealers at recent Treasury auctions.
While one cannot rule out the possibility of reporting errors in
the TIC system, this does not appear the most likely explanation.
Virtually all major securities dealers, both U.S. and Japanese-based,
reported the same pattern for the first six months of 1986: large
purchases and sales of Treasury securities by Japanese residents, with
little net change in holdings. It appears that the major Japanese
securities firms, in their efforts to become primary U.S. government
securities dealers, have been very active bidders at recent auctions, but
have not sold Treasuries net to Japanese residents or other foreigners.
Despite the lack of Japanese private net purchases, total sales of

Treasury securities to foreigners, official and private, were $27 billion
in the first half of 1986, greater than the amount reported for all of
1985.
Net capital inflows reported through other securities
transactions (line 2) continued at very high levels in the second quarter.
Foreign purchases 'of U.S. corporate bonds totaled $16 billion on a
payments basis (line 2a). However new issues of Eurobonds by U.S.
corporations dropped sharply after April and have remained relatively low
through July while domestic bond issuance by U.S. corporations dropped
less sharply. Apparently Eurobond dealers were caught with large
inventories of unsold bonds when interest rates reversed their downward
trend in April. Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stock (line 2b)
remained at record levels in the second quarter. On the other hand, U.S.
purchases of foreign securities (line 2c) declined from the very strong
first quarter rate.
Participation of U.S firms in the newly developing
Euro-commercial paper market appears to be expanding. Several U.S.
corporations have arranged substantial borrowing programs, although until
recently amounts outstanding appear to have been modest. This situation
may change however, in the wake of an apparently successful new program
for GMAC; GMAC placed about $.5 billion by early July and dealers
speculate that its outstanding may increase to as much as $2.5 billion
this year. Overall data on commercial paper and other short-term
borrowing by U.S. corporations are not collected through the same channels
as other securities transactions; they will be available only with
substantial lags and aggregated with other capital flows (line 8).

IV-8
Net bank reported capital flows (line 1) continued to reverse
directions from month to month; in June there was an outflow of $2.7
billion. In July, as indicated on the International Banking Data table,
line 3, net outflows to related foreign offices and IBFs amounted to over
$6 billion, reflecting continued strong core deposit growth relative to
loan demand at commercial banks.

was as large as in May on an unrevised basis. The staff estimates that
after all the revisions are made and the data are adjusted to a
balance-of-payments basis (column 7), the value of the trade deficit in
the second quarter will be about the same as was recorded in the first

data. Range of revisions for monthly data:
Exports: + 15 billion.
Imports: + 50 billion.
Balance: + 65 billion.
FR staff estimate.
Import figures are based on data for April-May and projections for June.

IV-11
The value of total exports in the second quarter is estimated
to be about unchanged from first-quarter levels. However, a substantial
increase in exports of gold masked declines in agricultural exports and
in most categories of nonagricultural trade. Excluding gold exports,
the volume of nonagricultural exports is estimated to have declined by 1
percent in the second quarter. Gold exports, nearly $10 billion AR in
the second quarter, were largely to Japan to be used in the minting of a
commemorative gold coin. The gold was imported into the United States
over the past six months.
On the import side, the estimates of second-quarter
developments are more tentative because of the size of potential data
revisions. A decline in the value of oil imports resulted from a more
than 35 percent drop in the price of oil that was partly offset by a 20
percent increase in the volume imported (from a low first-quarter
average) as inventories were rebuilt. See the table below.
Uncertainties regarding world oil prices continue to result in wide
swings in imports from quarter to quarter.

IV-12
Nonoil imports are estimated to have risen in value in the
second quarter. About half of the increase resulted from rising import
prices. On a fixed-weight basis, the price of nonoil imports increased
at a 5-1/2 percent rate in the second quarter, the third quarter in a
row of such increases. This rise in the index for all nonoil imports
occurred in spite of continuing declines being recorded for prices of
industrial supplies (which account for 20 percent of nonoil imports).
The strongest price rises were recorded for various manufactured goods,
particularly general industrial machinery (other than computers),
electric machinery and telecommunication equipment, photographic
equipment and passenger cars. For the volume of nonoil imports, the
estimated 1-1/2 percent increase in the second quarter was spread among
various trade categories (machinery, aircraft, passenger cars, consumer
goods and gold) and came from various geographic areas (Japan, Western
Europe, Latin America, and the newly industrialized countries in the Far
East).

IV-13
Foreign Economic Developments. Recent data provide continued evidence
of generally weak economic activity in most of the foreign industrial
countries. Industrial production in Japan grew only 1.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter. In the most recent months for which
data are available, industrial production fell in France, the United
Kingdom, Canada, and Italy. German industrial production picked up
somewhat in the second quarter, but it only retraced its first quarter
decline. French GDP grew 2.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first half.
Inflation abroad continues to moderate. In recent months, consumer
prices have declined in Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. In
France, Canada, and Italy inflation has slowed to levels which are
extremely low by recent historical standards.
Japan and Germany continue to experience record trade surpluses,
and France and Italy have narrowed their trade deficits. In contrast,
the United Kingdom and Canada experienced deteriorating trade balances
in recent months.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, the pace of economic activity
remained sluggish in the second quarter. Industrial production (s.a.)
increased 0.5 percent in June, after having risen 0.3 percent in May and
having remained unchanged in April. In the second quarter, industrial
production on average was slightly above its first quarter level but 0.6
percent below its year-earlier level. In May, new private sector orders
of machinery (s.a.) declined 2.7 percent, while new housing starts
(s.a.) increased 4.7 percent after having declined in the three previous
months. In the first quarter, the consumer sector provided the
principal stimulus to growth, but the preliminary indications of

IV-17
consumer demand in the second quarter are mixed. Retail sales (s.a.)
rose 0.4 percent in April but fell 0.3 percent in May. The unemployment
rate was unchanged in June at 2.7 percent. A Bank of Japan survey of
investment intentions released in May suggests a substantial slowing of
investment. Real investment grew 9 percent in FY 1985, but it is
projected to grow only 4.3 percent in FY 1986.
Japanese consumer prices have been declining in recent months. The
Tokyo consumer price index (n.s.a.) fell 0.8 percent in June and 0.3
percent in July, bringing the index to a level 0.2 percent below that of
a year ago. Wholesale prices have continued to decline, and the overall
wholesale price index fell a record 10.1 percent in June from its year-
ago level. The sharp decline in wholesale prices in June was mainly the
result of reductions in the prices of electric power and gas, reflecting
the yen's appreciation and falling world crude oil prices.
External surpluses remain at record levels. In the first half of
the year, the cumulative current account and trade surpluses were $74.7
billion (s.a.a.r.) and $79.6 billion (s.a.a.r.) respectively. Trade
volumes continue to decline in response to the yen's sharp appreciation
since last year. In June, the export volume index declined 2.3 percent
from its year-earlier level, the fourth consecutive monthly decline.
Import volume has increased in recent months, rising 31.9 percent
between June 1985 and June 1986. Import volume growth is not expected
to continue at this pace, however, because the June figure reflects
sizable imports of gold for the minting of coins commemorating the
sixtieth year of Emperor Hirohito's reign.

IV-18
In the July 6 general parliamentary elections, Prime Minister
Nakasone's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won a landslide victory,
gaining 304 out of 512 seats in the upper house. The margin of victory
was viewed as a personal triumph for Prime Minister Nakasone. Nakasone
appointed Kiichi Miyazawa, a long-time advocate of greater monetary and
fiscal stimulation, as Minister of Finance. It is unclear whether
Miyazawa's appointment signals a major shift in the government's
willingness to provide fiscal stimulus. On the one hand, it is
increasingly likely that the government will propose a record 3 billion
yen supplementary budget this fall to stimulate domestic demand. On the
other hand, the government's initial requests for the FY 1987 budget
indicate a desire to continue its program of fiscal austerity.
Industrial production in Germany rose 2.7 percent (s.a.) in June.
With the substantial downward revision of the May figure, the level of
production in the second quarter was only 1.1 percent above that of the
first quarter and 2.6 percent above its level of a year ago. The rate
of unemployment (s.a.) remained at 9 percent in July. In an unusually
early report, an official of the Finance Ministry put second quarter
real GNP growth at 3 percent above the same quarter of last year. This
would imply a strong rebound from the first quarter slump.
Consumer prices fell another 0.5 percent (n.s.a) in July to a level
0.5 percent below July of last year. The index has fallen at an annual
rate of 1.3 percent in the first seven months of this year. Import
prices in June were 21 percent below their year-earlier level. In July,
wholesale were 8.7 percent (n.s.a.) below their level in July 1985.

IV-19
This year's cumulative trade and current account surpluses
continue at record rates. In the first half of the year, the cumulative
current account surplus has been $30 billion (a.r.), compared with $9.6
billion (a.r) in the same period of last year. These large and growing
external surpluses are primarily due to Germany's improving terms of
trade.
The pace of real economic activity in France slowed in the first
quarter and picked up in the second quarter. Revised data show that
real GDP (s.a.) did not grow at all in the first quarter, but it grew
4.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter. The unemployment rate has
remained at a record high of 10.7 percent from April through June.
Industrial production fell by 5.1 percent (s.a.) in May and was 1.5
percent below its year-earlier level. However, the government
statistical institute attributed the sharp decline in this index to the
unusually large number of national holidays in May. Early indicators
point to a recovery in industrial production in June, especially in the
automobile industry and in the semi-finished goods sector.
The inflation rate continues to be low. Consumer prices increased
only 0.2 percent (n.s.a.) in July following a 0.3 percent rise in June.
The year-over-year consumer price inflation rate in July was 2 percent,
already below the government's inflation target for the end of this
year.
The trade deficit narrowed in June. For the first half of this
year, the trade deficit rate was about $2.1 billion (s.a.a.r.), down
from the $2.9 billion deficit rate in the first half of last year.

IV-20
On July 31, Parliament adopted the conservative government's
privatization bill, which sets conditions for the sale of 65 state-owned
banks, insurance companies, and industrial concerns during the next five
years.
In the United Kingdom, recent data give a somewhat mixed picture
about the strength of economic activity. Industrial production declined
by 1.2 percent (s.a.) in June and was 1.3 percent below its year-earlier
level. The unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage point in June
to 13.1 percent. However, retail sales volume rose by a strong 3.5
percent (s.a.) in June according to provisional figures, a 6.1 percent
increase on a year-over-year basis.
Retail price inflation has continued to moderate. The retail price
index declined by 0.1 percent (n.s.a.) in June, bringing the
year-over-year inflation rate down to 2.5 percent. Other measures of
inflationary pressure present a less favorable picture. Producer prices
in July were 4.4 percent above their year-earlier level, and average
earnings in May were up by 7.2 percent on a year-over-year basis.
The trade deficit continued at a high level in June, while the
current account remained in slight surplus. In the first half of this
year, the cumulative trade deficit was $8.8 billion (s.a.a.r.),
substantially greater than the $3.1 billion deficit in the same period
last year. The current account was in surplus by $3.2 billion
(s.a.a.r.) in the first half of 1986, only slightly below the $4.1
billion current account surplus in the first half of 1985.
Growth in real gross domestic product slowed in Canada to 2.3
percent (s.a.a.r.), in the first quarter of 1986, after having grown 3.8

IV-21
percent on average in 1985. Were it not for a large build-up in
inventories, real GDP would have declined. More recently, industrial
production fell 2 percent (s.a.) in May, reversing part of April's sharp
increase. Furthermore, the unemployment rate rose 0.4 percent (s.a.) in
July, reaching 9.9 percent. Inflation continues to be moderate.
Consumer prices increased 3.7 percent (n.s.a.) over the twelve-month
period ending in June. The industrial product price index was unchanged
in June, bringing the 12-month increase to 0.3 percent (n.s.a.).
Latest data confirm a sharp deterioration in Canada's external
position. Exports fell 6.3 percent (s.a.) in May, but imports fell only
4.4 percent. This brings the cumulative merchandise trade surplus to
$7.5 billion (s.a.a.r.) in May, well below the rate of $15.9 billion
(s.a.a.r.) for the comparable period last year.
In Italy, industrial production rose 1.5 percent (s.a.) in April
and fell by 6.7 percent in May, to a level below what it had been in May
1985. In June, the official government survey showed consumer
confidence in the general state of the economy at a record high. The
unemployment rate in April was 11.3 percent, slightly lower than it was
in January.
The consumer price index was unchanged in July, lowering the
twelve-month inflation rate to 5.9 percent (s.a.), the lowest such
figure since 1973. The wholesale price index dropped 0.7 percent
(n.s.a.) in May and was unchanged in June, leaving this index 1.8
percent below its year-earlier level.

IV-22
During the first six months of 1986, the trade deficit was $5.9
billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with a deficit of $15 billion (s.a.a.r.) in
the first six months of 1985.
On August 8, Bettino Craxi's new coalition government received a
vote of confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, ending the political
crisis that had lasted for 40 days. Craxi agreed to relinquish control
of the coalition to the Christian Democrats in the spring of 1987. The
Ministers of Treasury and Finance are unchanged, and the new government
is not expected to institute any substantially different economic
policies from those of the old.

IV-23
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries. On July 22,
Mexico signed a letter of intent for an 18-month IMF stand-by
arrangement. Brazil announced measures designed to restrain domestic
demand and to encourage the holding of longer-term securities.
Venezuela's Congress approved legislation establishing a fund to
facilitate private sector reschedulings. After foreign banks objected
strongly to the terms of the fund, Finance Minister Azpurua said that
the government will propose to Congress that the fund be abolished. In
Argentina, talks on a new stand-by arrangement with the IMF are expected
to begin later in August. IMF Board consideration of Ecuador's new
stand-by arrangement has been delayed until Ecuador takes prior actions.
A new IMF stand-by arrangement for the Philippines received tentative
approval.
Individual Country Notes. On July 22, Mexican Finance Secretary
Petricioli signed a letter of intent in support of an 18-month IMF
stand-by arrangement for SDR 1.4 billion. The program calls for a
reduction of the public sector deficit by 3 percent of GDP through
(a) improved tax collection and the elimination of some deductions,
(b) increases in public sector prices, and (c) a reduction in public
sector expenditures. It calls for a recovery of GDP growth, which is
expected to be negative in 1986, and for new initiatives in
privatization, trade liberalization, and encouraging foreign direct
investment. The program includes two contingency mechanisms for
additional financing, one in case the economic recovery fails to
materialize, the other in case oil export prices average less than $9
per barrel for a calendar quarter within the first nine months of the

IV-24
program. (External financing would be reduced should oil export prices
average more than $14 per barrel for a calendar quarter within the first
nine months of the program.) The program envisages 18-month external
financing of about $12 billion, of which the commercial banks would be
asked to provide about $6 billion in new money ($3.5 billion in 1986 and
$2.5 billion in 1987 as envisaged by the IMF staff). Formal IMF
approval of the stand-by arrangement is planned for September. A
bridging loan from the monetary authorities of a number of developed and
developing countries and commercial banks is under negotiation.
In July, the CPI rose by 5 percent, after a 6.4 percent rise in
June, to a level 86 percent above July 1985. Beginning June 9, deposit
interest rates were increased five times by a total of 7.5-12.25
percentage points. After mid-July, the sale of Treasury bills to the
highest bidder was resumed, reversing the practice, instituted last
October, of announcing in advance the rate at which the bills would be
sold and letting the market determine the volume. In line with its
commitments to the IMF, the government, in early August, raised sharply
Mexico City public transport fares and fuel prices. Since June, the
daily rate of crawl of the peso price of the dollar in the controlled
market has been accelerated. This price rose by about 10 percent in
July, compared with less than 7 percent per month in the second quarter.
Negotiations on Mexico's accession to GATT were completed in July.
Mexico is expected to sign the protocol of accession in mid-August and
to become a full member by September.
The Brazilian government announced on July 23 measures designed to
restrain domestic demand and to encourage the holding of longer-term

IV-25
securities. Surcharges (some of which were characterized as compulsory
loans) were imposed on gasoline, fuel alcohol, cars, airline tickets,
and the purchase of foreign exchange for travel. Among other measures,
certain withholding taxes will be substantially increased on short-term
securities and decreased on long-term securities.
The surcharge measures were presented in the context of financing a
new development plan that will emphasize spending on social welfare,
transport, and energy. However, it appears that the main purpose was to
raise revenues (an estimated 1.8 percent of GDP) and to adjust prices
upward for a select number of goods in short supply under the price
freeze. Longer-term CD rates are reported to have dropped by about 6
percentage points (from 32-33 percent) in response to the change in the
taxation of financial assets. The spread between the official and
market exchange rates increased by 15 percent to about 75 percent in the
week following the announcement of the measures.
Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in June, and now have risen 3.4
percent since the introduction of the February 28 anti-inflation plan.
Brazil's trade surplus was $6.2 billion in the first half of 1986
compared with $5.4 billion in the same period a year earlier.
Creditor banks are in the process of signing the $31 billion
rescheduling/rollover package for 1985-86 that Brazil and its advisory
committee agreed to on March 1. Participation by banks holding 90-95
percent of the debt, which is necessary for the package to become
effective, will hinge on Brazil compensating creditors for losses
surrounding the intervention of three Brazilian banks in late 1985. As
of August 8, between 75 and 85 percent of the banks had signed. The

IV-26
termination date of the March 1 commitment to Brazil from the advisory
committee has been extended from August 15 to September 5.
On July 29, Brazil and Argentina signed an agreement establishing a
program for economic integration and cooperation. The purpose of the
agreement is to increase bilateral trade and investment. The various
agreements are to be implemented gradually.
On July 2, Venezuela's Congress approved legislation establishing
the Exchange Compensation Fund (FOCOCAM) to coordinate rescheduling of
$3.6 billion of $6.9 billion in registered private sector external debt.
FOCOCAM would collect bolivars from private sector debtors that wished
to retain access to a preferential dollar rate for debt repayment. In
exchange, the creditors would receive 15-year, dollar-denominated bonds
paying a maximum of 5 percent interest. On July 17, the preferential
rate available for repayment under the plan was changed to 7.5
bolivars/$ from 4.3 bolivars/$. Foreign banks have objected strongly to
the changes in private debt repayment, and a special session of the
Venezuelan Congress will meet this month to review the legislation.
Finance Minister Azpurua said on August 12 that the government
will propose liquidation of FOCOCAM to the Congress, but it is unclear
what, if anything, the government will put in its place.
In Argentina, talks with the IMF on a new stand-by arrangement are
likely to begin later in August. Argentina waited to begin negotiations
until the outcome of Mexico's negotiations with the IMF was known.
Consumer prices rose 6.8 percent in July. Inflation has escalated since
the beginning of the year, and through seven months of 1986 has been 33
percent. The government in its 1986 budget assumed inflation of 28

IV-27
percent for the entire year. Publicity surrounding publication of the
July CPI increase rekindled inflationary expectations. The interbank
interest rate rose to 8.1 percent per month on August 11, up about 2.5
percentage points per month from two weeks earlier. Since the end of
July, the monthly interest rates on regulated 30-day loans and deposits
also have been raised two percentage points to 7 and 5.5 percent,
respectively. The mini-devaluations of the austral were stepped up.
However, the spread between the austral price of the dollar in the
parallel market and the official rate, which since July 1 had been
virtually eliminated, increased to 10.8 percent on August 12.
IMF Board consideration of a one-year, SDR 75 million stand-by
arrangement and SDR 40 million Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF)
for Ecuador, which had been scheduled for August 4, was postponed
because the government failed to take prior actions involving
devaluation of the exchange rate, lowering minimum denominations of
certificates of deposit, and liberalization of import licensing
agreements. The CFF for Ecuador would be the first facility for an OPEC
member based on an export shortfall that is due to low oil prices.
Ecuador has received commitments for about $180 million for a commercial
bank oil export financing facility (originally planned for $150-200
million).
Peru has recently significantly expanded its restrictions on
servicing its external debt. For the first time, the government banned
debt service payments on private sector external debt. Foreign currency
remittances associated with foreign direct investment were also limited.
In addition, existing restrictions on debt servicing of public sector

IV-28
medium- and long-term debt were extended for an indefinite period. The
only debts that Peru will continue to service are short-term trade
credits (about $100 million in such credits are currently outstanding)
and debts owed to those creditors that are still willing to provide net
new credit to Peru: i.e., the World Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank, and some Paris Club governments.
Peruvian officials announced that they plan to pay only about $35
million of the $186 million in arrears that they owe to the IMF by
August 15. The IMF Executive Board decided in May that if Peru did not
eliminate its arrears to the Fund by August 15 Peru would lose its
eligibility to use IMF resources. All of these actions by Peru were
taken in the context of a deteriorating trade balance. At the end of
March, Peru had $2 billion in gross foreign exchange reserves with an
additional 2.5 million ounces in gold reserves. Since that time Peru is
reported to have lost about $300 million in reserves.
Nigeria is preparing to inaugurate a second-tier foreign exchange
market on or before October 1. The government has indicated that
transactions for most goods and services (official debt service will
continue to be converted at the official rate) will be channeled through
the second-tier market. On August 5, in anticipation of the opening of
the second-tier market, the government announced that Nigerians could
hold and trade foreign exchange on the parallel market. The official
and second-tier rates are expected to be unified within 12 months. In
anticipation of a unified rate, the government has been adjusting the
official rate downward in small increments on an almost daily basis.
Since June, the naira has been devalued from $0.85 to $0.75.

IV-29
Although the government has consistently opposed a formal IMF
stand-by arrangement with drawings, it may be working toward an
alternative arrangement with quantitative targets and performance
criteria that it could "sell" domestically. Adoption of an IMF program
could open the way for a $400 million World Bank loan (which would be
used to supply foreign exchange to the second-tier market), and
commercial banks and Paris Club reschedulings. The banks have already
agreed to defer principal payments until October 1, but Nigeria has
asked for new money as part of a comprehensive rescheduling package.
Early this month, the Philippines and an IMF mission in Manila
reached tentative agreement on a new 18-month, SDR 189 million stand-by
arrangement and an SDR 224 million Compensatory Financing Facility
(CFF). Prior to Board approval, the government will produce a program
for reforming insolvent government financial institutions and commit
itself to a timetable for continuing the process of liberalizing
imports. If the reform plan for the government financial institutions
is approved by the World Bank and the entire program is given the green
light by the IMF Management in mid-September, the Fund Board is expected
to approve the program in October.
