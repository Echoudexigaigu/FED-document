 
Prefatory Note  
 
 
The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent economic indicators point to a moderate pickup in growth in
the current quarter. Payroll employment continued to expand in August, with
gains widespread by industry. Consumer spending has continued to increase
rapidly, and construction of single-family houses has been well maintained.
Capital outlays, however, have remained soft--especially those for new
structures. Although some price measures have been affected by recent
developments in energy and food markets, the underlying rate of inflation
appears little changed from the moderate pace observed over the past year.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production edged up an estimated 0.1 percent in August,
and revised data for the preceding two months indicate somewhat stronger
industrial activity than estimated earlier. In particular, total industrial
production for June was revised from a 0.3 percent decline to no change,
and July output from a 0.1 percent drop to a rise of 0.3 percent. In July
and August, gains in output were especially large for defense and space
equipment; in addition, production of business equipment, consumer goods,
and construction supplies posted solid advances.
As part of the staff's ongoing review of its statistical series,
the index of industrial production has been revised back to January 1984.
For 1984 and 1985, the revised data indicate slightly less growth in the
total index than previously estimated: a rise of 11.2 percent in 1984
(instead of 11.5 percent), and an increase of 2.0 percent during 1985 (instead
of 2.2 percent). In contrast, the revisions for the first seven months of
1986 indicate somewhat stronger industrial activity than previously estimated:
a cumulative decline of 1.1 percent for the period, instead of 2.1 percent.

Capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities fell
0.1 percentage point in August to 79.0 percent. This level is about the
same as the rate for the three preceding months, but 1.6 percentage points
lower than a year earlier. The overall decrease in August was related to
a further drop in utilization in the mining industry and to a weather-related
decline in electricity generation; the operating rate in manufacturing edged
up 0.1 percentage point in August.
Employment and Unemployment
Employment continued to expand in August: total nonfarm payroll
employment rose 240,000 after adjusting for strike activity, somewhat
better than the average pace so far this year. Although hiring at service-
producing establishments accounted for about two-thirds of the overall
increase, the manufacturing sector registered a strike-adjusted gain of
nearly 40,000 jobs-the first such increase since January. The largest
increases occurred in transportation equipment and chemicals, but a number
of other industries reported increases as well. In addition, manufacturers
lengthened work schedules last month, with the factory workweek rising
0.2 hours to 40.8 hours-its highest level since January. Elsewhere,
construction employment was up 55,000 in August, apparently reflecting
the strong activity in the housing sector. The number of jobs in oil and
gas extraction slipped another 10,000 last month, bringing the cumulative
job loss over the past year to more than 150,000.
The civilian unemployment rate fell to 6.8 percent in August,
nearly 1/2 percentage point below the second-quarter average. In general,
most demographic groups have experienced some decline in joblessness this

year; only the unemployment rate for adult men has not dropped, on balance,
from its level at the end of last year.
Personal Consumption and Income
Real consumption spending rose at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in
the second quarter-one of the highest growth rates reported in the current
expansion, and strength continues to be evident in the third quarter.
Real purchases in July were well above their second-quarter level, and
advance information on August retail sales suggests that real spending
rose again last month. Outlays for durable goods other than autos, which
had been strong earlier in the year, dropped back in August; however,
general merchandisers posted another solid gain.
Growth in disposable personal income, which had been quite robust
throughout much of the first half of this year, slowed in June and July,
and the personal saving rate dropped to 4.0 and 4.2 respectively in those
months-well below the first-half average of 5.1 percent.
Despite some slowing in income growth, indexes of consumer attitudes
have remained at fairly high levels. Perceptions of personal financial
situations as reported to the Michigan survey are at levels comparable to
earlier cyclical highs. Respondents believe that it continues to be a
good time to buy a house or a car. However, attitudes about near-term
economic conditions turned down somewhat in August. The rate of inflation
expected over a 12-month horizon has moved up from 3-3/4 percent earlier
this year to 4.3 percent in August.
Autos
Sales of new domestic cars rose sharply in the last 10 days of August
to a 10.6 million unit annual rate, and soared to a 17 million unit rate

in the first 10 days of September. The surge reflected an enthusiatic
response by consumer to automakers' latest round of incentive programs.1
However, the incentives are scheduled to expire early in October with the
introduction of the new model year, and some "payback" of the current
heightened pace of sales is likely to occur in the fall.
As an additional measure to liquidate excessive inventories, General
Motors scaled back production from earlier plans, mostly by lengthening
plant closings during the usual model changeover. As a result, auto
production in August fell to a 7 million unit annual rate from the 7.6
million pace in July. However, assembly schedules indicate that automakers
plan to produce cars at a relatively high 8.2 million unit rate in
September.2
Sales of foreign cars have been strong in recent months, reaching a
3.3 million unit annual rate in both July and August. Moreover, sales of
light trucks also picked up in August, and are expected to rise further
in September. Many domestic and foreign trucks are currently covered by
sales incentive programs.

Business fixed investment remained sluggish through July, with con-

rates on four-year auto loans were in the range of 11 percent during August.
2. All figures are based on FRB seasonals. Although monthly production
patterns differ when BEA's seasonals are used, the average production rates
over July and August show similar declines from their second-quarter levels on
both seasonal bases.

construction put-in-place (which excludes petroleum drilling) fell 0.6
percent in July, the fifth decline in the past six months. Compared with
the end-of-1985 peak, the July level of outlays for commercial and industrial
buildings was down about 15 percent. The drop reflects the substantial
surplus of industrial and commercial space, as well as the expected
removal of- some tax advantages for commercial structures investment. One
encouraging development, however, is that the precipitous decline in
petroleum drilling activity during the first half of this year appears to
be abating.
In contrast to the downtrend in construction outlays, spending for
equipment appears to have expanded somewhat in recent months. Nominal
shipments of nondefense capital goods by domestic producers rose 0.4
percent in July to a level 1 percent above the second-quarter average,
primarily reflecting gains in recent months for office and computing
equipment plus aircraft and parts. Some additional firming in equipment
demand is indicated by the data on new orders for nondefense capital
goods, which rebounded moderately in June and July after three months
of decline. Bookings for computers, in particular, have shown marked
improvement from their depressed levels of earlier this year.1
The most recent Commerce Department survey of planned 1986 capital
spending indicates that businesses expect nominal outlays during this
1. Since June, plans to order new aircraft from Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas have been announced by several airlines. For the most part,
however, these intended bookings have not been recorded officially on the
books of either company. Only after this official recording takes place
will these bookings be incorporated into the new orders series. As this
occurs over coming months, we expect this series to show a rising trend
of orders.

II-12
calendar year to be 1.9 percent below last year's spending level; in the
spring survey, businesses anticipated a 0.2 percent rise in capital
outlays. For the most part, the revision to 1986 plans occurred because
actual second-quarter expenditures turned out weaker than previously
expected. As in the previous survey, firms still expect spending to pick
up in the second half of the year.
The recent performance of capital spending, as well as the outlook,
has been affected by the likelihood of tax reform. For equipment, the
retroactive repeal of the investment tax credit probably has already begun
to restrain some purchases. Beginning in 1987, depreciation write-offs
for equipment generally would become less accelerated, further holding
down spending. However, the expected lengthening of depreciation schedules
may shift some spending into 1986. For nonresidential construction, the
impact of the bill also would be negative, with some variation across
sectors. Commercial construction would be especially hard-hit, owing to
the cutback in the tax-shelter benefits that frequently motivate these
projects.
Business Inventories
Investment in nonauto business inventories remained moderate through
July. For all manufacturers and nonauto trade establishments, inventories
rose in July at an annual rate of $6.7 billion in book value terms-similar
to the $4.7 billion pace seen in the first half of this year.
Manufacturers continued to maintain lean stocks through mid-summer.
The book value of factory stocks was about unchanged from May to July, and
the ratio of inventories to shipments remained low at most industries.
On balance, manufacturers' stock adjustments have been relatively small

in recent months, suggesting that factory inventories have been roughly in
line with recent market conditions. Inventories held by nonauto retailers
have been little changed recently. Indeed, the inventory position of
stores that carry largely discretionary consumption goods improved in
early summer as brisk sales helped to reduce their inventory-sales ratios.
For autos, book-value data showed a large increase in July that
appears anomalous in light of information on unit production and sales.
Dealer stocks of new domestic cars declined in July and were pared
significantly further in August, reflecting the cutbacks in assembly
schedules and the latest round of sales incentives.
Housing Markets
Despite recent declines, the level of residential construction was
fairly well-maintained through the summer. Housing starts totaled
1.8 units (annual rate) in July and August. Single-family starts turned
up in August; the level rose 3 percent to a 1.2 million unit annual
rate, close to the vigorous pace seen in the first half of the year.
Multifamily housing starts held steady in August at a pace considerably
below the level seen earlier in the year. In light of the high vacancy
rates and the prospect of unfavorable tax changes, construction
of multifamily units is likely to decline further in the near term.
Sales of new homes have dropped below the extraordinary levels
recorded earlier in the year when mortgage rates were 50 basis points or
more below the July average. Sales in July fell 5.6 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 658,000 units-off 16 percent from the
second-quarter average. In contrast sales of existing homes edged up 2

percent in July to 3.45 million units (annual rate)-in the upper part of
the range that has prevailed since late last year.
House prices continued their sharp rise in July. New home prices
rose 17.6 percent during the 12 months ending in July, while the average
sales price of existing homes increased by 9.7 percent relative to one
year earlier. Adjusted prices of new homes available for the second
quarter indicate that nearly half of that price jump is attributable to
changes in the quality or regional mix of sales.
The Federal Government
With fiscal 1986 about over, the federal deficit apparently will be
bigger than last year's record $212 billion and will remain in the range
of 5 to 5-1/2 percent of GNP. Large spending increases continued for
defense and agricultural programs, but the rise in receipts slowed to
only half the pace experienced in 1984 and 1985.
For FY1987, which begins October 1, the large number of spending
and revenue measures still before Congress have created a substantial
legislative log-jam. The tax reform conference agreement is scheduled to
be taken up in both chambers this month. Congress also is still considering
all 13 regular appropriations bills (the House has passed nearly all, but
none has gone to House-Senate conference), a budget reconciliation bill,
a long-term debt limit increase, and changes to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
(G-R-H) legislation to restore the automatic procedure for budget cuts
that was invalidated by the Supreme Court. In the past, Congress has
resorted to enactment of an omnibus continuing resolution in place of
appropriations for large parts of the government. In recent years, this
vehicle has been used to avoid disruption of federal programs until

regular appropriations were passed and to finance some part of the government
for the entire fiscal year. There has been speculation that such an
omnibus bill might be a convenient way this year to deal with G-R-H
spending and deficit limitations under tight time deadlines.
With regard to the G-R-H requirements, OMB and CBO jointly issued
the initial sequestration report for FY1987 on August 20. Based on laws
and regulations in effect August 15 (including FY1986 appropriations
since none were enacted for FY1987), the report found that the deficit
would be $163 billion--$9 billion above the sequestration trigger and
$19 billion over the $144 billion deficit target mandated by the law.
To meet the target, the backup procedures require Congress to enact
legislation immediately, with half the spending cuts in defense and the
other half in nondefense. As shown on the table, however, 60 percent of
the budget is exempt from sequestration (11 percent in defense spending
and 49 percent in nondefense spending). In addition, 14 percent of
outlays are subject to special rules that limit allowable reductions. As
a result, the defense portion of budget not exempted by the act would be
cut 5.6 percent and the nondefense portion would be subject to 7.6 percent
in across-the-board reductions. Under the law, a special joint House-Senate
committee must report a resolution specifying such cuts. That resolution,
which is in a form requiring presidential signature to become law, would
be the basis for the final sequester order. Alternatively, Congress
could meet the current G-R-H requirements through appropriations and
other budget cutbacks or revenue measures that bring the deficit under
the $154 billion FY1987 trigger level when re-estimated early in October.

II-19
Current deliberations on the reconciliation bill suggest this latter
alternative is more likely than the across-the-board sequester.
State and Local Government
Economic conditions in the state and local government sector remain
uneven across geographic regions. Exceptionally good state fiscal conditions
in New England and the mid-Atlantic region contrast sharply with eroding
budget positions in energy-related states and in those dependent on
agriculture and timber.
Indicators of growth in the sector continued to be mixed. Total real
construction spending rose again in July, but outlays for highways and
streets, which had been rising rapidly, fell to a level below their
second-quarter average. Despite a small gain last month, August employment
in the state and local sector was nearly 40,000 below the second-quarter
level.
Prices
Energy price movements have dominated inflation measures so far
this year. In July, prices of crude oil and refined products plunged at
all levels, causing the PPI to drop 0.4 percent and holding the CPI
unchanged from June. In August, energy prices as measured in the PPI
were down again, as the August 12th pricing date apparently captured only
part of the rebound in energy prices that had occurred in spot commodity
markets. Among finished energy products, heating oil prices rose substan-
tially in August, but the index for gasoline prices fell 1.5 percent.
Nonetheless, private survey data on pump prices for gasoline suggest some
increase in the August CPI.

Led by steep increases in meat prices, food prices moved up sharply
during the summer. The CPI for food advanced 0.9 percent in July, and
measures of food prices in the PPI rose in both July and August. Meat
prices were boosted by tighter pork supplies and weather-related disruptions
in the poultry industry. Since mid-August, however, upward pressures on
meat prices have eased somewhat at the farm level. Crop prices generally
have remained weak, reflecting this year's sharp downward adjustments in
price support levels and, for some crops, a further buildup of stocks.
For commodities other than food and energy, the CPI rose 0.2
percent in July after showing little net change over the first half of
the year. The cost of nonenergy services was up 0.4 percent-somewhat
below the average pace in the first half. At the producer level, prices
of capital equipment and of consumer goods less food and energy continued
to rise more slowly than during 1985; both were up only 0.1 percent in
August after increases of 0.2 and 0.3 percent, respectively, in July. At
earlier stages of processing, prices of intermediate materials less food
and energy were flat, on average, in August; the index for crude nonfood
materials less energy dropped more than 5 percent, in large part reflecting
a plunge in cotton prices associated with the ending of price supports.
Spot prices for precious metals rose markedly during August. In
addition to concerns about supply disruptions in South Africa-the major
world producer of platinum and gold-market reports have attributed the
recent increases to renewed inflationary expectations associated with oil
price developments, the lower exchange value of the dollar, and a strong
industrial demand for platinum. Spot prices of lumber also have picked up

II-22
notably since early August and were 40 percent above their year-earlier
level in mid-September.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage rates have continued to rise slowly in recent months. The hourly
earnings index, which covers wages of production and nonsupervisory workers,
rose 0.2 percent in August after a small decline in July. During the past
eight months, this measure of wage change has risen less than 2 percent at
an annual rate, after increasing 3 percent in 1985. In addition, compensa-
tion trends have shown no signs of acceleration: hourly compensation in
the nonfarm business sector rose about 2-1/2 percent over the first half
of this year, after a 3.9 percent increase in 1985.
Productivity growth has been modest over the past year. The second
quarter estimate of output per hour, revised down sharply from the prelimi-
nary estimate, stands only 0.6 percent above its year-earlier level. Unit
labor costs were up 2-1/2 percent between 1985-Q2 and 1986-Q2, after rising
4 percent during the previous four-quarter period.

APPENDIX*
THE CONFERENCE AGREEMENT ON THE TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was agreed to by House and Senate conferees
on August 16 and is widely expected to be enacted in this form. The House
is expected to begin debate on the bill around September 19; the Senate has
not scheduled action yet, but consideration in the Senate is expected
before the end of September. Definitive information about the bill is
not available yet; the conference report, which will contain the legisla-
tive language, official explanations and revenue estimates, is just being
completed by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) staff and is not
expected to be publicly available before September 22. This appendix is
based on a JCT summary of the conference agreement and prelimiminary JCT
revenue estimates.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will restructure the federal individual
and corporate income tax code by dramatically cutting marginal tax rates
and eliminating many tax preferences. These changes constitute a fairly
pure "reform"; the act is designed neither to cut nor to increase tax
receipts in the aggregate over the five year horizon of the official revenue
estimates. There will, however, be significant shifts in tax burdens for
sectors, industries, firms, and individuals. This appendix describes the
general characteristics of this tax bill--changes in the tax rate structure
and broadening of the tax base, and preliminary revenue estimates. A more
detailed comparison of the provisions of the proposed tax code with
current law, along with effective dates of major provisions, is included
as table 2.
Changes in the individual and corporate income tax rate structure
A key element of the proposal is a dramatic lowering of marginal
tax rates. The top legislated rate for individuals will be cut from 50
percent to 28 percent when the new rates are fully effective in 1988, and
tax brackets will be substantially broadened and reduced in number from
14 to two (plus some surtax "brackets" that phase out the benefits of
several provisions available to lower income taxpayers). As indicated in
table 1, many upper income individuals will face a 33 percent marginal
tax rate because the tax benefits of the 15 percent bracket and personal
exemptions are phased out at higher income levels, adding five percentage
points to the 28 percent top rate beginning with taxable incomes of $71,900.
And the phase-out at higher income levels of the benefits of certain real
estate tax-shelter write-offs (not shown in table 1) could raise marginal
tax rates for some taxpayers to 49.5 percent. A transitional rate schedule
for 1987, also shown in table 1, represents around two-thirds of the rate
cut for 1988.
Higher tax rates will apply to other selected income items. The
top rate for realized capital gains income will increase from 20 percent

Division of Research and Statistics.

II-A-2
to 28 percent (or possibly 33 percent and higher if one or more of the
various phase-outs are in effect) owing to the repeal of the capital
gains exclusion. Many individuals will face even larger increases in
capital gains rates because they currently pay less than the top rate but
will pay the top rate under the new law. The expansion of the alternative
minimum tax to include more preferences and the increase in the tax rate
from 20 percent to 21 percent also will raise marginal tax rates on some
sources of income.
Corporations, too, will face sharply lower nominal tax rates, with
a reduction of the top rate from 46 percent in 1986 to a 40 percent
transitional top rate in 1987 and a new 34 percent top rate in 1988. The
effect of the corporate rate cuts on capital spending decisions, however,
will be modified by changes in capital cost recovery allowances. Specifi-
cally, the investment tax credit (ITC) is repealed and the rate at which
investment can be written off against taxable income is slowed for many
items. Indeed, effective tax rates1 on new investment will rise for
producers' durable equipment and rental housing. Effective tax rates for
industrial structures will be little changed because lower nominal tax
rates will about offset the slower depreciation write-offs; but will rise
for many commercial structures because new restrictions on tax-sheltered
partnerships will increase financing costs.
Base broadening provisions
Base broadening provisions, in addition to making up the revenue loss
from the rate reductions, are intended both to improve the efficiency of
the tax system by reducing its intrusion into economic choices and to
enhance its equity. The individual tax base is broadened by including in
taxable income a number of items that are now excluded from the tax base
by law, and by limiting itemized deductions. Major exclusions are repealed
or limited; affected provisions of current law include the two-earner
deduction (marriage penalty relief), deductions for IRA contributions for
many taxpayers (deferral of tax on IRA income remains), deferred compensation
plans, unemployment compensation payments, the $100 dividend exclusion,
and losses from passive tax shelters (of particular relevance for commer-
cial and multi-family residential structures). The revenue loss from
exclusion of tax-exempt bond interest income is reduced by the imposition
of tighter restrictions on the issuance of tax-exempt private-purpose
state and local bonds. Also repealed or scaled back are itemized deduc-
tions for state and local sales taxes, consumer interest, miscellaneous
deductions, and most medical expenses.
Major new sources of corporate income tax revenues include the

broadeners that affect business tend to be industry specific. For example,
completed contract accounting provisions will increase the tax payments
of firms such as defense contractors that produce products under long-term
contracts; financial institutions face new restrictions on deductions of
interest to carry tax-exempt securities and on loan loss reserve deductions;
various special deductions specific to the insurance industry are repealed
rehabilitation credits for old buildings are reduced; and new restrictions
are placed on private-purpose tax-exempt bond issuance.
The tax reform also raises some revenues from sources that are not
strictly rate or base changes--stricter IRS enforcement and an acceleration
of estimated tax payments, for example.
Revenue estimates
As shown below, tax reform will, if not offset by other fiscal
actions, contribute to deficit reduction and be a restraining economic
influence in 1987, will add to the unified deficit in 1988 and 1989, and
will again become a restraining influence in 1990 and 1991. In the
context of deficit reduction, tax reform will ease the job of hitting the
Gramm-Rudman targets in 1987, but will significantly complicate the task
in the following two years.

2. Most individuals would not pay higher taxes under the proposed rate
schedules because increases in the standard deduction and personal exemp-
tion will reduce taxable income under the proposed law relative to what
it would be under present law.
3. The phase-out of the 15 percent bracket for joint filers occurs over
the $71,900 to $149,250 taxable income range. Personal exemptions are
phased out beginning at $149,250 at the rate of $10,920 per exemption in
1988.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Money market yields generally declined after the announcement on
August 20 of another half-point cut in the discount rate. Although the
size of the drop in short-term rates suggests that the System's action was
not fully anticipated by the market, the easing step provided little if any
boost to longer-term securities prices. Indeed, bond yields have increased
noticeably in recent weeks, as traders have evidenced concerns about potential
inflationary pressures, reportedly mirrored as well in commodity markets,
and have viewed incoming data on economic activity here and abroad as
suggesting a reduced likelihood of further easing actions by monetary
authorities. The weakness in the bond markets has in turn contributed to a
substantial decline in equity prices, in very volatile trading. Meanwhile,
administered rates-notably the prime rate and primary mortgage rates-have
declined on net, in response to earlier movements in market yields.
Growth in M2 and M3 was somewhat less rapid in August, but both
measures remained around the upper bounds of their target ranges. Runoffs
in small time deposits became more pronounced as investors moved to more
liquid deposits on which offering rates have been comparatively sticky.
M1 continued to expand extremely rapidly; all components grew briskly, but
increases in NOW accounts were especially large.
The aggregrate debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have
accelerated thus far in the third quarter. Net borrowing by nonfinancial
firms probably picked up somewhat in August: bank loans and commercial paper
strengthened; bond issuance remained substantial in August though slackening
a bit in September; and mergers and other restructurings continued to ex-
tinguish large amounts of outstanding equity shares. Municipal bond offerings

were exceptionally heavy in July and August, but the volume has dropped off
sharply since then in light of proposed tax reform restrictions. Federal
borrowing has remained strong in the third quarter. Overall, household
debt growth shows little sign of abating and may have strengthened some
this quarter; available evidence suggests net mortgage lending is continuing
at a brisk pace, and incentive programs for automobile loans likely will
boost consumer installment debt appreciably in September.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 accelerated to a 20 percent annual rate of increase in August,
which pushed it further beyond its 1986 target range. Demand deposits and
currency rose at double-digit rates, but the expansion was paced by continued
strong inflows to other checkable deposits (OCDs). Yield spreads between
OCDs and less liquid alternatives were already relatively small, and
additional narrowing to the 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point range helped propel
OCD growth to almost a 40 percent annual rate.1

Between January of this year (when NOW rates were deregulated) and August,
the average rate paid by commercial banks on NOW accounts fell only 1/2

several large banks in California, New York City, and Chicago, NOW account
rates equal or exceed the rates offered on MMDAs. At banks with this
pricing strategy, NOW balances have grown faster than the national average.

percentage point while short-term market interest rates dropped roughly 2
percentage points. The proportion of banks paying rates below the discon-
tinued 5-1/4 percent ceiling had risen substantially as of August, but it
still was only 19 percent.
A deceleration in its nontransactions component produced a slight
reduction in the overall growth of M2 to an annual rate of 10-1/2 percent
in August. Growth of overnight RPs, Eurodollars, and money market mutual
funds slowed, and runoffs of small time deposits picked up. Expansion of
MMDAs and savings deposits remained strong, however, reflecting preferences
for relatively liquid monetary assets within M2 as a whole. Like NOW
accounts, these more liquid deposits have been available at only a small
sacrifice in yield relative to small time deposits. For example, at
commercial banks in August, the spread between average offering rates on
MMDAs and on 6-month small time deposits was less than 1/4 percentage
point. In the case of passbook accounts, the tendency for spreads to
narrow has been reinforced by a reluctance to cut rates below former
ceilings for fear of sensitizing long-time depositors to the availability
of competitive instruments.1
M3 growth moderated in August to an 8-1/4 percent annual rate.
Large CDs decelerated at thrifts, but they advanced somewhat at banks after
several months of declines. M3 money funds recorded strong growth; these
funds, which are held by institutions that tend to be quite sensitive to
1. Experience suggests that savings rates may not be lowered quickly even
if they exceed market rates. Rates on Treasury bills fell as much as 60
basis points below the then 5-percent passbook ceiling for eight consecutive
months from 1976 into 1977, but very few banks lowered their offering rates
below 5 percent.

relative rate movements, typically expand during a decline in market rates
because their yields lag the fall in other rates.
The surge in bank credit that began in July continued in August,
paced again by expanded securities holdings. During the month, banks
acquired sizable amounts of both government and municipal securities.
They continued to add munis to their portfolios even after August 7, for
while they are slated to lose their existing tax deduction for the cost of
carrying tax-exempt securities bought after that date, this provision of
the tax reform bill will not become effective until next year. Bank loans
to businesses, which had been flat in July, rose a little in August. Real
estate loans continued to rise rapidly, and consumer loan growth remained
restrained.
Business Finance
In addition to borrowing at banks, nonfinancial firms in August
raised $4 billion through the issuance of commercial paper, reversing much
of the decline in outstandings earlier this year. Only a minor portion of
this paper was associated with merger programs, and increases in outstanding
paper appeared to be widespread among issuers. Dealers could not pinpoint
any general influences to account for the sudden jump in paper issuance.
Gross long-term debt offerings also picked up in August from July,
but volume was still below the record second-quarter pace. Although rates
subsequently backed up, declines in yields during August to the lowest
levels since early spring induced a resurgence in refunding issues,
especially by utilities. The increase in high-grade utility volume helped
offset a decrease in low-grade debt offerings by industrial firms. After
LTV declared bankruptcy in July, the market for other low-rated bonds

deteriorated, and spreads between yields of low-grade and investment-grade
bonds widened on average 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point.
The underlying financing gap of nonfinancial corporations appears to
be narrowing in the third quarter because of weak investment spending,
although cash flow, which had been rising sharply through last year's third
quarter, has since fluctuated around lower levels. The primary spur to
business borrowing continues to be the large volume of equity retirements
from mergers and share repurchases. These equity retirements likely will
be larger in the second half of this year than in the first, perhaps boosted
by tax reform provisions that make some aspects of mergers more advantageous
this year than next.1
Most stock indexes hit new highs during the intermeeting period before
plunging about 9 percent in last week's sell-off. Issues of potential
takeover targets did well during the upswing, as did those of petroleum
firms. Share prices of Texas banks also rose, benefitting from firmer oil
prices and from legislation facilitating takeovers by out-of-state banks.
The subsequent price declines were widespread, encompassing blue chips as
well as smaller capitalization issues.
Initial public offerings (IPOs) of shares were very large in August,
and dollar volume for the year should surpass the 1983 record. More than
one-fourth of last month's IPO volume came from thrift institutions
converting from mutual to stock ownership. New regulations by the Federal
1. Higher tax rates on capital gains beginning in 1987 may spur firms that
are considering share repurchases or sale of the business to complete the
transaction this year. In addition, proposed tax legislation would repeal
the General Utilities rule. Under this principle, the assets of an acquired
company can be revalued to reflect their purchase price, and the acquiring
corporation does not have to recognize the gain for tax purposes when
subsequent distributions are made.

Home Loan Bank Board have eased the stock conversion process; these
conversions and the resulting stock issuance may have been spurred by
tougher capital standards recently approved by the FHLBB.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The combined deficit of the federal government is estimated by the
Board staff at $57 billion in the third quarter, bringing the deficit for
fiscal year 1986 to $224 billion. The $32 billion increase in the debt
ceiling passed in mid-August will provide room for normal financings through
the balance of the quarter, but in early October the Treasury likely will
exhaust this expanded debt authority along with the small amount of remaining
borrowing authority of the Federal Financing Bank.1 Without congressional
action, the Treasury once again will have to alter its normal financing
pattern or delay the issuance of nonmarketable securities to the government
trust funds. Indeed, the Treasury has already postponed the auction of
7-year notes that would be expected to settle early in October.
Issuance of nonmarketable debt has been much heavier in this fiscal
year than previously. With sizable refunding activity by state and
local governments, the net increase in special nonmarketable securities
(SLGS) is estimated to be about $40 billion in fiscal 1986, more than
double the $20 billion in the previous fiscal year. Demand for SLGS is
likely to be very small in fiscal 1987 as a result of new restrictions on
tax-exempt bond issuance incorporated in proposed tax legislation. Issuance
of savings bonds has been more than double the average pace of the past
three fiscal years, although these instruments still provide only a small

securities it had previously issued to the government trust funds. The
limit on such debt issuance by the FFB is $15 billion.

III-12
fraction of the Treasury's financing needs. With a minimum rate of 7-1/2
percent on bonds held at least five years, savings bonds have become
attractive relative to deposit accounts and market instruments. In fact,
the potential costliness of these obligations has led the Treasury to
consider lowering or eliminating the minimum rate and to take little action
to overcome spot shortages of the bonds.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies continues to be
dominated by the Federal Home Loan Banks, which are estimated to have
raised $6 billion this quarter. Demand for advances from FHLBs by thrift
institutions has been strong as these institutions have substituted advances
for other managed liabilities. Fannie Mae is purchasing a large amount of
mortgages in the secondary market, but its financing needs have been small
as a result of both prepayments and its liquidation of some old, lower-rate
mortgages from its portfolio. The Farm Credit Banks continue to pay down
debt, given the weak demand for new loans by the farm sector.
Interest rate spreads between outstanding sponsored agency securities
and Treasury securities recently have narrowed somewhat. Earlier this
summer, in response to heavy volume, spreads on longer-term issues of the
FHLBs and Fannie Mae widened to about 75 basis points from the 30 basis
point level typical in the first half of the year. As these seasoned
securities have been absorbed by investors, spreads have narrowed to a
range of 50 to 65 basis points, but a new 10-year issue of the FHLBs again
had a spread of more than 70 points. Recent issues of the Farm Credit
Banks have fared well. The latest 6-month security of the FCBs carried an
interest rate spread of about 15 basis points, compared with spreads of 20
to 25 points in previous months. In general, legislation affecting the

III-13
operations of the FCBs and FSLIC appears to be reassuring investors in
the debt issues of sponsored agencies despite widespread awareness of
credit problems in the agricultural sector and at some thrift institutions.
State and Local Securities Markets
After three months over which offerings of tax-exempt securities
averaged more than $20 billion, volume has dropped sharply thus far in
September in response to restrictions contained in proposed tax legislation.
It appears that volume in September will be less than $5 billion. Earlier,
issuers rushed to market to beat a variety of restrictions that would
narrow the definition of public-purpose bonds, effective September 1.
Other provisions of the tax reform bill would reduce existing volume caps
on private-purpose bonds and further limit arbitrage and advance refunding
opportunities on all tax-exempt offerings in future years, likely depressing
supply. Provisions affecting demand are expected to have both negative and
positive effects: incentives for commercial banks to hold tax-exempt securities
would be reduced by elimination of the deductibility of interest expense
incurred in carrying such investments,1 and lower marginal tax rates should
lessen the attractiveness of tax-exempt securities relative to taxables;
but these factors may be offset by the elimination of many alternative tax
shelters. On balance, most analysts expect demand to be strong relative to
a diminished supply of tax-exempt debt, providing room for a reduction in
ratios of tax-exempt to taxable yields from the high levels seen this
summer.
1. Under the conference bill, banks will retain the 80 percent deduction for
bonds issued by certain small governmental units and not-for-profit entities,
in aggregate amounts of $10 million or less per year.

The ratio of long-term tax-exempt to taxable yields rose steadily over
the first half of the year as a burgeoning supply of municipal offerings
encountered investors reluctant to purchase tax-exempt securities owing
to tax-reform uncertainties. Subsequently, more investors were drawn into
the market as rates on some tax-exempt issues rose above those on Treasury
bonds and as some investors developed expectations for capital gains
after September 1 when supplies would contract. The ratios of the 30-year
revenue bond index to comparable yields on Treasuries and corporate
securities have fallen steadily since early July. The ratio of yields on
short-term (6-month) tax-exempt notes relative to Treasury bill rates
rose in August to 0.8, well above its average of 0.6 over the past year or
so. The ratio is expected to fall back somewhat, and it showed signs of
doing so in early September. However, it appears that some permanent
upward adjustment of the ratio at the short end would be inevitable under
tax reform, reflecting the reduced advantage of tax exemption with lower
marginal tax rates.

III-16
Among investors, property and casualty insurance companies have again
become active participants in municipal markets because of their renewed
need to shelter profits. These firms returned to profitability during the
first half of this year, largely the result of sizable increases in premium
rates.1
Proposed volume and arbitrage restrictions contained in tax legisla-
tion have encouraged the issuance of a notable volume of taxable municipal
securities. Taxable offerings by state and local governments, which were
rarely seen before this year, totaled an estimated $2.5 billion in the
first 8-1/2 months of 1986. Volume in September to date is $430 million,
about the same as in all of August. The proceeds of most of this year's
issues have been intended for private purposes, predominantly housing.
Mortgage Markets
During the intermeeting period, the cost of construction and land
development loans at commercial banks generally fell in tandem with the 50
basis point cut in the prime rate, while interest rates on permanent
mortgage financing retreated by smaller amounts. By early September, the
contract interest rate on new commitments for fixed-rate home loans at S&Ls
had fallen 33 basis points to 9.9 percent, near the recent low of April,
before backing up a little in response to a pickup in secondary market yields.
Commitment rates on adjustable-rate mortgages at S&Ls also have eased, but
the share of loans closed with adjustable-rate features reportedly has
remained small. At current rate levels, an initial rate advantage of ARMs

relative to fixed-rate borrowing of well under 2 percentage points has not
been sufficient to overcome the desire of mortgagors for stable payments.
Residential lending continued at a brisk pace throughout the summer.
Large mortgage companies reported a continued, strong volume of applications
during July and August, despite some slippage in refinancing requests.
Mortgage originations at FSLIC-insured thrifts surged to an all-time high
of $23.7 billion, seasonally adjusted, during July. Nevertheless, a high
level of loan sales and a record pace of loan retirements held their net
acquisition of mortgage loans to $1 billion. Total holdings of loans plus
mortgage-backed securities at these institutions grew only $2.2 billion,
the smallest monthly increase in more than a year.
A large volume of home mortgages has continued to be sold into the
secondary market and packaged into pass-through securities. Gross issuance
of mortgage pass-through securities that carry a GNMA, FHLMC, or FNMA credit
enhancement totaled $22.6 billion during August, an amount exceeded only by
the record volumes of June and July. The exceptional pace of pass-through
issuance reflects the surge in fixed-rate lending during the spring and
early summer as well as the packaging of seasoned mortgage loans into
securities. Most notably, FNMA volume was boosted by $5.5 billion during
the past five months from the sale of pass-throughs backed by seasoned
FHA/VA loans that had been held in the corporation's portfolio. These
sales are part of Fannie Mae's plan to restructure its balance sheet by
selling $10 billion of low-yielding mortgages acquired before 1981.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit grew at about an 11-1/2 percent annual
rate in July, the same pace as in June. Automobile credit, which accounted

for a disproportionate two-thirds of the June and July increases, rose at a
20 percent annual rate during those two months, largely the result of
incentive financing programs by the auto manufacturers--programs considerably
less attractive than those now in place. Growth in other forms of installment
credit meanwhile has been moderate.
Various measures of debt payment problems indicate increased diffi-
culties for consumers. Delinquency rates on both installment and mortgage
debt rose in the second quarter (see table on page III-20). At commercial
banks, the ratio of delinquent closed-end consumer installment loans rose
to its highest level since late 1980 but still remained below the 1974-75
peaks. Credit card delinquencies soared to a record 3.23 percent. The
rapid run-up in credit card delinquencies likely reflects past campaigns by
many banks to increase their cardholder base and individual credit limits.
Many bankers anticipated that they would experience substantial delinquencies
from unseasoned credit card accounts, and they feel that the associated
charge-offs are manageable given the ample rate margins. The System's
survey of bank lending officials continues to show a broad enthusiasm
for consumer lending.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dollar is about
unchanged on balance since the last FOMC meeting, as shown in the upper
panel of the chart. During the first two weeks of the intermeeting
period the dollar generally was supported by expectations that Germany
and perhaps Japan would lower interest rates, but declined sharply
following the release of data showing a larger-than-expected U.S.-trade
deficit in July. The dollar rebounded in response to additional U.S.
economic data suggesting improved prospects for U.S. growth. Toward the
end of the intermeeting period the dollar resumed its decline as the
view emerged in the market that foreign authorities -- particularly in
Germany -- would tolerate further dollar depreciation if the recent
strength in domestic demand abroad proved insufficient to produce
adjustment in the external accounts. This shift in opinion was
prompted by
statements by German monetary authorities maintaining no need to add
stimulus in the face of robust German economic activity. On a bilateral
basis, the dollar's value rose about 1-1/2 percent against the yen and
sterling but has depreciated 1-1/4 percent against the mark during the
intermeeting period.
With foreign monetary authorities showing little inclination to
follow the U.S. reduction in the discount rate, short-term interest
rates abroad were about unchanged during the intermeeting period, while
comparable U.S. interest rates declined about 20 basis points.
Meanwhile, as the yield curve in the United States steepened, U.S.

long-term nominal interest rates moved up sharply relative to comparable
foreign interest rates.
In other currency developments, the value of the Argentine austral
in parallel exchange markets has fallen about 30 percent against the
dollar since August 1. A significant deterioration in Argentina's
inflation performance kindled selling pressure on the austral. The
Argentine monetary authorities responded by stepping-up the pace of
devaluations in the official exchange rate; since August 1, the
controlled value of the austral has declined 9 percent including a 3
percent devaluation as part of a package of reforms introduced on
August 29.
.The Canadian dollar's value firmed slightly in terms of the
dollar, having received some support from repeated declarations by U.S.
officials that an appreciation of the Canadian dollar was appropriate to
resolve trade imbalances.
; episodes of selling
pressure on the Australian dollar were prompted by skepticism regarding

IV-4
the economic assumptions in the budget and a downgrading of Australian
debt issues by Moody's investment service.
Dollar prices of precious metals continued to move up sharply
during the intermeeting period. As shown in the lower panel of the
chart, since August 1, gold prices have risen 16 percent to a level of
nearly $420 an ounce -- while the price of silver has climbed 13 percent.
Meanwhile, platinum prices surged to a peak of $680 an ounce before
retreating to a level of $570 -- registering an overall gain of 27
percent. Economic and political developments potentially affecting
supply from South Africa and -- to some extent -- concern over prospects
for inflation reportedly motivated the run-up in metals' prices.

IV-5
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets in the United States increased again in July,
.The
increase in holdings was largely in the form of Treasury bills.
Preliminary information available from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York indicates that official reserve accumulation by the G-10 countries
and Switzerland continued strong in August. The data on official holdings
in the United States for September are likely to reflect the proceeds of
the $4 billion floating rate note issued by the United Kingdom in the
Euromarket; the proceeds of the $2.5 billion floating rate note issued by
the United Kingdom in 1985 were added to reserves in the United States.
Foreigners other than official reserve holders sold U.S. Treasury
securities net in July. This result was more than accounted for by the
World Bank; other private foreigners added almost $1.4 billion to their
holdings. However, reported Japanese net purchases continued to be small,
only $300 million in July, bringing total Japanese net purchases to $233
million for the first seven months of 1986.
Private capital inflows through other securities transactions
continued to be large in July. Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate
bonds were almost $4 billion on a payments basis, and net purchases of
corporate stocks were $1.8 billion. Japanese net purchases of both were
unusually large for a single month: over $1 billion in bonds and $600
million in stocks. The data on Japanese purchases of U.S. corporate bonds
are undoubtedly understated since purchases of Eurobonds through
underwriters in Europe would be reported as sales to the country of the
underwriter. Market commentary has indicated that Japanese institutional

investors have been diversifying in response to the relatively low rate of
return paid on U.S. Treasury securities.
Issuance of Eurobonds by U.S. corporations remained strong in August,
although below peak rates reached in the spring. Floating rate notes
enjoyed renewed popularity in July and August, with a substantial volume
issued by U.S. Savings and Loan Associations and collateralized by
GNMA-guaranteed mortgages.
Overall, banks reported a net inflow in July, despite substantial
net outflows to affiliated banks outside the United States. As much as
$9 billion of the increase in bank liabilities to foreigners in July and
$5 billion in June are probably attributable to a change in the Treasury
International Capital (TIC) reporting system which clarifies reporting
responsibility, and not to capital inflows that occurred during those
months. As of July, banks that book loans to U.S. corporations at their
offshore offices must either send a written report to their corporate
customers and the FRBNY (which acts as agent for the Treasury in
collecting TIC data), notifying the corporations that they have reportable
liabilities to foreigners, or the banks must themselves report liabilities
of U.S. residents held in custody for banks outside the United States. It
is these custody liabilities to banks in the Bahamas and British West
Indies that have increased, mostly on the books of U.S.-based banks.
Since Federal Reserve reports of credit extended to U.S. nonbank residents
by foreign branches of U.S.-based banks show no increase during these
months, it appears that the banks are now reporting loans that were made
earlier and that previously were reflected in the positive statistical
discrepancy in the accounts.

Recently released data on U.S. international transactions for the
second quarter indicate that the statistical discrepancy in the accounts
continues to be large and positive. (See line 10 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table.) In addition, foreign direct investment
in the United States (line 7) amounted to almost $4 billion in the second
quarter, while U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6) fell to about $5

U.S. Merchandise Trade
Commerce Department figures on U.S. merchandise trade through
July show (in column 8 of the table below) that the deficit in July was
substantially larger than in previous months as imports rose sharply. The
staff believes that much of the surge in imports will prove to be
temporary. The rise in imports in July was spread among all major trade
categories.

The value of total exports in the second quarter was up 2 percent
from first-quarter levels. However, a substantial increase in exports of
gold masked declines in agricultural exports and many categories of
nonagricultural trade particularly petroleum products, construction
machinery, automotive parts to Canada, and chemicals. Part of the recent
decline in agricultural exports may have resulted from an anticipation of
price declines that would occur when U.S. support price levels for corn,
wheat and cotton were reduced (on September 1, June 1, and August 1
respectively). Excluding gold exports, the volume of nonagricultural
exports declined by 1/2 percent in the second quarter. Gold exports,
nearly $13 billion at an annual rate in the second quarter, were largely
to Japan to be used in the minting of a commemorative gold coin. The gold
was imported into the United States over the past six months.
Nonagricultural exports to Western Europe, Canada, Mexico and the newly
industrialized countries in the Far East were little changed from
first-quarter levels.
On the import side, the value of total imports rose less than 1
percent in the second quarter. However, a sharp decline in oil imports
was offset by an increase in imports of other items. The decline in the
value of oil imports resulted from a nearly 40 percent drop in the price
of oil that was partly offset by a nearly 30 percent increase in the
volume of oil imported (from a low first-quarter average) as inventories
were rebuilt. (See the table below.) Uncertainties regarding world oil
prices continue to result in wide swings in imports from quarter to
quarter.

Nonoil imports increased by 3-1/2 percent in value in the second
quarter. About half of the increase resulted from rising import prices.
On a fixed-weight basis, the price of nonoil imports increased at a 6-1/2
percent rate in the second quarter, the third quarter in a row of such
increases. This rise in the index for all nonoil imports occurred in
spite of continuing declines being recorded for prices of industrial
supplies (which account for 20 percent of nonoil imports). The strongest
price rises were recorded for various manufactured goods, particularly
general industrial machinery (other than computers), electric machinery
and telecommunication equipment, photographic equipment and passenger cars.
For the volume of nonoil imports, the 2 percent increase in the second
quarter was spread among various trade categories (machinery, aircraft,
passenger cars, consumer goods and gold) and came from various geographic
areas (Japan, Western Europe, Latin America, and the newly industrialized
countries in the Far East).

U.S. Current Account
In the second quarter, the U.S. current account was $138.9
billion at an annual rate, marginally larger than the deficit in the first
quarter (revised). Smaller net deficits in merchandise trade, military
transactions and other services were more than offset by increased net
portfolio (interest) payments to foreigners, increased unilateral
transfers (largely U.S. government grants to developing countries), and a
reduction in income from U.S. direct investments abroad (mainly from
reduced earnings of petroleum affilites).

Foreign Economic Developments. Recent data for the foreign industrial
economies provide evidence of a pick-up of real growth in the second
quarter of 1986 after weak or negative real growth in the first quarter.
Real GNP in Japan grew 3.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter
after a moderate decline in the first quarter. In Germany, real GNP
grew by 14.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter following a
revised 4.3 percent fall in the first quarter. Second-quarter real GDP
growth was also higher than first quarter growth in France and Canada.
In July, industrial production fell in Japan while it rose in Germany
and the United Kingdom.
Inflation abroad continues to be very low. In August, the German
cost of living index stood below its year-earlier level while consumer
prices in Japan were close to year-ago levels. Inflation in France,
Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom has remained moderate in recent
months, although there is some evidence that the deceleration of prices
is slowing.
External surpluses in Japan and Germany have remained at record
rates while France and Italy have experienced substantial declines in
their trade deficits. In recent months, trade balances in the United
Kingdom and Canada have deteriorated. In the United Kingdom, increased
trade deficits have been largely a result of the lower value of U.K. oil
exports.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, recent data indicate that real
GNP grew 3.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter after declining
2.1 percent in the first quarter. The increase in growth reflected
stronger personal consumption, a positive contribution of the government

sector, and growth in exports. Domestic demand grew by 8.2 percent
(s.a.a.r.), while net exports made a negative contribution to growth.
However, government purchases of gold to produce coins commemorating the
60th anniversary of Emperor Hirohito's reign were added to government
inventories and subtracted as imports, and thus, affected the
distribution of growth between domestic demand and net exports without
affecting the overall growth rate. Excluding these extraordinary gold
imports, domestic demand grew by 3.4 percent (s.a.a.r.), and net exports
made a small positive contribution to growth that was attributable to
strong automobile exports.
Preliminary indications on the pace of economic activity in the
third quarter do not suggest continued strength in growth. Industrial
production fell 0.2 percent (s.a.) in July and the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) has projected an even steeper
decline in August with a rebound in September. Retail sales have been
erratic in recent months, rising 0.8 percent (s.a.) in June but falling
0.6 percent in July. The unemployment rate rose to 2.9 percent in July
from 2.7 percent in June. Two signs of strength in the third quarter
are the July increase in new housing starts by 5.5 percent (s.a.) and a
9 percent year-over-year rise in new construction orders in July.
Japanese consumer prices have remained stable in recent months.
The Tokyo consumer price index rose a modest 0.4 percent in the three
months ending in August relative to the comparable period last year.
Wholesale prices have continued to decline, and the overall wholesale
price index stood 11.2 percent below its year-earlier level in August.
This sharp fall in wholesale prices has been primarily due to the

IV-19
decline in oil prices and the impact of the yen's appreciation on
imported goods prices.
Japan's external surplus continues at a record rate. Through
August, the cumulative trade surplus was $77.5 billion (s.a.a.r.). The
cumulative current account surplus through July was $76.1 billion
(s.a.a.r.) compared with $44 billion through July of 1985. Adjustment
in trade volumes has continued. In August, export volume was 3.7
percent below and import volume was 12.6 percent above year-earlier
levels.
Money growth accelerated in August, with M2 + CDs growing a
preliminary 8.9 percent relative to last August, after growing 8.4
percent in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 1985.
The Bank of Japan attributes the rise in money growth to an increase in
large-denomination time deposits stemming from recently liberalized
interest rates.
Prime Minister Nakasone will announce an economic stimulus package
around September 19 that is expected to include a supplementary budget
of at least 3 trillion yen (about $19 billion), largely for public works
projects, measures to stimulate housing investment, further assistance
to small business hurt by the yen's appreciation, and perhaps a
reference to more flexible monetary policy. Prime Minister Nakasone's
term has been extended for one year beyond its October 30, 1986,
expiration date.
Real GNP in Germany grew at an annual rate of 14.3 percent in the
second quarter to a level 3.8 percent above the second quarter of last
year. Domestic demand increased by 18.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the

IV-20
second quarter with private consumption and construction as the leading
components. The external sector's contribution to second-quarter growth
was negative. Very strong import growth more than offset above average
export growth. Among more recent indicators, industrial production grew
1.4 percent in July, and the June result was revised substantially
upward. New orders in July also showed strength, especially in domestic
sectors. Employment is gradually increasing, and the unemployment rate
was below 9 percent (s.a.) in July and August for the first time in
2-1/2 years. Survey returns on the business climate, investment
intentions and consumer confidence suggest support for modest growth in
economic activity.
The cost of living index has continued to decline this year to a
level in August that was 0.4 percent below August of last year.
Wholesale, producer, and especially import prices, are substantially
below their year-ago levels.
The German current account continues to benefit from large terms of
trade gains. Through July, the cumulative current account surplus was
$17.8 billion, compared with a $5.7 billion surplus for the same period
of last year. Similarly, this year's trade surplus through July of $27
billion was larger than the $12.5 billion surplus in the same period
last year. The increased external surplus is entirely due to price
movements. If measured in constant DM prices, the trade surplus so far
this year is below its comparable level of last year.
German Central Bank Money grew 10 percent (s.a.a.r.) in August.
The growth rate between the fourth quarter of last year and August was

IV-21
7.1 percent (s.a.a.r.), well above the Bundesbank's target of 3.5 to 5.5
percent growth between the fourth quarters of 1985 and 1986.
In France, industrial production increased by 2.3 percent (s.a.) in
June and was 1.5 percent above its year-earlier level. The unemployment
rate (s.a.) increased slightly to a record 10.7 percent in August.
Real GDP grew 4.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, driven by an
increase in domestic demand of 12.2 percent. The increase in domestic
demand was fueled by strong growth in investment and government
consumption in the second quarter.
Consumer prices in August were 2 percent above their level of
August 1985. The decline in energy prices is slowing while prices of
personal services are increasing at a faster rate, and thus, the decline
of inflation is slowing. Inflation is generally expected to be higher
this fall as additional price controls are removed.
The French trade balance improved further in August. For the first
eight months of 1986 the trade deficit was about $0.5 billion
(s.a.a.r.), down significantly from the $2.8 billion deficit in the same
period last year. The decline in the trade deficit was primarily due to
savings on energy imports that offset a deterioration in the surplus on
manufactures trade. For the first half of 1986 the current account was
in surplus, in contrast to a year-earlier deficit.
In the United Kingdom, real activity has continued to increase at a
moderate rate. The output measure of real GDP increased by an estimated
2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, and was about 1.5 percent
above its year-earlier level. Industrial production rose more than 3
percent (s.a.) in July and was 2.4 percent above its year-ago level.

IV-22
Retail sales decreased by 1.2 percent (s.a.) in July, and were up 4.3
percent on a year-over-year basis. The unemployment rate was unchanged
(s.a.) in July at a record high 11.7 percent.
In August, retail prices increased by 0.3 percent (n.s.a.) and were
2.4 percent above year-earlier levels. Average earnings increased by
0.8 percent (s.a.) in June and were up 8.1 percent on a year-over-year
basis as real earnings continue to rise sharply.
The current account remained in slight surplus (s.a.) in July. The
cumulative trade deficit through July of this year was $9.1 billion
(s.a.a.r.), compared with a deficit of $3.2 billion in the comparable
period last year. This year's larger deficit is accounted for largely
by a fall in the value of net oil exports. Also, the dollar value of
the non-oil deficit has risen, reflecting the appreciation of the pound
relative to the dollar since last year.
Economic expansion in Canada has slowed considerably in 1986 from
last year's pace. Growth in real gross domestic product was 3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter after a slower first quarter pace of
2.1 percent. This brings average 1986 growth of GDP to 2.6 percent
(s.a.a.r.) since the fourth quarter of last year, compared with 3.9
percent growth over the preceding four quarters. Most of the
second-quarter growth resulted from strong consumer and housing demand,
which was somewhat offset by a decline in business fixed investment.
The unemployment rate in Canada fell in August to 9.7 percent after
increasing in July to 9.9 percent.
Although inflation has remained relatively low, it has increased
slightly in 1986 thus far. In August, consumer prices were 4.3 percent

IV-23
above year-earlier levels, an increase from the 4 percent rate in the
preceding 12-month period. Inflation of industrial product prices has
continued to decline, however, standing at 0.3 percent in the 12 months
ending in July of this year, compared with 2 percent in the 12 months
ending in July 1985.
In July, Canada posted its first merchandise trade deficit in 10
years, bringing the cumulative trade surplus to $3.2 billion (s.a.) for
the first seven months of 1986 compared with $7.7 billion in the
comparable period in 1985. The current account deficit also declined in
the second quarter to $1.3 billion (s.a.) bringing the cumulative
deficit in the first half of 1986 to $3.4 billion, compared with a
surplus of $1 billion over the same period last year.
In Italy, real GDP rose by 3.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second
quarter, after increasing 4.7 percent in the first quarter, bringing the
year-over-year growth rate to 3 percent.
The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent (n.s.a.) in August,
bringing the 12-month inflation rate to 5.9 percent compared with an 8.6
percent rate for the previous 12-month period. Wholesale prices fell
0.8 percent (n.s.a.) in July, leaving this index 2.2 percent below its
year earlier level.
In July, the trade deficit was $0.5 billion (s.a.); during the
first seven months of 1986, the cumulative trade deficit was $6 billion
(s.a.a.r.), as compared with a deficit of almost $14 billion in the same
period of 1985.

IV-24
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries. Mexico's
negotiations with commercial banks for a $6 billion bank financing
package are proceeding slowly in the face of Mexico's desire for
substantially easier terms in the restructuring of old debt. Responding
to a flare-up of inflation in July and August, Argentina implemented
tighter monetary policy and stiffened wage and price controls for the
remainder of 1986. Brazil raised interest rates in order to restrain
the continuing rapid expansion of domestic demand and to relieve
pressure on controlled prices. Responding to complaints from foreign
banks that the Venezuelan government had imposed a unilateral
rescheduling of private sector debt, the Venezuelan Congress repealed
the offending legislation; the issue of the mechanism by which private
debt to external creditors is to be repaid remains open. In early
September, Nigeria's Finance Minister signed a letter of intent for an
IMF stand-by program.
Individual Country Notes. On September 8, the IMF Executive Board
approved in principle an 18-month, stand-by arrangement of SDR 1.4
billion for Mexico, with provision for increased credit up to SDR 0.8
billion if oil prices fall below specified levels. The initial disburse-
ment will be contingent on a finding that satisfactory arrangements for
financing the estimated balance of payments deficit during the 18-month
period have been made. Such a finding must be made by September 29, 1986,
although that deadline could be extended. The stumbling block is the
provision of $6 billion in new money from the commercial banks. Nego-
tiations between the banks and the Mexicans are continuing. Mexico
considers it essential to obtain from the banks easier terms than those

IV-25
of the 1985 multi-year restructuring agreement. Total financing require-
ments are estimated at $12 billion. A $1.6 billion bridging loan from
the monetary authorities of a number of industrial and developing
countries and commercial banks was announced on August 27. An initial
drawing of $850 million from official creditors took place on August 29,
and will be repaid from IMF and IBRD disbursements. A commercial bank
component of the bridge loan, for $500 million, will be available only
when about 90 percent of the $6 billion medium-term credit from banks is
committed.
In August, Mexican oil export prices averaged about $11.30 per
barrel, an increase of about $3.30 from the July average. The volume of
crude oil exported, which had fallen to about 1.1 million barrels per
day in January-April, averaged about 1.4 million barrels per day in
May-July. Following the August 4 announcement of an OPEC cut in output,
Mexico announced a 10 percent cut for two months in its self-imposed
export ceiling, from 1.5 to 1.35 million barrels per day.
In August, the Mexican CPI rose by 8 percent. Deposit interest
rates were increased twice but lag behind Treasury bill rates. The
Treasury bill rate stood at 101.5 percent at the September 10 auction.
With deposit rates more than 10 percentage points lower, the banks were
losing deposits. The peso price of the dollar in the controlled market
continued to rise at the monthly rate of 10 percent in August and early
September, as it had in July, and the spread between the free and
controlled rates remained under 3 percent. In the first half of 1986,
industrial production was 2.7 percent lower than in the same period of
1985.

Last month, Argentina adopted measures to slow accelerating infla-
tion, including wage and price controls along with monetary restraint.
Monthly inflation rose from 4-5 percent per month in the second quarter
to 6.8 percent in July and 8.8 percent in August. Under controls
announced August 29, industrial price increases are to be limited to 3
percent in September, declining thereafter each month with a maximum
permissible increase of 2 percent for December. This complements
actions taken earlier in August to tighten monetary policy and to
accelerate the mini-devaluations of the austral to a rate that fully
compensates for changes in the domestic price level. The government
hopes to achieve an inflation rate target of 2.5 percent per month by
year-end and in September resumed negotiations with the IMF on a new
economic program.
Brazil's trade surplus in August remained about $1 billion despite
accelerating non-oil imports. For the first eight months of 1986,
Brazil's trade surplus was $8.2 billion, compared with $7.8 billion in
the same period a year earlier.
Brazil's central bank fostered an interest rate rise over the last
several weeks in an effort to stem domestic demand in the midst of a
booming economy. Inflationary forces are building and the government
hopes to restrain demand to relieve pressures on price controls. The
overnight rate increased from 2.7 percent per month at the beginning of
August to 4 percent at the beginning of September. This complements the
modest fiscal measures that were taken in July. Official estimates for
1986 indicate that even with the July measures the public sector
borrowing requirement will be 4.7 percent of GDP.

Consumer prices rose by 1.2 percent according to the official index
in July; the official price index has increased by less than 5 percent
during the first five months of the Cruzado Plan. However, increasingly
price controls are being evaded and supplies are unavailable.
On September 4, Brazil's agreement with banks to reschedule $6
billion in 1985 maturities and to roll over $9 billion in 1986 maturities
and $15 billion in trade and interbank lines until March 1987 became
effective.
In mid-September, the Venezuelan Congress repealed legislation
passed in July for the Exchange Compensation Fund (FOCOCAM) to
coordinate rescheduling of some private sector external debt. Through
FOCOCAM, the government would have issued 15-year, 5 percent
dollar-denominated bonds against local currency deposits. Finance
Minister Azpurua has not yet provided precise details as to the form of
any new arrangement with respect to private sector debtors.
The Philippines has yet to take prior actions in the financial and
trade sectors required for IMF approval of a new 18-month stand-by
arrangement. The World Bank has found unsatisfactory the specific
proposals presented by the Philippine government for the reform of
various government financial institutions. Unless the government
liberalizes treatment of some import items by September 30 and pro-
vides the World Bank a satisfactory plan for reform of government
financial institutions, IMF Board approval of the stand-by program is
unlikely to occur by late October.
In early September, Nigeria signed a letter of intent for an IMF
stand-by program, but does not intend to draw IMF funds. The program

will not go to the Board until the government opens the long-awaited
free foreign exchange market, which is expected around October 1. A
meeting between the Nigerians and commercial banks took place on
September 11-12 in London. The Bank Steering Committee agreed to
recommend continued deferral of principal through December 31. The
Nigerians are seeking about $320 million in new money from the banks;
the two sides will meet again the first week of October.
On August 15, 1986, the IMF Board declared Peru ineligible to make
further use of IMF resources. Peru's arrears to the Fund have been
accumulating since September 1985; they totalled $161 million on August
15. Despite continuing buildups of arrears to most creditors, Peru's
reserves (less gold) had dropped to $1.6 billion by June, down from
$1.9 billion in January.
Although President Garcia's commitment to hold the official
exchange rate for the dollar through next July has precluded a direct
devaluation, the government adjusted eligibilities under Peru's complex
three-tiered exchange system to effect a de facto devaluation. Despite
the adjustment, the real effective exchange rate faced by exporters is
still 10 percent higher than it was in June 1985.
The IMF Board approved in August an SDR 75 million stand-by
arrangement and SDR 40 million Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF)
drawing for Ecuador, and commercial banks over-subscribed to the new
$200 million oil trade facility. The CFF was the first for an OPEC
country to compensate for a shortfall in oil receipts. As part of its
economic program, Ecuador devalued the sucre by about 35 percent,
removed certain interest rate ceilings and eliminated import controls on
a wide range of products.
