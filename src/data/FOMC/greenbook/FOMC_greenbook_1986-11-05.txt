The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity picked up in the third quarter, with real GNP
growth at a 2.4 percent annual rate according to the Commerce Department's
preliminary estimate. Consumer expenditures increased rapidly through
September, as incentive programs boosted the demand for new cars and led
to a substantial reduction in the level of auto inventories. Although
capital spending was flat during the quarter, new orders were up in
September, and oil and gas well drilling appears to be leveling off.
Housing starts have trended downward in the past several months, but,
reflecting normal lags, residential construction expenditures rose through
the summer. Wage increases continued to moderate; however, price inflation
increased a bit in the third quarter in response to a spurt in food
prices and somewhat smaller declines in energy prices than in the first
half of the year.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production edged up 0.1 percent in both August and
September, following an upward-revised 0.5 percent increase in July; on a
quarterly average basis, output grew at a 2-1/4 percent annual rate in
the summer months. The September advance was concentrated in consumer
durables and business equipment, where higher automobile and truck assemblies
offset declines in other categories. In addition, the production of
construction supplies and defense and space equipment rose further. But
output of business supplies was down, and materials production was flat.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities was
unchanged in September at 79.2 percent. The utilization rate in mining

continued to decline while the rate in manufacturing edged up 0.1
percentage point, reflecting the pickup in motor vehicle production.
Among individual industries, textiles, paper, and petroleum refining
continued to operate at relatively high rates, while capacity use
remained low in the metal and machinery-producing industries.
Employment and Unemployment
Employment growth was relatively sluggish in September, as nonfarm
payroll employment increased 107,000-only 80,000, after adjusting for
strike activity. The average monthly gain for the third quarter as a
whole (130,000) fell short of the average increase over the first half of
the year.
The September report painted a weak picture of labor demand in
manufacturing. A revision to the August data erased half of an earlier-
reported gain in (strike-adjusted) factory jobs, and September payrolls
were down noticeably. By industry, monthly changes in employment continue
to be quite small throughout the nondurable goods sector and in many
durable goods industries. However, persistent cutbacks still are being
reported in the machinery, electrical equipment, and primary metals
industries; these three industries account for more than three-quarters
of the drop in manufacturing employment this year. In other sectors, the
number of construction jobs was little changed in September, while hiring
in services, trade, and finance slowed somewhat from their recent rapid
pace.
Employment in the household survey declined in September, after a
four-month period in which gains substantially exceeded those recorded in

the payroll survey. These relative movements can be attributed in large
part to the behavior of married women, whose labor force participation
this year evidently has not followed traditional seasonal patterns.
Fewer women left the work force at the end of the school year, boosting
employment from June to August; subsequently, the upswing in their employment
this September was much smaller than usual. Unemployment rose somewhat
last month, particularly among younger workers, and the civilian jobless
rate moved back up to 7 percent.
Personal Consumption and Income
Real consumption spending continued to show considerable strength in
the third quarter, increasing at a 7-1/4 percent annual pace, after
growing at a 5 percent annual rate during the first half of the year. The
third-quarter increase was led by a jump in expenditures on motor vehicles,
as auto and truck sales soared following the expansion of sales incentive
programs by domestic automakers in late August. During September, domestic
cars sold at a record 11.8 million unit annual rate, up from an average
8-1/4 million unit pace in the preceding five months; U.S.-built light
trucks registered a 5.0 million unit sales pace-also a monthly record.
Foreign cars sold at a record 3.8 million unit rate in September, in part
because General Motors also offered incentive programs on its "captive
imports." Outside of motor vehicles, outlays on durable goods grew
somewhat more slowly in September, although for the third quarter as a
whole, real spending increased at a 13 percent annual rate, reflecting
especially strong sales of home electronic equipment.

II-8
In contrast to durables, expenditures on nondurable goods decelerated
to a 1 percent annual rate of increase in the third quarter from an 8
percent annual rate in the second quarter. Although spending for most
categories of nondurable goods was sluggish in recent months, gasoline
purchases were relatively strong again in the third quarter, possibly
reflecting higher demand at the lower level of prices. Meanwhile, outlays
for consumer services continued to grow moderately, increasing at a 3-1/2
percent annual rate during the third quarter.
Real disposable personal income fell at a 2-1/4 percent annual rate
in the third quarter after increasing at a 7 percent pace in the previous
period. The decline in real income growth reflects a drop in farm subsidies
from their high second-quarter levels, a large increase in personal
taxes, and higher consumption prices. As a result of the strong advance
in consumption and the poor income performance, the saving rate averaged
only 2.9 percent in the third quarter, down sharply from around 5 percent
in the preceding two quarters.
Business Fixed Investment
Spending for business fixed investment is estimated to have been
virtually flat in the third quarter. Although business purchases of
motor vehicles advanced at nearly a 35 percent annual rate, spending for
most other components of equipment was down, and outlays for nonresidential
structures declined substantially for the third consecutive quarter.
Most of the decline in construction outlays was concentrated in
petroleum drilling activity, where real spending fell 13 percent (quarterly
rate). Drilling has been the weakest component of nonresidential structures

point at an annual rate over the first three quarters. In contrast, BEA
estimates that spending in the remaining categories of nonresidential
construction was down only slightly in the third quarter, as gains in
outlays for retail stores and warehouses about offset continued declines
in the industrial and office sectors. With office vacancy rates at
record-high levels and new commitments down sharply, a continued contraction
in outlays for these buildings is expected.
On the equipment side, real outlays have been quite volatile on a
quarterly basis, but, on balance, have expanded at a 5-1/4 percent annual
rate over the past year. Much of the quarterly volatility reflects the
bunching of outlays at the end of 1985, owing to the expectation of
adverse tax changes for equipment installed during or after 1986.
About one-half of the total rise in equipment outlays during the past
year has been for aircraft and computing equipment, with smaller gains
spread across several other categories. The uptrend in spending results,
in part, from the apparent drop in real long-term interest rates during
the past two years, from continuing efforts by firms to modernize production
facilities, and from growth in the airline industry.
This higher real equipment spending has not translated into increased
domestic production of business equipment, as U.S. firms have been directing
an increasing share of their equipment demand to foreign suppliers. As a
result, shipments of nondefense capital goods by domestic manufacturers
have been essentially flat in nominal terms since late 1984, and domestic
production of business equipment currently is 1/2 percent below its level

II-11
of a year ago. The modest third-quarter advance in shipments represents
no significant break from this longer-term pattern.
Looking ahead, new orders for nondefense capital goods rose nearly
9 percent in September, as bookings for aircraft surged. Outside of
aircraft, gains also were widespread, which may reflect tax factors
similar to those at work late last year. As part of the recently enacted
tax reform package, less generous depreciation rules will apply to most
types of equipment installed after year-end,1 and firms may be ordering
now to beat this deadline. Given this tax incentive, shipments may be
boosted in the fourth quarter before falling off early next year.
Business Inventories
Except for the sharp liquidation by auto dealers during August and
September, business inventory changes appear to have been relatively
moderate in recent months. In manufacturing, a buildup in stocks of
petroleum, chemicals, and processed food products in July and August was
partially offset by a continued reduction in metals and machinery inventories.
Overall, manufacturers' inventory position has changed little in recent
months. In the trade sector, wholesale inventories have grown rapidly
since May, apparently reflecting the continued high volume of imports.
In retail trade, nonauto inventories edged up a bit in July and August,
after stocks in this sector were drawn down substantially in late spring.
1. For aircraft, communications equipment, and most types of industrial
machinery, the Tax Reform Act increases depreciation lives from five to
seven years and provides an incentive to install such equipment this year.
A similar incentive applies to autos and light trucks, for which depreciation
periods will be lengthened from three to five years. In contrast, other
assets-notably computing equipment and heavy trucks-will receive more
generous depreciation allowances under the new law. However, because firms
have the option of using these new rules in the second half of 1986, little
shifting of expenditures into 1987 is likely for these assets.

II-13
The auto inventory overhang that developed in the spring now appears
to have been largely corrected. Auto dealers' stocks were drawn down
sharply in August and September as assembly schedules were scaled back
and the new round of incentives boosted car sales to record levels. At
the end of September, auto dealer stocks were estimated at 1.4 million
units, in sharp contrast to 1.8 million units last spring.
Housing Markets
Total private housing starts declined 8 percent in September to a
1.68 million unit annual rate from about 1.8 million units during July
and August. Single-family starts fell 7 percent in September to a 1.12
million unit annual rate, the lowest monthly reading since December 1985.
Declines also have been recorded for in new home sales, which, in August,
were 25 percent below their second-quarter average. In contrast, other
indicators suggest some strength in the single-family segment of the
market. Sales of existing homes registered their third consecutive
monthly increase in September to establish a new seven-year high, while
consumer attitudes toward homebuying remain very positive.
Multifamily housing starts fell 9 percent in September to a 564,000
unit annual rate, after a 4 percent decline the previous month. Further
downward adjustments seem likely in light of record high vacancy rates
for multifamily units,2 diminished rates of return on rental properties
in the wake of tax reform, and reduced stimulus to construction from
tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued at the end of last year.
2. Rental apartments recently have accounted for 80 percent of total
multifamily construction.

The rate of appreciation in existing home prices has slowed recently.
In August and September, existing home prices were only 7 percent higher
than a year ago, down from double-digit gains in the spring. In contrast,
the rate of increase in new home prices has remained high, hitting 17
percent in the 12 months ending in August; however, a considerable part
of this run-up likely reflects changes in the mix of sales towards larger,
better-equipped homes.
Federal Government
Real federal purchases (on an NIA basis) were about unchanged
between the second and third quarters. Defense spending rose slightly,
following a surge of 20 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter.
This seesaw pattern of spending largely reflects the erratic delivery of
equipment--such as aircraft (including the B1 bomber), missiles (MX and
others), and vehicles-that was authorized for purchase in earlier years.
The federal deficit (unified basis) reached a record $221 billion
in FY1986, up from $212 billion in FY1985. Revenues rose only 5 percent
in FY1986, half the pace of the previous two years, as sluggish economic
growth and low inflation held down the growth of the tax base and the
drop in oil prices reduced excise tax receipts. Outlays were up 4-1/2
percent over the year, but this relatively slow rate of spending growth
was from a FY1985 base that was elevated by a one-time payment of $14
billion for HUD-guaranteed housing loans. In FY1986, particularly large
outlay increases were recorded in defense (8 percent) and agriculture
(22.5 percent). In addition, social security and medicare payments
continued to rise at a 5-1/2 percent rate, and the growth of federal debt

II-16
pushed net interest payments up 4-3/4 percent despite the decline in
interest rates.
The Congress completed action on FY1987 budget legislation prior to
adjournment on October 18 with the enactment of a reconciliation bill and
an unusual continuing resolution; both measures have been signed by the
President. The reconciliation bill was designed to reduce the FY1987
deficit almost $12 billion through the sale of assets, increased IRS
enforcement activities, changes to a number of entitlement programs
(principally medicare), and several small revenue increases. The continuing
resolution folded all thirteen appropriation bills into one act that
provides $577 billion in FY1987 budget authority. The increases in
authority for defense were quite moderate by comparison with recent
years, but outlays can be expected to continue to rise on the basis of
prior-year authorizations; small increases or reductions were made in
authority for other budget functions. Together, the two budget measures
appear to meet the requirements of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to keep
the deficit at or below $154 billion, without taking into account the
added revenues from the first year of tax reform. Even so, most
analysts believe that the deficit will turn out to be larger than $154
billion.
State and Local Government
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
increased at a 6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, only somewhat
below the 8-3/4 percent pace of the second quarter. Real construction
spending rose at a 30 percent annual rate; when combined with the 61

II-17
percent second-quarter rise, this surge was the largest for any two
quarters since 1949. Despite the first drop in employment in three years,
real outlays for compensation also increased in the third quarter, apparently
reflecting a rise in compensation for teachers.
The fiscal position of states and localities remains mixed. Budget
positions have continued to erode in most energy and farm states, while in
contrast, the fiscal situation in most New England and mid-Atlantic
states remains quite healthy. Many states under budgetary pressure are
hoping that tax reform will provide some improvement in their fiscal
position next year. About thirty states couple their income taxes to
either federal adjusted gross income or federal taxable income, both of
which are expected to rise as a result of the base-broadening aspects of
tax reform. Financially-distressed states are expected to retain part or
all of that windfall. Others, however, are considering various means of
dealing with these increased receipts and, in many states, this has
become an important campaign issue.
Exports and Imports
Based on preliminary GNP estimates,3 the volume of merchandise
exports rose 6 percent in the third quarter and the volume of imports was
up 5-1/2 percent (quarterly rates). Although the increase in exports was
the largest quarterly advance in several years, it was concentrated
mainly in the aircraft category. Based on available data (July and
August), there appears to be little increase in exports of machinery or

for both the prices and volume of merchandise trade and are subject to
revision when the actual data become available.

II-18
consumer goods from their second-quarter levels and only a small increase
in exports of industrial supplies. The rise in imports in the third
quarter was dominated by a large swing in oil imports; excluding oil,
import volume expanded 2-1/2 percent, with the gains evenly spread among
capital goods, automobiles, and industrial supplies.
BEA estimates that import prices were little changed in the third
quarter, as declines in the prices of oil and food imports were offset by
increases in the prices of various manufactured products. However, the
prices of imported non-oil industrial supplies were up in the third quarter,
after declining for the past two years.
Prices
Although the overall rate of inflation picked up a bit during the
third quarter, the acceleration mainly reflected movements in food and
energy prices. Excluding food and energy items, the consumer price index
rose 0.3 percent in September, about the same as the average monthly pace
so far this year.
Petroleum prices moved up sharply at the wellhead and refinery
levels in the September PPI, reflecting the rebound in spot market prices
for crude oil that followed the early-August OPEC meeting. These higher
crude costs also appeared at the retail level in September, with gasoline
prices rising 2-1/2 percent and heating fuel prices up 1 percent. Although
OPEC recently agreed to extend its production limitations until the end
of the year, stocks are high and should continue to restrain upward pressure
on retail energy prices in the near term.
Food prices increased rapidly in July and August, mainly reflecting
reduced supplies of pork and summer drought conditions in the Southeast.

By September, however, supply conditions had improved somewhat, and food
prices rose only 0.4 percent in the CPI for that month. Beef and pork
prices continued to rise, but at a less rapid pace than in earlier months,
while fresh poultry prices declined from their summer highs.
Outside of the food and energy sectors, the CPI inflation rate
remained moderate through September. Both new and used car prices registered
small increases, while apparel prices were up almost 2 percent over the
July to September period, reflecting higher prices for fall merchandise.
The August and September advances for nonenergy services were somewhat
lower than in previous months, mainly because of smaller rent increases
in August and a large decline in auto finance charges in September.
Excluding food and energy, the PPI for finished goods rose 0.3
percent in September, owing mainly to sizable increases in auto and light
truck prices, despite widespread incentive programs. The PPI often is
distorted at this time of year by measurement and seasonal adjustment
problems associated with end-of-model-year liquidation allowances in
September and the subsequent switch to the pricing of new-model vehicles
in October.
Wages and Labor Costs
Recent data on wages and compensation suggest that low rates of
price inflation, combined with little improvement in unemployment rates,
have exerted downward pressure on wage growth this year. According to
the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI), which is based on a separate survey
of employers, wages and salary rates in private industry rose about 3-1/2

percent over the past 12 months, down from the 4 percent advance for 1985.
The rise in fringe benefits also has remained moderate and, as a result,
hourly compensation in the ECI also is up at a 3-1/2 percent rate so far
this year. The other measure of hourly compensation in the nonfarm business
sector, which is derived from the national income accounts and the BLS
establishment survey, shows a slightly faster slowing in compensation growth-
from 4 percent in 1985 to a 2-1/2 percent annual rate over the first three
quarters of this year.
In general, the deceleration in wage inflation this year has
been widespread across industries and occupations. Pay gains at service-
producing establishments have slowed especially sharply in recent quarters,
but pay increases in manufacturing also moderated further. By occupation,
hourly compensation has slowed considerably this year for white-collar
workers, but the size of increases for this group continues to outpace
those for blue-collar workers.
Wage increases continue to be especially small in the unionized
sector. Negotiated wage adjustments for the 1.8 million private industry
workers reaching new settlements so far this year averaged just 1.3 percent
in the first year of the agreement and 1.9 percent over the life of the
contract, exclusive of lump-sum payments and COLAs. In many contracts,
however, lump-sum payments have been negotiated in lieu of general wage
increases; indeed, more than one-third of the workers covered by settlements
reached so far this year--including workers in communications, steel, and
aerospace-will receive lump sums. Nevertheless, when viewed as a whole,
the union sector remains a source of wage restraint. Not only have new

II-23
settlements been quite small, but low rates of price inflation have
virtually eliminated COLA payments this year. As a result, wage increases
for unionized workers, which this year have averaged about 2-1/4 percent
in the ECI compensation measure (which includes lump sums), remain well
below the 4 percent average for nonunion workers.
Despite the deceleration in wage growth, slow productivity growth
has caused most of the increase in hourly compensation to be passed
directly through into unit labor costs. Productivity was little changed
in the third quarter and has risen just 0.3 percent over the past year.
Unit labor costs were up 2 percent in the third quarter and 2-1/2 percent
over the past year.

in the vicinity of 5-7/8 percent, other rates have fluctuated over the
intermeeting period in response to incoming economic data and to any
indications of official attitudes here and abroad regarding possible policy
actions. Although some of the more noticeable rate declines in recent
weeks have been in the intermediate and long-term sectors, the term
structure of rates basically has maintained the steeper upward slope that
emerged over the summer.
M1 and M2 decelerated in September, and while some reacceleration
appears in train for October, their expansion has remained below the rates
seen in prior months. The slower rise in M1 has reflected primarily a
sharp drop in demand deposit growth; inflows to NOW accounts have remained
strong, as have the liquid retail categories of the nontransactions component
of M2. M2 has remained near the upper bound of its 1986 growth range, while
Ml is still far above its range, registering velocity declines of a magnitude
unparalleled in recent decades. M3 growth in September was closely in line
with its average for the year, keeping this aggregate at the upper limit of
its range, and early indications are that M3 will slow somewhat this month.
Debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors likely continued to rise rapidly
in September. Household borrowing undoubtedly was boosted by the surge in
auto sales stemming from cut-rate financing promotions, and mortgage credit
growth appears brisk. In contrast, credit use by nonfinancial businesses
in September appears to have diminished in both short- and long-term markets.
Federal borrowing had been comparatively light for several weeks, reflecting

debt ceiling constraints, but the recently enacted increase in the debt
ceiling is enabling the Treasury to bring to market a substantial volume
of securities, including the midquarter financing. The tax-exempt bond
market also appears to be rebounding somewhat after a lull in issuing
activity, now that various impediments have been removed by the enactment
of tax reform.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 growth fell in September to a 10 percent annual rate, reflecting
an abrupt halt to demand deposit growth as well as some slowing of OCD
growth--albeit only to a 26 percent annual rate. Partial data for October
suggest only a slight pickup in demand deposit growth, while OCD growth
appears to have rebounded to about its average pace of the summer.
The slowdown in M1 growth in September combined with somewhat reduced
growth in nontransactions balances to produce a deceleration in M2, to a
7-1/2 percent annual rate of expansion. Overnight RPs declined markedly,
reflecting a substitution of term financing, and small time deposits again
ran off rather sharply. Savings deposits, however, continued to grow
rapidly, increasing at a 23-1/2 percent annual rate, about the average pace
of the previous four months. In October, the nontransactions component of
M2 appears to have picked up despite increased outflows from small time
deposits: overnight RPs have resumed growing, and the remaining nontrans-
actions components of M2 all seem to be expanding at faster rates than in
September.
Patterns of retail deposit growth continue to be influenced by rela-
tive movements in interest rates. The particular strength of passbook
savings apparently reflects the fact that, although some institutions have

lowered the rates paid on these accounts, most have been reluctant to risk
disturbing a long profitable class of stable deposits. The interest rate
spread of 6-month retail CDs over savings accounts has narrowed sharply
since the second quarter, and the rate advantage of MMDAs has virtually
disappeared. Even the slow-to-adjust rates on NOW accounts have fallen
more rapidly than savings rates, placing the average rate on NOWs below
that on savings accounts.

Despite the slowdown in M2, M3 growth in September matched the 9
percent pace of the preceding month. The pickup in the non-M2 component
of M3 was paced by increases in institution-only money funds, term RPs, and
Eurodollars. Large time deposits ran off a bit in September and appear to
have dropped noticeably in October. Large CDs have been declining through-
out much.of this year; commercial banks experiencing earnings pressures
have contributed to this decline, but the weakness in CDs has been wide-
spread.
Bank credit growth slowed somewhat in September; nonetheless, owing
to a large month-average increase in securities holdings, asset expansion

remained at a double-digit annual rate. The bulk of this rise reflected
purchases of securities around the beginning of the month; during the
remainder of September, banks sold off both U.S. government and state
and local securities on balance. Loan growth moderated in September, as
real estate loans expanded somewhat less rapidly and business loans grew
only marginally. Foreign-related institutions accounted for the increase
in business loans, in part through their continued extensive participation
in merger-related loans.1 In October, business loan growth seems to have
picked up somewhat, but declines in security loans outstanding and in bank
holdings of state and local securities probably have depressed the growth
of total bank credit to a rate well below that of the third quarter.
Corporate Finance
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses appears to have diminished in
September as the weakness in business loans at banks was accompanied by
a paydown of outstanding commercial paper and a reduction in gross offer-
ings of corporate bonds. Incomplete data for October provide a mixed
picture for credit growth this month; outstanding nonfinancial commercial
paper and business loans at large banks rose in the first part of the
month, but corporate bond volume has eased somewhat further.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations declined abruptly
in September in conjunction with the sharp drop in share prices around
midmonth. Although activity has picked up again since the market has
firmed, gross offerings have remained well below the volume of share
retirements. Provisions of the Tax Reform Act that will reduce the tax

business loans at foreign-related institutions is that these lenders
are not subject to the capital guidelines imposed on U.S.-chartered banks.

III-8
advantages of some types of mergers after year-end have contributed to
a hectic pace of corporate acquisitions, LBOs, and share repurchases.
The backup in corporate bond yields in early September discouraged
public offerings of bonds in domestic markets by financial as well as non-
financial firms. Mortgage-backed bonds--mainly CMOs--accounted for more
than half of September issuance by financial institutions, and the volume
of these bonds is expected to increase further in October. This increased
issuance, as well as that of other asset-backed securities, appears to have
boosted total gross offerings by financial corporations to a record level
in October.
The family of asset-backed securities has expanded to include those
backed by automobile loans, computer leases, and credit card receivables
as well as home mortgages. Securities backed by car loans have been
particularly popular, totaling some $4.4 billion during the first three
quarters of this year, with an additional $4-billion offering of debt
securities backed by General Motors Acceptance Corporation automobile
loans in October. These GMAC-backed bonds have three tranches of differ-
ing average maturity and yield and, unlike most asset-backed bonds, will
repay principal according to a fixed schedule without subjecting investors
to prepayment risk (which will be borne by the investment banker). Another
unusual aspect of these asset-backed securities is that investors retain
substantial recourse to the originator/servicer-GMAC--in case of loan
defaults.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The combined deficit of the federal government is projected by the
Board staff to total $59 billion in the fourth quarter, after deficits of

III-9
$54 billion in the third quarter and $221 billion for FY 1986. The pro-
portion of the combined deficit to be financed by marketable Treasury debt
in November and December is greater than that for October and the third
quarter because of both the delayed increase in the debt ceiling and the
anticipation of a continued reduction in the issuance of special nonmarketable
securities to state and local units (SLGs). The debt ceiling constraint
forced the Treasury to draw down its cash balance in late September and
October as it postponed one note offering and scaled down weekly bill
auctions. Enactment of the new debt ceiling-which should provide adequate
leeway until next spring-is allowing the Treasury to catch up on its
financing needs just before the regular midquarter refunding. The expected
reduction in issuance of SLGs during the remainder of the year reflects a
post-tax-reform decrease in state and local government offerings of advance
refunding bonds, which typically have their proceeds placed into SLGs.
In addition to the traditional forms of finance available to the
Treasury, the FY 1987 Budget Reconciliation Act contains provisions for
selling to the public both physical assets and loans; however, the timing
of these sales has not yet been determined. The most notable planned sale
of assets is that of Conrail, which is expected to net some $1.7 billion.
Roughly $3 billion in proceeds are expected in FY 1987 from the sale of
loans, the face value of which totals about $4-1/2 billion; these sales
will be without guarantee or other recourse to the federal government.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies is expected to
fall off in the fourth quarter from the $4-1/2 billion to $5 billion pace
of the two preceding quarters. Debt issuance by the Federal Home Loan
Banks (FHLBs) likely will moderate because the demand by thrift institu-

tions for advances appears to be slowing.1 The external financing needs
of FNMA continue to be reduced by prepayments and sales of older mortgages
from its portfolio. The Farm Credit Banks (FCBs) borrowed a small amount
in September; for the third quarter as a whole, they made only a modest
net paydown of debt and built up liquid assets. It is expected that the
farm credit agencies will resume more sizable paydowns in the fourth quarter,
as the underlying weakness of agricultural loan demand shows through more
fully in the FCBs' financing needs.
Legislation has recently been enacted that will allow the Farm Credit
Banks to improve their reported net income through accounting gimmicks. One
element is the reporting of interest expense as if older, higher-yielding
debt were replaced by securities paying current, lower interest rates. The
FCBs will not be required to realize the implicit capital loss on this balance
sheet restructuring in the current period. Also, they will be allowed to write
off loan losses over a period of 20 years, instead of having to realize them
fully in the current period. These changes do not resolve, in any fundamental
sense, the difficulties faced by the FCBs, and the market has reacted with
skepticism: the spread between interest rates on Farm Credit securities
and those on Treasury debt has widened somewhat since this plan was announced.
For example, the spread at the 6-month maturity is currently 10 to 15 basis
points greater than it had been throughout most of the year (although still
substantially less than at the peak of the FCS financial crisis).
1. The FHLBs have taken steps to broaden the financing options of thrift
institutions. For example, they have issued letters of credit to support
interest rate swaps and debt instruments of member thrifts. Recently, the
FHLBs have developed a plan to lower the cost of brokered deposits to
troubled thrifts by marketing their CDs nationally and issuing letters of
credit to the dealers who sell them.

State and Local Securities Markets
Offerings of tax-exempt securities shriveled after September 1, when
various restrictions on public-purpose securities became effective under
the Tax Reform Act. After massive issuance--$52 billion-in the previous
two months, volume dropped off to less than $5 billion in September. A
pickup in offerings appears to have gotten under way this month, but thus
far it has been of moderate proportions.

The signing of the Tax Reform Act into law may cause issuance of
private-purpose tax-exempt bonds to surge during the remainder of this
year. While the aggregate volume of private-purpose tax-exempt issuing
authority for 1986 contained in the Act is small relative to recent years,
virtually none of this authority has yet been tapped.1 Throughout most
of the year, many potential issuers of these bonds were uncertain as to
1. The aggregate volume of private-purpose tax-exempt bonds authorized by
the Tax Reform Act for 1986, not counting issues of certain exempt private
entities, is about $21 billion. Annual issuance of all such bonds ranged
between $55 billion and $75 billion in the years 1983 to 1985.

how tax reform legislation would affect the tax status of their issues.
Tax reform provisions regarding arbitrage and advance refunding oppor-
tunities, which profoundly affect the attractiveness of issuing these
securities, also were unclear for much of the year. Even now that the Tax
Reform Act has become law, many states have not yet allocated the authority
among competing issuers.1
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates in the primary and secondary mortgage markets have
eased a little over the intermeeting period. At S&Ls, contract rates for
new commitments on conventional fixed-rate home mortgage loans averaged
9.95 percent for the week ending October 24, down 12 basis points since the
last FOMC meeting, and close to the low recorded during the spring. The
effective interest rate on fixed-rate commitments quoted by large mortgage
companies was off by 30 basis points, reflecting similar declines in the
secondary market.
Over the past several months, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have
become more popular relative to fixed-rate loans, according to a Federal
Home Loan Bank Board survey of major institutional lenders; in early
September, one in three conventional loans closed for the purchase of a
single-family home carried an adjustable rate, up from one in five during
June. The growing acceptability of ARMs is attributable to more attractive
pricing; the spread between initial rates on fixed- and adjustable-rate
loans currently exceeds 190 basis points, about half a percentage point
wider than the spread six months ago. Furthermore, over this same interval,
1. Under the Act, state-by-state caps limit the annual volume of all private
purpose tax-exempt bonds (except for certain exempt entities) to greater of
$75 per capita or $250 million for calendar years 1986 and 1987.

lenders have, on average, lowered origination fees on ARMs while raising
fees on fixed-rate loans.
Indicators of lending activity suggest that mortgage debt grew rapidly
during the third quarter. Real estate loans at commercial banks rose at a
13-1/2 percent clip during the period, about the same pace as during the
second quarter. At FSLIC-insured thrifts, mortgage originations reached a
record level in the third quarter. However, holdings of mortgage loans at
these institutions have risen comparatively little due to an extraordinary
level of prepayments and to swapping of residential loans for more liquid
mortgage-backed securities. Issuance of mortgage-backed securities con-
tinues to fuel the major portion of residential mortgage credit; a record
$79 billion of federally related MBSs were issued during the third quarter,
compared with $108 billion for all of 1985.
In October, the first REMICs-Real Estate Mortgage Investment
Conduits--were priced for settlement in January. Created by the Tax Reform
Act, REMICs are tax-favored entities that hold mortgage loans and issue
securities backed by these assets. For issuers of multi-class mortgage-
backed securities, REMICs provide several advantages over collateralized
mortgage obligations (CMOs), and REMICs will eventually supplant CMOs.1
The REMICs issued thus far have been backed by FNMA pass-through securities,
representing pools of conventional, fixed-rate loans.
1. Compared with REMIC securities, CMOs must be structured with various
characteristics--such as overcollateralization-in order to gain favorable
tax treatment, even though these attributes serve no economic purpose.
Two other advantages REMIC securities have over CMOs are that they will
count as qualifying mortgage assets for purposes of determining a thrift's
eligibility for the bad debt reserve deduction, and the securities will be
eligible investments for REITs. The tax reform legislation prohibits
issuance of CMOs after 1991.

Consumer Installment Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit slowed in August to a 7-3/4
percent annual rate from an 11-3/4 percent July advance. The weakness in
August was widespread across most credit types and holders. Auto credit
growth accounted for about two-thirds of the total gain for the third
consecutive month.
Installment credit likely advanced strongly in September, reflecting
the full impact of automakers' concessionary finance programs that began in
late August. Although the largest share of the increase in September auto
credit probably occurred at the captive finance companies, other lenders
also are likely to have experienced significant gains; foreign car sales
were up sharply and a significant number of buyers of domestic cars chose
cash rebates instead of cut-rate financing.
Consumer installment credit growth has slowed appreciably in 1986
from the very rapid pace seen in 1984 and 1985. Installment debt rose
at an annual rate of about 12 percent between December 1985 and August
1986--down sharply from about 20 percent in each of the previous two years.
Excluding auto credit, the slowdown has been even more striking--to 9 per-
cent this year from 17 percent in 1985 and 22 percent in 1984. There is
no evidence-despite increasing loan losses--that lenders are less willing
suppliers of credit. On the demand side, surveys continue to indicate that
an unusually large proportion of consumers still regard borrowing as an
acceptable means to make desired purchases, but a combination of high
relative interest rates on credit cards and record debt burdens may be
tempering borrowing.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown in Chart 1, on a weighted-average basis the foreign-
exchange value of the dollar has gained about 1/4 percent since the
September 23 FOMC meeting. During the first two weeks of the inter-
meeting period, the dollar moved downward, most noticeably against the
mark, as it became apparent that any expectations of interest-rate
reductions in Germany would not be realized. Disappointing U.S. data
and the failure of G-7 authorities to agree on new initiatives in the
international monetary area at the time of the annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank in late September seemed also
to contribute to the dollar's weakness.
.Through mid-October the dollar's value fell by about 3-3/4
percent against the mark and 2-1/4 percent on a weighted-average basis,
but remained relatively flat against the yen and gained steadily against
sterling.
During the past week or so, the dollar has recovered strongly,
primarily against the yen as Japanese institutional investors were
reported to have shifted from yen-denominated assets and toward assets
denominated in dollars. Recent gains have moved the dollar's value
versus the yen to a level 3-3/4 percent above that at the start of the
intermeeting period; against the mark, the dollar is down on balance
about 1-1/4 percent during the same period.

Both short-term and long-term interest-rate differentials have
moved somewhat against the dollar during the intermeeting period.
Foreign short-term interest rates generally have moved upward while U.S.
short-term interest rates have eased slightly. In the United Kingdom,
short-term interest rates increased by about 150 basis points as U.K.
authorities raised their discount and official dealing rates to banks by
a full percentage point in mid-October to counteract strong downward
pressure on the pound, which had fallen to record lows against the mark.
The weakness of sterling appears to be based on concern over rising U.K.
wage costs and decreasing confidence in the Thatcher government. Long-
term interest-rate differentials have exhibited similar movements, as
U.S. long-term rates have eased by about 10 basis points during the
intermeeting period and long-term rates in several foreign countries
including Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom have moved upward by
10-20 basis points.
.In recent weeks, spreads against the mark within the
EMS have narrowed.

IV-4
Bank lending to foreigners in the second quarter. U.S.-chartered
banks' claims on foreigners declined $3 billion in the second quarter of
1986. However, on an exchange-rate-adjusted basis the decrease appears
to have been about $10 billion, because the weighted average dollar fell
5 percent in the second quarter and thereby raised the dollar value of
the banks' nondollar claims by about $7 billion. On an exchange-rate-
adjusted basis, claims fell about $13 billion in the first half of 1986,
following an estimated $29 billion drop in the full year 1985. The 1985
figure reflected inter alia the sale of about $2.3 billion of claims on
non-OPEC developing countries by Crocker National Bank to its U.K
parent, Midland Bank.
In the second quarter, changes in claims on the various country
groups (on an unadjusted basis) were small or nil. Claims on non-OPEC
developing countries dropped $1.8 billion, bringing the cumulative
decline since the end of 1984 to $10 billion (and only slightly more at
constant exchange rates, since probably 95 percent or more of these
claims are dollar-denominated). Within this group, second-quarter
changes in claims on Latin American countries were small, the largest
being a rise of $0.3 billion in claims on Argentina, which drew the
remaining balance of its 1985 bank loan. In Asia, the most notable
changes were further declines in claims on Korea and Taiwan that brought
the cumulative decreases in claims on these countries since end-1984 to
$1.9 billion (almost 20 percent) vis-a-vis Korea and $1.5 billion (30
percent) vis-a-vis Taiwan.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets in the United States rose by nearly $5
billion in August, bringing the increase for the first eight months of the
year to $25 billion. (See line 4 of the summary table on U.S.
International Transactions.) These increases were largely concentrated in
holdings of the G-10 countries
.Partial information for September indicates that G-10
official assets in the United States increased by an additional $5

NT dollar appreciated 6 percent between January and August compared with a
23 percent appreciation of the Japanese yen.) Since July, Treasury
officials have been meeting informally with Taiwan's trade representatives
to discuss the value of the NT dollar and the nearly $10 billion
U.S.-Taiwan trade imbalance. Since August, the NT dollar has appreciated
1-3/4 percent and the central bank has continued to purchase US dollars to
slow its currency's appreciation.
Foreigners other than official reserve holders made net purchases of
$4-3/4 billion in U.S. securities in August, bringing their year-to-August
purchases to $60 billion. Of this total, private investors (excluding

non-monetary international institutions) purchased $11 billion in U.S.
Treasury securities while non-monetary international institutions
(principally the World Bank) sold $4 billion in Treasuries. Although the
level of foreign private purchases of Treasuries remains substantial, the
share of such investments as a proportion of foreign private investment
inflows has declined to 12 percent this year compared with 28 percent last
year and-64 percent in 1984. Along with the shift away from Treasuries
toward corporate securities, foreign investors showed an increased
preference for equities; of the corporate securities purchased by private
foreigners in the first eight months of 1986, 30 percent was equities as
compared with only 10 percent in 1985.
While foreign residents have increased their holdings of U.S.
securities, U.S. residents have decreased their holdings of foreign
securities, following sizable net purchases earlier in the year. The
$1-1/4 billion decline in August (Summary Table, line 2.c) marks the third
consecutive month of net sales, and may reflect a desire by U.S. residents
to realize the dollar capital gains on foreign-currency-denominated assets
resulting from the dollar's depreciation.
Banks reported another large net inflow in August (Summary Table,
line 1). Unlike the July inflow, which was associated with a change in
reporting instructions (discussed in the last Greenbook), the August
inflow was spread over a wide variety of transactions. Deposit
liabilities to foreign nonbanks (particularly the World Bank) increased
and claims on foreign nonbanks (mainly in Europe) fell. Substantial
inflows were also recorded in net transactions with both affiliated and
unaffiliated banks outside the United States.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
For July and August combined, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit
was estimated to be $150 billion at an annual rate on a
balance-of-payments basis; this was roughly the same rate of deficit as
recorded in the previous three quarters (column 7 in the table below).
Both exports and imports rose somewhat during the July-August period.
The value of total exports in July-August was up about 2 1/2 percent
from second-quarter levels. A sharp increase in exports of civilian
aircraft accounted for most of the rise. While there were small increases
in exports of business machines, chemicals and some agricultural

commodities (including wheat, rice, meat), there were also somewhat larger
declines in exports of passenger cars and trucks to Canada, fuel oil, and
soybeans. Thus the recent strength of exports continues to rest on a few
high-value items -- large jet aircraft in July-August and nonmonetary gold
shipments to Japan in the second quarter.
Preliminary estimates in the GNP accounts show a decline in
export prices (fixed-weight) in the third quarter of about 4 percent at an
annual rate; most of the decline was in exports of agricultural
commodities and industrial supplies. Price increases were recorded for
capital, automotive and consumer goods exports. Additional data on export
and import prices will be available on October 30 when the Bureau of Labor
Statistics releases data for the third quarter.
On the import side, the 3 percent rise in value in July-August
from the second-quarter rate was largely in foreign passenger cars,
machinery (business and industrial) and to a lesser extent in some
consumer goods (particularly footwear) and some industrial supplies (for
example, paper). Even so, imports of various other industrial supplies
(especially nonmonetary gold), of various other consumer goods, and of
coffee all declined.
The price of imports, on average, was little changed from second
quarter levels on a fixed weight basis. Declines in prices of food and
oil imports were offset by estimated increases in the price of various
manufactured goods imports. The price of imported industrial supplies
tipped up in the third quarter after declining for the past two years.
The value of oil imports was about the same in July-August as in
the second quarter. However, a strong rise in volume was offset by a
sharp decline in price. Last week OPEC agreed to continue production

IV-13
restraints through December. This decision should allow world oil prices
to continue near current spot-market levels (about $15 per barrel) through
the end of the year. Much of the increase in volume appears to have gone
into inventories, which may, in turn, be drawn down in the fourth quarter.
Uncertainties regarding world oil prices continue to result in wide swings
in the quantity of oil imports from quarter to quarter.

Foreign Economic Developments. Data available so far for the third
quarter suggest further moderate expansion in Germany, France, the
United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent in Japan, following the
second-quarter rebound. The average level of Japanese industrial
production in the third quarter was 3/4 percent below the second-quarter
level, while in Germany, average industrial production in July and
August was 1-3/4 percent above its second-quarter level.
Inflation rates abroad remain modest. The German consumer price
index has declined relative to year-earlier levels in each of the past
seven months through October. Japanese consumer prices in the third
quarter were little changed from their year-ago level. In France, the
United Kingdom and Italy, consumer prices rose 1/4 to 1/2 percent
(n.s.a.) in September, and the year-over-year inflation rates remained
well below last year's rates. In Canada, consumer prices were unchanged
in September, and the 12-month inflation rate approximately equaled last
year's rate. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) have continued to decline in
recent months in Japan and France, but have risen somewhat in Germany,
Italy, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
External surpluses in Japan and Germany continue at record rates
for the year. In Canada and the United Kingdom, the trade balance has
deteriorated recently in comparison with the first half of the year.
Individual Country Notes. Recent Japanese data suggest that the
pace of economic activity is sluggish. The index of industrial
production rose 2.6 percent (s.a.) in September following declines in
July and August. For the three months ending in September, industrial
production was 0.6 percent above the year-ago level. The Ministry of

IV-18
International Trade and Industry (MITI) attributed these declines to the
impact on exporters of the yen's sharp appreciation. MITI issued a
forecast that industrial output will fall in 1986 for the first time in
10 years. Other economic indicators have been mixed. New housing
starts rose 7.7 percent (s.a.) in September after falling 6.3 percent in
August. The unemployment rate was unchanged in August at a record high
2.9 percent (s.a.). Retail sales have been quite erratic in recent
months, rising 1.9 percent (s.a.) in August after dropping 0.9 percent
in July.
Japanese inflation remains low. Wholesale prices have continued to
decline, and the overall wholesale price index in the third quarter was
11.2 percent below its year-earlier level. The fall in wholesale prices
reflects lower oil product prices and the yen's appreciation. Bank of
Japan officials have said declines in wholesale prices are likely to
narrow starting in October reflecting current stable prices of many
primary commodities in overseas markets.
Despite a slight narrowing of Japan's trade surplus in September,
Japan's cumulative trade surplus for the first nine months of 1986 was a
record $80 billion (s.a.a.r.); the cumulative current account surplus
through August was $78 billion (s.a.a.r.). After six consecutive months
of year-over-year declines, export volume in September rose 3.2 percent
relative to its year-earlier level. Third-quarter export volume was 0.5
percent lower than in the third quarter of 1985. Import volume growth
remains strong, with import volume increasing 18 percent in the third
quarter compared with the third quarter of 1985.

IV-19
A Japanese government tax council has proposed a reform of the tax
system that is intended to be revenue neutral. The council recommended
a substantial lowering of the maximum rates for national and local
income taxes and a reduction in the number of income tax brackets. Some
reduction in the rate on corporate taxes was also recommended. To
offset these tax cuts, the council proposed the introduction of a
value-added tax, and reviews of the tax-free savings system and of the
exemption of individuals from capital gains taxation. The council said
the proposed tax reforms would boost real GNP by 0.1 percentage point.
The council's recommendations will be reviewed by the government and
submitted to parliament by early 1987. The government hopes that tax
reform can be implemented for fiscal year 1987/88 (starting April 1).
Industrial production in Germany declined by 0.3 percent (s.a.) in
August to a level 3.4 percent above August of last year. Production
growth in the three months ending in August was 10.3 percent (s.a.a.r.)
compared with the previous three-month period. The volume of new
manufactured goods orders fell 0.9 percent in August after rising 0.9
percent in July. The July/August new orders index was 2 percent lower
than a year ago, with domestic orders one percent higher, but foreign
orders 6-1/2 percent lower. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at
8.8 percent in September. Unemployment has declined by one-half of one
percentage point over the past 12-months.
Consumer prices fell 0.3 percent in October to a level 0.9 percent
below their year-earlier level. Since December 1985, the CPI has
declined at an annual rate of 1.4 percent. Import prices in September
were 22 percent lower than in September 1985. Wholesale and producers

IV-20
prices in September were 8 and 4 percent below their respective levels
of a year ago. The current account surplus in September was $3.3
billion, bringing the cumulative total so far this year to $23.1
billion, compared with $6.9 billion for the first nine months of last
year.
Central bank money rose 0.8 percent (s.a.) in September from August
and 7.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) relative to the fourth quarter of 1985 target-
base period. The level reached in September was above the upper limit
of the target range for CBM growth for all of 1986--3.5 to 5.5 percent
growth between the fourth quarters of 1985 and 1986.
In France, real activity continued to increase at a moderate rate.
Industrial production rose 0.7 percent (s.a.) in the combined months of
July and August after increasing by a revised 4.6 percent (s.a.) in June.
The index for July and August stood at a level that was 2.2 percent
above its level a year ago. Revised figures indicate real GDP grew 4.8
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter after falling 0.7 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter of 1986. In September, the unemployment
rate (s.a.) remained unchanged at its record high level of 10.7 percent.
The French trade balance was in deficit in September, bringing
the cumulative trade deficit this year to about $1 billion (s.a.a.r.),
compared with a $2.6 billion deficit last year. Recently the increase
in strength of the mark against the dollar has put downward pressure on
the French franc and a postponement of
plans to announce further decontrol of exchange restrictions.
The growth of French M-3 money supply has accelerated recently.
The 3-month moving average of M-3 centered on July rose 5.8 percent

IV-21
from the year-earlier level, compared with the government's target of
holding money supply growth below 5 percent this year.
In September the government announced its 1987 budget that seeks to
cut the deficit and taxes simultaneously. Across-the-board tax relief
for individuals and corporations is to be accompanied by significant
cutbacks in government expenditures.
Real activity in the United Kingdom has continued to increase, but
at a relatively slow pace. The average measure of real GDP rose by only
0.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, and was 1.4 percent above
its year-earlier level. Industrial production was up by 0.5 percent
(s.a.) in August and showed a year-over-year increase of 1.3 percent.
The unemployment rate, after reaching a record high level of 11.7
percent (s.a.) in August, eased back by 0.1 percentage point in
September. Wage increases have continued to exceed price rises by a
wide margin, with average earnings 8.1 percent above their year-earlier
level in August, and 3 percent year-over-year retail price inflation in
September.
The trade deficit in September was $1.3 billion (s.a.), about half
as large as the record high deficit of the previous month. Through the
first nine months of this year, the cumulative trade deficit was
$11.7 billion (s.a.a.r.), substantially exceeding the $2.5 billion
deficit recorded last year. The cumulative current account deficit
through September has been $200 million (s.a.a.r.), compared with a
surplus of $5.2 billion last year.
On October 14, the Bank of England triggered an increase in
commercial banks' base lending rates from 10 to 11 percent. Two days

IV-22
later, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson justified this base rate
increase by the weakness of the pound on exchange markets and the
accelerated growth in recent months of the MO targeted monetary
aggregate. The Chancellor noted that because of distortions arising
from continuing financial innovation, the rapid growth of the other
targeted aggregate, M3, would have relatively little impact on policy.
On October 22, Bank of England Governor Leigh-Pemberton said that
consideration was being given to abandoning broad money targets
altogether.
The London Stock Exchange experienced a major change in operating
procedures--the "Big Bang"--on October 27. In the markets for equities
and government bonds (gilts), there was an elimination of fixed
commissions, a merging of the previously separated roles of brokers (who
acted only as agents for customers) and jobbers (who acted only as
market makers), and entry into the market by British commercial and
merchant banks, and foreign (including U.S.) financial institutions. In
a related development, the Financial Services Bill, which contains a new
framework for financial market regulation, is expected to win
parliamentary approval early next month.
Growth in Canada picked up in July and levelled off in August after
slowing in the first half of 1986. The monthly measure of real gross
domestic product was unchanged in August after increasing 0.6 percent in
July (s.a.); in August, GDP was 4 percent above its year-earlier level.
Industrial production (accounting for about 26 percent of monthly GDP)
rose 0.8 percent (s.a.) in July but fell 0.9 percent (s.a.) in August.
Industrial production in August remained below the pace set for most of

IV-23
last year. More recently, the unemployment rate declined to 9.5 percent
in September (matching June's three-and-a-half year low).
The merchandise trade balance (s.a.) rebounded in August to a
surplus of $315 billion, up from a deficit in July of $135 million. The
improvement in August was the result of slow export growth that was more
than offset by a sharp decline in imports. Through August, the
cumulative merchandise trade surplus stood at $5.5 billion (s.a.a.r.),
down sharply from the cumulative trade surplus of $12.8 billion in 1985.
In Italy, revised data indicate that real GDP rose by 8.9 percent
(s.a.a.r) in the second quarter after having risen 1.3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter. The rate of unemployment fell to 10.7
percent (n.s.a.) in July from a rate of 11.3 percent in April.
The trade surplus in August was $1.7 billion (s.a.), reflecting a
large decrease in imports. The cumulative trade deficit for the first
eight months of 1986 was $2.7 billion (s.a.a.r), compared with a deficit
of $12 billion in all of 1985.
In October, the Chamber of Deputies approved a withholding tax on
interest income earned on Treasury bills. This is the first time in
Italian financial history that an effective tax on interest income has
been imposed. It is unclear whether the imposition of this tax will
reduce nominal payments for the service of the outstanding stock of
public debt because before-tax interest rates on Treasury bills may
rise.

IV-24
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries. At the end of
September, Mexico reached agreement with its bank advisory committee on
a $6 billion loan package and an easing of terms for the repayment of
$44 billion in public sector debt. The IMF Executive Board gave pro-
visional approval to an 18-month stand-by arrangement on September 8.
However, that approval technically expired on September 29 because the
"critical mass" of subscriptions to the financing package was not in
place; the IMF Managing Director has now requested the banks to assemble
the critical mass by October 31. Although the rate of inflation in
Argentina eased slightly in September, the adoption of a 3 percent
monthly depreciation rate for the austral appears likely to lead to a
further appreciation of the real effective exchange rate in the coming
months. Brazil devalued the cruzado against the dollar by 1.8 percent
in mid-October, presumably to prevent further deterioration of its
strong trade surplus that, in fact, declined in September. Venezuela's
agreement with creditor banks to reschedule $21 billion in public sector
debt became effective October 4. The IMF Executive Board approved a new
stand-by program for the Philippines on October 24, and Philippine
officials began negotiations with creditor commercial banks on October
27 to reschedule some $3-1/2 billion in non-trade external debts falling
due in 1987-1992. Since the opening of a new foreign exchange auction
market on September 26, the Nigerian naira has depreciated 62 percent
against the dollar.
Mexico reached agreement with its bank advisory committee at the
end of September on a $6 billion loan package, $500 million of which
would be guaranteed by the World Bank, with provision for: (1) an

IV-25
additional $1.2 billion if specified factors threaten the financing of
the public sector investment program; and, (2) an additional $500
million in 1987, half of which would be guaranteed by the World Bank, if
economic recovery fails to materialize. The committee also agreed to
extend from 1998 to 2006 the repayment schedule of $43.7 billion in
Mexican public sector debts to banks and to lower the spread to 13/16 of
a percentage point over LIBOR with no prime rate option. A $1 billion
portion of the commercial bank loan package will be co-financing of
World Bank loans for the transportation sector.
In September the Mexican CPI increased by 6 percent, reaching a
level 96 percent above a year earlier. The peso price of the dollar in
the controlled market rose by 8 percent in September, reaching a level
147 percent above a year earlier, and in the first 21 days of October,
it rose at a monthly rate of 7 percent. The spread between rates in the
free market and in the controlled market remains under 3 percent. The
effective annual yield on 28-day Treasury bills at the October 22 auction
was 161 percent, compared with a peak of 167 percent in early September.
Effective October 22, the minimum wage was increased by 21 percent,
bringing the minimum wage in real terms to a level 2 percent above that
of a year ago. Industrial production in the first eight months of 1986
was 4.1 percent lower than in the same period of 1985.
The monthly rate of increase in consumer prices for Argentina edged
downward from 8.8 percent in August--the highest figure for the year--to
7.2 percent in September. The rate of depreciation of the austral
against the dollar has declined from 6.15 percent in September to an
expected 3 percent figure for October. This depreciation rate will

IV-26
result in an appreciation of Argentina's real effective exchange rate
unless inflation drops dramatically in the coming months. Recent
increases in expenditures on military salaries and a seasonal
fourth-quarter increase in public wage expenditures will increase the
government's deficit in the fourth quarter relative to the 2.5 percent
of GNP estimated for the third quarter. The rate of money growth has
slowed recently and could lead to a possible recession in the next six
months. Preliminary figures indicate that M1 growth slowed from an
average of 8.0 percent monthly over May-July 1986 to a 1.7 percent
monthly average in August-September 1986. M3 (which includes
regulated-rate and free-rate time deposits) slowed from 6.6 percent
monthly over May-July to 4.7 percent in August-September.
Brazil devalued the cruzado relative to the dollar by 1.8 percent
in mid-October. This was the first adjustment in the rate for the
cruzado since the institution of the Cruzado Plan on February 28, 1986.
The exchange rate change probably reflects the fear of the authorities
that the still strong trade surplus is weakening. The trade surplus
through the first nine months of this year was $9.1 billion, which is
the same-sized surplus that was achieved in the first nine months of
1985. However, the $840 million surplus in September was substantially
below the monthly average of $1.2 billion recorded over the previous six
months.
There is an increasing concern among policymakers in Brazil that
domestic demand will have to be restrained. Real GDP growth is likely
to be about 8 percent in 1986, similar to 1985 growth. Consumer prices
rose at a somewhat faster rate of 1.7 percent in September according to

IV-27
the official index; since the beginning of March, prices, as measured by
the official index, have increased by 8 percent. Price controls are
increasingly being evaded and supplies are often unavailable at
controlled prices.
On October 4, Venezuela's agreement with creditor banks to
reschedule $21.2 billion in public sector debt became effective.
Venezuela will now make a $750 million downpayment (originally due upon
signing in February 1986) to the banks in the final quarter of the year.
Venezuela is seeking to renegotiate the terms of the agreement to extend
maturities and to link future principal payments to developments in oil
prices and interest rates. Progress on these negotiations is likely to
be hindered by uncertainties regarding the repayment of Venezuela's
private sector debt.
On October 24, the IMF Executive Board approved a SDR 422 million,
18-month program for the Philippines. About SDR 224 million was
disbursed immediately by the Fund under the Compensatory Financing
Facility, reflecting a shortfall in Philippine exports, and the
remaining SDR 198 million will be disbursed in seven tranches, with Fund
reviews of the Philippine program in April and October of next year.
The IMF action has cleared the way for the final disbursement of $350
million from the commercial bank creditors' "new money" loan of $925
million approved in May 1985. The Philippines began negotiations with
its commercial bank creditors on October 27 with three main objectives:
(1) to restructure about $3-1/2 billion in debts falling due in
1987-1992; (2) to obtain lower margins than those obtained in the 1985
rescheduling of $6 billion in debt; and, (3) to receive Mexican-type

IV-28
repayment terms of 20 years with 7 years of grace. The bank creditors
have stated that problems could arise if the Philippines insists on a
Mexican-type contingency facility that would require the banks to
provide new credits if certain economic targets, such as growth, are not
reached.
After maintaining an overvalued exchange rate for many years,
Nigeria opened a second-tier foreign exchange market on September 26 to
cover most external transactions through an auction system. External
debt service will continue to be transacted at the official first-tier
rate. Through October 23 the naira had depreciated by 62 percent
against the dollar. In early October, Nigeria's commercial bank
steering committee agreed in principle to a rescheduling package which
includes $320 million in new money during 1987. The offer is contingent
upon an IMF stand-by arrangement. On October 16, the World Bank
Executive Board approved a $452 million loan aimed at supporting the new
foreign exchange market and encouraging trade liberalization. Proceeds
of this loan will be used to fund the auction market. The Bank of
England has organized a $250 million multilateral bridge loan to the
proposed World Bank loan. U.S. Treasury participation will be $37
million.
