The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent indicators suggest that domestic production is continuing to
expand at a moderate rate while domestic spending seems to be slowing.
Labor demand picked up in November when another sizable increase in payroll
employment was coupled with a lengthened workweek. Apart from autos, real
consumer spending apparently rose in October, but this followed a sizable
drop in September. Indicators of business fixed investment remain sluggish,
and October housing starts were below their third-quarter pace. Wage and
price increases--although still moderate-have been somewhat higher than
earlier in the year.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor demand has continued to expand in the fourth quarter, with some
improvement now evident in the industrial sector of the economy. Nonfarm
payroll employment increased 250,000 in November, about the same pace as in
October, but appreciably above the average monthly gain during the first three
quarters of this year. Job growth has continued to be concentrated among
service-producing establishments, although the November increase in trade
employment was small, as a consequence of less seasonal hiring at general
merchandising stores. Employment in manufacturing has risen in each of the
last two months, bringing the number of factory jobs back to about its
mid-year level. Much of the recent rise has occurred in nondurable goods
industries, notably textiles, printing and publishing, and rubber and
plastics. Among durables, both trade restrictions on imports of Canadian
lumber and the earlier strong pace of housing starts apparently have boosted
employment in the U.S. lumber industry in recent months. Sizable

purchases of aircraft have fueled employment growth in transportation
equipment, while gains in the electrical equipment industry have been
associated with a high level of production of home appliances. In contrast,
a number of other durable goods industries remain quite weak. Employment
in metals, on balance, has continued to fall in recent months, and hiring
in nonelectrical machinery remains sluggish, probably owing both to foreign
competition and to the weak demand for computers. Elsewhere, hiring in
construction has leveled off while employment in oil and gas extraction
continued its downward slide, although at a slower pace than earlier in the
year.
When averaged over the past two months, the employment gains reported
in the household survey were similar to the reported payroll gains. Never-
theless, the civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.0 percent in November
for the third consecutive month, with the distribution of joblessness little
changed by demographic group.
Industrial Output and Capacity Utilization
The labor market reports and available physical product data suggest an
improvement in industrial production in November, and although output was
flat in October, the sector appears positioned to record a second quarterly
gain following the weakness in the first half of the year. The October index
was held down by sharp declines in the output of autos and trucks. In
November, motor vehicle output was about unchanged, while gains apparently
were registered in most other industries.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities in
November probably recovered the ground lost in October when it fell 0.2
percent. Nonetheless, the October utilization rate remains around 2 percentage

II-4
points below its most recent peak in the summer of 1984. Capacity growth
has slowed from an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the second half of 1984
to about 2 percent this year.
The Automobile Sector
General Motors recently announced plans to close 11 plants before the
end of 1988. According to GM, these closings are part of a major program
of modernization. The targeted plants employ 29,000 workers, or more than
5 percent of GM's work force, and have a capacity of 800,000 autos as well
as truck and bus assembly lines and stampings facilities. On the other side
of the ledger, GM will have opened six new plants between 1981 and the end of
1987 and refurbished 12 others. On balance, GM's capacity to assemble
autos, which was about 6-1/4 million units in 1979 and is a little higher
currently, probably will be reduced to about 5-3/4 million units by the end
of 1988. GM's plans to cut costs involve relatively larger reductions in
employment than in capacity.
Despite the planned reductions at GM, auto assembly capacity in the
United States may not change much in coming years. Japanese manufacturers
have announced plans to open or expand plants in the United States in
1987 and 1988 that will be able to produce more than 800,000 additional cars,1
placing auto assembly capacity in the United States owned by foreign
manufacturers (excluding AMC/Renault and NUMMI (GM/Toyota)) at about 1-1/2
million units. On balance;total assembly capacity in the U.S. (both

Fuji, Subaru, and Isuzu have plans for a joint-venture plant to open in 1989,

1. The capacity estimates represent capability to assemble automo-
biles; they do not take account of shortages of key components, but
do assume reasonable work patterns. The annual rate of assembly
capacity is based on the historic maximum hourly rate of output for
each assembly plant as reported in Ward's Automotive Yearbooks. The
hourly rate for each plant is multiplied by a fixed number of 3,910
hours worked per year to obtain the annual capacity rate of output.
Although this method is plausible, it leads to estimates that may
never be reached in the aggregate because of shortages of parts or
labor or because demand for some model cars remains low even in
periods of booming automobile sales.

foreign and domestic-owned) is expected to be 11 million units (at an
annual rate) at the end of 1988, the same as in 1979.
The combined sales of domestic and imported cars were at a 10.5 million
unit annual rate in November, up a bit from the 10-1/4 million unit pace in
October. Most of the increase reflected stronger sales of Japanese cars,
which boosted foreign car volume to a 3.6 million unit annual rate in
November. For domestic models, the November pace--which was below that for
the year-to-date--does represent a pickup of sales from the period immediately
after the major incentive programs had expired, although some limited
incentives recently have been introduced.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal personal consumption expenditures fell 2 percent in October,
reflecting the drop in sales of cars and light trucks. However, excluding
motor vehicles and parts, nominal spending increased 0.5 percent in October
after registering no growth in the previous month. Nominal purchases of
gasoline and fuel oil increased 2.2 percent last month; if this figure were
to hold up in subsequent revisions, it would translate into a very sharp
increase in real outlays, given the drop in consumer energy prices registered
in the October CPI. In addition, nominal purchases of food and clothing,
which fell during the third quarter, also increased last month, although
some of this growth may reflect continued inreases in the prices of these
goods. Spending on consumer services increased 0.3 percent in October, a
bit less than in September. Outlays for gas and electric utilities and for
transportation services have been weak in recent months, and spending for
medical services also has slowed.

After strong gains in the first half of 1986, real disposable personal
income declined moderately in the third quarter, reflecting a drop in farm
proprietors' subsidies and a marked slowdown in the growth of real wages
and salaries. In October, nominal personal income rose 4.3 percent at an
annual rate, a little faster than the third-quarter pace, and income growth
in November should get a healthy boost from the increases in production
worker hours and the accompanying rise in hourly wage rates. With spending
down sharply in October, the personal saving rate increased from its
September low of 2.0 percent to 4.1 percent.
Business Fixed Investment
Business investment spending has been mixed in recent months. On the
equipment side, purchases of autos and light trucks probably have been cut
sharply, owing to the expiration of this fall's financing incentives; a
similar drop occurred during the fourth quarter of 1985. In addition,
sales of heavy-weight trucks--not covered by these incentives--have been
weak, falling 13-1/2 percent in October. In contrast, October shipments of
nondefense capital goods rose 2-1/4 percent, with the aircraft group
accounting for all of this gain. Shipments could advance a bit further
during the remainder of the current quarter, judging from the pattern of
orders; but it would take an enormous increase in shipments to offset the
effect of the likely decline in purchases of motor vehicles on overall
equipment spending.
After plunging earlier this year, outlays for nonresidential
structures have firmed a little in recent months. Petroleum drilling has
continued to trend upward from its midyear trough, and the value of

nonresidential construction put-in-place (which excludes petroleum
drilling) rose 2.8 percent in October to a level 2-1/2 percent above the
third-quarter average. More than one-half of the October gain in construction
was in the small "institutional" grouping (hospitals, religious, and
educational buildings) and may reflect a bunching of outlays in that month.
In part, the recent increase in construction spending in other sectors
may have been prompted by efforts to complete projects before adverse
changes in depreciation provisions take effect at year end.
Based on near-term indicators, investment spending is likely to
remain sluggish into early 1987. New orders for nondefense capital goods
fell 4.8 percent in October; excluding the robust aircraft group, for which
lead times tend to be long, the October decline was 10.6 percent. The
orders series is extremely volatile on a month-to-month basis, but even so,
the October decline suggests some restraint on first-quarter shipments of
equipment. On the construction side, office building activity should
continue to decline, as the decline in outlays to date reflects only
about two-thirds of this year's drop in new commitments. In contrast,
for the other categories of construction, the adjustment of outlays to
earlier declines in commitments has been more rapid, suggesting that
spending outside the office sector may be fairly firm in early 1987.
The first survey readings of planned 1987 capital spending were
released last month. Both the McGraw-Hill and Merrill Lynch surveys indicate
that firms expect nominal outlays to be roughly flat for the second year
in a row. At the industry level, manufacturers generally expect capital
spending to increase a bit while expenditures in other industries--particularly

Business Inventories
Except for fluctuations in auto dealers' stocks, business inventory
investment, on balance, remained moderate through early autumn. In 1982
dollars, nonauto inventories in manufacturing and trade expanded at an
annual rate of $9 billion in September and $10.5 billion over the third
quarter-not materially different from the pace observed during the first
half of this year.
Manufacturers' inventories fell at a $5.2 billion annual rate in real
terms from the end of June to the end of September; book-value data show
another small decline in October. The stock-sales ratio for manufacturing
has remained fairly stable.
In the trade sector, surging auto sales reduced dealers' stocks
at a $50.3 billion annual rate in real terms in September; the rate of
liquidation for the third quarter as a whole was $21.5 billion. The
accumulation of nonauto trade inventories picked up in September, but with
sales fairly robust in that month, the inventory-sales ratios for most types of
nonauto retail and wholesale establishments remained within the ranges observed
over the past year.
Housing Markets
Recent data suggest further slowing of housing construction outlays.
Although total private housing starts were about unchanged between September
and October at 1.65 million units, that pace of construction represents a 5
percent decline from the third-quarter average and is well below the nearly
2.0 million unit rate of the first half of the year.

Multifamily housing starts declined 2 percent in October to
542,000 units, continuing the sharp cutbacks from their first-quarter peak.
Several negative factors continue to contribute to the weakness in this
sector: a record-high 9.4 percent vacancy rate on multifamily rental properties,2
and recent tax code changes that will lower rates of return on investments
in rental properties as well as severely constrain issuance of state and
local government multifamily mortgage revenue bonds.
In recent months single-family starts also have dropped back a bit,
to a 1.1 million unit pace, and new home sales have been disappointing.
The apparent weakness in demand for new homes has been surprising in light
of the return to single-digit conventional mortgage interest rates, the
robust level of existing-home sales, and favorable consumer evaluations
of the housing market.
Housing price appreciation has slowed in recent months. In the existing
home market, the average twelve-month price increase has declined from
double digits in the early summer to 7 percent in October. Prices of new
homes sold rose about 9 percent during the 12 months ending in October,
down considerably from the increases recorded during the summer. However,
more than half of the rise reflected upgrades in housing quality and
changes in the regional mix of sales; new home prices rose only 4 percent
during the year ending in the third quarter.
Regionally, continuing problems in the energy sector have resulted
in some contraction in housing demand in selected markets of the South. The

II-16
average sales price of existing homes in that region showed virtually no
upward movement during the year ending in the third quarter; housing starts
dropped 7 percent during the same period. In the multifamily sector,
reduced demand in the oil-patch states and some other markets, coupled with
previous over-building, have raised the multifamily vacancy rate in the South
to above 10 percent. In the Northeast, by contrast, housing demand has
remained strong; single-family starts this year have been at their highest
level since 1973, and existing home prices have been increasing at
rates far above the national average.
Federal Government
Revised data indicate that real federal purchases rose sharply in
the third quarter, owing entirely to a further increase in defense spending.
Nondefense purchases, excluding the volatile Commodity Credit Corporation
component, continued to drift downward in constant dollars and were about
2-1/4 percent below the level in the third quarter of last year.
During the second and third quarters, real military outlays on an
NIA basis surged at a 16 percent annual rate. This recent strength is
largely a product of the defense authority enacted in recent prior years;
the buildup in obligations has kept real outlays on a sharp uptrend
with the rise over the past year amounting to nearly 7 percent (see chart).
However, quarterly changes continue to be erratic, as a result of the
uneven delivery pattern of various types of large-scale military equipment
that have been in production for several years and now account for a much
larger share of total purchases. For example, acquisitions of B1 bombers
began slowly in 1985 but now are scheduled at 8 to 10 planes per quarter.

Similarly, the Pentagon has just begun receiving new C-5 cargo planes,
while the MX missiles are now at or near their peak delivery rates. In
addition to equipment deliveries, research and development spending has
climbed in spurts, with the level of such spending in the third quarter
15 percent above that recorded a year ago.
Although defense spending probably will not continue to grow at its
recent pace, the level of outlays should remain high at least into the
early part of next year because the backlog of unspent appropriations
remains substantial. However, Congress cut defense budget authority in
fiscal 1986 and again in fiscal 1987, which suggests that real defense
purchases may drift down as time progresses.
With the 1986 session of Congress adjourned and most action on the
FY1987 budget completed, estimates of the 1987 deficit are being reassessed.
Unofficial estimates by OMB Director Miller, which might assume some further
actions to raise certain high-priority spending, have been in the $165 to
$180 billion range, and were made before release of the economic assumptions
earlier this week. Those assumptions show real GNP growth of 3.2 percent during
1987 and 3.7 percent in 1988, significantly less than their previous forecast.
CBO's informal efforts to take account of Congressional action since August
led them to project a deficit of $150 to $160 billion; these assessments
do not incorporate updated economic assumptions or technical re-estimates
of spending rates in light of new legislation. All of these estimates for
the current fiscal year are substantially above the $108 billion target for
FY1988 that must be met, according to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, in the
budget expected to be submitted by the Administration early next year.

State and Local Government
Growth in state and local government spending continued to be
unusually robust during the third quarter. Real purchases of goods and
services increased at an 8 percent annual rate during the past two quarters,
the most rapid gain for any two-quarter period in more than 20 years.1
Most of the strength can be attributed to a sharp jump in real outlays for
construction. In addition to a surge in highway building, state and local
governments have given construction of correctional institutions and
educational facilities a high priority.
The increase in school building largely reflects expanding enrollments
(see chart). The birth rate in the United States turned up in the late
1970s, and the grade school population, which had been declining since
1969, began to grow in 1984. That same year, real outlays by state and
local governments for educational facilities began to increase. The rise
in school building has been considerably more noticeable this year; real
construction put-in-place for this purpose surged at a 61 percent annual
rate during the second and third quarters.
Surpluses in operating and capital accounts in the state and local sector,
excluding social insurance funds, averaged $9.5 billion at an annual rate over
the first three quarters of 1986, about the same as in 1985. However, the
1986 surpluses partly are attributable to temporary inflows. During the
first quarter, payments were transferred to the state and local sector as a
result of penalties paid by Exxon for overcharges during the price control
1. Subsequent revisions to construction put-in-place data for September
suggest the likelihood of some reductions in the growth rate for the third
quarter.

II-22
period. In the second quarter, funds were distributed to the states as
indirect business tax receipts for final settlement of the federal-state
dispute over revenues of outer continental shelf rents. Moreover, in the
third quarter, the surplus was boosted by payments from settlements of
disputes over stripper well charges during the 1970s as well as grants that
were raised due to a shifting of revenue sharing payments from the fourth
quarter. Excluding these special inflows, the surplus during the first
three quarters would have amounted to only $4 billion at an annual rate,
the smallest surplus since a deficit was recorded in 1982. Budgetary
pressure has been uneven in recent months with the greatest erosion in
the oil patch and farm belt states.
Prices
Inflation remained relatively low in October: the consumer price
index for all urban consumers rose 0.2 percent, and the producer price
index for finished goods rose 0.3 percent.
The CPI for food rose 0.3 percent in October, less than in the
preceding three months. In addition, energy prices turned down at both
the retail and refinery levels, despite the firming of crude oil prices
since midsummer. Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose 0.4
percent in October, slightly faster than the average pace during the
first three quarters of the year. The pick up reflected a sharp increase
in new car prices, owing both to higher retail prices for the new 1987
models--which are phased into the CPI sample in proportion to sales--and
to the termination of rebates on 1986 models. The CPI includes automobile
financing costs among services, and the ending of the finance incentive
programs was responsible for most of an October pickup in the index for

nonenergy services. The PPI for new cars rose 4-3/4 percent in October,
much more than the corresponding CPI increase. This rise, along with a
jump in light truck prices, accounted for the 0.7 percent increase in the
index for finished goods less food and energy. In contrast to the CPI,
the PPI includes only new-model cars in its October sample and is based
on manufacturers' revenues, thus reflecting the termination of incentive
financing programs and other discounting by manufacturers as well as the
price increases.
The dollar prices that foreign producers charge for their goods in
the U.S. are beginning to respond to the lower foreign exchange value of
the dollar. According to the BEA index, which measures prices of imports
at their point of entry, prices of non-oil merchandise imports rose 5-1/2
percent from the third quarter of 1985 to the third quarter of 1986,
compared with a 2-3/4 percent decline during the preceding four quarters.
Although the acceleration has been most notable in the machinery and
automobile categories, prices also have picked up considerably for some
other consumer durables, such as photographic equipment.
The influence of the dollar depreciation on the prices of imported
goods at the retail level appears to have been relatively small and
highly variable across sectors, as some distributors or retailers apparently
have been willing to narrow their profit margins. Although the CPI
includes prices of foreign products, the Bureau of Labor Statistics does
not construct separate consumer price indexes for imports and domestically
produced goods. They have, however, indicated those components of the
CPI that, in their view, have a higher-than-average import share. Certain
of these commodities, for example new cars and audio and photographic

equipment, have shown some acceleration in the rate of price increase this
year in comparison with the preceding year. However, little or no ollar-
related effect is evident for many other goods-such as lamps, sporting
goods or toys--where import proportions also are high. A somewhat similar
pattern was observed after the depreciation of the dollar that began in
mid-1976. Dollar prices charged by foreign producers, as represented by
the BEA index for non-oil imports, accelerated during 1977, but much of
the price effect at the final sales level was not seen until 1978.
Wages and Labor Costs
Recent data suggest that, on balance, wage inflation has continued
at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter. The hourly earnings index for
production and nonsupervisory workers was up 0.4 percent in November
after a smaller increase in October. Recent increases in this measure of
wage inflation are somewhat larger than those seen earlier this year, but
much of the rise so far this quarter has occurred in construction, finance,
and services, where the index is quite volatile. In most other industries,
wages changed very little in October and November. Since the beginning
of this year, the hourly earnings index has risen about 2 percent at an
annual rate in the private nonfarm economy, and 1-1/2 percent in
manufacturing.
Revised data on productivity and labor costs showed little change
from the preliminary third-quarter figures. Compensation per hour was up
2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, about the same as
the second quarter's increase. However, productivity growth has remained
quite sluggish in the past two quarters, causing most of the increase in

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have recorded mixed changes over the intermeeting
period, with short-term rates generally up on balance and long-term rates
down somewhat. Money market rates rose early in the period in response to
stronger than expected economic indicators and release of the asymmetric
September FOMC directive; the higher short-term rates persisted, however,
owing in some part to the tendency for federal funds to trade at, or
slightly above, the marginally higher level of 6 percent. Long-term rates
also edged up at first, but subsequently turned downward--apparently
reflecting optimism on inflation trends and the perception that dissatis-
faction with world economic growth might lead to coordinated easing action
by monetary authorities. The rally in the bond markets helped the equity
markets to overcome the Boesky and Iran-Nicaragua shocks; some major
stock price averages hit new highs in early December.
M1 accelerated to around a 20 percent annual rate of growth in
November, but M2 slowed and M3 growth remained moderate; both M2 and M3 are
just inside the upper bounds of their 1986 target ranges. The increase in
M1 growth last month primarily reflected a sharp rebound in demand deposit
growth, while other checkable deposits continued to expand sharply. The
nontransactions component of M2 slowed in November with the deceleration
likely being exaggerated by the transitory influence of a late-October
surge in savings bond sales. Within the nontransactions component, the
story continued to be one of strength in liquid retail deposits and declining
time deposits.
Debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have risen strongly
in November after growth slowed in October. Credit use by nonfinancial

businesses rebounded last month largely on the strength of merger activity.
Residential mortgage growth evidently remained brisk, and the decline in
loan rates to the lowest levels in more than eight years probably has
sustained commitment activity; consumer borrowing likely slowed in November
in the absence of major auto finance incentives. Federal borrowing surged
in November as the Treasury caught up with its huge quarterly deficit
financing needs. In the tax-exempt market, private-purpose borrowing
permitted by the Tax Reform Act picked up, and refinancings were undertaken
to take advantage of lower municipal bond rates.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
In November, demand deposit growth jumped to a 21 percent annual
rate and other checkable deposits (OCDs) rose at about the 31 percent
October pace. Over the past year, OCDs have accounted for more than half
the overall increase in M1 even though they represent less than one-third
of the aggregate. As may be seen in the chart, the runup in OCDs has
occurred against a backdrop of sharply reduced opportunity costs. NOW
account rates have continued to adjust downward only slowly, though not so
slowly as the very sticky passbook savings rate. M1 growth has remained
far in excess of GNP growth, and the velocity decline in the fourth quarter
may be close to the record fall of the second quarter; for the year as a
whole, Ml velocity is expected to be down close to 9 percent--the biggest
drop in recent decades.
M2 grew at only a 7 percent annual rate in November. A shifting of
funds into savings bonds at the end of October-just before the floor rate
was cut from 7-1/2 to 6 percent-probably depressed the average level of M2
in November by a small amount. Retail nontransactions deposits grew at

about the same slow pace as in October, but general purpose and broker/dealer
money fund shares were flat in November after strong gains in each of the
two preceding months. Overnight RPs and Eurodollars weakened in November
as their term counterparts, included in M3, increased strongly--a continua-
tion of the sawtooth pattern of recent months. Preliminary data for November
indicate that offering rates on small time deposits were little changed and
that NOW and savings deposit rates fell a few basis points further.
Growth of M3 remained in the neighborhood of 6 percent for a second
month. Although bank asset growth was fairly rapid, non-M3 liabilities-
especially an inflow of Treasury deposits--covered a good part of funding
needs. At savings and loans, large time deposits continued to run off;
until very recently, thrifts had been relying heavily on RPs and Federal
Home Loan Bank advances to support their asset growth.
Bank credit expanded at a 10 percent annual rate in November, after
rising only 2-1/4 percent in October. A rebound in security loans and
strengthening business loan growth, largely reflecting merger financing,
paced the acceleration; both real estate and consumer lending picked up
some. Purchases of U.S. government securities again ran at over a 20 per-
cent pace. Many of the governments acquired were long term and likely were
federally related mortgage-backed securities; preliminary call report data
show that, in the year ended September 30, more than 80 percent of the
growth in bank holdings of U.S. governments was of this higher-yielding
category. Holdings of other securities continued to decline, probably
reflecting the gradual decumulation of tax-exempt securities obtained
before passage of the Tax Reform Act; the Senior Loan Officer Opinion
survey conducted last month indicated that this runoff can be expected to

go on for a long period of time after the tax deductibility of carrying
costs is sharply curtailed at year-end.
Corporate Finance
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses appears to have increased in
November. Gross offerings of new bonds were somewhat above those of the
preceding two months and loans at commercial banks rose sharply; commercial
paper outstanding declined a bit, however. A major contributing factor in
debt growth was the accelerating pace of mergers, LBOs and share repurchases
in advance of year-end changes in the tax laws.
Corporate securities markets were affected last month by the announce-
ment of the SEC settlement with Ivan Boesky and the continuation of the SEC
investigation into insider trading. Although the financing for some trans-
actions was put in doubt, announcements of new deals were numerous, ensuring
a large volume of share retirements in December. Secondary market trading
in "junk bonds" was markedly affected by news of the subpoenas issued to
Drexel Burnham Lambert executives. Bid-asked spreads on low-grade and
unrated debt widened sharply, to roughly double their recent size for large,
well-known firms in healthy industries; yields on low-grade bonds rose 50
to 100 basis points relative to Treasuries and higher-rated corporates;
issues of smaller firms reportedly fared even worse. Investment grade
bonds, however, were not much affected and yields dropped to near the
spring lows-about in line with declines in long-term Treasury yields.
Stock prices-particularly those of takeover targets, securities
dealers, and financial institutions with heavy investments in low-grade
bonds-initially fell sharply after the SEC investigation became public.
Markets rallied, however, as news of further revelations tapered off;

some broad stock indexes are currently above their levels at the time of
the last FOMC meeting. Trading volume has risen in the past few weeks, but
it is impossible to tell how much may be associated with realizations of
long-term capital gains in advance of the tax law changes. New issue
volume for equity was quite high in November, and included the largest
initial public offering ever by a nonfinancial corporation-a $1.2 billion
issue for the newly formed Coca Cola Enterprises, comprising the bulk of
all Coca Cola bottling operations. Part of this issue was sold abroad as a
"Euroequity." Issuance in the Euroequity market by financial and nonfinancial
corporations has grown to about $1.5 billion so far this year as foreign
investors evince increasing interest in U.S. equity securities.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The combined deficit of the federal government is expected to total
$66-1/2 billion in the current quarter. This deficit, although still quite
sizable, has been held down by restraint in the FY1987 appropriations bills
and to a slight extent by a concentration of tax receipts early in this
fiscal year associated with the Tax Reform Act.1 The distribution of
additional corporate and personal tax payments between the current quarter
and early in calendar year 1987 is quite uncertain, however.
The Treasury is expected to finance this quarter's deficit by borrowing
$67 billion, net, from the public. Factors other than the deficit will
1. Although the Tax Reform Act was designed to be revenue neutral over a
five-year period, a revenue gain is expected to be realized in FY1987 as
reductions in individual taxes are smaller than the increase in corporate
taxes. A large share of this tax gain will occur in the first half of the
fiscal year as firms meet their added liabilities associated with the retro-
active repeal of the investment tax credit. Individual tax payments also
could be large in late 1986 and early 1987 if the tax reform provisions
induce investors to realize capital gains by year-end 1986 before the tax
rate on this source of income increases.

absorb funds during the quarter, and the Treasury will reduce its cash
balance slightly. It will raise $16 billion, one-fourth of total borrowing,
through the issuance of bills. This is the second consecutive quarter of
unusually heavy borrowing in the bill market, representing, in part, a
catchup from previous reduced offerings in the wake of debt ceiling con-
straints as well as reduced funding needs because of inflows from non-
marketable debt. Issuance of nonmarketable debt likely will be strong
again in the fourth quarter; net SLG volume jumped to $3-1/4 billion in
November, when state and local government advance refundings were again
large, and it should remain heavy in December.
There was a rush to buy savings bonds before November 1 but, because
of lags in remitting the funds to the Treasury, most of the proceeds will
be recorded in data for November, or even December. Under the circum-
stances, the actual volume sold in October cannot be precisely determined,
but it appears that the extra sales might have been around $2 billion to $3
billion.
Net borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies is expected
to slow sharply in the current quarter. Throughout the first three quarters
of the year, it was boosted by Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing as the
demand of thrift institutions for advances was strong. Recently, the
demand for advances has moderated, and net borrowing by the FHLBs should
be negligible in the fourth quarter. Borrowing by Fannie Mae, which
increased in October, fell back in November; the demand for funds by Fannie
Mae has been restrained throughout the year by mortgage prepayments and
loan sales. The Farm Credit Banks should again pay down a relatively large
amount of debt in the fourth quarter; in the third quarter there was only a

III-12
small net repayment as the FCS issued large amounts of short-term securities
to build their cash position.
State and Local Government Securities Market
The volume of tax-exempt bond offerings rose appreciably in November
after the passage of the Tax Reform Act. Evidently, many states have now
allocated bond authority to potential issuers under the new state-by-state
volume restrictions for private-purpose bonds; a number of housing and
industrial development bonds have been sold. Refunding volume matched
the strong October pace as tax-exempt bond yields fell to 7-1/2 year lows.
In the short-term area, issuance rose considerably in November as Texas
came to the market for the first time ever, with a $600 million offering
to help the state manage a cash shortfall associated with a nearly $1 billion
budget deficit this year.
The expansion of the taxable municipal market was interrupted in
November. Through October, around $3-1/2 billion in taxable municipal
securities were sold, mostly for the support of private activities--primarily
housing, agriculture, and development--that is restricted under tax reform.
Proceeds from about half the bonds have been invested in guaranteed invest-
ment contracts (GICs) with Executive Life Insurance Company until the money
is lent to qualified borrowers for commercial, industrial, and agricultural
projects; Executive has been able to offer high yields on the GICs by in-
vesting in low-rated corporate bonds. These arrangements have come under
heavy criticism from other market participants in recent months because of
the apparent intent of earning arbitrage profits for the issuers and because
of the large fees for the underwriters and lawyers. Most taxable municipal

III-13
bonds backed by GICs initially have traded at around 130 to 150 basis points
over 10-year Treasury rates. However, in the wake of the Boesky-Drexel news,
yields rose in the secondary market to as much as 190 basis points above
Treasuries, and several proposed deals were postponed until market uncertain-
ties dissipate.

Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on home mortgage commitments have eased significantly
since the last FOMC meeting. The average contract rate for new commitments
on conventional fixed-rate mortgages at a sample of S&Ls had fallen nearly
60 basis points by the week ending December 5 to 9.30 percent, the lowest
level in 8-1/2 years. The drop in market rates prompted the Veterans
Administration to lower its maximum contract rate by 50 basis points to 9
percent, effective November 24. The pace of mortgage refinancings has not
yet slowed; in October, 37 percent of FHA-insured commitments made on
existing homes were for refinancing purposes, while nearly half of all VA
mortgage closings were refinancings. Even so, the markets appear to be

dealing with prepayment risk more realistically, and rate premiums on
mortgages and mortgage-backed securities have narrowed a bit since late
summer.
Growth in residential mortgage debt surged in the third quarter to
the most robust pace in seven years. This pickup reflected a continued
increase in sales of existing homes during the summer, which more than
offset moderating sales of new homes. An easing of mortgage processing
bottlenecks also may have helped fuel the growth. In contrast, lending on
nonresidential properties remained noticeably below the recent peak rate,
consistent with the slowing in office construction and the depressed agri-
cultural economy. The funding trends observed earlier in the year continued
in the third quarter: mortgage pools were the vehicle for the bulk of
overall, and especially home, mortgage debt formation; federal and related
agencies as a group were net sellers of mortgages; and thrift institutions
shied away from investment in mortgages. Including holdings of mortgage-
backed securities, however, thrifts accounted for about one-fifth of net
funding.
This hesitancy by thrifts to add loans to their portfolios has not
detracted from their participation in the mortgage lending boom. To the
contrary, FSLIC-insured institutions originated $26.2 billion in net loans
during October, up 10 percent from the previously unparalleled third-quarter
clip.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit expanded at a 14 percent annual rate in
October, down from September but still above the third-quarter pace. The
relative strength in September-October mainly reflected a surge in auto

credit in response to the auto incentive programs. The nonauto components
accelerated in October, however, breaking the trend that has been evident
for most of this year.
The general slowdown in nonauto credit growth has been particularly
striking for the revolving credit component. Revolving credit growth may
be responding in part to the stubbornly high interest rates on credit card
receivables, which remained at an average of over 18 percent at banks in
early November, and to heavy promotion of credit lines secured by home
equity--a lower-cost alternative. Although no comprehensive data exist on
the volume of lending under such arrangements, reports of their promotion-
often at sharply reduced introductory rates--have been widespread; in some
areas lenders also are waiving part, or all, of the closing costs, thus
removing a formidable barrier to the substitution of a home equity line for
comparatively small credit card accounts. Further, lenders themselves may
have begun to curtail growth in revolving credit directly by closing or
otherwise restricting the use of delinquent credit card accounts, which
have climbed sharply over the past two years to reach record levels. In
contrast, delinquencies on a mixture of closed-end loans at banks are
little changed, on balance, from two years ago. Delinquencies on home
mortgages have edged lower but remain high.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The foreign-exchange value of the dollar, measured against a
weighted average of foreign G-10 currencies, has declined on balance
about 1-1/2 percent since the November 5 FOMC meeting. (See Chart 1.)
When valued against individual currencies, the dollar's movements have
been uneven. Among the major currencies, the dollar has fallen against
the mark about 2 percent and against the yen about 3/4 percent. The
dollar has gained about 1/4 percent against the pound.
The erratic but generally downward trend of the dollar during the
intermeeting period -- particularly against the mark -- seemed to arise
primarily from market reaction to new data that suggested weaker
prospects for the U.S. economy and from anticipation that credit
policies in Germany might be tightened in view of recent rapid German
money growth. The dollar also seemed to be weakened occasionally by
developments in the controversy over shipment of U.S. arms to Iran. The
dollar's downward movement reversed temporarily in mid-November
following statements by U.S. and foreign officals that, against the
background of the Baker-Miyazawa agreement at the end of October,
suggested that authorities were satisfied with the present configuration
of exchange rates, but the dollar resumed its earlier decline in the
second half of November. In the first week of December, the dollar
retraced some of its previously lost ground -- primarily against the
mark -- following release of new German data, including third-quarter
GNP figures, that suggested somewhat softer growth in Germany than had
been expected.

Norwegian authorities raised overnight
interest rates in early December by 2 percentage points to support the
krone, which came under strong selling pressure owing to deterioration
in the external outlook for Norway and budget problems.
.In
late November and early December, downward pressure on the French franc
against the mark was exacerbated by political protests in France,
The average differential between short-term dollar and foreign
interest rates remained about unchanged during the intermeeting period,
as both U.S. rates and foreign rates on average rose slightly. Interest
rate increases in some foreign countries, including the Netherlands,
France, and Italy, were greater, however, as their currencies
experienced intermittent pressure within the EMS. In early November,
Dutch authorities raised the interest rate on 7-day advances by about 10
basis points following smaller increases in German short-term rates that
gave rise to selling pressure on the guilder. On December 8, French
authorities raised their 7-day repurchase rate by 100 basis points to
8-1/2 percent in response to increases in German interest rates. Most
long-term interest differentials moved against the dollar during the

IV-4
intermeeting period, as U.S. long-term interest rates fell by roughly 25
basis points, while foreign long-term interest rates presented a mixed
picture of smaller movements.

IV-5
U.S. International Financial Transactions
The growth of official reserve assets in the United States continued
in September, bringing the increase in the first three quarters of the
year to almost $32 billion. (See line 4 of the Summary Table on U.S.
International Transactions.) Contributing to the recorded increase in
September was the investment by the United Kingdom of part of the proceeds
of its $4 billion Eurobond issue and probably the accumulation of interest
earnings on the dollar reserve holdings of certain G-10 countries and
Switzerland. The official reserve holdings of Taiwan and other newly
industrializing countries also continued to increase in September.
Partial information from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates
that official reserve holdings of the G-10 countries rose further in
October. A large portion of this increase, however, includes a swap
operation, undertaken by the Bundesbank to provide liquidity to West
Germany's domestic markets, that was reversed in early November.
As a result of large official purchases, foreign holdings of U.S.
Treasury securities have increased dramatically this year. In contrast to
1985, when net acquisitions of Treasuries by both official and
non-official foreign investors were less than $20 billion, in the first
three quarters of 1986 alone, net purchases were $40 billion,
three-quarters by foreign official institutions. Foreign private net
purchases of U.S. Treasury securities (line 3) increased sharply in
September. Reported holdings of Japanese residents rose by $4 billion, in
contrast to net purchases of only $1 billion in the first eight months of
the year. About one-third of the September net purchases by Japanese
residents was made through the U.S. offices of Japanese-based securities
firms; most of the transactions of Japanese residents in the U.S. Treasury

securities market in 1986 (as in previous years) have been with U.S.-based
dealers. In light of these facts, caution should be used in interpreting
the reported activity of Japanese-based securities dealers in U.S.
Treasury auctions as indicative of shifts in Japanese residents'
preferences for dollar securities in general or Treasury securities in
particular.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds and stocks
(lines 2a and 2b) continued to generate large capital inflows, totaling
over $17 billion for the third quarter and almost $6 billion in September.
Partly offsetting September's inflow was an increase in U.S. net purchases
of foreign securities (line 2c), although for the quarter as a whole net
transactions in foreign securities were negligible. Preliminary data show
some drop off in the capital inflows associated with private securities
transactions in the fourth quarter. U.S. corporations' Eurobond offerings
in October and November fell below September's level. In addition,
foreign bond offerings in the United States rose in October, largely due
to two World Bank issues. November's foreign bond offerings seem to have
dropped somewhat from October's, but partial data on the first week of
December show nearly $2 billion in foreign bond offerings in the United
States. The issues include a $0.5 billion junk bond of an Australian
firm, underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and a number of smaller
bonds and notes of the World Bank and several governments (New Zealand,
Finland, and Denmark).
Banks reported a small net outflow in September. (See line 1 of the
Summary Table.) For the third quarter as a whole almost two-thirds of the

-IV-8
reported inflow reflects a reporting change (discussed in previous
greenbooks), and not actual inflows during this time period. The rest of
the reported inflow was spread over a variety of categories: increased
liabilities to private foreign nonbanks, including the World Bank, reduced
claims on nonbank foreigners, particularly in the form of bankers'
acceptances, as well as some net increase in liabilities to unaffiliated
foreign banks. Partial information for November, shown on line 3 of the
International Banking Data Table, indicates substantial inflows into banks
from their own foreign offices and IBFs; these inflows occurred during a
period when U.S. bank credit growth accelerated sharply.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In October, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was the
smallest in recent months. These preliminary data are subject to
possibly large revisions. On a seasonally-adjusted basis, exports are
estimated to have risen moderately in October. Most of the rise
appears to be increased shipments of soybeans, largely to Japan; the
level of nonagricultural exports in October was about the same as in
the preceding six months on average. Imports are estimated to have
declined in October. The volume of oil imports dropped from roughly 8

million barrels per day in September to about 6-1/2 million barrels per
day in October; this drop in volume was only partly offset by a rise in
price of about 70 cents per barrel. The estimated decline in nonoil
imports was largely in capital goods, especially business machines,
construction equipment and aircraft.
In the third quarter, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit is
estimated to have been $150 billion at an annual rate on a
balance-of-payments basis; this is similar to the rate of deficit
recorded in the previous three quarters (column 7 in the table above).
The Commerce Department will release revised third-quarter data on
December 10; these data will be included in the Greenbook supplement.
While the value of exports in the third quarter is estimated to
be about the same as in the second quarter, it appears that the volume
exported turned up moderately (by 2 percent). Over the past four
quarters, the volume of exports rose by about 9-1/2 percent on a
balance-of-payments basis and by 5-1/2 percent on a GNP basis. (Gold
exports are not included in GNP; substantial gold shipments to Japan
during the past two quarters account for much of the difference in export
growth rates.) Agricultural commodities account for only a small part of
the increase in exports over the past year. The increase in
nonagricultural exports has been fairly slow in recent quarters;
nontheless, the level reached in 1986-Q3 was the highest in five years.
Export prices (fixed-weight) declined in the third quarter at
a 5-1/2 percent annual rate, with most of the decline in the prices of
agricultural commodities and industrial supplies.

IV-12
Both the value and volume of nonoil imports in 1986-Q3 are
estimated to have increased moderately from the second-quarter level.
Increases in some categories, such as foreign cars, business machines,
apparel, footwear and paper were nearly offset by declines in other areas.
The rate of nonoil import expansion appears to be slowing; of the 13
percent rise in volume during the past year (BOP basis), only 3 percent
occurred in the last two quarters.
Prices of nonoil imports (fixed-weight) rose at a 4-1/2 percent
rate in the third quarter, somewhat less than the 6-1/2 percent rate
recorded in the first two quarters. Declines in prices of food imports
offset some of the price rises recorded by various manufactured goods
imports. The price of imported nonoil industrial supplies edged up in the
third quarter after having declined for the preceding 8 quarters. (See the
discussion of import prices in Section II of the Greenbook.)
The value of oil imports was about the same in the third quarter
as in the second quarter. A strong rise in volume was offset by a sharp
decline in price. Much of the increase in volume appears to have gone
into inventories. While OPEC agreed to continue production restraints
through December, the desire of Saudi Arabian authorities to raise both
their oil production rate and the price of oil has heightened uncertainty
in world oil markets.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent data on real GNP/GDP growth provide mixed evidence on the
strength of economic activity in the major foreign industrial economies.
Real GNP increased by 2.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in Japan and rose by 2.9
percent in Germany. Real GDP was up by an estimated 4 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the United Kingdom, but increased at only a 1.2 perdent
rate in Canada, and fell at a 3.2 percent rate in Italy.
Inflation rates for consumer prices have shown little change over
recent months, remaining at generally low levels. Wholesale prices
declined further in Japan and Germany, as they have in nearly every
month over the past year, and in Italy and France wholesale prices
continued to be below year-earlier levels.
The Japanese trade surplus has narrowed slightly in recent months,
but this year's cumulative trade and current account surpluses have
continued at record high levels in Japan, as in Germany.
Individual Country Notes. Real GNP in Japan grew 2.6 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, slowing from 3.8 percent in the
previous quarter. Private consumption and residential investment
continued to make strong contributions to growth, while plant and
equipment investment remained sluggish. Net exports were the principal
source of weakness. Calculations of changes in domestic demand and net
exports were influenced by the unusual gold purchases in the second
quarter. Total domestic demand excluding gold grew faster in the third
quarter than in the previous quarter--8.7 percent versus 3.6 percent.
Net exports excluding gold made a substantial negative contribution to

real growth in the third quarter but a small positive contribution in
the second quarter.
Japanese industrial production fell 1.9 percent (s.a.) in October
after declining 0.5 percent in the third quarter. The Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) believes that industrial
production dropped 0.3 percent in November, but should rebound about 3
percent in December. If MITI's provisional estimates are realized,
industrial production in 1986 will be roughly unchanged from its level
last year.
Other signs of weakness in the Japanese economy include a fall in
the August index of leading indicators to 41.7 percent after two months
at the 50 percent "boom-bust" demarcation line, and a decline of 9.7
percent (s.a.) in domestic private sector orders for new machinery in
the third quarter. The residential and consumer sectors are likely to
remain the principal sources of strength in the economy in the fourth
quarter. Retail sales rose 2.1 percent (s.a.) in October, after a 0.5
percent increase in the third quarter.
Japanese inflation remains low. For the three months ending in
November, the Tokyo index of consumer prices was 0.3 percent above its
year-earlier level, and wholesale prices in the three months ending in
October were 11.4 percent below their level in the year-earlier period.
Japan's trade surplus, measured in U.S. dollars, narrowed in
September and October before increasing in November. For the first 11
months of 1986 the cumulative trade surplus was a record $82 billion
(s.a.a.r.), the same rate as the cumulative current account surplus
through October. In October, export volume fell 1.7 percent (s.a.)

IV-18
after a 0.2 percent rise in the third quarter, and import volume rose 5
percent following a 0.5 percent decline in the third quarter. Purchases
of non-monetary gold for a probable minting next year of additional
commemorative coins added to October imports.
The Tax Council of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has approved
a tax reform package that calls for a 2.65 trillion yen ($16.4 billion)
reduction in individual income taxes and a 1.8 trillion yen ($11.1
billion) reduction in corporate taxes. These tax reductions would be
balanced by the introduction of a value-added tax and the abolition of
tax breaks for small savers. The LDP will recommend that the tax cuts
exceed the tax increases in FY 1987/88 (beginning April 1), but that the
package should be revenue neutral over the next two fiscal years.
Officials of the Ministry of Finance are expected to resist the LDP's
recommendation that tax reductions exceed tax increases in the coming
fiscal year.
In Germany, preliminary third-quarter real GNP data released by the
Bundesbank show a growth rate of 2.9 percent (s.a.a.r.). Due to a
slowdown in inventory accumulation, total domestic demand grew at only a
0.5 percent rate. Net exports made a positive contribution to growth as
imports fell sharply from their unusually high second-quarter level.
Industrial production fell 0.1 percent (s.a.) in October from a
September level that was revised upward by 0.8 percent. (The October
figure is also expected to be revised upward.) The higher September
number put third-quarter industrial production 0.7 percent above its
second-quarter level. The rate of unemployment continued its gradual
decline, reaching 8.6 percent (s.a.) in November.

IV-19
The cost of living index remained unchanged (n.s.a.) in November
and was 1 percent below its year-ago level. Wholesale prices fell 0.6
percent (n.s.a.) in November and were down 9.1 percent compared with a
year earlier. Import prices, after falling 2 percent (n.s.a.) in
October, showed a 21 percent decline over the previous 12 months.
The trade surplus was $5.3 billion (n.s.a.) in October, and $50
billion (a.r.) for January through October, compared with $24 billion in
the same period last year. The current account surplus in October was
$4 billion (n.s.a.). Cumulated through October, the current account
surplus was $33 billion (a.r.), up from $11 billion in the same period
last year.
The Budget Committee of the Bundestag has approved a draft federal
budget for 1987. It calls for expenditure growth of 1.9 percent, less
than the 2.9 percent increase proposed by the government in July. The
proposed federal budget deficit for 1987 was reduced by DM 2 billion
from the originally planned DM 24.3 billion. (The 1986 deficit is now
estimated at DM 23.7 billion.) The Committee's proposals included an
extension of the general spending limits imposed this summer into 1987,
and cuts in unemployment compensation and defense spending.
In the other G-7 foreign industrial countries, the pace of activity
appears to have increased recently in the United Kingdom, while
remaining sluggish in France and Canada and turning negative in Italy.
In the United Kingdom, consumption appears to have been the main source
of recent strength, with the volume of retail sales in October 7 percent
above its year-earlier level. U.K. unemployment declined (s.a.) for the
second consecutive month in October. Industrial production in France

IV-20
rose by 2.2 percent (s.a.) in the third quarter, while unemployment
remained at a near-record high 10.6 percent. Despite slower growth in
Canada, the unemployment rate declined for the third straight month to
8.4 percent (s.a.) in October, its lowest level in over four years.
Twelve-month consumer price inflation rates remained relatively
stable in October in Canada, the United Kingdom, and France. Italian
consumer price inflation has continued to decline, dropping to 4.7
percent in November, compared with 8 percent at the beginning of the
year.
The trade deficits in both France and Italy have remained well
below levels of last year through the first ten months of this year, in
large part reflecting lower oil import costs. In the United Kingdom, in
contrast, lower oil export earnings have contributed to a substantial
widening of the cumulative trade deficit through October of this year.
In Canada, the cumulative trade surplus through September was less than
half that of last year.
In recent policy initiatives, the French government announced its
monetary targets for 1987. The new M3 target was unchanged from this
year's 3 and 5 percent. A target for M2 was also set calling for growth
between 4 and 6 percent. (Through September, actual M3 growth this year
has been 4.8 percent (s.a.a.r.), and M2 growth has been 5.9 percent.)
In addition, the government announced that monetary policy procedures
would be changed starting in January, with quantitative credit ceilings
eliminated and increasing reliance being placed on an open market
intervention policy. The government initiated its privatization program
by selling shares in Saint Gobain, the first of 69 companies scheduled

IV-21
to be denationalized over the next five years. An additional easing of
foreign exchange and price controls was also announced.
The government of the United Kingdom, in its Autumn Statement on
fiscal policy, revealed higher spending plans-total government
expenditure is now projected to increase by 2 percent in real terms
between the current and next fiscal years. Despite higher planned
spending, the government reconfirmed its goal of keeping the public
sector deficit from rising above its current level of about 2 percent of
GDP.

IV-22
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Commitments to the commercial bank financing package for Mexico
reached 90 percent of the $7.7 billion sought on November 19, triggering
the release of more than $1-1/4 billion from the IMF, the World Bank,
and the participants in the bridge loans from the commercial banks and
official sources. Brazil's overheated economy has created serious
difficulties for the anti-inflation objectives of the Cruzado Plan and
for Brazil's external accounts, prompting the government to take
measures to slow the growth of domestic demand. Venezuela has devalued
by 48 percent the exchange rate used for most imports in an effort to
reduce the government deficit and slow the loss of exchange reserves.
Real GDP growth in Argentina in the first three quarters of 1986 has
been strong; the inflation rate remains well above the government's
desired range. Chile has opened negotiations with its creditor banks on
its 1987-88 financing needs. Peru has held preliminary discussions with
its creditor banks on a scheme to repay some of its external debts in
goods rather than cash. The Philippine negotiations with creditor banks
to restructure external debts due in 1987-91 broke down in November, but
resumption of the talks is being explored.
Individual Country Notes. Commitments to the commercial bank
financing package for Mexico reached 90 percent of the $7.7 billion
sought on November 19. With this, the World Bank released the first
$300 million tranche of its sectoral adjustment loan to Mexico linked to
trade policy reform approved last July, and the IMF Executive Board gave
final approval to the SDR 1.4 billion stand-by arrangement negotiated
with Mexico last summer. The IMF action allowed Mexico not only to make

IV-23
the first drawing of SDR 225 million on this credit but also to gain
access to the $750 million balance--$250 million from official sources
and $500 million from commercial banks--of the $1.6 billion bridge loan
arranged last August. In addition, a $1 billion credit from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan was signed in early December.
The 1987 public sector budget, submitted to the Mexican Congress in
late November, calls for an overall deficit of 13.8 percent of GDP, 3
percentage points less than in 1986. Most of the decline is expected
from increases in public sector prices and a tax reform, which will
limit the corporate income tax deduction for interest payments to the
real rather than the nominal payments, but will also reduce income tax
rates and liberalize depreciation provisions. A 15 percent increase in
public sector investment expenditures in real terms is planned, but
other public spending is to be contained enough to achieve a small
reduction in the ratio of total public sector expenditures to GDP.
The government is forecasting a real GDP growth of 2-3 percent in
1987, compared with a 4 percent decline in 1986, and a reduction in the
inflation rate to the 70-80 percent range from 100-105 percent this year.
The CPI rose by 5.7 percent in October and by 6.8 percent in November.
The peso price of the dollar rose by 7.2 percent in October and by 7
percent in November. The spread between the free and controlled
exchange rates has narrowed to about 1 percent.
In Brazil, the Cruzado Plan has run into serious difficulties
mostly related to booming consumer demand. Real GDP growth may be as
much as 9 percent this year. The trade surplus plunged to $840 million
in September and $210 million in October from an average of $1.2 billion

IV-24
a month in September-October 1985 and about $1 billion a month for the
first eight months of 1986, in part perhaps because of uncertainties
surrounding the viability of the official exchange rate, but also
because of strong internal demand. Cash foreign exchange reserves,
which were about $7.3 billion in June 1986, are rumored to be $4-5
billion currently.
Less than a week after the November 15 elections, which resulted in
a large victory for President Sarney's party, the government took steps
to moderate the growth of domestic demand and improve the external
accounts. Excise taxes on cars, fuel, electricity and other items were
increased sharply, a move estimated to generate additional revenues
of at least 3-1/2 percent of 1986 GDP and to slow 1987 GDP growth
significantly. A more flexible exchange rate policy was introduced and
mini-devaluations at about a 4 percent monthly rate have subsequently
been implemented. Other measures involved changes in wage policy,
further deindexation of financial assets, and public sector admini-
strative reforms. In the wake of the announcements, interest rates have
soared, the stock market has fallen, and the spread between the official
and parallel exchange rates has remained roughly unchanged at about 100
percent. The measures will partly reverse the large real wage gains
obtained by most workers during 1985-86. In protest, the unions have
called for a general strike on December 12.
The IMF Executive Board reviewed Brazilian economic developments
and prospects on December 10 in connection with the annual Article IV
consultation. Brazil has been hoping that a positive assessment by the
IMF will lead to a Paris Club rescheduling, even though Brazil will not

IV-25
have a formal IMF program, and that a positive IMF assessment and a
Paris Club agreement will lead to a multi-year commercial bank
rescheduling in early 1987.
Only two weeks after Venezuela's President Lusinchi said that a
devaluation was not contemplated, he announced, late on December 5, a
devaluation from Bs. 7.50 to Bs. 14.50 per dollar for most imports. The
new rate will also apply to luxury imports and private sector exports,
for which the free market rate, recently about Bs. 24 per dollar, had
been used. To deal with the impact of the exchange rate change, the
government announced a continuation of the freeze on prices of a
selected list of consumer goods and compensatory wage adjustments,
including a 25 percent increase in the minimum wage. Since proceeds
from exports of oil and other products of state enterprises represent
over 90 percent of total exports, government receipts from net sales of
foreign exchange to private importers will rise substantially.
Venezuela has begun making the $750 million downpayment due under
the terms of its public sector debt rescheduling, and is expected to
complete the downpayment by year-end. Progress is also being made on
private sector debt negotiations: the government has agreed to proceed
with a scheme involving voluntary warrants by which debtors could lock
in an exchange rate for a premium. The banks have indicated that the
public sector downpayment and the private sector debt negotiations must
be completed before they will respond to the Venezuelan request to
soften the terms of last February's public sector rescheduling.
For the first three quarters of 1986, real GDP growth in Argentina
has averaged 5 percent on an annual basis. Inflation as measured by the

IV-26
CPI has been slowing from the peak monthly rate of 8.8 percent in
August, but remains far above the 2.5 to 3 percent range envisioned by
policymakers in late August. The CPI rose by 6.1 percent in October and
by 5.3 percent in November. On November 28, President Alfonsin took
steps to improve control over 13 major state enterprises, adjusted
salary scales to attract and retain qualified senior managers in state
enterprises, and instituted an early retirement program to reduce public
sector employment. Negotiations with the IMF on a stand-by arrangement
and a Compensatory Financing Facility drawing are continuing.
Negotiations with banks began this week on a temporary rollover of
maturities pending completion of discussions with the IMF.
Chile has opened negotiations with its creditor banks on its
1987-88 financing needs. Chile is projecting a financing gap of about
$650 million for that period and has proposed (a) reducing the spread on
its rescheduled bank debt, (b) switching from semi-annual to annual
interest payments, and (c) obtaining a Paris Club rescheduling.
However, several key banks rejected the second element of the proposal,
and Chile may have to seek new money in place of it. On November 20,
the World Bank approved a $250 million Structural Adjustment Loan, the
second such loan to Chile in the past two years. The United States and
several other countries abstained in the voting on the loan to protest
Chilean abuses of human rights.
In November, Peru held preliminary discussions with foreign banks
on a scheme to repay some of its external debts in goods rather than
cash. The government projects a trade surplus of only $210 million this
year, compared with $1.1 billion in 1985, due to lower export prices and

IV-27
to a rising volume of imports that reflects growth in economic activity.
In the first nine months of 1986, real GDP was about 7 percent higher
than in the same period of 1985. In early December, the government
carried out a "de-facto" depreciation by shifting many imports from the
official exchange rate to the "financial" rate, which is 25 percent
higher, and enlarging exporters' access to the financial rate. Starting
next month, both rates will be depreciated by 2.2 percent per month.
The Philippine negotiations with creditor banks to restructure $3.6
billion in external debt due in 1987-91 that began on October 27 broke
down on November 7. The Philippines hoped to obtain a 20-year term, as
Mexico recently did, and a 5/8 percent spread (less than Mexico's 13/16
percent). But, the bank advisory committee offered a 16-year term with
a spread of 1-3/8 percent. Negotiations were suspended when one of the
creditor banks refused to improve on these conditions. On December 11,
the bank advisory committee met to explore ways to resume the talks.
