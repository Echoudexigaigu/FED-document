The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic production appears to have expanded moderately in the
fourth quarter--a bit more strongly than the preliminary GNP release
suggested, given the recent data on the trade balance. Industrial
activity, in particular, improved noticeably last quarter. Although
the prices of a number of commodities, including oil, have posted
appreciable increases in recent months, wage and price increases more
generally have remained on a fairly steady course.
Employment and Unemployment
Growth in labor demand appears to have been well-maintained
toward year-end. Preliminary data indicate that nonfarm payroll employment
rose 270,000 in December, and the average monthly gain for the fourth
quarter (258,000) was substantially above the average for the year
(202,000). More than half of December's job growth took place in
service industries, particularly business and health services, a leading
source of new jobs throughout the current cyclical expansion. In
contrast, employment in retail trade was essentially unchanged in
December, reflecting less-than-usual holiday hiring in general
merchandising stores. In manufacturing, employment advanced for a third
consecutive month, with increases occurring in durable and nondurable
goods industries. Initial claims for unemployment insurance, which
moved down a notch last fall, remained at a reduced level
through the first three weeks of January.

Over the year, total payroll employment grew 2.4 million, only a
bit less than 1985. The services industry accounted for more than 1
million of the total, and retail trade added nearly 600,000, especially
in eating and drinking establishments. The finance, insurance, and real
estate industry also expanded rapidly (370,000 workers), in part an
outgrowth of the demand for new and refinanced home mortgages that was
fueled by lower interest rates.
In contrast, the number of jobs in the goods-producing sector was
largely unchanged in 1986, as over-the-year losses in mining and
manufacturing were offset by a pickup in construction jobs. Plummeting
oil prices reduced employment in the oil and gas extraction industry by
25 percent last year. In manufacturing, losses in the durable goods
sector were concentrated in machinery industries, while small, but widespread,
gains characterized the nondurable goods sector.
As measured by the household survey, the civilian unemployment
rate fell in December to 6.7 percent, from 6.9 percent in November.1
Over the year, the unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage point. Unemployment
rate declines were most prominent for adult women in 1986, while the rate
for adult males was unchanged.
Industrial Output and Capacity Utilization
After showing little net change over the first 3 quarters of the year,
industrial production rose at an annual rate of about 3-1/4 percent in the
final quarter.
1. The December household survey reflected annual revisions to the
seasonally adjusted labor force series to incorporate the experience of
1986. As a result of these revisions, November's estimated unemployment
rate was revised down 0.1 percentage point, to 6.9 percent.

The pickup in production growth in the fourth quarter reflected, in
part, an improved performance in several industries in which output had
been sluggish earlier in the year--for example, iron and steel, textiles
and apparel, and fabricated metals. These industries had been hard-hit
by foreign competition in recent years, and the recent data, while not
conclusive evidence of a turnabout, do point in the direction of some
improvement in competitiveness.
Another factor in the fourth-quarter production rise was the continued
strong showing of industries that have performed well throughout the year,
such as the aerospace business, and industries that have benefited from
the growth in consumer spending in the past year-appliances and television,
paper, and rubber and plastics. The mining industry, which suffered
earlier in the year, appears to have stabilized in the fourth quarter
as a result of firming oil prices.
Two important sectors--business equipment and motor vehicles and
parts--did not share in the improved production performance toward year-end.
Business equipment output grew only 1 percent at an annual rate last quarter,
when production of manufacturing, power, construction, mining, and farm
equipment all fell sharply. Production in the motor vehicles and parts
industry fluctuated during 1986, but was essentially unchanged from
production a year earlier. Despite favorable domestic demand for cars,
the automotive industry assembled only 7.8 million units last year,
compared to 8.2 million in 1985.
Recent price developments also provide some evidence of a firming in
the industrial sector. In particular, the prices of industrial commodities,
which tend to be sensitive to changes in activity, were weak through most of

II-7
1986. However, according to several measures these prices turned up in
the fourth quarter and increased further in January. The rise in
prices late last year was concentrated in a few markets and partly
reflected some special factors, but the increases early this year have
been a bit more widespread.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities
rose to 79.6 percent in December, from 79.4 percent in November.
However, year-end capacity utilization remained below the 80.6 percent
recorded in December of 1985, as the slight increase in industrial
production was outpaced by an estimated 2.1 percent increase in industrial
capacity.
In nondurable manufacturing, the steady increase in production
over the year lifted the average operating rate to 85.2 percent in
December, up from 83 5 percent a year earlier, but still 2 percentage
points short of the monthly high recorded in 1978. In contrast, durable
manufacturing and mining producers saw utilization rates slide again
last year, resulting in layoffs and some plant closings, particularly
in metal mining, oil and gas extraction, and the machinery and trans-
portation equipment industries.
Personal Income and Consumption
The growth of nominal personal income, which had been particularly
sluggish in the third quarter, perked up a little, to a 4 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, owing to a boost from two special factors--
bonus payments to auto workers in October and subsidy payments to
farmers in December. Nonetheless, nominal income growth in the second

half of the year was only half as fast as in the two previous quarters,
reflecting slow growth in rental income, and declines in proprietors'
income and personal interest income. With consumer prices turning up
moderately after first-half declines, real disposable income fell in
both the third and fourth quarters. The drop in real disposable income
in the fourth quarter was matched by a slight decline in real spending,
and the personal saving rate remained low, at 2.7 percent.
The weakness in consumer spending in the fourth quarter was more
than accounted for by a steep drop in motor vehicle purchases often the
expiration of the major incentive programs that had boosted third quarter
sales. Auto sales did revive temporarily in December, mainly reflecting
consumers' efforts to take advantage of sales tax deductions that were
eliminated after year-end; however, sales then slumped dramatically in
the first 20 days of January. Sales of imported autos gained ground
throughout 1986, despite dollar-related price increases, in part due to
new low-priced entrants from Korea. Indeed, imports set a quarterly
selling record in the fourth quarter--3.7 million units, at an annual
rate.
Excluding motor vehicles, real consumer expenditures rose 2.4
percent in the final quarter, matching the gain in the third quarter.
Real spending on durables, excluding autos, rose 12.1 percent, after a
14.5 percent gain in the third quarter. In part, this strength in
durable expenditures resulted from a surge in outlays for boats and
pleasure aircraft, likely in anticipation of the year-end tax changes.
Spending for furniture and household appliances, which had contributed

II-12
importantly to consumption growth earlier this year, slowed to just over
3.0 percent annualized increase in the fourth quarter.
Real nondurable expenditures were essentially unchanged for the
second consecutive quarter, as large increases for gasoline and oil
offset weakness in apparel and other nondurables. Real service expendi-
tures rose at a 2.3 percent annual rate last quarter, virtually the
same pace as in the third quarter.
Business Fixed Investment
Real spending for business fixed investment is estimated to have
fallen at a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. On the
equipment side, outlays were pulled down by a drop in motor vehicle
purchases. In contrast, investment in other equipment rose somewhat,
according to preliminary BEA estimates, though less than suggested by
the 3 percent increase in nondefense capital goods shipments by domestic
manufacturers. The discrepancy reflects, in part, an apparent improvement
in exports of capital goods, which are included in the shipments figures.
At the same time, the extent to which domestic shipments were augmented
by imports was somewhat less than earlier in the year.
Real outlays for nonresidential structures fell at a 3-1/2 percent
annual rate last quarter, the fourth consecutive quarterly decline.
December data for construction put-in-place, received after the BEA
made its outlays estimate, suggest nonresidential construction was even
weaker than indicated in the preliminary GNP figures. Most of the
major components of nonresidential construction contributed to the
fourth-quarter fall-off. In contrast, petroleum drilling activity
edged up after a pronounced slump in the first half.

II-14
Tax changes that took effect on January 1 probably had some infll5nce
on the pattern of investment late last year. In particular, the fourth-
quarter surge in purchases in some equipment categories suggests a
year-end bunching of purchases, even though the changes in tax provisions
for equipment were relatively minor. In contrast, there appears to
have been little acceleration of nonresidential construction outlays,
partly because many projects were exempted by transition rules from the
requirement that construction be finished by year-end to retain front-
loaded depreciation writeoffs. Moreover, developers of projects failing
to qualify for these transition rules-even if able to-may have been
unwilling to meet the December deadline, owing to the substantial costs
incurred in rushing projects to completion.
Over the four quarters of 1986, real investment outlays fell about
5-1/2 percent, an unusually weak performance for a year of overall
economic expansion. About one-half of last year's decline in outlays
resulted from the collapse in petroleum drilling activity. Much of the
remainder stemmed from the apparent shift of spending from early 1986
into late 1985, owing largely to attempts to beat the expected repeal
of the investment tax credit. Still, even after accounting for these
special factors, investment spending was lethargic last year, restrained
by the slowing of output growth and the presence of excess capacity
in many industries.
Leading indicators of investment spending suggest that overall
outlays will remain sluggish in coming quarters. Once the aircraft

II-15
group is excluded (to remove bookings that are filled with extremely
long lag and often show up as exports rather than domestic investment),
new orders for nondefense capital goods fell almost 4 percent in the
fourth quarter. In contrast, new commitments for nonresidential construction
have firmed in the last six months, suggesting that construction outlays
could level off temporarily in the near term. Nonetheless, with office
vacancy rates above 20 percent in major metropolitan areas, and excess
capacity in other sectors as well, the longer-term outlook for non-
residential construction is not encouraging. Moreover, survey readings
for the year as a whole suggest that total investment outlays will be
roughly flat. In particular, the Commerce Department survey, released
just after the December FOMC meeting, indicates that firms expect
nonminal spending to rise only 0.9 percent this year.
Inventories
Except for auto dealers' stocks, inventory investment in
manufacturing and trade remained moderate in late fall, with stocks
generally in line with sales. The inventory-sales ratio for all nonauto
establishments in manufacturing and trade was at the low end of the
range seen over the past year.
Manufacturing stocks declined through much of 1986 and remained
lean at year-end, consistent with the generally cautious inventory
behavior that producers have been following for some time. In some
industries (such as electrical machinery and consumer goods), the
recent pickup in orders and production may provide the potential for
restocking in the coming months. However, producers of basic metals
and some types of business equipment are still faced with sluggish
orders and may continue to be reluctant to restock.

In the trade sector, the accumulation of nonauto retail stocks in
early fall appears to have subsided in November, owing in part to a
steady growth in nonauto retail sales. In particular, retail stocks of
nondurable goods other than food were little changed in November after
a sizable buildup in the preceding two months. Judging by the advance
reports on orders and sales, the inventory situation at nonauto retail
establishments probably improved further in December. In the automotive
sector, dealer stocks continue to fluctuate with swings in sales.
Stocks appeared to be at reasonable levels at year-end relative to
historical experience, but probably accumulated considerably again in
January, given the recent drop in sales.
Housing Markets
After edging down for several months, housing starts rebounded in
December to a 1.80 million unit pace. Single-family starts were up 11
percent from November, spurred in part by declines in mortgage interest
rates to the lowest levels recorded in eight years. Even so, for the
quarter as a whole, single-family housing starts were little changed
from the third quarter.
Multifamily housing starts showed a surprising uptick in December,
but nevertheless contracted 10 percent in the fourth quarter as a whole
to a level one-fifth below a year earlier. The downward trend in the
pace of multifamily construction during 1986 in part reflects tax code
changes that lowered rates of return on rental property investments,1
1. Rental apartments recently have accounted for 70 to 80 percent of total
multifamily construction.

and sharply curtailed issuance of state and local government multifamily
mortgage revenue bonds. Further, rental vacancy rates in the mul ifamily
segment of the market reached 9.7 percent in the fourth quarter, the
highest level recorded in the 18-year history of the series. These
factors likely will continue to depress apartment construction in the
months to come.
Fourth-quarter data indicate no year-to-year rise in the constant-
quality new home price index. In contrast, the median sales price for
new homes--an indicator that does not adjust for either changes in size
and amenities of new homes or the regional mix of sales--was up 8.7
percent over the same period. Existing homes posted a lower, 6.8
percent median price gain during the year ending in December.
Southern states experienced a 6 percent contraction in the pace
of housing construction in 1986, owing largely to weak demand in oil-
producing states and a continuing surplus of multifamily units. While
the South continues to account for more housing construction than any
other region, its share of the national total has declined during the
recent housing expansion--from over 50 percent in 1983 to about 40
percent in 1986. In the Northeast, by contrast, housing demand has
been robust. Total housing starts rose 17 percent in that region last
year, reflecting a 24 percent increase in single-family construction.
During the 1983-86 period, housing starts in the Northeast surged 75
percent, increasing that region's share of national activity from 10 to
16 percent. Strong income growth, favorable demographics, and rates of
housing price appreciation substantially above the national average are

among the factors underlying the impressive pace of housing construction
in the Northeast.
Federal Government
Real federal purchases rose sharply in the fourth quarter of 1986,
but the increase was due almost entirely to a surge in agricultural loans
made by the Commodity Credit Corporation. (BEA estimates that these CCC
transactions were offset by a decline in farm stocks, so that GNP was
unaffected.) Military spending, which had increased at nearly a 20
percent annual rate in the second and third quarters, was down 4 percent
in the fourth quarter. For the year as a whole, real defense spending
continued to trend up despite reductions in appropriations. The latest
calendar-year gain was more than 7 percent, somewhat larger than in
other recent years as the value of equipment deliveries and R&D spending
rose sharply. In contrast, nondefense purchases excluding CCC, which
were up slightly in the fourth quarter, declined 2 percent over the
year, reflecting budget cuts.
With the submission of the President's proposals at the beginning
of 1987, Congress began to formulate the FY1988 federal budget resolution,
scheduled to be passed by April 15. The resolution sets limits and
targets for subsequent appropriations and other spending and revenue
legislation. Under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the deficit
target is $108 billion, compared with an actual deficit of $221 billion
in FY1986 and roughly $175 billion now projected by the Administration
and the Congressional Budget Office for FY1987.
To meet the FY1988 target, the President proposed deficit-reducing
actions that included selected small revenue increases, further sales of

II-22
financial and physical assets, and additional cuts in domestic programs.
However, in a preliminary analysis prepared for the Senate Budget Committee,
CBO has suggested that the Administration's proposals, if enacted, would
fall short of the amount needed to meet the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target,
and the FY1988 deficit would be in the $135 to $140 billion range.
Relative to the Administration's estimates, CBO's analysis used less
optimistic economic and technical estimating assumptions. In recent
years, CBO's assumptions have underlaid figures in the budget resolution.
Tables that detail the President's budget, CBO's baseline estimates, and
other related data are provided in a statistical appendix to the Greenbook
Supplement.
In addition to the FY1988 budget, Congress is expected to consider
in the current session a number of proposals to reform the budget process.
The President has again requested that changes be made to allow for a
line-item veto of major spending bills. Moreover, he has asked that the
President's signature be required for the Congressional Budget Resolution.
Other proposals pending would change a number of major appropriations
from an annual to a multiyear basis; a bill submitted by Senators Domenici
and Roth would put the entire federal budget on a biennial cycle.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
rose 4.6 percent in 1986, the largest annual increase since 1970. Most of
the strength last year was attributable to investment in infrastructure--
primarily of educational, correctional, and water facilities-stemming from
a need for new building as well as modernization of existing structures.

II-24
The budget position of state and local governments weakened
considerably last year. Excluding special one-time inflows--such as
previously escrowed oil lease payments--the combined surplus of the
operating and capital accounts (excluding social insurance funds) fell
to near zero in 1986. Moreover, recent surveys tend to substantiate a
picture of still eroding budget positions. By the middle of fiscal
1987, 22 states, primarily in the farm belt and oil patch, had cut or
planned to cut their current general funds budgets to avoid a deficit,
and several other states are expected to follow suit soon. (All but
four states end their fiscal year on June 30.) In addition, more than
a third of all cities expect to raise taxes, and more than half plan to
raise fees in calendar 1987. These actions come on the heels of similar
adjustments in 1986 necessitated by weakened fiscal positions.
Prices
Recent price reports indicate that the rate of inflation remained
relatively moderate at year-end. The November and December increases
in the CPI were in the 0.2 to 0.3 percent range, and the PPI for finished
goods was unchanged in December, after rising 0.2 percent in November.
Energy prices picked up somewhat in December, but food prices eased and
price increases for other goods and services were similar to their average
pace earlier in the year. For 1986 as a whole, the steep declines in
energy prices during the year held the CPI advance to only 1.1 percent
and were responsible for a 2-1/2 percent drop in the PPI for finished
goods. The fixed-weighted price index for GNP--a broad measure of price
change for national output-rose 2.4 percent from 1985-Q4 to 1986-Q4,
compared with 3.6 percent during the preceding year.

In December, retail prices of gasoline and fuel oil rose about 1
percent, apparently in lagged response to the upturn in world crude oil
prices. Despite these increases, prices of both products remained more
than 30 percent below their December 1985 levels. Crude oil prices rose
sharply around the turn of the year, reflecting the December OPEC agreement
and severe winter weather in Europe, and these increases are likely to
show up at the retail level in coming months.
In contrast to energy, the rise in consumer food prices slowed to
0.2 percent in December, after rapid increases earlier in the year that
were partly weather-related. At the farm level, crude food prices were
down over the last two months of the year, and in spot commodity markets,
most agricultural prices continued to weaken into early 1987, before
turning up in the latter part of January.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose 0.3 percent in both
November and December, about the average pace for the year as a whole
but less than in 1984 and 1985. A deceleration in the index for the
commodities component, to around 1-1/2 percent for the year, mainly
reflected a decline in used car prices of about 5 percent. Prices of
nonenergy services also rose less than in 1985, with the slowdown
widespread.
Prices of non-oil merchandise imports at the dockside-as measured
by the BEA fixed-weighted price series-picked up markedly in 1986,
responding with some lag to the lower exchange value of the dollar. Over
the four quarters of 1986, the increase was 6-3/4 percent, compared with
a decline of about 1 percent in 1985. The 1986 increases were dominated
by autos and other consumer durables, as well as capital goods. Despite

II-27
the increases in point-of-entry prices, there is little evidence as of
yet of a significant effect on domestic retail prices, apart from autos
and a few other categories.
In recent months, commodity prices have risen notably, although
from depressed levels. This pickup is evident not only in the petroleum
sector, but also for a number of industrial materials, as indicated for
example, in summary measures such as those maintained by the Commodity
Research Bureau and the Journal of Commerce.
Wages and Labor Costs
Most available measures of labor costs continued to show moderate
rates of wage increase in the final quarter of 1986. The hourly earnings
index (HEI), which covers production and nonsupervisory workers, rose
at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, and only 2.2 percent
last year, after increasing 3 percent in 1985.
A more comprehensive measure of labor costs, the Employment Cost
Index (ECI), indicated that wages and salaries rose 3 percent last
year, down from 4 percent in the preceding two years. The deceleration
probably reflects, at least in part, a downward adjustment in inflation
and probably in inflation expectations. Increases in fringe benefits,
which slowed significantly in 1985, remained moderate last year and, as
a result, hourly compensation in the ECI continued to rise at about the
same pace as wages and salaries.
The continued deceleration of compensation this past year has
come mainly from such service-producing industries as finance, insurance
and real estate, transportation and public utilities, and wholesale and

retail trade, which granted the largest wage increases in 1985. As a
result, hourly compensation in the service-producing sector rose last
year at about the same pace as in the goods-producing industries; this
contrasts with the generally higher rates of wage inflation in the
service-producing sector during the preceding four years. By
occupation, wage increases for white-collar workers continued to exceed
those for blue-collar workers in 1986, although the disparity in growth
rates was considerably less in 1985.
The unionized sector continues to experience relatively small wage
increases. Negotiated wage adjustments for the 2.5 million private
industry workers reaching major new settlements over the period averaged
just 1.2 percent in the first year of the contract and 1.8 percent
annually over the life of the contract, exclusive of lump-sum payments
and COLAs. Indeed, more than 20 percent of the workers covered by new
settlements in 1986 accepted initial wage cuts or freezes. However,
more than 40 percent of these workers received lump-sum payments,
augmenting the modest wage gains.
Low rates of consumer price increase virtually eliminated COLA
payments last year. As a result, compensation for unionized workers,
which includes lump sums, increased only 2 percent over 1986 as measured
by the ECI, well below the 3-1/2 percent increase for nonunionized
workers.
Looking ahead to this year, deferred increases and lump-sum
payments will account for most of the increase in union compensation.
Deferred changes are scheduled to contribute about 1-1/2 percentage
points to overall union wage change for workers under major private

II-30
industry agreements. About a third of the employees covered by major
collective bargaining agreements in private industry and state and local
governments are scheduled to bargain. In the private sector, contract
talks in automobile manufacturing cover about 575,000 workers, the largest
number of workers in a private industry affected by 1987 negotiations.
Settlements here are expected to be moderate as negotiations focus on job
security and labor cost containment. Elsewhere in the private sector,
negotiations in trade and construction will also be important this
year. Almost 40 percent of workers slated for 1987 contract negotiations
are covered by state and local government agreements where contracts
reached during 1986 provided an average wage adjustment of nearly 6
percent.

APPENDIX
ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE BUDGET UPDATES
The tables that follow summarize the recent federal budget estimates
of the Administration and Congressional Budget Office.
* Table 1 details the Administration's current services budget. The
current services budget is an estimate of receipts and outlays as
they would evolve under the Administration's economic assumptions
in the absence of changes in federal laws or policies. Cost
estimates are typically raised through time to maintain program
levels in real terms. In addition, for entitlement programs,
increases in the number of eligible participants are taken into
account. However, the administration has set "current services"
defense outlays at levels that would provide the three percent real
growth that is now the Administration's policy. Interest outlays
are allowed to rise or fall to meet the change in costs of servicing
the public debt.
* Table 2 lists the Administration's proposals for deficit reduction.
According to these estimates, the FY1988 deficit would decline from
the $150 billion under current services to $108 billion--the target
mandated by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. Similarly, deficit
reduction measures proposed for subsequent years are estimated to
be sufficient to lower the deficit further and to meet nearly the
requirement of balance by 1991.
* Table 3 shows the Administration and CBO economic assumptions that
underlie their respective budget estimates.
* Table 4 details the CBO baseline budget. The baseline concept is
similar to the current services concept. The figures in this table
differ from the Administration's current services estimates mainly
because CBO: (1) uses different economic assumptions, (2) assumes
zero real growth in defense authorizations, and (3) uses different
technical assumptions related to program spend-out rates.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most short-term interest rates are about unchanged, on balance, since
the last FOMC meeting, while changes in longer-term rates are mixed-Treasury
yields are up somewhat but private capital market rates are down. Short-
term rates rose sharply in late December against a backdrop of hectic
churning in financial markets related to year-end "window dressing" and
efforts to beat the deadline for favorable tax treatment on certain trans-
actions. The federal funds rate soared to double-digit levels in the final
days of 1986, and other short-term private market rates also jumped. After
the turn of the year, the pressures abated and money market rates more than
reversed the earlier increases; however, a more recent firming in the
reserve market and uncertainties about the consequences of the sharp decline
in the dollar have pushed most short-term rates back up to their mid-December
levels.
Fluctuations in longer-term rates have been comparatively moderate.
Treasury bond yields have risen, on net, since mid-December, but corporate
and municipal rates have fallen somewhat, owing in part to a drop-off in
securities issuance. Stock prices have rallied dramatically this year.
Growth in the monetary aggregates picked up markedly in December,
undoubtedly influenced by the increased volume of financial transactions
near the end of the year. Under the impetus of a surge in demand deposits,
M1 spurted ahead at a 28-1/2 percent annual rate, pushing growth for the
year to 15-1/4 percent. The broader aggregates also experienced faster
growth in December, and finished the year in the vicinity of the upper ends
of their target ranges. Available data indicate that M1 growth slowed
appreciably in January, with demand deposits running off after the year-end

calculated on an end-month-of-quarter basis.
2. Nontransactions M2 is seasonally adjusted as a whole.
3. Growth rates are for savings deposits, seasonally adjusted, plus money market deposit accounts (MMDAs), not sea-
sonally adjusted. Commercial bank savings deposits excluding MMDAs increased during December 1986 and January 1987 at
rates of 33.5 percent and 40 percent, respectively. At thrift institutions, savings deposits excluding MIDAs increased
during December 1986 and January 1987 at rates of 22.0 percent and 29 percent, respectively.

surge. The deceleration in the M1 component slowed M2 growth in January,
while enlarged issuance by banks of large time deposits helped to keep
M3 growing at about its December rate.
Total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors expanded rapidly in
December, when tax-related transactions bloated demands for funds, but
the increase appears to have slowed in January. Nonfinancial firms, in a
spate of merger and restructuring activities, borrowed heavily from banks
in December; bank borrowing also may have been boosted by the spike in
rates on commercial paper at year-end that prompted a runoff in outstanding
paper of nonfinancial businesses. In January, bank loan growth slowed but
remained strong, while outstanding paper dropped further. Residential
mortgage debt continued to expand briskly late in the year, while consumer
installment credit was almost unchanged in December, perhaps in part
reflecting increasing use of home equity lines of credit in place of
consumer borrowing. Fragmentary data suggest that this pattern may have
continued in January. Federal and state and local borrowing was strong in
December, but slackened in January.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Note on the monetary data: Annual benchmark and seasonal factor
revisions are currently in process. The data reported here are on
an unrevised basis. A discussion of revisions to the monetary
aggregates will be included in the Bluebook.
Demand deposit growth surged in December to a 38 percent annual rate,
as the impending change in tax laws triggered an unusually heavy volume
of financial transactions. Most of this bulge was temporary: demand
deposits appear to have run off at a double-digit rate in January. As a
result, M1 growth is estimated to have slowed considerably in January--to
about a 10 percent rate. Growth of other checkable deposits in January is

1. Opportunity cost is defined as the difference between
the 3-month Treasury bill rate and the NOW account rate at
commercial banks. NOW account rates through 1985 are super
NOW rates adjusted for comparability with reported rates on
all NOW accounts after removal in January 1986 of ceilings
on rates for regular NOW accounts.
The recent pattern of M2 growth has been dominated by the swing in
Ml and, despite some strengthening in the nontransactions component, M2
growth slowed to about an 8 percent annual rate in January. The shift
toward more liquid retail deposits continued in recent months, although
the runoff in small time deposits is estimated to have slowed to about a
2 percent pace in January. M3 growth increased to over 9 percent in
December: both its M2 and non-M2 components grew more rapidly. M3 growth
in January is estimated at near December's pace, with commercial banks
increasing sharply their issuance of large CDs.
Bank credit increased markedly in December and January. Much of the
acceleration was attributable to business lending, which surged to nearly a
40 percent annual rate in December and 34 percent in January at U.S. banking
offices. Most of the business loan growth in both months was concentrated

at large banks and at U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, although
small banks also increased their lending to businesses. Business borrowing
at foreign branches of U.S. banks declined in December, partly because of
the shifting of loans from foreign to domestic offices of U.S. banks, as
businesses found prime-based credit options (which tend to be booked domesti-
cally) to be preferable when LIBOR jumped near year-end. Prime-based loans
also looked attractive, temporarily, given the runup in commercial paper
rates, and nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding declined.
Real estate lending also increased rapidly in December and January,
perhaps owing to stepped-up real estate closings towards year-end and to
increased use of home equity lines of credit that serve as a substitute for
consumer loans. Results of the January Senior Loan Officer Survey suggest
strong growth of home equity lending late last year, and no districts
reported any weakening in growth so far this year. Paying down consumer
debt was cited as an important use of recent home equity loans, although
the majority of this type of debt outstanding has been taken on to finance
purchases or improvements in real estate or purchases of other big ticket
items. Banks again added to their holdings of U.S. government securities
in both December and January, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous
two months, and they continued to reduce their holdings of other securities.
Corporate Finance
Debt of nonfinancial businesses increased at a strong pace in December,
with the bulk of the rise in shorter-term liabilities. Combined bank loans
and commercial paper outstanding grew at a 26 percent clip in the final
month of 1986. In January, short-term borrowing by nonfinancial businesses
appears to have moderated, the arithmetic of monthly averaging obscuring to

some extent the weakening in bank lending and exaggerating the decline in
commercial paper outstanding. Longer-term financing by nonfinancial corpo-
rations increased a bit in December: gross issuance of bonds was slightly
above its fourth-quarter pace. In January, bond financing slackened, with
a dearth of new low-rated issues accounting for the drop-off.
Some of the fourth-quarter momentum behind business borrowing was
attributable to a pickup in share retirements, as the timing of mergers and
other corporate restructurings was geared to beat the impending effective
date for changes in the tax law. At a more fundamental level, capital outlays
of nonfinancial corporations may have grown faster than internally generated
funds in the fourth quarter, producing a small financing gap.
The volume of new issues of corporate equities was heavy in December
and for the fourth quarter as a whole. Offerings tapered off in the past
month, however, even though share prices skyrocketed. The market value of
common stocks has risen more than $300 billion so far this year--exceeding
the market appreciation for all of 1986. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
has surpassed its 1986 high by 11 percent, and most other market indexes
also have posted record highs. Mutual fund managers report that the market
rally has attracted strong inflows into equity funds, but most also note
that they have detected little switching out of bond funds.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The combined deficit of the federal government is expected to total
$53 billion in the first quarter of calendar 1987; this estimate is subject
to unusual uncertainty, however, owing to changes in receipts arising from
the Tax Reform Act. Retroactive repeal of the investment tax credit is
expected to boost this quarter's tax receipts by $8 to $13 billion, in

III-10
the final installment of corporate taxes for 1986 to be paid on March 15.
Tax receipts were augmented also in January by heavy final quarterly
estimated personal tax payments, which were due by January 15; the pickup
in payments probably reflected estimated taxes on increased long-term
capital gains realizations prior to the December 31 deadline for preferential
treatment.
The Treasury is expected to cover the bulk of this quarter's deficit
by borrowing $31 billion, net, from the public and running down its high
cash balance. In marked contrast to the last two quarters when bill auctions
raised a substantial portion of the new cash, marketable coupon issues will
more than account for the funds raised in the current period. The Treasury
is expected to pay down, on net, about $8 billion of bills.
Issuance of nonmarketable debt also is likely to shrink dramatically
this quarter--perhaps bringing in only $3 billion of new cash, compared
with nearly $15 billion in the fourth quarter. This falloff in issuance
can be attributed to lessened demand for Treasury savings bonds, now that
the guaranteed minimum rate paid has been reduced from 7-1/2 to 6 percent,
and to a moderating in the Treasury's issuance of special state and local
government issues.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies is expected to
total a bit more than $1 billion in the first quarter, well below the
volume in preceding quarters. The Federal Home Loan Banks borrowed heavily
in December, as the demand of thrift institutions for advances was unusually
strong around the end of the year when market yields soared. So far in
1987, however, thrifts have started to repay advances and credit needs of
the FHLBs likely will shrink in the current quarter. Borrowing by Fannie

III-ll
Mae also picked up in the fourth quarter, when funding requirements were
enlarged by a slowing in both mortgage prepayments and sales of loans from
its portfolio. Fannie Mae probably will pay down debt in the first quarter,
because its purchases of mortgages are expected to diminish, as competing
CMO sales grow, and because some part of this year's funding needs appear to
have been met in advance through borrowing late last year. The Farm Credit
Banks paid down a large volume of outstanding debt in January, reflecting
weak demand on the banks for longer-term funds. Further paydowns also are
expected this quarter.1
Tax-Exempt Securities Market
Gross offerings of tax-exempt bonds trended up after passage of tax
reform early in the fourth quarter, with a sizable volume of private-
purpose bonds for housing and industrial development being brought to market.
Earlier, the tax status of private-purpose debt under the various tax reform
proposals had been uncertain. When these uncertainties were removed,
issuers sought to market bonds prior to year-end so they could be included
under 1986 volume caps. In January, private-purpose issuance dropped
appreciably; overall tax-exempt volume was buoyed to an extent, however,
by a continued large issuance of refunding bonds attracted by some of the
lowest rates on municipal bonds since 1979.
Taxable municipal bond issuance has remained very light this year.
The market in these bonds has yet to shake off the questions raised last
fall about aggressive arbitrage transactions and the key role of one major
insurance company that was able to offer issuers high-yield guaranteed
investment contracts because it invested heavily in low-grade corporate bonds.

Rates on revenue and general obligation bonds have fallen more than 30
basis points since the December FOMC meeting, compared with small increases
in yields on Treasury bonds. Demand for tax-exempt bonds by property and
casualty insurance companies, bond funds, and bank trust departments reportedly
has been strong, and rates began to move down early in 1987 as new supplies
shrank.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates in primary and secondary home mortgage markets have
declined further since the last FOMC meeting. For conventional fixed-rate
loans, the contract interest rate on new commitments offered by S&Ls has
recently averaged 9.12 percent, down 18 basis points from its level in mid-
December and almost 2 percentage points below its level of a year ago.
Similarly, rates on FNMA commitments to purchase fixed-rate conventional
mortgages have declined nearly 30 basis points over the intermeeting period.
The declines prompted the Veterans Administration to cut its maximum rate
on VA-guaranteed loans from 9 percent to 8-1/2 percent, as of January 19.

Reflecting the reduced cost of home mortgage credit and the incentive
under tax reform to sell appreciated real estate before the end of 1986,
the pace of mortgage lending was brisk late last year. Preliminary data
for the fourth quarter indicate that growth of outstanding residential
mortgage debt jumped to about a 16 percent annual rate. Mortgage originations
at FSLIC-insured thrifts totaled $30 billion in December, easily eclipsing
October's record. Despite the heavy volume, thrift holdings of mortgage
assets rose only $4 billion in December-somewhat less than the average
monthly increase in 1986--as FSLIC-insured thrift institutions disposed of
many of these fixed-rate originations through sales in the secondary market.
Mortgage-backed securities continued to be the dominant channel for housing
finance. Offerings of federally related pass-throughs totaled nearly $32
billion during December, bringing the fourth-quarter volume to a record
$88-1/2 billion.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit expanded in December at less than a 1
percent annual rate, down from 6-3/4 percent in November and substantially
below the pace in the preceding two months. (Figures confidential until
released February 6.) The earlier strength reflected effects of auto sales
incentive programs, which ballooned auto credit extensions. Growth of
nonauto credit, although jumping in November, generally trended down in
1986--especially the growth in revolving credit (primarily credit card debt).
Revolving credit contracted at about a 2 percent rate in December, compared
with annualized growth rates of 20 percent in 1985. It seems likely that
increasing utilization of home equity credit lines has cut into the growth
of credit card debt, which typically carries much higher interest charges

III-16
that no longer are fully tax-deductible. Many institutions are offering
home equity lines with initial interest rates of 5 to 7 percent, which
generally revert after a few months to variable rates indexed 1 to 2 per-
centage points above prime. Other lenders are waiving or sharply reducing
closing costs that might otherwise amount to $500 or more.
While few data are available on the amount of borrowing under home
equity lines or the uses to which the funds are put, industry observers
place the total volume of such credit outstanding at about $40 billion, as
much as $20 billion (net) of which may have been added during 1986. Lenders
indicate a diversity of uses for home equity credit lines. In the January
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, respondents estimated that about 36 per-
cent of the outstanding borrowing under home equity lines had gone to finance
purchases or improvements of real estate and 28 percent had been used to
retire other debts. The survey also indicated that 9 out of 10 banks plan
to step up promotional efforts this year.

APPENDIX*
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN AGRICULTURAL FINANCE
The Farm Credit System
On January 15, the Farm Credit System (FCS) issued a press release
indicating that its independent auditor likely will give a qualified
opinion of the combined financial accounts of the FCS for 1986. Price
Waterhouse's concern is that, in light of recent losses and the absence
of clear evidence of a return to profitability in the near future, the
system may not be able to continue obtaining adequate financing in the
markets unless stronger assurance of federal assistance is forthcoming.
The press release also updated previous public statements by FCS on
litigation involving system institutions and their regulator, the Farm
Credit Administration (FCA).
The system's 1986 financial report will be issued this month and
probably will show a loss for the full year in excess of $2 billion, if
FCA projections of last fall prove to be correct. Over the first three
quarters of the year, the system lost $1.5 billion, the bulk of which
represented provisions for loan losses. There appears to be little
chance for substantial improvement in 1987, as the system faces a growing
volume of nonperforming loans and a flight of high quality borrowers at
a time when its average cost of funds remains well above market. Non-
accrual loans reached almost 13 percent of total loans at the end of the
third quarter, and other high risk loans accounted for another 7 percent.
Total capital of the FCS has declined. At the end of the third quarter,
$1.9 billion in accumulated surplus remained; it, along with $3.6 billion
of loan loss reserves, is available to offset losses--and must be used
before the system can seek federal assistance under the provisions of the
1985 amendments to the Farm Credit Act.
The remaining capital surplus is very unevenly distributed among
system units. In the past, weaker institutions have been shored up by
transfers of capital from stronger units, but resistance to further trans-
fers is growing. During the third quarter, six Federal Land Banks needed
capital assistance totalling $415 million to prevent capital impairment--
that is, net worth dropping below the book value of capital shares that
borrowers own. At the urging of stronger units, a system agreement to
provide this assistance requires that the assistance be reversed or
cancelled when regulatory accounting practices (RAP) are implemented
under authority granted in the 1986 amendments to the Farm Credit Act.
However, exercising its regulatory authority, the FCA has ruled that the
assistance cannot be reversed.
*The section on the Farm Credit System was prepared by Gary Gillum,
Economist, Banking Section, Division of Research and Statistics. The
section on the new farm bankruptcy chapter was prepared by Emil Melichar,
Senior Economist, Economic Activity Section, Division of Research and
Statistics.
III-A-1

III-A-2
Regulations that temporarily govern the use of RAP are now in
place. Institutions will be permitted to utilize RAP in reporting finan-
cial results for the fourth quarter of 1986, if using generally accepted
accounting principles would result in capital impairment. By capitalizing
unusually large loan losses and certain excess interest costs and
amortizing them over a period of up to 20 years, all units of the FCS
apparently will be able to avoid capital impairment on a regulatory basis
at the end of 1986. However, the use of RAP will not obviate the need by
weaker units of the system for further financial assistance in 1987 if
they are to maintain adequate collateral behind their debt, as required
by the Farm Credit Act, and to remain viable institutions.
Despite the need for further financial assistance for the weaker
units of the system, stronger units have undertaken a number of legal
legal challenges to both the constitutionality of capital transfers and
the regulations established by the FCA for carrying out these transfers.
Most of these challenges have been unsuccessful, but one permanent and
two temporary injunctions have been issued barring capital transfers from
certain FCS units. The permanent injunction is being appealed, and FCA
has taken the position that the injunctions apply only to the specific
transfers being challenged. However, the process of providing capital
assistance effectively has been stymied.
Market reaction to the press release has been muted, with spreads
between the interest rates on outstanding FCS debt and comparable
Treasuries widening by a few basis points but only for a day or two.
Since then, new three- and six-month debt was issued on February 2.
Although the interest rates received gave no evidence of lessened market
acceptance, the system's dealers did indicate that a stronger than usual
sales effort was required, despite a substantial paydown of maturing
debt. On balance, it appears that the system's market access has been
little affected by the recent FCS statement, presumably reflecting market
assumptions that federal assistance will be forthcoming on a timely
basis.
New farm bankruptcy chapter and farm lending experience at commercial banks
Late last year, Congress provided a new reorganization option for
financially distressed family farms. Chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code
became effective November 26, 1986, and expires on October 1, 1993.
Attorneys have described the new Chapter 12 as combining elements of the
streamlined procedures of Chapter 13 and the more complex reorganization
procedures of Chapter 11, while recognizing some unique aspects of farming.
In general, a family farmer who owes less than $1.5 million can file for
Chapter 12 bankruptcy, and then must submit a reorganization plan within
90 days. Under the plan, secured debt may be written down to the current
market value of the collateral, while creditors may receive all of the
debtor's projected disposable income over the next three years (or for up
to five years if approved by the court "for cause"). Unsecured creditors
cannot block the plan, but must receive at least as much as they would
have received in a Chapter 7 liquidation.

III-A-3
The new chapter and the mandatory arbitration law recently passed
in Minnesota are legislative responses to widespread public perception of
and concern about "unfair" treatment of financially-distressed farmers,
in the following sense: A lender forecloses on a farmer whose debt far
exceeds the value of the property; and then sells the property at its
current market value, recovering only that proportion of the debt. The
foreclosed farmer then states that if the lender had reduced his debt to
the same level, he could have handled the payments and the loss of the
family farm and home would have been avoided. Adverse reactions were
heightened when, as is customary in lender sales of foreclosed nonfarm
properties, favorable financing was offered to the new buyers. Many
lenders have shared these concerns and have been negotiating debt
restructuring with distressed farm borrowers. The new legislation
formalizes one model of this process and permits borrowers to force some
reluctant lenders into it.
Debtors filing Chapter 12 bankruptcy will incur substantial costs
in the form of legal fees and the trustee's fee--in addition to reasonable
expenses, the trustee may receive up to 10 percent of the first $450,000
of payments made under the plan, and up to 3 percent of the remainder.
Management flexibility is reduced during the plan period, and some debtors
may experience unfavorable income tax consequences. Thus it is thought
that debtors will use the threat of Chapter 12 to encourage lenders to
negotiate restructuring of debt, while both sides try to avoid an actual
filing.
Lenders generally believe that Chapter 12 outcomes will be
disadvantageous; however, if the property and income are fairly valued,
the required write-off is a loss that has already occurred as collateral
values and the net worth of the borrower have declined. But compared
with foreclosure or liquidation, the disadvantage to the lender is that
he emerges with a borrower with 100 percent financing while farm asset
values are still trending downward. And, compared with private negotia-
tion, the amount of debt cancelled may be greater; for example, one
debt restructuring plan that has received favorable comment from farm
organizations calls for debt service to be reduced to a manageable level
but for all debt to be repaid eventually.
While the Chapter 12 provisions limit the flexibility lenders may
have, it may be questioned whether the consequences for farm loan avail-
ability will be as adverse as some have suggested. Chapter 12 changes
somewhat the cost, relative amount, and timing of recovery of bad loans.
But this is not likely to be the major factor considered by most lenders
contemplating entry into or exit from farm lending, farm loans to new or
financially secure customers, or additional advances to borrowers already
in distress.
Similarly, Chapter 12 seems unlikely to be a major influence on
bank experience with farm loans or on the fortunes of agricultural banks.
In this connection, it is relevant that total farm debt already has been
reduced by about $30 billion since its recent peak, of which about $7

III-A-4
billion occurred at commercial banks. Much of this reduction consisted
of troubled debt. Recent banking data indicate that the amount of delin-
quent farm loans at banks may have peaked in 1986; for instance, all farm
production loans that were nonperforming or past due 30 days or more on
September 30, 1986, totaled $3.1 billion, down from $3.5 billion a year
earlier. At agricultural banks, the proportion of total loans that were
in nonaccrual status, which had risen in nearly every quarter from 0.8
percent in December 1982 to 3.3 percent in March 1986, fell to 3.0 per-
cent by September. Consequently, the number of vulnerable agricultural
banks (banks at which nonperforming loans exceeded total capital) has
increased little over the past year, and the relative importance of farm
loans among total loans at the nation's vulnerable banks has declined to
6 percent, compared with 15 percent a year earlier and a peak ratio of 19
percent in March 1985.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dollar has
declined about 8 percent, on balance, against the currencies of the
other G-10 countries, since the December FOMC meeting. The dollar
first fell sharply as a much larger-than-expected preliminary estimate
of the November trade deficit and subsequent statements by U.S.
officials prompted concern in the market that the dollar would have to
go lower to produce the necessary adjustment in U.S. external accounts.
.Although the decline in the dollar's value in
late December was associated in part with a firming of German interest
rates, the dollar apparently has derived little benefit as those rates
have moved back down with the reduction in the German discount rate on
January 23. The dollar firmed strongly toward the end of the
intermeeting period following the release of substantially
better-than-expected preliminary figures on U.S. merchandise trade for
December and a downward revised estimate of the November deficit, but
subsequently those gains were partially eroded. Since the last FOMC
meeting, the dollar has declined by 10 percent against the mark, 7
percent against the yen, and 3-3/4 percent against the Canadian dollar.

.The Desk intervened for the U.S.
account on one occasion, purchasing $50 million against yen at about
150.50 yen/dollar, split 50/50 between the Federal Reserve and Treasury.
the Canadian dollar has benefited from an improved fiscal outlook and
the recent firming in the dollar price of some commodities.
The dollar's sharp decline against the mark and the rise in German
interest rates at year-end led to strains within the European Monetary
System.
A realignment of
parities within the European monetary grid was announced on January 11;
the German mark and Dutch guilder were revalued by 3 percent and the
Belgian franc was revalued by 2 percent against all other currencies in
the EMS. At the same time, suggestions were made concerning future
reductions in German interest rates. Reflows into the weaker EMS
currencies, which typically have followed a realignment, have been
light, apparently reflecting some doubts by market participants that
these adjustments will prove to be adequate.
The Bundesbank lowered its discount and Lombard rates 1/2
percentage point each to 3 and 5 percent, respectively, effective
January 23; these measures were part of a package in which it also
raised reserve requirements by 10 percent and reduced discount quotas by
DM 8 billion, effective February 2. The latter measures evidently were
intended to sterilize some of the capital inflows of marks not reversed
after the EMS realignment. However, Bundesbank President Poehl

IV-4
indicated that these moves provided German authorities more latitude to
support the dollar. All in all, it appears that the Bundesbank intends
to guide market rates lower; the latest repurchase agreement was offered
at a fixed rate of 3.8 percent, well below the 4.6 percent average rate
for funds allocated in the last tender.
Interest rate developments for individual countries during the
intermeeting period are summarized in the table in the lower panel.
Short-term interest rates in Germany moved down about 80 basis points
after a run-up at year-end, while comparable rates in Japan declined
about 40 basis points. Short-term rates in most EMS countries firmed
prior to the realignment on January 11; since then, interest rates in
many of these countries have eased somewhat. In Canada, short-term
interest rates fell 90 basis points. In contrast, rates on 90-day U.S.
CDs were about unchanged, on balance.

IV-5
Bank lending to foreigners in the third quarter of 1986. U.S.-
chartered banks' claims on foreigners were virtually unchanged in the
third quarter of last year. However, after adjustment for a rise of 5
percent in the weighted average dollar during the quarter, claims appear
to have increased about $7 billion (1.7 percent). This was the first
quarterly increase on an exchange-rate-adjusted basis since 1984-QII.
In the interim, adjusted claims declined an estimated $13 billion in the
first half of 1986 and $29 billion in 1985.
Changes in claims on country groups in the third quarter, on an
unadjusted basis, showed small declines in every case except for an
increase in claims on offshore banking centers. However, claims on G-10
countries can be assumed to have risen on an adjusted basis, because this
group includes most of the banks' foreign-currency-denominated claims,
and thus is the location for most of the upward adjustment for exchange
rate changes. Claims on the non-OPEC developing countries presumably
declined almost the same amount on an adjusted basis as is shown by the
unadjusted figures, since such lending is almost wholly
dollar-denominated. As in the two preceding quarters of 1986, there was
a small drop in claims on Latin America and a larger decrease in claims
on Asia and Africa; these brought the declines for the nine months to
$1.1 billion vis-a-vis Latin America and $4.3 billion vis-a-vis Asia and
Africa. Of the latter amount, $2.1 billion was a fall in claims on
Korea, where a large improvement in the current account has led to net
repayments of foreign bank credits.
Third-quarter data for all banks in the BIS quarterly reporting
system show a very large rise in total claims on foreigners of

dressing by Japanese banks. The BIS banks' claims on non-OPEC developing
countries were virtually unchanged in the third quarter, as a small rise
in claims on Asian and African countries in this group was approximately
offset by a further decrease in claims on Latin American countries,
principally Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. This brought the decline
in claims on the Latin American countries in the first three quarters of
the year to more than $3 billion; the largest declines have been
vis-a-vis Mexico ($1.3 billion), Chile and Colombia ($0.6 billion each),
and Peru ($0.5 billion).

IV-8
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Capital inflows resulting from the growth of official reserve assets
in the United States tapered off in October and November of 1986. (See
line 4 the Summary Table on U.S. International Transactions.) After rates
of accumulation averaging more than $4 billion per month in the second and
third quarters of last year, the reserve holdings of the G-10 countries
increased only $1.7 billion in October and fell slightly in November. In
addition, the reported reserve holdings of OPEC members resumed their
decrease in these two months. Partly offsetting these reductions in
official capital inflows was the continued reserve accumulation of Taiwan:
during October and November, Taiwan is reported to have increased its
reserve assets in the United States by almost $1.3 billion, bringing its
reserve accumulation in the United States for the first eleven months of
1986 to more than $9.6 billion. For the year through November, total
reported reserve accumulation by all foreign countries was over $33
billion. Partial information from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
indicates that December's changes in the official reserve holdings of the
G-10 countries, OPEC, and Taiwan continued to follow the patterns set in
the first two months of the fourth quarter. Intervention in January,
however, should generate some official capital inflows in early 1987.
Net purchases of U.S. Treasury obligations by foreigners other than
official reserve holders (line 3) fell in October and November.
November's net outflow arose largely from the net sales of $2 billion by
nonmonetary international organizations. Reported holdings of Japanese
residents were essentially unchanged. For the year through November,

private foreigners generated $9 billion in net capital inflows through
transactions in U.S. Treasury obligations.
After record high net purchase of U.S. corporate stocks (line 2b) in
the first three quarters of 1986, recorded net inflows attributable to
these transactions stopped in the fourth quarter, October showing net
sales by foreigners of $1.3 billion and November showing negligible net
purchases. Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds (line 2a)
continued in October and November but at a slower pace. Offsetting these
reductions in capital inflows in October was a surge in net sales of
foreign securities by U.S. residents (line 2c). Included in this $3.4
billion of net inflow was a reported $3 billion in net U.S. sales of
foreign securities to residents of Japan. This inflow was not sustained
in November, however, as Japanese purchases of foreign securities in the
United States dropped to $0.7 billion and U.S. residents returned to being
net purchasers of foreign securities in November. For December
preliminary data on gross offerings indicate that U.S. corporations'
Eurobond offerings were down from the levels of October and November and
foreign bond issues in the United States rose to almost $2 billion,
suggesting a continuing drop off in the net capital inflows associated
with private securities transactions.
Banks reported substantial net inflows in October and November. (See
line 1 of the Summary Table of U.S. International Transactions.) The
bulk of these inflows seem to have arisen through transactions with banks'
own offices in foreign countries. In December banks reported additional
capital inflows from their own foreign offices and IBFs. (See line 1 of

IV-11
International Banking Data Table.) These inflows were concentrated at
fo eign-chartered banks at the end of the year and associated with high
end-of-year net federal funds lending by foreign-based banks, as well as
substantial increases in C&I loans.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
On January 30, the Commerce Department released preliminary
trade figures for December suggesting a deficit of $10 billion ($128
billion at an annual rate). This was only half the size of the deficit
initially reported for the month of November. Revised estimates for
November indicated a substantially smaller deficit, as shown in the
table below.

With the caveat that the December data are still subject to

billion (column 7 in the table on the next page), slightly larger than
in the third quarter.
Exports are estimated to have increased by about 4 percent in
the fourth quarter. About one-third of the rise was in agricultural
products, primarily soybeans to Japan (Brazil, an important source for
Japan, has a drought-induced shortage). The remaining increase was
fairly widespread -- in machinery (particularly computers), industrial

based on preliminary
supplies, automotive products, and consumer goods. During 1986, the
volume of nonagricultural exports is estimated to have risen 13 percent
(Q4/Q4); this compares with a less than one percent rise in volume
during the previous year. Increasing price competitiveness of U.S.
products arising from the decline in the dollar likely contributed to
this rise in export volume.
Nonoil imports increased by an estimated 4 percent in the
fourth quarter, with about one-third of the rise attributable to higher
prices. The increase in volume appears to have occurred almost
entirely in consumer goods and gold. The strength of U.S. consumption
during the past several quarters supported part of the rise in volume.

caused by increased trade tensions between the United States and
several large trading partners, which could result in the imposition of
various trade restrictions. Anticipation of other measures, such as
the Customs Service users' fee, may have also have resulted in a
temporary surge in imports.
The value of oil imports in the fourth quarter averaged about the
same as in the third quarter. A 10 percent decline in volume was offset
by an increase in price. From September to December the average price of
imported oil rose by an estimated $2 per barrel. Oil prices in spot
markets rose sharply following the announcement of the OPEC production
agreement, and remained firm through January as OPEC producers limited the
amount of their contract sales. The volume of oil imported in the fourth
quarter, while averaging less than in the third quarter, appears to
include further increases in stocks held in U.S. territories in the
Caribbean.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Industrial production in the major foreign industrial countries was
sluggish toward the end of last year. In Japan, despite a strong
increase in IP in December, the fourth-quarter average was 1 percent
below the third quarter and 1 percent below a year earlier. In Germany,
fourth-quarter production was also below the third quarter and only 1
percent above a year earlier. In most other foreign industrial
countries, production in October-November either stagnated or advanced
only moderately.
Inflation abroad has generally remained at low levels and 1986
fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter rates were significantly lower than in
the preceding year. Consumer prices fell in Germany and were virtually
unchanged in Japan over the year. The other West European countries
roughly halved their inflation rates in 1986.
Both Japan's and Germany's current account surpluses measured in
U.S. dollars have continued at record rates.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, industrial production
rebounded to grow 2.9 percent (s.a.) in December after declining 1.7
percent (s.a.) in November. Retail sales figures, which have tended to
suggest continued moderate strength in the consumer sector, rose 2.2
percent (s.a.) in November, but then declined 4.5 percent (s.a.) in
December. From 1985 Q4 to 1986 Q4, retail sales grew 5.4 percent. New
housing starts increased 3 percent (s.a.) in November to a level almost
18 percent higher than a year ago. The unemployment rate in December,
2.9 percent (s.a.), was slightly higher than its level in October and
November.

IV-20
Inflation remains very low in Japan. Tokyo consumer prices in the
fourth quarter were 0.1 percent above the fourth-quarter level in 1985.
In January, prices fell slightly to 0.6 percent below the January 1986
level. Wholesale prices were unchanged in December from their November
level. For the fourth quarter on average, wholesale prices were 10.5
percent below their year-earlier level.
December customs based trade figures recorded a surplus of $7.2
billion. This brought the total for 1986 to $82.5 billion. The
December current account surplus of $8 billion brought the 1986 total
to $85.5 billion, substantially above the 1985 total of $49.3 billion.
The Japanese cabinet has adopted a budget for FY 1987 that
maintains the generally austere fiscal stance that has characterized
recent years. In the General Account budget, total nominal expenditures
are essentially unchanged from those in the budget for FY 1986. In the
budget for the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program--the socalled "second"
official budget in which purely financial transactions are
deleted--spending on economic program is to increase 7.1 percent. The
tax and revenue portion of the budget contains the specific plans for
the tax reform package recently formulated. Personal income tax rates
will be lowered over two years, starting January 1, 1987, with interim
marginal tax rates for 1987 that are only slightly changed from previous
levels. The rates for central government corporate taxes will be
lowered over three years. Tax breaks for small savers will be ended
October 1, 1987, and a 5 percent value added tax will be levied as of
January 1, 1988. Overall the tax reform program is expected to be

IV-21
revenue neutral for FY 1987 as a whole, which starts on April 1, 1987.
The budget will be presented to the parliament in February.
German real GNP growth in 1986 was 2.5 percent, year-over-year,
according to provisional data published by the Federal Statistics Office.
The components of 1986 GNP growth consisted of relatively strong
domestic demand with private consumption and investment in equipment
growing over 4 percent and construction recovering from a very poor 1985
performance. The external sector represented a drag on growth as
exports of goods and services declined by 0.6 percent while imports rose
by 3.1 percent. The early release of GNP data was based on partial
information about the fourth quarter. Industrial production fell 0.8
percent in December, so that the fourth quarter was only 0.9 percent
above tie fourth quarter of 1985. The volume of new orders declined by
1 percent in November to a level 4.7 percent below a year ago. It is
noteworthy that not only foreign orders, which were 6.5 percent below a
year ago in November, but also domestic orders have been very weak
recently. The November level of domestic orders was 5.6 percent below
the third-quarter average and 3 percent below a year ago. The latest
surveys on the business climate indicate a decline in confidence. The
rate of unemployment was 8.8 percent in January, four-tenths of one
percentage point below a year ago.
Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in January to a level 0.8 percent
below a year ago. Import prices continued to fall in December and were
19.6 percent below a year ago. Wholesale and producers prices continued
to fall toward the end of last year.

IV-22
The current account surplus in December was $4.3 billion. The
cumulative surplus for 1986 was $36.4 billion compared with $13.9
billion in 1985.
Central Bank Money growth in December was 9.4 percent (s.a.a.r.).
This put the fourth-quarter average 7.9 percent above the fourth quarter
of 1985, compared with the Bundesbank's target of 3.5 to 5.5 percent.
M3, which had grown by about 7 percent (s.a.a.r.) in earlier months,
fell slightly in December.
Economic expansion in Canada continues to be moderate. Growth in
real domestic product was only 2-1/4 percent (s.a.a.r.) over the first
three quarters of 1986 compared to growth of nearly 4 percent over the
four quarters of 1985. More recently, industrial production declined
0.9 percent in November after increasing 1.4 percent in October and
still remains well below the average monthly pace set earlier in the
year. By the end of the year, unemployment was 9.4 percent. Consumer
prices increased 4.3 percent over the four quarters of 1986, about
unchanged from the previous year's inflation. On December 18, 1986, the
government proposed changes to the structure and regulation of banks and
other federally regulated institutions. The main policy proposals
included:
(1) provision for common ownership of banks, trust and loan
companies, life insurance firms, and investment dealers and a
broadening of powers with greater potential for "one-stop
shopping;"

IV-23
(2) arresting the growth of linkages between commercial interests
and non-bank financial institutions where commercial links
exist;
(3) a regulatory framework that will strictly control self-dealing
in all federally regulated financial institutions and create
new safeguards against the abuse of conflict of interest; and
(4) consolidation of the present divided responsibility for
supervising federal bank and non-bank financial institutions,
and measures to strengthen the effectiveness of federal
supervision.
These federal government proposals followed deregulation of the
securities industry in Ontario announced on December 4, 1986, allowing
banks, insurance companies and foreign financial institutions to become
active players in Ontario's securities market. As a result of these
policy actions Schedule B banks in Canada (foreign owned) and other
non-resident federally regulated institutions will be able to fully own
securities dealers in Canada by June 1988, and will be able to have a 50
percent share as of June 1987.
Noteworthy recent economic developments in other foreign industrial
countries include an early official estimate of French real GNP growth
in 1986 (year-over-year) at 2 percent, slightly higher than the growth
figure in 1985.
In Italy, the federal deficit in 1986 achieved the government's
target of 14.7 percent of estimated 1986 GDP. For 1987, the Italian
parliament has enacted a budget with a projected deficit of less than 13
percent of GDP.

IV-24
In contrast to the pattern of generally weak economic activity
abroad, manufacturing output in the United Kingdom rose at over a 6
percent annual rate in the three months to November, and retail sales
volume also grew strongly.
On January 30, the Swedish government imposed a price freeze
effective until further notice. Consumer prices in December were 3.3
percent above December 1985. But the government's target and the basis
for a two-year wage agreement had been 3.2 percent. Average hourly
earnings for industrial workers in November were 8.3 percent above their
year-earlier level.

IV-25
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Efforts are continuing to obtain commitments to the $7.7 billion
financing package for Mexico from banks that have been reluctant to
participate. The government of Brazil reached agreement with its Paris
Club creditors in January to reschedule $4.1 billion in 1985-86 arrears
and obligations due in the first half of 1987. Argentina has reached
agreement with the IMF management for a 15-month stand-by arrangement
for SDR 1.1 billion and is requesting an SDR 389 million drawing from
the Compensatory Financing Facility. In late December, Venezuela
received a 90-day rollover on maturities due during the first quarter of
1987 under its 1986 rescheduling agreement with its commercial bank
creditors; the rollover will allow discussions to continue on a revision
of the agreement covering $21.2 billion in restructured public sector
debt. The Philippines' Paris Club creditors agreed on January 23 to
reschedule $860 million in external debt over a ten-year period.
Ecuador is seeking to modify rescheduling agreements with commercial
banks and official creditors; its commercial bank steering committee has
agreed, in principle, to reduce interest rate spreads, defer principal
maturities, and change the interest payment schedule. Nigeria has
received final approval by the IMF Executive Board of its stand-by
arrangement with the Fund.
Individual Country Notes. Efforts are continuing to obtain
additional commitments to the $7.7 billion financing package for Mexico
from banks that have shown reluctance to participate. In December, the
IMF management determined that Mexico was in compliance with the
stand-by arrangement's quantitative performance criteria as of

IV-26
September 30, and the first conditional tranche of SDR 225 million was
disbursed before year-end. Mexico has virtually met the requirements
with respect to World Bank loans needed to release $4 billion of the
commercial bank financing package, once the loan agreement is signed.
Mexico's 1986 current account deficit is estimated at about $1
billion, substantially less than the $3.5 billion deficit that was
projected in July. There was some recovery in oil exports in the fourth
quarter of 1986, but the main factor behind the improvement was an
aggressive exchange rate policy. As a result, agricultural and
manufactured exports rose by $2-1/2 billion while imports contracted by
$2 billion. A decline in Mexican economic activity also aided current
account improvement. The strengthening of the trade position has
enabled the Bank of Mexico to add modestly to its international reserves
in recent months, even though the anticipated disbursements from the
commercial bank financing package have not yet occurred.
Real GDP is estimated to have fallen by about 4 percent in 1986,
and industrial production in the first 11 months of the year was 5.2
percent lower than in the same period of 1985. In December, consumer
prices rose by 7.9 percent and were about 106 percent above a year
earlier. Sharp increases in rates for electricity, water, and
telephone service were instituted in early January. The minimum wage
was raised by 23 percent on January 1, and further raises are expected
to occur every quarter.
In Brazil, the government is apparently now permitting price
adjustments of 15-25 percent for certain categories of goods whose
prices have been frozen since March 1, 1986, on condition that prices

IV-27
not be raised further over the next four months. The policy measures
adopted in late November (public sector price adjustments, new excise
taxes, a policy of exchange rate mini-devaluations, and tighter monetary
conditions) do not appear to have performed as the authorities had hoped.
The Brazilian government now appears to be groping for an appropriate
package of policy measures to attempt to reverse the deteriorating
economic situation.
The overnight interest rate for federal securities is in excess of
16 percent per month at present, signalling tight monetary conditions
and rising inflationary expectations. Inflation was 7.3 percent for the
month of December bringing inflation for 1986 (December over December)
to 59 percent. The trade surplus continued to be very low in November
and December, averaging only $140 million. The trade surplus for 1986
was $9.5 billion, compared with $12.5 billion in 1985. Real GDP grew by
an estimated 7.7 percent in 1986, a slight deceleration from the 8.3
percent figure posted in 1985.
Some adjustment of wages will probably be forthcoming since
inflation after the introduction of the Cruzado plan on March 1, 1986
has cumulated to about 22 percent. (Crossing the 20 percent threshhold
is supposed to lead to a catch-up adjustment in wages.)
The Paris Club agreed in January to reschedule $4.1 billion in
obligations due official creditors, comprising 1985 and 1986 interest
and principal arrears, penalty interest, and principal coming due in the
first half of 1987. Brazil is expected to start negotiations on
reschedulings with banks in the near future, and is likely to request
new money and the rescheduling of outstanding debt at reduced spreads.

IV-28
Argentina has reached agreement with the IMF management for a 15-
month stand-by arrangement for SDR 1.113 billion; the stand-by has not
yet been approved by the IMF Executive Board. Argentina is also
requesting an SDR 389 million drawing from the Compensatory Financing
Facility due to low world prices for Argentina's commodity exports. The
World Bank has announced that gross new commitments for IBRD lending in
1987-88 could reach $2 billion. Negotiations with commercial banks for
a new money package have not yet formally begun.
Real GDP grew 5-1/2 percent in 1986, following a decline of 4.4
percent in 1985. Inflation declined from its 1986 peak monthly rate of
8.8 percent in August to about a 5 percent monthly rate toward year-end.
Lower world grain prices and the lack of a compensating real depreci-
ation of the official exchange rate have led to weak incentives for
planting and production of Argentina's principal exports. The current
account deficit widened from $1 billion in 1985 to $2.6 billion in 1986.
In late December, Venezuela received a 90-day rollover on maturi-
ties due during the first quarter of 1987 under its 1986 rescheduling
agreement with its commercial bank creditors. The rollover will allow
discussions to continue on a revision of the agreement covering $21.2
billion in restructured public sector debt. Venezuela is seeking to
defer all but a small amount of amortizations due during 1987-88 under
the agreement and a reduction in the spread of 1-1/8 percent over LIBOR,
and has also raised the need for new money. In November and December,
Venezuela paid $666 million of the $750 million downpayment mandated
under the rescheduling agreement, and has announced that it will pay the
remainder in early 1987.

IV-29
In 1986, Venezuela registered 3 percent real GDP growth despite a
fall in oil export and public sector, revenues of 10 percent of GDP. The
current account moved into deficit by $2.2 billion, following a surplus
of $3.1 billion in 1985. Total reserves excluding gold declined by
about $4 billion to $6.4 billion. The fiscal deficit was 7.2 percent of
GDP in 1986, compared with a surplus of 4.6 percent of GDP in 1985.
The Philippines' Paris Club creditors agreed on January 23 to
reschedule $860 million in external debt over a ten-year period
including five years of grace. The agreement applies to all principal
and 70 percent of the interest falling due between January 1987 and June
1988. On January 27-28, at the Consultative Group meeting in Paris, the
Philippines requested approximately $2 billion in development aid from
its 13 official donors plus the World Bank, up from $1.4 billion in 1986.
Negotiations with commercial banks to restructure $3.6 billion in
external debt falling due in 1987-91 are expected to start later this
month. The banks agreed in mid-December to a three-month suspension of
principal payments due during the first 90 days of 1987 and extended the
$3 billion trade facility for six months from January 1, 1987.
Ecuador is seeking to modify rescheduling agreements with
commercial banks and official creditors. The commercial bank steering
committee has agreed, in principle, to reduce interest rate spreads,
defer principal maturities, and change the interest payment schedule
from quarterly to semi-annual payments. However, recent interest
arrears to banks may jeopardize completion of the package. Ecuador will
seek additional relief from the Paris Club in 1987, assuming that it

IV-30
reaches agreement with the IMF on reactivating its stand-by arrangement.
Ecuador has been out of compliance since end-September 1986.
On January 30, the IMF Board approved a SDR 650 million 14-month
stand-by arrangement, the first such program for Nigeria, upon a Board
finding of satisfactory commercial bank participation in a debt
restructuring package which includes $320 million in new money. The
Nigerian government has indicated that it does not intend to draw from
the IMF, having promised its people last year that it would not accept
an "IMF loan." Nigeria will also restructure $1.7 billion in
medium-term maturities and $2.5 billion in letters of credit in arrears
with commercial banks. A rescheduling of external payment arrears and
1987 debt service due official creditors was negotiated at a Paris Club
meeting in December 1986.
