The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic production and employment posted solid gains during the
first two months of the year. Although final demand, on balance, has
been sluggish, output apparently has been boosted by a substantial
accumulation of inventories, following the depletion of stocks that
occurred in late 1986. Price increases picked up in January, but much
of the rise probably reflects factors with only a temporary influence on
inflation.
Employment and Unemployment
The labor market reports this year have been robust. Nonfarm
payroll employment rose more than 300,000 in both January and February,
up from the 250,000 average monthly gain in the fourth quarter. In
addition, employers lengthened workweeks in most sectors. Altogether,
the index of aggregate production-worker hours for February exceeded its
fourth-quarter level by 1-3/4 percent.
By industry, much of the employment gain once again occurred in
finance and services, where increases continued to average more than 100,000
per month. In addition, hiring by retailers has been quite strong on
a seasonally adjusted basis after a relatively small rise during the
year-end holiday season. Morever, employment at construction sites jumped
more than 100,000 in January owing to unusually warm weather during the
survey week, and held steady at that elevated level in February. In
manufacturing, employment was up 50,000 in February, but much of that
rise was associated with the return to work of strikers at USX Corporation
and John Deere. Otherwise, there has been little net increase in factory

employment so far this year, after sizable gains in the fourth quarter.
Nonetheless, manufacturers apparently did stretch workweeks in February to
an average 41.2 hours, their highest level since 1966. As a result, the
February level of aggregate production-worker hours in manufacturing stood
1-1/2 percent above the fourth-quarter average.
The household survey appeared to confirm the strength in hiring
reported by businesses, as it showed employment rising more than 370,000
in both January and February. However, the sizable job gains in each month
were accompanied by large increases in the labor force, and the civilian
unemployment rate held steady at 6.7 percent.
Industrial Output and Capacity Utilization
Industrial output has expanded at more than a 4 percent annual rate
since September, after a lackluster performance during the first three
quarters of 1986. On balance, moderate output gains continued in January
and February, with some variation across sectors. Production of defense
and space equipment, as well as that of construction supplies, has continued
to advance strongly, building on the solid increases registered in 1986.
In contrast, total output of consumer durables has shown little net change
so far this year, as output of home goods (such as furniture and appliances)
fell back from its elevated late-1986 level, offsetting higher production
of motor vehicles. Output of business equipment moved up during the first
two months of the year. The 1 percent gain in February reflected stronger
production of both motor vehicles and farm equipment, the latter of which
advanced after the settlement of a strike at John Deere. However, output
of most other types of business equipment has remained weak in recent months.

In the materials sector, production edged up during January and
February, extending the pattern of modest advances during the second half of
1986. The settlement at USX in late January had little effect in February
on steel output, owing to a long start-up period after employees returned to
work. The bounceback in steel production, however, should be evident in
the March index.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities increased
0.2 percentage point in February to 79.8 percent. Since October of last
year, the overall operating rate is estimated to have risen 0.8 percentage
point, but remains little changed from the year-earlier level. Utilization
rates in most durable goods industries either have stabilized or advanced
somewhat after declining during the first half of 1986. A stronger turnaround
has occurred in the mining and utilities sectors, while the utilization rate
for nondurable manufacturing has continued to trend up at a modest pace.
With the stronger production gains of recent months, price increases
in the industrial sector have become somewhat more widespread. The producer
price index for intermediate materials less food and energy--a broad measure
of production inputs-rose 0.6 percent over the first two months of 1987
after two years of little change. In addition, various measures of commodity
prices (including those shown in the accompanying chart) are up substantially
from their lows of last summer, despite some easing on balance in recent weeks.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal personal income has expanded at a fairly robust pace so far
this year, boosted in large part by sizable increases in wage and salary
disbursements. Despite wide month-to-month swings, subsidy payments to

II-7
farmers also have contributed to the rise in personal income since year-end,
while cost-of-living increases for transfer payments roughly offset larger
personal contributions to social insurance.
Personal tax payments dropped sharply in January and a bit more in
February, providing a considerable boost to disposable income. BEA
estimated that the level of personal taxes in both months was reduced, on
balance, $15 billion (annual rate) by provisions of the Tax Reform Act
that have a permanent effect on payments. These provisions include the
reductions in tax rates and the elimination of various deductions and
credits. In addition, tax payments so far this year apparently have been
reduced by the underwithholding of taxes, because many taxpayers have
been slow to file revised W-4 forms. Although the extent of underwithholding
is hard to determine, BEA estimated that it decreased the level of tax
payments $20 billion (annual rate) in January; by February, enough revised
W-4 forms had been filed to shrink the amount of underwithholding to a
$10 billion rate. Even so, personal tax payments fell in February, as
the level of nonwithheld taxes--which had been raised in January by the
spurt of capital gains realizations late last year--returned to a more
normal level.
On balance, consumer spending in recent months has been relatively
flat, with month-to-month fluctuations heavily influenced by developments
in the auto sector. After plummeting in January, sales of domestic autos
have rebounded somewhat--averaging 7-1/4 million units at an annual rate
during February and the first twenty days of March. However, despite the
boost provided by the current round of sales incentives, first-quarter
sales are running well below the fourth-quarter pace.

Excluding motor vehicles, consumer spending since yearend has
registered moderate gains on balance, paced by the continued uptrend
in outlays for services. Nondurable expenditures also have advanced,
largely owing to increased February outlays for food. In addition, nominal
outlays for gasoline have risen markedly this year, but much of this
expansion represents higher pump prices. Nominal purchases of consumer
durables apart from motor vehicles dropped in January and then rebounded
sharply in February to a level 7-3/4 percent (annual rate) above the fourth
quarter average.
During the past two years, real consumer outlays have expanded at
about a 4 percent annual rate, roughly double the pace of real disposable
income gains. One factor behind the relatively bouyant pace of spending
has been the rising net worth of the household sector. Despite the rapid
accumulation of consumer debt, the net worth of U.S. households increased
more than $1 trillion during both 1985 and 1986, owing in part to the
runup in stock prices. Historical patterns suggest that the marginal
propensity to consume out of wealth is quite small-roughly a nickel of
consumer spending ultimately is generated by a $1 increase in wealth--
and that any rise in spending lags behind accretions to wealth. Even so,
the rise in net worth in recent years has been large enough to provide
considerable support to consumer outlays. Moreover, increases in household
wealth this year--the aggregate market value of common stock has risen
more than $600 billion so far in 1987-are likely to play a further
role in supporting consumer spending. Still, household debt burdens
remain substantial, and consumer spending gains may be tempered by

II-11
concerns about fluctuations in income flows and possible reversals in
stock prices.
Business Fixed Investment
Outlays for business fixed investment began the first quarter at a
sluggish pace. On the equipment side, shipments of nondefense capital
goods fell 7-1/4 percent between December and February. This decline
affected virtually every category of equipment and represents, in large
part, a "payback" from the tax-induced bunching of equipment purchases
at the end of 1986. Although the Census Bureau's recent revision of the
shipments data tempered the size of the January drop, tax incentives
still appear to have had a substantial effect on the timing of expenditures
around the turn of the year.1
Outlays for nonresidential construction (excluding petroleum drilling
activity) also declined in January, extending a downtrend that began in
early 1986. The presence of widespread excess capacity in the industrial
and commercial sectors has been the principal factor underlying this
contraction, with some contribution as well from the anticipation of adverse
tax changes for nonresidential structures. Compared with their most recent
peaks, the January levels of factory and office construction are down about
25 percent, while construction of hotels and other commercial buildings
1. Two distinct tax factors were responsible for the year-end swing in
equipment outlays. Most important, the depreciation provisions in force
between 1981 and 1986 encouraged firms to install equipment at the end of
their taxable year-which frequently coincides with the end of the fourth
quarter. In addition, this year's Tax Reform Act reduced somewhat the
front-loading of depreciation deductions for equipment installed after
1986, prompting some acceleration of outlays late last year to avoid this
change.

both have receded about 20 percent. Petroleum drilling activity, which
rebounded a bit last fall, has been relatively stable since then.
Near-term indicators of investment spending provide a mixed picture.
The average level of new orders for nondefense capital goods in January
and February stood 5-1/2 percent below the fourth-quarter average. The
sharpest decline occurred for aircraft and parts; in addition, bookings for
office and computing equipment continue to lag, possibly reflecting the
unsettled state of this market. In recent months, an unusually large
number of new workstations and mainframe computers has been introduced and
additional product announcements are widely anticipated. Until this turbulence
passes, computer orders are likely to remain sluggish. Bookings for other
types of machinery have risen only modestly, on balance, from the fourth-quarter
average, suggesting lethargic near-term outlays in these sectors as well.
For nonresidential construction, however, new commitments have firmed since
mid-1986, indicating that there might be a pause in the downtrend in this
sector.
For 1987 as a whole, survey readings still suggest that investment
outlays will be lackluster. Most recently, the McGraw-Hill winter survey,
conducted between late January and early March, indicated that firms expect
nominal spending to rise only 2 percent this year. Even so, this expectation
represents an improvement over the 1-3/4 percent decline in nominal
outlays estimated for 1986. Most of this pickup reflects the expected
stabilization of capital spending by petroleum and mining companies after
last year's plunge. There is some evidence, as well, of stronger spending
plans for several industries that could be benefiting from an improved trade
situation, including iron and steel, machinery, and textiles.

II-15
Inventories
Business inventories jumped in January after declining through much
of the second half of 1986. After a sharp drawdown late last year,
manufacturing and trade inventories rose at an annual rate of $87.2 billion
in constant-dollar term in January--the largest monthly increase in the
current expansion. This year-end swing was concentrated among stocks of
autos and wholesale machinery and reflects, in part, tax incentives favoring
the purchase of these items before the end of 1986. Apparently, this surge
in demand was met chiefly out of inventories, which then rose sharply once
sales dropped back in January.
Despite a sizable accumulation in January, particularly for finished
foods, manufacturers' inventories still appear to be on the lean side.
Indeed, stocks held by producers of durable goods actually have edged down
on balance since November. Moreover, a substantial share of the recent
rise in nondurable stocks has occurred in the chemicals industry, where
orders have been robust. A number of other industries-including producers
of home goods, construction supplies, defense and space equipment, paper,
and textiles-have augmented their stocks of materials and supplies and
lengthened their workweeks, moves that suggest a relatively optimistic
view of demand prospects and, possibly, the need for further stockbuilding.
Except for autos, trade inventories generally appear in line with
current sales. Inventory-sales ratios for most types of retail and
wholesale establishments in January remained within the range observed over
the past two years. In contrast, stocks at auto dealers appear bloated.
After sizable liquidations in November and December, these inventories rose

at a $38.8 billion annual rate in January, as sales slowed markedly.
Moreover, despite a new round of incentives, auto sales in February
evidently fell short of manufacturers' expectations, and dealers' stocks
rose further. At the end of February, auto dealers held about a 74-day
supply of passenger cars--well above the preferred 60-day level.
Housing Markets
Housing construction has been robust early in 1987. Led by strong
increases in the single-family sector, total private housing starts in
January and February averaged 1.83 million units at an annual rate, up
7 percent from the fourth-quarter pace. To some extent, the recent strength
in starts stemmed from unusually good weather conditions during January and
February in the Midwest, a region that accounts for about 16 percent of
national housing starts.
Nonetheless, residential construction appears to be firming apart
from the influence of good weather. Reflecting the underlying strength,
permit issuance rose about 1-1/2 percent on average in January and February
compared with the fourth-quarter level. This advance occurred even though
the number of permits issued jumped in December (and then fell in January),
as California builders rushed to avoid new fees applied to permits issued
after December 31.
In the single-family sector, housing starts were up 11 percent on
average in January and February from the robust fourth-quarter pace,
reaching the highest level since early 1984. Sales of new single-family
homes fell a bit in January, but the level remained 3 percent above
the average for the second half of 1986. Existing home sales dropped

in January after a tax-related surge in December; sales recovered to a
3.7 million unit rate in February, about in line with the level seen last
fall.
Multifamily housing construction, by contrast, has remained near the
reduced levels seen in the fourth quarter. The decline during the past
year in multifamily starts is in accord with the decidedly negative
market fundamentals for the sector. Rental vacancy rates in most regions
are at 20-year highs, the new tax environment is much less conducive to
investment in multifamily housing, and--reflecting these unfavorable
factors--builder assessments of current conditions for rental apartment
starts are quite pessimistic. Only in the Northeast region, where rental
vacancy rates have remained moderate, is the outlook for multifamily
construction somewhat more favorable.
Median new home prices rose 16 percent in January from the year-earlier
level, compared with the 9 percent gain registered in 1986. Much of the
increase last year reflected improvements in housing quality and changes
in the regional composition of sales. When adjusted for such changes,
new-home prices rose only 3 percent in 1986. Regionally, price increases
last year continued to be most rapid in the Northeast, where new home prices
jumped 20 percent after adjustment for quality change.
Federal Government
Monthly Treasury data through February point to considerably slower
outlay growth in fiscal 1987 than in preceding fiscal years. Indeed, total
outlays through the first five months of the current fiscal year are only
2 percent above the same period one year ago. Spending continues to
rise for defense, entitlement programs, and the FSLIC; but these increases

II-20
largely have been offset by reduced outlays for a variety of other domestic
programs by Congress last year and by lower net interest costs on the
national debt.
On the revenue side, receipts through February of fiscal year 1987
are running 6-1/2 percent above the level one year earlier. Despite the
recent declines in personal tax payments mentioned above, total receipts
are up from fiscal year 1986 largely because growth in nominal income has
enlarged the tax base. Also raising receipts a bit, corporations in December
paid the first installment on the retroactive repeal of the investment tax
credit (ITC). Looking ahead, corporate and personal final payments are expected
to surge in March and April, reflecting further payments related to the ITC
repeal and to the accelerated realizations of capital gains late last year.
State and Local Government
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments appear
to have been about flat so far this year. In January and February, the level of
employment in this sector matched its fourth-quarter average, and real outlays
for construction in January were little changed from the fourth-quarter pace.1
State legislatures have been preoccupied this year with their response
to federal tax reform. Most of the 40 states that have a personal income
tax link their tax base to the federal definition of adjusted gross income
or taxable income. For these states, the broadening of the federal tax
base will yield a "windfall" in state tax revenues. According to a survey
recently completed by the National Association of State Budget Officers,
1. The Census Bureau actually reported a sharp rise in January construction
activity conducted by state and local governments. However, because BEA
uses different seasonal factors, the staff's assessment is that real outlays
for January will be measured as little changed in putting together the GNP
estimates.

II-21
this revenue gain is expected to total $5-1/2 billion in 1988. However,
under current proposals by state governors, more than 80 percent of the
total windfall would be returned to taxpayers, leaving only a modest revenue
gain at the state level.
At least 20 of the states affected by federal tax reform are taking
this opportunity to overhaul their own income tax systems. To a large
extent, the proposed reforms are similar to those recently enacted at the
federal level, including reductions in tax rates, the use of fewer tax
brackets, and increases in the value of personal exemptions and standard
deductions.
Prices
Inflation picked up early this year, boosted partly by sharp
increases in energy prices. In January, the CPI rose 0.7 percent and the
PPI for finished goods 0.6 percent. However, the pace of inflation at the
producer level slowed in February to only 0.1 percent despite further
increases for energy.
Domestic energy prices have turned up sharply since the December OPEC
agreement. At the wellhead, prices of crude petroleum climbed about 20
percent in January and another 4-1/2 percent in February; prices of natural
gas also were up in both months. Similarly, the PPI for finished energy
goods advanced sharply early this year. At the consumer level, energy
prices rose 3 percent in January, and further increases are likely in the
next few months as the higher price of crude oil is passed through more
fully to consumers.

II-23
Food prices posted a sizable 0.4 percent increase in the January CPI,
as prices rose markedly for fruits, vegetables, and a number of other
categories. However, recent price developments at the producer level do
not suggest a significant boost to inflation from this sector in the near
term. The PPI for finished foods fell in both months, with large declines
for fresh vegetables, pork, poultry, and coffee. Moreover, the index for
crude foods was unchanged on balance in February after a three-month decline.
Retail prices also accelerated in January outside the food and energy
sectors, particularly for commodities--which were up 0.6 percent in the
January CPI. The increases were largest for tobacco products, home elec-
tronic equipment, and some other household categories; apart from tobacco,
these items are strongly influenced by import prices. Apparel prices
were up as well, apparently owing to less-than-seasonal markdowns.
The acceleration in the January CPI apart from food and energy may be
related in part to temporary factors. Consistent with this view, the PPI
for finished consumer goods less food and energy turned down in February.
Producer prices for cars and light trucks declined, reflecting the effects
of the latest incentive programs, while price changes in other categories
were about offsetting. In addition, part of the rise in the January CPI
may result from seasonal adjustment problems typically associated with
January clearance sales.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage inflation continued at a slow pace, on average, early this
year. The hourly earnings index for production and nonsupervisory workers
was up 0.5 percent in February after two months of little change. Much of

II-24
the overall rise was concentrated in transportation and public utilities
and in services, typically volatile components of the total index.
In the union sector, recent wage increases have continued at about
the pace seen throughout most of last year. The Bureau of National Affairs
reported an average first-year wage increase of 2-3/4 percent for contracts
negotiated during the first 10 weeks of 1987, compared with a 3 percent
increase for negotiations concluded during 1986. When lump-sum payments
are included, first-year increases so far this year have averaged nearly
3-1/2 percent. Most of these payments early in 1987 have been negotiated
in the manufacturing sector, where they contributed almost 1 percentage
point to the the median 3-1/2 percent first-year settlement.
Finally, revised data for the fourth quarter of 1986 now indicate
that productivity in the nonfarm business sector fell 2-1/4 percent at an
annual rate, a slightly larger decline than indicated in the preliminary
report. The fourth-quarter estimate for the rise in compensation per hour
also was revised down slightly, from 3 to 2-3/4 percent. As a result, unit
labor costs now are estimated to have risen 5 percent at an annual rate, the
largest increase last year. Nevertheless, unit labor costs rose only 2
percent for all of 1986, about 1-1/2 percentage points below the pace
during 1985. Within manufacturing, unit labor costs were unchanged in
1986, as relatively strong productivity gains offset increases in hourly
compensation.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have posted only small net changes since the
February 11 meeting of the FOMC. Indeed, by the standards of recent years,
the period has been one of remarkable calm in fixed-income markets.
Chairman Volcker indicated at the time of his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony
that the System's reserve-supplying posture was unchanged, and federal
funds have continued to trade for the most part within a range of 6 to
6-1/4 percent. Incoming economic data have been interpreted by private
analysts as unlikely to prompt a significant near-term shift in policy;
the more stable dollar after the G-6 meeting in Paris also contributed to
the general stability of the markets, but recent weakness has been viewed
as further circumscribing the System's easing options. Although the
international debt situation and problems of the Farm Credit System and
the FSLIC attracted considerable attention, they left only mild imprints
on the structure of rates.
Meanwhile, the stock market has continued to soar to new highs.
Major share price indexes have risen about 8 percent since February 11,
bringing the advance for the year to nearly 25 percent--or more than $600
billion in aggregate market value.
Though not a major factor shaping market sentiment, the recent
behavior of the monetary aggregates undoubtedly has been constructive
psychologically. After surging at the end of 1986, when transactions
were accelerated to beat tax law changes, M1 dropped sharply through mid-
January; a rebound during February still left the average level for the
month virtually even with that for January, and M1 growth was subdued
through early March. With the nontransactions component of M2 also flat

p-preliminaryGrowth from
Q4 1986 to
Feb. 1987P1986:04

III-3
last month, growth of M2 from the fourth quarter to February amounted to
6-1/4 percent at an annual rate-in the lower part of the Committee's 5-1/2
to 8-1/2 percent range for the year-and this aggregate likely is slipping
lower in its range in March. M3 growth through February was only a shade
stronger, at 6-1/2 percent, also in the lower half of its annual range.
Growth of debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have
slowed to an annual rate of around 9 percent in February, compared with
13-1/4 percent in January; the aggregate is still above its 1987 monitoring
range of 8 to 11 percent growth, but is moving closer to the upper level of
the range. The deceleration is attributable largely to a marked decline in
federal borrowing, as the Treasury runs down its large cash balance. State
and local bond issuance has remained moderate and disproportionately in the
form of advance refundings. Net business borrowing has fallen considerably
from the strong December pace, although long-term issues continue to be
substantial. Household borrowing appears to have remained strong, especially
in the mortgage category because of the strong housing market and the new
tax advantage over consumer credit.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 was little changed in February on a month-average basis. Demand
deposits contracted at a double-digit rate for the second straight month,
offsetting further the year-end surge, but the principal source of the
deceleration in M1 was a sharp slowdown in the growth of other checkable
deposits to an annual rate of 13-1/2 percent. OCDs have not grown this
"slowly" in some time, and with the data for early March pointing to only
a slight pickup, the pattern suggests the possibility that the heavy
shifting prompted by low opportunity costs may be winding down.

III-4
The flatness of M2 in February reflected primarily the weakness in M1
and the sharp decline in overnight RPs and Eurodollars. However, retail
nontransactions balances also grew more slowly in February. While savings
deposits continued to expand rapidly, small time deposits ran off for the
tenth straight month. In addition, there were outflows from MMDAs as their
rates remained a bit below rates paid on passbook accounts, which were
reduced only slightly further. Funds may have been drawn away from M2-type
instruments by the stronger inflows to bond and equity mutual funds; these
were very strong in January and appear to have continued so in February.
It also is possible that some individuals have responded to tax law changes
by paying down consumer credit with liquid balances. Despite the abundant
publicity about the frailty of many thrift institutions and of the FSLIC,
the thrift share of M2-type deposits has held up well thus far this year.
In broad terms, retail deposit patterns appear to have extended into March,
implying slow M2 growth this month.

M3 edged up in February, boosted by a continued substantial buildup
of term Eurodollar balances by U.S. residents and a resumption of inflows
to term RPs and institution-only money market funds. Large time deposits
fell as thrift institutions ran off CDs at a double-digit rate, relying

III-5
instead on borrowing from Federal Home Loan Banks. Data for early March
suggest that stronger issuance of CDs at banks has compensated for reduced
inflows to other non-M2 components, leaving M3 expansion sluggish.
Bank credit decelerated markedly in February as a broadly based
slowdown in loan growth was not fully offset by a rebound in securities
acquisitions. Banks continued to acquire U.S. government securities,
albeit at a reduced rate, and they boosted their holdings of other securi-
ties somewhat, after four months of declines. Much of the slackening in
total loan growth reflected an unwinding of the surge during the closing
weeks of 1986. Real estate lending slowed to a 12-3/4 percent pace in
February, about the rate evident during most of 1986; just before year-end,
both commercial and residential loans had been boosted as transactions took
place in advance of the repeal of the capital gains exclusion and changes
in depreciation schedules. Consumer loans were virtually flat last month,
possibly influenced both by tax reform and by the continued substitution
of home equity lines for outright consumer credit. Business loans showed
the sharpest slowdown, actually declining slightly on a month-average
basis after two months of extremely rapid growth.
Corporate Finance
Nonfinancial corporate borrowers moved to take advantage of the
lowest bond rates in more than nine years by lengthening their debt
maturities in February, and, especially, in March. Both bank loans and
commercial paper of nonfinancial borrowers declined in February and remained
weak in early March, while new bond offerings have risen sharply. This
month the volume of new issues by nonfinancial firms likely will be the
largest since last April, when rates were falling steeply. Average bond

maturities have been long in both of the last two months. The recent
increase in volume has been greater for industrial than utility issues,
suggesting that the major part of these offerings are not for refunding
purposes, since in 1986 the bulk of the refundings were utility issues.
The new issue volume has included an increase in low-grade offerings by
firms searching for more permanent financing of earlier mergers and LBOs.
Demand for lower-grade issues is still strong, with yield spreads between
investment and noninvestment grade bonds now close to last summer's pre-
LTV-failure lows. Bond issues convertible into equity or issues with
equity warrants also have been sizable in the past two months.
New equity offerings were very weak early in the quarter, but they
picked up as the stock market rally continued and will likely reach a record
volume this month. Merger activity appears to have receded somewhat after
the tax law changes at the beginning of the year, resulting in a smaller
amount of equity retirement; announcements of future acquisitions and share
repurchases have picked up recently, however.
Not sharing in the recent stock market gains were shares of large
banks with substantial exposures to Latin America. Most have lost 6 to
12 percent of their market value since Brazil's suspension of interest
payments in mid-February. Prices of some debt issues of large U.S. banks
also have suffered; in the Euro floating-rate market, notes with long
maturities have lost 2 to 4 percent in value partly because of Brazilian
loan concerns. General problems of illiquidity also have developed in
this market, after a series of collapses in the prices of perpetual
floating-rate note issues; among the principal factors have been increased
competition from floating-rate mortgage securities and increased concerns

III-9
regarding provisions in primary capital notes of banks that allow them to
withhold interest payments at times of financial difficulty.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The combined deficit of the federal government is projected to total
about $60 billion (NSA) in the first quarter of calendar 1987, $4 billion
less than in the last quarter of 1986. The Treasury is expected to finance
the bulk of this quarter's deficit by borrowing about $37 billion from the
public and by drawing down its cash balance by $14 billion.
Net issuance of marketable coupon securities should total about $37
billion. Unlike the last two quarters, when sales of bills raised a large
portion of new cash, auctions of regular weekly and monthly bills will
result in a sizable paydown this quarter. This paydown likely will be
partially offest by a cash management bill at the end of the quarter to
bridge the period until April tax revenues come in. The reduction in the
supply of bills has contributed to the downward pressure on bill yields
relative to other money market rates since the last FOMC; some precautionary
shifting of demand away from bank CDs also has been a factor.
Net issuance of nonmarketable debt is predicted to be down somewhat
this quarter, though still substantial at about $10 billion. The decline
is largely attributable to lower demand for Treasury savings bonds since
last November 1, when the guaranteed minimum rate was reduced from 7.5 to
6 percent. During the months immediately preceding the November 1 cut,
savings bond sales averaged $1.7 billion per month, while since December
sales have run about $800 million per month. The Treasury's issuance of
SLGS is almost unchanged, as advance refunding by state and local govern-
ments has been well maintained. A new floating-rate SLGS program-mandated

by the tax reform act--has proved to be unpopular, owing to the low interest
rate paid on the certificates, the requirement that investors use only the
regular or the new daily program, and certain other complexities of the
program; modifications are under consideration by the Treasury.
The federally sponsored credit agencies also have lower financing
needs and are expected to reduce their outstanding debt in the first quarter.
The Farm Credit Banks continue to pay down debt, owing to the weak overall
demand for loans by farmers and, to some extent, the loss of higher quality
borrowers to other lenders. Fannie Mae also is expected to repay debt; its
volume of mortgage purchases has declined, partly because mortgage originators
are selling more mortgage-related securities directly into the market, and
partly because the agency had advanced some of its planned borrowing from
early this year to late 1986, when it viewed market conditions as especially
favorable. In contrast, the Federal Home Loan Banks are expected to raise
about $2-3/4 billion in new cash in the first quarter.
The spreads between rates on some FHLB securities and those on
Treasuries have widened slightly in secondary market trading of late, but
the new securities priced in mid-March had spreads quite similar to those
for comparable maturities in recent months and somewhat below those early
last summer. Spreads against Treasuries for the securities of the Farm
Credit Banks widened after the release in February of their 1986 financial
statements. The six-month security of the FCBs, the most frequent issue of
these banks, carried a spread of nearly 50 basis points over bills at its
pricing in late February and has traded a little higher than that in the
secondary market; on earlier six-month issues, spreads were about 25 to 30
basis points.

III-12
Municipal Securities Market
Gross offerings of tax-exempt bonds totaled $8 billion in February
but in March are expected to be considerably higher, perhaps reaching the
average pace of issuance in 1986. Total tax-exempt offerings have been
boosted during the first quarter by a continued large volume of advance
refundings as public-purpose issuers take advantage of the relatively low
rates. In the first quarter, total refundings will account for well over
half of all new issues, a record share. The slowdown in borrowing to
raise new capital reflects increased restrictions under tax reform,
particularly the tightened volume curbs on private-purpose bonds. The
bulk of issues so far this year have been general obligation and revenue
bonds for public purposes, such as transportation and public utilities.

agricultural loans and industrial development, as well as for other
purposes for which tax-exempt bonds have been precluded under tax reform.
Mortgage Markets
Home mortgage interest rates have not changed significantly since
the last FOMC meeting. At 9.08 percent last week, however, the average
interest rate on commitments for 30-year fixed-rate conventional loans
(FRMs) at major lenders was nearly 30 basis points lower than in early
January and at its lowest level in nearly a decade. The average initial
rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) slipped 3 basis points
during the intermeeting period to 7.55 percent in mid-March, keeping the
spread between rates on FRMs and ARMs about unchanged from its size in
early February.
Interest rates on mortgages closed in early February fell 20 to 30
basis points from their levels at the beginning of the year, the sixth
consecutive monthly decline. Rates on FRMs fell more than those on ARMs,
which may help to explain the slight decrease in the proportion of mortgages
closed with adjustable-rate features in early 1987. Although ARMs accounted
for only about 30 percent of all home mortgages made in January and February,
they accounted for a much higher proportion of the loans made by thrift
institutions; within the S&L industry, West Coast associations have been
much more aggressive in their marketing of ARMs than those in the rest of the
country as a group, as measured by the offering of a discount or buy-down.

Drexel Burnham Lambert, with Executive Life the primary provider of GICs.
So far this year neither of these firms has been active in the market,
which has included Equitable Life Assurance Society, Hutton Group, Shearson
Lehman Holdings, and Prudential-Bache.

Among the factors affecting the ability of lenders to close ARMs is
their willingness to offer initial-year discount rates, or "teaser" rates,
on such loans. Of the ARMs closed in early February, 56 percent included
such a discount, up from 50 percent in January. It is thought that
substantial discounts are being offered less frequently now than when ARMs
were first marketed. There are reports that borrowers in some instances
may be "rolling over" ARMs in order to take advantage of these initial-year
discounts.
Even though residential mortgage borrowing remained strong, total
mortgage debt formation seems to have slowed a bit in early 1987 from its
very rapid-tax-affected-pace in the fourth quarter of last year. In
addition to the slowing of real estate loans at banks in February, mortgage
assets held at FSLIC-insured thrift institutions increased at a much slower
pace in January than in the preceding month. Moreover, loan originations
at FSLIC-insured thrifts totaled $20 billion in January, down sharply from
the $29 billion originated in December and the lowest volume of mortgage
lending activity at these institutions in nine months. Possibly reflecting
a general slowdown, the volume of new issues of federally related pass-
through securities has declined in each of the first two months of this year.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit showed little increase again in January.
Auto credit outstanding grew at only a 5 percent annual rate, while the
other types of installment debt together contracted at a 2 percent rate.
Part of the slowdown may be attributable to the incentive households have
to repay consumer debt, owing to the loss of full tax-deductibility under
tax reform. Many individuals apparently are paying down their consumer

loans by borrowing against lines of credit secured by home equity. Infor-
mation from surveys of both institutions and households suggests that as
much as half of this borrowing can be regarded as substituting in one way or
another for consumer loans.
Institutions continue to market home equity lines aggressively,
hoping to establish a customer base for this service that is viewed as
likely to involve a long-term relationship. In Atlanta, however, one of
the early hotbeds of home equity promotion, many lending institutions
reportedly have reinstated normal settlement charges.
Several measures used as indicators of debt repayment difficulties
on the part of consumers held steady during the fourth quarter. Delinquent
auto loans at finance companies edged down during the fourth quarter, and
past-due consumer loans at banks remained at 2.26 percent of the number of
loans outstanding (American Bankers Association series), squarely in the
middle of the range of the past 12 years. The ABA series for credit card
delinquencies stood at 3.18 percent of loans outstanding during the fourth
quarter of 1986, a slight decline from 3.23 percent during the third
quarter. However, that rate of delinquencies is considerably higher than
the average of 2.67 percent for 1985. Preliminary call report data through
the fourth quarter show that consumer loan writeoffs in 1986 were about a
third higher than in 1985.
Household delinquencies on first mortgage debt also declined a bit
in the fourth quarter, the Mortgage Bankers' series for loans past due 60
days or more falling to 1.86 percent, 0.15 percentage points below the
second-quarter record. Delinquencies remained higher than the average in
economically distressed areas, including oil-producing states of the South-
west and some heavily industrialized states in the Midwest.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
For much of the period since the previous FOMC meeting on
February 11 the dollar traded within narrow ranges against most G-10
currencies. During the past week, however, the dollar has come under
strong downward pressure -- particularly against the yen -- and
U.S. authorities have intervened in volume. On a
weighted-average basis, the dollar has declined about 1 percent from
its level on February 11. Against the yen, the dollar is down about 3
percent; against the mark, down only 1/2 percent.
During the early part of the intermeeting period, concern
about the likelihood of further international cooperation to stabilize
exchange rates dominated foreign exchange markets, and market
participants reacted strongly to reports of possible joint actions.
The announcement by G-6 authorities in late February of their intention
to "cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around
current levels" appeared to cause market participants to become more
cautious and seemed to contribute temporarily to reduced volatility
among the major currencies. The credibility of the G-6 agreement also
appeared to be enhanced by the market's perception that the United
States sold a small amount of dollars in early March when the dollar
rose above 1.87 DM/$.
Downward pressure on the dollar may also have been moderated
by data released during the intermeeting period that indicated weaker
growth prospects in both Germany and Japan. To help stimulate the
Japanese economy, on February 25 the Bank of Japan cut its discount

rate by 1/2 percentage point to 2-1/2 percent. In contrast, new U.S.
data revealed a mixed picture, but on balance suggested a somewhat more
favorable oudlook for the U.S. economy.
Following the weekend of March 21-22, downward pressure on the
dollar intensified as concern heightened about deterioration in U.S.-
Japanese trade relations. Treasury Secretary Baker's comments
indicating that no target zones for currencies had been established at
the February G-6 meeting also may have been an influential background
factor.
the dollar fell rapidly through 150 yen/dollar to a low of 148.40
yen/dollar on March 24 before recovering slightly. The Desk intervened
with small sales of yen on March 23 and much more strongly thereafter,
selling a total of $823.2 million worth of yen during the three days,
divided evenly between the System and the Treasury.
Before the recent emergence of selling pressure on the dollar,
the principal exception to the general pattern of stable currencies had
been the U.K. pound. Sterling, which moved up by almost 6 percent
against the dollar during the intermeeting period, drew support from
favorable fiscal developments revealed in the annual budget speech on
March 17. The firming of the pound allowed the Bank of England in mid-
March to cut its money-market dealing rates in two steps by a total of
a full percentage point; commercial banks' base lending rate were
reduced by a similar amount to 10 percent.

IV-4
During the intermeeting period, the Canadian dollar rose
about 2-1/2 percent and the Swedish krona gained 2 percent. Reflows
into EMS currencies other than the mark intensified during the
intermeeting period, allowing some countries to rebuild reserves that
had been depleted prior to the EMS realignment in January.
Several EMS countries also took advantage of the opportunity
provided by strength in their currencies to reduce official interest
rates. On March 9, the Bank of France cut both its money-market
intervention rate and 7-day repurchase rate by a quarter point to 7-3/4
and 8-1/2 percent, respectively; on March 14, the Bank of Italy reduced
its discount rate by 1/2 percentage point to 11-1/2 percent. The
interest rate on short-term Treasury certificates in Belgium was
lowered in two stages in mid-March by a total of 35 basis points to 7.4
percent, and the Danish overnight rate was cut by 50 basis points to
10-1/2 percent on March 17.
With these official rate reductions, foreign short-term
interest rates moved down during the intermeeting period by about 10
basis points on a weighted-average basis, while U.S. short-term
interest rates gained about 10 basis points. The differential between
U.S. and foreign long-term interest rates also moved in favor of the

IV-5
dollar, as foreign long-term interest rates declined somewhat more than
did U.S. rates.

IV-6
U.S. bank lending to foreigners in the fourth quarter. In
nominal terms, U.S.-chartered banks' claims on foreigners rose $4.2
billion in the fourth quarter, including a $400 million increase in
claims on non-OPEC developing countries. After adjustment for the
effect of a 2.9 percent decline in the exchange value of the dollar on
the dollar value of nondollar claims, total claims at constant exchange
rates are estimated to have been about unchanged. For 1986 as a whole,
claims on foreigners increased $3.6 billion in nominal terms and
decreased approximately $6 billion at constant exchange rates.
The nominal value of claims on non-OPEC developing countries
fell by $5.0 billion during 1986. There was a mixed pattern of small
increases and decreases in claims on Latin American countries, creating
an overall reduction of $0.6 billion (less than one percent) for the
year. During 1985, unadjusted claims had declined $3.1 billion, or
approximately 4 percent. In contrast, claims on the Asian and African
non-OPEC developing countries declined $4.3 billion in 1986, a 14
percent reduction in claims on these countries. This followed a
decline of roughly 10 percent in 1985.
The divergence of experience across African and Asian non-OPEC
developing countries is striking. Claims on Taiwan increased by $0.4
billion in 1986. This amounted to an increase of nearly 10 percent,
and restored the level of gross U.S. bank claims on Taiwan to levels
approaching those maintained from end-1982 until mid-1985. This
increase in gross bank claims, however, occurred at the same time that
Taiwan's external assets were also increasing. Official external
assets alone (other than gold) increased by roughly $24 billion (110
percent) in 1986. In contrast during 1986, claims on the Philippines

fell slightly, while claims on much smaller debtors such as Malaysia
and Thailand continued a longer-term decline.
U.S. bank claims on Korea declined $2.6 billion, or nearly 30
percent in 1986. Almost all of the decline occurred in the third and
fourth quarters. The decline apparently reflects the decision by the
Korean authorities to use roughly one half of the 1986 Korean current

IV-8
account surplus of $4.7 billion to reduce external bank debt. It is
somewhat surprising that the reduction in U.S. bank claims on Korea is
nearly equal to the estimated net capital outflow recorded in the
Korean balance of payment statistics for 1986. This suggests that
Korean net repayments were used largely to retire U.S. bank debt.
There are competing explanations for this phenomenon. Korean
authorities may have viewed U.S. bank debt as having a high cost, and
repaid this debt first when feasible. Alternatively, U.S. banks may
have been unwilling to maintain their share of the Korean debt market
at prevailing interest rate spreads for Korean obligations. Since
Korea is the largest developing country borrower from U.S. banks that
does not presently face debt service problems, it is thus possible that
U.S. banks now intend to reduce exposure to those countries where they
are free to do so.
During 1986, U.S. bank claims on OPEC countries, Eastern Europe,
and the smaller developed countries declined, continuing a trend that
began in 1983. Three-fourths of this decline took place in the fourth
quarter. Claims on the offshore banking centers rose by a small amount
($0.2 billion) in 1986. At the same time, claims on the G-10 countries
rose $11.1 billion (7 percent), although as much as $9 billion of this
increase may have been attributable to the effect of the decline in the
value of the dollar.

IV-9
U. S. International Financial Transactions
, ther was only a small increase recorded in
G-10 official reserve assets in the United States. (See line 4 of the
Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.)
Preliminary information from the FRBNY indicates relatively
modest increases in G-10 official holdings in the United States in
February.
Banks in the United States reported over $12 billion in net
inflows between the end of December and the end of January. (See line
1.) These inflows were more than accounted for by a reduction in claims
of U.S.-based banks on their own foreign offices in financial centers
abroad. However, when viewed on a monthly average basis, the net inflow
from own foreign offices was substantially smaller and slowed in
February. (See line 1 of the International Banking Data table.) The
large Eurodollar inflows into money center banks in January substituted
for other sources of funds that showed sharp declines, particularly
demand deposits.
The Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbank residents continued to
climb in January and February, mostly in the form of Eurodollar CDs held
in custody by U.S.-based banks in London. (See line 3 of the
International Banking Data table.) These CDs, however, are not
necessarily the liabilities of the custodian bank. Detailed reports on
the balance sheets of London branches of U.S. banks are not available

yet, but information from the Bank of England indicates that CDs
outstanding at the London branches of U.S. banks increased by a bit over
$1 billion in January, far less than the increase in custody holdings.
In 1986 custody holdings of CDs for U.S. nonbanks increased at
the same time that CDs issued by U.S. banks in London declined. It
appears that much of the increase in U.S. nonbanks' holdings of
Eurodollars in 1986 was in the form of CDs or other deposits issued by
foreign banks. Foreign-based banks, particularly Japanese-based banks,
have become more active in raising funds in the Euro-CD markets. In
contrast, U.S.-based banks appear to have reduced their reliance on
brokered funds such as Euro-CDs, while their holding companies have
increased their issuance of bonds and notes in the Euromarkets.
Net inflows through private securities transactions (line 2 of
the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) moderated in
January, reflecting the decline in new issues of Eurobonds by U.S.
corporations at the end of 1986. New issues dropped further in January,
but picked up again in February and March. Attracted by the booming
U.S. stock market, foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks remained
high in January. Also in January, private foreigners sold net almost $3
billion in U.S. Treasury securities, following similar net sales in the
fourth quarter of 1986 (line 3).
The Department of Commerce has released data for the fourth
quarter of 1986 on other capital account transactions. Foreign direct
investment in the United States (line 7) jumped to a record level in the
fourth quarter (over $14 billion), bringing the total for the year to
$25.6 billion. Many takeovers and mergers were bunched at the end of
the year, before the effective date of the new tax law. Investors from

IV-13
Western Europe accounted for almost $19 billion of the total, while
Japanese investors accounted for about $5 billion. U.S. direct
investment abroad (line 6) continued to be inflated by the depreciation
of the dollar, and in particular by the impact of unrealized currency
translation gains on reinvested earnings. The statistical discrepancy
in the U.S. international transactions accounts climbed to $27 billion
in 1986, indicating that substantial amounts of current and capital
account transactions continue to be missed by current reporting systems.

Current Quarter Data
Data on merchandise trade for the month of January released at
the end of February suggest a trade deficit of $177 billion (annual
rate) for that month, on a not seasonally adjusted CIF value basis (See
table and chart). These data are preliminary and subject to
substantial revision. Nevertheless, they suggest a worsening of
exports for the month of January, which has been attributed to the
harsh winter both here and abroad. Revised data for December, released
with the January figures, indicated a larger deficit for that month
than first estimated (see table).

As a result, the monthly data will tend to be somewhat less volatile
and more reliable as an indicator of underlying trends than has
previously been the case. Nevertheless, some volatility in the monthly

data can be expected to remain, partly because they still will not be
seasonally adjusted.
Merchandise Trade: 1986
The merchandise trade deficit widened slightly in the fourth
quarter of 1986, to $153 billion at an annual rate, on a revised
seasonally adjusted balance of payments basis (see table). Although
the deficit in the fourth quarter was somewhat larger than for any of
the three previous quarters of 1986, the data do suggest some levelling
off of the deficit since the end of 1985.
During the fourth quarter of 1986, nominal exports grew about
3 percent, with roughly one-third of the increase in agricultural
exports and the remaining two-thirds in non-agricultural products.
Soybean exports (primarily to Japan) were particularly strong in the
fourth quarter, as production in Brazil (a major Japanese supplier)
was reduced by a drought. The increase in non-agricultural exports was
not concentrated in any one major category; exports of capital goods
(particularly business machines), automotive vehicles and parts, and
consumer goods all contributed to export growth in the fourth quarter.
Over 1986 as a whole, the value of exports rose almost 9
percent with the bulk of this growth concentrated in exports of non-
agricultural products. The growth in non-agricultural exports appears
to have been related to improvements in price competitiveness due to
the depreciation of the dollar, as prices of non-agricultural exports
fell 3 percent between the fourth quarter of 1986 and the fourth
quarter of 1985. Moreover, little of the improvement in exports can be
explained by rising foreign demand, as real GNP growth in foreign

IV-17
industrial countries eased somewhat in 1986 (Q4/Q4) and growth in
developing countries was only marginally improved.
The increase in the value of non-agricultural exports over the
four quarters of 1986 appears to have been concentrated primarily in
consumer goods and certain capital goods (computers, machine tools and
aircraft). Exports of industrial supplies also rose, though more
moderately. Exports to Western Europe increased about 40 percent over
this period, and exports to Japan rose about 20 percent in value terms.
Exports to developing countries were essentially unchanged during 1986,
while exports to Canada rose sharply on a Q4/Q4 basis but were
unchanged over the year.

Analysis, and
The value of total imports increased roughly 3 percent in the

as increases in oil prices were offset by declines in import volume.
However, between the fourth quarter of 1985 and the fourth quarter of
1986, the value of oil imports fell substantially owing to the sharp
decline in the price of imported oil, which was partly offset by an
increase in import volume (see table). The spot oil price, which had
rebounded somewhat during the latter part of 1986, remained firm in
January, but eased somewhat in February due to slackened demand. These
prices picked up again in early March as OPEC producers cut back
production somewhat, and have been in the $18.50 per barrel range for
light crude oil in recent weeks.

Price increases accounted for about one-third of the rise in
non-oil import value during 1986 as a whole (Q4/Q4), and about half of
the increase in the fourth quarter. By the end of last year, price
increases resulting from the depreciation of the dollar were evident
across all categories of imported products, with the strongest
increases coming in consumer, automotive and capital goods
(particularly nonelectrical machinery).

IV-19
The increase in non-oil imports came primarily from Japan and
the newly industrializing countries of Asia (NICs), as imports from
other developed and developing countries either declined or increased
only slightly. Imports from the NICs were little affected by
exchange rate movements as their currencies, on averge, have not risen
against the dollar. Moreover, the relative strength of U.S.
consumption demand in 1986 supported strong growth of consumer goods
imports in particular from these countries.
Current Account: 1986
The current account deficit increased somewhat in the fourth
quarter of 1986 to reach $147 billion (seasonally adjusted annual
rate). The current account registered a deficit of $141 billion for
the year as a whole, worsening by $23 billion over the 1985 figure
(see table). For 1986, the change in the deficit was primarily due to
the changing trade balance as other components in the current account
showed only minor changes. Between 1985 and 1986, the increase in
portfolio income payments (due to rising net interest payments on a
growing U.S. net international debt position) was offset by increased
net direct investment income receipts and other net service inflows
associated with the decline in the dollar.

Developments in the Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries
remained generally weak in the fourth quarter of 1986. In particular,
real gross national product fell in Germany, and while the Japanese
economy grew somewhat, unemployment reached a historical high at the
beginning of 1987. The overall current account surplus of the foreign
G-7 countries was $123 billion in 1986, $60 billion larger than in
1985. Germany and Japan nearly doubled their surpluses, and Italy
moved sharply into surplus. Industrial production and unemployment
data in January indicate that activity abroad is weak everywhere but in
the United Kingdom. In keeping with the spirit of the G-6 meeting in
Paris at the end of February, several of the foreign industrial
countries announced, in late February and March, discount rate cuts and
plans for tax reductions.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, real GNP grew by 3.2 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter of 1986, bringing overall growth to
2.5 percent in 1986, with domestic demand increasing by 4 percent. In
the fourth quarter, consumer spending declined 2.7 percent while
imports actually fell by 11.2 percent. Rising unemployment in 1987
suggests that the weakness in consumer spending may continue. Although
exports fell by 4.8 percent, gross fixed investment was a sector of
vigorous economic activity; it grew by 9.1 percent, with investment in
machinery and equipment being particularly strong. Current surveys,
however, do not suggest that this strength will continue.
Other recent indicators of economic activity were also mixed. In
January, industrial production (s.a.) fell and the unemployment rate
reached 3 percent. In the fourth quarter of 1986, new machinery orders
(s.a.), both foreign and domestic, were quite strong. Retail sales

rose 4.5 percent (s.a.) in January, reversing a December decline. New
housing starts in January were 10.3 percent higher than their year-
earlier level.
Both consumer and wholesale price inflation remained negative in
January and February. The current account surplus was again a record
in January. In February, however, export volume was 0.9 percent
(n.s.a.) lower and import volume 1.6 percent (n.s.a.) higher than their
year-earlier levels.
On February 23, the Bank of Japan reduced its discount rate to 2.5
percent. At the G-6 meeting, officials pledged to make efforts to
obtain parliamentary approval of the FY 1987/1988 budget, including
provisions for tax reform. Approval of the budget has been delayed by
political opposition to the introduction of a sales tax. Prime
Minister Nakasone has requested that the Economic Planning Agency begin
formulating another program to encourage domestic economic activity.
German real GNP fell 0.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter.
Exports fell 6.3 percent, and imports rose 10.4 percent. Domestic
demand grew 4.8 percent, owing mainly to strong inventory accumulation.
Private and public consumption stagnated.
In January, industrial production fell sharply. The volume of new
orders fell to a level 4.8 percent below its year-earlier level.
Foreign orders were 6.7 percent and domestic orders were 5 percent
lower than they had been a year ago. There is evidence that exporters
have sharply reduced their orders of capital goods.
On March 9, the government announced new tax measures in the wake
of the G-6 meeting. A tax cut of DM 5.2 billion, equivalent to 0.25
percent of 1986 GNP, will go into effect on January 1, 1988, as will
accelerated depreciation allowances for small businesses. These new

IV-26
measures will be in addition to the earlier tax reductions of DM 8.4
billion, due to take effect at the same date.
In France and Canada, the pace of economic activity at the end of
1986 was weak. Industrial production (s.a.) in France fell in
January, and in Canada real GDP (s.a.) grew only slightly in the fourth
quarter. French unemployment was 10.9 percent in January, quite high
by historical standards.
In the United Kingdom, recent data indicate comparatively strong
activity. Real GDP growth was 2.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth
quarter, and the data were revised upward for the first three
quarters of 1986. Unemployment declined for the seventh consecutive
month in February.
In the first three weeks of March, the central banks of France, the
United Kingdom, and Italy lowered the discount or money market
intervention rate. The British government announced its fiscal 1987
budget on March 17. The budget was relatively expansionary; it
includes a slight reduction in the marginal tax rate on personal
income. The projected level of the public deficit is unchanged from
that for 1986, with expected tax receipts based upon the official
forecast for continued strong activity. The current monetary target
for MO was retained, whereas the HM3 target was discontinued. The
French government proposed a major reform of the stock exchange, ending
the monopoly on trading shares enjoyed by current stockholders; the
government's goal is to liberalize trading completely by 1992. The
government of Italy fell on March 3; it is likely that early
Parliamentary elections will be held this spring.

IV-27
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
On February 20, Brazil suspended interest payments on medium- and
long-term debt to commercial banks pending agreement on rescheduling
with the banks and the provision of new loans. The Brazilian trade
surplus declined sharply during the course of 1986 and the government
still appears to be groping for a coherent set of policies. The Mexi-
can commercial bank financing package began to be signed on March 20.
Following a catastrophic earthquake in March, Ecuador has suspended
most debt service payments for the rest of the year. In response to an
upsurge in inflation, Argentina has instituted a package of economic
measures including a four-month wage and price freeze. In late
February, Chile and Venezuela reached agreements with their bank credi-
tors to reschedule amortization obligations during 1987-88 and 1987-89,
respectively; to reduce interest spreads (though not to the Mexican
level); and, for Chile, to reschedule interest payments in lieu of new
money. Progress was also made in the Philippine negotiations to
reschedule $3.6 billion in commercial bank debt.
Individual Country Notes. In late February Brazil suspended
interest payments on about $68 billion in medium- and long-term debt to
foreign commercial banks, pending agreement with banks on a debt
rescheduling and the provision of new loans. Soon after, Brazil froze
about $15 billion in short-term credit lines with banks, but said it
would continue to pay interest on those lines. Brazil is continuing to
service its debt to official bilateral and multilateral creditors.
The Brazilian authorities still appear to be groping for a
coherent set of policies to reduce inflation and strengthen the exter-
nal sector. Interest rates have been kept higher than the inflation
rate over the last couple of months and the exchange rate has been

IV-28
devalued broadly in line with inflation in January and February.
However, the loss of competitiveness sustained between March and
December 1986 has not been reversed. The sharp rise in inflation over
the last few months has automatically triggered almost monthly
increases in wages. Strikes and other signs of labor unrest have
increased as lagged adjustments to wages have resulted in at least some
decline in real wages.
Consumer prices rose 16.8 percent in January and 13.9 percent in
February. The trade surplus remained at the low level of the last
several months, recording monthly surpluses of $129 million and $261
million in January and February. (In 1984, 1985, and the first eight
months of 1986, the trade surplus averaged about $1 billion per month.)
Preliminary indicators suggest that the growth in economic activity so
far in 1987 has decelerated sharply from the 8 percent average growth
rates recorded in 1985 and 1986.
The Mexican commercial bank financing package began to be signed
on March 20, with a number of the smaller banks still not willing to
participate. Efforts are continuing to obtain commitments from these
banks. Mexico completed repayment of the $1.1 billion official portion
of the $1.6 billion bridge loan on February 13; repayment of the $500
million commercial bank portion, which was due January 30, has been
extended. The next tranche of the IMF stand-by arrangement will not be
available until a program review, currently underway, is completed and
specific quantitative performance criteria for 1987 have been estab-
lished. Additional steps in the program to relax trade restrictions
were implemented in early March, in accordance with the schedule agreed
upon with the IBRD. Treasury bill rates eased somewhat in early March
and deposit interest rates, which had not been changed since the end of

IV-29
September, were lowered slightly on March 9 and again on March 16.
Consumer prices rose by 7.2 percent in February and were about 110
percent above a year earlier.
Ecuador suspended most debt service payments for the rest of the
year following a catastrophic earthquake in March that killed hundreds
of people and caused what is expected to be a four-month interruption
of oil exports. Oil revenues account for nearly half of Ecuador's
export receipts and government revenues. The loss of oil exports plus
additional oil import requirements could cost Ecuador more than $500
million in 1987. Repair of the trans-Andean pipeline will cost at
least $100 million, and perhaps as much as $350 million. Negotiations
with the commercial banks and with the IMF for a stand-by program are
in abeyance while the scope of the damage is being assessed. Possible
emergency funding from the World Bank, IDB and IMF, as well as
supplemental assistance from the United States, is being explored.
Consumer prices in Argentina increased by 7.6 percent in January
and by 6.5 percent in February, following a 4.7 percent rise in
December 1986. In response to this acceleration of inflation, the
government implemented a new package of economic measures in late
February including a currency devaluation to be followed by exchange
rate pegging against the dollar, a catch-up wage increase to be
followed by a four-month wage and price freeze, and increases in
cigarette taxes and gasoline prices. The move is seen as an attempt to
put a lid on inflation before the September 6 congressional and
gubernatorial elections. In mid-February the IMF Board approved
Argentina's compensatory and stand-by loans, conditional on a new money
package from commercial banks and further rescheduling from commercial
banks--on which discussions are now underway. Argentina's failure to

IV-30
complete bilateral agreements with all of its Paris Club creditors
under the terms agreed in January 1985 is creating an impediment to a
proposed Paris Club rescheduling of 1987 maturities.
Venezuela reached an agreement in late February with its commer-
cial bank creditors that amends its February 1986 $21.2 billion public
sector restructuring arrangement. The amendment reduces scheduled
amortization payments during 1987-89 from $3.4 billion to $1.35
billion, extends final maturity by two years to 1999, and lowers the
spread from 1-1/8 to 7/8 percent over LIBOR. Despite the agreement,
government officials anticipate the need for a substantial new money
package from the banks in 1987.
Chile has recently reached agreement with its Bank Steering
Committee regarding a restructuring for 1987-88. The main components
of the agreement include a repricing of existing debts, reducing the
interest rates from 1-3/8 over LIBOR to 1 to 1-1/8 over LIBOR; a switch
from semi-annual to annual interest payments; and a request for a Paris
Club rescheduling of 1987-88 maturities.
The Philippines resumed negotiations with its commercial bank
creditors on March 3 to reschedule $3.6 billion in external debt
falling due in 1987-91. The Philippine objective is to obtain a low
spread over LIBOR, comparable to Mexico's. On March 20 the bank
advisory committee accepted as one part of an overall package an
innovative Philippine offer containing three alternatives for the banks
to receive the interest spread, of which the main one was to have an
underwriter guarantee a cash payment equal to 7/8s of the face value of
special peso-denominated Philippine Investment Notes used to pay the
interest spread if there is no buyer in the secondary market.
Negotiations continue on other matters.
