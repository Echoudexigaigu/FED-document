The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent indicators suggest that output is continuing to expand at
a moderal rate, albeit with only spotty improvements in the industrial
sector. Wage inflation has remained relatively subdued, but price
increases have accelerated. The rise in inflation reflects adjustments
to higher crude petroleum prices as well as some apparent dollar-related
price hikes in imported goods.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor demand grew at a brisk pace in April. In the household
survey, employment jumped almost 470,000, and unemployment recorded an
unusually sharp over-the-month decline. As a result, the civilian
unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent. After holding steady throughout
much of the second half of last year, joblessness has declined more than
1/2 percentage point since last November, and last month reached its lowest
level in the current expansion.
Nonfarm payroll employment increased 3'6,000 in April. Excluding
government, where revisions are frequently large, private industry jobs
were up almost 260,000 last month, somewhat above the average increase in
the first quarter. Aggregate hours of production workers edged off a bit
in April, associated in large part with the observance of religious
holidays during the survey reference week, which lowered the average
workweek.1 Nonetheless, total hours worked by production workers have
risen at nearly a 4 percent annual rate so far this year.
1. This decline was particularly noticeable in manufacturing, where the
factory workweek declined 1/2 hour and aggregate hours fell 1.0 percent
last month. Such a decline is generally consistent with the pattern that
has been observed on previous occasions when Good Friday fell during the
survey reference week.

Payroll employment gains in 1987 have been concentrated in service-
producing industries, continuing the trend seen throughout most of this
expansion. The number of jobs in finance and services increased about
100,000 per month in the first quarter and rose another 140,000 in April,
while in trade, employment advanced more than 70,000 last month, about the
same pace as in the first three months of the year. In contrast, hiring in
manufacturing, on net, has been quite slow, although early in the year
employers lengthened workweeks to meet higher production levels. In April,
manufacturing employment was little changed, as further cutbacks in
transportation equipment about offset small gains in other industries.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production registered a 2.6 percent (annual rate) increase
in the first quarter as a whole, but output was down in March, and the
decline appears to have extended into April. While the sharp drop in
production workers' hours last month should be discounted somewhat because
of the holiday effects, available physical product data--especially on
assemblies of motor vehicles--suggest a further drop in overall industrial
production last month.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal personal income-picked up sharply in the first quarter, growing
at an average monthly rate of $20.4 billion, about twice the fourth-quarter
pace. The higher first-quarter income growth reflects a sizable swing in
interest income as well as larger gains in wages and salaries. The month-
to-month movements in income were dominated by wide fluctuations in subsidy
payments to farmers, but over the quarter as a whole, these payments made
virtually no net contribution to personal income growth. Although transfer

payments grew with cost-of-living allowances, these were largely offset by
increases in personal contributions to social insurance.
Disposable personal income was boosted last quarter by special tax
effects. Personal tax and nontax payments fell sharply in the first quarter,
reflecting a combination of factors related to the new tax laws. Increases
in nonwithheld taxes early in the quarter-related in part to the year-end
bulge in realized capital gains-tended to raise these payments, but were
more than offset by reductions in personal tax rates and underwithholding
of tax liabilities. On average, the decrease in tax and nontax payments
contributed $8.6 billion per month to disposable income growth during the
first quarter.
Unit auto sales improved during the middle of the first quarter,
and continued to edge up in March and April. Real consumer spending fell
slightly in the first quarter, as a tax-induced decline in automobile sales
early in the year more than offset the gains in outlays for other goods
and services.
Excluding sales at automotive dealers, as well as gasoline stations
and hardware stores (the "retail control" group), nominal retail spending
rose 0.4 percent in April. Although the March level was revised down
substantially, sales at the retail group in April still were 1.0 percent
above the first-quarter average.
With consumption growth falling short of gains in disposable income,
the saving rate during the first quarter rebounded to 3.6 percent, a bit
below the 1986 average of 3.8 percent and well below the post-war average
of about 7 percent. The NIPA measured saving rate is expected to be excep-
tionally low in the second quarter, as disposable income growth in April

was held down by large tax payments resulting from capital gains realized
in 1986.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment was estimated to have fallen at about
a 13 percent annual rate in the first quarter, reflecting widespread declines
in outlays. On the equipment side, last quarter's decline in spending was
concentrated in January and followed a tax-induced bunching of purchases
in late 1986. While substantial, this first-quarter "payback" was only
half as large as the one that occurred a year earlier, which followed the
rush to lock-in the investment tax credit. In February and March, demand
for nondefense capital goods stabilized, and purchases of motor vehicles
recovered. In contrast, the decline in outlays for nonresidential
construction excluding petroleum drilling that occurred in the first quarter
extended the downtrend that began in early 1986.1 This continued weakness
reflects widespread excess capacity in the industrial and commercial sectors,
and to a lesser extent, adverse effects of tax law changes for nonresidential
structures.
Indicators of prospects for investment spending provide a mixed
picture. Excluding the volatile aircraft group, new orders for nondefense
capital goods were little changed in the first quarter, and, overall,
orders show no sign of emerging from the flat pattern that has prevailed
since mid-1984. For nonresidential construction, however, new commitments
have firmed since mid-1986, suggesting some pause in the downward adjustment
1. About half of the 23 percent first-quarter decline estimated in the
preliminary GNP report likely will be revised away, as the recent report
on construction put-in-place contained sharp upward revisions to nominal
outlays in January and February.

of this sector. For 1987 as a whole, survey readings still point to
lackluster investment outlays. The most recent Commerce Department survey,
conducted between late January and early March, indicated that firms expect
nominal spending to rise only 3 percent between 1986 and 1987. Much of
this increase reflects the expected stabilization of capital spending by
petroleum and mining companies. However, the Commerce survey also points
to stronger spending by several other sectors, including industries that
could be benefiting from the lower value of the dollar, such as iron and
steel, machinery, and textiles.
Business Inventories
After a sharp depletion in December and a massive accumulation in
January, business inventory investment, on balance, apparently returned to
a more moderate pace in the latter part of the first quarter. Increases in
stocks at auto dealers' accounted for most of the $28 billion annual rate
rise in nonfarm inventories estimated by the BEA in the first quarter.
Physical unit data from industry sources indicate that domestic dealers'
stocks of new cars increased to a near-record high of 1.8 million units by
the end of March, and the bloated inventories have prompted automakers to
trim assembly schedules well below the first-quarter production rate of
7.9 million units. Plans now call for assemblies to run at a 7-1/4 million
unit annual pace this spring, and then to move down to a 7.0 million unit
annual rate in the third quarter. Preliminary data indicate that dealers'
stocks began to edge down in April; if current sales rates are maintained
and automakers meet scheduled production rates, stocks should be drawn down
gradually to more manageable levels by the end of the model year.

II-13
In manufacturing, the sharp fluctuations in inventory investment
around the turn of the year left the stock situation little changed on
balance, and at the end of the first quarter, inventories in most industries
still appeared lean by historical standards. Factories have remained con-
servative in their stocking decisions so far this year; non-auto production
decelerated in the first quarter, and factory inventory accumulation,
especially at the raw materials stage, remained moderate. In the trade
sectors, non-auto retail inventories were essentially flat over the first
two months of the year, and wholesale inventories on a current cost basis
were little changed in both February and March.
Housing Markets
Total private housing starts receded a bit in March after rising
considerably during the winter. For the first quarter as a whole, total
starts averaged 1.81 million units, the same as their average pace during
1986. Single-family housing starts registered a robust 1.27 million unit
annual rate in the first quarter, and sales of new single-family homes were
at a strong 710,000 unit annual rate. This vigorous pace of activity was
supported by further declines in mortgage interest rates, which reached a
nine-year low towards the end of March. Subsequently, mortgage rates began
to climb, and for fixed-rate loans, increased almost 1-1/2 percentage
points by the end of April. Although construction data for April are not
yet available, trade sources have reported that the spurt in rates had only
a small effect on home sales and construction. However, if mortgage rates
maintain their current higher levels, housing activity would likely moderate
noticeably in coming months.
Multifamily housing starts were little changed in March at a level one-
fourth below the early 1986 peak. This weakness continues to reflect the

Federal Government
The federal deficit in March--the latest available Monthly Treasury
Statement-was $28 billion, $2.1 billion less than a year earlier. For the
fiscal year to date, the deficit was about $14-1/2 billion below year-
earlier levels. In April, the deficit likely plummeted. Outlays appear
to have remained on a fairly steady path-in part held down last month by
the long-awaited sale of Conrail-while receipts soared with the sharp rise
in individual nonwithheld tax payments following the April 15 tax date.
Daily data show April collections about $20 billion above last year, in
large part reflecting increased taxes on capital gains realized at the
end of 1986 to take advantage of lower rates under the old tax law and
favorable conditions in securities markets.
On balance, a sizable decline in the federal deficit from the 1986
fiscal year record seems in train, but a number of offsetting forces leave
the exact magnitude in considerable doubt, and make it misleading to
extrapolate the part-year results to a fiscal year total. Tax receipts
from capital gains income may be reduced later this year to the extent that
some of the stepped up capital gains realizations in 1986 were borrowed
from 1987. After accounting for the boost in receipts owing to the retro-
active repeal of the investment tax credit, it appears that corporate tax
receipts through April have been a little below the expectations of some
analysts. A catch-up could occur after the Treasury issues complete regu-
lations for the new tax law, but the full implications of that law for

corporate tax receipts in the 1987 fiscal year remain very uncertain.
On the spending side, timing shifts in Medicare and military pay schedules
could lower spending more later this year, but outlays for deposit insurance
could rise sharply if congressional action were to lead to a change in
FSLIC policy toward the closing of troubled institutions.
In action on the 1988 fiscal year budget, the House and Senate have
passed similar versions of the congressional budget resolution. A House-
Senate conference committee is currently working out differences between
the two budget proposals. The House and Senate proposals each call for about
$36 billion of deficit reducing actions, about evenly split between new
tax revenues and outlay cuts. The estimated deficits in the two budget
plans are both a bit less than $135 billion if CBO economic and technical
assumptions are used.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
rose at a 3.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, only a little less
than the rapid 4.6 percent advance in 1986. Most of the first-quarter
growth in outlays was for construction projects, while state and local
employment was little changed.
It appears that the state and local sector as a whole incurred a
sizable deficit in its operating and capital accounts in the first quarter,
the first such shortfall since early 1983. Fiscal problems have been
widespread; in order to avoid deficits in fiscal 1987, 28 states are
proposing tax hikes while 23 states are expected to cut their general funds

II-18
budgets in coming months.1 Even with these adjustments, the general funds
surplus is expected to total just $1.6 billion in fiscal 1987, with half of
the surplus accruing to New Jersey and California. This deterioration in
the surplus brings aggregate balances down to just 0.8 percent of planned
expenditures in fiscal 1987, the lowest ratio in ten years.
Prices
Inflation rates have been higher so far this year, reflecting both
the rebound in energy prices and a pickup in the prices of goods other than
food and energy. In March, both the CPI and the PPI for finished goods
rose 0.4 percent. Over the first three months of 1987, the CPI rose at a
6.2 percent annual rate following an increase of 2-1/2 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1986; the PPI exhibited a similar acceleration, picking up to a
4.6 percent annual rate of increase in the first quarter of this year.
Energy prices. Much of the recent pickup in the CPI and PPI reflects
the rise in crude petroleum prices around the turn of the year in the wake
of the December 20th OPEC accord. Boosted by strong increases early in
the quarter, the PPI index for consumer energy items surged over the
first 3 months of the year while the CPI energy component increased at a
26 percent annual pace. At the retail level in March, the CPI for energy
items increased 1 percent. However, the PPI for finished energy goods
edged off a bit in March and-with crude prices relatively stable,
suppliers' margins firming, and petroleum product stocks near seasonal
norms--it appeared that the adjustment of producer and retail energy prices

to the year-end rise in crude oil prices was largely completed by the end
of the first quarter.
Food prices. After several months of declines, food prices picked up
a bit in the March PPI, reflecting higher prices for fruits and vegetables
as well as significant increases for livestock prices in the crude food
index. In contrast to the PPT, the CPI for food declined slightly in March,
its first monthly decline in the past year. Although an April surge
in spot market livestock prices suggests some upward pressures on meat
prices in the near term, producers are expected to boost output more rapidly
as the year progresses, and futures markets for hogs and cattle point to
price declines later this year.
Prices excluding food and energy. Excluding food and energy items,
the CPI rose 0.5 percent in March and at more than a 5 percent annual rate
over the first three months of this year. The first-quarter acceleration
occurred in the goods component, where prices were up at about a 5 percent
annual rate, a marked pickup from the 1-1/2 percent increase in 1986.
Although sharp hikes in apparel and used car prices accounted for much of
this acceleration, more rapid price increases were quite widespread among
other consumer goods, and in part, appear associated with higher import
prices. Inflation in nonenergy services continued near its 1986 pace of
5-1/4 percent in the first quarter.
Other measures indicate that prices paid by U.S. importers have
continued to rise in lagged response to the drop in the exchange value
of the dollar. According to the preliminary estimates of the BEA fixed-
weighted indexes, prices of non-oil imports were up 6-1/4 percent between
the first quarter of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987 after increasing

only 2-1/4 percent over the preceding four quarters. Rapid increases con-
tinued over the year for some consumer goods, such as autos and photographic
equipment, whose prices had begun to move up in 1985. In addition, sharp
increases in the prices of clothing and non-auto capital goods imports have
been observed recently.
At the producer level, domestic capital equipment prices have shown
little net change so far this year, as declines in motor vehicle prices
associated with manufacturers' incentive programs largely offset moderate
increases in other categories. At earlier stages of processing, however,
prices of domestically-produced intermediate materials other than food and
energy have begun to pick up in recent months, rising at a 3.4 percent annual
rate during the first quarter. The acceleration reflects a sharp rise in
prices of industrial chemicals and some other petroleum-related materials as
well as substantial increases in a number of other materials categories.
Commodity prices. After generally declining for more than two years,
spot commodity prices began moving higher in the latter part of 1986 and
have risen noticeably since March. The depreciation of the dollar and the
associated rise in inflation expectations probably have been among the
influences pushing commodity prices higher this year, although the timing
and extent of price increases have varied considerably according to condi-
tions in specific markets. Since the last Greenbook, striking increases
have occurred in the markets for precious metals, and prices also have
risen for a number of industrial commodities, livestock, and most other
agricultural products. In contrast, oil prices have been relatively
stable following the big advance around the turn of the year, although oil

markets may be somewhat unsettled over the next month due to speculation
concerning the outcome of OPEC's next scheduled meeting in June.
A variety of popular commodity price indexes also have shown signi-
ficant increases since late March and for the year to date. These include
indexes that focus primarily on industrial materials, such as the Journal
of Commerce index, and those that are more heavily-weighted toward agricul-
tural commodities, such as the Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures
prices.
Wages and Labor Costs
Despite falling unemployment and the pickup in price inflation in the
first quarter, available measures of labor costs as yet show little sign of
acceleration in wage inflation. Hourly compensation, as measured by the
employment cost index (ECI), which is based on a survey of employers' costs
for fringe benefits as well as wages and salaries, rose 3.1 percent in the
12 months ended in March, about the same as the year-over-year changes in the
second half of last year. The rate of increase in wages and salaries
alone continued to about match the rise in compensation. By industry,
the gap between the rates of increase in the manufacturing and non-manufac-
turing sectors widened in the first quarter, as factory pay increases were
relatively small early this year.. By occupation, increases for white-collar
workers, at 3-3/4 percent, continued to outpace those of their blue-collar
counterparts by a large margin. Separately, the hourly earnings index for
production and nonsupervisory workers rose 0.2 percent in April, about the
same as its first-quarter average and similar to the trend in blue-collar
wages reported in the ECI.

Workers in the unionized sector continue to receive quite small pay
increases. As measured by the ECI, these workers saw average compensation
adjustments of just 1.6 percent over the past year. Separate data on
collective bargaining activity under major contracts (1,000 or more workers)
confirm the continuance of small first-year wage adjustments in the first
quarter, averaging just 0.9 percent in the first contract year and 1.7
percent annually over the life of the contract. In addition, average
deferred wage adjustments negotiated in earlier contracts have continued to
shrink. As a result, despite a slight increase in the size of COLA payments
owing to recent pickups in the CPI, overall union wage inflation--as measured
by the effective wage change series--slowed to a 1.6 percent annual rate in
the first quarter of 1987 from a 2-1/4 percent pace in 1986.
Preliminary data for the nonfarm business sector indicate that pro-
ductivity rose 1.7 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, reversing
a 1-1/2 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1986: this peculiar pattern
of productivity growth largely reflects the erratic movement of hours of
self-employed workers over the last two quarters. Reported growth of
compensation per hour was inexplicably low last quarter, posting only a
0.1 percent rise--a sharp contrast with the other data on wage trends
discussed above.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
In often volatile markets, most interest rates have moved sharply
higher and the yield curve has steepened appreciably since the March 31
FOMC meeting. The runup in rates appears to have been sparked by the
announcement of trade sanctions by the United States and concerns about the
implications of developments on the external side for domestic inflation
and financial pressures. Bond traders tended to take their cue from
movements in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, particularly
against the yen (see chart on page 111-2); in this context, the Chairman's
confirmation of "snugging" by the Federal Reserve actually prompted a brief
market rally. But more recently, as the yen-dollar ratio stabilized,
traders found cause for alarm in a sharp rise in commodity prices.
Longer-term bond rates have risen roughly a percentage point on
balance over the intermeeting period, and larger increases have been
recorded on home mortgages. Meanwhile, private short-term rates have
increased 3/8 to 3/4 of a percentage point-and short-term Treasury bill
rates are about unchanged on net, owing to a contraction of available
supplies and perhaps some enhanced preference for quality and liquidity.
The reduced supplies of Treasury bills in trading accounts added to the
difficulties encountered in providing reserves to offset the effects of
an unexpectedly large increase in Treasury cash balances after the April
tax date; federal funds traded for a time above 7 percent before easing
in the last few days to around 6-3/4 percent. Commercial banks raised
their prime loan rate twice, in quarter-point increments, but its spread
over other short-term rates remained unusually narrow. Broad stock price
averages ranged widely and ended the period little changed on balance.

The marked weakness in the monetary aggregates that developed after
year-end was interrupted in mid-April by a bulge in transaction accounts
as individuals prepared to make larger than usual tax payments, presumably
related to capital gains realized late last year. M1 growth jumped to an
18 percent annual rate last month; increases in M2 and M3 also were larger,
but April growth at a 6 percent rate left these aggregates slightly below
their annual target "cones."
Although the jump in interest rates in April led in some instances
to a deferral of planned borrowing, debt growth overall appears to have
been maintained at around the average pace of the first three months of
the year. Rather than cutting back its borrowing, the Treasury has let
the massive influx of tax revenues enlarge its cash balance. In other
sectors, perhaps the most noteworthy development has been a shift in the
composition of financing-away from stocks and bonds and toward bank
loans and commercial paper by businesses, and, reportedly, away from
fixed-rate and toward adjustable-rate mortgages by households.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Financial flows have been significantly distorted in recent weeks by
unusually large payments on nonwithheld personal taxes. Many individuals
evidently chose to realize capital gains in 1986 before less favorable
treatment under tax reform took effect, and nonwithheld tax payments in
April were around $20 billion above the year-earlier level. The most
striking monetary effect was at the M1 level, as people added to their
balances to cover checks mailed to the IRS. Both demand deposits and
other checkable deposits accelerated sharply; by late in the month, the
tax checks had begun to clear and the M1 buildup started to unwind.

The step-up in M2 growth in April was due almost entirely to the
greater strength in M1, as expansion of its nontransactions component
remained quite sluggish. MMDAs ran off sharply over the second half of
last month, apparently depressed in part by tax payments. Such accounts,
however, have displayed an underlying weakness for several months, and
their rates remain a bit below those on savings accounts and only a
quarter of a percentage point above the average yield on NOW accounts.
Since last autumn, moreover, MMDA rates also have become less attractive
relative to those on money market mutual funds.1 Small time deposits con-
tinued to run off in April, as rates paid on them have lagged the recent
climb in market rates and remain low relative to yields on more liquid
retail deposit instruments. Although money market mutual funds likely
also were drawn down to pay taxes, the weakness appeared less than seasonal.
In general, liquid M2-type instruments may have been boosted last month
by investors shifting away from sometimes chaotic equity and bond markets;
anecdotal evidence suggests that flows into equity and bond mutual funds
were noticeably weaker in April than earlier this year. Savings deposits
continued to show exceptional strength, advancing at a 30 percent pace in
April as their rates have remained relatively attractive.
M3 growth picked up last month primarily on the strength of its
M2 component. Institution-only MMMFs posted a substantial decline,
likely because their yields lagged the upturn in market interest
rates, and term Eurodollars reversed the pattern of recent months by
1. See table on page III-6. Perhaps reflecting these unfavorable
interest-rate relationships, the number of MMDA accounts at commercial
banks is estimated to have declined between November and February, the
first time this quarterly series has shown a decline.

registering a large drop. While large time deposits at banks surged,
those at thrift institutions contracted for the eighth consecutive month.
Some large thrifts reportedly have decreased their reliance on CDs in
favor of RPs on mortgage-backed securities as well as commercial paper and
medium-term notes issued through their holding companies; such nondeposit
instruments do not incur FSLIC insurance assessments. Despite the con-
tinuing news of the FSLIC's problems, S&Ls generally seem not to have
experienced runs on insured deposits; however, some troubled institutions
in the Dallas and San Francisco FHLB districts are said to be having
difficulty placing uninsured liabilities and are relying instead on FHLB
advances, which have increased nearly $20 billion over the last year. By
contrast, commercial banks stepped up CD issuance last month to fund
stronger asset growth and to pay back borrowings from their foreign
offices.
Bank credit accelerated in April to a 13 percent annual rate of
growth, reflecting a pickup in both loans and securities holdings.
Holdings of U.S. government securities--which include federally related
mortgage-backed securities--rose for the first time since January as
heavy purchases by small banks more than offset runoffs from the trading
accounts of large banks. Banks also added to their holdings of other
securities, with small banks again accounting for the bulk of the increase.
Within the other-security category, available data indicate that in recent
months large weekly reporting institutions have continued to run off tax-
exempt securities but have stepped up their purchases of private, taxable
securities such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs).

The faster loan growth at banks in April reflected a turnaround in
business lending as well as an increase in consumer lending and a jump in
security loans. The bulge in security loans likely reflected an accumulation
of inventories of securities at nonbank dealers. The increase in consumer
lending appears to have been concentrated around midmonth, suggesting that
a portion of the heavy tax payments was financed with bank borrowings.
Real estate lending-which includes takedowns under home equity lines--grew
at a 16-1/4 percent rate, only slightly below the strong pace of the first
quarter.
Corporate Finance
Total borrowing by nonfinancial firms appears to have slowed in
April and shifted toward shorter-term markets. Deteriorating market
conditions prompted a plunge in bond and stock offerings by nonfinancial
businesses to the lowest level since October 1985 and well under the March
high. At the same time, net issuance of commercial paper by such firms
surged to $2-1/2 billion in April, reversing virtually all of the decline
experienced earlier this year. As a result, the sum of business loans
plus commercial paper rose at an 8-1/4 percent rate in April, after
contracting in the previous two months.
Credit growth over the first four months of the year continued to
be boosted by merger-related demands as stock retirements from acquisitions
and share repurchases remained high, albeit below the inflated level of
late last year. Increases in interest rates on low-grade bonds lagged
those on investment-grade debt during most of April, and "junk bonds"
accounted for an unusually large share--about half--of gross public
offerings by nonfinancial firms.

A decline in share prices over much of April led to a substantial
drop in equity issuance from March's record pace. Offerings by financial
firms--which tend to be particularly responsive to short-run swings in
market conditions-fell to their lowest level since October 1985.
Initial public offerings also declined sharply in April from high
first-quarter levels. A few of the IPOs this year have been by firms
that previously had been purchased by private investors in leveraged
buyouts; these "reverse LBOs" accounted for about 10 percent of IPO
volume in the first quarter of 1987.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The deficit of the federal government is expected to total only
about $2 billion in the second quarter of calendar 1987, the smallest
in six years. The more-than-seasonal drop is attributable primarily to
the surge in receipts of personal nonwithheld taxes, but the broadening
of the business tax base under the new tax code also should increase
estimated corporate tax payments in April and June.
The Treasury is expected to borrow $26 billion from the public this
quarter, raising its cash balance about $20 billion to a quarter-end level
of almost $30 billion.1 As it did last quarter, the Treasury is maintaining
the recent pattern and size of note and bond auctions while paying down
large amounts of bills. About $38 billion of new cash is likely to be
raised through coupon issues, including $16-1/2 billion in the usual
midquarter refunding, about $2 billion more than last quarter. Issuance
1. The staff projection assumes that the debt ceiling will not disrupt
Treasury debt management. Under current law, the debt ceiling of $2.3
trillion will drop to $2.1 trillion on May 15; the staff estimates that
the Treasury cash balance would be depleted on May 28 in the absence of
a legislative remedy or unusual extra financing before May 15.

of non-marketable debt is anticipated to garner about $7 billion this quarter,
most of it obtained from SLGS. SLGS issuance had been maintained by strong
state and local refinancing activity in March and early April, but has
been falling off more recently in response to a reduced pace of refunding
issues.
Net borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies in the second
quarter is expected to total $5-1/4 billion, after a paydown of more than
$2 billion in the first quarter. The Home Loan Banks, which were the only
major issuer in the first quarter, should continue to play a prominent
role, owing to robust demand for advances by S&Ls. Fannie Mae is raising
a small amount of new funds in the second quarter; its borrowing is
expected to remain light over the remainder of the year, as a large pro-
portion of mortgage originations likely will continue to be securitized.
The Farm Credit Banks, facing weak demand for loans by creditworthy
borrowers, continue to reduce their outstanding debt, with a second-quarter
paydown close to the average for 1986. Despite the reduced presence of
the FCBs in the market, investor concerns about the solvency of the Farm
Credit System have lifted spreads on the most recent 3- and 6-month
issues to about 75 basis points over Treasury securities, compared with
about 60 basis points at the previous pricing in late March.1
1. In late April the Farm Credit System released information that its
losses were expected to remain substantial through the end of the decade,
and in early May it testified before Congress that it would need $6
billion in federal aid to remain viable.

III-14
Municipal Securities Market
Issuance of municipal securities slowed in April in response to
escalating interest rates. Gross tax-exempt bond volume is estimated at
$6-1/2 billion, less than half the March figure. Around $1-3/4 billion
in scheduled long-term offerings, primarily refunding bonds, were post-
poned or cancelled during April. Reduced long-term issuance was partly
offset by a seasonal surge in offerings of short-term tax-exempt debt,
mainly tax anticipation notes issued by New York State.

Tax-exempt bond yields jumped more than a percentage point in April
before easing a bit near month-end. Pressures in the tax-exempt market
were exacerbated by investors attempting to reduce holdings at a time
when dealer inventories and the forward calendar of new issues were
already sizable. Reportedly, long-term bond funds liquidated as much as
several billion dollars in tax-exempt bonds during the week ending April 16,
as many investors redeemed shares and the funds themselves restructured
their assets to secure a larger cash position.

III-15
Mortgage Markets
Rates in both the primary and secondary mortgage markets increased
in April by more than yields on Treasury bonds of comparable maturity,
as investors put a greater premium on liquidity and also reevaluated the
prepayment risks inherent in mortgage instruments. The average contract
rate on 30-year fixed-rate conventional mortgage commitments increased
about 1-1/2 percentage points to 10-1/2 percent in early May, reversing
much of the decline that had occurred since mid-1986. Moreover, the rate
ceiling on mortgages guaranteed by the Veterans Administration was raised
from 8-1/2 percent to 9-1/2 percent in mid-April and then to 10 percent
in the past week. In the secondary market, the extent of the rise in
rates depended on the yields paid by the underlying mortgages. For
example, yields on GNMA mortgage pass-throughs with 8 percent coupons
rose more than a percentage point, about in line with those on 10-year
Treasuries, while yields on 11 percent GNMAs rose only about 3/8 of a
point, as primary mortgage rates moved to levels that will act to
discourage prepayment of the underlying higher-coupon mortgages. The
initial rate on new commitments for one-year ARMs increased only about 30
basis points during April and early May, pushing the initial rate spread
between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages up almost 115 basis
points, to nearly 2-3/4 percentage points.
Preliminary data indicate that growth in mortgage lending in the
first quarter of 1987 slowed to a 10 percent annual rate, well below the
rapid clip of late last year. Residential mortgage debt increased
about 11 percent, down from the last quarter of 1986 but about in line
with growth in previous years. The growth in commercial mortgage debt,

III-16
by contrast, fell well below the pace of recent years; commercial real
estate transactions had jumped in the closing months of last year to
avoid the adverse impact of tax changes. Mortgage market participants
report that the volume of residential lending dropped off considerably in
April in response to the backup in interest rates and that by midmonth
the share accounted for by ARMs had risen.

p--preliminary.
Gross issuance of CMOs increased in April from an already very
strong first-quarter pace. Nearly all of the issuers of fixed-rate CMOs
in March and April have opted for REMIC tax treatment. Another relatively
new mortgage-backed security that has gained some importance in the
secondary market is a stripped mortgage pass-through, where principal
and interest payments are stripped and sold as separate discount securities.
The price of the principal-only securities falls when interest rates
rise, as payments are discounted at a higher rate and the slower expected
rate of prepayment pushes principal payments further into the future.

III-17
However, the value of the interest-only securities increases as market
interest rates rise, owing to the expectation that more interest payments
will be received, since the underlying mortgage is likely to remain out-
standing for a longer period of time.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding was virtually unchanged in March
after an annual rate of growth of only 2 percent in February. Revolving credit
fell, while automobile lending was up only slightly, and all other consumer
credit rose at a 2-1/2 percent rate. For the first quarter, installment debt
rose at only a 1-1/4 percent rate, well below even the sharply reduced fourth-
quarter rate. Excluding auto loans, consumer credit has increased at less
than a 1 percent annual rate for two consecutive quarters.
Only five other episodes of sluggish consumer credit growth lasting
as long as the recent one have been observed over the past two decades.
Four of these occurred during recessions and the other during the "mini-
recession" of 1967. Consumer debt behavior in the current episode un-
doubtedly is reflecting in part the tax law changes that provide greater
incentives to finance expenditures by drawing down assets or through
mortgage borrowings; in addition, more fundamentally, the deceleration
may be a consequence of the magnitude of prior debt accumulation.
In the latest entry into the nascent market of securitized consumer
loans, Bank of America sold off a $400 million package of revolving credit
loans in March. Previous entries have been mainly auto loans at finance
companies and some small test marketings by banks. Estimates put the out-
standing volume of issues to date, including private placements, at around
$15 billion, about 2 percent of total consumer installment credit outstanding.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
As shown in the upper panel of the chart, the dollar was quite
volatile in the period since the March 31 FOMC meeting, rising
intermittently with rumors and official statements suggesting that
central banks might act vigorously to defend the dollar, and falling as
expectations were not fulfilled. The U.S. currency was bolstered at
various times by reports that central banks were making efforts to
strengthen their abilities to defend the dollar through expanded swap
lines and the issuance of yen-denominated treasury securities. At
other times, the dollar was supported by speculation that the Federal
Reserve might increase its discount rate, instructions from Prime
Minister Nakasone to the Bank of Japan to begin lowering short-term
interest rates, reports subsequently confirmed by Chairman Volcker that
the Federal Reserve was tightening, and reports of efforts to effect
coordinated changes in U.S. and Japanese discount rates. Despite these
intermittent gains, however, during the period as a whole, the multi-
lateral, trade-weighted value of the dollar declined about one percent
against the currencies of the foreign G-10 countries. The underlying
selling pressure on the dollar was fueled by the perception that
existing payments imbalances are not sustainable and that the United
States, Japan, and West Germany are not prepared to make adjustments in
policies, either separately or in concert, that can prevent further
dollar depreciation. Market participants were unimpressed with the
outcome of the meeting of G-7 finance ministers and central bankers on
April 8 and disappointed as expectations of discount-rate changes were

not realized. The dollar received further downward impetus from the
release of U.S. trade data for February that were worse than expected.
New U.S. GNP data lowered market assessments of second-quarter growth
in the United States and seemed to limit the scope for tightening by
the Fed. Offsetting some of these negative factors, however, was the
release of favorable U.S. employment data for April.
Against individual currencies, the dollar fell nearly 4
percent against the yen, more than 3-1/2 percent against sterling, and
about a half percent against the mark since the March FOMC meeting. As
the yen strengthened against the dollar, the rate on three-month
gensaki (repo) transactions fell about 20 basis points from its level
at the end of March (see table on three-month interest rates), while
the yield on the ten-year benchmark bond fell nearly 150 basis points.
In the United Kingdom, interest rates on three-month interbank sterling
declined nearly 115 basis points, as the Bank of England twice cut its
money-market dealing rates one half percentage point and major U.K.
banks made equal cuts in their base lending rates. U.K. base lending
rates now stand at 9 percent. Three-month interbank rates in Germany
have eased 25 basis points since the end of March, partly in
anticipation of a decline in the rate at which the Bundesbank performs
its security repurchase transactions. The Bundesbank lowered its repo
rate 25 basis points to 3.55 percent near the end of the intermeeting
period and also lowered its intervention (treasury-bill selling) rate
30 basis points to 3.2 percent.
Sterling was boosted by

IV-4
favorable budget announcements, firming oil prices, and public-opinion
polls indicating a growing likelihood of reelection for the incumbent
party in the national elections scheduled for June 11.
The Desk also intervened in this period, buying $1.5 billion
against yen and $240 million against deutsche marks. Prior to this
period, the last time the Desk sold marks was in May 1984.
The dollar price of gold shot up 12.8 percent to $474.75 in
April but fell back later to $459.50, a net increase of 9.1 percent
from the March FOMC meeting. The price of silver also climbed sharply,
reaching a peak of $11.25 before settling at around $8.50, a net gain
of about 35 percent from the beginning of the intermeeting period.

IV-5
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserves in the United States rose $11 billion in
March to bring the official inflow for the first quarter of 1987 to
$14.5 billion. (See line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table.)
Partial
information for April indicates that official holdings by G-10
countries at FRBNY increased about $5 billion in April,
The increased foreign official holdings of dollars outside the
United States may well be reflected in U.S. data as larger bank-
reported inflows from the Euromarkets. The inflow reported by banks in
the first quarter was large, more than $11 billion. (See line 1 of the
Summary Table.) Most of the inflow was in the form of net borrowing
from own foreign offices. (See line 1 of the table of International
Banking Data.) Balance sheet data indicate that the inflow was used by

U.S. banking offices to offset a weakness in core deposits rather than
to increase lending. In April there was a temporary reversal of the
inflow, which may have been associated with tax-related increases in
domestic deposits at midmonth.
U.S. nonbank residents added to their Eurodollar holdings in
March, bringing the rise for the quarter to $13 billion. (See line 3 of
the International Banking table.) Partial data indicate a $3 billion
decrease in this position in April.
Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stocks and bonds remained
strong in the first quarter and produced a $19 billion inflow. (See
lines 2.a and 2.b of the summary table.) New issues of Eurobonds
accounted for a large part of foreign purchases of U.S. corporate
bonds. U.S. corporations borrowed more than $4 billion in the Eurobond
market in March, raising the total-for the first quarter to $7.7
billion. The Eurobond markets accounted for about 12 percent of new
bond issues by U.S. corporations in the first quarter, slightly less
than the average for 1986. (New Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations
declined sharply in April.) Nearly one-third of the borrowing in the
first quarter was denominated in foreign currencies, with Japanese yen
and Swiss francs accounting for about half of the foreign-currency-
denominated volume.
The trend toward larger foreign net purchases of U.S. stocks
relative to bonds continued last quarter and raised the total purchases
of corporate stocks above that of corporate bonds for the first time in
three years. Two possible explanations for the relatively high foreign
demand for U.S. stocks have been cited. First, price multiples on U.S.
stocks are still low relative to those in many other countries.

IV-9
Second, the uncertain outlook for the dollar makes stocks attractive
relative to bonds in the United States, since a further decline in the
dollar could raise interest rates (either through higher inflation or
policies aimed at supporting the dollar) thereby producing a capital
loss on bonds. At the same time, the impact of higher interest rates
on stock prices would be at least partially offset by enhanced
competitiveness of U.S. firms resulting from a lower dollar.
Private foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries brought a capital
inflow of $5.5 billion for the first quarter, but this is more than
accounted for by net purchases by the IBRD. Excluding the IBRD,
foreigners on balance sold over $1.5 billion in Treasuries. Market
commentary indicates that the foreign demand for Treasuries was strong
at the May refinancing, but it is uncertain how much of this was
ultimately for sale to foreign investors. U.S. residents increased
their net holdings of foreign securities in February and March,
producing a net outflow of $1.7 billion for the first quarter of the
year.
The decision by British Petroleum to buy out the $7 billion
minority interests of its U.S. affiliate, Standard Oil of Ohio, may
swell the U.S. direct investment inflows in 1987. The full amount of
the purchase will not appear immediately as a direct investment inflow
because of financing arranged in the United States by British Petroleum
of North America, but the impact on recorded direct investment inflows
is expected to be substantial nonetheless.

For 1987, only very preliminary information is available for
the months of January and February. Figures for March will be released
May 14, on a similarly preliminary basis, and they will be described in
the Greenbook Supplement.1 These figures are not seasonally adjusted
and include insurance and freight charges in the value of imports.

larger than that recorded in January. However, a review of the
recorded deficits for the past five months suggests that monthly data
continue to be volatile. (See the chart on the next page.) In fact,
1. Beginning with the release of February data, monthly trade figures
are being released 40-45 days following the close of the month, about
two weeks later than in the past. By extending the time taken for
tabulation, the Commerce Department hopes to reduce much of the problem
of the "carry-over" of late import documents. While there was still a
serious problem in the February data, the Commerce Department
anticipates the "carry-over" of late documents to be much reduced
beginning with March data.

the figures for February still contained a serious problem of late
documents which caused the value of imports to be exaggerated in
2February and understated in January.
Averaging the monthly figures, the deficit in January/February
combined was slightly less than in the fourth quarter of 1986. The
average value of both exports and imports was lower than that recorded
in the fourth quarter.
The decline in the value of exports in January/February from
fourth-quarter levels was spread among several trade categories,
particularly agricultural commodities, machinery, aircraft, chemicals
and gold. The decrease in the value of imports appears to have been
widespread across all major non-oil trade categories.
The value of oil imports in January/February combined was
about the same as recorded for the fourth quarter of 1986. A decline
in volume in the January/February period by nearly 10 percent was
offset by a sharp rise in the price of oil imports of about $2.65 per
barrel. The lower volume imported in the first quarter reflects in
part a drawdown in U.S. stocks of petroleum from unusually strong
fourth-quarter levels; U.S. domestic consumption was essentially
unchanged. In February, spot prices in world markets eased somewhat as
demand for OPEC oil appeared markedly lower than the OPEC production
quota, but prices picked up in early-March as OPEC producers
maintained production restraints. From early-March until early-May,
2. Late documents included in February data but belonging largely in
January data amounted to $3.5 billion ($42 billion at an annual rate),
10 percent of the reported February import total. To put this in
perspective, the swing in the published trade deficit from January to
February that was highlighted in press reports last month was $2.8
billion.

IV-13
prices of oil in world spot markets changed only marginally, reflecting
OPEC's willingness to alter production in order to maintain stable
prices.
Data for the full first quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis
will be released by the Commerce Department at the end of May. The
seasonally adjusted data will compare with the figures in the table
below.

Data for net exports of goods and services included in the GNP
figures for 1987-Q1 published last month are very preliminary
estimates. They show an improvement in real net exports of $13.8
billion (1982 dollars) from the fourth quarter level. Since those
figures were estimated, data have become available for import and
export prices (BLS data for 1987-Q1, and unit value index data for
January and February from the Census Bureau). Before the next GNP

IV-14
press release, revised value figures for merchandise exports and
imports will also be available for the full first quarter. The staff
expects that when the data for real net exports are revised, there will
be a somewhat smaller improvement from the fourth quarter level than
originally estimated.
Prices of Non-oil Imports
Recent data on prices of non-oil imports indicate an upturn in
the price of many manufactured goods, particularly capital goods (other
than computers) and consumer goods. (See the table below.) During the
first quarter of 1987, several product categories which had posted
relatively modest changes in the previous quarter registered
significant increases. There were large price increases in the major
non-electric machinery categories, in the price of auto parts from non-
Canadian sources, and in the prices of such consumer goods items as
clothing, photo supplies and scientific equipment. This acceleration
in import prices suggests that, in aggregate terms, the price
competitiveness of domestically produced products has improved
somewhat. On the other hand, prices of imported industrial supplies
(measured here by unit value indexes for January and February) showed
little change from recent weak levels. Also, changes in the prices of
imported foods continued to be dominated by swings in the world coffee
market (whereas coffee shortages were anticipated during the fourth
quarter, Brazil and other producers now have more coffee supplies than
the market anticipated or is interested in buying).

Developments in the Foreign Industrial Countries
The pace of economic activity in most of the major foreign
industrial nations continued to be sluggish in the first quarter of
1987. Using the latest available data, the average three-month index
of industrial production was below year-ago levels in Germany and was
little changed in Japan, Canada, and France. In contrast, industrial
production has risen fairly strongly in Italy and the United Kingdom
since last year. Inflation remained low abroad. However, deflation
slowed in Japan and Germany, partially as a result of higher oil
prices, and inflation rose slightly in France. Trade and current
account surpluses have continued to be very large in Japan and Germany,
although export and import volumes have adjusted somewhat to the
strengthening of the Japanese yen and the German mark over the past two
years. The United Kingdom and Canada have experienced upturns in their
external balances while France and Italy have recently recorded trade
balance deteriorations.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, indicators of real economic
activity have been mixed in recent months. Industrial production rose
by 1.4 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter following declines of about
0.5 percent in both the third and fourth quarters of 1986. Retail
sales rose 4.5 percent (s.a.) in January but fell 1.5 percent in
February. New housing starts have followed a similar path, rising 3.1
percent in January but declining 1.7 percent in February. The
unemployment rate was 2.9 percent in March, down from the record rate
of 3.0 percent in January. Prices have risen little this year. The
Tokyo consumer price index was 0.5 percent below its year-earlier level
in the first quarter of 1987 but in April increased to a level 0.3
percent above April 1986. The all-commodities index of wholesale

prices declined in March to 6.8 percent below its level of a year ago,
while import prices dropped 16.2 percent over the same period. The
decline in wholesale prices has ceased in recent months owing to higher
costs of oil.
Japan's trade surplus (s.a.) declined in February and March but
rose slightly in April. For the first four months of 1987, the
cumulative value of the trade balance was $92.2 billion (s.a.a.r.)
compared with $82.5 billion for all of last year. Export volume
(n.s.a.) continued to decline to a first-quarter level that was 0.2
percent below a year ago while import volume (n.s.a.) rose 8.0 percent
in the first quarter relative to its year-earlier level.
In the face of strong opposition to the sales tax portion of the
tax reform package, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has agreed to
allow a parliamentary committee to debate the issue and decide whether
to adopt, modify, or abandon the sales tax. Without this tax, the
overall tax reform package would be stimulative. The LDP has also
proposed a demand stimulus package with a record supplementary budget
of at least 5 trillion yen ($36 billion) and has announced that at
least 80 percent of already scheduled public works expenditure will be
contracted in the first half of FY 1987 that started April 1. Growth
of M2+CDs remained rapid. In March, this aggregate rose 9.3 percent
(s.a.a.r.), bringing the first quarter increase to 8.8 percent above
the level of the first quarter of 1986.
German economic activity remained weak in the first quarter of
1987. Industrial production fell by 3.2 percent (s.a.) in March,
reversing February's increase and dropping to a level more than 2
percent below March 1986. Retail sales volume rose 1 percent (n.s.a.)
from March 1986 to March 1987, a decrease from the 3 percent annual

IV-21
growth rate for the year ending in February. The average volume of new
orders in February and March rose 1 percent from the previous two-month
period, with domestic orders up 1.5 percent and foreign demand falling
by 1 percent. The unemployment rate increased slightly to 8.9 percent
(s.a.) in March and remained there in April. In April, consumer prices
reached a level 0.1 percent above April 1986, representing the first
time the 12-month inflation rate has been positive since March 1986.
Wholesale prices were up slightly (n.s.a.) in April, reaching a level
5.6 percent below April 1986.
The metal workers union recently agreed to terms for a three-year
contract, averting a major strike. The package reduces the work week
to 37 hours by 1989 and includes average annual wage gains of around
4.1 percent. The increase in wages for 1987 will be 3.7 percent
applied retroactively to April 1.
The trade balance (n.s.a.) for the first quarter of 1987 was $15.1
billion compared with $9.5 billion in the same period of 1986. The
first-quarter current account (n.s.a.) increased by 58 percent between
1986 and 1987. However, evidence on trade volumes indicates that some
adjustment is taking place in response to the strengthening of the
mark. In January, export volume (s.a.) decreased by 4.9 percent to a
level 6.8 percent below January 1986, but import volume (s.a.) also
fell by 2.3 percent to a level only 0.6 percent above a year ago.
The German money supply continued to increase at a rapid pace;
through March, central bank money grew by 7.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) from
the fourth quarter of 1986, above the 3 to 6 percent target range for
1987. On May 12 the rate on repurchase agreements the Bundesbank
enters into declined from 3.8 to 3.55 percent.

IV-22
Indicators of real economic activity were mixed in France, Canada,
and Italy in the last quarter of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987.
On average, industrial production rose during the first two months of
the year in all of these countries after having declined or stagnated
in the last half of 1986. Recent revisions of Italian GDP data provide
further evidence of stagnation in the second half of 1986; real GDP
remained flat in the third and fourth quarters. French real GDP grew
by 2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in both the third and fourth quarters of 1986
and averaged 2.3 percent for the year. Growth was spurred by domestic
demand, especially business fixed capital formation, while the trade
balance contributed negatively. In March, the unemployment rate hit a
new record high of 11.1 percent (s.a.) in France while it fell to 9.3
percent (s.a.) in Canada in April. In contrast, recent data suggest
strong real activity in the United Kingdom. Industrial production
(s.a.) was 2.4 percent above its year-earlier level in both February
and March, and unemployment declined for the eighth consecutive month
to 11 percent (s.a.).
External balances improved in Canada and the United Kingdom, while
France suffered a significant deterioration. The Canadian trade
surplus was $8.8 billion (s.a.a.r.) through March compared with $7.3
billion for 1986. Although the United Kingdom's trade deficit widened
in March, the average deficit for the first quarter was significantly
below that of the last two quarters of 1986. In contrast, the French
cumulative trade balance deficit was $4 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter of 1987 compared with a small surplus for 1986. Most of this
deterioration was due to a considerable worsening of the industrial
trade balance stemming from increased competition from abroad.

IV-23
In financial markets, major banks in Canada raised their prime-
lending rates 50 basis points to 9-1/4 percent on April 23rd as the
Canadian dollar declined below 75 cents.
An interim Italian government led by Christian Democrat Amintore
Fanfani lasted 10 days and then fell; early Parliamentary elections
will be held in mid-June. In the United Kingdom, the government has
called a general election for June 11.

IV-24
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Brazil's new Finance Minister Bresser Pereira devalued the
cruzado by 7-1/2 percent effective May 1 and announced a reduced growth
target for 1987 and other goals conducive to a reconciliation with its
foreign bank creditors, and perhaps with the IMF. In late April,
Mexico drew the first tranche of its $7.7 billion new commercial bank
money package and repaid the banks the $500 million bridge loan that
was arranged last December. Argentina and the Philippines recently
completed agreements with commercial banks to reschedule approximately
$30 billion and $13 billion of foreign debt, respectively. Argentina
will also receive $1.95 billion in new money. However, the Philippine
government has indicated it may reopen loan negotiations to obtain the
lower interest rate, 13/16 percent over LIBOR, that Argentina received
in April and Mexico received last year. Chile reached agreement with
the Paris Club in early April to reschedule 85 percent of bilateral
credits maturing in 1987 and 1988. In mid-April, the Venezuelan
government announced regulations implementing a debt-equity conversion
program that allows conversions in a wide range of sectors.
Individual Country Notes. Brazil's Finance Minister Funaro
resigned in late April reflecting growing domestic dissatisfaction over
the relapse to high inflation (14.4 percent in March and an estimated
19.5 percent in April), declining real wages, and--of notable concern
to the business community--continuing weakness of exports (with a
first-quarter trade surplus of only $0.6 billion, compared with $2.7
billion a year earlier). Newly appointed Finance Minister Bresser
Pereira announced a 7-1/2 percent devaluation of the exchange rate and
articulated several reassuring economic policy goals--a cooling of GDP

IV-25
growth to 3 or 3-1/2 percent in 1987, maintenance of positive real
interest rates, restoration of a $9 billion average trade surplus in
the medium term, and correction of public sector prices and other
measures to reduce the fiscal deficit. While Bresser's appointment
should be viewed as a positive development, it remains to be seen how
successful he will be in implementing the policies he is recommending.
President Sarney has been hesitant to take unpopular economic measures
because the Brazilian Congress could shorten his presidential term.
When negotiations with commercial banks begin, Bresser will seek new
money--with a total of $4 billion per year from official and private
sources still being cited as Brazil's requirement over the next several
years. Bresser's economic team (which includes a new Central Bank
President Fernando Milliet) is now preparing an economic plan--expected
to deal with wages, prices, fiscal policy, and negotiation of the
external debt--for presentation to President Sarrey by early June. An
IMF mission arrived in Brazil in late April (the first IMF visit since
collapse of the Cruzado Plan last fall) to survey economic conditions
and to prepare a report for the Paris Club creditors.
Mexico drew the first tranche of $3.5 billion under the
commercial bank $7.7 billion new money financing on April 30, after
commitments exceeded 100 percent, and used $500 million to repay the
bridge loan from 54 banks that had been outstanding since last
December. The next $500 million tranche is contingent upon Mexico
having made the third drawing under its IMF stand-by arrangement. This
drawing is expected in late May after the IMF Board approves a program
review and specific quantitative performance criteria for 1987.

IV-26
Interest rates, which began to decline in March after five months
of near stability, continued downward in April, but Treasury bills and
most time deposits still have positive real interest rates despite some
upsurge in inflation. Consumer prices rose by 6.6 percent in March and
by 8.7 percent in April, when they were 121 percent higher than a year
earlier. The peso price of the dollar rose by only 5.6 percent in
April. Since the end of November 1986, the peso has appreciated in
real terms against the dollar by 3.4 percent. However, exports
continued to rise in March, bringing first-quarter exports to $5.2
billion, 23 percent higher than a year earlier. First-quarter imports
were 12 percent lower than a year earlier.
In April, Argentina and its bank advisory committee agreed on a
$30 billion debt rescheduling and $1.95 billion in new money.
Rescheduled debt will have a tenor of 19 years with 7 years of grace
and interest at 13/16 percentage points above LIBOR. The new money
package consists of a $1.55 billion term loan that has a tenor of 12
years with 5 years of grace at an interest rate of 7/8 percentage
points above LIBOR and a trade credit and deposit facility of $400
million carrying a spread of 13/16 percentage points over LIBOR.
The Argentine agreement with the commercial banks includes some
innovative measures aimed at providing a menu of options for banks
participating in new financing and at speeding the process of attaining
a "critical mass" of new money commitments to the bank package. These
measures include: (1) an "alternative participation instrument" or
"exit bond" that will enable banks to exchange up to $5 million of
their outstanding loans for a 25-year bearer bond (including 12 years
of grace) that pays a fixed 4 percent annual interest rate (amounts

subscribed to this bond will be excluded from the base debt from which
new money contributions by individual banks are calculated); (2) a "new
money instrument" that will be a bearer bond with a maximum
subscription of $1 million per bank and will have the same terms as
other new money under the 1987 term loan; and (3) an early
participation fee of a flat 3/8 percent of the new money contribution
for lenders that commit their share of new financing on or before June
17, 1987, and a fee of 1/8 percent for lenders that commit to the new
money agreement on or before July 17, 1987. Argentina will seek to
reschedule debt maturing in 1986-88 owed to official creditors in talks
with the Paris Club in late May.
After rising at a 7.5 percent average monthly rate during the
first quarter of 1987, consumer prices in Argentina rose about 3.4
percent in April.
On March 27, the Philippine government reached agreement with its
bank creditors to reschedule $13.2 billion in outstanding debt,
including $3 billion in trade credits. Repayment is to be made over 17
years, with 7-1/2 years of grace. The spread over LIBOR will be 7/8
percentage points, except for the trade credits with a spread of 3/4
percentage points, and will increase to 1 percentage point if the
Philippine government fails to maintain the amortization schedule from
1990 on, or to make certain prepayments during 1987-89. The agreement
gives the creditor banks the option of receiving a portion of the
interest payments in Philippine Investment Notes (PINs), which are
freely transferable, foreign-currency-denominated, non-interest-
bearing, six-year notes that can be used to make approved equity
investments in the Philippines. In mid-April, the Philippine

IV-28
authorities stated their intention to request a reopening of loan
negotiations so that the Philippines could obtain the slightly lower
spread granted to Argentina in April. To date, however, there has been
no formal request from the Philippine authorities for a resumption of
negotiations. On April 20, the IMF completed a favorable First Review
of the Philippines' October 1986 IMF stand-by arrangement.
In early April, Chile reached agreement with the Paris Club to
reschedule 85 percent of amortization of official debt due in 1987 and
1988, yielding a reduction of $140 million in debt service payments
during 1987-88. With the restructuring of its bank debt (at 1 to 1-1/8
percent over LIBOR) in February, this completes the 1987-88 financing
package for Chile.
In mid-April, the Venezuelan government announced regulations
implementing a debt-equity conversion program. The program allows
conversions in a wide range of sectors and establishes a commission
with substantial discretionary power over the terms and conditions of
the conversion.
Wage and price pressures are growing in Venezuela following the
December devaluation of the main controlled exchange rate from 7.5 to
14.5 bolivars per dollar. (On May 12, the free market exchange rate
was 26.80 compared to 24.23 on April 27.) On April 27, the government
announced a general wage increase of 20-30 percent, with most workers
receiving 25 percent increases. At the same time, the government froze
prices on 70 basic commodities and prohibited layoffs for four months.
The measures appear to be a response to rising inflation and labor
unrest. Inflation, which was 12 percent in 1986, rose at a 28 percent
annual rate during the first quarter of 1987.
