The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity continues to advance at a moderate rate, with
a stronger export performance apparently countering the sluggishness in
consumer demand. Employment gains have remained healthy this year, and
manufacturing output resumed an upward course in May. Increases in
both consumer and producer prices were moderate in May, after sizable
increases earlier in the year that were related in large part to a
rebound in crude oil prices.
Employment and Unemployment
Recent labor market data indicate a continuation of strong hiring
trends, and the unemployment rate-which dropped sharply in April-held
steady at 6.3 percent in May. Gains in nonfarm payroll employment so
far this year have run considerably above the average 1986 pace. As has
been the case during much of the current expansion, services have
accounted for most of the rise in employment so far this year. However,
manufacturing employment also has picked up, with small but fairly
steady gains since the fourth quarter of last year. Among specific
industries, employment has increased this year in printing, rubber,
textiles, lumber, and furniture, while declining in transportation
equipment and electrical machinery. Construction employment, which
posted healthy advances earlier this year, has since fallen, reflecting
weakness in the housing sector.

Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial producton has risen at a moderate pace so far in
1987. The advance reflects, in part, a firming in output of business
equipment, which lagged in 1985 and 1986. In particular, computer
production rose at an annual rate of nearly 14 percent during the first
five months of this year; output of some other high-tech capital goods,
such as medical instruments and scientific and optical goods, also has
registered strong gains in recent months. At the same time, output of
construction supplies and home goods has leveled off since the turn of
the year after strong gains in the second half of 1986.
Auto assemblies, which fell sharply during March and April, edged
still lower in May to an annual rate of 7.1 million units. Despite the
reduced rate of production, dealers' stocks rose further in May.
Assemblies apparently totaled nearly 7 million units at an annual rate
in June, about the same as the pace of sales during the first 20
days of the month, and they are scheduled to remain low through the
third quarter. Barring an autonomous surge in sales, producers likely
will introduce a new round of sales incentives later this summer-but
at this point, the bigger firms appear to be willing to run with high
stocks pending a clarification of strike prospects.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities
increased 0.2 percentage point in May to 79.6 percent. Overall,
utilization in industry has shown little net change since December.
The utilization rate in manufacturing rose 0.3 percentage point in May
to 80.2 percent, close to the average rate over the past 20 years.
Compared with historical averages, operating rates are relatively low

for durable manufacturing, particularly in the machinery industries.
By contrast, utilization in nondurable manufacturing has been above its
historical average, especially in textiles and paper.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal income growth so far this year has been stronger than in
1986, but with consumer prices accelerating, growth in real income, on
average, has been relatively slow. Growth in nominal personal income
in April and May, at an average monthly rate of about $10-1/2 billion,
was about the same as the 1986 average, but well below the strong
first-quarter pace. The deceleration in income relative to the first
quarter mainly reflects smaller gains in wages and salaries and the
absence of sizable subsidy payments to farmers. Interest income has
continued to grow at a rapid pace.
Disposable income has been extraordinarily volatile in recent months,
owing mainly to an enormous increase in tax payments in April associated
with one-time effects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In May, when tax
payments returned to a more normal level, disposable income in real
terms probably advanced to a level slightly above the first-quarter
average. The personal saving rate, which fell almost to zero in April,
returned to 3.3 percent in May, about the same as in the first quarter.
At the same time, rising household wealth still appears to be
providing support for consumption. Since the last Greenbook, gains in
the stock market have added about $200 billion to the net worth of
households, for a total of $800 billion since the end of 1986.
Growth in real consumer spending, which outpaced income gains
through much of 1986, has lagged thus far this year. Total auto sales

dropped back in May to 9.7 million units at an annual rate-the same
sluggish pace as in the first quarter, when sales had been depressed by
year-end tax law changes. By contrast, sales of light trucks, most of
which are purchased by consumers, were down a bit in May, but the level
of sales was up 4-1/2 percent from the first-quarter average. Meanwhile,
spending on other goods has been lackluster. In constant dollars,
outlays for durables other than autos have been flat, on balance, since
the.fourth quarter of last year, while spending for nondurables in
recent months was no higher than in mid-1986. In the service sector,
real consumer outlays posted a strong gain in the first quarter, but
apparently have moderated recently to a pace similar to that in 1986.
Business Fixed Investment
Spending for business fixed investment, in real terms, appears to
have rebounded moderately in the second quarter, after a tax-induced
annual rate of decline of nearly 10 percent in the first quarter. On
the equipment side, nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods were
flat in April and fell in May; however, because of earlier advances,
the average level of shipments during these two months was almost 2
percent above the first-quarter average. In addition, the value of
nonresidential construction put in place (which excludes petroleum
drilling) leveled off in April and advanced 2 percent in May after
having fallen sharply in the first quarter.
Advance indicators of future investment spending recently have
shown some signs of improvement. Excluding the aircraft group, the
average level of new orders for nondefense capital goods in April and
May was 3.7 percent above the first-quarter average. For nonresidential

construction, new commitments have trended up slightly since mid-1986,
with the rise concentrated in the institutional category. Nevertheless,
high vacancy rates continue to damp construction of office buildings.
Recent surveys of plant and equipment spending by the Commerce
Department, McGraw-Hill, and Merrill Lynch report that firms expect
nominal outlays in 1987 to be about 3 percent higher than in 1986,
slightly more than was indicated by the previous set of surveys. The
current spending plans represent a significant turnaround from the 2
percent drop in the outlays estimated to have occurred in 1986. About
half of this improvement stems from a leveling off of investment outlays
by petroleum and mining firms, which had plunged last year. The surveys
indicate a pickup in outlays by manufacturing companies, with firms
favoring modernization over expansion by a ratio of more than two to
one. As recently as 1980, the ratio was about fifty-fifty.
Nevertheless, given the weakness of actual expenditures so far
this year, the pace of spending would have to accelerate sharply to
achieve the increase in outlays indicated by the surveys. Indeed, a
3 percent increase in 1987 outlays implies, in terms of a straight-line
path, nominal spending growth at more than a 13 percent annual rate for
the rest of the year. All three surveys have tended to overestimate
spending gains in recent years, with the average bias ranging from 0.8
to 1.6 percentage points.

II-13
Inventories
The inventory data for the second quarter, while still quite
limited, indicate a more moderate rate of accumulation than in the first
quarter. In the auto sector, the data on unit stocks through May show
a sharp slowing after the first-quarter bulge, although inventories
remained at high levels. Excluding autos, manufacturing and trade
stocks rose moderately in April, at an annual rate of about $8.8 billion
in real terms, and inventories apparently are in line with sales in most
sectors.
Manufacturers' inventory stance has remained conservative this
year. Factory stock accumulation over the first four months of this
year, in constant dollars, averaged only $2 billion at an annual rate.
In May, manufacturers' stocks; in current dollars rose $9 billion at an
annual rate, and the inventory-sales ratio remained unchanged from April.
In the trade sector, nonauto inventories, in real terms, expanded in
April-at about the same moderate pace as during the first quarter;
overall, the inventory position of wholesalers and nonauto retailers
has been little changed since January.
Housing Markets
Housing activity has slumped in response to the backup in mortgage
rates during the spring. Housing starts fell in May for a third month,
as single-family construction dropped about 8 percent, to 1.13 million
units at an annual rate. Moreover, sales of new single-family homes
fell about 15 percent in May from a downward-revised April level. New
home sales appear to have been damped by the rise in conventional
mortgage interest rates, which jumped 1-1/2 percentage points from March

to May. Sales of existing houses rebounded in May, and were little
different from the average pace during the preceding six months.
Despite an uptick in May, multifamily starts were down 10 percent
from the first-quarter average. Multifamily construction has trended
down since early 1986, reflecting near-record rental vacancy rates and
last year's tax law changes.
Housing activity has been characterized by wide regional disparities,
particularly between the South and the Northeast. Housing demand
remains relatively weak in the South, largely reflecting depressed
conditions in the energy sector. In that region total housing starts
have declined for more than a year, and housing prices have risen
considerably less than the national average. By contrast, in the
Northeast housing starts rose about 9 percent in the first quarter;
price increases for both new and existing houses have been much larger
than in other regions; and rental vacancy rates, although up slightly
in the first quarter, remain well below the national average.
Federal Government
Last week Congress passed a budget resolution that provides a
blueprint for subsequent FY1988 appropriations and other spending and
revenue legislation. The resolution specifies no growth in real military
spending authority, further reductions in domestic spending, and a $19
billion tax increase. The nature of the tax rise was not specified,
but the level of defense appropriations is contingent upon enactment of
the revenue measure. The resolution states that if the President fails
to sign the necessary tax legislation, the appropriation for defense

II-17
will be cut $7 billion. Another $7 billion deficit reduction is assumed
to result from early repayment of loans made by the Rural Electrification
Administration. By forgiving current prepayment penalties, it is
anticipated that these loans will be repaid in FY1988, with borrowers
likely refinancing in the private market.
Under CBO's economic and technical assumptions, the congressional
resolution falls about $26 billion short of meeting the Gramm-Rudman-
Hollings deficit target of $108 billion. However, the resolution meets
the deficit target under the assumptions made by OMB in February.
Nevertheless, neither the CBO nor the OMB assumptions reflect more
recent data, and reports suggest that revisions incorporating this
information would push the FY1988 deficit estimates up roughly $10
billion.
In contrast, estimates of the budget deficit for the current
fiscal year have remained at about $170 billion. Preliminary data for
June give additional evidence that the increase in corporate tax payments
resulting from tax reform is less than had been anticipated. The increase
may have been muted by the safe-harbor rules that have permitted
corporations some leeway in April and June in meeting payments due
under the new tax law.1 Meanwhile, after surprisingly large bulges
in January and April, receipts for individual nonwithheld taxes appear
to have conformed to a more typical pattern in June. The June figures
1. Apparently, many corporations have been unable to accurately calculate
their tax liabilities because the IRS has not yet issued explanations
of the relevant provisions in the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The safe-harbor
ruling allows corporations to assume that this year's annualized taxable
income will equal 120 percent of their taxable income in the preceding
year. However, tax payments after July 1 will need to be large enough
to make up for temporary shortfalls that arise from the safe-harbor
provisions.

II-18
for individual tax revenues suggest that the runups experienced earlier
in the year reflected mostly increases in receipts from capital gains,
probably induced by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Recent information also indicates that outlays are continuing
to grow moderately. Through the first eight months of the current
fiscal year, outlays were up only 2 percent compared with the same
period a year earlier. The rise in defense spending has slowed to
3-1/4 percent, compared with the average rate of 9 percent during the
previous three years. Also, the effects of spending cuts on many
discretionary domestic programs and the leveling off of interest payments
appear to have offset much of the rise in outlays for social insurance
programs.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
probably rose further, on balance, early in the second quarter. Employment
jumped 55,000 in April, the largest rise in six months, and edged up
further in May. However, real outlays for construction in April and May,
on average, were slightly below the first-quarter level.
The financial situation remained uncertain in many states as the
fiscal year ended on June 30 for all but four states. Several states
have been reporting greater-than-expected tax collections, particularly
in April, evidently reflecting the large volume of capital gains realized
at the end of 1986. In California, for example, the Commission on
State Finances estimated in June that the state received $1.4 billion
more in revenue than was estimated just three months earlier; other
states that underestimated receipts include New York, Connecticut,

II-19
Vermont, Iowa, and Maine. In contrast, many other states, particularly
in the oil patch, continue to experience budgetary pressures. On balance,
a small surplus of operating and capital accounts is expected for the
sector as a whole in the fiscal year just ended.
Prices
Inflation rates moderated in May, in large part owing to a
deceleration in energy and apparel prices. Even so, the May increases-
0.3 percent for both the CPI and the PPI for finished goods-continue to
reflect some acceleration from the 1986 pace.
Increases in retail energy prices, which boosted the first-quarter
CPI, slowed in April and May. Although the runup in crude oil prices
this winter already has been reflected in retail prices, crude oil
costs have risen about a dollar further over the past two months. This
suggests some additional increase in consumer energy prices during the
next month or two. OPEC agreed in late June to limit its output to a
total of 16.6 barrels per day for the rest of the year, close to recent
levels of production. Even allowing for some output in excess of the
announced quota, it appears that OPEC's decision probably will help to
keep prices firm.
Consumer food prices rose 0.5 percent in May, mainly reflecting
large increases for meats and fresh vegetables. At the farm level,
livestock prices rose rapidly through May, but price changes in spot
markets since the May PPI indicate a leveling off for these commodities.
Moreover, meat production is expected to increase later this year, and
futures prices for hogs and, to a lesser extent, for cattle continue to
indicate lower prices by the fall. The May CPI for fruits and vegetables

was up sharply for a second month, with sizable increases for a variety
of items. However, the prices received by growers fell sharply in
April and May, providing some hope for an easing of price increases at
the retail level during the summer.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose 0.3 percent in May,
following gains of 0.5 percent in each of the two preceding months. A
slowdown in apparel prices, which rose very rapidly earlier in the year,
more than accounted for the moderation. So far this year, the prices
of consumer commodities other than food and energy have risen, on
average, about 0.4 percent per month, compared with an average monthly
pace of about 0.1 percent last year. This acceleration, which has been
evident for several commodity groups, reflects, in part, an increase in
import prices, and also a swing in used car prices. Nonenergy service
prices have risen at an average monthly rate of 0.4 percent so far this
year, similar to that in 1986.
To date, there is only limited evidence of domestic producers
marking up their prices as import prices go up. The PPI for finished
goods less food and energy was little changed, on balance, from March
to May, and has risen at an annual rate of 2 percent since December,
less than the 1986 pace. However, at earlier stages of processing,
domestic price increases have accelerated. The PPI for intermediate
materials (also excluding food and energy) has picked up to about a
3-1/2 percent rate so far this year. This index edged down from mid-
1985 to mid-1986, and rose about 1 percent at an annual rate in the
second half of last year. Petroleum-based materials-such as industrial
chemicals and plastic resins-have been boosted by the passthrough of

II-24
higher crude oil prices. In addition, prices of primary nonferrous
metals have continued to recover on world markets, responding to the
lower exchange value of the dollar as well as to tighter supplies,
worsened in some cases by strikes and other disruptions. In addition,
high levels of capacity utilization have contributed to rapid price
increases for woodpulp, paperboard, and packaging.
The PPI for crude nonfood materials less energy turned up late last
year and has risen about 7 percent (not annual rate) since last December;
this followed declines over most of the preceding two years. A similar
pattern is apparent in the commodity price indexes based mainly on
industrial materials. The recovery in the Journal of Commerce and CRB
spot price indexes for industrial materials, which started in the
latter part of last year, has retraced most of the declines that had
occurred since 1984. These indexes have registered increases since the
PPI pricing date in the second week of May. By contrast, the Dow Jones
spot price index and the CRB futures index were down, on balance,
reflecting declines for feeds and precious metals.
Wages
Available measures of labor costs show moderation in wage inflation.
Wage rates, as measured by the hourly earnings index for production and
nonsupervisory workers, remained flat in May after a small increase in
April. Wage increases in transportation and public utilities were
offset by declines in manufacturing, especially in the nondurable goods
industries. Over the past 12 months, the hourly earnings index for the
private nonfarm economy rose 2-1/4 percent, while that for manufacturing
rose only 1.1 percent. (More comprehensive data on compensation and
labor costs will not be available until late July and early August.)

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The anxieties that drove down securities prices and disrupted
finan ing patterns in the weeks preceding the May 19 FOMC meeting have
eased considerably. Citicorp's announcement of large loan-loss provisions
and word that Chairman Volcker would be stepping down prompted only transi-
tory market setbacks as U.S. financial markets benefited from generally
buoyant demand for the dollar on the exchange markets.
Treasury bond yields have fallen about 1/2 percentage point from
their peak levels at the time of the FOMC meeting, offsetting more than
one-third of the April-May backup; other long-term rates peaked a bit
later but have fallen considerably from their highs (corporate rates by
about 25 basis points and municipals by about 60 basis points). Short-term
yields have dropped 1/8 to 3/8 of a point in most cases, against a backdrop
of an unchanged federal funds rate of 6-3/4 percent.
Monetary data have reflected an unwinding of the buildup in balances
that occurred in connection with April tax payments. M1 is estimated to
have contracted slightly on balance over May and June, and M2 grew only
a little over the two months, moving further below its 1987 target range.
Meanwhile, M3 increased moderately on the strength of bank managed
liabilities and stands near the bottom end of the annual growth cone.
Averaging out some sharp month-to-month fluctuations, net borrowing
by the domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have picked up a bit on a
seasonally adjusted basis during the second quarter. Federal borrowing
increased somewhat despite a small quarterly surplus, as the Treasury
allowed its cash balance to build up; issuance of coupon securities has
been substantial, but a sizable volume of bills has been permitted to run

off. Borrowing by state and local governments was weaker for the quarter,
despite some rebound in bond offerings after the market strengthened in
June. Household debt growth bulged in April as borrowers rushed to close
on about-to-expire mortgage commitments received before rates climbed, and
as consumers relied more heavily on installment credit at a time when large
tax payments were crimping household cash flow; for the quarter as a whole,
net borrowing by households probably significantly exceeded the slow pace
of the first quarter, which reflected year-end tax factors. Net business
borrowing has been moderate; although shorter-term credit sources were
tapped more heavily during the quarter, there was a clear shift back to
bond issuance with the easing in long-term rates over the past month.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Growth in the monetary aggregates generally has weakened again since
the tax-related pickup in April. Between the end of last year and mid-1987,
growth in M1 and M2 receded to about one-half the rates for all of 1986 and
growth in M3 was about two-thirds of last year's pace. As a result, the
velocities of M2 and M3 increased during the first half, and the extended
decline of M1 velocity was virtually halted in the second quarter.
Contributing to the slower expansion of M1 and M2 this year has been
the increasing opportunity cost of holding deposits. Interest rates on
retail deposits, especially those for the most liquid monetary components,
have adjusted rather slowly to the increases in market rates which began
last fall. For example, the spread between the six-month Treasury bill
rate and rates on NOW accounts at banks reached more than 150 basis points
in May, the widest spread since April 1986.
M1 recorded only a small advance in May, and likely contracted in June
at an annual rate of 7 percent or more. Both demand deposits and other

III-4
checkable deposits apparently declined last month, the latter for the first
time since the early 1980s. The weakening in transactions deposits in May
was partly attributable to the clearance of checks sent to the IRS for
April 15 tax payments, but no special factor seems to have contributed
significantly to the contraction in June. (The Greenbook supplement will
present updated estimates for June and the second quarter.)
M2 was essentially unchanged in May and is estimated to have expanded
only a little in June. The nontransactions component fell marginally on a
month-average basis in May, evidently owing to the effects of tax payments
on checkable MMDAs and money market mutual fund shares (neither of which
is seasonally adjusted in the monetary data). In contrast, June growth in
the non-M1 component likely recovered to around a 7 percent annual rate,
helped by the first substantial inflows into small time deposits in more
than a year. The resumption of growth in small time deposits was encouraged
by a steepening of the offering-rate curve for retail deposits. This has
altered the composition of inflows to M2-type deposits, and probably
accounted also for much of the May-June slowdown in savings deposit growth
and the continued weakness in MMDAs (see chart on page III-20).
Substitution of small time deposits for more liquid core deposits was
particularly evident in the Boston and New York Districts, where a well-
publicized "rate war" on small time deposits has been waged. Between the
weeks of May 11 and June 15, small time deposits at all institutions in these
Districts grew at a rate more than three times that in other Districts, and
those at commercial banks-which have been the most prominent combatants-
grew at a rate more than ten times that of banks in other Districts.
However, the growth rate of core deposits at all depository institutions

III-5
in Districts 1 and 2 was only marginally higher than that in Districts 3
through 12, suggesting that much of the strength of small time inflows in
the Northeast is attributable to substitution from other types of accounts.

Although these strong inflows helped bring growth in small time deposits
at banks even with that at thrifts in June, for the year as a whole thrifts
have relied far more heavily on small time deposits than have banks. Since
January, small time deposits at banks have run off by more than $4 billion;
at thrifts they have risen by $3-3/4 billion. This strength of small time
deposits at thrifts may reflect in part the success of these institutions in
encouraging skittish owners of large time deposits to shift funds into smaller
deposits fully covered by the $100,000 insurance limit; so far this year,
depositors at thrifts have withdrawn $4 billion (net) of large time deposits.
M3 growth was held down in May as banks drew on roughly $10 billion
in net borrowings from their foreign offices and increases in Treasury

balances to finance a reduced rate of credit expansion. Despite a runoff of
large time deposits at troubled thrifts, particularly in the Southwest, and
slow growth at banks with sizable holdings of energy-related loans, overall
growth in large time deposits remained brisk in May. Large time deposits
accelerated further in June and, with the somewhat faster expansion estimated
for M2, M3 growth is estimated to have climbed to a 7 percent rate in June.
Growth of bank credit has tapered off after an April spurt, slowing
to a 7-1/2 percent annual pace in May and moderating further in June,
according to preliminary estimates. Slower loan growth in May was partly
offset by substantial net acquisitions of U.S. government securities, but,
according to early estimates, both loans and investments grew at a reduced
pace in June. Among loan categories, real estate lending remained an
island of strength throughout the second quarter. Consumer loans were
about unchanged in May and probably in June as well. Business loan growth
slowed to a 4 percent rate in May and apparently dwindled further in June;
moreover, part of the growth in business loans in May represented a shifting
to U.S. offices of loans usually booked by U.S. banks at their foreign
branches.
Corporate Finance
Bond offerings by nonfinancial corporations picked up when the market
rallied in June. At the same time, short-term borrowing generally weakened:
net issuance of commercial paper by nonfinancial firms evaporated in the
early weeks of June and, as noted above, business loans at commercial banks
manifested little growth. For the second quarter as a whole, however, gross
issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations was the lightest in nearly
two years, and net business borrowing in the aggregate, though probably up

from the volume of the first quarter, remained below the average pace
for the year 1986. Bond issuance by utilities in the second quarter was
especially anemic, suggesting a continued slowing in refunding issues;
in 1986, most of the refundings were by utilities. In the Euro market,
where rate increases on dollar-denominated debt issues were reportedly even
steeper than on domestic issues owing to generally negative views of European
investors toward the dollar, issuance by nonfinancial corporations dropped
in June from the volumes of the first quarter and last year.
Bond offerings by financial firms also picked up in June, paced by
a heavy volume of mortgage-backed securities. Some of the new issues
contained a floating-rate tranche as part of a multiclass collateralized
mortgage obligation (CMO).1 The IRS ruled that, beginning June 15, floating-
rate CMOs could be offered through a real estate mortgage investment conduit
(REMIC), and because REMIC securities qualify as mortgage investments for
thrift institutions while regular CMOs do not, the ruling is expected to
increase the attractiveness of floating-rate tranches to thrifts. Offerings
of securities backed by automobile loans and credit card receivables also
strengthened in June.
In the equity markets, prices have risen substantially since the last
FOMC meeting, with major indexes reaching new highs. Market prices of large
1. In a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), the payment stream of the
underlying mortgage assets is manipulated to create "tranches" of securities
with different payment characteristics and expected maturities. When one
or more of these tranches bears a floating rate, the resulting interest
rate risk is either shifted to one or more of the other tranches or, more
commonly, embedded in the residual value of the CMO to its owner. The
latter arrangement requires that the CMO be overcollateralized sufficiently
to guarantee that even if short-term rates were to rise substantially,
payments on the floating-rate tranche could continue to be met. To put
a limit on the amount of necessary overcollateralization, the floating
rates are almost always capped.

bank stocks have generally outpaced the broad-based indexes as investors
appear to have reacted favorably to increased provisions for loan-loss
reserves. Gross equity offerings of nonfinancial firms have increased this
quarter, but the rise appears to have been more than offset by larger share
retirements from mergers and other corporate restructurings.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The total budget of the federal government is estimated to have been
roughly in balance in the second quarter of 1987, after a $59 billion
deficit in the previous quarter. The unusually pronounced cutback in the
deficit is attributable mainly to very large payments of nonwithheld taxes
by individuals in April that were generated by substantial capital gains
realized in late 1986. Corporate tax payments in April and June were
increased by tax reform, but these gains appear to have been smaller than
widely expected. This shortfall may have occurred because the new law does
not become fully applicable until the September payment; it also could
reflect a smaller net effect of the tax law on corporate liabilities than
previously thought.
The Treasury borrowed almost $30 billion, net, from the public in the
second quarter, substantially increasing its cash balance to a level of
$40 billion at quarter-end. It raised $38 billion of new cash through
marketable coupon issues, while continuing to pay down bills--more than
$17 billion, net. Issuance of nonmarketable debt raised $9 billion in
funds in the quarter; of this amount, about $6-1/2 billion was obtained
from the state and local government series.
Net borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies in the second
quarter is estimated at $7.2 billion after a net paydown of $2 billion in the

III-12
first quarter. The Federal Home Loan Banks accounted for most of the new
funds raised in the second quarter as they accommodated heavy demand for
advances by thrifts. Fannie Mae probably retired a small amount of debt
on net on the heels of a nearly $2 billion paydown in the first quarter;
the agency had shifted some of its anticipated borrowing forward into 1986
in response to favorable year-end market conditions, and borrowing needs
were still comparatively light in the second quarter.
The Farm Credit Banks also continued to pay down debt, in view of
further writeoffs of bad loans, slack demand for new credit, and the with-
drawal of creditworthy borrowers able to find more favorable terms through
other channels. These banks have had to pay an increasing premium on their
securities over the past few months, as quality spreads in general have
widened and as specific concerns about the FCBs may have mounted. Spreads
between rates on 3- and 6-month issues of the FCBs and comparable Treasury
securities were about 90 and 120 basis points at the pricing in June,
compared with spreads of 70 to 75 basis points in April. They had been in
the 25 to 35 basis point range as recently as January.
Municipal Securities Market
Gross offerings of long-term municipal securities snapped back sharply
in June when rates turned downward. With rates still well above their levels
earlier in the year, however, the volume of refunding issues remained light,
and the overall pickup in offerings was almost entirely attributable to
financings to raise new capital.
Although new-capital issues were heavier in the second quarter as a
whole than in the first, the pace of such offerings remained well below
that of recent years. A considerable amount of unspent funds remains from

III-13
those earlier financings, but the comparative sluggishness this year
also reflects tax reform provisions that narrowed the definition of public-
purpose debt and tightened arbitrage restrictions. In addition, private-
purpose offerings have been constrained by lower caps on volume.

Short-term municipal offerings (13 months or less) rose in June,
notwithstanding delay by the State of California of at least $1.0 billion
of revenue anticipation notes pending final determination of the state's
budget. Included in the June note volume was a $785 million offering
from Los Angeles County that, with $100 million of it denominated in New
Zealand dollars, became the first state or local government security denomi-
nated in a foreign currency. Interest on the issue is tax-exempt, while
increases in the principal due to exchange rate fluctuations are taxable.
The county has avoided currency risk by arranging swap agreements into
dollars in June and back into New Zealand dollars next year when the notes

Mortgage Markets
Interest rates quoted on commitments for fixed-rate conventional
home mortgages have declined almost 1/2 percentage point from their peaks
reached shortly after the last FOMC meeting; nonetheless, in late June
they still stood about 1-1/4 percentage points above the nine-year lows
recorded in March. In comparison, interest rates on adjustable-rate
mortgage commitments have been fairly stable in recent months. The average
rate on Treasury-indexed ARMs has declined about 1/8 percentage point since
the FOMC last met. Thus, the spread between fixed and adjustable mortgage
rates is still about a percentage point greater than in March.
Home mortgage borrowing was quite heavy in April, when the jump in
mortgage rates prompted borrowers to press for closings on earlier low-
rate loan commitments. Loan originations at FSLIC-insured thrifts in April
were the fourth highest on record, and their holdings of mortgage assets
increased almost $9 billion, including a record $7.2 billion in mortgage-
backed securities. With the runup in rates, thrift institutions apparently
chose to swap newly originated loans for securities in order to borrow
against the securities rather than sell the below-market-rate loans at a
loss.
Mortgage lending activity probably tapered off later in the quarter,
however, as older, low-rate commitments expired. Mortgage bankers surveyed
weekly by HUD reported a falloff in new applications for conventional and
FHA mortgages between early April and mid-June, although the decline appeared
to moderate with the recent pullback in rates.
Issuance of mortgage pass-through securities guaranteed by GNMA
declined substantially in May, while the volume of FNMA- and FHLMC-related

issues was little changed. After the VA ceiling rate was increased in
mid-April, and again on May 11, lenders who had "locked-in" commitments at
low rates took advantage of a standard clause in FHA/VA mortgage contracts
that releases the lender from a commitment in the event of a change in the
VA mortgage rate ceiling. Faced with rates substantially higher than they
had expected, many borrowers apparently chose not to go ahead with the
financing, thereby reducing the supply of new FHA/VA mortgages available
for conversion into new GNMA pass-throughs. In contrast, because conven-
tional mortgage contracts typically do not include a bailout clause, issuance
of FHLMC and FNMA pass-throughs remained strong.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit, which had grown quite slowly for several
months, picked up in April but apparently expanded little further in May.
Consumer borrowing at commercial banks, retailers, and gasoline companies
(accounting for about half of total outstandings) declined at a 1-1/2
percent annual rate in May, after rising at a 6-1/4 percent pace in April.
Revolving credit was the strongest component in April, perhaps reflecting a
rise in charge activity as other funding sources were drawn on to meet
unusually large tax payments; its growth appears to have been minimal again
in May.
Consumer installment credit advanced at only a 2 percent pace in the
six months through April. Besides the more sluggish behavior of consumer
outlays, this subdued growth in credit reflects significant shifts into
home equity lines of credit. Aggregate data on outstanding home equity
loans are not available, but some information on the prevalence and usage
of equity-secured lines was collected recently in a Board-sponsored survey

of households by the University of Michigan. Of all households covered,
only 4 percent actually had home equity lines of credit, most of which had
been issued by banks or thrift institutions and established in 1986 or
early 1987. The most popular use of these lines has been to pay down
existing debts (mainly credit cards), followed closely by spending for home
improvement. Thirty percent of lineholders had not activated their lines
at all. The average credit line was well below the amount of home equity
available, and outstanding balances (for accounts in use) were less than
half the credit line.
Measures of collection experience on consumer borrowing presented a
mixed picture in the first quarter. The delinquency rate on closed-end
consumer loans at banks increased a bit to 2.4 percent, about the midpoint
of its range over the past 14 years, while delinquencies on bank
credit cards climbed to a series high of 3.4 percent. Delinquencies at
auto finance companies edged up during the quarter to about the 1986
average rate-high for recent years but well below the levels of 1979-80.
Mortgage loans past due 60 days or more continued to fall off from the
record level reached in the second quarter of 1986, but remain elevated by
historical standards.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Despite reports of continuing negative sentiment for the long-
term, selling pressure on the dollar abated during the intermeeting
period. Since May 19, the weighted-average value of the dollar has
risen about 2-3/4 percent, on balance, with the dollar firming nearly 5
percent against the yen and 2-3/4 percent against the mark. The dollar
rose sharply in late May amid somewhat easier monetary conditions in
Germany and Japan and continuing perceptions that U.S. monetary
conditions had tightened somewhat in late April. Further impetus was
given to the dollar following the release of the Japanese budget
package. A temporary dip occurred after the announcement of Chairman
Volcker's resignation in early June, and some selling pressure emerged
in the runup to the Venice Summit. But the dollar subsequently rose to
its recent highs on better-than-expected economic data for U.S.
inflation, production, and payments imbalances. It has since retreated
somewhat amid rumors of central bank intervention to restrain the
dollar, as some market participants reportedly concluded that specific
target ranges had been agreed to in Venice and that the dollar was
approaching the upper limit of these ranges.
Even as the dollar strengthened over the period, long-term
interest-rate differentials between U.S. and foreign securities
narrowed sharply. Differentials between U.S. and German rates have
decreased about 90 basis points to a level of about 275 basis points,
and the U.S.-Japanese differential declined about 120 basis points to a
level of about 460 basis points. The rise of long-term interest rates

in Japan may reflect reported concerns that recent money growth might
prompt some future monetary restraint. Short-term interest-rate
differentials have moved in the same direction as the lo..g-term
interest-rate differentials, though less sharply. The weighted-average
of foreign three-month interest rates rose about 10 basis points, while
the rates on 3-month Treasury bills were about unchanged and on U.S.
90-day CDs fell about 25. In other interest-rate developments, French
authorities lowered the money-market intervention rate and the 7-day
repurchase rate 1/4 point during this period to 7-1/2 percent and 8
percent, respectively. These cuts took place as upward pressure on the
franc moved it closer to the top of the EMS bilateral parity grid.
On May 19, the Desk purchased
$133 million against marks to counter selling pressure that had arisen
following the announcement by Citibank that it would increase its loan-
loss reserves by $3 billion. In the only other occurrence of
intervention by U.S. authorities during this period, the Desk purchased
$410 million against marks and $103 million against yen following the
announcement on June 2 of Chairman Volcker's resignation.
The dollar price of gold dropped about 4-1/2 percent since the
beginning of this period, to a level of $449.50, while silver prices
retreated about 22 percent to a level of $7.26.

IV-4
U.S. bank lending to foreigners in the first quarter. U.S.-
chartered banks' claims on foreigners rose $4.1 billion in nominal
terms in the first quarter of 1987. However, after adjustment for the
effect of a 6.3 percent decline in the average exchange value of the
dollar on the dollar value of nondollar claims, total claims on
foreigners at constant exchange rates are estimated to have declined
by $3 billion. Revised data show that nominal claims for 1986 fell
$200 million, and exchange rate adjusted claims fell $9 billion.
The nominal value of claims on non-OPEC developing countries
rose $0.6 billion in the first quarter. This included an increase in
claims of $0.3 billion in Latin America and a $0.2 billion on Asia
and Africa. The increase in claims on Latin America was more than
accounted for by a $0.4 billion recorded increase in claims on Brazil
during the first quarter. This increase appears to reflect in large
part interest accrued on Brazilian loans that was not paid after the
suspension of interest payments on medium- and long-term debts to banks
that was announced on February 20. As these loans are placed on a non-
accrual accounting basis, which will take place by the end of the
second quarter of 1987, a recorded reduction in claims on Brazil may
appear in the data, if banks subtract this accrued interest from their
reported balance sheets.
OECD data on publically announced medium- and long-term
international bank loans show a strong increase in new syndicated bank
loans so far in 1987. For the first five months of the year,
syndicated lending increased by $74 billion on an annual basis, 27
percent greater than such lending for the year 1986. Press accounts
have drawn attention to renewed interest in syndicated loans on the
part of borrowers from major industrial countries, particularly those

Although Morgan Guaranty was the lead manager for a $5 billion
syndicated credit for British Petroleum in March, a transaction that

participation in syndicated lending. Nominal claims on the G-10
countries increased by $5.1 billion in the first quarter. However,
valuation and seasonal effects may have accounted for a large portion
of the increase. Moreover, syndicated credits are not necessarily
fully drawn down on the date of their public announcement, and would
not be reflected in the U.S. bank claims data until dispersements are
made. It is, nevertheless, possible that the behavior of U.S. banks
has changed and that they are not bidding for as large a share of
traditional international syndicated loans as they have in the past.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Official reserve assets held in the United States by the foreign

continued,
Partial information for May from the FRBNY indicates that
G-10 reserves in the United States continued to increase,
The bulk of the increase in official reserve assets in the United
States in April, as well as in the first quarter, was in the form of
holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. (See line 4b.) Almost half of
the increase in Treasury securities consisted of bills and
certificates, while somewhat more than half was bonds and notes.
Private foreigners, in contrast, sold almost $7 billion net in U.S.
Treasury securities (mostly bonds and notes) in the first four months
of 1987. (See line 3.) Japanese residents sold $3.1 billion net in
April, after selling $1.7 billion net in the first quarter.
Foreign private inflows through other securities transactions
(line 2) in April continued at almost the same rate as in 1986 and the
first quarter of 1987, although below the high March levels. Foreign
private purchases of U.S. corporate bonds (line 2a) were down somewhat,
and are unlikely to recover soon since new issue activity in the
Eurobond markets has been deterred by higher interest rates since

March. Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate stock (line 2b) were still
strong in April, but below the March peak rate. Japanese residents
have purchased $5 billion net in U.S. stocks in the first four months
of 1987, more than they purchased in all of 1986. U.S. purchases of
foreign securities (line 2c) increased somewhat in April.
The large net inflow reported by banks in the first quarter of
1987 was partially reversed in April (line 1), largely because of net
outflows to affiliated banks outside the United States. As indicated
on the International Banking Data table (line 1), these inflows resumed
in May. For the first five months of 1987 as a whole, large net
inflows from own foreign offices were concentrated at the large money-
center banks. They were probably related both to the placement of
large sums by foreign central banks in the Euromarkets during this
period and to variations in the funding needs of banks in the United
States; apart from April, core deposit growth has been slow.
Another notable development in recent months has been the rapid
growth of international intermediation denominated in currencies other
than the dollar. Foreign-currency denominated claims on and
liabilities to foreigners at banks in the United States (many of them
foreign-based) grew by almost 25 percent in the first quarter of 1987;
valuation changes resulting from the depreciation of the dollar explain
only part of this increase. (However, foreign-currency claims and
liabilities remain a small percentage of total claims and liabilities.)
Foreign-currency denominated Eurobonds issued by U.S. corporations
increased from 22 percent of new Euro-issues by U.S. corporations in
1985 to 28 percent in 1986 and 36 percent in the first five months of
1987. In the Eurobond markets as a whole, dollar-denominated bonds
accounted for only about one-third of new issues in the first five

months of 1987, compared with more than half in 1986 and about two-
thirds in 1985. In the U.S. domestic bond market, there were 20
foreign-currency denominated bond issues by U.S. corporations in the
first quarter, equivalent to $1.3 billion.
The Department of Commerce recently released data on U.S.
international transactions in the first quarter of 1987. Direct
investment abroad (line 6 on the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table) was unusually large: reinvested earnings were
inflated by unrealized currency translation gains associated with the
depreciation of the dollar and there were substantial repayments of
intercompany debt to Netherlands Antilles finance affiliates, largely
related to the retirement of Eurobonds that had been issued in earlier
years by these affiliates. Additional bond retirements and outflows to
Netherlands Antilles finance affiliates are likely this year since the
Treasury Department just renounced (effective January 1, 1988) the tax
treaty with the Netherlands Antilles, subjecting future interest
payments associated with Eurobonds issued there before mid-1984 to a
withholding tax. The statistical discrepancy (line 10) and foreign
private purchases of U.S. Treasury securities (line 3) do not match the
data as published by the Department of Commerce in June because of the
correction of a large error in reports of net purchases of U.S.
Treasury securities by the World Bank.

merchandise trade deficit in the first quarter was $153 billion (AR) --
virtually the same as the deficit in the fourth quarter of last year
(see tables below). The April trade deficit, measured on a not-
seasonally-adjusted, Census basis, was somewhat smaller than the
monthly average for the first quarter. The staff estimates that on a
seasonally-adjusted, balance-of-payments basis the April trade deficit
will be $140 billion.

For the first quarter of 1987, non-agricultural exports increased
by 3.5 percent from the fourth-quarter value. The increase was in
industrial supplies (especially lumber and chemicals), in consumer
goods, and in exports of automobile parts to Mexico and other non-
Canadian destinations. Exports of machinery continued at about the
same elevated rate as in the fourth quarter (about 5 percent above
levels recorded a year earlier). A similar pattern of expansion of
exports appears in the April data. Some items, such as general
machinery and chemicals, showed continued growth from March and first-
quarter values.
The growth in non-agricultural exports is attributed primarily to
the increased international competitiveness of U.S. exports resulting
from the decline in the exchange value of the dollar; income growth
abroad in 1986 and early 1987 has been relatively sluggish. Most of
the increase in non-agricultural exports in the first quarter went to
Canada and to Western Europe, increasing in each case by 8 percent. In
addition, even though the appreciation of the yen has brought no
improvement in U.S. exports to Japan, U.S. exports to Korea and

IV-14
Singapore expanded by 15-20 percent in the first quarter, suggesting a
substitution toward U.S. suppliers.
Agricultural exports declined somewhat in the first quarter of
1987 from strong fourth-quarter levels, particularly because of a fall
in the volume of soybean exports. But they were up in April, buoyed by
increased shipments of corn to the USSR. Overall, however, the
performance of agricultural exports has been anemic over the past year.
Agricultural prices have continued to fall, bringing the total decline
since the first quarter of 1986 to 12 percent. Moreover, non-tariff
barriers covering nearly 40 percent of agricultural trade and increased
production world-wide suggest that shifts in the competitiveness of
U.S. agricultural exports that result from lower support prices and the
decline in the dollar may not lead to a sustained improvement in export
volume.
The value of oil imports increased by 8 percent in the first
quarter, but fell back in April. The price of imported oil has
continued to rise, as OPEC countries have acted to limit oil production
and raise prices. Prices were up 23 percent in the first quarter, and
rose again in April, bringing the total price rise since December 1986
to $3.80 per barrel. However, the increase in price was partly offset
by a 12 percent decline in the volume imported in the first quarter and
a further decline in April (see table).

For non-oil imports, a similar pattern emerges of price increases
and volume declines. In the first quarter, price increases barely
offset a decline in volume, resulting in virtually no increase in the
value of non-oil imports. For April, the value of non-oil imports
fell.
Across product categories, small increases in the value of
imports in the first quarter were recorded in industrial supplies
(particularly paper, building materials, and steel), machinery,
automotive parts (from Japan, Mexico, and Canada), and consumer goods
(especially textiles). For April, the overall decline in the value of
non-oil imports was offset by increases in passenger cars (especially
from Japan as a new quota-year began), and consumer goods (especially
apparel).
Prices of non-oil imports have continued to rise, with the
strongest increases in the first quarter in capital goods, consumer
goods, and automotive products (see table). Increases in certain
categories of imports result in large part from the delayed passing-
through of the change in the value of the dollar into import prices.
Prices of imports of capital goods have been rising steadily throughout
1986, as a majority of these imports come from countries whose

IV-16
currencies have been rising the most against the dollar -- namely
Western Europe and Japan. Evidence that profit margins have been
squeezed to levels last seen in the late 1970s suggests that price
increases will continue.

Quantitative restrictions are also an important determinant of
import prices. In particular, price hikes for autos result from both
exchange rate effects and the Japanese voluntary restraint agreement.
Recent price increases for textiles and apparel probably results more
from the broadened protection of the recently renegotiated Multifiber
Arrangement and various bilateral agreements with significant
suppliers.
Current Account
The current account improved slightly in the first quarter of
1987 from the rate recorded in the fourth quarter of 1986 (see table).
There were small improvements in the balances on merchandise trade and
military transactions and a reduction in unilateral transfers (largely
U.S. government grants to developing countries). Offsetting these
gains was a reduction in net direct investment income as the increase

IV-17
in income receipts from abroad was more than offset by increases in
income payments on a higher level of foreign direct investment in the
United States. In addition, capital gains on U.S. direct investment
holdings fell and capital gains on foreign direct investment in the
United States turned around in the first quarter from losses in the
fourth quarter of 1986. These gains are due primarily to valuation
changes associated with movements in the foreign exchange value of the
dollar.

Developments in the Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in the foreign industrial countries has
generally remained sluggish so farthis year although real GNP
increased sharply in Japan and the United Kingdom during the first
quarter. In France growth of output continued to be weak. In Germany
both real GNP and industrial production fell sharply in the first
quarter although industrial production rebounded somewhat in April. In
Italy real GDP declined in the first quarter, and in Canada expansion
in industrial production declined in April after strong growth in the
first quarter. Consumer price inflation remained relatively low
abroad, but has recently increased slightly in Japan, France, Canada,
and Italy. Trade and current account surpluses are very large in Japan
and Germany, but data on trade volumes show continued adjustment of
exports and imports to the higher values of the yen and the German
mark. Meanwhile, trade balances improved in the United Kingdom and
Canada, and deteriorated sharply in France and Italy.
Individual Country Notes.
In Japan, real GNP grew 4.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter following a revised 2.9 percent increase in the fourth quarter
of 1986. Growth in private consumption expenditure and plant and
equipment spending more than offset a decline in government consumption
spending. Real exports on a national income basis rose as real imports
fell, resulting in a substantial net stimulus to growth from the
external sector. Other more recent economic indicators present a mixed
picture. On the positive side were increases in April and May in
retail sales and an increase in April in housing starts, both
suggesting a continuation of moderate growth. On the negative side

IV-22
were declines in industrial production in April and May and an increase
in May in the unemployment rate to a new record level of 3.2 percent
(s.a.).
Although consumer prices rose in the second quarter above the
level a year ago, the all-commodities index of wholesale prices has
continued to decline and in the three months ending in May were 6
percent below the year-earlier level. Preliminary reports of this
years' average wage settlement indicated an increase in wages of 3.6
percent, one percentage point below last years' wage increase. In
addition, import prices were 11.6 percent lower in April from year-
earlier levels. Japan's trade surplus narrowed in May, bringing the
cumulative trade surplus for the first five months to $89.1 billion
(s.a.a.r.). Export volume dropped 6 percent while import volume rose 3
percent in May from year-earlier levels. The cumulative current
account surplus for the first four months of 1987 totaled $95.9 billion
(s.a.a.r.).
More than three months behind schedule, the Japanese parliament in
May passed a budget for FY 1987 that maintains the generally austere
fiscal stance that has characterized recent years. In the face of
strong opposition to the sales tax portion of the tax reform proposal,
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) agreed to exclude the entire tax
reform package from the regular budget and to allow a parliamentary
committee to consider the issue. The committee will be empowered to
adopt, modify or abandon the sales tax. On May 29, Japan announced a 6
trillion yen ($42 billion) "Emergency Economic Package" to stimulate
its economy. The size of the package is equivalent to 1.8 percent of
nominal GNP. At the heart of the package is 5 trillion yen ($35

IV-23
billion) in public sector outlays, of which nearly one-half are
designated as public works projects financed by the central government.
Tax reductions amounting to at least 1 trillion yen ($7 billion) in the
fiscal year (ending in March 31, 1988) constitute the balance of the
planned stimulus measures. The Ministry of Finance has proposed a
supplementary budget to provide the financing for the measures
contained in the package. The budget provides for additional issue of
construction bonds plus some use of revenues from the sales of shares
in Nippon Telephone and Telegraph to finance that part of the economic
package that is increased central government spending. The
supplementary budget will be presented to an extraordinary session of
the Diet that will convene in early July. The 1 trillion yen tax cut
has been deferred to a second supplementary budget due later this year.
In Germany real GNP dropped 3.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter. Construction spending plummeted more than 40 percent, due to
unusually severe weather, and private consumption expenditures declined
due to a decrease in automobile sales, the result of the expiration at
the end of the year of tax incentives for car buyers. Exports
declined, but imports declined even more, resulting in a positive net
external contribution to GNP growth. Data for April suggest that some
rebound in economic activity may be underway. In that month industrial
production rose 3.6 percent (s.a.), with construction rebounding and
other manufacturing output showing strength. New orders rose 4.8
percent (s.a.) largely on the strength of foreign orders, which in turn
rose 8.5 percent to return to the level reached in April 1986. The
consumption climate index recovered the ground it lost earlier this
year, suggesting some underlying strength in private consumption.

IV-24
Similarly, business sentiment strengthened but remained below its year-
earlier level. In addition, the rate of unemployment in May fell to
8.8 percent from 8.9 percent in April.
Consumer prices rose in June to a level about equal to June 1986.
Through April, import prices declined at an annual rate of 0.6 percent,
compared with a pace of 11.4 percent in the second half of last year.
This slowdown in the pace of price declines is also evident in
wholesale and producers prices.
The trade surplus in May was $5.9 billion (n.s.a.), bringing the
cumulative trade surplus through May to $25.9 billion, compared with
$18 billion for the same period of last year. The cumulative current
account surplus through May was $18.2 billion, compared with $13
billion a year ago. The volume of exports through April this year was
2 percent below a year ago, while the import volume had risen by 2.5
percent.
In the United Kingdom Prime Minister Thatcher's Conservative
government easily won an additional five-year term in the June 11
parliamentary elections. The re-elected government has announced that
the existing macroeconomic policy framework will be continued.
Legislative proposals for the new parliament include reform of the
education and municipal tax systems and a loosening of rent controls.
In Canada, the government introduced in Parliament a proposal for
comprehensive tax reform to take effect January 1988. Reform will
proceed in two stages, the first altering the personal and corporate
income tax systems (by lowering rates and broadening the bases) and the
second substituting a national sales tax (yet to be defined) for a
manufacturers' sales tax. Overall, the proposal is being sold as

IV-25
revenue neutral and reduces personal income taxes while increasing
corporate income taxes and sales taxes. Although the government has a
large majority in both houses, tax reform is such a volatile issue that
the government cannot be certain of getting it through Parliament.

IV-26
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Brazil has announced a broad ranging package of stabilization
measures amid hopes that the plan will win approval of the IMF and
break the deadlock with the commercial banks. Mexico's current account
and international reserves have shown considerable strength in the
first four months of the year. Commitments to Argentina's new money
package with the commercial banks now exceed 96 percent of the $1.95
billion sought. The World Bank suspended disbursements to Peru in
early May. In June, policy disagreements led to the ouster of the
president and the general manager of Peru's central bank and to the
subsequent resignation of the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.
The Philippine authorities have announced that they will not seek to
reopen the loan negotiations with commercial banks, reversing their
April statement that they intended to do so. The Cote d'Ivoire, which
has been hurt by recent declines in export prices, has suspended
service payments on its external debt pending negotiations with its
creditors. Panama, which is seeking a restructuring of its debt to
official creditors, has suspended service payments on such debt pending
a Paris Club agreement.
Individual Country Notes. In mid-June, Brazil's President Sarney
and Finance Minister Bresser announced a broad ranging package of
stabilization measures. The package included a 9.5 percent increase in
the cruzado price of the dollar (in addition to continued daily mini-
devaluations), a price freeze for a maximum of 90 days (after sharp
increases in public sector prices), a new program of wage restraint, a
6-month deferral of several large government investment projects, the
elimination of the wheat subsidy, increased central bank control of

IV-27
money growth, and an end to its ability to finance subsidies and
development programs. The devaluation appears to restore the
competitiveness of the exchange rate. The new wage policy involves a
freeze of up to 90 days, termination of the salary trigger (although
wages will be increased at the end of June for May inflation up to a
maximum of 20 percent), and no adjustment for inflation for the first
half of June, which implies a substantial reduction in real wages.
Official pronouncements following introduction of the new program
indicate that Brazil hopes that the new economic plan will win some
form of approval by the IMF and break the deadlock with the commercial
banks. An IMF mission is visiting Brazil and talks with commercial
banks are scheduled for later in July. Since the plan was announced,
nominal interest rates have fallen dramatically, with real rates
remaining stable, and the stock market has rallied.
In light of Brazil's new adjustment program, Paris Club creditors
agreed to postpone from mid-July to mid-September the date by which
Brazil must meet certain conditions in order to reschedule principal
payments due in the first half of 1987. On July 1, Brazil announced
that it was unable to make principal payments to the Paris Club in
1987, but would continue to make interest payments.
There are signs that Brazil's trade surplus is strengthening. In
April the trade surplus was $520 million, only slightly smaller than
the trade surplus for all of the first quarter. In May, the trade
surplus jumped again to $950 million. There are reports of weakness in
industrial activity. This weakness has resulted in significant lay-
offs over the last several weeks.

IV-28
In the first four months of 1987, Mexico's current account was in
surplus by nearly $2 billion, and reserves, excluding gold, rose by
nearly $6 billion, including the initial $3 billion net drawing on the
new bank loans at the end of April. In the first five months of 1987,
the merchandise trade surplus was about $4.4 billion, more than twice
as high as in the same period in 1986. Petroleum exports were up by 35
percent and non-oil exports by 24 percent; imports were down by 10
percent. Exports of manufactured goods were especially strong, with a
rise of 47 percent. Some signs of economic recovery have appeared, but
first-quarter manufacturing production was still about 3-3/4 percent
lower than a year earlier, a decline large enough to meet the condition
for the activation of the $500 million contingency growth facility that
is part of the bank financing package. In May, the peso price of the
dollar rose by 7 percent and consumer prices by 7.5 percent. During
the latest 12 months, consumer prices have risen by 125 percent and the
peso price of the dollar by 136 percent. Interest rates on time
deposits, which were reduced steadily from early March to mid-May, have
remained unchanged since then. At the end of June, the rate on 90-day
deposits was 90.85 percent, giving an effective annual yield of 140
percent. Treasury bill rates have moved in a narrow range since mid-
May. At the June 23 auction, the rate on 91-day bills was 98.3
percent, giving an effective annual yield of 141 percent. Mexico
has met the performance criteria of its IMF stand-by arrangement
through March 31.
As of the end of June, commitments to Argentina's new money
package with the commercial banks were over 96 percent of the $1.95
billion sought. The monthly rate of increase in consumer prices, which

IV-29
averaged 7.4 percent during the first quarter of 1987, fell to 3.4
percent in April and 4.2 percent in lay when the CPI was 103 percent
higher than a year earlier. Real ex-post interest rates on free-rate
bank loans remain very high--about 3 percent monthly or 40 percent
annually at the end of May. In the first half of 1987, Argentina's
fiscal deficit including central bank operating losses appears to have
been about 6 percent of GDP, compared with the 4 percent ceiling
specified in its IMF stand-by arrangement. Argentina may also have had
difficulty meeting performance criteria for Treasury outlays, domestic
credit, and real interest rates on regulated-rate deposits. The Fund
staff has completed a mid-term review of compliance with the stand-by
arrangement and the Argentine authorities appear to be cooperating in
getting the program back on track. A Compensatory Financing Facility
disbursement is expected by mid-July to pay off the official bridge
loan of $500 million that Argentina received in early March.
The World Bank suspended disbursements to Peru in early May after
arrears had lengthened to more than 75 days. Peru had stopped making
interest payments to the World Bank in line with its policy of not
making debt service payments to creditors that are not expected to
provide net new financing. On June 12, President Garcia forced the
resignation of the president of the Central Bank and of its general
manager over a disagreement regarding the management of the country's
exchange rate. In late June, Luis Alva Castro, Prime Minister and
Finance Minister, also resigned reportedly because of concern over
declining international reserves and excessive government spending.
President Garcia is being advised to stimulate the economy and to
protect the reserves, which, excluding gold, are equivalent to less

IV-30
than four months' imports of goods and services, by further reducing
payments to foreign creditors. Since the second half of 1985, Peru has
restricted debt service payments to the equivalent of 10 percent of
merchandise exports. In the first quarter of 1987, real GDP was nearly
14 percent higher than a year earlier but virtually unchanged from the
fourth quarter of 1986. There are some indications of a slowdown after
the first two months of 1987.
On June 10, the Philippine authorities announced that they would
not seek to reopen the loan negotiations with commercial bank creditors
that were concluded in late March. This reverses a previous statement
that they intended to do so in view of a slightly lower spread granted
to Argentina. The Philippine economy, which began to recover in the
second half of 1986, continued to grow in the first quarter of this
year, with real GDP up 5.8 percent over the same period a year earlier.
The rate of inflation has remained low, with the April CPI up only 1
percent over April 1986. During the first four months of this year,
imports rose faster than exports, and the trade deficit increased to
$252 million from $193 million in the same period a year earlier.
The Cote d'Ivoire announced in late May that it could no longer
service its external debt on existing terms and that it was suspending
payments on it pending negotiations with creditors to revise its
external financing arrangements. It took this action in view of the
recent decline in prices for coffee and cocoa, its principal exports.
The country's current account deficit is projected to rise this year to
about $700 million (6 percent of GDP) from $120 million in 1986.
