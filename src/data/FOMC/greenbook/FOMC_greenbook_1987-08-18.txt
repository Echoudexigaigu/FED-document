DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity appears to have expanded moderately in recent
months. Labor demand has been strong, and the unemployment rate has
declined further. The industrial sector appears to be benefiting from
increased international competitiveness; moreover, improving shipments
and orders trends in manufacturing, outside of autos, are providing some
impetus to domestic equipment spending. However, growth of real personal
income has remained weak, and consumer spending rather sluggish. On the
whole, the consumer and producer price indexes have registered less rapid
increases in the past couple of months, despite adverse movements in food
and energy prices, and wage trends have been stable.
Employment and Unemployment
The July household and establishment surveys both confirmed a
continued strong trend in employment growth. Moreover, contrary to the
general expectation, the June drop in the unemployment rate not only held
up, but was extended by another tenth of a percent last month.
According to the establishment survey, nonfarm payroll employment
rose about 300,000 in July, with job gains widespread by industry. In manu-
facturing, the number of factory jobs was up 70,000 last month despite a
decline of nearly 40,000 in the automobile industry, where model change-
overs and production cuts led to some temporary layoffs. The pickup in
manufacturing employment followed several months of small increases and
has brought the number of factory jobs back to the level of early 1986.
In the service-producing sector, employment growth showed renewed vigor.
Employment in finance and services rose 100,000 in July, close to the

average monthly gain over the first half of this year, and hiring at trade
establishments picked up in July from its sluggish pace in May and June.
Recent gains in employment as measured by the household survey have
been larger than those seen in the establishment survey, averaging 340,000
per month over the last four months. In addition, the unemployment rate
has dropped sharply in recent months and, at 6.0 percent among civilians,
now stands 0.7 percentage point below last December's level. Jobless
rates have fallen substantially for almost all demographic groups. While
the drop in the unemployment rate has been surprisingly sharp, given
available estimates of output growth, the tenor of anecdotal evidence
suggests that a significant tightening of labor markets has been occurring.
Industrial Production
Industrial production appears to have posted a sizable gain in July.
The July payroll report showed increased labor input across a broad range
of manufacturing industries. In addition, production of raw steel rose
9-1/2 percent in July, truck assemblies were up more than 7 percent, and
oil and gas drilling advanced. These gains were only partly offset by a
further decline in auto production-to a 6.7 million unit annual rate.
Overall, a number of industries--such as steel, machinery, chemicals,
textiles, and paper--likely have been benefiting in recent months from
developments in the external sector and increased demand for capital
equipment.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal personal income picked up somewhat in the first half of
1987, rising about 7 percent at an annual rate. Wages and salaries

were supported by sizable gains in employment, and interest and nonfarm
proprietors' income moved up. In addition, the level of farm proprietors'
income was about $50 billion at an annual rate, nearly $15 billion above
the 1986 average. Real income gains, however, remained small as the ac-
celeration in consumer prices erased much of the nominal gain; after
adjustment for inflation, disposable personal income rose only about 1
percent over the first six months of the year.
Consumer spending remained relatively sluggish in the second quarter.
Real personal consumption expenditures increased roughly 2 percent, about
half the recorded amount during the 1984-86 period. Spending on services
expanded at a robust pace in the second quarter, reflecting strong gains in
most major categories. In addition, outlays for motor vehicles rebounded
some from the sharp first-quarter decline. Purchases of other goods were
down, with large declines in real purchases of food and apparel. Although
the severity of the spending decline for these items appears somewhat
questionable, demand for clothing and shoes may indeed have been damped
by large increases in prices.
Consumers spent an historically large proportion of current dispos-
able income in the second quarter, as the saving rate fell to 3.2 percent,
from an upward-revised level of 4.4 percent in the first quarter. The
sharp drop in the saving rate in the second quarter is partly attributable
to the extraordinary one-time tax payments in April. The average saving
rate in May and June-after the April bulge in tax payments--was about
4-1/4 percent, close to the average for 1986 as a whole. Nonetheless, the
saving rate in recent quarters has remained low on an historical basis,

II-8
suggesting that increases in net worth have provided substantial impetus
to spending in a period of slow income growth.
Motor Vehicles
Total auto sales registered a 10.5 million unit annual rate in
July, about the same pace that has prevailed, on average, since February.
Sales of domestically produced cars were unchanged at a 7.2 million unit
rate last month, while sales of foreign cars moved up to a 3.3 million
unit pace. Domestic production in July was 6.7 million units at an annual
rate. Current schedules call for assemblies to be just a touch below
this level during the rest of the summer, but that output pace would be
the lowest in any quarter since mid-1983.
Production adjustments in recent months have helped to draw dealers'
stocks down a little, but at the end of July inventories still represented
a hefty 76 days' supply at last month's sales pace. Stocks are particularly
high at General Motors, and on August 5, GM sweetened their existing incen-
tive programs. The new programs cover almost all GM cars and include rebates
and finance rates as low as 1.9 percent on two-year loans. Ford and
Chrysler followed suit later in the week.
Although purchases of new autos have been sluggish in recent months,
light-duty truck sales have remained brisk. Over the first seven months
of 1987, sales of such vehicles, which include vans and small pickups
that have come increasingly to substitute for consumer purchases of cars,
almost matched the strong pace of 1986. In July, sales of domestically
produced light trucks totaled 4.1 million units, while sales of imported
trucks, most of which are light-duty models, recorded a 1 million unit

annual sales rate. Incentives were available on some trucks in the past
few months; the GM and Ford programs expired in early August and have not
yet been renewed, while Chrysler's most recent plan remains in effect.
Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for business fixed investment posted a sizable gain
in the second quarter, reversing much of the tax-related decline in
spending earlier in the year. Equipment outlays accounted for all of the
second-quarter advance, boosted by a rebound in purchases of office and
computing equipment and stronger truck sales. Despite this bounceback,
equipment outlays are now estimated to have been little different from
year-ago levels.
Spending for nonresidential structures edged down during the second
quarter. The office sector continued to be quite weak; since peaking in
mid-1985, outlays for office construction have fallen nearly 30 percent.
However, spending in other sectors was up, on balance; notably, petroleum
drilling activity expanded for the third straight quarter, in response to
rising oil prices.
Recent indicators of future investment outlays generally have been
favorable. New orders for nondefense capital goods rose 8-1/2 percent in
the second quarter. Even excluding the sharp advance in the aircraft
component,1 new orders increased more than 5 percent, after having shown
little net change over the preceding 2-1/2 years. Also, the backlog of

group. Most important, orders for aircraft and parts contain little
information about near-term shipments because they are filled with long
lags--often more than five years. Also, a sizable share of aircraft
shipments ends up as exports or intermediate inputs (the latter owing to
the presence of aircraft parts) rather than as equipment spending.

unfilled orders excluding the aircraft group has edged up in recent
months. For nonresidential construction, new commitments remained firm
through June, supported by gains in the institutional sector (which
includes private educational and religious buildings and hospitals).
Outside the institutional sector, new commitments have continued to trend
down, but the pace of decline has slowed considerably. Vacancy rates for
both office buildings and hotels remain at extremely high levels, suggesting
further declines in outlays in these sectors.
Business Inventories
Inventory investment apart from autos picked up in the spring.
However, given improving sales and shipments in a number of sectors, the
inventory-sales ratio was little changed between February and May.
Manufacturers' inventories have risen a bit over the past several
months, after two years of liquidations. Nonetheless, these stocks
continued to run relatively lean compared with factory shipments: the
ratio of inventories to sales for all manufacturing (measured at current
cost) fell in June to its lowest level in the current expansion. Such
accumulation in factory stocks as there was in recent months was largely
concentrated in the earlier stages of processing, and, in light of orders
trends, may reflect anticipations of future increases in production.
In the trade sector, the pace of nonauto inventory accumulation
quickened in the spring. Wholesale inventories increased moderately for
the second quarter in a row. At the retail level, data are available
only through May; and, apart from automobile dealers, show few, if any,
signs of serious imbalances.

Housing Markets
Housing activity has softened in recent months. Total private
housing starts were virtually unchanged in June at 1.6 million units
(seasonally adjusted annual rate), the lowest level since 1984. Multi-
family starts-at 1/2 million units or less since early spring-continue
to be damped by near-record levels of vacancies in rental properties.
Single-family activity also has weakened recently, reflecting the higher
average level of mortgage interest rates, with both starts and sales well
below the levels of earlier in the year.
Despite weak sales, some measures of new house prices have accel-
erated in recent months. In particular, the average sales price for new
homes soared in June to 26 percent above its year-earlier level. However,
this reading may overstate substantially the true movement in home prices,
in part because the figure for June 1986 was abnormally low. Moreover,
much of the rise in the average sales price appears to reflect increases
in size and amenities that affect home costs as well as some change in
the regional mix of home sales; the Census Bureau's constant quality
price index, which controls for both of these factors, has risen only 2
percent over the past four quarters, compared with a 13 percent increase
in the unadjusted price measure. Finally, informal reports suggest that
some less affluent buyers may have dropped out of the market for new
homes--contributing to both the fall in new home sales and the high
average price--in part because home prices in many areas have outrun the
loan limits on government-backed mortgages.1
1. The FHA will not insure a home loan for more than $90,000 (and only
then in areas designated as having high home costs). The VA does not
have a loan size limit, but only guarantees the first $27,500 of any loan;
effectively, this places an upper bound of $110,000 on most VA-insured
loans, as secondary market purchasers require at least 25 percent of the
loan to be backed by owner's equity, or a loan guarantee.

Federal Government
Work on FY1988 budget legislation continues to lag behind the offi-
cial congressional schedule. After passing the Budget Resolution, Congress
turned its attention to the goal of revitalizing the Gramm-Rudman Act by
setting more realistic deficit targets and restoring an automatic spending
cut mechanism. The Senate amended legislation extending the debt ceiling
with a Gramm-Rudman "fix" in late July, but the Conference Committee failed
to reconcile the Senate amendment with features desired by the House
before Congress left on its summer recess last Friday. Congress did
temporarily extend the debt ceiling to September 23, and the Gramm-Rudman
conferees are expected to make further attempts to reach agreement before
that date. Meanwhile, the regular appropriations process has been slowed
down, and the major legislative elements that would implement the FY1988
Budget Resolution have yet to be specified.1
The Gramm-Rudman "fixes" being considered by the Conference Committee
would increase intermediate deficit target levels, extend the deadline
for a balanced budget by one or two years, and restore for at least two
years the vehicle for automatic spending cuts by having the Office of
Management and Budget rather than the General Accounting Office certify any
required sequester order.2 The President would be given some discretion in
allocating automatic defense cuts among defense categories.
1. To date, the House has passed only 9 of the 13 regular appropriations
bills and the Senate has not yet acted on any. The deadline for committee
action on the reconciliation instructions in the Budget Resolution has been
extended from July 28 to September 29 (the regular budget process calls for
work on reconciliation to be completed by June 15).
2. The Supreme Court ruled the General Accounting Office's role in the
sequester process unconstitutional because it is a legislative rather than
an executive agency.

Major differences between the Senate and House conferees include
the amount of deficit reduction that must be enacted for 1988 and the
number of years over which the sequester mechanism is to remain in effect.
Conferees have proposed a suspension of the automatic spending reduction
in FY1988 if Congress cuts $23 billion or more from the CBO baseline.
In comparison, the Budget Resolution specified cuts of $37 billion.
The deficit in the federal sector of the national income accounts
declined sharply in the second quarter, primarily because of large final
payments on 1986 personal income tax liabilities associated in part with
higher capital gains realizations late last year. On the spending side,
growth in real defense purchases was boosted to an 8 percent annual rate
by a catch-up in deliveries that had been delayed late last year. Non-
defense purchases, however, remained depressed by large redemptions by
farmers of surplus farm stocks, and there was a sharp decline in farm
subsidy payments from unusually high first-quarter levels.
The upward revision to personal income (discussed in Appendix A) alters
somewhat the interpretation of this spring's unusually large tax payments.
The higher nominal income implies that regular tax liabilities in 1986 were
larger than previously thought, and temporary tax reform effects were
correspondingly smaller. Personal tax liabilities in 1987 now appear to be
higher as well, suggesting somewhat larger final payments in April 1988.
The upward revision to the level of wage and salaries also helps to explain
the strength of withheld tax collections during the first half of 1987.
The downward revisions of corporate profits data for 1986 and 1987-Q1 have
only a small effect on the federal revenue outlook, because much of the

II-19
change was attributable to new information on depreciation; revisions to
reported profits (on which taxes are based) were much smaller.
State and Local Governments
Purchases of goods and serviced by state and local governments are
estimated to have increased at a 3.4 percent annual pace in real terms in
the second quarter, compared with a 5 percent rise in the first quarter.
A sharp reduction in growth of outlays for construction accounted for all
of the second-quarter slowdown. Overall, sizable increases in real pur-
chases have continued despite budgetary erosion in many states over the
past year and fiscal crises in a few energy-dependent states, especially
Texas and Alaska.
The operating and capital account balance (excluding social insurance
funds) turned slightly negative at the end of last year after more than
three years of surplus. The deficit reached a $9 billion annual rate in
the first quarter, the largest since early 1975; another, somewhat smaller
deficit apparently occurred in the second quarter.
With concern about budgetary positions mounting, many states raised
sales and excise taxes in fiscal 1987, which ended June 30 for most govern-
ments. In addition, a number of states altered their personal income tax
code in some way, reflecting a desire to return at least part of the tax
windfall expected from the base-broadening effect of federal tax reform.
Some cities, too, have been experiencing fiscal stress and have re-
acted by cutting back spending or by raising revenues. More than a third
of cities participating in a recent survey increased taxes and about half
raised user fees and other nontax charges during the past year.

II-20
Prices
Inflation in June was boosted by developments in the food and
energy sectors. However, prices of other goods were little changed-at
both the consumer and producer levels-and consumer service prices rose
less than in recent months. On net, the CPI total was up 0.4 percent in
June, about the average pace since February, while the PPI for finished
goods slowed to a 0.2 percent increase. So far this year, the CPI has
risen at about a 5-1/2 percent annual rate, compared with only 1 percent
last year.
Consumer food prices rose 0.7 percent in June, after advancing 0.5
percent in May, led by large increases for meats and for fresh fruits and
vegetables. The increase for meats reflected the passthrough to the retail
level of higher livestock prices this spring. Futures prices suggest a
general expectation of some easing in coming months of recent tight meat
supplies, especially for pork products. Producer prices of crude foods
overall turned down in June and probably fell sharply in July. The retail
impact of the fall in crude food prices may be damped, however, owing to
the large share of nonfarm costs in food production and the tendency of
retailers to smooth out farm price fluctuations.
Energy prices picked up in June, as most of the May-June increases
in crude oil costs were passed on to the refinery and retail levels. Spot
market and posted prices for crude increased somewhat further in July,
as market developments were affected by fears of a disruption of supplies
from the Persian Gulf region. Nevertheless, OPEC apparently has increased
its oil production, suggesting that prices may soften if tensions ease.

Excluding food and energy items, the CPI slowed further in June.
The commodities component leveled off as decreases in apparel prices offset
increases for motor vehicles and medical care commodities. The drop in
apparel prices reflected discountingof spring and summer clothing, after
very large increases earlier this year. Detail from the BLS import price
index for June confirms that price increases for foreign-source apparel
have been sizable. Import prices also have continued to rise rapidly for
a variety of other consumer goods, including photographic equipment,
pharmaceuticals, and glassware and chinaware.
Prices of nonenergy services rose only 0.2 percent in June. This
CPI component has risen at about a 4-1/2 percent rate during the first
half of this year, down from 5-1/4 percent in 1986. Smaller increases in
rents and auto insurance rates, as well as declines in long-distance
telephone rates, account for most of the deceleration, but prices of some
other services also rose less than last year.
Domestic producer prices for finished consumer goods less food and
energy show little indication of a response to higher import prices.
This PPI component was little changed in June, as well as over the second
quarter. Its average pace so far this year, of about 1-1/2 percent at an
annual rate, is below that of last year. Similarly, the PPI for capital
equipment was flat in June and has risen little this year, despite rapid
increases in prices of imported capital goods.
By contrast, prices of intermediate materials (also less food and
energy) rose 0.5 percent in June and at about a 4 percent annual rate
since December, after two years of little change. Although the recent
acceleration has been sharpest for chemicals and other petroleum-related

II-23
materials, it was evident for other industries as well, notably for
metals and paper. Acceleration also can be observed in the recent BLS
export price indexes for materials, particularly for chemicals and non-
ferrous metals. Moreover, import prices have risen rapidly this year for
a broad range of materials, including most primary materials. On the
whole, the data are consistent with reports from industrial purchasing
managers of rising input prices.
Wages and Labor Costs
Several recent indicators suggest that employment costs continue to
rise at a comparatively moderate pace. The year-over-year change in hourly
compensation in the private nonfarm sector, as measured by the employment
cost index (ECI), was 3.0 percent in June, about the same as in the pre-
ceding few observations. Available evidence suggests that benefits con-
tinue to advance at about the same pace as wages and salaries. According
to the BLS, recent trends in benefit costs largely reflect the net effect
of lower pension costs and higher insurance costs.
Compensation in service-producing industries appears to have accel-
erated somewhat over the first half of this year after a sharp slowdown
in 1986. In contrast, compensation gains for workers in goods-producing
industries remained quite moderate in the first half of the year, owing
primarily to small wage increases for manufacturing workers. By occupation,
increases in compensation for white-collar workers continued to outpace
gains for blue-collar workers by a substantial margin. Separately, the
hourly earnings index for production and nonsupervisory workers rose 0.2
percent in July, about the same as the average over the first half of this
year and similar to the trend in blue-collar wages as reported in the ECI.

For workers in unions, compensation-as measured by the ECI-has
increased about 2 percent over the past year. Separate data on collective
bargaining activity under major contracts (1,000 or more workers) also show
only moderate increases, with first-year adjustments (excluding potential
COLAs) averaging 2.1 percent and adjustments over the life of the contract
averaging 2.5 percent annually. Overall union wages, as measured by the
effective wage change series for major contracts, rose at a 2.8 percent
annual rate in the first half of 1987, compared with 2.3 percent last
year. This year's increase primarily reflects wage adjustments negotiated
under prior contracts, owing to greater backloading in recent years. How-
ever, wage increases due to COLAs also picked up a bit in the first half
of this year, responding to the rise in the CPI. Initial wage adjustments
contributed very little to overall union wage inflation, because of the
relative y small number of workers negotiating new agreements in the first
half of this year.
Indeed, the recent postal service agreement and the upcoming settle-
ment in the auto industry together cover more workers than all of the
contracts negotiated in the first six months of this year combined. The
postal service agreement calls for a series of wage increases totaling
about 7 percent over the 40 months of the contract, and retains the
current COLA provisions, which effectively pass through about 60 percent
of price increases into wages. In the auto industry, where contract
talks have opened at GM and Ford, negotiations likely will be centered
on job security. The union has announced plans to focus talks on limiting
outsourcing and overtime and may try to modify the profit-sharing formula
at GM, where workers received no payments for last year despite reported

II-26
company profits of almost $3 billion. The auto companies likely will
seek to reduce labor costs through improvements in plant productivity
and wage restraint. Typically, the talks move slowly until late August
when the UAW executive board meets to single out one of the companies as
a strike target. Union negotiators then concentrate their efforts at the
target company for a settlement that will serve as a pattern for the
other firm. Contracts at both companies expire on September 14.
Preliminary data for the nonfarm business sector indicate that
productivity rose 1.4 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter,
after a 0.4 percent increase in the first quarter. With the second-quarter
release, productivity and cost estimates have been revised back to 1984
to reflect the revisions to the NIPA and to the employment data compiled
from the establishment survey. As a result of the revisions, average
annual productivity growth for 1984-86 was revised upward by 0.7 percen-
tage point; over the current cyclical expansion, productivity has risen
at a 1-3/4 percent annual rate. In addition, compensation growth in 1986
was revised up to 3.4 percent, closer to the ECI figures. Based on the
new productivity and compensation estimates, unit labor costs grew 3.7
percent in 1985 and 1.9 percent in 1986, essentially unchanged from
earlier figures.

APPENDIX A*
ANNUAL REVISION OF THE NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS
The Commerce Department in July released its annual revision of the
National Income and Product Accounts. The revision covers the past three
years and incorporates new source data and updated seasonal factors. The
revisions to GNP primarily reflect the incorporation of newly available
information from the Census Bureau's annual surveys of wholesale and retail
trade, services, manufacturing, and state and local governments. The
changes to the income side of the accounts largely are based on data from
the state unemployment insurance system, farm statistics, and government
regulatory reports on financial institutions.
The revised figures indicate that real GNP increased somewhat more
rapidly than previously estimated, but continue to portray the period
since 1984 as one of moderating growth accompanied by slower inflation.
Real GNP now is estimated to have increased about 5 percent in 1984 and
3-1/4 percent in 1985, about 1/2 percentage point per year above the
previous estimates, while growth in 1986 was raised 1/4 percentage point
to 2-1/4 percent. In contrast, the growth rate for 1987-Q1 was lowered a
bit, from 4.8 to 4.4 percent at an annual rate. Taken together, the revi-
sions added about 1 percent to the level of economic activity in 1987-Q1.
Changes to aggregate inflation measures generally were small, with the
GNP fixed-weight price index still rising slightly more than 3-1/2 percent
per year in 1984 and 1985 and about 2-1/4 percent last year.
The upward revision to real GNP mainly is attributable to higher
personal consumption expenditures, which are now estimated to have
increased more than 4 percent in each of the past three years. Outlays
for services were raised to reflect new information on the use of medical
services and the introduction of video rentals into the recreational
services category. Net purchases of used cars by households also were
revised up, but in this case the higher consumption was largely offset by
a reduction in the motor vehicles component of business investment.1 In
addition to the change in consumer spending, there were noticeable upward
revisions to purchases by state and local governments since 1984 and non-
farm inventory investment in 1986 and 1987-Q1.
The only sizable downward revision was to business fixed investment.
The change was primarily in purchases of producers' durable equipment,
which were reduced by the sectoral reallocation of outlays for used cars
mentioned above and by lower spending for most other types of capital
goods. However, a reassessment of recent trends in computer prices
(taking into account quality improvements), in conjunction with higher

1. Excluding retail and wholesale margins, expenditures on used items
generally have no effect on GNP, which measures only current production.
In this instance, new data on fleet ownership indicated that a higher
volume of used cars had been sold by business and purchased by consumers.

II-A-2
nominal shipments, led to substantially larger estimates of real purchases
of such items; computers and office equipment now account for about one-
fourth of overall equipment spending.
On the income side of the accounts, there were sizable revisions to
both the level and distribution of income, especially for the most recent
years. These new figures imply a substantial shift of income from corpor-
ations to households (and noncorporate businesses), which added more than
2 percent to the level of real disposable personal income in 1987-Q1.
The additional household income was concentrated in interest receipts and
farm proprietors' income. Wages and salaries also were raised, while
employer payments for fringe benefits (primarily pension benefits) were
lowered. In 1984 and 1985, the revisions to disposable income were not
as large as the changes to consumer spending, and the personal saving
rate was reduced somewhat. In 1986 and 1987-Q1, however, the changes to
income were considerably larger, and the saving rate was raised, especially
in the most recent quarters. Nonetheless, at only about 4 percent of
disposable income, on average, over the past year-and-a-half, personal
saving remains low on a historical basis.
Meanwhile, there was a sizable downward revision to corporate profits;
economic profits-which include the capital consumption and inventory
valuation adjustments and thus measure earnings from current production--
were reduced by $16 billion in 1986 and $41 billion in 1987-Q1. In part,
the revision was attributable to lower reported earnings in the domestic
financial and rest-of-world sectors. In addition, BEA cut its estimate
of the capital consumption adjustment to reflect newly available data on
depreciation from IRS tabulations of corporate tax returns; this narrowed
the gap between the reported and economic measures of profits. As a share
of nominal GNP, profits now appear to have hovered around 6-3/4 percent
since early 1986, a bit below the 1985 average. In contrast, the previous
figures had indicated a marked uptrend over the past year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
A slight decline in the federal funds rate has had a favorable effect
in the private money markets, but interest rates on most intermediate- and
long-term securities have risen considerably since the July FOMC meeting.
Developments in the Persian Gulf area have raised concerns about a poten-
tial price shock from the energy sector. And, while the dollar has strength-
ened further, competing interest rates abroad have risen sharply. In the
Treasury market, which has been hurt as well by debt-ceiling disruptions,
bond yields have increased about 1/2 percentage point from their levels
at the time of the FOMC meeting. Corporate bond rates have risen a little
less than Treasury yields, and municipal rates considerably less. Treasury
bill rates have increased 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point, on net, reflecting
shifting supply conditions, while most other short-term rates are about
unchanged to down 1/8 of a point. Shrugging off the rise in nominal bond
yields, the stock market has continued to soar.
The monetary aggregates grew little in July, and M2 and M3 moved
farther below their annual target ranges. A small further drop in demand
deposits held down M1, and growth in the more liquid deposit components
of M2 generally has been restrained by the availability of more attractive
yields on alternative assets. M3 expansion was damped last month by
declines in managed liabilities as bank asset expansion was negligible.
Debt growth, like monetary growth, appears to be on a slower growth
track this year. In July, although bond issuance by nonfinancial firms
remained fairly strong, driven primarily by the need to fund corporate
share retirements, a part of this borrowing financed paydowns of short-
term debt. Federal debt declined, on net, in July when statutory debt

limitations in midmonth forced the Treasury to postpone several auctions
and to suspend issuance of savings bonds and other nonmarketable securities
until the end of the month; borrowing accelerated again around the end of
the month and in early August when temporary debt ceiling extensions per-
mitted the Treasury to make up the postponed auctions. Tax-exempt bond
offerings have dropped off substantially after a surge in June. In the
household sector, use of home equity lines appears to be cutting into
consumer credit expansion, but other mortgage borrowing is being damped
by the higher interest rates that are deterring homebuilding.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M1 was essentially flat in July after dropping sharply in June.
Runoffs of demand deposits continued, but at a much slower pace, and
moderate inflows into other checkable deposits (OCDs) resumed. To some
extent, the recent weakness in demand deposits liely has reflected
downward adjustments to compensating balances and reduced mortgage
refinancing activity. OCD growth may have been encouraged by a slight
narrowing of spreads between their yields and those on market instruments
and small time deposits.
Growth in M2 picked up a little in July, to a 3 percent annual rate,
as the effect of somewhat slower growth in its nontransactions components
was offset by the turnaround in M1. The increase this year in the oppor-
tunity cost of holding liquid deposits has continued to cause substitutions
among the components of M2 and, moreover, to boost M2 velocity. Savings
deposits decelerated for the third consecutive month in July, to a 5 per-
cent rate, the slowest pace since February 1986, while small time deposits
grew at a double-digit rate for the second consecutive month. As in June,

inflows to small time deposit accounts at banks in July were especially
strong in Districts 1 and 2, where relatively high rates continued to be
posted on such deposits.
Growth in M3 weakened to a 2 percent annual rate in July. Bank
credit was essentially flat, allowing the institutions to reduce their
reliance on managed liabilities, even in the face of sluggish core
deposit growth and a shift of $8 billion of funds by banks to their
offshore branches. A runoff in large time deposits at banks offset
moderate growth at thrifts. At insolvent Texas thrifts, however, large
time deposits continued to decline slightly, contributing to a shrinkage
in total deposits. Eurodollar deposits and RPs also declined in July.
Preliminary data on bank credit for July indicate little movement
in either investments or total loans. Business loans declined during the
month after growing at about a 4-1/2 percent annual rate over the second
quarter, with weakness particularly evident at several money center
banks. Despite continued strong growth in home equity loans, real estate
loan growth slowed to a 13 percent pace, down from the 20 percent rate of
May and June, mainly reflecting a slowdown at large banks. Consumer
loans edged up slightly after dipping in June.
Corporate Finance
Revisions to the national income accounts suggest that the gap
between capital expenditures and internally generated funds in the non-
financial corporate sector has been running a bit wider than previously
indicated.1 Nonetheless, that gap has not been large, and it is clear
1. The NIPA revisions show lower levels of both corporate profits and
fixed investment, the downward adjustment in the former being the larger.

that the major factor behind business borrowing has been the financing of
mergers, buyouts, and share repurchases. Indeed, the pace of share
retirements picked up to an estimated $135 billion annual rate in the
second quarter.
Most recently, in July, the outstanding volume of business loans
and commercial paper fell, in part reflecting the repayment of short-term
debt utilized earlier to fund restructurings until assets could be sold or
permanent financing could be arranged. Public bond issuance by nonfinancial
corporations continued strong; about $4-1/2 billion of below investment
grade debt was issued domestically during the month, and similar volume is
expected this month as spreads of junk bond yields over those of higher
quality bonds have not widened appreciably.
In the Euromarket, bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations
picked up in July from the depressed June level to a pace in line with
the second-quarter average. The Eurobond market was shaken by the
Treasury's June 29 announcement that it was cancelling its tax treaty
with the Netherlands Antilles. About $30 to $35 billion of bonds issued
before August 1984--when U.S. withholding tax rules were changed--were
affected. With the expiration of the treaty, the U.S. parents of the
Caribbean subsidiaries that issued the bonds would have been subjected to
new taxes. Most of the bonds were callable in the event of such tax
changes, and because the bonds had been issued when interest rates were
higher, the call prices were below market prices and investors would have
suffered large losses. The Treasury later reversed itself, however, and
virtually all issuers that had called their bonds rescinded their calls;

prices rebounded, but generally have remained below earlier levels because
of residual uncertainty about the future tax status of these bonds.
In he equity markets, stock prices have gained 6 to 9 percent, on
average, over the intermeeting period, with all major indexes reaching
new highs. Despite the increases, new share offerings dipped in July,
though they remained at historically high levels. The volume of new
convertible bond offerings also was down in July.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff is projecting a total federal budget deficit of $44
billion in the current quarter. The Treasury is expected to borrow
$36 billion, net, from the public; it has continued to raise funds through
coupon issues, while paying down bills, although the pace of bill paydowns
has begun to diminish.
The Treasury was forced to suspend issuance of SLGS and savings
bonds and to postpone several auctions as a result of the reduction in
the debt ceiling from $2.315 to $2.111 trillion at midnight on July 17.
The Treasury resumed issuance of securities on July 29 when the debt
ceiling was increased temporarily and extended through August 6. Thus,
of the nearly $16 billion in bill paydowns in July, about $14 billion was
made up early in August when an extra, catch-up bill auction was held.
On August 8, the debt ceiling was further extended to September 23 at a
level of $2.35 trillion. This second temporary extension has enabled the
Treasury to conduct its previously postponed mid-quarter refunding
operation; 3-, 10-, and 30-year issues are being auctioned this week to
raise about $17 billion in net new money.

Borrowing by the federally sponsored agencies in the third quarter
is expected to slow a bit from the second-quarter pace. The Federal Home
Loan Banks, which had accounted for the bulk of agency issuance through
June, apparently reduced their borrowig in July and are expected to
continue to slow their pace of issuance during the current quarter as
advances to thrifts ease from the brisk second-quarter pace. FNMA is
expected to continue to pay down debt in the third quarter, after
retiring $700 million in the second quarter when an increase in loan
prepayments reduced the need for financing. The Farm Credit System also
is expected to continue to pay down debt in the face of slack loan demand.
President Reagan this week signed into law a wide-ranging banking
bill that provides authority for the insolvent FSLIC to acquire $10.8
billion of additional funds. This bill may have assuaged market fears
that FHLB creditworthiness would be compromised by the problems of the
FSLIC. In any event, the most recent FHLB securities were issued at
narrower spreads over Treasury securities than those of comparable
issues priced in July. The spreads between Farm Credit and Treasury
securities also have narrowed recently as a congressional bailout
bill appears in the works and amid signs that the farm economy may
be improving. In late July, the Farm Credit System's offerings of 3-
and 6-month bonds were priced at spreads of 95 and 77 basis points
over comparable Treasuries, a narrowing of 25 and 16 basis points,
respectively, from those at the time of the previous pricing.

III-12
Municipal Securities Markets
Offerings of long-term tax-exempt bonds slowed last month after a
strong resurgence in June that accompanied a drop-back in yields from the
May highs. The lower pace of issuance has persisted into early August.
Both new-capital and refunding volumes were lighter in July, with the
temporary suspension of SLGS issuance, noted above, a factor inhibiting
advance refunding deals. Offerings to raise new capital have been reduced
this year, owing largely to provisions in the tax reform legislation
that tightened arbitrage restrictions and further limited issuance of
private-purpose bonds.

In contrast to the slowing in the issuance of long-term securities,
gross issuance of short-term tax-exempt securities--mainly tax and revenue
anticipation notes (TRANs)--has continued strong in recent months as many
governments have refinanced maturing notes issued for cash flow purposes.
The ability of the municipal bond market to outperform the taxable
market recently evidently reflects at least in part a swing in bond-fund
activity. Open-end bond funds returned to the market in June as they

III-13
experienced net inflows of over $1-1/4 billion after two months of net
outflows. Anecdotal evidence suggests that positive inflows persisted
through July. Additional demand for tax-exempt securities during the
recent period came from several newly created closed-end municipal funds;
the John Nuveen fund, at $1.5 billion, is the largest to date.

An investigation by several federal agencies into the sale of up
to $12 billion in tax-exempt securities has had little effect on the
tax-exempt securities market as a whole. The bonds in question were
offered in late 1985 or during the summer of 1986 to beat anticipated tax
law changes; the suspicion is that the motivation for the issues was to
capture still-allowable arbitrage profits rather than to finance capital
projects.
Mortgage Markets
Primary mortgage interest rates have changed little during the
intermeeting period. Contract rates on fixed-rate home loan commitments
have fluctuated between 10-1/4 and 10-3/8 percent-still about 1-1/4
percentage points above the March lows. Initial rates on one-year
adjustable rate mortgages have risen only fractionally since March,

III-14
however, and the initial rate advantage of ARMs has run at about 2-1/2
percentage points in recent weeks-close to the record 2-3/4 percent
level reached in mid-1984 when ARMs briefly captured two-thirds of the
market. The ARM share of new conventional mortgage lending has doubled
in recent months. In early July, half of all conventional loans closed
for the purchase of single-family homes carried adjustable rates-the
largest proportion since late 1985.
The competitive position of ARMs also has been enhanced by the
increased availability of convertible ARMs, which allow borrowers the
option of converting to fixed-rate loans at some point during the life of
their loan. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC have been buying and swapping a
wider variety of ARM products this year, increasing the liquidity of this
market.
The rise in fixed-rate mortgage rates in recent months has resulted
in a moderation in the pace of refinancings. In June, refinancings
accounted for 28 percent of all mortgage loans originated by FSLIC-insured
institutions, off from the record 40 percent in March, but still high by
historical standards. The waves of refinancings during the past two years
have contributed to a dramatic lowering of interest rates on mortgage
debt outstanding. For instance, at the beginning of 1986, a full 46
percent of the $200 billion of FHA/VA fixed-rate level payment home mort-
gages pooled into GNMA securities carried interest rates of 12 percent or
higher; the volume of such securities outstanding has declined by more
than half.
The easing in the pace of refinancings and the slackening in
real estate activity have resulted in lower gross lending volumes.

III-15
Applications for FHA home loans were off in June from a month earlier and
were only slightly more than half the volume in June of last year. At
FSLIC-insured institutions, mortgage originations were up only slightly
in June, despite the sharp market shift toward ARMs, a product in which
thrift institutions normally are market leaders.
The slower pace of lending also is evident in the volume of new
issues of mortgage pass-through securities. Issuance dropped 10 percent
in June, and continued moderation seems likely. In contrast to the
slowdown in pass-through issuance, offerings of derivative mortgage
securities have rebounded from a May lull. These derivative products,
most of which have federally related pass-throughs as collateral, include
the now familiar CMOs and more recent innovations such as senior and
subordinated classes backed by conventional loans. With the renewed
activity of the past two months, gross public issuance of these securities
over the first seven months of the year has neared the $60 billion total
issuance of 1986.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit grew at an annual rate of 7 percent in
June, after declining slightly in May. Growth in the first half of the
year averaged just 3 percent, at an annual rate.
The slowdown in consumer credit this year has stemmed in part from
the sluggishness of consumer spending, but it also reflects a shift by
some households from use of consumer credit to borrowing against home
equity lines of credit. Based on data received since June from the
regular weekly and monthly reporting banks, it appears that all commercial
banks may have held somewhere around $25 billion in revolving home equity

January 1987, mortgage assets held by FSLIC-insured institutions, as reported
to the FHLB Board, excluded loans in process and other contra assets. Since
then, however, these mortgage data have been reported by thrifts to include
contra assets. As a result, the net changes in mortgage assets since the
beginning of this year reflect the new gross reporting procedure implemented by
the FHLB Board.

debt at midyear.1 Banks are widely recognized as commanding the largest
share of the home equity line market, although the size of that share
cannot be gauged with much precision. A recent Board-sponsored survey of
households by the University of Michigan found that about 45 percent of
the home equity lines held by respondents had been issued by a bank;2
other industry observers place the bank share at over 60 percent. A bank
share of 45 percent would point to an aggregate estimate of $50 to $60
billion outstanding at midyear, up dramatically from the $40 billion or
so estimated to have been outstanding at the end of 1986. However, if
the bank share is as high as 60 percent, then the total market would seem
to be smaller than previously thought. In either case, the data point to
a pattern of rapid growth: large weekly reporting banks averaged a
compound annual growth rate of close to 85 percent for home equity line
balances over a five-week period dating from mid-June. These considerations
suggest that borrowing under home equity lines likely has been reducing
consumer credit growth by several percentage points.
The recent revisions in GNP statistics have resulted in a downward
adjustment in the ratio of consumer installment credit outstanding to dis-
posable personal income, an oft-cited measure of household debt burden.
The ratio has been lowered by 0.4 to 0.5 percentage points for recent
months. The cyclical (and historical) peak of last fall now is estimated
1. Until data on revolving home equity debt become available on the quar-
terly Report of Condition (probably on the December report), the sample-
based estimate will entail a fairly wide margin of error.
2. Because relatively few households (about 4 percent) have a home equity
line, this indication of market share is based on a very small number of
observations (52).

III-18
at 18.9, still surpassing the previous peak of 16.4 reached in 1979.1 In
June, after several months of weak growth in consumer credit, the debt
burden ratio was down to 18.5 percent.
1. Estimates of repayment burdens generally have shown less of a rise
during the recent upswing than has the outstandings-based measure and are
slightly below the previous peak. To a large extent, this result stems
from a lengthening of debt maturities.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dollar has
appreciated 2-1/2 percent on balance since the last FOMC meeting, as
shown in the upper panel of Chart 1. Early in the intermeeting period,
continued optimism about adjustment in U.S. external accounts provided
support for the dollar. But the dollar fell sharply in mid-July
following the release of U.S. trade data that disappointed these
expectations. Subsequently, the dollar has recovered strongly, buoyed
by growing tensions in the Middle East and reports of better-than-
expected U.S. economic activity.
The dollar appreciated despite a general narrowing of interest
rate differentials that favor dollar-denominated assets. Short-term
interest rates in the United States -- shown in the table at the bottom
of Chart 1 -- are little changed since the last FOMC meeting, while a
weighted-average of comparable foreign rates has risen 20 basis points.
In Germany, three-month interest rates have firmed 30 basis points. As
selling pressure on the dollar abated further, the Bundesbank has taken
the opportunity to tighten monetary conditions, perhaps providing it
room to maneuver should exchange rate pressures resurface. The key
rate on its securities repurchase agreements was edged up to 3.6
percent in late July from the 3.55 percent that had prevailed since
mid-May. Elsewhere, short-term interest rates in Canada were boosted
60 basis points to counter downward pressure on the Canadian dollar
that had developed following losses for the Conservative Party in the
latest by-election. In the United Kingdom, concern about rapid credit
growth and a possible overheating of the economy motivated the Bank of

England to raise its money-market dealing rates by a full percentage
point in early August. Major U.K. clearing banks responded with a
comparable increase in their base lending rates to a level of 10
percent.
During the intermeeting period, bond yields generally rose
worldwide, but the increase in yields in Japan was particularly acute.
The yield on the bellwether 10-year bond in Japan surged to 5.4 percent
reflecting stronger-than-expected economic activity and perceived
concern by the Bank of Japan about rapid money growth, but since has
dropped back to 5.0 percent as the latest money supply figures indicate
a slight slowing in the growth of M2 plus CDs. On balance, these
yields are up 90 basis points over the intermeeting period. During the
same interval, long-term interest rates in the United States rose about
1/2 percentage point, while yields in Germany advanced only 35 basis
points. With the sharp rise in long-term interest rates bolstering the
yen, the dollar firmed only 1 percent against the yen, compared with 3
percent against the mark.

slightly larger net gain, ending the intermeeting period at just below

U.S. International Financial Transactions
U.S. banks reported a small capital inflow in the second quarter,
bringing the total inflow through banking offices for the first half of
1987 to $9.8 billion. (See line 1 of the Summary table.) Though small
in total, the month-to-month flows in the second quarter were large and
variable. In April U.S. banks reported a $3.3 billion outflow; in May
they reported a $9.1 billion inflow. At the end of June, U.S. banks
increased their claims on their own foreign offices to produce an
outflow of $5.4 billion; banking data on transactions with own foreign
offices for July indicate that these claims have remained at their
higher levels. (See line 1 of the International Banking table.) The
inflow in May coincided with large Euromarket deposits by foreign
central bank and slow core deposit growth at money center banks. The
outflows in June and July, which were concentrated at several money
center banks, coincided with a rundown in Eurodollar deposits of U.S.
residents and weak loan demand at money center banks.
Recorded inflows due to official transactions (line 4 of the
Summary table) were small in May and June, bringing the total inflow
for the second quarter to $9.4 billion.

OPEC reserves in the United States continued to decline in
the second quarter, despite more favorable oil market conditions,
probably reflecting movements to diversify the currency composition of
reserve assets.
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States
of all other countries were virtually unchanged in the second quarter.
On July 15 Taiwan liberalized its foreign exchange controls
making it easier for residents to invest abroad. The aim of the new
policy is to reduce official reserves, now estimated at $61 billion.
Under the new rules, private foreign exchange transactions for the
current account are no longer subject to prior official approval;
capital account transactions that result in capital outflows are not
subject to prior approval when they are for less than $1 million per
transaction and cumulate to less than $5 million per year per account.
The likely effect of this change on U.S. capital flows depends on the
extent to which the private portfolio preferences differ from those of
the Taiwanese authorities. Although recent diversification has reduced
the share of dollar assets in Taiwan's official portfolio to about 80
percent in May from 93 percent a year earlier, it is likely that the
official portfolio is more heavily weighted toward dollar assets, and
U.S. Treasury securities in particular, than will be the private
portfolio that will replace part of it if the new program is
successful.

Net private securities transactions produced an inflow of $13.5
billion in the second quarter of 1987 as net purchases of corporate
securities (line 2 of the Summary table) more than offset net sales of
Treasury securities (line 3). This shift out of Treasury securities
into corporate assets continues a pattern seen since the third quarter
of 1986 and brings total foreign private net sales of Treasury
securities in the first half of 1987 to $3.8 billion. The trend out of
Treasury securities may have been reversed in June, however, as the
World Bank recorded net purchases of $3.4 billion and Japanese
residents recorded net purchases of $3 billion. In the first half of
1987, more than half of the foreign investment in U.S. corporate
securities has been in stocks, compared with about a quarter in 1986.
This shift toward stocks has been particularly pronounced for
investment from Asia where stocks accounted for 84 percent of the net
purchases of corporate securities in 1987, compared with 34 percent in
1986. Reports from the Bank of Japan indicate that Japanese private
demand for U.S. stocks and corporate bonds accelerated in July. U.S.
residents sold $1.7 billion net of foreign securities in June, probably
in response to a firmer dollar. These sales offset the net purchases
in the April and May to produce a net outflow of $0.5 billion for the
second quarter.

Merchandise Trade
Data for the merchandise trade balance for June will be issued on
August 14, and will be discussed in the Greenbook supplement.
Available data for April and May suggest that on a seasonally adjusted,
balance-of-payments basis the April-May average deficit was about $147
billion, marginally smaller than the deficit in the first quarter (see
table below).

The average value of both exports and imports increased in April-
May from first-quarter levels. Agricultural exports rose by 10
percent, boosted by strong exports of corn to the Soviet Union. (Data
for agricultural shipments in June are also expected to be buoyed by
shipments of wheat to the USSR.) The rise in non-agricultural exports
(about 6 percent in value) appears to have been largely an increase in

IV-11
volume, as export prices of manufactured goods rose little. Exports of
machinery, chemicals and consumer goods appear to have been
particularly strong. The rise in imports for April-May (about 2
percent from first-quarter levels) was largely in oil and passenger
cars from Japan and South Korea. Import prices continued to climb in
the second quarter according to preliminary data, accounting for much
of the rise in value.
The value of oil imports increased in May by about $6 billion to
about $40 billion, at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate. (See table
below.) Prices edged up to $17.20 per barrel reflecting increased
demand for oil stocks, increased tension in the Middle East, and Saudi
Arabian restrictions on liftings by Aramco partners. The volume of oil
imports increased to an average of 6.4 million barrels per day.

Import and Export Prices (BLS Measures)
The pattern of increases in the prices of imports and exports in
the first half of 1987 reflects the increase in the price of oil since
late last year, a strengthening in world commodity prices, the regional

IV-12
distribution of the dollar's depreciation, and the sectoral
distribution of barriers to trade. Among the several measures of price
movements are the survey-of-transactions price indexes compiled by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. These prices are one of several components
incorporated in the calculation of the deflators and fixed-weight
indexes used to analyze the trade and GNP accounts.
According to the BLS price indexes, non-oil import prices
increased at a 10.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter; prices
of non-oil imports averaged about 8.8 percent higher than a year
earlier (Q2/Q2). (See table below.)

IV-13
The prices of imported industrial materials, excluding oil,
increased at a 14.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter,
significantly faster than in previous quarters. Within this category,
increases in prices of chemicals, fertilizers, and other petroleum-
based intermediate materials were most notable. Prices increased as
well for unfinished imported textile products, which are restrained
under the Multifiber Arrangement.
The decline of the dollar against the currencies of the other G-
10 countries continues to be reflected in increases in the prices of
goods that are imported primarily from Japan and Western Europe.
Prices of non-automotive capital goods rose at an 8.8 percent annual
rate on average in the second quarter; prices of non-automotive capital
goods were 10.4 percent higher than a year earlier (Q2/Q2). Within
this category, increases in prices of machine tools (restrained by
voluntary agreements) and in the prices of construction and special-
purpose machinery were particularly notable.
Average prices of imports of consumer goods rose somewhat more
than did prices of capital goods -- increasing 11.2 percent at an
annual rate in the second quarter. Prices for consumer goods were 10.3
percent higher than a year earlier (Q2/Q2). In particular, prices
increased for textile products, chinaware, photographic equipment, and
pharmaceuticals, reflecting quantitative restraints, changes in the
value of the dollar, and the increase in oil prices.
Movements in prices of U.S. exports continue to be dominated by
price developments in the domestic U.S. economy. However, within
certain sectors, export prices appear to have been influenced by
changes in world prices for oil and other commodities, and by
increasingly competitive pricing by foreign exporters to third markets.

IV- 14
U.S. export prices increased by only 3.3 percent during the last year
(Q2/Q2), although in the second quarter, export prices surged by 11.2
percent at an annual rate. The significant increase in prices in the
industrial materials category (which jumped by an average of 20 percent
at an annual rate in the second quarter) was paced by large increases
in chemicals, certain metals (especially silver and iron and steel),
and agricultural materials (especially cotton).
Increases in the prices of exports of capital goods have been
muted, increasing on average only 1.9 percent over the year (Q2/Q2),
and only 1.6 percent, at an annual rate, in the second quarter. In the
fight for international markets, U.S. exporters may be exercising
restraint in their pricing policies as they compete against aggressive
foreign producers who are reducing export prices measured in their
domestic currencies.
Increases in the prices of exports of consumer goods also have
been small, increasing only 2.5 percent in the last year (Q2/Q2), and
less than 1 percent, at an annual rate, in the second quarter. In
fact, export prices have fallen in several sensitive sectors, such as
electronic goods, where the competition includes firms of the newly
industrializing countries whose currencies have appreciated relatively
little against the dollar.

IV-15
Developments in the Foreign Industrial Countries
The pace of economic activity abroad appears to have rebounded on
average in the second quarter from its sluggish pace earlier in the
year. In the United Kingdom, recent data indicate continued broad-based
strength in economic activity, while German industrial production in the
second quarter retraced its steep decline of the first quarter. In
contrast, growth in Japan and, perhaps, in Canada appears to have slowed
from the robust first-quarter rates. While for the second quarter as a
whole growth in Japan was sluggish, data available so far for June
suggest some pickup in economic activity.
Consumer price inflation remains low abroad but prices have
continued to increase relative to year-earlier levels in most major
industrial economies. Moreover, year-over-year increases in wholesale
or producer prices have picked up in the United Kingdom, Canada, and
Italy, and the rate of decline in Japanese, German, and French producer
prices has slowed. Trade and current account surpluses remain very
large in Japan and Germany, but data on trade volumes indicate continued
real adjustment in both exports and imports. Trade balances
deteriorated recently in Italy, France and the United Kingdom, but
improved in Canada.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, recent data indicate that
growth has slowed substantially in the second quarter from the rapid
pace of the first quarter. Industrial production declined 0.5 percent
(s.a.) in the second quarter, and the unemployment rate averaged a
record 3.1 percent (s.a.). However, industrial production grew 3.4
percent (s.a.) in June and the inventory-to-shipments ratio declined.
In four of the first five months of 1987, total private new machinery

IV-19
orders (s.a.) declined, including a sizable drop in May. The consumer
and housing sectors show signs of strength. Retail sales rose strongly
in May to a level 8.4 percent above the May 1986 level. After sluggish
growth earlier this year, new housing starts picked up in the second
quarter: new housing starts in April and May were on average 4.6
percent (s.a.) higher than in the first quarter.
Inflation remains low in Japan. For the three months ending July,
consumer prices were a modest 0.4 percent above their level for the
comparable period in 1986. However this represents some pickup in
inflation from the first quarter when consumer prices were 0.5 percent
below their year-earlier level. The rate of decline of wholesale prices
has slowed markedly in recent months. In June, the all-commodities
index of wholesale prices was 4.2 percent below the year-earlier level.
Japan's trade surplus (s.a.) declined in dollar terms in May and June
but then increased in July. For the first seven months of 1987, the
cumulative trade surplus was $84 billion (s.a.a.r.) while the cumulative
current account surplus for the first six months was $90.8 billion
(s.a.a.r.). In the first seven months of this year, export volume was
2.5 percent below, and import volume was 5.4 percent above, their year-
earlier levels.
In July, the Diet passed a 2.1 trillion yen ($14 billion)
supplemental budget for General Account spending and a 845 billion yen
($6 billion) budget for the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program to
provide financing for the core of the 6 trillion yen ($40 billion)
fiscal stimulus package announced at the end of May. This is the
largest supplemental budget in 13 years. The supplemental budget for
the General Account expenditures will be financed by 1.4 trillion yen of

IV-20
construction bonds, 460 billion yen in proceeds from the sale of shares
in NTT, and the balance from unspent funds carried over from the
previous fiscal year.
The LPD and opposition parties in the Diet recently have agreed upon
a limited version of the tax reform plan. Under the compromise plan,
the LPD agreed to expand the FY 1987 income tax reduction from 1.3 to
1.5 trillion yen (about $10 billion); to increase the size of FY 1988
tax reduction to more than 2 trillion yen ($13 billion); to postpone the
date for elimination of tax exemption on interest for small savings
accounts; and to abandon the government's plan to tax income from
workers' capital accumulation accounts. No legislation has been
suomitted authorizing corporate tax cuts or adoption of an indirect tax,
nor has a consensus emerged on how to formulate a more generalized tax
reform package.
Money growth remains rapid in Japan with M2+CDs increasing 10
percent in June relative to a year earlier. This brings the second-
quarter average growth rate of that aggregate to 10 percent over the
second quarter of 1986, exceeding the growth rate projected by the Bank
of Japan of "about 9 percent." The Japanese yield curve has steepened
in recent months. The yield on the bellwether Japanese government bond
has risen from 2.6 percent in mid-May to about 5.2 percent currently
while the 3-month Gensaki rate edged down from 3.8 to 3.7 percent.
Increased concern about future inflation, an upward revision in
expectations for economic growth, and a perception that the Bank of
Japan is now less likely to reduce the discount rate further in the near
future are cited to explain these developments.

IV-21
Industrial production in Germany fell 1.7 percent in June to a level
1.8 percent below June last year. However, increased production in the
second quarter as a whole almost offset the steep decline of the first
quarter. The swing in total production between the first and second
quarters this year occurred in large part in the construction sector,
which suffered from unusually severe winter weather early this year and
subsequently made up for earlier losses. By June, industrial production
excluding construction exceeded its level at the end of 1986 while total
industrial production was still below its end-1986 level. New orders
for manufactured goods fell nearly one percent in June, as domestic
orders declined but foreign orders increased. These data suggest that
the pace of production will be at best moderate this summer. The
business sentiment index rose in June, probably reflecting some gain in
confidence in a stabilized value of the mark in exchange markets. The
consumption climate index, on the other hand, fell in June. The rate of
unemployment through June this year remained unchanged at just below 9
percent.
Consumer prices were unchanged from June to July, while the level in
July was 0.7 percent above a year ago. Import prices, which have fallen
for two years, have risen slightly since March. This pattern is
beginning to be reflected in wholesale and producers prices, for which
the annual rates of decline have slowed in recent months. The trade
surplus in June was $4.6 billion (n.s.a.) bringing the cumulative
surplus through June to $30.5 billion, compared with $22 billion for the
same period of last year. The cumulative current account surplus
through June was $20.9 billion compared with $15.2 billion a year ago.

IV-22
The volume of exports through April--the latest available data--was 1.8
percent below a year ago, while import volume had risen 2.1 percent.
France. Official announcements concerning the 1988 budget indicate
that the government will try to cut the budget deficit further (from 2-
1/2 to 2 percent of GDP). While most categories of spending will be cut
in real terms, the budgets for defense, labor and social affairs, and
research are slated for a real increase.
Giovanni Goria formed a new Italian government on July 28. Goria, a
Christian Democrat, is the youngest Prime Minister in the history of the
Republic. His minister of the Treasury is the Socialist Giuliano Amato.
The new government is again a coalition of the five centrist parties.
The economic policies of the new government are not expected to differ
significantly from those of the previous government. However, reports
that the new government would welcome a lower exchange value of the lira
led to downward pressure in late July.
Canadian real GDP expanded rapidly in the first quarter, largely due
to strength in domestic demand. The most sizable gains occurred in
residential investment and business fixed investment, but consumer
spending was also surprisingly strong. Indicators of Canadian economic
activity in the second quarter are mixed.

IV-23
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
In late July, Brazil's Finance Minister Bresser Pereira began
discussions in the United States about Brazil's recently released
adjustment program and financing needs. Mexico reached agreement with
its bank creditors rescheduling $9 billion in private sector debt.
Argentina and the IMF have revised performance criteria in the IMF
stand-by arrangement, that was approved in principle in February 1987,
and disbursements have begun. Commitments to Argentina's $1.95 billion
new money package with commercial banks now exceed 100 percent of the
amount sought. While progress was made concerning commercial bank
agreements with the Philippines, Colombia, and Bolivia, Venezuela has
not decided whether to sign its revised public sector debt
restructuring agreement. Peru's plans to nationalize its domestic
banking system have become embroiled in judicial and legislative
dispute. Branches of foreign banks are not included in the current
nationalization plans.
Individual Country Notes. In late July, Brazil's Finance
Minister Bresser Pereira came to the United States to have preliminary
discussions with banks, U.S. government officials, and IMF and World
Bank officials, about Brazil's adjustment plans and financing needs.
Immediately before the trip, the Brazilian government released its
medium-term macroeconomic plan for 1987-1991. Under the plan, GDP
growth is targeted at 5 percent in 1987, 6 percent in 1988, and 7
percent in 1989-91. The operational fiscal deficit, that was projected
at 6.7 percent of GDP in 1987 without recent adjustments, is now
projected to be 3.5 percent in 1987 and 2 percent in 1988. According
to the plan, the government will maintain a competitive exchange rate

and positive real interest rates. Private sector investment is
projected to increase sharply as the government's deficit drops. The
trade surplus is projected at $8.6 billion in 1987 and about $10
billion annually in 1988-1991.
The issue of the IMF's involvement in any Brazilian financing and
stabilization plan has not been resolved. The Brazilian president and
finance minister appear to be trying to lay the groundwork in order
that an IMF-supported program could be accepted politically in Brazil.
Brazil plans to hold more detailed meetings with banks in September.
Mainly as a result of price controls instituted on June 12,
monthly inflation fell from 26.1 percent in June to 3.1 percent in
July. The trade surplus continued to rebound strongly with a $1.4
billion surplus recorded in both June and July.
In July 1987, Mexico and its Bank Advisory Committee reached an
agreement to reschedule $9 billion of private sector debt covered by
the FICORCA exchange-rate insurance scheme on terms comparable with
those of last September's $52 billion public sector debt rescheduling.
The debt will be rescheduled over 20 years at a spread of 13/16 of a
percentage point above LIBOR.
On July 21, Mexico accelerated its World Bank-supported trade
liberalization program. The principal step taken was the removal
ahead of schedule of official reference prices used in assessing import
duties for 528 import items, leaving only 53 items still subject to
this procedure. These prices were generally higher than actual import
prices and increased the protection in the tariff structure for covered
items. The accelerated liberalization is designed, in part, to ease
inflationary pressures and has been possible because of Mexico's

IV-25
continued accumulation of international reserves and current account
surplus. In the first half of 1987, reserves rose by about $7 billion,
including the initial $3 billion net drawing on the new bank financing,
a continuation of the return of flight capital, and a current account
surplus. In the same period, the merchandise trade surplus was about
$5.4 billion, more than twice as high as in the same period in 1986.
Petroleum exports were up by 38 percent and non-oil exports by 26
percent; imports were down by 8 percent. Exports of manufactured goods
were especially strong, with a rise of 50 percent.
Concerned about rising inflation, the government has in 1987
allowed the rate of crawl of the exchange rate to fall below the
domestic inflation rate. In July, consumer prices rose by 8.1 percent
and the peso price of the dollar by 4.8 percent. During the first
seven months of 1987, consumer prices have risen by 67 percent and the
peso price of the dollar by 53 percent. Since last November, the peso
has appreciated in real terms against the dollar by 5 percent, taking
account of U.S. inflation.
Argentina required adjustments to its stand-by arrangement (SBA)
with the IMF, that was approved in principle in February, because of
problems meeting the original performance criteria. Government
authorities agreed to policy adjustments, and the modified SBA became
effective on July 23 when the IMF Executive Board approved it after
commercial bank commitments to the new money package reached the $1.95
billion sought. In late July, the IMF disbursed the initial SDR 285
million under the SBA and SDR 519 million from the Compensatory
Financing Facility to compensate for an export shortfall in 1986 caused
by low international prices for Argentina's principal commodity

IV-26
exports. As of mid-August, commitments to Argentina's $1.95 billion
new money package with commercial banks were slightly over 100 percent
of the amount sought, although about 100 of the 330 banks, generally
those with smaller exposures, have declined to participate or have not
yet responded to requests for commitments. The final agreement is
scheduled for signing on August 21.
Despite the pressure of important congressional and gubernatorial
elections on September 6, Argentina is making forward progress with
difficult structural adjustment measures. On July 20, Economy Minister
Sourrouille announced intentions to move forward with reforms in the
areas of privatization of public sector holdings, financial sector
reforms, reductions in agricultural export taxes, improvements in the
management of public sector enterprises, and deregulation of the energy
sector. Monthly CPI inflation averaged about 6 percent over the first
five months of 1987, rising to 8 percent in June and 10 percent in
July.
In Venezuela, the President has not yet decided whether to sign
the revised public sector debt restructuring agreement with its
commercial bank creditors. The government is seeking to link signature
of the agreement to around $2 billion in new bank money for 1987-88,
but such a package is unlikely given current macroeconomic policies.
In July, an IMF team visited Venezuela in preparation for the mid-1987
review under Venezuela's enhanced surveillance arrangement with the
Fund. The Fund team told the government that current policies were
unsustainable and that it was not prepared to write a favorable report.
A World Bank mission also visited Venezuela in July to begin talks on
possible sectoral loans in support of trade policy reform.

In June, the central bank sharply tightened credit in order to
strengthen the free market bolivar and dampen inflationary pressures.
Beginning July 20, the central bank offered a 30 percent annualized
rate on short-term deposits through its desk operations. (Interest
rates on most loans by commercial banks are limited to 13 percent.) As
a result, the off-shore bolivar market has dried up and domestic banks
are rationing credit. Central Bank President Anzola is seeking an
increase in commercial bank deposit and lending interest rates, but so
far he has not succeeded in gaining support of the necessary majority
of the central bank's Board. The government is also under strong
pressure to reduce the fiscal deficit, which, given current measures,
could reach 14 percent of GDP in 1987. Inflation in June was 4.1
percent; in the second quarter prices rose at a 55 percent annual rate.
On July 17, the Philippines signed an agreement with its creditor
banks to reschedule $13.2 billion of the country's roughly $28 billion
total foreign debt. The agreement reschedules nearly $10.3 billion of
debt falling due through 1992 over 17 years, including a 7-1/2 year
grace period, and renews a $3 billion trade facility. The agreement
reduces the margin on the rescheduled debt to 7/8 of a percentage point
over LIBOR, down from a rate of 1-5/8 to 1-3/4 percentage points over
LIBOR. The new margin for the trade facility is to be 3/4 of a
percent, down from 1-1/4 percent. The package gives the creditor banks
an option--which is not likely to be exercised by most banks--of
receiving part of the interest payments in PINs (foreign-currency-
denominated, six-year, non-interest-bearing Philippine Investment
Notes) that can be used to make direct investments in the Philippines.

Following a speech by President Aquino criticizing the country's
foreign creditors, the new Philippine Congress, which convened for the
first time in 15 years on July 27, formed a special committee to
explore the possibility of repudiating part of the country's external
debt. In addition, the Senate passed a resolution ordering a review of
the commercial bank debt agreement.
In July, Colombia reached a preliminary agreement with a group of
banks to raise $1.06 billion in new money this year for disbursement in
1987-88. This amount nearly equals Colombia's amortization payments
due in this period to commercial banks. The electric power sector will
receive $200 million; the coal sector, $260 million; and the central
government $600 million for public investment. A tentative term sheet,
being circulated to Colombian creditors, contains a spread of 15/16
of a percentage point over LIBOR or 3/8 of a percentage point over the
lender's domestic banking interest rate and a maturity of 10-1/2 years
with a grace period of 5-1/2 years. These terms represent a longer
maturity and grace period and a lower spread over LIBOR by more than
1/2 of a percentage point than those in Colombia's 1985 loan. In
addition, the banks have not imposed conditions on the management of
the economy and have not required its performance to be monitored by
the IMF.
In June 1987, Bolivia's commercial bank creditors agreed to a
waiver of provisions in previous rescheduling agreements to allow
Bolivia to proceed with a plan to buy back up to $700 million of past
due principal at 10-15 cents on the dollar. Bolivia now has four
months to make its offer to buy back its debt to creditor banks, who
will respond individually; however, all banks selling their debt to the

IV-29
government will receive the same price. Bolivia's ambitious adjustment
program has decreased inflation to a 10-12 percent annual rate (from
almost 24,000 percent inflation in mid-1985) and led to positive growth
in 1987 to date after six consecutive annual decreases. The government
announced in July a new reactivation decree aimed at promoting external
trade and reforming the financial system. A letter of intent with the
IMF was signed in July 1987 for a three-year, SDR 133 million Extended
Fund Facility arrangement.
On July 28, Peru's President Garcia announced plans to
nationalize domestic banking and insurance firms, and shut down the
country's foreign exchange dealers. The moves followed a one-week bank
holiday and a weakening of the inti in the parallel foreign exchange
market. The firms facing nationalization are challenging the
constitutionality of the move in the courts, and legislation introduced
by the President in Congress implementing the nationalization plan has
become embroiled in controversy. In the interim, the government has
returned day-to-day control to the banks following an initial
intervention. Foreign banks were not included in the nationalization
plan. However, the status of foreign minority holdings in the private
banks remains unclear, and measures designed to control capital flight
could affect the operations of the foreign banks.
