DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Production and spending indicators suggest that growth in real GNP
will be greater in the third quarter than in the second. Labor demand
strengthened further in August: employment rose enough to hold the
jobless rate at 6.0 percent, and aggregate hours worked by production and
nonsupervisory workers expanded rapidly. Manufacturing activity has been
rising sharply since the spring, and the index of industrial production
apparently is posting its strongest quarterly gain in 3-1/2 years.
On the spending side, consumption outlays and business equipment
spending probably have risen sharply this quarter, but construction has
been soft. What information is available suggests that business inventory
accumulation has been moderate, owing, in part, to a runoff of auto
dealers' stocks; the fragmentary data on foreign trade suggest that the
trend of improvement in real net exports may be interrupted by a jump in
oil imports.
Price increases have eased in recent months after a sharp rise
earlier in the year and appear consistent with a third-quarter increase
in the fixed-weighted price index for GNP noticeably below the first-half
pace.
Employment and Unemployment
Nonfarm payroll employment advanced again in August; although the
gain was half the size of the July increase, the average change in the
two months approximated the pace of the first half of the year. The
average workweek also rose in August and, coupled with the overall employ-
ment gains, pushed up aggregate hours of production and nonsupervisory

workers 0.5 percent last month to a level 1 percent above the second-quarter
average.1
By industry, more than half the job growth during August took place
in the services industry, where hiring at business and health service
establishments continued quite strong. In contrast, employment fell
somewhat in retail trade, where job gains had averaged nearly 40,000 per
month over the first seven months of the year. In manufacturing, employ-
ment was about unchanged, on balance, after a sharp increase in July.
Jobs were up in machinery and printing, but down by small amounts in
food, textiles, and lumber and off sharply in apparel (where there had
been a jump reported in July).
Employment as measured by the household survey rose sharply in
August, continuing the strong upward trend evident so far this year.
However, growth in the labor force about matched the rise in employment
last month, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged. Most of the August
advance in both the labor force and employment occurred among teenagers,
although employment also rose for adult men and women.
Other indicators underscore the persistent strength in labor demand.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance moved down to about 300,000 per
week in the last three weeks of August-the lowest levels of the current
expansion. In addition, the Conference Board's help-wanted index rose in
July to its highest level since 1979, while both the August Michigan and
1. The staff anticipates that the workweek for September will be reduced
by 0.3 to 0.4 hour because Labor Day fell during the reference week for
the labor market survey. This Labor Day effect does not have implica-
tions for overall economic activity measured for the month as a whole.

II-4
Conference Board surveys of consumer sentiment suggest that respondents
view job availability as quite good.
Industrial Production
Industrial production increased 0.3 percent in August, after gains
of 0.8 percent in July and 0.7 percent in both June and May. Output of
consumer goods was up about one-quarter of a percent last month, as a
drop in auto assemblies, from an annual rate of 6.7 million units in July
to a 5.9 million rate in August, was more than offset by a further rise in
light truck production. Output of business equipment, which has increased
rapidly this year, rose further in August with increases in all major
components; significant gains so far this year have occurred in manufac-
turing and commercial equipment, apparently reflecting improvement in
both domestic and foreign demand.
Output of intermediate products--supplies for both construction
and business-was about unchanged in August, after several months of
solid gains. Materials output rose 0.2 percent last month; gains of
about 1 percent, on average, were recorded in the preceding two months.
Production of durable materials--in particular, equipment parts and
metals-increased in August, and nondurable materials output was up
fractionally to a level more than 7 percent higher than a year earlier.
Production of energy materials was unchanged during the month.
Overall, the August index of industrial production was 4-1/2 percent
higher than a year earlier. The August increase boosted the index 1.8
percent above its second-quarter average--a growth rate equal to more than
7 percent at an annual rate.

Capacity Utilization
Consistent with the strength in industrial production, capacity
utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities increased 0.1 percent
in August after rising 0.6 percent in July. The August utilization rate-
at 81.0 percent-was up 1-1/2 percentage points from April and the highest
since late 1984. Nonetheless, utilization for total industry remained a
bit below the 1967-86 average of 81.5 percent.
In manufacturing, the utilization rate rose 0.1 percent in August,
after a 0.5 percent increase in July. Gains in capacity use in manufac-
turing were widespread over those two months, with the largest increase in
primary metals, especially raw steel. At 77.8 percent of capacity, the
operating rate for primary metals is at its highest level since September
1981. These gains in the primary metal utilization rate, however, have
resulted primarily from cutbacks in capacity: output of primary metals in
August was still 13 percent below that in September 1981.
Producers of industrial materials operated at 80.7 percent of capa-
city in August, adding to the steady increases of recent months. Utili-
zation rates for durable goods materials and energy materials are still
far below earlier cyclical highs, but the rates for nondurable goods
materials such as pulp, paper, and textiles are high.
Personal Income and Consumption
Total personal income rose at about the same pace in July as in the
second quarter. Although wages and salaries grew somewhat less than their
average for the first half, stronger growth in hours worked in both July
and August and an increase in average hourly earnings for August suggest
that wages and salaries grew faster than reported initially. With the

temporary bulge in capital gains taxes largely completed by midyear, the
growth in nominal disposable income in July was larger than in the second
quarter. In real terms, disposable personal income probably rose somewhat
in July, but was only fractionally above the December level.
Personal consumption expenditures posted a strong increase in July,
with gains widespread across goods and services. In addition, nominal
retail sales increased 1.3 percent in August, bolstered by higher spending
for motor vehicles and gasoline; however, spending at the retail control
group of stores was up only 0.3 percent in August to a level about 1 percent
above the second-quarter average. To some extent the August figure may
reflect the lateness of Labor Day this year, with sales that normally
would have occurred in August being moved into September.
Total sales of autos and light trucks rose in August to a 17.7 million
unit annual rate from a 15.4 million unit rate in July, as manufacturers
offered an end-of-model-year round of price and financing incentives for
both cars and trucks. Although most of the additional sales were of
domestic models, automakers also offered the incentive plans on their
captive imports, increasing sales of these Japanese-produced cars as
well. Overall, however, the response of sales has not been as strong as
during the summer of 1986, when the incentives were somewhat more generous.
Indeed, the figures for domestic car sales in the first ten days of
September, indicating a drop to less than an 8 million unit rate, suggest
that the program may be losing its punch.

goods rose 3/4 percent in July to a level 2-1/2 percent above the second-
quarter average, led by the aircraft group and office and computing
equipment. In addition, near-term indicators of equipment spending have
been quite favorable recently.. New orders for nondefense capital goods rose
5.1 percent in July, powered by bookings for aircraft and parts. Aircraft
orders this year have outpaced shipments by a wide margin, and the backlog
of unfilled aircraft orders has been climbing rapidly. Excluding the
aircraft group, the July level of orders was 4-1/2 percent above the
second-quarter average, fueled by increased orders for office and computing
equipment.
Spending for nonresidential structures still appears to be trending
lower, but not nearly so fast as over the past couple of years. The
value of nonresidential construction put-in-place declined 1.1 percent in
July to a level 2.3 percent below the second-quarter average. Lower
industrial and other commercial construction accounted for all of the
July decline. However, some offsetting support is evident in petroleum
drilling, which rose sharply in July and August (petroleum drilling is
not included in the data on construction put-in-place). New commitments
for nonresidential construction have held fairly steady in recent months,
after a sustained downtrend over the past two years.
The Commerce Department's latest capital spending survey, taken in
July and August, indicates that business expects outlays for plant and
equipment to rise 2.5 percent in 1987. This is a smaller increase than
in the previous survey, which was taken in April and May, although antici-
pated spending in manufacturing industries for the remainder of 1987 rose
substantially. Most of the overall reduction reflects, arithmetically, a

II-13
shortfall in second-quarter outlays from what had been expected. The
latest survey continues to indicate an enormous spending gain in the
second half of 1987; however, the track record of this survey in
predicting second-half spending indicates that, though unbiased, its
forecast errors have been substantial.
Newly approved capital appropriations (net of cancellations) of the
nation's 1,000 largest manufacturers advanced 26.4 percent in the second
quarter, reaching the highest level since the first quarter of 1985. The
second-quarter increase was widespread. The backlog of unspent appropri-
ations-which has been a good indicator of the direction of manufacturers'
capital spending in the next quarter or two-turned up after two years of
decline.
Business Inventories
Inventories in mid-summer appeared to be under good control in most
segments of the nonfarm business sector. Although the current-cost value
of manufacturers' inventories rose in July at a rate faster than the
average pace seen in recent months, nearly half of the accumulation was
in stocks of aircraft and parts, where shipments and orders generally
have been quite strong. As a result of the apparently conservative
inventory stance in manufacturing, factory stocks are generally lean,
with the July inventory-shipments ratio near its lowest point in the
current cycle.
In the trade sector, current-cost inventories were little changed
in July. At the wholesale level, stocks of electrical goods, machinery,
and farm products were drawn down as sales advanced. For retailers other
than auto dealers, stocks rose at an annual rate of $5.8 billion, and the
inventory-sales ratio edged down.

II-15
At auto dealers, the quickened selling pace in August, in combination
with scaled-back production, is reducing stocks to more tolerable levels.
Relative to the average selling pace of the past year--7-3/4 million units-
inventories at the end of August had fallen to 62 days' supply from 71 days'
supply a month earlier. Automakers typically consider a 60 days' supply
to be the norm.
One of the significant question marks in the assessment of GNP growth
in the current quarter is the measurement of oil stocks. The evidence on
imports suggests that there should be a large inflow of oil into the country-
more than could be taken up in current use. Unfortunately, oil inventories
have a way of escaping the normal reporting channels, and there is a risk
that the national income accounts will not record a full offset to the
rise in imports, causing an unders atement of actual GNP growth. The
staff forecast has made an allowance for the typical understatement of
stocks in the short run.
Housing Markets
Prior to the most recent jump in interest rates, housing activity had
steadied. Total private housing starts in July, at a 1.61 million unit
annual rate, were about unchanged from the second-quarter average. In the
single-family sector, the adjustment resulting from the April-May spike in
mortgage interest rates apparently was completed by early summer, and
single-family housing starts rose in July to an annual rate of 1.16 million
units. The number of new homes sold was little changed over the three
months ending in July; in the existing home market, sales fell sharply in
June but then leveled off in July. Although conventional fixed-rate

mortgage interest rates fell slightly in July, they remained approximately
1-1/4 percentage points above their March low; and in the past couple of
weeks loan rates have soared, moving above the spring highs.
Multifamily housing starts in July-at an annual rate of 450,000
units--were toward the lower end of the range in which they have been
fluctuating in recent months. The weakness in this sector continues to
reflect both tax law changes that reduced the rate of return on multifamily
rental investment and a substantial excess supply of units in particular
regions. The recent rise in interest rates will reinforce these negative
factors, which already had caused widespread pessimism among builders
about the outlook for apartment construction.
Incoming data on house prices continue to show big year-to-year
gains in series that do not adjust for changes in quality and regional
mix but only small increases in the data for which such adjustments are
made. For example, the median price of new homes, a series that is not
adjusted for these influences, advanced 13.7 percent during the year
ended in July; in contrast, the constant-quality new home price index,
which also adjusts for the regional mix of sales, rose only 2 percent
during the year ended in June.
Government
The mid-year budget updates of the administration and the Congres-
sional Budget Office both showed downward revisions in their respective
estimates of the FY1987 federal budget deficit--to about $158 billion from
around $175 billion in the January estimates. Most of the revisions are
attributable to higher-than-anticipated revenues from tax reform. By con-
trast, deficit projections for FY1988 through FY1992 were revised up. For

II-19
both the administration and CBO, outlay estimates were raised to reflect
the effects of higher assumed inflation and interest rates and higher
spending levels enacted in this year's supplemental appropriation bill.
The CBO estimate also assumed that slower nominal income growth would
damp receipts, while in the administration reestimates, slower real
growth is largely offset by higher inflation.
Despite the similarity of the CBO and administration numbers for
fiscal 1987, the current year deficit estimates remain subject to con-
siderable uncertainty for several reasons. First, a "safe harbor"
regulation allowed corporations to base estimated tax payments due through
June 30 on last year's income levels. Both the administration and CBO
revenue estimates assume that there will be a sizable catch-up from the safe
harbor in tax payments due after June 30. The magnitude of these payments
should become apparent in September when most corporations make their
third quarterly estimated tax payment.
Second, the receipts expected from estimated tax payments of indivi-
duals for the third quarter also are uncertain. In particular, there is
little evidence on how the base-broadening provisions of tax reform have
affected these collections. Nor is there information on how capital
gains realizations (which are a major source of nonwithheld tax payments
and may be especially large given the recent strong performance of the
stock market) will be affected by repeal of the preferential tax rate for
long-term capital gains. The July monthly Treasury data and preliminary
daily data from August do indicate some pickup in nonwithheld individual
income taxes compared with last year, but the increase does not appear to
be unusually large. Most third-quarter estimated tax payments will not
be received by the Treasury until after September 15, however.

II-20
On the outlay side, a major source of uncertainty is the extent to
which planned asset sales (which are counted as negative outlays in the
budget) will be completed before the end of the fiscal year. On September 2
the Treasury received $1 billion for a package of Rural Development Fund
loan assets in its first major sale of loan assets in FY1987. Another
$1.7 billion of assets may be offered before the end of the fiscal year.
The administration and CBO also released, on August 20, the "snapshot"
deficit estimate for FY1988 that is required by the Gramm-Rudman Balanced
Budget Act. This snapshot estimate of the deficit (an average of separate
CBO and OMB estimates) was $153.4 billion1, indicating that uniform outlay
cuts of $45.4 billion would be needed to reach the FY1988 Gramm-Rudman
target of $108 billion. A congressional vote on such cuts, though required
by the Act, is not likely because amendments to the Gramm-Rudman Act that
would drastically alter FY1988 sequester requirements are currently before
a conference committee.
In addition to Gramm-Rudman fixes Congress will have to extend the
debt ceiling which expires September 23, and pass all of the required
FY1988 budget legislation-the 13 regular appropriation bills and a
reconciliation bill that makes changes in entitlement-driven spending
programs and taxes.
GNP data received in the period since the last Greenbook showed a
sharp upward revision in real federal purchases for the second quarter.
1. The "snapshot" estimate differs from the baseline or current services
estimates primarily because programs for which no 1988 appropriations
have been enacted are projected at the enacted 1987 level without inflation
adjustment in the "snapshot" and with inflation adjustment in the baseline
or current services estimates.

II-21
Greater staffing at the IRS and Justice agencies was authorized in recent
tax, immigration, and justice reform legislation; spending has picked up
accordingly. Spending related to the NASA space shuttle program also was
revised up.
So far in the third quarter, indicators of growth in real purchases
of goods and services by state and local governments have been mixed.
Employment grew 35,000 in August after remaining flat for three consecutive
months. In contrast, real spending on construction edged down in July,
following a 7.5 percent decline, at an annual rate, in the second quarter.
Prices
Price increases have eased in recent months, after a sharp rise
earlier in the year. Both the CPI and the PPI for finished goods were up
0.2 percent in July, and the latter was unchanged in August.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.3 percent in July.
Nonenergy service prices were up 0.4 percent, more than in May or June but
about the average rate over the past 12 months. After leveling off in
June, the CPI for commodities excluding food and energy rose 0.3 percent
in July; on balance, prices in this grouping have picked up notably so
far this year for apparel as well as for some other commodity categories
affected by rising import prices.
At the producer level, prices of (domestic) finished consumer goods,
excluding food and energy items, rose 0.3 percent in both July and August.
This index had edged down in the second quarter, after some large increases
earlier in the year. Capital equipment prices advanced 0.2 percent in
August, similar to their average pace for more than three years. In
both of these categories a drop in the index for new cars-reflecting

enhanced incentive programs--provided an offset to a pickup in the prices
of other items. If car prices had remained flat last month, the index for
consumer goods other than food and energy would have risen more than
1/2 percent.
Producer prices of intermediate materials (less food and energy)
rose another 0.3 percent in August-after advances of 0.5 percent in June
and July--with further notable increases for nonferrous metals, lumber,
plywood, and paperboard. However, prices dropped back for industrial
chemicals and plastic resins and materials. Prices of crude nonfood
materials less energy-one of the broader measures of industrial commodity
prices--were up 1 percent in August, less than the very rapid pace of the
May to July period.
Food. Consumer food prices turned down in July, owing mainly to a
reversal of the springtime runup in fruit and vegetable prices. In
addition, the price index for meats, poultry, fish and eggs rose 0.3
percent, after significantly larger increases in the second quarter.
The prices of other foods were up slightly, on balance, similar to the
experience during the first half of the year. In addition, with the
producer prices of finished foods down sharply in August, the near-term
outlook for retail food prices looks favorable.
There also seems to be little chance of a serious runup in food
prices over the longer term. Supplies of most food commodities remain
abundant, with stocks of field crops still at high levels, an expansion
in pork and poultry production apparently on track, and harvests of a
number of fruit crops up substantially from last year. The one question
mark is that beef production appears likely to trend lower over the next

couple of years. Although the number of cattle currently in feedlots is
up from a year ago, the pool of animals available for future placement
into feedlots has dwindled, owing to herd reductions of the past few
years. Consequently, the prices of these "feeder cattle" have been bid
up sharply, with spot prices in mid-September more than 25 percent above
a year ago.
Energy. Consumer energy prices also eased in July, reflecting a
3 percent drop in natural gas prices that resulted from lower utility
rates in some states and a one-time refund to gas customers in Michigan.
In contrast to natural gas, the prices of gasoline and fuel oil each rose
more than 1 percent in July, owing to the passthrough of higher crude oil
prices, while electricity prices were about flat.
The spot prices for crude oil and petroleum products remained
highly volatile into mid-September, owing to upside pressures associated
with tensions in the Middle East, and downside pressures stemming from
OPEC production that is well in excess of quota. According to industry
sources, OPEC production of crude oil was between 19 and 20 mb/d in
August, as compared to their second-half quota of 16.6 mb/d.
Posted prices for West Texas Intermediate have been more stable
than spot prices in recent months (chart). Posted prices represent
longer-term contracts (typically three to six months), which are the
primary means of transaction in the oil market. While posted prices
rose in response to Middle East uncertainties in July and August, the
rise was much more muted than in spot markets. Posted prices in early
September dropped back to their late-July level, probably reflecting the
build-up of inventories and the high level of OPEC production.

II-26
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage data available for the third quarter still are quite limited.
The hourly earnings index for production and nonsupervisory workers rose
0.4 percent last month to a level about 2-1/2 percent above a year earlier.
By industry, the largest increases in recent months have been in service-
producing industries where employment gains have been the greatest. In
contrast, wages for construction workers fell in both July and August
while manufacturing pay raises have remained quite small.
Data from the Bureau of National Affairs, which presents wage adjust-
ments negotiated in collective bargaining agreements covering 50 or more
workers, indicate that union wage gains, in particular, have been re-
strained this year. The median first-year wage increase negotiated
during the first 34 weeks of 1987 was just 2 percent, compared with an
average 3 percent initial pay hike in 1986. However, factoring lump sum
bonuses into the pay gains boosts the first-year average increase to
3 percent so far this year. Lump sum payments appear to be most important
in manufacturing, where their inclusion increases the average first-year
settlement from 1.3 percent to 3.0 percent. In contrast, average wage
increases in construction and other nonmanufacturing industries are
not altered much by the inclusion of lump sums.
Elsewhere in the union sector, contract talks for two of the largest
agreements up for renegotiation this year-those between the UAW and Ford
and GM-are currently under way. Earlier this month, the UAW chose Ford
as the target company for negotiations after receiving initial proposals
from both automakers. Preliminary indications suggest that any wage
increases negotiated in the new Ford contract are likely to be relatively

small in return for some agreements on job security. GM may resist
agreeing to job security provisions as strong as those likely to be
negotiated between Ford and the UAW without additional concessions on wages
in its parts plants because GM produces more of its parts internally than
does Ford.
Finally, revised data on productivity and costs in the nonfarm
sector were little different from the preliminary data reported earlier.
Nonfarm productivity is estimated to have risen 1.3 percent at an annual
rate in the second quarter while compensation per hour was up 3 percent at
an annual rate. In manufacturing, second-quarter productivity growth was
revised up sharply, reflecting stronger industrial production data than
previously reported. With first-quarter productivity also revised up,
output per hour in manufacturing now is estimated to have risen 4-1/4
percent at an annual rate over the first half of this year, compared with a
3 percent increase in 1986.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Market interest rates have moved up substantially since the last FOMC
meeting. During the early part of the intermeeting period, long-term rates
rose as adverse trade data led to downward pressure on the dollar and
accompanying concerns over inflation and foreign investors' willingness to
hold dollar-denominated assets. Most short-term rates also began to rise,
partly in anticipation of a possible tightening action by the Fed.
On September 4, the discount rate was raised 1/2 percentage point.
Commercial banks-which had been experiencing rising funding costs for some
time-seized the opportunity to announce an increase in the prime lending
rate from 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 percent. Since the discount rate increase, most
Treasury bill rates have increased about 15 basis points further while most
private short-term rates are up 40 to 50 basis points. Long-term Treasury
rates, which had increased about 50 basis points prior to September 4, also
are up about 15 basis points, on balance, since then.
Like the bond market, the stock market has been volatile of late.
The major stock price indexes established new records in late August but
have since dropped 3 to 6 percent below those all-time highs.
Growth of the monetary aggregates picked up in August. However,
with growth at annual rates of 6 and 7-1/2 percent respectively, M2 and M3
made up only small parts of their shortfalls from the annual target cones.
From the fourth quarter of 1986 through August, M2 expansion averaged only
about 4 percent and M3 growth 5 percent. M1 increased moderately last
month and has grown at a 6-3/4 percent rate since the fourth quarter.
Debt, like money, has been on a distinctly less rapid growth path
this year than last. Even assuming no debt ceiling-related disruption

later this month, the federal government's borrowing will rise less than
seasonally from the pace of the spring, when the Treasury's cash balance
was sharply increased. State and local debt issuance has been damped
recently by higher interest rates, which have been an especially strong
deterrent to advance refunding operations. Net borrowing by nonfinancial
businesses also appears to have eased this summer; with a relatively small
gap between aggregate capital expenditures and internal funds, share
retirements associated with mergers and other restructurings have remained
the major force behind business debt expansion. The available data on
household borrowing suggest some slowing in mortgage credit growth, but
consumer installment debt appears likely to record its strongest quarterly
gain in a year.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Ml expanded at a 5 percent annual rate in August after declining in
June and rising only marginally in July. The pickup last month reflected
a cessation of runoffs of demand deposits and an acceleration in other
checkable deposits to better than a 9 percent rate. Against the backdrop
of an uptrend in market interest rates, M1 velocity appears likely this
quarter to post its first increase since the fourth quarter of 1984.
M2 growth was bolstered last month by inflows to money market mutual
funds and by a sharp increase in overnight RP liabilities at commercial
banks; the latter development apparently was associated with a surge in
trading account acquisitions of Treasury securities. Among the retail
deposit components, a relatively steep offering rate curve continued
to induce strong inflows to small time deposits, while the more liquid
savings deposits and MMDAs were about flat in August after running off in

July. Small time account growth again was strongest in the Boston, New
York and Dallas districts where the interest rates offered remained
unusually attractive.
M3 accelerated in August as net issuance of wholesale managed lia-
bilities picked up with a strengthening of bank credit. Banks appeared to
be fairly aggressive in raising funds abroad to meet domestic credit needs;
issuance of Eurodollar deposits was up sharply along with borrowing from
foreign offices. Domestic large time deposits at banks, however, ran off
for the second consecutive month, after four months of strong increases.
At thrift institutions, by contrast, large time deposits grew at a 14-1/4
percent rate, apparently reflecting in part a substitution for.FHLB advances.
Thrifts also may have relied more heavily on large time deposits to fund
their increased volume of ARM loans, which are more difficult to securitize
and finance with RPs; after rising at a hefty pace over the last year, term
RPs at thrifts have contracted in recent months, by a substantial amount in
August.
Bank credit increased at almost an 11 percent annual rate in August,
well above the pace of earlier months. Net acquisitions of securities
strengthened noticeably as banks absorbed a large volume of Treasuries
during the congested auction schedule early in August after Congress raised
the debt ceiling. Bank loans accelerated to a 9 percent clip in August.
Business loans were flat, after declining in July, although loans at foreign
branches continued to surge; this pattern may reflect a somewhat wider spread
of the prime rate over LIBOR than early in the summer as LIBOR-based loans
tend to be booked offshore. Real estate lending remained strong last month,
exceeding the July pace, and consumer loans posted the most rapid increase
in over a year.

Corporate Finance
Borrowing by nonfinancial corporations appears to have slowed somewhat
in the past two months from the pace earlier in the year. The sum of
business loans at banks and commercial paper outstanding was down, on
balance, in July and August. The increase in interest rates also has led
some firms to defer long-term borrowing.
Domestic public offerings of bonds by industrial firms in August were
the lowest in two years and were concentrated in short- and intermediate-term
maturities; less than 15 percent had maturities of 20 years or more. In
the first half of 1987, when the bond market was more receptive, more than
half of such offerings carried maturities of at least 20 years, but more
recently the share has trended down gradually. Eurobond sales, which
typically are of shorter maturity, picked up last month, supported by
good investor demand for bonds with convertible features. As has been true
throughout this year, financial issues accounted for the greater share of
gross bond offerings, owing largely to the heavy supply of mortgage-backed
securities issued by investment banks and other private firms.
Low-rated bond offerings, which were unusually heavy in July, fell in
August when some large merger-related issues were postponed or cancelled.
With supply light and demand good for those issues that did come to market,
the Salomon Brothers low-rated bond index stood just 340 basis points over
Treasuries in early September, down from a spread of more than 500 basis
points early in the year. Supply factors also contributed to a recent
slight narrowing of spreads between higher-rated corporate debt and
Treasuries. Risk premiums thus have remained relatively low even though
the exposure of nonfinancial firms to rising interest rates is substantial.

Net interest payments absorbed a hefty 30 percent of the earnings of
nonfinancial corporations before interest and taxes in the first half of
this year, and recent increases in interest rates likely will move this
ratio higher.
Share prices reached their highest point ever in late August. At
the peak, the S&P 500 price-earnings index (based on reported profits of
the previous four quarters) stood at 23.3, slightly above the values of
the mid-1960s and the highest multiple since the early 1920s and 1930s.
Even with the apparent low cost of equity financing, gross offerings by
nonfinancial firms totaled only $1.4 billion in August, well below the
$3 billion average pace in the first half. Issuance by financial firms
was larger, buoyed by offerings of preferred stock by thrifts and several
large closed-end mutual fund issues. Sales of such mutual fund shares
have totaled more than $6.5 billion this year.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The Board staff is projecting a federal budget deficit of $40 billion
in the current quarter. Barring an interruption of normal borrowing
patterns by a failure of Congress to act on the federal debt ceiling that
expires on September 23, debt issuance by the Treasury should exceed the
size of the deficit, leaving a massive cash balance at the end of the
month. In the fourth quarter, the federal deficit is projected by the
staff to total about $75 billion, a substantial part of which would be
financed by drawing down the Treasury's cash balance. Third-quarter net
marketable borrowing has been entirely in the form of coupon issues, and
essentially no net bill issuance is expected in coming months. Although
the Treasury's financing pattern may have been a factor, the possibility

of temporary bill paydowns resulting from debt ceiling constraints also
likely has contributed to the continued wide spread between bill rates and
private short-term yields.
The first of several proposed loan sales by federal agencies reached
the market during the first week of September. In this transaction, the
Farmers Home Administration sold a pool of rural development loans to a
trust which issued a combination of senior and subordinated pay-through
bonds secured by the loans. The bonds are not government guaranteed but
because all principal and interest payments received are passed through
first to the senior bonds-leaving most of the default risk with the
subordinated issues--the senior bonds received a AAA rating. The senior
issues sold for $1.1 billion and offered yields ranging from 8.77 to 10.25
percent on five maturity classes. To date, it is not clear whether the
subordinated securities will be offered to the public or placed privately.
If they cannot be sold, the subordinated debt will be held by the Farmers
Home Administration; even if this were to be the case, the proceeds of the
senior issue apparently would still be treated as a loan sale and not a
borrowing.
Borrowing by the federally sponsored agencies is projected to slow
somewhat during the third quarter from its second-quarter pace. Debt
issuance by Federal Home Loan Banks will show a sizable drop as a result
of a slowdown in their advances to member thrifts. After paying down debt
during the first half of 1987, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be
modest net borrowers during the third quarter owing to a significant slowing
in mortgage prepayments.

in July and August after the Farm Credit System's announcement of a smaller-
than-expected loss in the second quarter. The spread on 3-month securities
narrowed from 95 basis points at the time of the auction in July to 53
basis points in August.
The newly created Financing Corporation (FICO), which has been
established to provide financial assistance to the FSLIC, is included
in the total for sponsored agencies for the first time. FICO has indicated
that it will market at least one, and possibly two, bond issues of $400 to
$600 million by year-end, the principal of which will be backed by holdings
of zero-coupon Treasury issues; interest will be paid out of future insurance
premiums and a reserve fund. The first of these issues will reach the market
in late September but will not be settled until October. This issue will
have a maturity of 30 years, and market participants expect it to yield
between 75 and 100 basis points over 30-year Treasuries.
Municipal Securities Markets
The volume of new tax-exempt bonds eased to $6 billion in August, and
is expected to be light again in September. Offerings of bonds for new
capital held up last month, but issuance of refunding bonds continued to
wane. Reduced supplies helped to stabilize municipal bond yields during
August while taxable bond yields were rising, and the ratio of tax-exempt
to taxable rates reached its lowest level in some time. But, with the
further rise in interest rates in early September, the ratio backed up as

I-14
the tax-exempt market reportedly was burdened with selling pressure from
dealers, institutional investors, and bond funds (see chart on page III-12).
Gross issuance has continued strong in short-term municipal markets.
As in recent months, the short-term market was dominated by tax and revenue
anticipation notes in August as governments refinanced maturing cash manage-
ment notes. Of the $2.2 billion August volume, $1.3 billion came from an
offering by Texas to enable that state to deal with its current budget
crisis. This is only the second time Texas has sold securities for cash
flow purposes; the recent issue follows a $600 million offering last November.
Issuance of taxable municipal securities has been low this year, but
likely will be boosted in September when Orange County, California, sells $600
million in commercial paper and notes. The stated purpose of the offering
is to earn arbitrage profits, expected to be at least $1.3 million in a
12-month period. Proceeds of the commercial paper issue, $400 million, will
be reinvested in a variety of instruments, including term RPs and bank CDs.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages have increased significantly
since the last FOMC meeting. As of last week, the average contract rate
on new commitments for 30-year fixed-rate conventional home mortgages had
risen almost 60 basis points, and prevailing secondary market yields point
to some further increase in this rate. Meanwhile, on September 8, the
Veterans Administration raised the maximum allowable contract rate on
VA-guaranteed, fixed-rate home loans by 50 basis points to 10.50 percent.
By contrast, the average initial rate quoted on one-year adjustable-
rate mortgages, which are indexed to the one-year constant maturity Treasury
yield, has increased only 20 basis points during the intermeeting period.

III-15
In fact, this is little changed from the level in early July, though over
the same interval yields on secondary mortgage market ARM instruments have
jumped about 100 basis points and the one-year Treasury rate has risen even
more. These data on ARM pricing, as well as recent trade reports, suggest
that lenders have been offering larger initial rate discounts on adjustable-
rate products in attempts to gain shares of the burgeoning ARM market.
Half of all conventional home purchase mortgages closed in July and August
carried adjustable rates, and more than half of ARMs closed in July possessed
first-year "teaser" rates.

The rise in fixed-rate mortgage rates has further slowed refinancings
and has damped mortgage volume at almost all lenders. However, different
lender groups have been affected in varying degrees. Buoyed by the recent
ARM popularity, mortgage originations at FSLIC-insured thrifts totaled

$21.6 billion in July, only 3 percent below the average during the first
half of the year. In contrast, mortgage bankers-who tend to specialize
in FHA/VA lending, almost all of which is fixed-rate-appear to have
suffered much reduced origination volumes as the demand for fixed-rate
mortgages has eased. With their traditional sources of business in a
slump, mortgage bankers have turned to the conventional ARM market. How-
ever, intense price competition from thrifts and lack of a well-developed
secondary market for ARMs have hindered their ability to profitably
originate and sell adjustable-rate loans. According to trade reports,
many mortgage companies have trimmed staffs in response to reduced lending
volumes.
Reflecting the drop in fixed-rate lending activity, mortgage pass-
through security issuance apparently declined in August for the fourth
consecutive month, though volume normally picks up during the summer.
Despite the increased ARM share of loan closings, ARM-backed securities
issued in July totaled a relatively meager $1.4 billion.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding rose at a 7 percent annual
rate in July. Combined with an upward-revised 9-1/2 percent increase in
June, the July gain established the strongest two-month period of growth
since September-October of last year when financing incentives were boosting
auto sales and borrowing.
The stepped-up use of installment credit is consistent with the
strength in retail sales in June and July, which was particularly evident
in the durable goods component that relies more heavily on such financing.
The rebound in consumer credit also may reflect a cooling of the torrid

pace of home equity borrowing. Data collected from commercial banks indicate
some slowing of revolving home equity loans over the course of the summer.
These data are not seasonally adjusted and data on the other lenders are
sparse, but contacts at several institutions with major home equity programs
indicate that they have experienced a sharp falloff in new applications
since midyear.
Growth in auto credit was moderate in July (prior to announcement of
the latest round of financing incentives from the automakers), but revolving
credit jumped to an 11-1/2 percent increase, a figure topped only twice in
the past 15 months. This component of consumer credit has been held back
partly by homeowners drawing on lower-cost home equity lines to pay off
credit card balances. Thus, the pickup in revolving credit may indicate
that the backlog of card balances subject to being paid off in this manner
has by now been substantially worked down.1
Second-quarter data on debt payment difficulties showed little change
from the first quarter. Delinquency rates on closed-end consumer loans at
banks were up slightly, and were about at the midpoint of their historical
range. Auto loan delinquencies at the financing subsidiaries of the auto-
makers dropped a little, also staying at a moderate level. Despite a
decline, delinquencies on bank credit cards remained at a historically
high level. Mortgage loan delinquencies reported by the Mortgage Bankers
Association continued a gradual downtrend that began early last year, but
they were still fairly high by historical standards.
1. Based on household survey data, it was estimated that at the end of
1985 around one-fifth (or $25 billion) of outstanding credit card balances
were held by people who both typically revolved their credit card debts and
had sufficient equity in a home to obtain a home equity line of credit.
Since then, home equity line balances have increased perhaps $40 billion,
enough to eradicate much of the credit card balances vulnerable to refinancing,
as well as to accommodate a variety of other uses.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted, foreign-exchange value of the dollar has
declined about 1-3/4 percent since the last FOMC meeting on August 18
and more than 4 percent from its peak on August 11. Selling pressure
on the dollar, which intensified following the release on August 14 of
worse-than-expected data on U.S. merchandise trade in June, persisted
despite official intervention purchases of dollars by the Desk
Market participants inferred from the lack of
official comments from the United States concerning the dollar and from
the size of the intervention purchases that these transactions were
intended to smooth the dollar's decline, not to stop or reverse it.
The value of the dollar stabilized later in the period following the
half-point increase in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve and the
widening of short-term interest-rate differentials favoring the dollar.
The release of data showing a smaller-than-expected trade surplus for
Japan in August provided additional support for the dollar and seemed
to help offset the immediate negative reaction to the release of data
showing a larger-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in July.
While long-term interest rates in the United States rose sharply
during the intermeeting period, the yields on mark- and yen-denominated
assets also rose, but by less. The average yield on German bonds
increased during the period about 20 basis points to 6.14 percent.
This increase may be due in part to some concern about the future
reaction of the monetary authorities to the above-target rate of money
growth in Germany. The yield on the Japanese bellwether bond rose
about 25 basis points on net to 5.35 percent, after having fallen

sharply in the first half of the period to 4.16 percent as the yen
continued to strengthen against the dollar. The yield rose later in
the period partly in reaction to concerns about the vulnerability of
Japanese corporations following the revelation that a Japanese chemical
company had incurred heavy losses in bond futures trading.
The Desk purchased $169.75 million against yen and $50 million
against marks for the System account and $219.75 million against yen
for the Treasury account during the intermeeting period. Early in the
period the Desk also purchased $38.8 million equivalent of yen in
customer transactions with the World Bank to help replenish yen
balances in the System account.
To help reduce the selling pressure on
the lira, on September 14 the Italian government imposed a ceiling on
domestic credit growth and tightened foreign-exchange controls.

IV-4
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States declined
by $6 billion in July. (See line 4 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table.) There were substantial declines in
the holdings of members of OPEC, but the bulk of the decline was
accounted for by members of the G-10, only a fraction of which was
attributable to reported intervention sales of dollars. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) attributed much of the decline, which
was concentrated in holdings of Treasury bills, to the fact that
maturing holdings could not be rolled over because of Treasury debt-
ceiling problems and the postponement of the weekly auctions. Partial
information from the FRBNY indicates some increase in Treasury bill
holdings in August, after the auctions were resumed, but the increase
did not reverse the July decline.
Little information is available on how the G-10 monetary
authorities invested the dollars they shifted out of the United States
in July, but it is likely that the very large inflow reported by banks
between the end of June and the end of July (line 1) was related, at
least indirectly, to the availability of funds in the Euromarkets
resulting from foreign official investment decisions. In addition, the
pattern of bank flows is also likely to be related to the demand for
funds in the United States. The table on International Banking Data,
which presents data on a monthly average basis on U.S. banks' net
claims on their affiliated banking offices abroad and International
Banking Facilities (line 1), suggests that the inflows that occurred
towards the end of July did not reverse on average in August. These
inflows contributed to the financing of a sharp expansion in domestic
bank credit in August, substantially in excess of core deposit growth.

Private holdings of U.S. securities continued to increase in
July, although not at record rates. Foreign net purchases of U.S.
corporate bonds (line 2a on the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table) were $3 billion in July, up somewhat from the
second quarter pace. Based upon more recent information on new
Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations, net purchases of bonds are likely
to remain at about that level at least through August. Foreign net
purchases of U.S. corporate stocks (line 2b) were over $2 billion in
July, with about half the net purchases accounted for by Japanese
residents. U.S. residents increased their holdings of foreign stocks
and bonds (line 2c). However, they appear to have been net sellers of
Japanese stocks, while buying stocks in Canada and Europe. Foreign net
purchases of U.S. Treasury obligations (line 3) were small in July;
there were net sales by private residents of Japan and by the World
Bank, and net purchases by private residents of the rest of the world.
Data released recently by the Department of Commerce
(September 15) on other international transactions in the second
quarter of 1987 are shown on lines 6 through 10. Direct investment in
the United States (line 7) is running very strong in 1987 as the result
of a large number of mergers and acquisitions including, for example,
British Petroleum's takeover of Standard Oil. The direct investment
inflow resulting from these transactions depends on inflows into the
United States from the foreign parent company and, since financing
arrangements vary, the size and timing of these inflows need not match
exactly the size and timing of the underlying transactions. U.S.
direct investment abroad (line 6) was almost $6 billion in the second
quarter, down from the first quarter, which was inflated by the
inclusion of large unrealized currency translation gains in reinvested

IV-8
earnings. The statistical discrepancy in the accounts (line 10) was
large and positive in the second quarter, more than reversing the
outflow recorded in the first quarter.

IV-9
July Trade Data
As reported on September 11 by the Census Bureau, the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit for July, on a c.i.f. basis, was $198 billion
at an annual rate (not seasonally adjusted) -- the largest single
monthly deficit recorded so far this year. Correcting for seasonal
factors and translating the data to a balance of payments basis, the
staff estimates the July deficit to have been $165 billion at an annual
rate, which is about unchanged from the June deficit and only slightly
larger than the second-quarter average (see table).

only.
The value of seasonally unadjusted exports for July remained about
unchanged from June levels. When correcting for seasonal variation,
however, the value of exports rose about 7 percent in July. Increases
were recorded in agricultural exports (particularly soybeans and wheat)
and capital goods (almost entirely aircraft to Brazil and Japan), with
small decreases in exports of passenger cars to Canada.
The value of imports was somewhat higher in July relative to the
previous month, and was sharply higher than the second-quarter average,

basis. The increase in imports occurred almost entirely in crude oil
and petroleum products, as the volume of imported oil jumped 13 percent
and the average price rose about 40 cents per barrel.
Q2: Merchandise Trade
For the second quarter, the merchandise trade balance recorded a
deficit of $158 billion (annual rate) on a seasonally adjusted, balance
of payments basis. Overall growth in exports was somewhat more rapid
than growth in imports, but the second quarter deficit was nevertheless
slightly larger than in previous quarters (see table).

The value of exports rose roughly 6 percent over the revised first
quarter levels. Most of the recorded increases were in export volume
and were spread across agricultural products (primarily corn and
wheat), machinery (where increases were widespread) and industrial
supplies (particularly chemicals and paper products).
Import value increased almost 4 percent in the second quarter,
with most of the rise concentrated in imports of petroleum and

IV-11
products. The price of imported oil increased 11 percent or $1.70 per
barrel from the price in the first quarter, and the volume of oil
imports rose 4 percent. The value of non-oil imports increased 3
percent in the second quarter, with a small decline in imports of
industrial supplies (particularly metals) more than offset by rising
imports of capital goods, consumer goods, and automobiles (new cars
from Japan and Korea). The increase in imports of capital goods was
widespread across categories (electrical and nonelectrical machinery as
well as aircraft) while the rise in consumer goods was concentrated in
apparel and nondurable goods. Slightly more than one half of the pick-
up in value was due to a rise in the prices of imported products, with
the remainder due to increases in volume.
Q2: Current Account
The current account deficit continued to widen in the second
quarter, recording a deficit of $164 billion at an annual rate, about
$17 billion worse than the deficit for the first quarter. Declines in
receipts of capital gains on U.S. direct investment assets abroad
accounted for almost the entire increase in the current account
deficit, as the widening trade deficit contributed only $3 billion (see
table).

Developments in the Foreign Industrial Countries
The average pace of economic growth in the major foreign industrial
economies increased in the second quarter following a very weak first
quarter. Scattered evidence on the pace of economic activity since the
second quarter has been mixed. In Germany, real GNP grew by 4.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, reversing a first-quarter decline but
leaving GNP no higher than in the third quarter of last year. Real GDP
also resumed growing in the second quarter in France and Italy after
virtually no growth in the first quarter. Both Canada and the United
Kingdom showed continued strong growth of real GDP in the second
quarter. In Japan, indicators of second-quarter activity appear weak.
Although the level of inflation abroad has remained generally low,
consumer price inflation (measured on a year-over-year basis) has edged
higher in recent months in Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada,
and Italy. Trade and current account surpluses for the year to date
remain at or near record high levels in Japan and Germany, but data on
trade volumes indicate continued real adjustment of exports and imports
in both countries.
Individual country notes. In Japan, economic indicators for the
second quarter have been mixed, but on balance they suggest
significantly slower growth than in the first quarter. Preliminary data
for the third quarter suggest some rebound in growth. Industrial
production fell 0.2 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter as a whole, but
rose 4.3 percent in June and a further 1 percent in July. Capacity
utilization in the manufacturing sector declined in April and May, after

rising in the first quarter, and remained well below its peak level of
mid-1985. The unemployment rate fell from 3.2 percent (s.a.) in May to
2.7 percent in July.
The consumer and housing sectors have provided some signs of
strength. Retail sales rose 2.3 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter
but then declined 0.5 percent in July. For the first seven months of
1987, retail sales were 4.5 percent above their level in the comparable
period of 1986. After sluggish growth earlier in the year, new housing
starts rose 7.9 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter and 3.3 percent in
July. So far this year, housing starts are about 20 percent above their
year-earlier level.
Inflation remains low in Japan. The index of consumer prices rose
0.2 percent (n.s.a.) in August, to a level 0.8 percent above its August
1986 level, but the average for the first eight months of the year was
only 0.1 percent above the level for the first eight months of 1986.
The all-commodities index of wholesale prices rose in July and August
but was still 1.1 percent below its year-earlier level. Wholesale
prices have increased in recent months due to higher domestic prices of
oil products.
Japan's trade surplus in dollar terms increased (s.a.) in July but
then declined in August. For the first eight months of 1987, the
cumulative trade surplus was $82 billion (s.a.a.r.), the same rate as in
1986 as a whole. In the first eight months of 1987, export volume was
2.3 percent below its year-earlier level while import volume was 6
percent above its year-earlier level. The current account surplus

IV-18
narrowed further in July to $6.3 billion (s.a.). The cumulative current
account surplus for the first seven months of 1987 totaled $89 billion
(s.a.a.r.), slightly higher than in 1986.
Money growth has been rapid, with M2+CDs increasing 10.3 percent in
the 12 months through July. For the third quarter, the Bank of Japan
projects annual growth of M2+CDs of "around 10 percent." Bank of Japan
officials have recently stressed that, while there are no plans to
alter the relaxed stance of monetary policy in the near term, they are
carefully watching price developments. Concern over rapid price
increases for construction-related materials and for land in the Tokyo
area has been mentioned frequently.
Three tax reform measures have passed the lower house of the Diet
and are expected to be passed by the upper house later this month. The
bills provide a personal income tax cut of 1.54 trillion yen ($11
billion) for the current fiscal year (larger than the 1 trillion yen tax
cut promised in the recent demand stimulus package), elimination of
preferential tax treatment for postal savings accounts in FY1988, and an
increase in central government transfers to local governments to fund
public works projects.
In Germany, real GNP in the second quarter grew 4.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.) after falling at a 3.5 percent rate in the first quarter.
The level of real GNP reached in the second quarter was only 0.8 percent
above that in the second quarter of 1986 and not significantly higher
than in the second half of last year. The fluctuation in activity
between the first two quarters of this year was due in large part to

IV-19
unusually severe winter weather, which slowed construction in the first
quarter and led to a rebound of construction in the second quarter.
Private consumption also fluctuated sharply between the first two
quarters with growth rates of minus 3.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter and plus 12.7 percent in the second. This pattern was caused in
part by the timing of a special tax incentive program designed to
promote the purchase of autos with new pollution-control equipment.
Real exports rose at a rate of 10.3 percent in the second quarter, but
imports rose slightly faster, leaving the net foreign contribution
unchanged at its first-quarter level, which was significantly below last
year's average level.
Industrial production in July declined by 1.3 percent (s.a.) for the
second consecutive month. The July level was 4.1 percent below that of
July last year. Total manufacturing orders rose 0.9 percent (s.a.) in
July on the strength of foreign orders. The latter recovered their
year-ago level for the first time since late in 1985. Domestic orders,
on the other hand, remained 3 percent below their year-ago level. The
unemployment rate remained unchanged at 9 percent (s.a.) in August. The
most recent release of the business sentiment index showed some
continued improvement in July from the trough of early this year.
The consumer price index fell slightly in August to a level 0.8
percent above August of last year. Import prices began rising again in
March and have put some moderate upward pressure on consumer prices.
The current account surplus in July was $2.6 billion (n.s.a.)
bringing the cumulative total so far this year to $24 billion, compared

IV-20
to $18 billion for January through July of last year. The volume of
exports in the first half of this year was unchanged from one year ago,
while the volume of imports grew 3.4 percent.
In France, real GDP grew by 3.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second
quarter after having stagnated in the first quarter. For the first half
of the year, total domestic demand grew by 4.4 percent (s.a.a.r.),
boosted by strong investment, while net exports made a negative
contribution to growth.
In the United Kingdom, the output measure of real GDP rose by.3
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter and was 4 percent above its
year-earlier level, while unemployment declined (s.a.) for the
thirteenth consecutive month in July. The surge in imports in July,
which kept the current account in deficit for the third consecutive
month, reinforced concerns about domestic overheating that had prompted
the government to increase official lending rates by 1 percentage point
on August 6.
Canadian real growth in the second quarter also continued to be
robust. Real GNP rose by 6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter
following a similar rise in the first quarter. Already strong
consumption increased further in the second quarter, and investment
continued its strong pace. Net exports showed little change in either
quarter.
In Italy, the new government has introduced a number of temporary
tax increases designed to restrain the rate of growth of domestic
demand. A related objective of these taxes is to reduce the projected

IV-21
1987 budget deficit, which is currently expected to exceed last year's
deficit. The Bank of Italy raised its discount rate by 1/2 percentage
point to 12 percent on August 28, mainly in response to recent exchange
market pressure on the lira. On September 14, Italian authorities
tightened exchange controls and imposed a ceiling on bank lending.

IV-22
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Following a meeting with U.S. officials, Brazil's Finance
Minister Bresser Pereira stated that his earlier proposals to capture
part of the secondary market discount on Brazil's foreign debt to
commercial banks would not be unilaterally imposed on banks by Brazil.
In Argentina, the Radical Party of President Alfonsin lost its majority
in the Chamber of Deputies and several gubernatorial seats, including
the Buenos Aires governorship, in September 6 election. Mexico's plan
to increase subsidies to state enterprises puts in jeopardy the Mexican
commitment to the IMF to raise additional government revenues from
public sector price adjustments this year. The Venezuelan government
has decided to sign its revised, $20 billion public sector debt
restructuring agreement with commercial banks. In Peru, legislative
action on President Garcia's plan to nationalize private banks and
insurance companies is proceeding; key provisions of the bill remain to
be considered. In the Philippines, the Finance Minister and probably
the Central Bank Governor will be replaced in a cabinet shuffle
following the attempted coup of August 28-29.
Individual Country Notes. On September 8, Brazil's Finance
Minister Bresser Pereira met with U.S. officials about the Brazilian
debt situation. Following the meeting, Bresser Pereira stated that his
earlier proposals to exchange debt to commercial banks for bonds at a
rate reflecting part of the market discount on loans would be a
voluntary option and not be unilaterally imposed on banks by Brazil.
Brazil expects to make proposals to banks regarding rescheduling of its
debt on September 25.

IV-23
On September 9, the IMF Executive Board assessed Brazil's
economic policies. A positive IMF report is one condition set by the
Paris Club for rescheduling principal payments due the first half of
1987. The report from the IMF is unlikely to be unambiguously
positive; it is uncertain at this point what action the Paris Club will
take at its meeting scheduled for the week of September 21.
In August, the Brazilian authorities took further steps to raise
domestic interest rates and control government expenditures,
recognizing that without corrective action the government could not
hope to meet its goals of reducing the fiscal imbalance and containing
inflation. Inflation in August was 6.4 percent with price controls,
higher than the government had hoped. Price and wage controls are now
in the process of being dismantled. Preliminary estimates indicate
that the trade surplus in August again was over $1 billion.
In Argentina, the Radical Party of President Alfonsin lost its
majority in the Chamber of Deputies in the September 6 elections. The
government, which was already a minority in the upper house, retains a
plurality of seats in the Chamber. In addition, the Radical Party lost
five gubernatorial seats to the opposition Peronists, including the
Buenos Aires governorship to likely 1989 presidential candidate Antonio
Cafiero. Following the vote, the outcome of which was attributed in
the press to the poor performance of the economy, the entire cabinet
submitted its resignation. Several of the resignations have been
accepted, but President Alfonsin has announced that Economy Minister
Sourrouille would retain his job.
Consumer prices rose 13.8 percent in August, up from 10.1 percent
in July and the highest monthly inflation rate since the inception of

IV-24
the Austral plan in June 1985. Industrial production in the first
seven months of 1987 was 8 percent above the same period a year ago.
The Mexican government announced that it will increase subsidies
.to the state enterprises that have raised prices by less than the rate
of inflation, in order to avoid accelerated price increases by these
enterprises. This decision puts in jeopardy the Mexican commitment to
the IMF, under the stand-by arrangement, to generate 0.5 percent of GDP
in additional revenues from public sector price adjustments this year.
As the campaign for the 1988 presidential election gets under way,
increases in public expenditures beyond originally planned levels may
be expected. While petroleum revenues have been exceeding expectations
as world oil prices have strengthened, other revenues were running
below expectations in the first half of 1987, mainly because of the
continuing depressed levels of economic activity.
The effective annual yield of 91-day Treasury bills at the
September 8 auction was 135 percent, compared with 150 percent in early
March when rates began to decline. In contrast, the annualized
inflation rate in June-August was 147 percent, so that, ex-post, the
bill yield was negative in real terms, as has been the case since May.
The monthly rate of crawl of the peso price of the dollar in the
controlled market averaged 5 percent in July and August, more than 3
percentage points less than the monthly inflation rate. Since last
November, the peso has appreciated against the dollar in real terms by
about 8 percent, taking account of U.S. inflation. In the first half
of 1987, the current account was in surplus by $3.1 billion, compared
with a deficit of $1.1 billion in the same period in 1986.

IV-25
On September 7, the Venezuelan government announced that it would
sign its revised $20 billion public sector debt rescheduling agreement
with commercial banks. Finance Minister Azpurua stated that the
agreement would be signed on September 18, meeting the end of September
deadline to allow reduction in the spread, from 1-1/8 percentage points
to 7/8 of a percentage point over LIBOR, retroactive to April 1987.
Government officials had previously suggested that signature would
require "assurances" from its bank creditors of new money. Venezuela
is now attempting to assemble about $2 billion in new finance from bond
issues, increased trade credits, and additional project-related finance
from commercial banks. The government also continues to discuss with
the World Bank the possibility of World Bank policy-based lending,
focusing on trade liberalization.
In Peru, legislation nationalizing private banks and insurance
companies has cleared the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) and is now
in the Senate. Key provisions of the bill remain to be considered,
along with amendments that would exempt some domestic firms from
nationalization or require, in special circumstances, less than 100
percent government ownership. Some version of the bill is expected to
be passed by end-September, and the Chamber of Deputies will then vote
on whether to accept the Senate version. Industry and Commerce
Minister Romero, an important moderate in the cabinet, resigned his
post in opposition to the nationalization. However, President Garcia
will not accept the resignation until a suitable successor is found.
The government also announced in August that terms had been
completed on "payment-in-kind" agreements with two banks, First
Interstate of California and Midland Bank, whereby the banks will

IV-26
accept goods in lieu of overdue debt payments. A government spokesman
also indicated that payments to eliminate arrears to the World Bank
might be forthcoming, but no date was specified.
In early-September, the Philippines cabinet resigned in the wake
of political turmoil following the attemptedcoup of August 28-29. The
resignation of Finance Minister Ongpin subsequently was accepted, and
unconfirmed reports indicate that Central Bank President Fernandez will
also be replaced. These cabinet changes may well reflect discontent
with the government's handling of the economy and the debt issue.
