DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Production and employment continued to expand strongly in the
fourth quarter. In particular, manufacturing output recorded another
sizable gain, bolstered by the continued upswing in exports. However,
domestic final sales were weak as consumption outlays and business fixed
investment declined, and much of the production gain apparently went
into inventories. This buildup in stocks may portend a near-term
deceleration in activity, and initial claims for unemployment insurance
have registered a noteworthy rise. Wages have shown little
acceleration, despite the decline in the unemployment rate, and price
inflation has moderated recently as energy prices have declined.
Fourth-quarter GNP
According to the Commerce Department's preliminary estimates, real
GNP rose at a 4-1/4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1987.1
Arithmetically, business inventory accumulation more than accounted for
the growth in output, as final sales (excluding accumulations at the
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)) are estimated to have fallen 1-1/2
percent at an annual rate. Consumption spending declined substantially.
More than half of the drop resulted from lower automobile purchases;
however, outlays for nondurables also fell, and spending for services
slowed from its earlier pace. In addition, business fixed investment
dropped back somewhat, after a third-quarter surge. Exports meanwhile
1. In deriving its preliminary fourth-quarter estimates, the Commerce
Department did not have the December data for some key series-notably
inventories, merchandise trade, shipments of nondefense capital goods,
and construction put-in-place.
II-1

II-2
continued to soar at a double-digit rate, and net exports increased
enough to account for about a percentage point of fourth-quarter GNP
growth.
The national income and product accounts show agricultural stocks
(measured as the sum of farm inventories and CCC stocks) continuing to
rise very rapidly in the fourth quarter and over 1987 as a whole.
However, the reported accumulation is largely a statistical artifact
that is inconsistent with physical stocks data and also somewhat at odds
with the fairly sharp price rebound that has occurred for many crops
this past year. In reality, as is indicated in more detail in a later
section, real agricultural inventories probably fell last year.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in November and 0.2 percent
in December, after even larger gains in the summer and early fall. The
small advance in December occurred as continued strength in output of
materials and intermediate products was offset somewhat by declines for
business equipment and automotive products. Chemicals and paper have
bolstered materials production in recent months, which reflects, in
part, the improved trade situation. Output of basic metals also is
benefitting from the decline in the dollar, with the most recent
strength occurring in nonferrous metals, particularly copper. The
fairly widespread decline in the production of business equipment in
December followed a surge in October and a flat November. The recent
weakness in this category has been most pronounced in the computer
industry.

II-4
Early indications of industrial activity in January are mixed: auto
schedules called for about a 10 percent reduction in assemblies and oil
drilling is down somewhat. However, production of both steel and trucks
is up, and preliminary data on electricity generation show a sizable
gain--beyond the normal seasonal increase for January. A separate
signal of industrial activity was given by the January Purchasing
Manager's survey; more respondents reported increases than decreases,
but the margin was smaller than in December.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities edged
up 0.1 percentage point in December to 82.1 percent. For the fourth
quarter, the average operating rate was 82 percent--its highest
quarterly value since early 1980. Operating rates at manufacturers were
little changed in December, after substantial increases earlier last
year, especially in primary processing industries. The utilization rate
for iron and steel was 91 percent in November 1987, compared with 65
percent in December 1986. Likewise, nonferrous metals industries were
operating at nearly 90 percent of capacity at year-end, more than 10
percentage points higher than at the end of 1986. These high rates
reflect not only sharp increases in output during the past year, but
also permanent closings of many mills during the 1980s. Operating rates
in most manufacturing industries now have moved above their 1967-86
average. Nevertheless, utilization rates in some industries, such as
machinery and electrical equipment, remain below their longer-run
averages.

II-6
Capacity utilization at producers of industrial materials, most of
which are in the manufacturing sector, rose 0.2 percentage point in
December to 82.8 percent. Gains came at producers of both durable and
nondurable goods materials, while operating rates at energy materials
industries eased somewhat. Materials industries, many of which also are
included in the manufacturing primary processing grouping, have shown a
broad-based rise in utilization in the past year. Utilization for
textile, paper, and chemical materials reached 91.5 percent of capacity
in December, 4.5 percentage points above its level a year earlier.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor demand remained strong through December, as employment
registered further large gains and the unemployment rate continued to
edge lower. Nonfarm payroll employment rose more than 300,000 in
December, bringing the total of new jobs added in the fourth quarter to
more than 1.1 million. Manufacturing employment was up for the sixth
consecutive month and has increased close to 400,000 since June. While
this growth has been widespread across both durable and nondurable goods
industries, the largest gains have been in the trade-sensitive
industries, such as electrical and nonelectrical machinery. Among the
major manufacturing industries, only transportation equipment--motor
vehicles, in particular--has shown sustained weakness. Construction
posted strong gains over the past three months, broadly consistent with
rising construction expenditures in the fourth quarter.
Employment in the services industry remained robust at year-end,
led by growth in business and health services. In contrast, employment

II-7
in retail trade fell slightly in December, with weakness concentrated in
the general merchandise area. Finance, insurance, and real estate
employment was flat in December; gains in these industries had been
small since spring, after several years of rapid expansion.
Although the average workweek was down two-tenths of an hour in
December, work schedules, especially in factories, continue to be very
high by historical standards. Aggregate hours of production and
nonsupervisory workers grew at a 3-1/4 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, after adjusting for the distorting effects of Labor Day.
Employment, as measured by the household survey, rose 240,000
in December, and the civilian unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage
point to 5.8 percent. Over the past six months, unemployment rates for
adult men have fallen sharply, consistent with the strong job gains seen
in the goods-producing sector, while joblessness among adult women has
been essentially unchanged.
Personal Income and Consumption
Personal income grew at a somewhat faster pace in the fourth
quarter than in the first three quarters of 1987. Buoyed by employment
gains, wages and salaries posted another sizable increase, and farm
income was bolstered by a large payment of farm subsidies, mainly in
October. The growth of real disposable income also strengthened in the
fourth quarter, but even with this pickup, the rise in real disposable
income during 1987 was only 2 percent.

Consumption spending fell sharply in the fourth quarter and was up
less than 1 percent over the four quarters of the year. A decline in
auto sales of more than a million units accounted for part of last
year's weakness in spending; but even excluding motor vehicles,
consumption growth slowed from a 3-1/2 percent pace in 1986 to a 1-1/4
percent rate in 1987. To a large extent, the deceleration in spending
last year reflects slowing in the growth of real disposable income. To
be sure, the stock market crash in October may have damped consumption
very recently, but this is far from clear at this point. Consumer
spending excluding motor vehicles was generally weak before the crash;
since the crash, spending has been essentially flat, with furniture and
apparel outlets reporting the weakest sales.
Sales of domestically produced cars increased in December, but not
enough to bring inventories down to acceptable levels. At year-end,
stocks of new domestic cars were 1-3/4 million units--equal to more than
a 70-day supply relative to the December sales pace. Accordingly, in
January, all of the automakers extended and expanded their December
round of incentive programs, which now cover about two-thirds of all
models. Even so, domestic auto sales were at a 6.6 million unit annual
rate in the first 20 days of January--about 3/4 of a million units below
the December pace. Sales of domestically produced trucks were at a 3.5
million unit annual rate in the first 20 days of January, down from the
4 million unit pace of December. January production apparently was only
6 million units at an annual rate; plans for coming months call for a
small pickup in assembly rates, to the 6-1/4 to 6-1/2 million unit range

sales at a brisk 3.6 million unit annual rate in December.
Business Fixed Investment
Real spending for business fixed investment is estimated to have
fallen about 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, with
declines in outlays for equipment--particularly office and computing
equipment--partially offset by increased construction activity. Over
the four quarters of 1987, real investment outlays rose 3-3/4 percent, a
sharp turnaround from the 4-3/4 percent decline in 1986. The
improvement in capital spending reflected the accelerated growth of
output last year, as well as a lagged response to the interest rate
declines and rising share prices of previous years. Equipment spending
for most major categories increased in 1987, with outlays for computing
equipment, the largest single component of business investment, up 9
percent. Moreover, petroleum drilling activity, which collapsed in
1986, rose 20 percent last year as oil prices recovered. Other sectors
of nonresidential construction were reasonably firm last year after
falling sharply in 1986.
In the fourth quarter, real outlays for nonresidential structures
rose substantially, with large increases in the office and other
commercial sectors. The sharp rise in office construction for a second
straight quarter was surprising, given the persistence of high vacancy
rates. Petroleum drilling activity declined in the fourth quarter in
response to the weakening of oil prices since late summer.

about two-thirds of equipment spending, rose for the quarter.
However, some of the rise in shipments may have gone into inventories
or exports; in addition, business purchases of motor vehicles declined
in the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead, new orders for nondefense capital goods (excluding
aircraft) were little changed in the fourth quarter, after appreciable
gains earlier in the year, while new building commitments continued to
trend up.
Business Inventories
Business inventory accumulation jumped sharply in October and
November. In total manufacturing and trade, stocks expanded at an
annual rate of $56 billion in 1982 dollars during the two months. This
pace is considerably faster than the $20 billion rate seen over the
first three quarters of last year. About half of the accumulation
occurred in the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors. However,
because manufacturing and wholesale stocks were relatively lean through
early fall, the large accumulation does not seem to have resulted in
excessive overhangs in these two sectors.
In contrast, there are some signs of excessive inventories in the
retail sector. In addition to auto dealers' stocks, certain types of
nonauto inventories may have become burdensome in recent months.
Although the accumulation of nonauto retail inventories in October and

II-15
November was not especially large, it occurred at a time when consumer
spending slowed markedly and stocks already seemed high relative to
near-term sales prospects. As a result, November inventory-sales ratios
for certain types of stores--in particular those carrying nondurable
goods other than food--shot up to the highest levels observed in the
current expansion. Inventory corrections, through slower production
growth, cutbacks in imports, or deeper discounting, may be necessary if
consumer spending remains sluggish.
In the wholesale sector, distributors of motor vehicles, electrical
goods, and machinery--categories where a large proportion of the
merchandise comes from overseas--posted sizable accumulations in October
and November. The merchant wholesalers' inventory-sales ratio rose
sharply in November based on constant-dollar data, but was still within
the range set over the preceding two years.
In conjunction with the sustained strength of industrial output,
manufacturers continued to expand their inventories in the fourth
quarter, after a significant buildup in the third quarter. By industry,
inventories in basic metals, machinery, and aircraft, where orders have
been robust through much of this year, posted large increases. Despite
the buildup, the strength in sales pushed the constant-dollar inventory-
to-shipments ratio for all manufacturing to near its lowest level in
15 years at the end of November.

Housing Markets
Housing starts posted a broad decline in the fourth quarter to a
1.52 million unit pace, down about 6-1/2 percent from the third quarter.
Despite considerable strength in construction early in 1987, the year as
a whole was about 10 percent below the 1986 average and the lowest in
five years.
In the single-family market, starts and new home sales declined in
the fourth quarter. Although mortgage interest rates fell by a full
percentage point in the wake of the stock market collapse, this
stimulative effect may have been offset by the losses in household
wealth and some erosion of consumer confidence. However, survey data
for January indicated that homebuilder views of new home sales
conditions had turned more favorable, returning to levels reported six
months earlier.
Multifamily housing starts fell sharply in December after a
surprising jump in November. For the fourth quarter as a whole,
multifamily starts were about 6-1/2 percent below the pace of recent
quarters, owing to high vacancy rates on rental apartments and the 1986
tax law changes that reduced the rate of return on such properties.
Builders remain generally pessimistic about the outlook for multifamily
construction.
Median sales prices of new homes in the fourth quarter were up 16
percent from a year earlier, similar to the year-over-year increase
recorded during the third quarter. Quality improvements and regional
shifts have accounted for about three-quarters of recent increases in

II-19
new home sales prices; the constant-quality new home price index, which
corrects for these influences, rose 3-1/2 percent over the year ending
in 1987-Q3. The median sales price of existing homes rose about 5
percent over the four quarters of 1987.
Marked regional disparities inhousing construction were apparent
in 1987. Starts were off almost 15 percent in the West and South.
Starts in the Northeast also fell somewhat but remained 17 percent above
the 1983-86 average. In north central states, housing starts held
steady last year, following a nearly 25 percent jump the previous year.
Federal Government
Real federal purchases, excluding inventory changes at the
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), were essentially unchanged in the
fourth quarter, following substantial increases in the preceding three
quarters (see chart). Over the four quarters of 1987, such purchases
were up 6 percent. Defense purchases edged down only slightly last
quarter, barely interrupting the uptrend in military spending that
continued last year despite cuts in appropriations in 1986 and 1987.
This strength reflects deliveries of equipment ordered in the first half
of the decade, as well as previously contracted research expenses. With
further reductions in appropriations for 1988, the trend in defense
purchases is widely expected to reverse. Nondefense purchases excluding
CCC, which have been quite erratic over the past two years, rose sharply
in the second quarter of last year, owing in part to a rise in spending

for the space shuttle and increased staffing by the Internal Revenue
Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Since then,
they have been about flat.
On a unified basis, federal outlays exceeded revenes by $23.9
billion in December, and over the first three months of FY1988 the
deficit has totaled $80.4 billion, nearly $17 billion greater than at
this time last year. This increase in the deficit is attributable to an
unusual rise in outlays as social security benefit payments and a
portion of military pay were shifted from early January to December 31
when the payment date fell on the long holiday weekend. Other outlay
patterns in the first quarter of the fiscal year could have been
somewhat distorted by delays in budget actions in Congress and,
therefore, may not be indicative of growth for the fiscal year as a
whole.
Revenues over the first three months of FY1988 are up about 8
percent from a year earlier. In coming months, revenue flows relative
to a year earlier are likely to slow a bit due to the further effects of
tax reform. Beginning in January, the growth of withholdings is
expected to slow, on balance, as the reduction in individual tax rates
more than offsets an increase in social security payroll taxes.
Nonwithheld taxes in January appear to be about the same as those
recorded last year when there was a large bulge in individual
declarations. At that time, payments were made for capital gains
realizations taken before the increase in rates on January 1, 1987.

This year, realizations may have been boosted by the surge in stock
market activity that accompanied the sharp swings in equity prices.
Updated budget estimates for FY1988 and projections for subsequent
years are expected from the Administration around mid-February and from
2the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on February 11. It appears
likely that the Administration will request some further revenue and
outlay changes for FY1989. The Administration's FY1989 deficit estimate
is expected to be at about the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target of $136
billion, assuming full enactment of the budget agreement reached last
November, along with the Administration's economic assumptions and
associated program cost estimates. CBO, on the other hand, is expected
to be more pessimistic about economic prospects and to show larger
deficits; the FY1989 figure, even with inclusion of the summit
agreement, is anticipated to be $20 billion to $40 billion above the
FY1989 target.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
rose 4.8 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year,
owing to a surge in outlays for construction, which had declined sharply
in the two preceding quarters. Over the four quarters of 1987, real
construction outlays increased 2 percent, well below the 9 percent
average gain during the three previous years.
Although capital spending was sluggish last year, many of the
fundamental factors affecting the demand for further outlays have not

changed. The extended decline in the school-age population turned
around in 1984 and, with changes in locational needs, more spending on
schools is expected. In addition, overcrowding in prisons has forced
many governments to improve correctional facilities, making this the
fastest growing area of state budget outlays by fiscal 1987.
The state and local deficit in its combined operating and capital
account, excluding social insurance funds, appears to have risen in the
fourth quarter to about $10 billion--its largest level since early 1975.
Expenditures have now risen faster than receipts for the third
consecutive year, especially for compensation and other nonconstruction
items.
Agricultural Production
Aggregate farm production appears to have been little changed in
1987, but remained well below its 1985 peak. (See chart.) Poultry
production rose nearly 10 percent last year, and pork production
strengthened as the year progressed. However, beef production turned
down, and the output of several of the major farm crops continued to be
restrained by government farm programs; acreage of the three main
crops--wheat, corn, and soybeans--was 15 percent less than in 1985, and
production of these crops therefore also has dropped.
The volume of agricultural exports rose sharply in 1987--the first
annual increase since 1980. Gains were widespread among grains,
oilseeds, and other farm crops. The upswing appears to reflect a
variety of factors, including U.S. export subsidies, adverse crop

II-25
conditions in some foreign countries, the markdown of price supports
beginning in 1986, and the decline in the exchange value of the dollar.
With exports up and farm crop output held down by government
programs, some of the farm sector's inventory overhang is being worked
off. As of December 1, the stocks of wheat, corn, and soybeans
(including those owned or financed by the CCC) were all down from a year
earlier, by amounts ranging from 5 to 10 percent. USDA supply-demand
projections suggest that the stocks of wheat and soybeans will be
approaching more normal levels by the end of the current marketing year,
but that the level of corn inventories still will be relatively high.
Overall, as shown in the accompanying chart, real agricultural stocks
probably fell in 1987, in contrast to the BEA estimate of a $6-1/2
billion rise.
Prices
Inflation reports were favorable late last year, in large part
owing to declines in energy prices. The consumer price index for all
urban consumers rose only 0.1 percent in December, after a 0.3 percent
increase in November. Producer prices of finished goods were unchanged
in November and fell 0.3 percent in December. Despite the recent
performance, both measures registered marked acceleration for the year
as a whole, mainly reflecting the first-half rebound in energy prices:
the CPI was up 4.4 percent compared with a 1.1 percent increase in 1986,
and the PPI for finished goods rose 2.3 percent after dropping by a
similar amount in 1986.

The CPI for energy fell about 1 percent in December, as much of
last autumn's decline in crude oil costs was passed on to the retail
level. Some additional passthrough at the retail level may show up in
January. During 1987, CPI energy prices rose more than 8 percent--after
a 20 percent decline in 1986. In contrast to energy, food prices picked
up in the December CPI, owing to a spurt in prices of fresh fruits and
vegetables. In particular, lettuce, which has been affected by a virus,
posted an exceptional increase of more than 70 percent. However, the
producer prices of fresh fruits and vegetables fell in December, and
consequently, the retail prices of these items are not likely to
continue rising at the December pace. Over the year, CPI food prices
rose 3-1/2 percent, about the same as in 1986.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose only 0.1 percent in
December. The commodities component was down 0.3 percent, with declines
in several categories, consistent with reports of larger-than-usual
markdowns. In particular, the index for apparel fell nearly 1-1/2
percent, reversing part of its hike over the preceding three months.
New car prices, with the latest round of sales incentives, were down 0.2
percent. For 1987 as a whole, the CPI excluding food and energy
increased 4.2 percent, compared with a rise of 3.8 percent in 1986,
reflecting in part the acceleration in some categories for which import
prices have risen rapidly, such as apparel, photographic equipment,
toys, and sporting goods.
At the producer level, there is little indication so far that
higher import prices have led to a pickup in price increases for

II-28
domestically produced finished goods. The index excluding food and
energy items rose about 2 percent last year, after a 2-3/4 percent
increase in 1986, with the slowdown attributable to a decline in the PPI
for autos. However, prices for (nonfood, nonenergy) intermediate and
crude materials accelerated sharply in 1987, rising about 5 percent and
22 percent respectively, after several years of relatively flat or
declining prices. The increases last year were led by metals,
chemicals, plastics, and paper--industries in which operating rates have
risen to high levels this past year. In addition, higher oil prices put
upward pressure on the prices of many petroleum derivatives, and the
decline in the exchange value of the dollar helped to boost prices for
materials that are traded in world markets.
Increases for crude nonfood materials less energy slowed in
November and December as prices receded for several items, notably for
cotton and steel scrap. Price indexes for industrial commodities have
drifted down a bit recently, but on the whole, remain in the same
general range as over the past few months. Copper prices have dropped
back from record year-end levels, and lead and cotton prices have
weakened; however, the prices for aluminum and steel scrap have picked
up again.
Wages and Labor Costs
Several recent indicators suggest that the rise in employment costs
remained at a comparatively moderate pace last year, after trending
lower during the preceding several years. The change in hourly
compensation in the private nonfarm sector, as measured by the

II-29
employment cost index (ECI), was 3.3 percent in 1987, about the same
pace as in 1986. Benefits advanced at about the same rate as wages and
salaries last year.
The hourly compensation gain in manufacturing continued to be about
3 percent last year, despite some pickup in wages for unionized workers.
Separate data on workers covered by major bargaining contracts suggest
that the higher wage change for union workers can be traced largely to
increased COLA payments. But first-year wage settlements also were
higher than these negotiated in 1986, when initial-year pay cuts were
more prevalent. Outside of manufacturing, hourly compensation
accelerated considerably in services, and to a lesser extent in trade,
while increases in finance, insurance, and real estate were smaller.
The regional dispersion in the rate of wage inflation widened
further last year. In the Northeast, where labor markets appear
relatively tight by a variety of measures, compensation rose 5 percent
last year--up from 4 percent in 1986. Elsewhere, wage increases
averaged close to 3 percent for a second year.
Separate data on collective bargaining activity last year under
major contracts (1,000 or more workers) also show only moderate pay
increases, with first-year adjustments (excluding potential COLAs)
averaging 2.2 percent and adjustments over the life of the contract
averaging 2.1 percent annually. Nevertheless, this was the first year
since 1982, when such comparisons could first be made, that current
settlements did not provide lower wage adjustments than the bargaining

agreements they replaced. Overall union wages, as measured by the
effective wage change series for major contracts, rose at a 3.1 percent
annual rate in 1987, compared with 2.3 percent the year before. Much of
the pickup reflects a larger contribution from COLAs, which responded to
the rise in CPI inflation.
Approximately 2-3/4 million workers covered under major collective
bargaining agreements (those covering 1,000 workers or more) will
negotiate contracts in 1988. The industries with large numbers of
workers scheduled to bargain include state and local government,
construction, mining, clothing manufacturing, food stores, trucking, and
the auto industry.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have fallen considerably, on balance, since the
December FOMC meeting. The markets have moved ahead without any clear
change in the federal funds rate, which has continued to fluctuate near
6-3/4 percent. Better U.S. trade performance has bolstered confidence
in the dollar, and incoming indicators showing a weakening in domestic
demand have raised hopes of weaker credit demands and further monetary
policy easing.
Key short-term market yields are off more than one-quarter percent-
age point, while bond yields have dropped three-quarters of a point or
more. The biggest declines have been registered by rates on private
short-term instruments; these have eased by a point to a point and a
half, reflecting an unwinding of the pressures that emerged before the
year-end. The prime rate was reduced one-quarter point on February 2.
Owing to the anticipatory positioning and ample provision of reserves by
the Desk, the money markets in fact did not manifest any great tightness
near the year-end statement date.
The monetary aggregates finished 1987 on a weak note, with M1 de-
clining and M2 and M3 posting only small advances in December. For the
year, M2 finished about 1-1/2 percentage points below its 5-1/2 to 8-1/2
percent range, and M3 was at the bottom of its identical range. In
January, however, all the aggregates accelerated markedly.
Credit demands appear to have moderated throughout the economy in
early 1988. Business short-term borrowing, especially in the commercial

paper market, was relatively strong in the fourth quarter of last year
as financing needs increased; preliminary data suggest a somewhat slower
pace of borrowing in January with little net change in commercial paper
after year-end. Corporate bond issuance picked up a bit in January in
response to the decline in interest rates, but it remained below its
pace earlier in 1987. After a fourth-quarter boost from transitory
factors, Treasury financing has dropped back in the current quarter.
Tax-exempt bond offerings have been light recently. The latest avail-
able data suggest some moderation of mortgage borrowing by households
and only slow expansion of consumer installment credit at the end of
1987. Overall, domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have expanded
at something under a 10 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, and
available data suggest a slightly slower pace so far in the current
quarter.
Monetary Aggregates1
The broader monetary aggregates accelerated sharply in January,
after growing little in the final two months of 1987. M2 appears to
have expanded at a 10 percent annual rate and M3 at a 7 percent rate.
Much of the pickup was attributable to a turnaround in M1, which grew at
around a 15 percent pace in January, reversing declines in both November
and December. Demand deposits rebounded in January, as did other check-

2able deposits (OCDs) .The resurgence in OCDs probably reflected, in
part, a narrower spread between rates on NOW accounts and yields on
competing instruments, such as small time deposits, as illustrated in
the chart. Stronger currency growth, which also contributed to the
January surge in M1, appears partly to have reflected seasonal factors
that do not yet fully incorporate effects of the Martin Luther King
holiday, which was observed widely beginning only in 1987.
In addition to robust M1 expansion, M2 growth was boosted by a
quickening in the growth of its nontransactions component. Hefty in-
flows to money market mutual funds likely resulted from their continued
attractiveness relative to retail deposits and market instruments.
Also, overnight RPs and Eurodollars rebounded, and runoffs of MMDAs and
savings deposits abated, more than offsetting slower, although still
robust, growth in small time deposits.
The moderation of growth in small time deposits and strengthening
of the more liquid components of M2 are consistent with some narrowing
since October in the spread between rates on small time deposits and NOW
and other liquid accounts. A narrowing of the rate spread has tended to
be reflected in a shift between small time and liquid deposits.
Growth in M3 picked up in January despite weakness in its non-M2
component, which declined as a surge in institution-only MMMFs was

with nine corporate cash managers about the behavior of demand deposits
in November and December 1987, conducted in mid-January, are presented
in an appendix. The survey pointed to the likely importance of changes
in compensating balances in explaining the fluctuations in demand
deposits in recent months.

outweighed by runoffs in net large time deposits, term RPs, and term
Eurodollars. The decline in the large time deposit component of M3
reflected a falloff in issuance by banks and thrifts, as well as
substantial purchases by money funds.
[Bank credit data for January are still being reviewed to account
for recent reporting changes.]
Business Finance
Funding needs of nonfinancial businesses appear to have risen
sharply in recent months. In the fourth quarter, the financing gap
jumped to $90 billion, owing largely to the inventory buildup. In addi-
tion, share retirements remained large, with the completion of acquisi-
tions initiated before the crash and a stepped-up rate of share repur-
chases. More recently, announcements of new mergers and buyouts have
picked up, partly reflecting the decline in interest rates and the fall
in the dollar, which has stimulated foreign interest in U.S. firms.
Despite the large needs, some sources of funds have lain virtually
untapped, owing to residual effects of the October plunge in stock
prices. Gross issues of new equities increased in January, but the
volume was still much smaller than before the crash. Issuance of bonds
with equity characteristics, such as convertibles and junk bonds, have
nearly vanished again after a brief surge in December; increasing con-
cerns about the possible effects of a weakening economic environment
have diminished investors' appetites for new public issues, though
private placements have reportedly taken up some of this slack.

Investment-grade debt, however, has responded strongly in January
to recent declines in yields, roughly 90 basis points over the inter-
meeting period. And, though commercial paper volume dipped a bit last
month, short- and intermediate-term business credit from all sources
swelled in the fourth quarter.
The broad stock price indexes have advanced 4 to 8 percent, on
balance, over the past six weeks in volatile markets. While a stream
of proposals for new stock market rules is still flowing in, some
changes already have been made. In response to the October debacle, the
futures and options exchanges raised margins on equity-index products,
but many of these increases have since been rolled back. The New York
Stock Exchange adopted restraints on program trading on days when the
Dow Jones industrial average moves 75 points, and the National
Association of Securities Dealers implemented a number of changes in its
automated system for small orders.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The combined deficit of the federal government is expected to total
about $36 billion (not seasonally adjusted) in the first quarter of
calendar 1988, down from $80 billion in the last quarter of 1987. The
fourth-quarter deficit was inflated by shifts in outlays of more than
$15 billion to December from January, as social security and some other
3. Recent monthly changes in commercial paper data are difficult to
interpret because a just completed change in the reporting panel of
commercial paper brokers and dealers and the departure of Solomon
Brothers and Paine Weber from the market late last year have introduced
potential discontinuities to these data.

III-10
payments were made on December 31, prior to the New Year holiday
weekend.
Net cash borrowing from the public should be about $32 billion this
quarter, which is likely to be largely accounted for by issuance of
marketable coupon securities, including $15 billion raised in this
week's refunding. Regular bills are being allowed to run off again, and
nonmarketable borrowing is expected to fall to about $3 billion. The
Treasury will finance the remainder of the first-quarter deficit by
reducing its cash balance.
As a result of sizable exchange market intervention, purchases of
Treasuries by foreign official institutions in the form of add-ons to
auctions have remained at above-average levels in recent months. Such
purchases amounted to almost $4 billion in December and $5 billion in
January. They are expected to continue at moderate levels for the rest
of the quarter. The high level of add-ons may have contributed to the
Treasury's recent decisions to cut back the size of some auctions,
including the $500 million reduction in the amount of 2-year notes auc-
tioned January 27. The amounts of the 3-, 10-, and 30-year issues in
the midquarter refunding also are slightly smaller than in most recent
quarters.
The Treasury may receive about $2 billion of additional cash this
quarter from the direct sale of special securities to the Mexican
government. On December 29, the Treasury announced that it would offer
up to $10 billion, face value, of 20-year zero-coupon, nonmarketable
foreign series bonds to the Mexican government early in 1988. These

III-11
bonds would be used as collateral for the principal on new Mexican bonds
that would be offered to commercial banks in exchange for discounted
amounts of outstanding Mexican bank loans.
Borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies should slow sub-
stantially to $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 1988 from its rapid,
$17.8 billion pace in the fourth quarter of 1987. A major portion of
the slowdown is likely to be among the mortgage-related agencies--Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Home Loan Banks--and could reflect both
seasonal influences and continued softness in the housing market. The
Financing Corporation also is expected to reduce its borrowing during
the first quarter, although borrowing should pick up again in the second
quarter. An increase in debt paydown by the Farm Credit Banks, owing to
still sluggish farm loan demand and loan liquidations, also contributes
to the projected falloff in borrowing in the first quarter.
In early January, President Reagan signed legislation providing new
financial assistance to the Farm Credit Banks (FCB) through debt guar-
antees and interest payments. A new institution, the Financial
Assistance Corporation, will obtain up to $4 billion of funds through
the public sale of its own 15-year debt obligations, which will be fully
guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury; the Treasury will pay interest on the
guaranteed debt for the first five years, beginning in FY1989. In
addition, the legislation provides channels to establish a secondary
market for farm real estate loans, to encourage consolidation of FCB
institutions, and to insure FCB's debt. Because the aid package sig-
nificantly reduces the riskiness of the FCB debt, interest rate spreads

III-12
between its debt obligations and Treasury securities fell substantially
at the FCB's most recent offering in late January.
Municipal Securities Markets
Offerings of tax-exempt bonds totaled $94 billion in 1987, the
lowest volume since 1983. Most of the decline in issuance since the
high water mark in 1985 has reflected the tightening of restrictions on
tax-exempt securities contained in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In addi-
tion, the higher interest rates, which prevailed through most of 1987,
were largely responsible for the reduced issuance of refunding bonds.
Although offerings of bonds for public-purpose projects fell dramati-
cally, the greatest reduction since 1985 has been in private-purpose
issues, the primary target of tax reform.

Tax-exempt bond issuance in December, at $6.8 billion, was well
below the average monthly pace for the year, and was the lowest December
volume since 1981. During most of the intervening years, year-end of-
ferings were boosted in anticipation of various changes in the tax laws.

Issuance of tax-exempt debt remained thin throughout most of January,
except at the end of the month when the Bond Buyer revenue bond index
dropped below 8 percent. This decline encouraged a rush of advance
refunding bonds.
Mortgage Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting, the average contract rate on new com-
mitments for fixed-rate conventional home mortgages has declined 50
basis points, to 10.16 percent, while the average initial rate quoted on
one-year ARMs has declined only about 15 basis points to 7.74 percent.
Thus, the initial rate advantage provided by ARMs has lessened somewhat,
but at almost 2-1/2 percentage points, it remains fairly wide by his-
torical standards. Stimulated by much lower initial rates available on
ARMs, a record 68 percent of all conventional home loans closed in early
December contained adjustable-rate features. If the recent declines in
fixed-rate credit costs are sustained, however, ARM lenders may have to
become even more aggressive in pricing ARM products to retain market
share; as fixed rates decline, many borrowers seek to lock in mortgage
costs at those rates, despite wide spreads. Rate declines prompted the
VA to lower its ceiling rate on fixed-rate mortgages a full percentage
point, to 9.50 percent effective February 1.
Owing to the higher interest rates prevailing in the early fall,
mortgage loans closed at FSLIC-insured institutions declined in November
to a seasonally adjusted $18.8 billion. Refinancings of existing
mortgages again accounted for roughly one-fifth of the origination
volume, compared with a peak share of two-fifths reached in March 1987.

The pace of refinancings of FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgages also
has remained flat in recent months.
Thrift institutions continued to be less active in the secondary
mortgage market. Sales of mortgages by thrifts fell to $5.9 billion in
November, the lowest monthly level in three years. The continued fall-
off in sales stems from the increased prevalence of adjustable-rate
lending. Inasmuch as ARMs enable thrifts to narrow the maturity gap on
their balance sheets, many institutions have tended to retain the ARMs
they originate in their portfolios, rather than sell them outright or
swap them for mortgage-backed securities. Largely because of these
increases in ARM holdings, mortgage asset growth at FSLIC-insured
thrifts picked up in November for the fifth consecutive month to
register a net increase of $10.6 billion, the second largest gain since
1984.
With the continued slowing in the pace of fixed-rate lending, is-
suance of federally related mortgage-backed pass-throughs has moderated
in recent months. Even with a pickup in December, which occurred after
seven consecutive monthly declines and largely reflected an increase in
swap activity at FNMA, issuance of mortgage pass-throughs was at less
than half the average monthly pace during the first six months of the
year. Partial data for January show pass-through issuance remaining
subdued.
Among derivative mortgage securities, offerings of CMOs dropped off
sharply in December, from a monthly pace of about $2 billion to roughly
$500 million. The decline partly reflected reduced arbitrage oppor-

tunities due to the narrowing of the spreads between mortgage pass-
throughs, which back most CMOs, and Treasury securities in early
December. Offerings of CMOs and other derivative securities may be
rebounding a bit in the first quarter of this year, however, with more
than $3-1/2 billion of CMOs issued in January. FNMA, in particular, has
been fairly active of late. Recently, the agency announced a two-class
offering of combined interest-only and principal-only securities. One
class receives all payments of principal and 60 percent of the interest;
the second class receives the remaining 40 percent of the interest.
FNMA recently announced a four-tranche REMIC issue backed by multifamily
loans, one of the first REMIC issues backed by such loans. The $203
million issue is FNMA's sixth REMIC, bringing its total issuance under
REMIC authority to $1.5 billion. FNMA now has $13.5 billion in remain-
ing REMIC authority, which expires in mid-July.
Consumer Installment C edit
Outstanding consumer installment credit grew at a 4-1/2 percent
annual rate in November, after a 5-3/4 percent October gain. The easing
of growth in November resulted mainly from much slower increases in
revolving credit and in auto credit, the latter restrained by the ab-
sence of any sales incentives until very late in the month. Partially
offsetting these slowdowns was a more rapid advance in other kinds of
borrowing. Based on results from about two-thirds of the sample, it
appears that growth of total installment credit in December probably
increased to between 9 and 10 percent, primarily reflecting a pickup in
revolving credit.

III-18
Over the first eleven months of 1987, outstanding installment debt
rose at a 5-3/4 percent annual rate, significantly below the 10-1/2
percent 1986 increase and the 17-1/4 percent average annual gain of the
1983-85 period. The slowing in 1986 was in categories other than auto
loans, while that in 1987 was in auto and revolving credit. Some decel-
eration in consumer credit in the past two years might have been ex-
pected after the exceptionally rapid increase in the early phases of

this prolonged recovery. During lengthy expansions, growth in buying
and net credit extensions typically slow as initially pent-up consumer
demands are satisfied and repayments rise in line with past credit
extensions. In the recent period, substitution of borrowing through
home equity lines of credit, which is recorded as mortgage credit, also
has curtailed growth of consumer credit as usually measured.

APPENDIX
THE BEHAVIOR OF DEMAND DEPOSITS: THE RESULTS OF
SURVEYS OF SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS AND CORPORATE CASH MANAGERS
Summary
To obtain information about the behavior of demand deposits--
especially their weakness in November and December--a survey of senior
financial officers of commercial banks and discussions with nine cor-
porate cash managers were conducted in mid-January. These inquiries
focused particularly on compensating balance arrangements and their
impact on holdings of business demand deposits. The results of the
survey indicate that, while there was sluggishness in household demand
deposits over the period, most of the weakness occurred in business
accounts and generally was widespread across types of business. Apart
from any unusual movements related to the stock market drop, the weak-
ness in demand deposits in November and December reflected most
importantly lagged adjustments to account levels to earlier increases in
interest rates. This was attributed both to closer management of
balances as rates rose in 1987 and to reductions in required compensat-
ing balances.
In addition, because a majority of banks do not allow surpluses to
be carried over past the end of the calendar year, businesses had an
incentive to reduce any excess balances before the end of 1987. Firms
shifting out of compensating balnce arrangements in favor of payment
for services by explicit fees also was cited as a factor reducing demand
deposit levels; such shifts were reported to have accelerated in 1987
and may have been concentrated in the last quarter by the prohibition
against carrying surpluses into the following year. These year-end
settlement pressures underscore the difficulty in assessing seasonal
patterns and interest-elasticities for demand deposits; year-end flows
may be affected in complex ways by rate movements and other developments
over the year. Finally, some slowing in business and financial activity
toward the end of the 1987, especially compared to previous years, also
was reported.
January's rebound in demand deposits on a month-average basis
likely reflects the unwinding of these developments to some extent;
adjustments to balance levels may have begun to reverse with recent rate
declines, shifts out of compensating balance arrangements are not being
concentrated by year-end settlement constraints, and the absence of

previously-normal year-end financial and tax-related transactions at the
end of last year has meant that the typical falloff in such transactions
after year's end was not a factor this January.
Survey results indicate that compensating balances continue to be
an important factor in business demand deposits. On average, respon-
dents to the survey indicated that slightly more than 60 percent of
business demand deposits are held under formal compensating balance
arrangements, suggesting a continued high interest elasticity for demand
deposits as a whole. There is marked variation in the structure of
compensating balance arrangements across institutions, although most use
a monthly average of the 3-month Treasury bill rate to determine their
earnings credit rate (ECR) and compute required balances monthly. Some
institutions calculate required balances based on their ECR for the
current month (or quarter) while others lag the rate by a month or more,
contributing to the sluggishness in the response of demand deposit
levels to changes in market interest rates.
Senior financial officers also were asked about NOW account be-
havior in November and December. Most reported normal growth; of the
institutions reporting less than normal growth, almost 60 percent
cited shifts to higher-yielding accounts as a factor.
Demand Deposit Activity in the November-December Period.
Nearly 50 percent of the respondents reported that demand deposit
growth at their institutions was below normal or very weak over November
and December. Only a few reported above normal demand deposit growth,
and none experienced very strong growth. Of those with lower than nor-
mal demand deposit growth, 82 percent experienced weakness in business
deposits while half cited weakness in household accounts. A higher
percentage of the largest banks reported weakness in both business and
household accounts than did smaller institutions; however, smaller in-
stitutions cited weakness in other accounts such as correspondent and
local government deposits more frequently than did the largest banks.
Higher interest rates were the most important single factor in the
weakness in demand deposits; 52 percent of the bank respondents that
reported weakness in business demand deposits attributed it to more
careful cash management by firms resulting from higher rates, and 30
percent indicated that higher interest rates (and thus higher ECRs) had
led to reduced compensating balance requirements. Given the movements
in interest rates, especially in the 3-month Treasury bill rate over the
last three months, it is likely that such stock adjustments wound down
or reversed in January.
2. Deposit ownership estimates for all insured commercial banks based
on the Demand Deposit Ownership Survey for the third quarter of 1987
show that 10.8 percent of demand deposits are held by financial
businesses, 55.5 percent by nonfinancial businesses, and 26.2 percent by
households.

III-A-3
Apart from the direct effects of higher interest rates, 35 percent
of the respondents stated that customers switching from compensating
balance arrangements to payment for services by explicit fees had de-
pressed demand deposit levels at their banks. Of all the bank
respondents, nearly 30 percent reported that such switches had ac-
celerated in 1987. (The trend away from formal compensating balance
arrangements in favor of fees is discussed more fully in a later section
on the structure of compensating balances.) In their responses to ques-
tion about changes in compensating balances, a few senior financial
officers noted that some customers had reduced their balances below the
required minimums late last year, preferring to make up the difference
with fees; one cash manager contacted stated that her firm had done this
in November and December because of cash flow problems. Several other
cash managers indicated that more firms may be looking to reductions in
compensating balances as a source of funds.
Slowing business activity also was seen to have been a factor in
the weakness in business demand deposits by 30 percent of the bank sur-
vey respondents, while about 13 percent cited reduced financial activity
associated with LBOs and merger financing. In addition, one of the cash
managers indicated that several leasing subsidiaries had abnormally low
demand deposit balances late in 1987 because of a noticeable absence of
year-end tax-related transactions. Perhaps mirroring a slowing in busi-
ness activity and transactions, reduced demands for credit and
operational services by corporate customers were reported as a factor
lowering demand balances by slightly more than a fifth of the banks with
lower than normal business deposit growth. Responses in the "other"
category were varied, including slow loan growth and the financial
troubles of a particular bank.
The weakness in business demand deposits generally was not con-
centrated in any one sector; over three-fourths of the respondents
reported weakness across all of their business accounts. Of the respon-
dents that did cite specific sectors, real estate and mortgage banking
were the most common. In terms of account structure, three-fourths of
the institutions reported that the weakness in business demand deposits
resulted from lower average balances, while about 14 percent reported a
decline in the number of accounts as some customers continued to con-
solidate demand accounts in order to reduce expenses and to facilitate
cash management. Several of the cash managers indicated that their
firms were continuing to consolidate accounts for these reasons.
The Importance and Structure of Compensating Balances
About 62 percent of balances in business demand deposits at the
respondent banks are made up of funds held under compensating balance
arrangements. This varies widely across institutions, with 12 percent
3. This figure (61.8 percent in the table) is a simple mean of the
proportions reported by the individual respondents. It appears,
(Footnote continues on next page)

III-A-4
reporting that less than 20 percent of their business demand deposits
are held under such arrangements; a quarter of the respondents cited
figures of over 80 percent.
The bulk of the banks in the panel, 83 percent, base their ECR on
the 3-month Treasury bill rate, using either the secondary market or
auction rates. Other rates also are used, including the federal funds
rate, wholesale CD rates, and, in one case, the average of competitors'
ECRs for the previous month. Smaller banks were somewhat more likely to
use a rate other than the T-bill rate than were the largest institu-
tions. One-third of all respondents indicated that their ECR is lagged
a month or more in calculating required balances, and all banks adjusted
for reserve requirements.
Compensating balance requirements are measured over a variety of
periods. While 81 percent of the respondents indicated that they
measured balances primarily on a monthly basis with another 16 percent
reporting quarterly computation periods, many of the banks indicated
that such arrangements were open to negotiation or were left to the
discretion of the account manager. As a result, some banks are comput-
ing required balances over various periods for various customers. There
also was somewhat more variation among smaller banks in the length of
computation period used than among the largest institutions.
The variation in compensating balance arrangements also is evident
in the willingness of banks to allow carryforwards of surpluses or
deficits. About two-thirds of the respondents allow carryovers from one
computation period to the next. Some allow it only for certain cus-
tomers, and a few institutions allow carryovers only of overages, not
deficits. About three-fourths of the respondents that allow period-to-
period carryovers do not allow carryovers beyond the end of the calendar
year, effectively requiring account settlement at year-end.
Only 14 percent of banks reported changes in their compensating
balance arrangements during 1987. Overall the changes appeared to be
minor, such as beginning to charge for FDIC insurance. Two banks indi-
cated customers had initiated changes in their accounts.
The survey results confirm the view expressed by corporate cash
managers that businesses have been moving away from compensating balance
arrangements in favor of reimbursing their banks for services by ex-
plicit fees. Three-fourths of the bank respondents reported that such a
(Footnote continued from previous page)
however, to be reasonably robust; when the responses are weighted by
business deposits as reported on the DDOS, the mean is 67.2 percent.
Unfortunately, while this is the preferred weighting system, only about
three-fourths of the surveyed institutions report on the DDOS.
Weighting by total demand deposits, which gives undue weight to banks
with lower than average proportions of business to total demand
deposits, yields a mean of 65.9 percent.

III-A-5
shift had been occurring and 39 percent of these indicated that it had
accelerated in 1987. Three of the cash managers contacted said that
their firms had shifted out of compensating balances over the last
quarter of 1987, and, as a result, their demand deposit levels were well
below previous normal levels. All of these firms were on a year-end
settlement basis; because they planned to began to compensate their
banks by fees as of the beginning of 1988, they reduced their balances
over the fourth quarter of 1987.
In general, the move away from compensating balances and toward fee
compensation has been underway for some time. High interest rates in
the late 1970s and in the early part of this decade spurred the rise of
cash management techniques, and more importantly, trained cash manage-
ment personnel. More recently, heightened competition among commercial
banks has led to increased unbundling of fees charged for various types
of credit and especially operational services. The combination of
spreading cash management expertise and the reserve requirement wedge,
which makes payment for services or credit by compensating balances more
expensive than by explicit fees, has continued to reduce the use of
compensating balance arrangements. Indeed, a major bank commented
that recent articles in cash management journals have spurred some
shifts by their customers. Such changes do not occur instantly; the
cash manager at a major chemical company stated that his company had
begun to review its use of compensating balances only early last year.
In addition, the cash management literature often notes that such a
shift requires the education of senior management because fees must be
budgeted and approved while the cost of compensating balances is in-
direct.
4. Despite the bulk of respondents indicating such a shift has been
occuring, 80 percent indicated that the proportion of business demand
deposits with formal compensating balance arrangements had not changed
over 1987. This may reflect the addition of new customers as well as
higher compensating balances in the first part of 1987 compared to the
first part of 1986 resulting from lower levels of interest rates. In
addition, cash managers report that some firms dropping compensating
balance arrangements switched to sweep or controlled disbursement
accounts, which have zero balances.
5. The panel of banks was asked if the National Corporate Cash
Management Association's proposed standardized account analysis had
affected their compensating balance arrangements. This proposal was an
attempt by the association to foster more standardization in reporting
of charges for servies to facilitate comparison among banks and to
increase the efficiency of cash management practices. About 90 percent
of the respondents reported it had not had any effect. Those citing an
effect generally referred to changes in the format of their monthly
statements. It was not seen as having an effect on year-end
settlements, which apparently already characterized the bulk of
accounts.

III-A-6
NOW Account Growth
Approximately 70 percent of the respondents reported that growth in
NOW accounts at their institutions had been about normal in November and
December, with 21 percent citing below normal or very weak growth. As
with demand deposits, none reported very strong growth.
Nearly 60 percent of the institutions with less than normal growth
attributed it to shifts of funds into other, higher-yielding accounts.
This is in line with the opportunity costs of holding NOW accounts over
the period. Based on the data from the Board's survey of rates paid on
retail deposits, the spread between yields on 6-month small time
deposits and NOW accounts at commercial banks widened to about 170 basis
points in the fourth quarter of last year compared to approximately 135
in the third quarter. This spread stabilized over the fourth quarter
and is estimated to have narrowed somewhat over January, suggesting that
the earlier downward stock adjustment of NOW accounts likely has begun
to reverse. Somewhat more than one-third of bank respondents were not
able to identify the reasons for the weakness in NOWs at their banks.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting on December 15-16, the weighted-average
foreign-exchange value of the dollar in terms of other G-10 currencies
has moved up on balance about 2-1/2 percent, as shown on the chart
below. The dollar has gained more against the mark and other EMS cur-
rencies -- about 3-1/4 percent; against the yen, the dollar advanced
only 1 percent.
Although the dollar steadied briefly in mid-December, shortly after
the December FOMC meeting the dollar began to decline amid reports that
the G-7 countries no longer supported the Louvre accord. The dollar
continued to fall even after the release of a statement by G-7 author-
ities on December 22 that they would intensify their efforts to coor-
dinate policies and stabilize exchange rates. Market participants
appeared to be disappointed by the absence of new measures in the state-
ment, and renewed selling pressure at the end of December brought the
dollar to historical lows near 120 yen/dollar and 1.57 marks/dollar.
The dollar's fall in late December occurred despite very heavy concerted
intervention purchases of dollars, including more than $1-1/2 billion by
the Desk.
The dollar rallied in the first week of the new year as continued
visible concerted intervention purchases evidently convinced market
participants of authorities' resolve to support the dollar. The release
on January 15 of U.S. November trade data showing a smaller than
expected deficit provided an additional upward impetus to the dollar.

IV-3
Since mid-January the dollar has steadied, and trading has been subdued
compared with the hectic activity in late December and early January.
Interest differentials on dollar assets versus both yen and mark
assets have moved against the dollar during the intermeeting period as
U.S. interest rates have fallen by more than corresponding German and
Japanese rates. Since mid-December, German short-term interest rates
have eased about 40 basis points, while Japanese short-term interest
rates are nearly unchanged. This, together with the perception of
greater strength in the Japanese economy, may have contributed to the
noticeable strengthening of the yen-mark cross rate during the inter-
meeting period.
The Desk's intervention purchases
totaled about $2.3 billion, of which slightly less than $1 billion were
bought against yen (entirely for the Treasury) and the rest were pur-
chased against marks. Because its yen balances were depleted by these
large drawings, the Treasury made provisions to exchange some of its
holdings of SDRs for yen. In an arrangement announced at the time of
Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita's visit to Washington in mid-January,
the government of Japan agreed to exchange yen for U.S. SDR holdings.
The Treasury also asked the IMF to arrange the exchange of yen for SDRs
with member countries of the Fund other than Japan as the yen became

IV-4
available and to make certain payments to the United States in yen. In
several transactions under the latter arrangements, the Treasury has
augmented its yen balances by about $215 million equivalent.
Despite the wide swing in the dollar's value during the intermeet-
ing period, the relationships among currencies within the EMS parity-
grid remained fairly stable. As the dollar gained against the mark in
January, several EMS countries took the opportunity to lower interest
rates and rebuild mark reserves. The Bank of France cut its money-
market intervention rate twice by a total of 50 basis points to 7-1/4
percent .The
Netherlands also cut its discount rate twice by a total of 50 basis
points to 3-1/4 percent, and Belgium reduced its discount rate by 25
basis points to 6-3/4 percent.
Following recent expressions of
concern by U.K. authorities about inflationary pressures, on February 1
the Bank of England announced an increase in its money-market dealing
rate by 50 basis points to 8-7/8 percent, and U.K. clearing banks
followed with matching increases in base lending rates to 9 percent.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreigners sold, net, more than $6.5 billion in U.S. stocks in
November. (See line 2b of the Summary Table of U.S. International
Transactions.) This decline is four times larger than the next largest

IV-5
monthly decline recorded in the past decade. Most of the selling came
from Europe, especially Switzerland and the United Kingdom, while Japan
and Canada registered small net purchases. In contrast, private for-
eigners purchased, net, more than $5 billion in U.S. Treasury securities
in the month. (See line 3.) Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom
accounted for most of these net purchases. Foreign net purchases of
corporate bonds remained small in November, owing in part to uncertainty
about the dollar exchange rate which discouraged new Eurobond issues;
new issues also were very light in December. For the fourth quarter as
a whole, it is likely that foreign private security transactions pro-
duced a small net capital outflow.
Banks reported relatively modest inflows, $2 billion, in November
(see line 1), as inflows to U.S. offices of foreign-based banks were
offset by advances by U.S.-based banks to their own foreign offices.
The advances by U.S. banks were partly in response to reduced funding of
foreign affiliates by U.S. bank holding companies. Partial data indi-
cate that foreign-based banks increased substantially their liabilities
to their own foreign offices at the end of December.
Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbank residents, which include bank
holding company deposits at affiliated banks, declined markedly in the
fourth quarter (line 3 of the Banking Table); this capital inflow, if
reported accurately, will appear in the fourth-quarter data on U.S.
international transactions as 'Other Capital Flows' (line 8 of the
Summary Table).

Recorded net official purchases of U.S. assets were a moderate $1.7
billion in November,
Partial data from the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicate official G-10 holdings in the
United States rose by about $6 billion in December. For the fourth
quarter as a whole, recorded foreign official inflows amounted to about
$20 billion.
Newly released data on U.S. international transactions in the third
quarter show that foreign direct investment in the United States is
continuing at a record pace -- the total for the first three quarters of
1987 exceeded the near-record total for 1986. (See line 7 of the Summary
Table.) U.S. direct investment abroad is running at about its 1986
pace. These data, however, include earnings reinvested abroad which
reflect the positive influence of the lower dollar, suggesting a fall
off in the underlying rate of investment abroad.
For the year as a whole, several trends are now apparent. Private
net foreign purchases of U.S. securities, which amounted to about one-
half of the U.S. current account deficit in 1986 and a third of the
deficit in the first three quarters of 1987, diminished in importance
and may have produced a small net capital outflow in the fourth quarter.
Capital inflows through banking transactions increased in importance and
may have reached $50 billion for the year. Foreign direct investment in
the United States accelerated while U.S. direct investment abroad was
little changed from the 1986 pace. Direct official inflows have

IV-9
increased and likely amounted to about one-quarter of the 1987 current
account deficit.
Merchandise Trade
U.S. merchandise trade data for November showed a substantial
decline in the deficit, not seasonally adjusted, from October. On a
seasonally adjusted basis, shown in the table below, the November im-
provement remains. Nonetheless, for October-November combined the mer-
chandise trade deficit widened slightly from its third-quarter rate.

1. Through November, at an annual rate
2. Preliminary data, subject to revision.
Nonagricultural exports increased at an
in October-November from the third quarter.annual rate of $14 billion
Much of this strength is

IV-10
attributable to exports of machinery, particularly for communications
and business uses. Increases were also recorded in the value of in-
dustrial supplies, most noticeably for chemicals. Growth in these areas
more than offset a decline, on a seasonally adjusted basis, in exports
of civilian aircraft. The bulk of the increase in nonagricultural ex-
ports was in shipments to Canada and Western Europe.
The decline in agricultural exports, $2 billion at an annual rate,
reflected a slowdown in exports of grains and soybeans from the third
quarter that dominated a substantial increase in cotton exports. How-
ever, prospects for agricultural exports remain promising due to large
sales of wheat to the Soviet Union and China. The strong third-quarter
pace of agricultural exports may well be repeated in the first half of
1988.
Non-oil imports rose at an annual rate of $17 billion in October-
November over the third quarter, with increases concentrated in
industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive imports from Canada.
Imports of non-durable industrial supplies and steelmaking materials
showed exceptional growth in value terms, although much of this increase
reflected higher prices (see discussion below). Across regions, in-
creases in imports from Canada and Western Europe were only partially
offset by decreases in imports from newly industrialized countries in
Asia.
Oil imports fell at an annual rate of more than $3 billion in
October-November from the third quarter as both prices and volumes de-
clined. The downward movement in prices, due in part to increases in

IV-11
production by Arab Gulf producers, may have led to a slowing of inven-
tory accumulation and the decline in volume.

Import and Export Prices
BLS data on prices of imports (excluding oil) and exports, shown in
the top half of the table below, exhibit an accelerating pattern in the
fourth quarter. This acceleration brought the rate of increase in
prices in the fourth quarter somewhat above those experienced in the
first half of 1987.
For imports, the fourth-quarter reversal of the third-quarter slow-
down is most apparent in the prices of capital goods, automobiles and
parts, and consumer goods. In addition, the continued strength in
prices of industrial supplies was maintained by a strong fourth-quarter
surge in prices of nondurable supplies. These patterns parallel the
movements in the dollar exchange rate: steady decline during the first
and second quarters, a leveling off in the third quarter, and a further
decline in the fourth quarter.
After falling for three years, prices of exports rose 6.9 percent
on average in 1987. The pattern of a fourth-quarter rebound from the
third quarter is mostly explained by changes in the prices of exports of
foods, feeds, and beverages; in particular by rising prices of wheat,
corn, and rice.

A fourth-quarter slackening in the prices of exports of durable
industrial supplies helped explain a similar movement in industrial
supplies as a whole. Over the year, prices in these two categories
moved in tandem with their counterparts on the import side. The same
cannot be said of prices of exports of business machines. These prices
declined, while prices of imports of business machines rose. Consumer
goods and automobiles and parts recorded price increases in the fourth
quarter that were consistent with their slow rate of price increase over
the entire year.
Alternative measures of prices of U.S. imports and exports, includ-
ing the implicit deflator and fixed-weighted price indexes reported in
the GNP accounts, showed a much smaller increase in prices of imports
and exports in the fourth quarter (see the bottom half of the table.)
The GNP price series for the fourth quarter were released before the BLS
price data were available and it is likely that the GNP export prices
will be revised up somewhat in light of the BLS data. The GNP data also
differ substantially from the BLS data due to different treatments of
prices of raw materials, intermediate goods, and especially business
machines. We anticipate that even after revisions to take into account
the fourth-quarter BLS data, the GNP price measures will continue to
show substantially smaller increases in overall prices of imports and
exports through the fourth quarter, as compared to the BLS data.
Data on U.S. international transactions in the third quarter, re-
leased last month, showed nearly a $10 billion (SAAR) increase in the
current account deficit from the second quarter, with the trade deficit

IV-14
about unchanged. The bulk of the increase was due to a decline in net
investment income payments, which turned negative for the first time
since before 1960. The drop in net investment income reflected both a
deterioration in the net portfolio position of the U.S. and, due to a
larger stock of foreign direct investment in the U.S., an increase in
direct investment payments.
U.S. bank lending to foreigners.
The (nominal) dollar value of U.S.-chartered banks' claims on for-
eigners increased $3.9 billion in the third quarter of 1987. The
average foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of other G-10
currencies rose 0.4 percent during the period. After adjustment for the
effect of exchange rate changes on nondollar claims, total claims on
foreigners are estimated to have increased by about $4 billion.
The nominal value of claims on non-OPEC developing countries de-
clined $2.4 billion in the third quarter. This included a decline of
$700 million in claims on Latin American countries, of which $200 mil-
lion was accounted for by a decrease in claims on Mexico. Beginning
inSeptember, Mexican private sector borrowers made settlements on their
own bank debt at significant discounts. Overall, such transactions were
estimated to have totalled about $3.5 billion in the third and fourth
quarters combined, and took place at an average discount of 50 percent
of the face value of debts repurchased--approximately the secondary
market "price" of Mexican public sector debt.
The decline in claims on Asia and Africa of $1.7 billion was mainly
accounted for by declines in claims on Taiwan (about $700 million) and

Korea (about $550 million). In the third quarter, Taiwan was attempting
to reduce commercial bank dollar borrowings that had increased in the
second quarter in anticipation of domestic currency appreciation against
the dollar. Korea continued to pursue a policy of reducing external
debt, which has contributed to a steady decline in U.S. bank claims on
that country since the first half of 1984.

In the fourth quarter, press announcements indicate that 20 of the
largest 50 bank holding companies announced additions to loan loss
reserves of approximately $2.3 billion linked to claims on developing
countries. As a whole, the group that announced reserving actions
raised their average of announced reserves against developing country
exposure to around 55 percent. This figure, however, should be regarded

Indicative prices for loans to Brazil fell nearly 50 percent from
early December 1986 to recently recorded lows in September and October
of 1987. Data for the third week of January 1988, however, indicate
that prices have risen more than 15 percent from the lows in 1987. The

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
After strong growth of real GNP in the third quarter of 1987,
economic activity in the major foreign industrial nations in the fourth
quarter was mixed. Recent data on production, orders, and sales
indicate that Japanese growth continued to be robust, as was also the
case in the United Kingdom and Canada, but that the pace of economic
expansion subsided in Germany, France, and Italy. Low inflation
prevailed in foreign G-7 nations; however, rates of increase in prices
have risen lately in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan.
External imbalances have persisted in several of the major foreign
countries; Germany registered record trade and current account surpluses
for 1987, and Japan's 1987 trade surplus was down only slightly from the
previous year's record high while the current account edged up.
Although the volume of German and Japanese imports has increased
steadily, real exports have continued to rise in Germany while declining
in Japan. The sustained strength of German export performance is to a
degree the counterpart of the recent deterioration of the trade balances
of its major European trading partners: France, the United Kingdom, and
Italy. On January 2, President Reagan and Prime Minister Mulroney
initialed the U.S.-Canadian Free Trade Agreement which, if approved by
the legislatures of the two countries, will start to be implemented on
January 1, 1989.

IV-22
The Japanese government has announced a mildly stimulative budget
for the coming fiscal year. The German government, concerned about
higher budget deficit projections for 1988, has proposed a fiscal cor-
rection for 1989. As a result of shifting financial market conditions,
both Germany and France announced changes in the monetary aggregates
that will be targeted in 1988.
Individual country notes. Data on real economic activity in Japan
in the fourth quarter indicate continued strong and broad-based growth.
In December, the industrial production index (s.a.) rose 1.4 percent
attaining a level 8.5 percent above a year ago, while the unemployment
rate (s.a.) declined again to 2.6 percent. Capacity utilization (s.a.)
rose again in November but still remained below the peak level of mid-
1985. Average total new machinery orders (s.a.) in October and November
were 9 percent higher than in the third quarter; some of the rise in
orders reflected increased government orders in connection with public
works projects. Recent indicators of consumer spending also suggest
continued strength. Average retail sales (s.a.) in October and November
rose 1.2 percent from the third quarter while real consumption expendi-
tures of working households (s.a.) increased 0.5 percent during this
period. Housing starts (s.a.) rose 2.6 percent on average in October
and November from the third quarter, slowing from the rapid growth of
the second and third quarters.
Inflation, while higher than earlier in 1987, has remained low in
recent months. In January, the Tokyo index of consumer prices (n.s.a.)
was 1.2 percent above its year-earlier level. For 1987 as a whole,

IV-23
consumer prices increased 0.4 percent. Wage gains have remained modest.
In the upcoming spring wage round, unions plan to request a 6 to 7 per-
cent nominal wage increase while employers intend to resist significant
wage hikes. At the 1987 negotiations, workers settled for a record low
3.6 percent nominal increase.
In 1987, Japan registered a record high current account surplus of
$86.4 billion compared with a surplus of $85.5 billion in 1986. Japan's
trade surplus (s.a.) widened in December bringing the total for 1987 to
$79.6 billion compared with $82.5 billion in 1986. In 1987, exports
increased 9.6 percent and imports rose 18.2 percent in dollar terms.
Volume estimates show that total exports declined 1.9 percent in 1987
while imports increased 8.2 percent.
The Japanese government has proposed a budget for FY 1988-89
(starting April 1) that appears to be more stimulative than recent
budgets. The general account budget calls for outlays to increase 4.8
percent over the initial FY 1987-88 budget, the largest such increase
since FY 1982-83. However, inclusion of the large July supplemental
budget in the FY 1987-88 baseline reduces the increase in proposed FY
1988-89 general account expenditure to 0.9 percent. In FY 1988-89,
budget expenditures excluding debt service costs and local revenue shar-
ing are scheduled to increase 1.2 percent, the first increase in 6
years. Outlays in the off-budget Fiscal Investment and Loan Program
(FILP), excluding portfolio management transactions, are slated to in-
crease 6.8 percent.

IV-24
Monetary conditions remain relaxed. The broad aggregate M2+CDs
(n.s.a.) fell 0.1 percent in December resulting in a 12-month growth
rate of 11.5 percent. For the first quarter of 1988, the Bank of Japan
predicts that broad money will continue to grow at an annual rate of
about 12 percent.
Economic activity in Germany in the final months of 1987 slowed
considerably from the brisk third-quarter pace. The Federal Statistics
Office estimated average real GNP growth in 1987 to be 1.7 percent,
based on data through October. Data for the fourth quarter will not be
released until March but are expected to show less than half the 5.7
percent (s.a.a.r.) growth rate recorded in the third quarter. Indus-
trial production rose in December resulting in a fourth-quarter average
1.3 percent above that of the comparable period last year. The
unemployment rate in December increased slightly to 9 percent. The
volume of total new manufacturing orders declined again in November, as
a result of declines in both foreign and domestic orders.
The trade surplus surged to $8 billion (n.s.a.) in December bring-
ing the total for 1987 to $65.8 billion, compared with $52.5 billion in
1986. Exports and imports (in DM) are estimated to have fallen 0.3
percent and 1.2 percent, respectively, during the year. In real terms,
exports are estimated to have risen 2.4 percent while real imports rose
5 percent. The current account surplus fell slightly in December bring-
ing the 1987 total to $44.6 billion, compared with $37.7 billion in
1986.

IV-25
In January, Finance Minister Stoltenberg announced that the 1988
federal budget deficit could exceed DM40 billion, (or about 2 percent of
GNP) higher than the DM29.5 billion figure projected last November when
the budget was passed by the Bundestag. The DM10 billion difference in
the federal deficit stems from a DM6 billion reduction in revenues and
increased transfers to the European Community of about DM4 billion. The
higher deficit will require the passage of a supplemental budget by the
Bundestag during the summer. Stoltenberg also announced that the 1989
federal deficit will be reduced by the amount of the 1988 budget overrun
through increased consumption taxes, reduced subsidies, and reduced
government spending. He asserted that there was no room for advancing
the tax cuts scheduled for 1990 to augment the DM14 billion tax cut that
was put in effect January 1, 1988.
On January 21, the Bundesbank announced a target range of 3 to 6
percent growth for M3 between the fourth quarter of 1987 and that of
1988. This is the first time that the Bundesbank has announced a
monetary target for M3; the Bundesbank had targeted central bank money
(CBM) since 1975. For the last two years, growth in CBM exceeded target
ranges set by the Bundesbank. In 1987, CBM grew 8.1 percent, above the
3 to 6 percent target range. Bundesbank officials noted that M3 growth
during 1987 was within the 3 to 6 percent range--from the fourth quarter
of 1986 to that of 1987, M3 grew 6 percent.
In France, industrial production stagnated in October and November
while inflation remained low. In 1987, the trade balance worsened sig-
nificantly, registering a $5.3 billion deficit compared with a small

IV-26
surplus last year. In December, the Bank of France announced a renewal
of the 1987 target of 4 to 6 percent growth in M2 for 1988, but dropped
the 3 to 5 percent target range for M3. Although the M2 target will
likely be met in 1987, growth of M3 has been consistently above its
target range. The rapid growth of M3 during 1987 was due in part to
portfolio shifts associated with financial market reform in France.
Recent data suggest that real activity in the United Kingdom
remains very strong. The average measure of real GDP increased by 8.8
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter. Industrial production declined
slightly in November, but remained 3.5 percent above its year-earlier
level. The unemployment rate declined to 9.4 percent (s.a.) in
December, the 18th consecutive monthly decline. The 12-month rate of
consumer price inflation declined to 3.7 percent in December. However,
the estimated underlying rate of increase of average earnings rose in
November for the second consecutive month, moving up to an annual rate
of 8-1/4 percent.
Economic growth in Canada continued at a rapid pace; the index of
industrial production (s.a.) rose in November to a level 8.8 percent
above its year-earlier level and the unemployment rate fell to 8.1 per-
cent in December, a six-year low. The initial phase of tax reform took
effect January 1. The overall package will be phased in over the next
two years and will lower income tax rates, substitute a three-bracket
tax system for the current ten brackets, and introduce a comprehensive
national sales tax.

IV-27
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Under a new finance minister, Brazil in early February made a
voluntary $350 million payment on overdue January interest to banks and
announced its desire to normalize relations with the international
financial community, including the IMF. The Mexican government imple-
mented a comprehensive new anti-inflation program in mid-December. Also
in December, Mexico announced a plan to retire some of its debt to for-
eign banks at a discount in exchange for new, marketable bonds. Monthly
inflation in Argentina was 3.4 percent in December, down from 10.3 per-
cent in November, but is estimated at 9 percent in January. The first
auction under the new Argentine debt-equity conversion program was held
in January. The Paris Club rescheduled all of Ecuador's obligations to
its official creditors in January. Colombia and its creditor banks
signed a $1 billion loan on January 8.
Individual Country Notes. A new Brazilian Finance Minister,
Mailson da Nobrega, was appointed in late December, after Bresser
resigned because his fiscal proposals were not embraced by President
Sarney. Nobrega, a career civil servant, has announced that Brazil
wants to normalize relations with external creditors. Brazil has made a
voluntary $350 million payment on overdue January 1988 interest to the
commercial banks from its reserves and is seeking agreement on a medium-
term financing agreement with the banks. Further interest payments out
of reserves may be contingent on the progress of those negotiations.
Brazil has stated its intention to begin discussions with the IMF on its

IV-28
economic policies, which could lead to a stand-by agreement with the
Fund.
The Brazilian trade surplus remains strong with surpluses of over
$1 billion realized in November and December. The trade surplus for
1987 was $11.2 billion, almost $3 billion larger than the trade surplus
in 1986. Inflation is accelerating; it was over 14 percent in December
and over 16 percent in January. Inflation for 1987 (Dec./Dec.) was 365
percent.
The Mexican government implemented a comprehensive new anti-infla-
tion program in mid-December as part of a social compact with labor and
business that helped to avert a threatened general strike. The control-
led peso was devalued by 18 percent, the maximum duty on imports was
halved to 20 percent, the prior licensing requirement was eliminated for
many imports, and the central bank mandated a 10 percent reduction in
outstanding domestic bank loans from December 1987 to January 1988--
approximately a 25 percent reduction in real terms. All wages were
increased by 15 percent on December 15, and the minimum wage was raised
by another 20 percent on January 1. Public sector prices were raised
sharply in December to catch up with past inflation and were then frozen
until March. The government hopes that the new program will result in
lower inflation and, with it, lower interest rates and interest payments
on domestic debt that will help reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 10
percent of GDP in 1988 from an estimated 17.4 percent in 1987.
In December, the CPI was 14.8 percent higher than November and 160
percent higher than a year earlier. The preliminary estimate for

IV-29
January inflation is 12 to 16 percent. In the four weekly auctions held
in January, the 28-day Treasury bill rate averaged 157 percent, 33 per-
centage points above the December average.
As the controlled peso has been held almost unchanged since the
mid-December devaluation, the gain in international competitiveness
stemming from that devaluation was rapidly lost. On February 1, Mexico
announced a resumption of daily devaluations of the controlled peso, but
only at a rate of 2.8 percent for the month of February.
On December 29, Mexico announced a plan to retire some of its debt
to foreign banks at a discount in exchange for up to $10 billion in new,
marketable 20-year bonds paying 1-5/8 percent over LIBOR. The principal
of the new bonds will be collateralized with U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
bonds that Mexico will acquire with up to $1.9 billion of its foreign
exchange reserves. The deadline for bids in the auction to determine
the exchange ratio is February 19, subject to a possible one-week exten-
sion by Mexican authorities. Bids will be accepted or rejected within
five business days of the bid deadline.
Consumer price inflation in Argentina was 3.4 percent in December,
down from 10.3 percent in November and 19.5 percent in October. The
preliminary estimate for January inflation is 9 percent. Inflation from
December 1986 to December 1987 was 175 percent, up from 82 percent in
1986. The Argentine Congress passed a package of revenue measures on
January 8, including taxes on fuels and checking transactions and a
forced savings scheme. Government authorities are projecting that the
package will raise about 3 percent of GDP in new revenues. Also in

IV-30
January, the first auction under the new debt-equity conversion program
was held. Six projects, out of a total of 15 proposed projects, are
expected to be approved soon. These six projects represent a total of
$54 million in external debt. The discounts at which the debt will be
converted into australs range from 35 to 40 percent. The repatriation
of capital from debt-equity conversions will be prohibited for 10 years,
remittances of profits will be prohibited for 4 years.
An IMF mission visited Argentina in January to evaluate whether
economic policy adjustments are sufficient to keep the stand-by arrange-
ment on track. IMF Executive Board approval would release the third
(SDR 165.5 million) tranche of the stand-by arrangement and is a precon-
dition for the release of an additional $550 million in new commercial
bank loans. Argentina has been accumulating substantial interest
arrears to external creditors in recent months and may experience cash
flow problems in February when a $440 million amortization of external
bonds is due.
The Paris Club rescheduled $275 million of Ecuador's obligations
to its official creditors in January. All maturities falling due
between January 1, 1988 and February 28, 1989 were rescheduled
(including previously rescheduled debt) along with interest arrears.
Commitments to the $350 million commercial bank loan agreed to in
October 1987 are currently being sought. An SDR 75.4 million stand-by
arrangement and SDR 42.7 million CFF drawing were approved by the IMF
Executive Board in early January; the CFF and the first (SDR 15.1
million) tranche of the stand-by were drawn in January as well.

The two front runners in Ecuador's first-round presidential elec-
tions on January 31 were center-left candidate Rodrigo Borja and radical
Abdala Bucaram. Run-off elections will be held in May. Immediately
following the elections, the sucre depreciated by approximately 14 per-
cent from its pre-election level.
Colombia and its creditor banks signed a $1 billion loan on
January 8--$60 million less than initially agreed upon. The Colombian
authorities hope to raise the $60 million balance through other means.
