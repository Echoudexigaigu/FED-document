DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity has continued to expand in the current quarter,
but just how rapidly is not yet clear. Strong gains in employment and
hours through February suggest another sizable increase in GNP.
However, the fragmentary evidence on domestic final spending points to a
more moderate advance, led by rebounds in auto sales and business fixed
investment. After a substantial buildup during the fourth quarter,
inventory accumulation appears to have slowed, owing largely to a
decline in auto dealers' stocks. The unemployment rate has edged lower,
and capacity utilization rates remain high in a number of materials
industries; nonetheless, there is as yet no clear sign of generalized
wage or price acceleration.
Labor Markets
The labor market surveys indicate continued strength in economic
activity during the first two months of this year. Employment, as
measured by the household survey, rose 280,000 in February, after an
even larger gain a month earlier, and the civilian unemployment rate
edged down to 5.7 percent.
According to the establishment survey, nonfarm payroll employment
posted an average monthly gain of about 350,000 in January and February,
a pace exceeding the sizable increases during the second half of last
year. Surprisingly large employment gains occurred in trade, and hiring
in services was brisk over the two months. However, employment in the
finance industry fell 10,000 in February, the first decline since the

stock market crash. Construction employment moved erratically over the
two months, but the February level was up substantially from December.
Factory employment posted comparatively small increases in January and
February.
For all production and nonsupervisory workers on private
nonagricultural payrolls, the index of aggregate hours worked rose 1
percent in February to a level 1.2 percent above the fourth-quarter
average. In manufacturing, the small employment gains were offset by a
decline in the average workweek, and aggregate hours of production
workers in February were little changed from the fourth-quarter average.
Although still high by historical standards, the factory workweek has
declined, on balance, since peaking in October at 41.3 hours.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
After rising at an annual rate of 8 percent during the second half
of last year, industrial production has decelerated in recent months.
Total industrial production is estimated to have risen 0.3 percent in
January and 0.2 percent in February. The level of production last month
was up about 3-1/2 percent, at an annual rate, from the fourth quarter
of 1987.
Output of business equipment posted solid gains during the first
two months of this year, bringing the February reading to 8 percent, at
an annual rate, above the fourth-quarter average. Growth in this sector
apparently stems from a combination of robust foreign and domestic
demand. In recent months, production gains have been particularly
strong for construction and mining equipment, special industrial

machinery (which includes capital goods for the food, textiles, and
paper industries), boiler shop products, and medical instruments.
Output of computers, which had surged during the fourth quarter,
decelerated in January and February, but the February level of output
still was substantially higher than the fourth-quarter average.
In the motor vehicles components of both consumer goods and
business equipment, a slight increase in auto assemblies last month was
more than offset by a decline in trucks. Current schedules indicate
that both auto and truck assemblies will show gains in March, which can
be expected to add about 0.2 percentage point to the growth of total
industrial production.
After surging last fall, output of consumer home goods,
particularly appliances, has dropped considerably since November.
Moreover, production of clothing, which declined at an annual rate of
2-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, remained weak in January and
February. These cutbacks may reflect a response by producers to
attempts by retailers to control stocks. In contrast, output of other
nondurable consumer goods has been strong in recent months, boosted by
advances for both chemical and paper products (the former includes drugs
and medicines, and the latter, periodicals and books).
The strength in production of nondurable consumer goods is
surprising, as real spending for those goods declined at an annual rate
of 2-1/2 percent during the fourth quarter, and appears to have weakened
further during the current quarter. Domestic producers apparently
benefited somewhat in the second half of 1987 from the depreciation of

II-6
the dollar, which contributed to a decline in real imports of nondurable
consumer goods, but not nearly enough to offset the weakness in domestic
spending. In this light, the recent gains in output do not appear to be
sustainable unless spending picks up.
Production of materials, which had soared during the second half of
last year, slipped a little for a second month in February. This edging
off is attributable to declines in a number of industries, including
basic metals, which surged during the second half of last year, and
parts for durable consumer goods. In addition, production of textile
materials has been weak since last fall, mirroring the weakness in
output of clothing and automobiles. In contrast, output of chemicals
and parts for capital goods has continued to rise.
Capacity utilization in February remained at 82.4 percent, the same
as in the preceding two months. Operating rates have moderated somewhat
in a few industries--particularly textiles and primary metals--where
utilization rose last year and producer prices accelerated.
Nevertheless, capacity constraints still are evident in some materials
industries, most notably paper, aluminum, and specialty steel. In
contrast, utilization rates in a number of advanced-processing
industries that are benefiting from the depreciation in the dollar--for
example, nonelectrical machinery, instruments, and miscellaneous
manufacturing (which includes jewelry and toys)--are not high by
historical standards.

II-7
Business Inventories
After a substantial runup in the fourth quarter, the rate of
business inventory accumulation appears to have slowed early this year.
In current cost terms, inventories in all manufacturing and trade rose
at an annual rate of $48 billion in January, considerably less than the
$82 billion accumulation during the fourth quarter.
The recent slowing in inventory accumulation resulted in large
measure from a substantial liquidation at auto dealers. Domestic
manufacturers cut auto assemblies sharply during the first two months of
this year, to an annual rate of about 6 million units. Consequently,
with the pickup in sales, much of the inventory overhang in this sector
was quickly eliminated. Dealer stocks at the end of February were down
to a 62-day supply relative to the average selling pace over the past 12
months. Domestic automakers have scheduled production at a 7 million
unit annual rate in the second quarter, up about 3/4 of a million units
from the first-quarter rate. Indeed, production plans for the second
quarter have been revised up repeatedly since early January, coincident
with the rebound in sales.
The weakness in production of other consumer goods, such as apparel
and appliances, also appears consistent with some trimming of retail
stocks. Although the data lag a month, stocks held at apparel stores,
which were burdensome through much of the holiday selling season, showed
a significant decline in January. For the overall G.A.F. grouping
(which includes general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and
appliance stores), stocks were little changed in January after a sizable

accumulation during the latter part of 1987, and the inventory-sales
ratio held steady at the relatively high level that has prevailed since
October of last year. In contrast to the slowing in stockbuilding at
the retail level, inventories of merchant wholesalers, especially of
durable goods such as motor vehicles, electrical goods, and machinery,
have risen significantly further in recent months, and the aggregate
inventory-sales ratio has moved higher.
Stock accumulation in the manufacturing sector continued at a brisk
pace in January, but inventories are not high relative to shipments by
historical standards. A considerable portion of the January inventory
runup was in the nondefense capital goods category, where production and
sales appear fairly strong. In contrast, some manufacturing
industries--for example, producers of appliances and textiles--may have
begun to curtail their stock expansion efforts, apparently in response
to the weakness in consumer spending.
Personal Income and Consumption
Income growth remained relatively strong early in the year,
providing continued support for consumer spending. Total personal
income was affected by a host of special factors in January, including
lower farm subsidy payments, higher personal contributions for social
insurance, and an increase in federal transfer payments owing to COLA
1. As a result of the Census Bureau's revisions to retail sales and
inventories, inventory-sales ratios for apparel and general merchandise
stores are slightly lower in 1987 than those shown previously, but the
current levels of stocks in these sectors still appear to be excessive.
In particular, the large runup last year in stocks at apparel stores is
still evident in the revised data, and the inventory-sales ratio for
general merchandise stores has trended up, on balance, since last
spring.

II-10
and other adjustments. However, even abstracting from these factors,
personal income in January continued to grow at about the pace of late
last year, reflecting, in part, continued sizable increases in wages and
salaries. In addition, a drop in personal tax payments attributable to
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 boosted disposable personal income in January
to a level nearly 1 percent above the fourth-quarter average.
Spending on domestic motor vehicles has been surprisingly strong.
Sales of domestically produced cars have averaged 7.9 million units
(annual rate) since early February, while domestic light truck sales
have been 4.3 million units. This recent pace of sales is well above
the rate prevailing in December and January, and probably reflects at
least in part the continued availability of sales incentives. Those
available from Ford and GM, which now cover about three-fourths of their
models, were scheduled to expire at the end of February, but have been
extended until the end of April and mid-May, respectively. Chrysler's
incentive programs, which cover about 80 percent of their models, are
open-ended. In contrast to the strength in sales of domestic makes,
foreign cars and light trucks currently are selling at rates below those
registered during the fourth-quarter.
Excluding motor vehicles, consumption spending apparently remained
relatively sluggish early in the quarter, despite strong income
2growth. Retail sales data for January and February show declines in
2. Last week, the Census Bureau released revised estimates of retail
sales back to 1983. Revisions for the 1983-86 period, which were based
on information from the 1986 Annual Retail Survey, mostly were small.
However, revisions for 1987, which reflected new information on the
status of firms in the sample, were much larger. The revised data show
stronger growth in sales for the year as a whole; however, a slowdown in
spending during the latter part of the year is still evident in the
revised data. BEA will incorporate these revisions into the national
income accounts at the time of the July annual benchmarking.

ominal spending on nondurables. However, outlays for durables outside
f motor vehicles appear to have retraced part of their fourth-quarter
decline. (More complete information on personal income and consumer
spending through February, will be available in the Greenbook
supplement.)
Business Fixed Investment
After edging down last quarter, spending for business equipment
appears to have strengthened considerably in the current quarter, led by
substantial gains for office and computing equipment. Shipments of such
equipment jumped 25 percent between November and January, before
declining somewhat in February. Industry sources confirm that demand
for computing equipment is healthy, and production of business machines
has advanced strongly since last fall. Demand also appears to be solid
for most other types of equipment. Excluding office and computing
equipment (as well as the aircraft group), shipments in January and
February stood 2-1/2 percent above the fourth-quarter average, despite
the decline in shipments recorded last month. Further, aircraft
shipments--as computed by BEA's methodology--have risen sharply from the
fourth quarter. This widespread resilience of shipments suggests
that any adverse impact from the stock-market crash on domestic
equipment demand has been minor.
3. The table on the next page, "Business Capital Spending Indicators,"
includes an innovation in our reporting of the data on shipments; the
industry detail has been aggregated in a memo item in such a way as to
replicate better the BEA's technique for translating shipments into GNP
expenditures. In particular, the BEA does not use the M3 report to
estimate shipments of aircraft. Instead, BEA employs the shipments data
contained in the Current Industrial Report entitled "Civil Aircraft and
Aircraft Engines" and applies its own seasonal factors to this series.

Aircraft Engines". To estimate PDE spending for aircraft, BEA uses the aircraft
shipments shown in that report, not the corresponding M-3 series. Note that the
CIR does not provide information on aircraft orders.

II-15
Looking ahead, orders for nondefense capital goods have remained
robust, on balance, and point to further near-term gains in equipment
outlays. Excluding aircraft and parts, the average level of nondefense
capital goods orders in January and February was up 5 percent from the
fourth quarter of last year.
In contrast to the recent gains in equipment outlays, spending for
nonresidential construction has been weak. Construction put-in-place,
which covers all nonresidential structures except oil and gas wells,
fell in both December and January, after posting solid gains last
autumn. Outlays for industrial and "other commercial" projects were
especially weak around year-end. However, both of these categories are
volatile on a monthly basis. The value of new construction contracts
has trended up since the middle of last year, suggesting that outlays in
this sector will rebound in coming months. The only areas where the
fundamenta s point to particular sluggishness are the office and hotel
sectors, where vacancy rates remain extremely high in many locales. In
addition, petroleum drilling activity could decline a bit further in the
near term, owing to the softness in oil prices since last summer.
Despite these pockets of weakness, surveys of capital spending
plans indicate that the outlook for business investment is fairly bright
this year. The most recent survey, conducted by McGraw-Hill between
late January and early March, indicates that nominal outlays are
expected to rise 8-3/4 percent in 1988. This gain is a bit larger than
those reported last fall by the McGraw-Hill and Commerce Department
surveys. All of the surveys taken since last fall show that

II-16
manufacturers plan substantial increases in spending this year,
reflecting, in part, pressures on capacity in a number of industries.
Housing Markets
Total housing starts rebounded 9 percent in February to a 1.49
million unit annual rate, with sizable increases in both the single- and
multifamily sectors. In addition, issuance of building permits firmed.
The pattern of activity in recent months may reflect, in part, some
fallout from the stock-market crash; however, winter weather and the
difficulties in seasonal adjustment also may have played a role in the
surprising December-January weakness.
The positive effect of the recent decline in interest rates appears
to be showing through, especially in the single-family market where
starts in February were slightly above the fourth-quarter average. The
reduction in rates since October has pushed the average annual mortgage
payment for a new home, priced on a quality-adjusted basis, back down
almost to the six-year low recorded last spring. In addition,
homebuilder views of the prospects for new house sales over the next six
months reportedly turned more optimistic in January and February, and
may have resulted in an increase in "speculative" single-family starts.
Despite the rise in February, multifamily housing starts were still
10 percent below the fourth quarter of last year. The low level of
activity in this sector stems largely from the combined effects of near
record-high vacancy rates and tax law changes, which lowered the rate of
return on investment in rental properties.

Over a longer horizon, a number of factors should work to support
construction in the multifamily market. Assuming that the household
formation and homeownership rates remain close to their 1983-87
averages, population trends suggest there will be a moderate demand for
rental units in the next few years., About two-fifths of existing rental
units were built prior to 1940; replacement of aging structures should
provide some impetus for construction. Furthermore, construction of
multifamily units for sale (condominiums) has remained near the 1986
pace, and absorption of newly built condominiums has been high. Taken
together, these factors are expected to bolster construction in the
multifamily sector over the next few years.
Federal Government
The President sent his FY1989 budget proposals to the Congress on
February 18. The budget, which is described in more detail in the
appendix, estimates that the FY1988 deficit will total $147 billion and
proposes a $130 billion deficit for FY1989. The 1989 budget assumes
that the deficit will be cut $46 billion by full implementation of last
fall's budget summit agreement, and it proposes an additional $9 billion
of deficit reductions.
In contrast, the Congressional Budget Office projects baseline
deficits of $157 billion and $176 billion for fiscal 1988 and 1989,
respectively. These estimates are higher than the administration's,
primarily because the CBO uses less favorable economic assumptions, and,
for 1989, it estimates that only $36 billion of the reductions in the
budget summit agreement have been implemented. In a separate analysis,

II-20
the CBO estimates that under its economic and technical assumptions the
President's budget proposals would result in a deficit of $161 billion
in 1988 and $165 billion in 1989.
Under the administration's economic and technical assumptions, the
President's proposals meet the $136 billion Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
deficit target for 1989. Under the CBO assumptions, the administration
would miss the mark--even with the $10 billion leeway--and Congress
would be required to propose at least $30 billion more of deficit
reductions in its Budget Resolution. However, the House Budget
Committee has used the administration's assumptions for its Budget
Resolution, and estimates a deficit of $134 billion in 1989 without
proposing new deficit reductions that go beyond last fall's summit
agreement. House floor action on this version of the Budget Resolution
is expected on March 23, and the Senate Budget Committee is required to
report a Budget Resolution by April 1. The need for a sequester will be
determined by the administration's budget estimates in July.
The federal deficit during the first five months of the current
fiscal year was $90 billion, down $5 billion from the corresponding
FY1987 total. Outlays have risen a moderate 3.6 percent during the
first five months of the current fiscal year. Significant declines from
year-earlier levels have been recorded in international affairs,
agriculture, and income security functions. These declines have been
offset by large increases in outlays for deposit insurance programs and
net interest, the effects of a somewhat larger COLA for Social Security,
than in 1987, and small increases in most other major categories. For
some of these categories, sizable year-over-year increases in net
outlays may emerge late in the current fiscal year, when year-earlier
outlays were depressed by a bunching of asset sales. After accounting

II-21
for a one-time shift in the military pay date from the end of FY1987 to
the start of FY1988, defense outlays are about unchanged from a year
earlier.
Revenues during the first five months of the current fiscal year
increased 6.1 percent from a year earlier. However, there is much
uncertainty about the trend of revenues, because the income tax filing
season, when the bulk of nonwithheld income taxes are collected, has
just started. Early data suggest a small year-to-year decline in
revenues from final income tax settlements. The final estimated tax
payment for 1987, which was due on January 15 and may be an indicator of
the final tax payments that are due on April 15, was down slightly from
a year earlier. Payments in the previous year had surged owing to
large realizations of capital gains, which were induced by tax reform.
On the other hand, tax refunds are running a bit above last year's
level. Daily Treasury data suggest that the final corporate payment on
the 1987 liability will be up about 10 percent, which is about in line
with recent increases in corporate estimated tax payments.
State and Local Government
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
rose rapidly in the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting a surge in
real construction spending. However, preliminary evidence suggests that
weakness in building has reemerged. Construction outlays fell more than
6 percent in January, with declines registered in almost every category.
In contrast, despite budget-cutting measures that were enacted in about
half the states in 1987, employment has continued to grow.
The recent weakness in state and local construction appears to be
out of line with many estimates of infrastructure needs. Recently, the
federally mandated National Council on Public Works Improvement

II-22
characterized the nation's roads, airports, mass transit, water supply,
and waste disposal facilities as "inadequate," and called for a doubling
of investment. Despite a surge in construction during the mid-1980s,
the stock of real public capital provided by state and local
governments, on a per capita basis, has been little changed on net
during the past 10 years.
The current slowing in construction spending likely reflects, in
part, efforts by many states to deal with erosion in their budgetary
positions. The states appear to have been experiencing fiscal
difficulties since 1986, when, in the aggregate, they reported nearly a
$3 billion deficit. In contrast, local governments, whose own-source
revenue comes largely from property tax receipts (which are fairly
stable), have enjoyed sound fiscal positions since 1981.
Prices
Inflation remained relatively moderate over the first two months of
this year, held down in part by declining energy prices and a relatively
small rise in food prices. The consumer price index for all urban
consumers rose 0.3 percent in January and 0.2 percent in February,
slightly below the pace in the second half of last year. Producer
prices of finished goods increased 0.4 percent in January, but then
dropped back 0.2 percent in February, mainly reflecting volatility in
the food component.
On balance, the CPI for food was little changed early this year,
and, like the CPI total, was a bit lower than its average pace over the
preceding six months. However, there were marked, though largely
offsetting, swings in the major food groupings. In February, retail
meat prices turned up, reflecting the pass-through of higher cattle
prices, while fresh vegetable prices dropped back, reversing part of a

late 1987 surge that was associated mainly with a temporary disruption
in lettuce supplies. Price increases for other food items, which
constitute about 70 percent of the CPI food total, picked up a bit in
January, but then moderated again last month. At the farm level, the
index for crude foods rose more than 2 percent in February, with large
increases for livestock and grains. Movements in farm prices have been
mixed since the February PPI pricing date.
Retail energy prices declined further in February, led by another
steep decline in gasoline prices. With world oil prices under downward
pressure into the second week of March, energy prices should remain a
moderating influence on the CPI over the near term.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.5 percent in January, but
then slowed to just 0.2 percent in February. Swings in apparel prices--
owing to the timing of discounts--have accounted for much of the
fluctuation in the index for consumer commodities excluding food and
energy. With the markdowns in February, prices of retail apparel goods
are now down 1-1/4 percent from their November level. The February
index for nonenergy services rose 0.4 percent, after a larger increase
in January. In February, particularly large increases were posted for
medical, educational, and local telephone services.
At the producer level, the PPI for finished consumer goods less
food and energy also slowed in February, after a pickup in January.
Capital equipment prices continued to rise at a moderate pace. Prices
of intermediate materials less food and energy, which rose rapidly
through January, advanced only 0.2 percent in February. This index was
held down by fairly widespread declines, most notably by a dropback for
a variety of copper products. The PPI for crude nonfood materials less
energy was up 0.8 percent in February. Since the February PPI pricing

contributions for social insurance significantly, and this is expected
to add around 1 percentage point, at an annual rate, to the overall rise
in hourly compensation in the first quarter.

APPENDIX
FEDERAL BUDGET DEVELOPMENTS1
On February 18, the administration submitted its budget proposals
for fiscal 1989. The broad outlines already had been shaped by the
summit agreement reached at the end of last year with the bipartisan
congressional leadership; they are reflected in the budget aggregates
shown in table 1. Although the summit called for roughly $30 billion of
deficit reduction for the current year, the administration projects this
year's deficit (third line) to be only slightly below last year's
$150 billion.' For 1989, the administration sees the deficit falling
further, to $130 billion, if the summit agreement and additional policy
proposals are fully implemented.
The budget plan appears to be roughly consistent with the FY1989
Gramm-Rudman deficit target. Under the amendments enacted last summer,
the deficit is not to exceed $136 billion. However, there is a $10 bil-
lion margin; sequestration would be avoided if OMB estimates this summer
and autumn show that the deficit will be less than $146 billion.
Another feature of the Gramm-Rudman revision was to exclude certain
one-time savings from the calculation. Embedded in the administration's
budget is about $10 billion of such savings, in the form of asset sales.
Therefore, adjusting for the asset sales, the deficit for Gramm-Rudman
purposes is in the neighborhood of $140 billion, somewhat above the
target but below the trigger point.
The lower panel of table 1 shows the policy assumptions incorpo-
rated in the 1989 budget. The summit agreement called for $46 billion
in deficit reducing actions for 1989. Thirty-eight billion dollars of
this deficit reduction is scored by the administration as already
implemented through the two omnibus budget bills enacted on December 22.
These included revenue increases, defense and nondefense discretionary
program cuts, and entitlement savings. The contributions from defense
and nondefense discretionary programs result from the carry-over effects
for FY1989 of the appropriations enacted for FY1988. The summit agree-
ment also included limits, or "caps," on defense and nondefense discre-
tionary budget authority yet to be enacted for 1989. These caps would
force spending $3 billion below this year's level after full adjustment
for inflation. Other additional summit measures, totaling $5 billion,
also remain to be authorized; these include asset sales of
$3-1/2 billion.

Division of Research and Statistics.

II-A-2
Beyond the summit agreement, the administration is proposing
further program reductions and some expansions. These proposals include
changes requested in preceding years, such as decreases in funding or
elimination of programs in the housing, surface transportation, and
energy areas, and cutbacks in funding for the Postal Service, the
District of Columbia government, and park land purchases. Increased
funding is requested for space and other science programs, air traffic
control, law enforcement and drug interdiction, as well as highly
targeted education initiatives associated with proposed welfare reform.
The slight decline in the projected deficit for 1988 and the down-
ward trajectory for deficits forecast for subsequent years are dependent
both on the administration's policy proposals and on their economic
assumptions. Table 2 compares the economic assumptions of the adminis-
tration and CBO. For the next two years, the administration has a more
optimistic view than CBO of real GNP growth and inflation. Their
longer-run projections reflect a more favorable assessment of potential
output growth and their view that inflation can continue to decelerate
even as the unemployment rate drifts down below 5-1/2 percent. The
administration also sees less of a boost to the CPI relative to the GNP
deflator. (The CPI is the inflation measure relevant for major indexed
outlay programs.) The administration anticipates more reduction in the
unemployment rate (lines 7 and 8) principally as a result of their
considerably stronger GNP projection; at the end of the projection
horizon, the administration has assumed an unemployment rate of
5-1/4 percent compared with the 5-3/4 percent for CBO.
Interest rate assumptions, shown on lines 9 and 10, are particu-
larly important for budget projections; a percentage point difference,
persisting for a year, now has nearly a $10 billion annual effect on
federal outlays. In part, the differences between the levels of
projected interest rates reflect the differences between inflation
projections; however, the implied ex post real Treasury bill rates
differ by about one percentage point in 1988 and 1989.
The administration's current services budget estimates, which
include the summit agreement in full but not the additional policy
initiatives, are shown on table 3, along with CBO's updated baseline2budget projection. The CBO estimates exclude $10 billion of the
summit accord that is not yet implemented. There are also a few other
conceptual differences between the current services and baseline defi-
nitions. Nevertheless, both the current services and baseline concepts
are designed to illustrate what would happen to the budget under laws
2. After release of the President's budget, CBO made minor technical
revisions to the baseline budget projections that had been released
earlier in their annual report. These revisions, which resulted largely
from bringing an accounting definition into line with OMB practice this
year, added about $4 billion and $2 billion to their FY1988 and FY1989
deficits, respectively.

and policies now in place if the economy performed reasonably well. The
figures diverge principally because of different technical estimating
methods as well as the different economic assumptions discussed above.
On March 10, the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis
of the President's budget, which included a reestimate of the budget
proposal using CBO's economic assumptions and technical estimating
methods (table 4). The technical differences are primarily on the
outlay side; in the near term, CBO anticipates higher spending than the
administration for deposit insurance, Medicare, and income security
programs. It also foresees lower proceeds from asset sales and loan
prepayments. The differences in economic assumptions dominate the
reestimates. Because lower real growth and higher inflation have
largely offsetting effects on receipts, the economic differences also
are concentrated on the outlay side of the budget where CBO expects
unemployment-sensitive programs and programs that are indexed for
inflation to be more costly. In addition, the larger size of deficits
estimated by CBO for the early years of the projection period con-
tributes, along with higher interest rates, to substantially higher debt
service costs in the 1990s.
Despite CBO's less optimistic economic assumptions, their rees-
timates of the President's budget also show gradually declining deficits
beyond 1989. Most of this decline is dependent on the new deficit-
reducing measures proposed by the President. As shown in table 3, CBO's
baseline budget deficit rises from the 1987 level of $150 billion to a
peak of $177 billion in FY1989 and does not fall back below the 1987
level until the last year of the projection horizon. The deficit in
1987 was depressed, however, by transitory effects of tax reform, which
reverse in 1988 and 1989; sizable outlay savings of a one-time nature
also occurred in 1987. If these transitory factors are removed, along
with the effects of the very slight further decline in the unemployment
rate that CBO projects (on an annual average basis), their
"standardized-employment" baseline deficit is estimated to have fallen
by about 0.9 percent of potential GNP between 1986 and 1987 and is
expected to fall further by a similar amount in 1988. Thereafter, it is
about flat as a percent of potential GNP through 1991.
Long-range budget deficit estimates by both the administration and
CBO are now considerably smaller than those that were being made a few
years ago. As recently as 1985, the baseline budget projections showed
deficits approaching $300 billion by 1990, or more than 5 percent of
GNP, despite some further cyclical expansion then built into GNP pro-
jections. In large part, the improved deficit picture results from
policy changes that have already taken place over the last several
years. These changes, however, have accompanied longer-run budget
trends, shown on the chart, that leave a substantial challenge to
further deficit reduction.

II-A-4
Despite actions that have slowed outlay growth recently, federal
spending as a portion of GNP--the solid line on the top panel--has
remained at historically high levels, averaging nearly 23 percent over
the last decade. Nondefense discretionary expenditures--outlays for
programs that are subject to annual appropriations or to loan obligation
limits imposed by appropriation acts--shouldered a substantial portion
of recent budget restraint. As shown in the middle panel, such spending
has fallen from nearly 6 percent of GNP in the seventies to less than
4 percent currently; in the CBO baseline it is about flat through 1990.
Meanwhile, the early-1970s downtrend in military spending was reversed
in the eighties; national defense outlays now equal 6-1/2 percent of
GNP, after having fallen to 4-3/4 percent in 1979. Current policy,
however, suggests defense outlays will turn down slightly relative to
GNP--from about 6 percent to 5-1/4 percent in the next decade as the
buildup yields to maintenance and replacement. The portion of outlays
devoted to interest on the national debt has about doubled in the past
10 years; it is now about 3 percent of GNP and its future course will
depend heavily on the balance between receipts and outlays in the rest
of the budget. In the CBO baseline, it edges up to 3.5 percent by 1990.
Entitlement and other mandatory spending dominates the budget,
accounting for nearly half of total outlays. By far the largest
component of entitlement spending is for social security and Medicare.
The aging of the population, benefit liberalizations, the effects of
inflation, and adverse cyclical experience drove entitlement spending up
to nearly 11 percent of GNP by the early 1980s. More recently, budget
restraint, particularly the 1983 social security and Medicare reforms,
and comparatively low inflation and unemployment have kept this category
from rising further relative to output. However, the growing proportion
of elderly in the population will continue to impose a floor for
entitlement spending under current laws and may intensify pressures for
program expansion. In CBO's projections, entitlement spending hovers
around 10-3/4 percent of GNP over the five-year projection horizon.
Trends on the receipts side of the budget also are noteworthy.
Social insurance taxes, which are devoted to paying for certain
entitlements and now account for more than a third of revenues, have
risen from less than 4 percent of GNP in 1963 to 7 percent last year.
Nevertheless, overall receipts as a percent of GNP have averaged about
19 percent for several decades, with relatively small fluctuations
around that figure. Many of the tax measures enacted over the last
quarter century have kept this ratio from growing despite an aggregate
elasticity of federal taxes with respect to income that tended to be
greater than one--especially before indexation of some features of the
personal income tax code in 1981. Thus, there appears to be a signifi-
cant tension between public preference as manifest in ta:: legislation
and the pressures--in part, from demographic sources--that sustain
spending.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have risen on balance since the February FOMC
meeting, the larger increases being registered in the bond markets.
Although the federal funds rate has remained around 6-1/2 percent and
the dollar has been relatively stable on exchange markets, the general
structure of interest rates has shifted upward as incoming information
has dispelled expectations of an early stall-out in economic expansion
and shifted the focus to inflation risks.
Most key short-term rates are up between an eighth and a quarter
percentage point. The Texas banking difficulties seem to have had
little effect on the money markets. In longer-term markets, both
Treasury and corporate bond yields have risen around 3/8 percentage
point. The rise in interest rates has not prevented stock prices from
registering sizable net gains over the intermeeting period; share prices
have now recovered roughly a third of the decline from their August 1987
highs to their autumn lows.
Reflecting the effects of earlier declines in market rates, inflows
to retail nontransactions instruments remained strong and M2 and M3 have
expanded rapidly; these aggregates are in the top halves of their annual
growth ranges. M1 continues to behave erratically, apparently
rebounding in March after being virtually unchanged in February.
Growth of the domestic debt aggregate looks to be running well
within the FOMC's monitoring range. Business borrowing has remained
sizable, with the pace of bond issuance rising in March; corporate

restructuring activity continues to result in massive net equity
retirements. Mortgage borrowing by households appears to have slowed a
little in recent months, but consumer installment credit likely grew
more rapidly. State and local bond offerings have picked up after a
slow January, while net issuance of Treasury debt is off about
seasonally in the current quarter.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
In February, M2 and M3 again expanded rapidly, increasing at 8-3/4
and 10-1/4 percent annual rates, respectively. Available data suggest
that this strength has persisted into March. Growth appears to have
been boosted, at least in part, by a reduction of opportunity costs of
holding monetary assets: deposit rates have yet to match the drop in
market rates since last fall.
In contrast to strength in the broader aggregates, M1 was virtually
unchanged in February; however, incoming data suggest renewed expansion
in March. All of the components of M1 decelerated in February.
Currency, which had been exceptionally strong after the October 19
crash, returned to a pace of expansion more in line with the underlying
growth of spending. Demand deposits fell last month, more than
reversing January's increase; the weakness, on balance, in this
component over the post-crash period has been widespread by size and
type of depository institution. OCD growth slowed to a 7-3/4 percent
annual rate in February, after a 19 percent surge in January.
Among the nontransactions components of M2, patterns of growth have
been shaped by the still large rate advantage of small time accounts

over more liquid interest-bearing deposits. Small time accounts have
expanded at a double-digit pace each month since last September; by
contrast, the sum of savings, MMDAs and OCDs has grown weakly in the
first quarter after contracting inthe fourth quarter.
M2 growth also has been bolstered by sizable inflows to retail-type
money market mutual funds. Yields on shares of these funds have been
relatively attractive compared with competing bank deposits. Investors
also may be continuing to favor money market funds over bond and stock
mutual funds. Net inflows to bond and equity funds strengthened
somewhat in January (latest available) but remained well below the pace
evident prior to the plunge in stock prices last October, and reports
indicate that transfers into money market funds from bond and equity
funds in the same family group continued in early 1988.
M3 was boosted in February by its non-M2 component as well as by
strong M2 growth; however, the non-M2 component appears to be weakening
in March. Inflows to institution-only MMMFs continued strong in
February, reflecting the very attractive yields that were available on
these instruments relative to market alternatives, but have shown signs
of reversing in March. Growth of large time deposits has weakened in
March after being very strong in February. Heavy issuance in February
evidently helped fund relatively strong asset expansion at both
commercial banks and thrifts. To some extent, though, CD issuance by
banks also constituted a substitution for funds previously obtained by
domestic offices from offshore branches; the decline of $6 billion in
these funds in February may be linked indirectly to a shifting of

investments by foreign central banks from the Eurodollar market to U.S.
Treasury securities.
The pickup in bank credit growth in February reflected acquisitions
for portfolio of mortgage-backed securities as well as stronger loan
demand. Security loans--comprising mostly credit extended to brokers
and dealers--soared for the second straight month and have returned
almost to pre-crash levels. Among other loan categories, credit demands
appear to have been most robust in the real estate and investment areas;
business lending was weak at U.S. banking offices. Data available
through early March suggest a slowing of growth of bank credit at large
banks, reflecting runoffs of holdings of U.S. Treasuries and declines in
security loans; however, real estate and consumer lending remain
relatively strong.
Business Finance
Business borrowing has remained sizable in the first quarter of
1988, owing partly to greater merger and buyout activity. Renewed
interest in corporate acquisitions may have been stimulated to some
extent by the lower stock prices of potential targets and the improved
liquidity of a number of prospective acquirers; but, in addition, the
lower dollar has encouraged foreign purchasers. Merger and buyout
deals, along with continuing share repurchases, have boosted net share
retirements to an estimated $100 billion annual rate in the first
quarter--a level not seen since the fourth quarter of 1986.
Growth of the sum of business loans and nonfinancial commercial
paper appears to have picked up in early March after some slowing in

III-8
February. Despite increased merger financing, business loans at U.S.
banks (including foreign branches) slowed to a 6-1/2 percent rate of
growth in February, and partial data suggest a further slowing at large
banks in March. By contrast, nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding
has been strong thus far in March after contracting slightly in
February.
The overall pace of securities issuance by nonfinancial businesses
changed little in February but appears to have picked up in March. In
the bond market, yields have moved up over the intermeeting period, in
line with advances on comparable Treasuries, but remain lower than they
were over most of the past year. The volume of issues with longer
maturities, in particular, has responded to the relatively low rates.
Activity in the junk bond market also has increased, with spreads over
higher-grade issues narrowing a bit and issuance for purposes of
corporate restructuring picking up.
Gross issuance of new shares by nonfinancial corporations has
remained sluggish since the market crash last October. Moreover, while
equity issuance by financial institutions has been expanding briskly,
the bulk of the activity has been in shares of new closed-end mutual
funds set up to invest in U.S. and foreign government and corporate
bonds.
The failure of nonfinancial equity offerings to rebound comes
despite a strong rise in stock prices since early December, particularly
in the Amex and NASDAQ indexes; however, prices of utility stocks have
lagged because of disappointing rate increases granted by state

III-9
regulators. On the financial side, S&L share prices have been depressed
by adverse publicity regarding the need for further action to bolster
FSLIC's reserves. In the last couple of weeks, some indexes of bank
stock prices have slipped, perhaps reflecting adverse publicity about
Texas banking; while the federal safety net has been extended to the
creditors of the banking affiliates of First RepublicBank Corporation,
shareholders remain exposed.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The combined deficit of the federal government is expected to total
about $34 billion in the first quarter of calendar 1988, down from $80
billion in the fourth quarter of 1987. Net cash borrowing from the
public is expected to be about $41 billion this quarter, most of which
is accounted for by issuance of marketable coupon securities, although
these have been scaled back a bit recently. Exchange market
intervention earlier this year and efforts to extend maturities of
existing holdings have continued to bolster requests by foreign official
institutions for noncompetitive "add-ons" to Treasury auctions. These
add-ons, which have totaled $14 billion thus far in 1988 as compared
with $30.3 billion for all of 1987, have enabled the Treasury to cut
back the volume of long-term bill and coupon issues being sold
competitively to the general public. Two shorter-term coupon issues
that settle at the end of this month will involve paydowns, apart from
1. The Treasury is expected to receive only $532 million of cash from
the sale of nonmarketable foreign series bonds to the Mexican
government. The 20-year zero-coupon bonds issued will have a total face
value of about $2.6 billion.

Borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies is projected to
slow significantly in the first quarter of 1988 from its rapid pace in
the previous quarter. Most of the slowdown is attributable to the
housing-related agencies--the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal
National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation. Debt retirement by the Farm Credit Banks appears to be
continuing at the more moderate rate established in the last quarter of
1987; loan demand at these institutions may not be weakening as much as
earlier, given the improvement in the farm economy and the protection
now afforded borrowers on the value of their stock investments in system
units. This protection was part of legislation providing for federal
assistance to the Farm Credit System, which was passed late last year.
Since then, interest rates on its issues have declined relative to
yields on Treasury securities. At the system's most recent offering in
late February, the spread of the yield on the six-month issue over the
six-month Treasury bill was 47 basis points, the smallest in 13 months.
Municipal Securities Markets
Tax-exempt revenue bond yields have risen around 30 basis points in
recent weeks as new-issue volumes have been greater than had been
expected. Gross offerings of municipal securities were boosted in
February by bonds issued to finance transportation projects. Total tax-
exempt issuance for March is expected to increase further as the volume
of refundings has picked up to a pace well above that recorded in the

III-12
second half of 1987, although remaining far below the average monthly
volume in the years 1984 to 1986.

f--forecast.
In general, the ratios of yields on tax-exempts to yields on
taxables at both long and short maturities have been higher subsequent
to passage of tax reform legislation in 1986, which lowered marginal tax
rates and thereby reduced the tax benefits from owning tax-exempt
securities. For instruments of one-year maturity, which are perceived
to have relatively little default risk, the ratio of prime-grade tax-
exempts to Treasuries rose from less than 56 percent in 1983-84 (the
first two years of the current expansion) to more than 66 percent in
1987. At longer maturities, changes in ratios of tax-exempt to taxable
yields have been smaller and the net effects of tax reform less clear.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage interest rates have changed little since the February FOMC
meeting. In the primary market, the average contract rate on new

III-13
commitments for 30-year, fixed-rate conventional home mortgages is about
unchanged, while the average initial rate quoted on one-year adjustable-
rate mortgages (ARMs) indexed to the one-year, constant maturity
Treasury yield has declined 15 basis points. On balance, since last
October, the fixed-rate loan rate is down more than 1-1/2 percentage
points, and the ARM rate has fallen about a point.
Through January, however, there was no obvious response to the
decline in mortgage interest rates. Consistent with movements in home
sales and construction, the volume of mortgage loans closed at FSLIC-
insured institutions declined in January to a seasonally adjusted $17.4
billion, the lowest level since September 1985. Both refinancings and
purchase loans were down; moreover, new commitments to originate
mortgages at thrifts declined for the fourth consecutive month to a
seasonally adjusted $18.6 billion.2
Data on lending activity by thrifts in February are not yet
available, but total applications for FHA-insured mortgages at all
lenders were up nearly 30 percent from the modest January level. Some
caution is appropriate in interpreting these data, because it is quite
possible that the FHA activity could have reflected some shifting back
toward fixed-rate lending rather than a pickup in overall mortgage debt
formation. Between early December and early February, the ARM share of
conventional loan originations already had fallen from 69 percent to 63
percent.
2. The proportion of mortgages closed at FSLIC-insured thrifts that
were for refinancing fell to 19 percent, roughly in line with the
average share for the latter half of 1987 and well below the peak share
of 40 percent registered last March.

As had been the case in prior months, thrift activity in the
secondary mortgage market in January reflected the preference of these
institutions for retaining the ARMs they originate. Sales of mortgages
by FSLIC-insured thrifts dropped to $5.8 billion, the lowest monthly
level since November 1984. Net acquisitions of mortgage-related assets
also declined in January to $4.7 billion, as holdings of pass-through
securities fell for the first time since mid-1986. ARMs again accounted
for all of the increase in unsecuritized mortgages.
The marketwide slowdown in the pace of fixed-rate lending in late
1987 affected the volume of new mortgage pass-through securities early
this year. Issuance of federally related mortgage-backed pass-throughs
declined in January to a seasonally adjusted $8.3 billion, while
preliminary data for February suggest only a slight pickup to $9.3
billion, which was well below the average monthly pace registered in
1987. In contrast, offerings of derivative mortgage securities have
rebounded to a monthly pace of about $5 billion. Notable among recent
offerings was a $100 million FNMA issue with four tranches. This ninth
offering by FNMA through a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit
(REMIC) raised Fannie Mae's total REMIC issuance to about $3 billion.
Although it is currently authorized to issue up to $15 billion in
REMICs, FNMA has petitioned HUD for unlimited issuing authority.
Freddie Mac, meanwhile, made its initial foray into the REMIC market,
selling two issues of about $400 million each on successive days in late
February.

Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at a 10-1/2 percent
annual rate in January, up from the 8 percent pace recorded in December
and on average over the second half of last year. The pickup in growth
was wholly attributable to a surge in the sizable "other" component
after a December decline, a turnabout that may only reflect instability
in the pronounced seasonal patterns around Christmas. Growth in
automobile and revolving (credit card) debt slowed a bit from December,
although the latter maintained its position as the strongest component
of installment credit since mid-1987.
The rebound in growth of revolving credit since last June, after
nine months of sluggish expansion, likely is related in part to the
slowdown in growth of loans taken down under home equity lines of
credit. Previously reported survey results have indicated that banks
became less aggressive in marketing home equity lines last summer and
that the most common initial use of home equity lines is to repay
outstanding debts, especially credit card balances. Other households
may simply have used available liquid assets to repay consumer loans on
which interest payments were no longer fully tax deductible, and such
activity also seems likely to have diminished over time.
The household sector apparently experienced some increase in debt
servicing problems during the fourth quarter. Delinquency rates on
mortgage and consumer loans and the number of personal bankruptcies all
rose fairly sharply after previous uptrends appeared to have flattened
out earlier last year. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association,

home mortgages past due 60 days or more jumped to 1.71 percent, erasing

delinquent for 30 days or more, climbed to 2.56 percent in the quarter
after holding for several quarters near the midpoint of its 13-year
range of 1.80 to 2.80 percent. The major automobile finance companies
reported no change in the car-loan delinquency rate in the fourth
quarter, but experienced an increase in January to 2.14 percent.
Personal bankruptcies were up again in the fourth quarter and rose 10
percent for 1987 as a whole.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The dollar has eased a net 3/4 percent on a weighted-average basis
against the other G-10 currencies since the last FOMC meeting, as shown
in the upper panel of Chart 1. The dollar's decline principally
reflected a nearly 4 percent fall against sterling and a 1-1/2 percent
drop against the Canadian dollar and the yen, shown in the lower panel.
In terms of the mark and other EMS currencies, the dollar was little
changed on balance.
During the intermeeting period, the dollar primarily reacted to
changes in the outlook for U.S. external adjustment. A sharp apprecia-
tion early in the period, in response to better than expected U.S. trade
data for December, was subsequently eroded as data began to signal
stronger U.S. demand. These concerns, in turn, subsided somewhat fol-
lowing the release in mid-March of another month of favorable trade
data.
All three currencies -- sterling, the Canadian dollar, and the
yen -- benefited from the robust performance of their economies and, in
the case of sterling and the Canadian dollar, from statements by
officials indicating that steps would be taken, if necessary, to counter
inflationary pressures. Previously, Bank of Canada Governor Crow
emphasized that the central bank's objective, rather than merely a low
rate of inflation, is a steady price level. The Bank of England raised
its money market intervention rates 1/2 percentage point in early
February and further tightening was expected.

.U.K. officials stressed that interest rates
would be used to counter inflationary pressures and would not be reduced
to halt sterling's rise. As upward pressure on sterling persisted, the
Bank of England
cut its money market inter-
vention rates by 1/2 percentage point to 8-3/8 percent. In attempting
to reconcile these actions with previously stated policy objectives,
Prime Minister Thatcher cited recent U.K. monetary data showing modest
increases in the broader aggregates and suggested that the decline in
official rates was not inconsistent with a firm monetary stance given
sterling's appreciation.

IV-4
Short-term interest differentials favoring dollar-denominated
assets were little changed on average during the intermeeting period.
Interest rates on U.S. CDs were flat, and comparable interest rates in
Japan and Germany showed little change. Three-month interbank rates in
the United Kingdom fell 60 basis points, but interest rates were up
sharply in France and Italy. For longer maturities, interest differen-
tials between dollar and yen assets were little changed, while interest
rates on dollar assets became relatively more attractive vis-a-vis rates
on sterling and mark assets. Long-term interest differentials favoring
the Canadian dollar widened during the intermeeting period.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Net sales of U.S. corporate stocks by foreigners, which totaled
$9.4 billion in the two months after the October crash, were virtually
zero in January. (See line 2b of the Summary Table of U.S. International
Transactions.) For 1987 as a whole, record net purchases in the first
three quarters of the year were followed by large sales in the fourth
quarter, resulting in a net inflow for the year only slightly below the
1986 level of $18 billion. Net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds by
foreigners were also small, on a payments basis, in January (line 2a),
but a pickup in new Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations in January and
February suggests increased purchases as the first quarter progresses.

After large net purchases in November, private foreigners made small net
sales of U.S. Treasury securities in both December and January (line 3).
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities continued strong, reaching
$920 million in January. (See line 2c.) This total was entirely
accounted for by purchases of foreign bonds, some of which were issued
directly in the United States. U.S. residents continued to sell foreign
equities net in January, as they had during the fourth quarter of 1987.
Official reserves held in the United States showed a further large
increase of $6.8 billion in January (line 4),
.Substantial increases
in official reserves held in the Unites States were registered by the G-
10 countries, .Preliminary information
from the FRBNY indicates further sizable increases in G-10 official
holdings in the United States in February and early March, particularly
in the form of Treasury bonds and notes.
.The reserves of OPEC countries in
the United States dropped significantly again in January ($1.1 billion).
After declining a total of $8.8 billion in 1987, total OPEC reserves in
the United States stood at $27.4 billion at the end of January, down
almost $40 billion from their peak in 1982.
Banks reported that net outflows in January were $4.6 billion (line
1). Preliminary data for February, covering transactions with own for-
eign offices, show a continued outflow at least as high. (See line 1

of the International Banking Data table.) One factor in these outflows
was probably the rapid growth of core deposits relative to bank credit
in these two months. Another factor may have been the shift of large
amounts out of the Euromarkets into U.S. Treasury securities by official
monetary authorities.
The recently released data for direct investment in the fourth
quarter show very large flows in both directions (lines 6 and 7). For
the year, inflows were a record $40.6 billion, up over $15 billion from
both 1986 and the previous record year of 1984. A large share of the
total inflow came from the United Kingdom ($19.0 billion) and Japan
($7.4 billion); the rest of Western Europe accounted for an additional
$11 billion and Canada was next with $1.4 billion. Inflows from the
United Kingdom have been strong in recent years ($7.8 billion in 1986),
frequently being linked to large acquisitions (e.g., the British Petro-
leum purchase of 45 percent of Sohio in 1987 for $7.6 billion). Outflows
in 1987 at $38.2 billion approached the level of inflows. However, this
figure was inflated by $11 billion in capital gains associated with the
depreciation of the dollar. The largest share of the direct investment
outflow (including capital gains) went to Western Europe ($19.7
billion), with $6 billion going to the United Kingdom. Sizable outflows
also went to Canada ($6.6 billion) and to finance affiliates in the
Netherlands Antilles ($3.1 billion).
U.S. Merchandise Trade
Last week the Commerce Department released U.S. merchandise trade
figures for January. The not-seasonally-adjusted deficit, shown in

IV-9
column 8 in the summary table on the next page, was slightly larger than
that recorded in December. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the staff
estimates a slight improvement in the trade position (column 7). All of
the seasonal factors for merchandise exports and imports are currently
being revised; new seasonally adjusted data (including historical
figures) will be released on a regular basis beginning in June when data
for the month of April become available.
Merchandise exports in January were 7 percent below the strong
December level and about equal to the average rate of exports in the
fourth quarter. The decline in January was largely in manufactured
goods and was broadly spread among industrial supplies, capital goods,
automotive products, and undocumented shipments to Canada. Domestic
demand continued to advance in major U.S. trading partners through the
first quarter, though at a reduced pace compared with the fourth quarter
of 1987. In recent quarters, about one-fourth of U.S. nonagricultural
exports were shipped to Canada, another fourth to countries in Western
Europe, 10 percent each to Japan and to the Asian NICs, 6 percent to
Mexico, and the remaining 25 percent largely to other countries in Latin
America and Asia. Much of the increase in nonagricultural exports to
the Asian NICs since last October was due to nonmonetary gold shipments
to Taiwan; in November, December, and January, U.S. gold exports to
Taiwan totaled $807 million, compared with less than $1 million during
the first 10 months of 1987.
Agricultural exports in January were at rates higher than in either
December or the fourth quarter. Much of the strength is attributed to

large shipments of wheat and feedgrains to the Soviet Union and China.
Soviet destinations accounted for 40 percent of January wheat shipments,
and China another 8 percent. Wheat shipped to these two countries was
sold under Export Enhancement Programs, which means that prices paid
were well below the world price for wheat. Purchases already agreed to
by the Soviet Union and China should raise the level of shipments
through May.
The value of imports in January was well below rates recorded in
either December or the fourth quarter as a whole. There were declines
in imports of capital goods and industrial supplies in January from
unexpectedly strong rates during the fourth quarter; there were also
equally strong declines in imports of consumer goods and automotive
products. Imports of passenger cars from Asia and Europe, which had
declined in the fourth quarter (on a seasonally adjusted basis), fell
further in January.
The value of oil imports in January was about the same as in
December. (See the table below.) A 9 percent increase in volume was
offset by a drop in the average price of imported oil by nearly $1.00
per barrel. The volume of oil imports rose in January as stock
drawdowns were offset by higher consumption; weekly data suggest that

U.S. Current Account in 1987-Q4 and Year 1987.
1987-Q4. The U.S. current account deficit decreased to $156 bil-
lion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1987 from $174 billion
(revised) in the third quarter. (See the table below.) A sharp in-
crease in capital gains (line 6) on the book value of U.S. direct in-
vestments abroad (due to the decline in the value of the dollar)
accounted for virtually all of the reduction in the current account
deficit. Also contributing to the reduction in the deficit were an

increase in net income receipts from other direct investments (line 7)
and a slightly smaller trade deficit (line 1). On the other hand, there
were increased net payments to foreigners in a variety of areas. Net
portfolio income payments rose (line 8), reflecting, in part, growing
U.S. liabilities to foreigners. Also, military sales declined further
in the fourth quarter; military exports in the second half of 1987 were
well below first-half levels reflecting completion during the first half
of major scheduled deliveries of equipment. Unilateral transfers in-
creased sharply as a country in the Middle East drew, in the fourth
quarter, nearly all of the the U.S. Government grant funds provided for
the fiscal year begun in October.
Year 1987. The U.S. current account was in deficit by $160.7
billion in 1987, compared with a deficit of $141.4 billion in 1986. The
merchandise trade deficit rose to $159.2 billion in 1987 from $144.3
billion in 1986 (the value of imports rose more than that of exports).
Worsening positions in net portfolio income payments and miscellaneous
service transactions were partly offset by increased receipts from
direct investments abroad (some of this was capital gains, but most of
it was other earnings) and a reduced amount of unilateral transfers
during the year.
U.S. bank lending to foreigners. The (nominal) dollar value of
U.S.-chartered banks' claims on foreigners decreased $7.6 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1987. The foreign exchange value of the dollar in
terms of other G-10 currencies fell on average 13.3 percent during the
period. After adjustment for the effect of exchange rate changes on

IV-14
nondollar claims, total claims on foreigners are estimated to have
declined by about $21 billion in the fourth quarter, and by about $30
billion for 1987 as a whole.

Total U.S. bank claims on foreigners began their recent decline
during 1985. In the period from the end of 1984 to the end of 1987,
total claims have fallen by approximately $20 billion in nominal terms,
and by approximately $70 billion after adjustment for exchange rate
effects. Both U.S. and foreign banks have shifted lending toward

IV-15
borrowers from the G-10 countries. U.S. banks, however, have more than
offset nominal increases in loans to these borrowers by reducing claims
on virtually all other standard country groupings of borrowers.
The value of claims on non-OPEC developing countries fell by $600
million in the fourth quarter. This represented declines in claims on
most countries in that group, with the notable exceptions of Argentina
and Taiwan. Argentina made a $500 million drawing on its 1987 new money
package during the quarter. This increased U.S. bank claims on that
country by approximately $100 million. Claims on Taiwan increased by
over $2 billion in the fourth quarter, as residents borrowed U.S. dol-
lars and engaged in other financial transactions in anticipation of
continued domestic currency appreciation.
Claims on most of the non-OPEC developing countries fell during
1987 as a whole. The largest percentage declines were concentrated on
countries with outstanding loans from U.S. chartered banks valued at
under $5 billion. Loans to eight of these countries were reduced by
over 20 percent. (These countries were: Zaire, Israel, Egypt, Malaysia,
South Korea, Peru, (Mainland) China, and Thailand.) Taiwan and India
were the only non-OPEC developing countries to increase their (gross)
borrowing from U.S. banks.
Recent data suggest that indicative prices for loans to most of
the heavily indebted developing countries have fallen somewhat compared
with estimates available prior to the last FOMC meeting. The largest
decline has been in prices of loans to Argentina, which fell approxi-
mately 10 percent over the period.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries slowed
somewhat on average in the fourth quarter from its very strong third-
quarter pace, although in Canada the pace of GDP growth accelerated. In
Japan, growth in domestic demand accelerated in the fourth quarter while
a sharp drop in net exports drew down overall GNP growth. Growth in
fourth-quarter real GNP in the United Kingdom was below the excep-
tionally high third quarter rate but consumption and fixed investment
spending remained strong, while in Germany and France, growth of GNP
slowed to about half the third-quarter rate. Recent indicators for
Germany suggest that growth in the first quarter of 1988 has continued
at about the moderate pace of the fourth quarter, while

IV-20
Japanese data for the first quarter indicate continued strong expansion.
Inflation remains low in most of the foreign G-7 economies and, in early
1988, increases in the level of consumer prices from a year ago either
slowed or were unchanged. Data available so far in 1988 indicate little
change in the nominal external imbalances of several major foreign
economies.
New government budget projections were announced recently in
Germany and the United Kingdom. The German budget implies a widening of
the federal deficit from 1-1/4 percent of GNP in 1987 to about 2 percent
of GNP in 1988. In the United Kingdom, unexpectedly strong GDP growth
and sharply falling unemployment in FY 1987 (April through March) al-
lowed the government to announce simultaneously significant reductions
in tax rates and a projected budget surplus of more than 1/2 percent of
GDP in FY 1988, inclusive of revenues from privatization equal to about
1 percent of GDP.
Individual country notes. In Japan, the strong growth of real
economic activity that emerged in the third quarter continued in the
fourth quarter and into early 1988. Real GNP in the fourth quarter
expanded at a 7 percent rate (s.a.a.r.) compared with the exceptionally
robust 8.4 percent rate of the third quarter. Domestic demand grew 10.1
percent, up from 7.7 percent in the third quarter, based on strength in
investment spending. Net exports made a negative contribution to
growth, as exports declined 6.7 percent and imports grew 9.7 percent.
On a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis, real GNP grew 5.3 per-
cent, with domestic demand contributing 6.5 percentage points and net

IV-21
exports withdrawing 1.2 percentage points. In January, industrial
production (s.a.) increased 0.6 percent and retail sales (s.a.) rose 3.1
percent. While the unemployment rate (s.a.) edged up to 2.7 percent in
January from 2.6 percent in December and housing starts (s.a.) fell in
December and January from their recent rapid pace, the index of leading
indicators pointed to continuing expansion over the first half of 1988.
Consumer price inflation remains low in Japan, with prices
unchanged on balance since mid-1987. The all-commodities index of
wholesale prices (n.s.a.) declined in each of the past four months.
Lower rates on public utilities and lower prices of domestically
produced and consumed goods contributed to the declines.
Japan's trade surplus (s.a.) widened on average in dollar terms in
the first two months of 1988 relative to the fourth quarter. However,
the declining trend in the real trade surplus continued as average
growth in import volume in January and February of 21 percent from a
year ago outpaced growth in export volume of 2 percent.
In Germany, real GNP growth slowed to 2.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
fourth quarter of 1987 from 5.7 percent in the third quarter. Although
domestic demand increased sharply, inventory accumulation accounted for
most of this growth. Private consumption grew 2.2 percent and construc-
tion rose 6 percent, but government outlays and expenditures on machin-
ery and equipment fell. Net exports also declined. Real GNP in the
fourth quarter of 1987 was 2.4 percent above the year-earlier level,
with domestic demand contributing 3.1 percentage points and net exports
withdrawing 0.7 percentage points. In January, industrial production

IV-22
(s.a.) increased 2 percent after a small increase in December. The
unemployment rate (s.a.) in February was unchanged from January at 8.7
percent, a reduction from the 1987 year-end rates largely as a conse-
quence of revisions in the labor force data. The volume of total new
manufacturing orders rose in January from the monthly average of the
fourth quarter, after four consecutive monthly declines. Domestic
orders accounted for all of the increase. Capacity utilization (for all
sectors except foodstuffs, beverages and chemicals) rose in the fourth
quarter of 1987 to 85 percent, an increase of 0.5 percent from the third
quarter.
Consumer prices increased slightly in February, rising 1.1 percent
from a year ago. Producer prices in January were only 0.1 percent above
year-earlier levels, and import prices were 1 percent below year-earlier
levels.
The trade surplus (s.a.) increased slightly in December, bringing
the trade surplus for 1987 as a whole to $65.8 billion, compared with
$52.5 billion in 1986. The current account surplus in 1987 was $44.7
billion, compared with $38.5 billion in 1986. In 1987, export volume
rose 2.3 percent on average and import volume rose 5 percent.
Monetary growth in Germany remains rapid. On average in January
and February, German M3 grew at an annualized rate of 8-1/4 percent
(s.a.) from the target base period of 1987 Q4.
The German cabinet has approved a draft 1990 tax reform bill which
is expected to be considered in Parliament by the end of April. The
draft proposal includes the last part of a three-stage tax reduction

IV-23
that began in 1986. The bill is expected to reduce the tax burden by a
net DM20.6 billion or 0.9 percent of projected nominal GNP in 1990. The
enforcement of a 10 percent withholding tax on interest, scheduled as
part of the 1989 tax adjustments, has been a contentious issue. Various
interest groups are currently seeking exemptions; and in early March,
religious and non-profit organizations were granted exemptions.
Economic activity in France slowed in the fourth quarter from the
rapid pace of the two previous quarters. Real GDP rose nearly 1.6 per-
cent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter, after growing by more than four
percent in the second and third quarters. Exports and investment spend-
ing were the major sources of growth in the fourth quarter. President
Mitterrand has yet to announce his candidacy for the April 24 election,
but he is expected to run, and in several polls he is ahead of Prime
Minister Chirac and former Prime Minister Barre, the two other leading
candidates.
Real GDP in the United Kingdom expanded 2.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
the fourth quarter, as calculated by the average of the output, expendi-
ture, and income measures. This represents a substantial slowdown from
the 7.7 percent pace of the previous quarter. Consumption and fixed
investment spending remained major sources of strength while the fourth-
quarter GDP growth rate was held down by a drop-off of the rate of
inventory accumulation from the very rapid pace of previous quarters.
Industrial production (s.a.) declined 0.6 percent in January, but
remained 4.4 percent above its year-earlier level. The unemployment
rate (s.a.) fell to 9.1 percent in February, the 20th consecutive

IV-24
monthly decline and the lowest monthly unemployment rate since 1981.
Average earnings continue to rise much more rapidly than consumer
prices. In January, the 12-month rate of consumer price inflation was
3.3 percent, while average earnings increased at an 8.7 percent rate.
On March 15, the British government announced its budget for the
fiscal year beginning in April. Its most notable feature was a reduc-
tion in tax rates amounting to nearly 1 percent of GDP, consisting al-
most entirely of personal income tax reductions. Despite these tax
reductions, continued strong real growth is expected to keep the budget
(inclusive of revenues from privatization) in surplus for the second
consecutive year. The target range for MO was lowered by 1 percentage
point to 1 to 5 percent. As of February, the 12-month growth rate of MO
was 5.4 percent. However, interest rates, rather than monetary aggre-
gate growth, are currently the focus of monetary policy.
Economic growth in Canada remains rapid. Real GDP grew 6.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter, as consumer spending and investment
outlays continued to surge. Additions to private sector inventories
made a significant contribution to growth. The unemployment rate
dropped substantially in February to 7.8 percent, from 8.1 percent
during the two previous months. The downward trend in consumer price
inflation that started in mid-1987 continued in January.
Leaders of the European Community met in February to discuss reform
of EC finances and of the Common Agricultural Policy. Agreement was
reached to cap annual budget outlays and restructure budget contribu-
tions, to restrain agricultural spending and institute overproduction

IV-25
penalties, and to increase structural aid to the poorest member
countries.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
At the end of February, Brazil reached a preliminary agreement with
its bank advisory committee on key elements of a financing and
rescheduling package. The February 26 auction of Mexican bonds, backed
by U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds, will enable Mexico to reduce its
outstanding debt by $1.1 billion and achieve net savings in external
interest payments of about $65 million per year for 20 years. The
Argentine economic program is moving ahead with the disbursement of a
U.S. Treasury bridge loan and IMF approval of additional drawings under
the stand-by arrangement and from the Compensatory Financing Facility.
Individual Country Notes. Brazil paid $356 million from its own
reserves as a partial payment of January 1988 interest at the beginning
of February. On February 28, Brazil and the Bank Advisory Committee
(BAC) announced a preliminary agreement on key elements of a financing
package providing Brazil with $5.8 billion in new loans at a spread of
13/16 percent over LIBOR, covering interest arrears for 1987 and net new
money needs for 1988 and the first half of 1989. Also, Brazil was, in
effect, guaranteed $300-600 million in new short-term credit lines.
Brazil made additional interest payments of $520 million on March 3 and
$118 million on March 17, bringing total interest payments for interest
due in the January-February period to $994 million; about $70 million
remains to be paid for those two months. Brazil has announced its
intention to make further interest payments as negotiations with the

IV-26
banks progress, but has emphasized its need for a bridge loan from the
banks to cover the $1.8 billion in interest payments coming due in
April, May and June.
The trade surplus for February was $858 million--a very strong
performance since February is generally a seasonally weak month.
Inflation accelerated to an 18 percent monthly rate in February; prelim-
inary survey data indicate that inflation may slow to around 16 percent
in March. Finance Minister Nobrega was rebuffed in his plans to control
the public sector wage bill, and it remains unclear what steps will be
taken to reduce the large operational fiscal deficit. The government
revised downward its estimate for GDP growth in 1987 to 2.9 percent.
Strong performance in the agricultural sector was the most important
contributor to growth.
The February 26 auction of new Mexican bonds to retire public sec-
tor debt to banks at a discount will enable Mexico to achieve a net
reduction of $1.1 billion in outstanding debt and net savings in exter-
nal interest payments of about $65 million per year for 20 years, based
on the current LIBOR. The average discount in the auction was 30.23
percent. Mexico will issue $2.6 billion in new bonds and expects to pay
about $532 million to buy U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds that will
serve as collateral for principal payments on the new Mexican bonds.
The effects of Mexico's anti-inflation program are beginning to be
seen. The CPI, which rose by 15.5 percent in January, rose by 8.3 per-
cent in February, and is expected to increase at a lower rate in March.
After being held almost unchanged for six weeks, the controlled peso
price of the dollar was raised by 2.7 percent during February.

IV-27
However, the government announced February 29 that this rate would not
be changed during March, that the freeze on public sector prices that
was to have ended March 1 would continue for another month, and that
price increases for private secto goods subject to price control would
not be authorized this month. At the same time, the private sector
agreed to make efforts not to raise prices of goods not subject to con-
trol, and organized labor accepted a 3 percent wage increase for March,
abandoning its demand for a 10 percent raise. These moves brought about
an inflow of funds from abroad and an appreciation of the free peso
exchange rate to within 7/10 of 1 percent of the controlled rate. As
the availability of funds increased, interest rates fell sharply. At
the March 15 auction, the effective annual yield on 28-day Treasury
bills was 136 percent, compared with 320 percent at the auction of
February 23.
In late February, Argentina received the first $390 million drawing
from a $550 million U.S. Treasury bridge loan that will bridge to future
IMF and World Bank disbursements. The balance was disbursed March 15.
On March 18 the IMF approved an SDR 165.5 million drawing under the
stand-by arrangement and an SDR 130 million CFF drawing.
After declining from the 1987 peak rate of 19.5 percent in October
to 3.4 percent in December, the monthly CPI inflation rate rose to 9.1
percent in January and 10.4 percent in February. The spread between the
commercial and financial exchange rates has dropped from 38 percent on
March 1 to 25.4 percent on March 18. The current account deficit in
1987 is estimated at $4.3 billion, compared with a deficit of $2.8 bil-
lion in 1986. Exports declined by about 10 percent in 1987, due in part

IV-28
to low commodity prices and lower crop yields as a result of poor
weather. Commodity prices are now substantially above last year's
levels, and prospects for harvests of Argentina's principal commodity
exports have improved.
Venezuela's foreign exchange reserves dropped about $750 million in
the first six weeks of 1988, partly because of the fall in oil export
prices, before recovering in the second half of February. At end-
February, central bank liquid operating reserves, by the government's
definition, were $3.1 billion, compared with $3.5 billion at end-1987.
Factors contributing to the recovery in reserves include receipt by the
government of the proceeds of a $100 million international bond issue
(mostly subscribed by Venezuelan financial corporations to meet foreign
currency reserve requirements), sales of non-monetary gold, and a trans-
fer of about $380 million to the central bank from the state-owned
Venezuelan Investment Fund. Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in January
and fell 1.9 percent in February, led by a fall in food prices that is
largely due to seasonal factors. This halted an acceleration of infla-
tion that brought consumer prices in December 1987 to a level 40 percent
above a year earlier.
Ecuador introduced a new exchange rate system on March 3 in
response to the dramatic depreciation of the sucre in February. Pre-
viously, most private transactions had taken place at the free market
rate. The new "free-controlled" rate for the sucre price of the dollar,
applicable to most commercial transactions, has been set by the govern-
ment at a level well below the free market rate. The move followed a
series of unsuccessful attempts to relieve pressure on the sucre through

IV-29
more stringent import controls. Commitments to the $350 million commer-
cial bank loan agreed to in October 1987 have reached about $328 million
and continue to be sought.
In early March, Peru announced a series of measures to stabilize
the country's accelerating inflation and burgeoning trade deficit.
Government-controlled prices for gasoline and food staples were raised
by 30 to 60 percent, and were then frozen for 120 days. Utility tariffs
have also been raised, and the national sales tax was increased. Many
import categories have been shifted to classifications subject to more
depreciated exchange rates, and a parallel market for transactions not
supported by central bank sales of foreign exchange--including tourism
and non-priority imports--has been legalized.
Bolivia's commercial bank creditors have agreed to sell back to the
government $308 million of debt at 11 percent of face value under an
innovative debt-buyback program. The amount represents nearly 50 per-
cent of Bolivia's total commercial bank debt. (Bolivia's total external
debt is $4.1 billion.) Of the buyback transaction, $268 million
reportedly was sold for cash and $40 million for 25-year bonds, denomi-
nated in bolivianos, that can be used for investments in Bolivia. The
government will seek to renegotiate the remainder of its commercial bank
debt at a later date.
On February 12, Cote d'Ivoire reached an agreement with its commer-
cial bank creditors to reschedule 100 percent of its arrears on
principal at end-1987 as well as the principal payments falling due in
1988-95. The banks also agreed to provide new money amounting to $150
million--enough to cover only 1987 interest arrears. A new approach is

IV-30
being considered to force all creditor banks to participate in the
agreement in some way. Banks that do not want to provide new money
would be given the option to convert their existing loans into exit
bonds paying a fixed rate of interest over 25 years. Those banks that
neither provide new money nor accept exit bonds would not be allowed to
benefit from the clearing of interest arrears, although they would share
in principal repayments rescheduled under the arrangement. Implementa-
tion awaits confirmation of the arrangement's conformity with existing
laws and regulations.
