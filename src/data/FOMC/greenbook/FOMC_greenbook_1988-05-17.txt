DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Strong labor market data for April suggest that the economy was
expanding vigorously as the second quarter began. The unemployment rate
dropped two-tenths of a percent last month and aggregate hours were up
sharply, especially in industries that are benefiting from the strength
in U.S. exports and in domestic capital spending. Prices and wages also
have picked up a bit in recent months.
Labor Markets
The rise in nonfarm payroll employment in April of about 175,000
was smaller than the average monthly increase in the first quarter, but
that gain was accompanied by widespread increases in the length of
workweeks, pushing aggregate hours of production workers up about
1 percent. Moreover, employment as measured by the household survey
posted an especially large gain last month that more than reversed its
sharp drop in March, and the civilian unemployment rate fell to
5.4 percent. Since the beginning of the year, both surveys have posted
job gains totaling about 1 million, and the jobless rate has fallen
0.4 percentage point.
To a large extent, the slowing in payroll employment growth
observed in April reflected a leveling off in construction jobs and a
second month of weakness in retail trade. However, both of these
industries had posted unusually large job gains earlier this year, and
current employment levels remain well above those seen in December. In
manufacturing, employment advanced 44,000 in April, and job gains were
revised up in both February and March. Much of the recent strength in

hiring has occurred in industries that have seen export-led production
increases--most notably fabricated metals and nonelectrical machinery.
In addition, factory workweeks and overtime hours have stayed at high
levels in recent months, although the April figures may have been
exaggerated by the difficulties of seasonally adjusting for the timing
of the Easter holiday. Elsewhere, employment in oil and gas
extraction climbed 14,000 in April, apparently reflecting a pickup in
oil drilling activity in late March and early April. In services, job
gains totaled 55,000, led by continued growth in health services.
A combination of further increases in labor force participation--
which currently stands at 65.9 percent, 0.2 percentage point above its
fourth-quarter average--and continued population growth has pushed up
the size of the labor force by an average 150,000 per month so far this
year, close to the average monthly rise seen in 1987. However, in
contrast to the patterns observed last year, when participation among
adult women rose sharply, much of the recent rise reflects higher
participation among adult men, whose rate had edged down in the second
half of 1987. Participation among adult women has continued to move up,
but at a less rapid pace than in 1987, while the participation rate for
teenagers, which is quite volatile, has declined.
Over the past year, employment growth has become better balanced,
and the regional and occupational dispersions in labor market
1. The seasonal adjustment procedures used by BLS do not make explicit
allowance for changes in the timing of the Easter holiday, which could
account for as much as half of the 0.8 percent increase in aggregate
manufacturing hours, but at most, 0.1 of the 1.0 percent growth in total
aggregate hours.

performance have narrowed. In particular, the pickup in industrial
activity has fueled job gains in areas where labor markets were
depressed in late 1986 and early 1987, and declines in unemployment
rates in the rust belt and oil patch typically have been larger than
those registered in the already tight labor markets of the New England
and Mid-Atlantic regions.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Given the strength in production worker hours in manufacturing and
the available physical product data, total industrial production appears
to have posted a sizable gain in April.2 The labor market data
suggest that output of products--particularly machinery--continued to
advanced rapidly last month, while materials production appears to have
risen moderately. Among the available physical product data, auto
assemblies, paper, crude oil extraction, and coal mining increased last
month, while steel output, drilling rigs, electricity generation, and
truck assemblies declined.
Strong domestic demand--especially for computers--and continued
growth in exports has led to robust gains in the production of business
equipment. Output of parts for capital goods--for example,
semiconductors, computer parts, and bearings and gears--also has posted
solid advances. As a result, operating rates at both suppliers and
final goods producers in the capital goods lines have risen appreciably
2. Around 85 percent of the first estimate of industrial production is
based on changes in production worker hours; the remaining 15 percent is
based largely on physical product data (for example, auto and truck
assemblies, drilling rigs, output of raw steel and paperboard, and
refinery runs of petroleum products).

this year. Nonetheless, utilization in most of these industries remains
below 80 percent, suggesting that there still is considerable potential
for further output growth.
Output of consumer goods has been mixed. Auto assemblies increased
in March and rose further in April to a 7 million unit annual rate.
Production of some types of nondurable consumer goods--for example,
medicines and paper products--also has picked up. In contrast, output
of appliances, furniture, and clothing has declined, apparently in part
related to excess retail inventories of such items.
After declining sharply during the first two months of this year,
materials output appears to have recovered somewhat in March and April.
The weakness earlier this year was widespread. For example, production
of textiles has declined since last fall, apparently owing to declines
in output of clothing, carpeting and furniture, and, until recently,
autos. Output in this industry seems to have continued weak in April.
In addition, some industries, most notably paper, appear to be facing
capacity constraints. Among durable materials, output of steel weakened
during the first quarter, but has firmed in recent weeks.
Personal Income and Consumption
Real disposable personal income rose 3-1/4 percent in the first
quarter after an even larger 5-1/4 percent gain in the second half of
1987. The rise in real DPI in the first quarter was bolstered by a
reduction in income taxes and a relatively low rate of consumer price
inflation, which partially offset a notable slowing in nominal personal
income growth. Nominal income gains were damped by increases in

personal contributions for social insurance, reflecting a hike in the
FICA tax rate and an increase in the maximum taxable wage. In addi-
tion, farm income fell sharply, and increases in interest income were
much smaller than in recent quarters. In contrast, wages and salaries
continued to rise at about the average pace of 1987, and transfer
payments showed a pronounced rise, mainly owing to cost-of-living
adjustments in social security benefits.
Real consumer spending rebounded in the first quarter, increasing
3-3/4 percent at an annual rate, after dropping 2-1/2 percent in the
fourth quarter. In part, the growth in outlays reflected higher
purchases of motor vehicles, which were boosted by automakers' incentive
plans. However, spending on furniture--where inventory buildups had
been evident at the beginning of the year--also rose sharply, and
expenditures on services were up 4 percent, about the same pace as the
average for 1987. In contrast, spending on nondurables remained soft,
as outlays on clothing declined for the second quarter in a row, and
spending in other major categories was little changed.
In April, sales of motor vehicles fell somewhat, owing to declines
in both domestic cars and trucks; sales of imported vehicles were
unchanged. Sales of domestically produced autos fell from a 7.9 million
unit annual rate in March to a 7.2 million unit annual rate in April,
and sales of light trucks were down as well. Auto incentives programs
3. The increase in the employee share of social security taxes

estimated to have been around $7 billion at an annual rate in the first
quarter, somewhat smaller than the net reduction in personal income
taxes attributable to tax reform.

were cut back after the first ten-day period in May; consequently,
sales, while perhaps brisk in the first reporting period, may drop off
significantly later this month.
Because strong sales and lower first-quarter production of domestic
autos have reduced dealers' inventories to more comfortable levels, the
manufacturers have revised up their assembly schedules. They now plan
to produce more than 7-1/4 million units at an annual rate in both the
second and third quarters, compared with 6-1/4 million units in the
first quarter. All other things equal, the increase in auto production,
if realized, will add 1-1/4 percentage points at an annual rate to real
GNP growth in the second quarter.
Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for business fixed investment jumped 21 percent at an
annual rate in the first quarter, reflecting a surge in purchases of
4equipment. Spending for nonresidential construction, in contrast,
declined somewhat. Over the past year, investment spending has risen
nearly 15 percent.
The rise in equipment outlays last quarter, which exceeded
30 percent at an annual rate, was fueled by a jump in spending on office
and computing equipment. Outlays for other types of business equipment
4. Although equipment spending undoubtedly was strong in the first
quarter, the reported increase may have been overstated because of
difficulties in seasonal adjustment related to major changes in tax laws
in recent years. In particular, the Tax Act of 1986 reduced incentives
that previously had caused equipment purchases to be bunched in the
second and fourth quarters. However, current seasonal factors continue
to reflect, in part, the quarterly pattern of outlays during 1986 and
earlier years. As a result, these seasonals "expect" spending in the
first and third quarters to be relatively weak, which artificially
boosted spending growth last quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis.

also were strong, rising at a 15 percent annual rate, as demand for
industrial machinery continued to expand and purchases of motor vehicles
were boosted by renewed incentive programs.
Real outlays for nonresidential construction fell in the first
quarter, with declines in office and other commercial construction, and
petroleum drilling. After advancing for two quarters, office
construction edged down last quarter. Industrial construction continued
to rise, but the gains were slight, perhaps reflecting some reluctance
on the part of manufacturers to undertake the major commitments implied
by building new plants; reports still are widespread of concerns about a
rebound in the dollar or a recession undercutting the profitability of
long gestation period investments.
Given the extraordinary rise in business fixed investment in the
first quarter, it would not be surprising to see a lull in business
spending in the next few months. Indeed, orders, which rose rapidly
through January, softened in February and March, and contracts for
nonresidential construction have shown little trend for several
quarters. Recent surveys of investment plans, taken by the Commerce
Department and McGraw-Hill, both indicate that firms plan to increase
nominal outlays 8-3/4 percent this year. Because the first-quarter
level of nominal BFI already was 7-1/2 percent above the 1987 average,
these surveys, if borne out, also suggest slower growth in business
investment, even allowing for some conceptual differences between the
survey-based spending figures and the BFI data.

II-12
Business Inventories
Nonfarm inventory investment slowed in the first quarter,
reflecting the sizable liquidation of auto stocks. Outside of autos,
the accumulation of inventories continued, but has generally been in
line with growth in shipments and sales.
Manufacturers' inventories increased moderately in the first
quarter. Most of the accumulation occurred at industries with firm
order books; they include machinery and business equipment (especially
office and computing equipment), aircraft, chemicals, printing, and
paper products. The overall factory inventory-sales ratio has changed
little, on net, since late 1987 and remains low by historical standards.
Inventories of merchant wholesalers expanded considerably early
this year. However, most of the accumulation was at sellers of
machinery, in part reflecting higher levels of activity in capital
goods markets; and changes in other wholesale stocks have been
relatively small. Thus, the buildup in stocks at this level does not
appear to be a significant concern. Data on nonauto retail stocks,
which are available only through February, show little change in
inventory positions early this year. Although additions to stocks have
been small, the inventory-sales ratio in this sector remains very high.
Housing Markets
Housing market activity was a bit stronger in March, but remained
below the levels of recent years. Total housing starts edged up to a
1.54 million unit annual rate, as a robust gain in single-family starts

more than offset another slump in the multifamily sector. Issuance of
building permits also rose slightly.
The rise in single-family housing activity in February and March
was spurred, in part, by lower interest rates, which were a touch below
10 percent for conventional fixed rate loans, and by an improvement in
both consumer and builder attitudes. The March level of starts--
1.19 million units at an annual rate--was toward the upper end of the
range of the last year. New-home sales rose 4 percent in March to
655,000 units, and sales of existing homes increased by 3 percent to
3.3 million units.
In contrast to the single-family sector, multifamily starts dropped
12 percent in March to 358,000 units, the lowest rate in nearly six
years. On a quarterly basis, multifamily starts have declined without
interruption since the end of 1985, as near-record high vacancy rates
have muted incentives to build. In the first quarter of 1988, the
multifamily vacancy rate was nearly 10 percent, only slightly below the
series high set in the third quarter of last year.
The moderate pace of housing activity has been accompanied by an
apparent slowing in the year-to-year rate of increase in home prices.
Constant-quality new home prices increased only 1-1/2 percent over the
year ending in Ql, at the low end of the range observed in recent years.
Increases in median prices of new (and existing) homes--not adjusted for
changes in quality or regional mix--while quite volatile, also seem to
have slowed from the extemely rapid year-over-year increases in late
1987.

II-17
Federal Government
A deficit of $29.1 billion was recorded in the federal unified
budget in March. As shown in the accompanying table, the deficit for
the fiscal year to date remains $4.3 billion below the total recorded
over the comparable period of last year. However, such comparisons are
potentially misleading as an indicator of the full year deficit because
several special factors that worked to reduce last year's deficit did
not affect the federal accounts until after March of 1987. They
included the surge of capital gains tax receipts last April, a bunching
of federal asset sales late in the year, and shifts-in the timing of
some spending.
Preliminary data for April and early May indicate that nonwithheld
tax receipts--mostly from the final payments on taxpayers' prior year
tax liabilities and the first estimated tax payments for the current
year--were relatively large. This strength apparently reflects capital
gains realizations generated in last year's unusually volatile financial
markets, the base-broadening provisions of tax reform, and
underwithholding early last year (when withholding tables and the value
of withholding allowances were changed). Nonetheless, nonwithheld
receipts were about $8 billion below a year earlier, when final payments
had been swollen by the surge in capital gains realizations induced in
1986 by tax reform. Meanwhile, growth in refunds has been negligible.
Withheld taxes, which include income taxes and total social
security contributions, have increased substantially in response to
higher taxable incomes as well as the increase in the social security

tax rate. There has been some offset, however, from the cut in
individual income tax withholding rates that went into effect on
January 1, as mandated in the 1986 tax act.
Growth of corporate tax receipts appears weak when viewed in the
context of the base-broadening and corporate accounting provisions of
the 1986 tax act, which some analysts had expected to raise corporate
payments substantially. March receipts, which are mostly the final
payment on the prior year's liability, were down slightly from the year-
earlier level. Preliminary April data indicate that the first quarterly
estimated corporate tax payment on 1988 tax liability increased about
$3 billion over last year. However, last April's receipts were
depressed by safe harbor regulations that allowed corporations to defer
some of their tax payments to September because of the difficulty of
accurately determining tax liability immediately after the enactment of
tax reform.
On the outlay side of the budget, spending in the first half of the
fiscal year grew a bit more rapidly than last year. March data show
some acceleration in entitlement spending, particularly for Medicare,
whose growth had been restrained by cost containment provisions included
in most of the deficit-cutting bills enacted in recent years. The
pickup in overall spending occurred even though asset sales, which count
as a negative outlay in the budget, restrained outlay growth more than
during the corresponding year-earlier period. By March, about
27 percent of the $10.9 billion of asset sales and advance loan
prepayments planned for 1988 had been completed. In 1987, only about

II-20
12 percent of $5.6 billion annual total in asset sales took place in the
first half of the fiscal year.
Both houses of Congress have passed versions of a Congressional
Budget Resolution that are broadly consistent with last fall's budget
summit agreement with the administration. Nevertheless, the conference
committee charged with reconciling differences in the details of the
resolutions--primarily in the higher spending for space, science, and
anti-drug programs proposed in the Senate version--failed to complete
its work before suspending discussion in the first week of May for the
Senate recess.
State and Local Governments
Growth in real purchases of goods and services by state and local
governments apparently slowed in the first quarter after a strong gain
in the fourth quarter of last year. Real spending on construction,
based on BEA seasonals, increased slightly during the first quarter,
and state and local employment moved up through April. Even so, the
trend in total purchases seems subdued compared to the 1983-86 period,
with the moderation likely stemming from recent fiscal problems.
Budgetary pressure among the states continued in fiscal 1988, but
the adjustment process appears to be easing. During FY1988, which ends
June 30 in most states, only 11 states have cut expenditures below
planned levels, compared with 24 states the year before. In addition,
just 14 states are planning tax increases this year, compared with
34 states last year. For the current year, real aggregate general funds
outlays appear to be increasing at their slowest rate since 1983.

Nonetheless the overall year-end balance is expected to be about the
same as last year, both in absolute terms and as a share of expendi-
tures. Fifteen states are expecting year-end balances that are
1 percent or less of general funds expenditures in the current fiscal
year, also about the same as in FY87. The seemingly weakest fiscal
positions are geographically widespread. While several of the energy
states remain among the most troubled states, others are scattered.
Prices
Most broad measures of prices have been increasing at about a
3 to 4 percent annual rate so far this year. An exception was the
2-1/2 percent rise in the GNP implicit price deflator for the first
quarter. A surge in spending on computers, which have a relatively low
price level, was the principal factor holding down the rise in the
deflator.
Prices at the consumer and producer levels rose more rapidly in
March than in preceding months. The consumer price index for all urban
consumers advanced 0.5 percent, after an increase of only 0.2 percent in
February. Producer prices of finished goods, which dropped in February,
rose 0.6 percent in March. In part, the pickup reflected an apparent
bottoming out of energy prices, as declines in this component had held
down inflation over the preceding four months. However, prices also
picked up in March for food, apparel, and some other consumer goods;
nonenergy service prices increased at a rate close to the average
monthly pace of the past six months. So far this year, the CPI has

of expenditures to be prudent.

risen at an annual rate of 4-1/4 percent, about 1/2 percentage point
above the average rate in the second half of last year.
Retail energy prices leveled off in March, as small increases for
gasoline and fuel oil offset some declines for natural gas and elec-
tricity. Spot prices of crude oil moved up about three dollars per
barrel from early March through the end of April, but retraced about
one-third of that increase when the recent meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC
oil producers failed to produce an agreement on output cuts. Posted
prices also have been higher in the past month and a half, which, in
conjunction with higher spot prices, suggests some upward pressure on
prices of refined petroleum products in the near term.
Retail food prices rose 0.3 percent in March, reversing their
February decline. At the farm level, crude food prices increased
0.8 percent, and more recent developments in commodity prices suggest
that this index may have risen further in April. So far this year,
crude food prices have shown a marked uptrend, more than reversing their
declines over the second half of 1987. Year-end futures prices for both
livestock and crops also have generally moved higher since the last FOMC
meeting; and for some farm commodities, further price increases may be
in store, in view of the tightening inventory positions reported in the
USDA's supply-demand projections of May 10.
Excluding both food and energy items, the CPI jumped 0.6 percent in
March, after a February increase of 0.2 percent. The acceleration was
concentrated in the commodities component, particularly apparel, which
climbed more than 2 percent with the introduction of new higher-priced

II-25
spring and summer merchandise. In part, the rise in apparel prices
reflected the ending of widespread markdowns to reduce inventories; the
index for apparel commodities had dropped about 1 percent over the
preceding three months. But higher prices for imported goods also
appear to have contributed to the rise in clothing prices. According to
the BLS import price indexes for March, prices of imported clothing were
8 percent above their year-earlier levels. Import prices also continued
to rise rapidly for a number of household and recreational goods.
Domestic producer prices of some consumer goods--notably apparel
and furniture--also have picked up. In March, the PPI for finished
consumer goods (less food and energy) rose 0.4 percent, with large
increases in a number of categories. At the intermediate stage of
processing, the PPI less food and energy rose 0.7 percent further in
March. Large increases were registered for products of several
industries operating at high rates of capacity utilization, notably
chemicals, paper, plastics, and most metals. This index has risen at a
7-1/2 percent annual rate over the past six months, well above the
4-1/2 percent pace during the preceding nine months.
Prices of crude nonfood materials less energy advanced 1.4 percent
in March, with further large increases for scrap metals and hides. From
the mid-March pricing date through May 10, the pattern of spot price
changes in industrial commodity markets was mixed, with net declines for
6. With the CPI revision of 1987, the BLS altered its procedures for
introducing new apparel styles into the index. These changes, not yet
reflected in the seasonal factors, have tended to result in sharp jumps
in the (seasonally adjusted) apparel index in March and April, and again
in September and October.

II-26
copper and steel scrap but firming for zinc. Aluminum prices registered
wide swings over this period, and on balance, net gains with respect to
mid-March. Prices of all of the above metals remain at historically
high levels reflecting tight world markets.
Wages and Labor Costs
Recent data on labor costs generally show some firming in wages for
workers in segments of the labor market that have experienced strong
demand since the middle of last year, as well as sharp runups in some
components of benefit costs. As measured by the employment cost index
for private industry workers, compensation rose 3.9 percent over the
12 months ended in March, about 3/4 percentage point more than in the
previous 12-month period. Wages and salaries were up 3.3 percent over
the year, while benefits jumped 5.8 percent, boosted both by the January
payroll tax increase and sharply higher employer costs for health
insurance. Excluding sales workers, whose wages are heavily influenced
by volatile commissions, wages and salaries rose 3.6 percent and
compensation was up 4.2 percent.
A separate measure of nonfarm compensation, reported in the BLS
release on productivity and costs, rose 3.4 percent at an annual rate in
the first quarter to a level 3-1/2 percent above a year earlier, a
smaller gain than indicated by the employment cost index. Although
there are numerous conceptual differences between the two compensation
measures, the discrepancy over the past year probably reflects
differences in the treatment of benefits. In the ECI, benefit costs are
surveyed directly and thus are likely to provide a relatively accurate

picture of current developments. However, in the productivity and costs
measure of hourly compensation, benefits are based on an extrapolation
of past trends, and, therefore, do not capture all of the pickup evident
in the ECI survey.
Hourly compensation gains now appear more balanced across
industries, occupations, and regions than had been the case in recent
years. By industry, the largest pickup in compensation growth occurred
in manufacturing (especially among durable goods producers), where
increases in output have led to some firming in labor markets. Higher
compensation inflation also is evident in the service-producing sector
when compared to a year earlier, although much of this acceleration
occurred before the stock market crash. After the crash, compensation
increases dropped sharply for workers in finance, insurance, and real
estate, and leveled off in most other service-producing industries.
The strength in the industrial sector also has been reflected in
the pattern of compensation change by occupation, region, and union
status. Larger increases recently have been evident for all blue-collar
occupations. By region, compensation picked up more rapidly in the
South and Midwest--areas benefiting from the improvement in heavy
manufacturing. In addition, union compensation changes rose nearly
4 percent in the 12 months ended in March, matching the pace in the
nonunion sector for the first time since 1983. Much of that
acceleration, which occurred primarily in manufacturing, reflects
sharply higher benefit costs for union workers, probably because union

II-29
contracts limit employers from adapting fringe benefit plans--especially
for health insurance--to changes in the costs of those plans.
Despite the pickup in overall union wages, recent settlements
suggest that wages remain restrained in industries that continue to face
competitive pressures. In trucking, where competition from nonunion
firms has reduced the number of employed union members by more than one-
third since the industry was deregulated in 1980, the National Master
Freight Agreement provides for an initial wage increase of only 2-1/4
percent and a maximum increase of 7 percent over three years. In the
rubber industry, where union membership has dropped by nearly 40 percent
over the past decade, recent contracts provide for a freeze of base
wages over three years, although fairly generous COLA payments would
still be made.
Finally, productivity in the nonfarm business sector is estimated
to have risen about 1 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter,
reversing the downward-revised decline in the fourth quarter of 1987.
Over the past year, output per hour advanced about 1-1/2 percent,
partially offsetting the 3-1/2 percent rise in hourly compensation and
holding the increase in unit labor costs to 2 percent. Unit labor costs
were even more restrained in manufacturing, owing both to better
productivity performance and smaller increases in hourly compensation.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have risen considerably since the March FOMC meet-
ing. Investment demand by the private sector appears to be pressing on
available supplies of savings, and financial market participants have
become increasingly concerned about inflationary risks associated with
diminishing slack in labor and product markets. System actions have
been subjected to close scrutiny; analysts generally concluded in the
week after the meeting that reserve positions had been tightened
slightly, and expectations of some further firming preceded the more
recent snugging of the funds market.
The federal funds rate now has risen about 1/2 percentage point
since late March, with trading around 7 percent in the past few days.
Most other market rates of interest are up between 3/8 and 5/8 of a
point from levels prevailing at the time of the last FOMC meeting, with
only a modest diminution in the fairly steep slope of the yield curve.
The spread between the prime rate and the 3-month CD rate has narrowed
to about 130 basis points.
The narrower monetary aggregates grew rapidly in April. Expansion
of M1 and M2 edged into the 10-percent area during a month in which tax-
related flows often obscure underlying trends. Meanwhile, growth in M3
slowed a bit in April, reducing the aggregate's rate of increase since
the fourth quarter to about 7 percent in contrast to 7-3/4 percent for
M2.
Private credit demands showed signs of strength as the second
quarter got under way. Business borrowing was robust in April, with

emphasis shifting back toward loans and away from bond issuance.
A substantial part of business borrowing again was related to mergers
and share buybacks. Few data are available yet for households, but
growth in consumer loans at banks continued at a fast pace in April and
mortgage borrowing may be on a mild upswing in line with increases in
sales of new and existing homes in March. Public sector credit demands
were not so strong: the Treasury's need to raise funds is typically
light in the second quarter, and borrowing by state and local govern-
ments in April dipped well below the first-quarter average.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Growth in M1 and M2 increased further in April to annual rates
around 10 percent, owing partly to a buildup in transaction accounts to
meet income tax payments. Demand and NOW deposits strengthened markedly
around midmonth, at the same time that several types of liquid savings
instruments--MMDAs, savings deposits, and M2-type MMMFs--were exhibiting
weakness. The effect of tax obligations thus accentuated the already
sluggish growth of MMDAs and savings deposits that was attributable in
large part to a rise in the opportunity cost of holding such instruments
as compared with small time deposits; the latter have been growing
briskly since last fall.
M2 was also buoyed in April by an increase in overnight RPs and
Eurodollar deposits. At the M3 level, this increase was offset by a
comparable decline in term RPs and Eurodollars. Moreover, institution-
only money market mutual funds contracted sharply in April, as rising
market interest rates reduced their attractiveness. With growth in core

deposits apparently strong enough to finance a pickup in bank credit
growth, banks were able to run off some large time deposits. Together,
these factors held M3 growth to a 6 percent rate.
Bank credit is estimated to have accelerated in April to an 11-1/2
percent annual rate of growth. Loan growth doubled, while security
acquisitions remained rather brisk. The vigor in lending reflected a
surge in business loans to a 20 percent rate, the strongest advance
since the tax-related bulge around year-end 1986. Real estate loans
continued to expand at the 11 percent pace maintained during the first
quarter; increased write-offs of real estate loans, especially by large
Texas banks, impeded expansion in that category, but sizable increases
in revolving home equity loans (probably for tax payments) buttressed
growth of real estate debt. Consumer loans slowed only a little from
their rapid March pace.
Business Finance
Although the Commerce Department has yet to publish an estimate of
corporate profits for the first quarter, the Board staff estimates that
they edged lower. Capital expenditures apparently were about flat, as
reduced inventory accumulation offset stronger fixed investment, so that
the gap between outlays and internal funds probably widened. At the
same time, the pace of net retirements of equity shares picked up, ad-
ding to borrowing needs. Nonfinancial firms increased their reliance on
the bond markets in the first quarter, while business loan growth and
issuance of commercial paper, which had been very strong at the end of
last year, eased off.

III-7
Available data for April suggest that total borrowing by nonfinan-
cial firms strengthened a bit on balance from the already robust first-
quarter pace, and that firms shifted the focus of their borrowing some-
what away from the bond market and back toward bank loans, as long-term
financing costs rose. New bond offerings by nonfinancial firms of an
estimated $7-1/4 billion in April were off $1/2 billion from March,
while business loan demand rebounded strongly. The turnaround in busi-
ness loans partly reflected unusual borrowing in late March and early
April associated with the Texaco payment to Pennzoil and other merger-
related loans.1 Although commercial paper issuance slowed markedly in
April, the sum of business loans plus commercial paper expanded at
nearly an 18 percent rate, well above the pace of recent months.
The continuing heavy retirement of stock as a result of acquisi-
tions and share repurchases has greatly influenced both the volume and
the composition of borrowing. A substantial portion of March's commer-
cial paper growth resulted from issuance to pay down a merger-related
bank loan, and more than half of the April increase in business loans at
large banks was associated with mergers. The volume of high-yield debt
offerings, often used to help finance acquisitions and leveraged
buyouts, has remained low both absolutely and relative to the level of
investment-grade debt offerings. This may reflect both the uncertain
1. Pennzoil borrowed a total of $2.7 billion in advance of the Texaco
payment in order to invest the funds gradually. Texaco borrowed $3
billion on April 6 for its scheduled payment to Pennzoil on April 7,
after which the Pennzoil bank loans were repaid. In addition, Allegis
borrowed an estimated $2.4 billion for its buyback of stock at the end
of March.

The sizable foreign participation in acquisitions activity that
emerged in 1987 has persisted this year. Of the mergers of nonfinancial
firms in 1987 that exceeded $1 billion, one-third of both the number of
acquisitions and the value of transactions involved a foreign firm ac-
quiring a domestic one. This pattern has continued in 1988, with for-
eign acquisitions accounting for $14 billion of the $45 billion total of
2completed or pending large mergers. Moreover, the influence of
2. Mergers & Acquisitions, which tracks a broader set of corporate
restructurings, including divestitures and mergers of both financial and
nonfinancial firms, indicates a doubling in importance of the dollar
volume of acquisitions by foreign corporations from 12 percent in 1986
to 26 percent in 1987.

III-10
foreign firms in the U.S. merger market extends beyond these figures on
completed transactions in that some other foreign firms have been active
competitors for target companies that ultimately were acquired by domes-
tic firms.
Merger activity also appears to have put upward pressure on the
yields of the debt of some potential takeover targets, although the
limited price data for their bonds make estimates of the effect dif-
ficult. An examination of the yield spreads between outstanding debt of
a small sample of firms that currently are takeover targets and Moody's
indexes for bonds of the same rating classifications revealed a widening
of spreads by 50 to 100 basis points when merger proposals first were
announced. In two instances, yields on the debt of takeover candidates
continued to rise in subsequent months, reaching levels 1-1/2 to 2 per-
centage points above the indexes. These results differ from the find-
ings of past research on this topic, including some conducted at the
Board, that generally showed little effect from takeovers on the wealth
of bondholders in acquired firms.
In equity markets, share prices are little changed from their
levels at the time of the last FOMC, although day-to-day price
volatility has increased somewhat of late. Share offerings by nonfinan-
cial firms were very light again in April, as corporations continued to
delay offerings because of relatively low prices and continuing concerns
about the possibility of large unpredictable price swings. Thus far in
1988, issuance of shares by nonfinancial firms has averaged less than a
third of the pace seen over the first three quarters of 1987 when share

III-11
prices averaged nearly 20 percent higher than they have this year. The
bulk of financial issues continue to be offered by closed-end mutual
funds; large share flotations of this type boosted financial volume in
March, but even these offerings tapered off in April.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The federal government budget is expected to be about in balance in
the second quarter, because of the seasonal inflow of tax revenues.
The staff projects that the Treasury will borrow a total of $9 billion
in the market this quarter and will end the quarter with a $30 billion
3cash balance. Nonmarketable borrowing is expected to be fairly small,
at $2.5 billion, in view of the limited needs of state and local govern-
ments to accommodate their relatively light advance refunding activity.
Over the second quarter, the Treasury is expected to continue to
emphasize issuance of coupon securities. It will raise about $21 bil-
lion through coupon issues while the paydown in bills is expected to
deepen to $12 billion as add-on purchases of bills by foreign central
banks decline. Sizable exchange market intervention and portfolio
diversification by some foreign central banks had caused an above-
average volume of add-ons in December and January. Combined add-ons of
coupons and bills are expected to fall from about $16 billion in the
first quarter to about $8 billion in the second quarter. In April, add-
ons totaled $2.8 billion, with about $1.1 billion occurring in bills, in
line with projections for the quarter.
3. The Treasury sees a considerably smaller marketable financing need
in the second quarter, but a correspondingly bigger need in the third
quarter, than does the Board staff.

Borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies is expected to
increase significantly during the second quarter, reflecting in part the
seasonal need for funds of the housing-related agencies. Increased
borrowing by FICO, the agency created last year to inject funds into the
FSLIC, also is expected to boost the sponsored agencies' credit demands.
In early May, FICO sold $750 million of 30-year bonds to a single
underwriter, who reoffered the securities to the market as coupon and
principal strips. After the offering of the strips, which took many
market participants by surprise, the yield spread between FICO's out-
standing 30-year bonds and comparable 30-year Treasury securities nar-
rowed from 113 basis points to 100 basis points. The structuring of the
new issue and its success apparently caused market participants to lower
their expectations of the near-term supply of whole, marketable 30-year
bonds. In the three months prior to the offering, the spread had risen
about 30 basis points, reflecting investors' expectation that supplies
would swell because Congress eventually would raise FICO's current $10.8
billion borrowing limit in order for FSLIC to deal with the financial
problems of the S&L industry. Investors also were concerned that a
large new offering of bonds by FICO would reduce its ability to service
its debt.
Concern about the financial condition of FSLIC has affected yields
on the Federal Home Loan Banks' securities as well. Yield spreads be-
tween their securities and comparable Treasury securities were 8 to 14
basis points higher in the Banks' April financing than in March. In
contrast to these wider spreads, the yield on the Farm Credit System's

III-14
6-month bond fell 15 basis points relative to the 6-month Treasury bill
rate at the System's April offering. But the decline in that spread
resulted from a smaller volume of issuance, rather than from a change in
the market's view of the System's riskiness.
Municipal Securities
Issuance of long-term tax-exempt securities dropped off substan-
tially in April. Long-term issuance has averaged $7-1/2 billion a month
this year--still up marginally from last year's second half, but all of
the gain reflects increased refunding volume. The raising of new capi-
tal so far in 1987 has averaged about $4.6 billion per month, compared
with a $5 billion monthly pace over the second half of last year.

p--preliminary.
The Supreme Court's recent adverse ruling on the tax-exempt status
of municipal securities apparently had no lasting effect on prices in

4the secondary market. They fell sharply on news of the decision, but
quickly rallied to pre-announcement levels. Few informed market ob-
servers expect any noticeable near-term effect on the market for munici-
pal issues, although most expect to see renewed efforts by Congress to
restrict further the tax-exempt status of private-purpose municipal
bonds.
Mortgage Markets
The average contract rate on new commitments for 30-year, fixed-
rate conventional home mortgages has risen 33 basis points in the
primary market since the last FOMC meeting, about in step with increases
in secondary mortgage market yields. In contrast, the average initial
rate quoted on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) indexed to the yield on
one-year Treasuries has risen just 11 basis points since the March meet-
ing. Consequently, the initial rate advantage of ARMs has widened to
roughly 270 basis points, reversing the pattern that characterized the
early part of the year when fixed-rate quotes were declining. That
earlier narrowing of the initial rate advantage for ARMs had resulted in
a steady decline in the proportion of conventional home mortgages closed
with adjustable rates. Reflecting commitments made in previous months,
the ARM share in early April fell for the fourth consecutive month,
dropping to 48 percent compared with nearly 70 percent in December.
4. The Supreme Court overturned a 93-year-old interpretation of the
constitutional basis for tax-exempt status of municipal bond interest,
as part of reaching its decision on the narrow question posed by South
Carolina v. Baker, which was: Can the federal government withhold tax-
exempt status from municipal securities that are issued in "bearer"
rather than "registered" form?

If the more recent increase in the cost of fixed-rate financing is
sustained, homebuyers may shift back toward ARMs in coming months,
however. Encouraging such a shift is the continued willingness of
lenders to offer large initial-rate discounts on adjustable-rate
products. According to the results of the March FHLBB survey, about
half of the ARM loans closed in that month carried initial discounts of
a percentage point or more. Aggressive pricing of ARMs also is evident
in declining spreads between initial ARM rates and some common rates
used to index ARMs.
The volume of mortgages closed at FSLIC-insured thrifts increased
marginally to a seasonally adjusted $19.1 billion in March. The
moderate pickup in loan originations during February and March, follow-
ing January's 2-1/2-year low, was roughly in line with the pace of hous-
ing sales and construction during those months. Thrifts increased their
holdings of mortgage-related assets in March by the smallest amount
since January 1987. This resulted partly from a $2 billion sale of
pass-through securities by the troubled American Savings and Loan of
Stockton, California, which was directed by the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board earlier this year to reduce its portfolio of mortgage-backed
securities.
The recent shift in originations toward fixed-rate mortgages has
fueled a slight increase in issuance of federally related mortgage-
backed pass-through securities since January, although the volume
remains well below the average monthly pace registered in 1987.
Issuance of ARM-backed securities typically accounts for a very small

share of total federally related pass-throughs, reflecting the dominance
in the ARM market of "portfolio lenders" who retain most of the loans
they originate. In April, however, new ARM-backed issues jumped fairly
sharply. The private ARM-backed'pass-through market also seems poised
for some expansion in coming months. Home Savings of America, one of
the largest originators of ARM loans, announced recently that it plans
to sell between $100 and $200 million of such pass-throughs each month,
backed by ARMs that adjust monthly based on the FHLB Eleventh District
cost-of-funds index.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit grew at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate
in March, resulting in a first-quarter average (10-1/4 percent) that was
well above the growth experienced during 1987. Auto credit, driven by
strong sales of new cars and light trucks, advanced at a 14 percent rate
in March. Because the auto makers in their recent promotions have em-
phasized cash rebates more than the reduced-rate loans available from
their own finance subsidiaries, all lender groups have participated
substantially in the auto credit surge this year. Revolving credit in
March rose at a 16 percent rate and the "other" category contracted.
The strength in revolving credit continued the trend exhibited
over the preceding 12 months, during which growth averaged about 18
percent at an annual rate, despite the maintenance of relatively high
interest rates on credit cards and the phasing down of tax deductibility
of consumer interest expense. At banks, revolving credit climbed at a
17 percent rate during the 12-month period, and increases in excess of a

III-20
50 percent rate were reported for thrift institutions, which hold
roughly one-eighth of total revolving credit. Benchmark revisions to
the installment credit series show that the growth in revolving credit
was more rapid at all financial institutions last year than originally
estimated, as these institutions--especially thrifts--diverted customers
from closed-end cash loans to credit card and other open-end plans.
5. Thrift institutions for this calculation include savings and loans,
federal savings banks, mutual savings banks, and credit unions.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against the
other G-10 currencies has appreciated about 1/4 percent on balance since
the last FOMC meeting, as shown in Chart 1. The dollar strengthened
early in the intermeeting period, bolstered by perceptions of tighter
monetary policy in the United States. The release of disappointing U.S.
trade data in mid-April prompted a sharp decline in the dollar.
U.S. interest rates rose more than interest rates in most foreign
countries during the intermeeting period, and late in the period the
firmness in U.S. bond yields spilled over into foreign bond markets. As
indicated in Table 1, both short- and long-term rates in the United
States were up about 1/2 percentage point over the intermeeting period.
Short-term interest rates in Japan were flat, but long-term rates rose
nearly 15 basis points from the March FOMC meeting and 35 basis points
from mid-April. Three-month interbank rates in Germany firmed 20 basis
points, and rates for longer maturities rose 50 basis points during the
intermeeting period. Noting the movement in German interest rates
through the end of April, Bundesbank Vice President Schlesinger remarked
that German rates could be expected to increase if the dollar is steady
and U.S. interest rates rise. Although this statement seemed to refer

to a market-induced rise in long-term interest rates in Germany in the
face of expectations of fairly stable exchange rates, some market
participants interpreted these remarks as implying that the Bundesbank
might follow any move towards a tighter monetary policy by the Federal
Reserve. In Canada, both short- and long-term rates rose 30 basis
points. In contrast, short-term interest rates in the United Kingdom
fell, on balance, as the Bank of England again cut its money market
dealing rate 1/2 percentage point to just below 8 percent early in the
intermeeting period to curb sterling's strength. In other changes in
official rates, the Bank of Sweden raised its discount rate a full
percentage point to 8-1/2 percent in an effort to dampen credit creation
and high levels of consumer demand.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States increased by
$25 billion in the first quarter of 1988. (See line 4 of the Summary of
U.S. International Transactions Table.) Partial information from FRBNY
indicates additional inflows of $2.5 billion in April. Most of the
inflows were accounted for by the G-10 countries,
OPEC holdings in the United States continued to decline in the
first quarter of 1988, after dropping almost $9 billion in 1987.
Holdings of all other countries increased during the first quarter,
Reflecting the large increases in foreign official holdings in the
United States, net official purchases of U.S. Treasury securities (line
4b) were $27 billion in the first quarter of 1988. Of this total, $20
billion was in the form of bonds and notes and only $7 billion was in
the form of bills and certificates. Net private foreign purchases of
U.S. Treasury securities were also very large in the first quarter,
particularly in February. (See line 3.) A large part of the private
purchases was from financial centers, particularly London, so that the
identity of the ultimate investors is unknown. Net private foreign
purchases of Treasury securities were also concentrated in maturities of

Foreign participation in U.S. stock markets recovered gradually in
the first quarter. Net purchases were virtually zero (line 2b), but by
March, the gross volume of purchases and sales rose almost to the
monthly average for 1987. Foreign private net purchases of U.S.
corporate bonds (on a payments basis) were $2.6 billion in the first
quarter (line 2a). However, new issues of Eurobonds by U.S.
corporations were sharply depressed in March, and were almost
exclusively denominated in foreign currencies (marks, pounds, and
Canadian dollars). In contrast, new bond issues by U.S. corporations in
the domestic market did not show a similar decline. U.S. net purchases
of foreign securities picked up in the first quarter of 1988; most of
the increase consisted of bonds, although net purchases of stocks in
Japan were also substantial.
Banks reported a small net outflow in the first quarter of 1988.
(See line 1.) Inflows resulting from transactions with the World Bank
and reduced claims on Mexico were more than outweighed by outflows to
own foreign offices. As indicated on the International Banking Data
table (line 1), these outflows did not continue in April. The sharp
shift from inflows in 1987 to outflows in the first quarter was probably
related to several factors: strong growth in core deposits relative to
credit demands in the United States, an increase in loans booked
offshore because of a widening of the prime-Libor differential, a
decline in U.S. nonbank residents' holdings of Eurodollar deposits, and,

perhaps, the shift of funds out of the Euromarkets by certain official
monetary authorities. The end of outflows in April was associated with
a surge in bank credit at domestic banking offices and a narrowing of
the prime-Libor differential.
U.S. Merchandise Trade and Prices
Data on merchandise trade in February, released by the Census
Bureau last month, show that the nominal trade balance registered a
deficit of $13.8 billion (at a monthly rate, on a not seasonally
adjusted CIF basis) in February. The increase in the February deficit
from January's $12.4 billion figure can be traced primarily to a surge
in the value of non-oil imports, while nonagricultural exports grew less
than expected .(Census merchandise trade data for March will be
released on May 17.)

Correcting for seasonal factors and late documents, and
translating to a balance of payments basis, the February deficit is
estimated to have been $179 billion (at an annual rate), almost $40
billion worse than the January deficit and about $20 billion worse than

IV-9
the 1987-Q4 average. Taken together, the January and February deficits
averaged about $155 billion, roughly in line with staff expectations for
the first quarter. (First quarter merchandise trade data on a balance
of payments basis will be available May 25; in addition, revised data
for earlier years will be released at that time.) The slight
improvement in the January-February average relative to the fourth
quarter figure can be traced to increases in agricultural exports,
primarily corn and wheat, which supplemented the modest growth in
nonagricultural exports, and a decline in the value of imported oil,
which partially offset the rise in non-oil imports. The decline in oil
imports in the first quarter was due to falling oil prices, which
averaged $16.70 per barrel in the first two months of this year (on a
CIF basis), relative to the fourth quarter average of $18.40 per barrel.

The preliminary estimate for first quarter GNP, released by BEA
late last month, showed an improvement in NIA net exports of goods and
services in both nominal terms and real terms, relative to the fourth
quarter of last year. Real NIA net exports of goods and services, which
have shown quarterly improvements since mid-1986, are estimated to have
shown only a small improvement in the first quarter.

The NIA implicit deflator for nonagricultural exports was
relatively flat in the first quarter, while the deflator for non-oil
imports rose only modestly. The increase of 3.2 percent (at an annual
rate) in the deflator for non-oil imports can be contrasted with the 7.5
percent rise in the fixed-weighted price of non-oil imports (based on FR
staff estimates). In recent history, the implicit deflator for non-oil
imports has increased less rapidly than the fixed-weighted price due to

IV-11
both the growing proportion of business machinery imports, and the
decline in the prices of those imports. BEA's estimate of the implicit
deflator for non-oil imports could well be revised upward in subsequent
estimates of first quarter GNP, as BLS export and import price data
(discussed below) were not available when BEA made its preliminary
estimate.

According to BLS, prices of non-oil imports (not seasonally
adjusted) rose 9.5 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter,
somewhat below the 12.6 percent annual rate of increase recorded in the
fourth quarter of last year, but substantially above the increase in
BEA's implicit deflator shown in the preliminary GNP estimate (and
somewhat above FR staff estimates of the increase in the non-oil import
fixed-weighted price index). BLS information on prices of capital goods
excluding business machines, consumer goods, and automobiles will be
used in the revision of the GNP accounts. All of these components
showed increases in the first quarter, and taken together with recorded
increases in the prices of. industrial supplies (unit value indexes),

IV-12
imply an upward revision to the implicit deflator. Prices of exports
showed a 5.7 percent annual rate of increase in the first quarter, less
than the fourth quarter 1987 rate of 8.2 percent.
With this BLS press release, the weighting structure of import and
export price indexes has been updated to reflect U.S. international
trading patterns as of 1985. Indexes for 1985, 1986, and 1987 have been
recalculated using the updated weighting structure. The most
significant change in index behavior was related to the decline in the
relative importance of imported fuels.

Industrial Countries
Indicators of economic activity in the major industrial countries
during the first months of 1988 show continued strength in Japan, and,
on balance, in Europe as well. Industrial production in Japan
registered a large 3.7 (s.a.) percent increase in the first quarter. In
Germany, it increased by 1 percent (s.a.), despite a sharp fall in the

IV-16
preliminary estimate for March. In France, Canada, and the United
Kingdom, the average levels of industrial production (s.a.) declined in
the first two months of the yearfrom their December levels. However,
in each of these three countries unemployment has also declined,
suggesting that the weakness displayed by their industrial sectors is
not broadly based. Inflation remains low in most of the foreign G-7
countries.
Trends in external adjustment have been mixed so far in 1988.
Merchandise trade (s.a.) and current account (n.s.a.) surpluses narrowed
slightly in Germany during January. In Japan, both surpluses (s.a.)
increased during the first quarter but remained below their level of a
year ago. However, in real terms, Japan's external adjustment continued
in the first quarter. Merchandise trade deficits deteriorated in Italy
during the first two months of 1988 and in the United Kingdom during the
first quarter.
Individual country notes. The pace of real economic activity in
Japan remained strong in the first quarter of 1988 after a 6.9 percent
rise in real GNP (s.a.a.r.) and a 10.1 percent increase in total
domestic demand in the fourth quarter. Industrial production grew a
further 3.7 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter, attaining a level
almost 12 percent above a year earlier. Capacity utilization continued
to rise, while unemployment declined to 2.6 (s.a.) percent of the labor
force in March. Other indicators also suggest a tightening of labor
market conditions: the ratio of job offers to applicants rose to 0.88
in February, the highest level since November 1974, and overtime hours

IV-17
remained high. Surveys of investment intentions of large corporations
indicate continued strength of capital spending in 1988, with growth of
investment in the manufacturing sector outpacing that in the non-
manufacturing sector. In contrast, residential investment has been
weakening: housing starts (s.a.) declined for the third consecutive
month in February, but remain considerably above the level of a year
ago. This slowdown in the housing sector is expected to continue
through 1988.
Inflation remains low in Japan. Wholesale prices in the first
quarter were one percent below a year ago, and the Tokyo index of
consumer prices in April was only 0.8 percent above its year-earlier
level. Preliminary indications from the spring wage negotiations
suggest an average nominal wage increase of about 4-1/2 percent, up from
the 3.6 percent gain of the preceding year.
Japan's custom-cleared trade surplus (s.a.) edged up in March to
$6.6 billion from $6.5 billion in February, as nominal exports fell 2.4
percent but imports declined by an even greater amount, 3.9 percent.
The current account surplus for the first quarter was $92.7 billion
(s.a.a.r.) compared with a surplus of $86.6 billion in 1987. Adjustment
in volume terms continues, as import volume rose 6.5 percent (s.a.) in
the first quarter while export volume rose by 3.3 percent.
The pace of money growth remains rapid, with M2+CDs increasing
11.8 percent in March from a year ago after 12.4 percent growth in
February. For the first quarter, the aggregate rose 12.1 percent from a
year earlier, in line with the Bank of Japan's projection of 12 percent

IV-18
growth for the quarter. The Bank of Japan attributed the slower growth
of M2+CDs in March to a decline in M1 and to a shift of funds from
market-determined large denomination time deposits and MMCs to
securities. The Bank of Japan continues to urge restraint in lending by
the major city banks due to concern about the recent rapid growth of
corporate time deposits.
In Germany, growth continued at a moderate pace. In the first
quarter, industrial production (s.a.) was nearly 1 percent above the
fourth quarter, and 4.4 percent above the first quarter of 1987, despite
a decline of 2.5 percent in the preliminary estimate for March. The
unemployment rate (s.a.) increased slightly in March to 8.8 percent, and
remained at that level in April. The volume of domestic and foreign new
manufacturing orders rose again in February and was unchanged in March,
bringing the volume closer to the previous peak set late last summer.
Consumer prices increased in April, rising to a level 1 percent
above a year ago. Producer prices in March were only 0.6 percent above
year-earlier levels. Import prices declined in March to a level 0.3
percent below that of a year earlier.
In January the trade surplus (s.a.) fell slightly to $6.5 billion,
while the current account surplus (n.s.a.) fell sharply to $2.9 billion.
Monetary growth in Germany eased in March to an annualized rate of
5.4 percent (s.a.) over the previous month. However, in March average
M3 stood 7.5 percent above the target base level in 1987 Q4, well above
the 3-6 percent target range.

IV-19
The five economic institutes in Germany revised their consensus
forecast for 1988 to 2 percent (yr/yr) from 1-1/2 percent. They also
issued a forecast for growth in 1989 of only 1-1/4 percent. The
institutes called for an acceleration of tax cuts planned for 1990 and
the elimination of planned consumer-tax increases. In response,
Economics Minister Bangemann and Finance Minister Stoltenberg released a
joint statement asserting that "the best fiscal-policy contribution ...
is the realization of the tax reform in the planned shape and time
frame", i.e., in which the bulk of the tax reduction is in 1990. Only
DM5 billion, of a total of DM39.7 billion (a net reduction of DM20.6
billion), was brought forward into 1988 as part of the Louvre agreement.
In late March, Finance Minister Stoltenberg had indicated that growth in
the first quarter was well in excess of 2 percent. The official
government forecast for 1988 is 2 percent (yr/yr).
In the United Kingdom, industrial production declined in February
by 2.6 percent (s.a.), 0.3 percent above its year-earlier level.
However, officials said that this decline reflected the impact of the
Ford strike. Inflation increased in the first quarter was 2.0 percent
(n.s.a.a.r.), down somewhat from the 4.4 percent rate registered in the
fourth quarter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry reported that the
exceptionally large trade deficits reported for January and February are
partly the result of problems encountered in adjusting to new, EC-wide,
trade reporting rules, and are likely to be revised in the future.
In France, unemployment (s.a.) fell to 10.3 percent in March,
chiefly as a result of temporary retraining programs for youths, and the

IV-20
long-term unemployed. The trade balance (s.a.) deteriorated sharply in
February but then recovered in March, resulting in a first-quarter
deficit of about $0.7 billion, somewhat smaller than the deficit of $1.1
billion in the fourth quarter of 1987.
On May 8, Francois Mitterrand was reelected president winning 54
percent of the vote against Jacques Chirac. President Mitterrand has
announced that he will halt the privatization program, and institute a
wealth tax on the 100,000 wealthiest individuals in France. President
Mitterrand appointed former agricultural minister Michel Rocard prime
minister on May 9, after receiving Chirac's resignation from his post of
prime minister and leader of a center-right coalition. Rocard, who is
on the right of the Socialist Party and has ties to several centrist
leaders, will attempt to form a center-left coalition government that
meets parliamentary approval. If he fails, President Mitterrand is
likely to call new parliamentary elections.
In Canada, industrial production (s.a.) declined 0.4 percent in
February, the first monthly decline since July 1987, while manufacturing
new orders (s.a.) fell 2.8 percent and inventories accumulated. In
addition, retail sales (s.a.) declined 0.9 percent in both January and
February. These trends suggest that there may be some slowing of the
rapid 1987 pace of economic activity. Inflation in the first quarter
increased by 3.2 percent (n.s.a.a.r.), roughly equal to the fourth
quarter rate.
In Italy, a new Government, headed by Christian Democrat Party
Chairman Ciriaco De Mita, received a vote of confidence from parliament

IV-21
on April 23. Economic Policy is unlikely to change significantly,
however, this government should prove to be more durable than its
predecessor.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Completion of an agreement between Brazil and creditor banks is
being held up because of remaining differences over the nature of the
linkage of bank disbursals to an IMF accord and the inclusion of a
clause permitting creditors to seize Brazilian assets before a judgment
has been made. In late March, the Mexican government announced an
extension through May of the freeze on the exchange rate, public sector
prices, and minimum wages as part of its efforts to restrain prices and
wages. President Alfonsin has called for greater adherence to
programmed public sector-budgets as part of an effort to reduce
Argentina's deficit. Ecuador has tentatively agreed to accept a $330
million commercial bank loan, but the country's recently elected
president has said that he will seek to reopen discussions with the
banks in order to obtain a loan that meets expanded financing needs.
Cote d'Ivoire has reached an innovative agreement with banks on a
rescheduling, which may penalize non-participating banks.
Individual Country Notes. Brazil continues negotiating with its
bank advisory committee in an effort to reach a final agreement on a
package that would provide Brazil with approximately $5.2 billion in new
money at a spread of 13/16 over LIBOR, stretch repayment of nearly $62
billion over 20 years, maintain $15.5 billion in short-term credit
lines, and permit a comprehensive menu of financing options including

IV-22
relending, new-money bonds and exit bonds. Brazil is unwilling to
accept two points favored by the banks: direct linkage between an IMF
accord and bank disbursals, and the inclusion of a prejudgment
attachment clause that would permit creditors to seize Brazilian assets
before a judgment had been made.
Brazilian trade surpluses continue very strong, with a surplus of
$1.2 billion for March. March inflation fell to 16 percent owing to
postponed price adjustments. However, April inflation incorporated
these price adjustments resulting in an inflation rate of 19.3 percent.
In an effort to contain the public sector deficit to 4 percent in 1988
and 2 percent in 1989, the government announced a series of measures in
February and April: a ceiling on public sector indebtedness, a two-
month freeze (April and May) on public sector wages, and the elimination
of the consumer wheat subsidy. Brazil held its second debt conversion
auction on April 28. Bidders paid $198 million in debt to obtain the
right to purchase $150 million worth of Brazilian investment.
The Mexican government announced in late March that the freeze on
the exchange rate, public sector prices, and minimum wages would be
extended through May. Also, price increases on private sector goods,
subject to price control, would not be authorized during the freeze.
The government urged businesses and organized labor to continue to
exercise restraint in contractual wage negotiations, and urged the
former to continue to hold down prices of goods not subject to price
control. As a result of the government's efforts to restrain prices and
wages, the CPI increased by only 3.1 percent in April, the smallest

IV-23
monthly increase since June 1985. Interest rate declines continue; the
nominal annual rate on 28-day Treasury bills was 59.2 percent at the
auction of May 3, down from 59.6 percent at the April 26 auction, and
from 88.5 percent on March 15. A key contributing factor to the fall in
rates has been short-term inflows from abroad under the exchange rate
freeze. Although through March the Bank of Mexico continued to make net
sales of Treasury bills in the secondary market, the 12-month rate of
increase of M1 continued to rise, reflecting an inflow of funds from
abroad.
On April 20, the government announced new cuts in budgeted public
sector expenditures. The new cuts amount to 14 percent of the original
budget and are in addition to cuts of 8 percent announced in January.
The new cuts appear to reflect the government's expectation that the
inflation rate will abate more than earlier thought possible during the
balance of the year. However, the freeze cannot be continued for an
extended period without producing adverse effects on the balance of
payments and the budget, and creating difficulties for the management of
monetary policy. Already, the cost of forward exchange cover has risen
significantly since early April, indicating that the authorities must
tread a narrow path as they implement their anti-inflation program.
In a speech on May 1, Argentina's President Alfonsin called for
greater adherence to programmed public sector budgets as part of an
effort to reduce the country's budget deficit. He asked that "realistic
and rational" solutions to the debt crisis be explored, but stated that
unilateral actions are costly and would not provide a solution to the

IV-24
debt issue. The President also spoke out against corruption in the
public sector and indicated his intention to introduce legislation to
limit the Central Bank's ability to provide favored borrowers with low
interest rediscount credit.
Real GDP growth was only 1.6 percent in 1987 (year-end over year-
end), following a 5.4 percent increase in 1986. Inflation has been
accelerating of late; the CPI was 9.1 percent in January, 10.4 percent
in February, and 14.7 percent in March. The removal of price controls
on most goods and services in April has led to a further increase in
inflation to 17.2 percent, but inflation should begin to decline if the
authorities are better able to control the fiscal deficit in upcoming
months in accordance with Argentina's economic program with the IMF.
Preliminary evidence indicates that industrial production in basic
industries (s.a.) rose by about 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 1988
compared with the fourth quarter of 1987. The production of consumer
goods (e.g., beef products, milk, cigarettes) dropped substantially in
the first quarter, primarily due to an ongoing decline in aggregate
demand associated with a fall in real wages in the Argentine economy.
For example, the real purchasing power of industrial wages for the first
quarter of 1988 is about 13 percent below year-earlier levels.
Ecuador tentatively agreed to accept a $330 million commercial
bank loan after protracted negotiations. However, on May 8, center-left
candidate Rodrigo Borja won the election for the presidency and stated
that he would reject this loan and seek a new package that would take
into account Ecuador's expanded financing needs.

Cote d'Ivoire and its bank creditors have decided to move forward
with a financial package involving $150 million in new money and a $2.5
billion rescheduling of debt. The agreement had been delayed while
legal opinions were sought on an innovation that would effectively allow
a debtor country to penalize those banks that refuse to extend new
loans. The Cote d'Ivoire will offer to reclassify all medium-term loans
as debts of a newly created and legally independent vehicle, thereby
replacing former loan agreements with a single new agreement. Lenders
will have to contribute to the new money package for their loans to be
included in the restructuring. All debt originally falling due in 1983-
95 will be repaid over 14 years, including five years grace at LIBOR
plus 1-1/4 percent. New money will be extended to cover 1987 interest
arrears. Those banks that do not provide new money will be given the
option to take exit bonds that capitalize interest and pay a fixed rate
over 20 years. Banks declining to extend new money or take exit bonds
will continue as creditors under the former loan agreements. It is
argued that payments made to participating banks under the new agreement
would not have to be shared with banks that refuse to participate,
thereby evading the clause in previous bank loan agreements that
typically require that any payments made to any bank be shared among all
lenders. However, the legal issues are far from clear.
