created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Available evidence suggests that the economy's strong upward thrust
has carried into the third quarter. The industrial sector continues to
look especially robust, but employment gains in other areas over recent
months also have been substantial. Inflation in the first half of 1988
continued at about the same pace as last year while the employment cost
index pointed to an acceleration in compensation during the first half.
Employment and Unemployment
Nonfarm payroll employment advanced 285,000 in July, and June's
increase was revised up substantially to show a gain of more than
530,000. Coupled with a rise in the average workweek, the strong
employment gains pushed up aggregate hours of production and
nonsupervisory workers 0.7 percent in July to a level 1 percent above
the second-quarter average.
In the payroll survey, hiring in the manufacturing sector looked
especially strong, with an increase of 68,000 in July despite strikes in
shipbuilding and lumber that reduced reported factory payroll growth by
about 13,000. Most of the advance in manufacturing occurred in the
durable goods sector, where further gains in the metals and machinery
industries are consistent with a brisk pace of orders and shipments.
Continued increases in employment in retail trade and services also
contributed greatly to overall payroll growth.
In the household survey, employment was little changed in July
after an extraordinarily large increase in June. The pattern of

employment growth in these two months apparently reflected seasonal
adjustment problems associated with the late June survey week. The
civilian unemployment rate, which was little affected by this seasonal
adjustment problem, edged up 0.1 percentage point to 5.4 percent.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits jumped sharply
to 366,000 in the week ending July 23. Although layoffs in the textile
industry were reported, the sharp pickup in initial claims appears to be
a temporary bulge associated with plant shutdowns for model changeovers
in the automobile industry, rather than any widespread increase in
layoffs. To the extent that model changeovers account for the bulk of
the rise, initial claims should move back down over the next few weeks.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
The available information indicates that industrial production
continued to grow strongly in July. Physical product data indicate that
output of steel, paper and paperboard, and coal rose; however,
assemblies of automobiles declined, and production of light trucks was
unchanged. Production worker hours for total industry, on a Federal
Reserve basis, advanced 0.6 percent in July, the advance reflecting
substantial increases within durable manufacturing (especially
machinery) and widespread gains in nondurable manufacturing, with the
notable exception of apparel.
Industrial production rose nearly 5 percent at an annual rate
during the second quarter, boosted by a 1.1 million unit increase in
auto assemblies. Output of business equipment remained on the rapid
growth track that has been evident for more than a year; gains in

industrial machinery and computers were especially large. Also, there
were strong advances in the output of industrial materials and home
goods, which had shown some weakness earlier in the year. The
production of nondurable consumer goods and construction supplies,
however, was flat in the second quarter after substantial gains in the
first, and the output of defense equipment declined.
The strong output gains for business equipment and related
materials have resulted from sustained strength in both domestic capital
spending and foreign demand and, recently, from a decline in import
penetration. In particular, imports of capital goods other than
computing machines changed little during the first half of this year,
and increases in imports of computers, although still rapid, trailed the
spectacular gains in outlays for domestically produced business
machines.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing rose another 0.4 percentage
point in the second quarter to 83.1 percent, the highest quarterly level
since late 1979; a further increase appears to have occurred in July.
Increases in utilization in the first half of the year were concentrated
in advanced-processing industries, most notably machinery. Even so, the
operating rate for advanced-processing industries is not especially high
on a historical basis. In contrast, utilization rates in primary-
processing industries, which already were high late last year, held
steady at 87 percent during the first half. Among the primary-
processing industries that were tight at the end of last year, the
aluminum, paper, petrochemical, and steel industries remain so.

Utilization in the textiles industry, however, has eased noticeably;
orders for fabric fell below the level of shipments some time ago,
reflecting the weakness in retail sales of apparel and a buildup of
inventories throughout the textile-apparel pipeline.
Agriculture: The Effect of the Drought
The drought intensified in many agricultural regions in the first
half of July and, although intermittent relief has been apparent more
recently, total crop production is certain to be down substantially this
year. Based on the USDA's production estimates of mid-July, the staff
projects real crop losses of a bit more than $10 billion this year.
About half of this drop reflects a sharp reduction in the output of
corn, the main feed crop. A more definitive tally of crop losses will
be possible on August 11, when the USDA is scheduled to release the
first set of production estimates based almost entirely on sampling
actual field conditions. Recent market talk suggests that the
production estimates may be revised down to reflect losses that occurred
after mid-July.
Although the annual crop loss is likely to be small relative to
GNP, the effect on the growth of GNP in the second half may be sizable,
perhaps as much as 1 percentage point at an annual rate in each quarter.
(According to BEA, the drought cut 1/2 percentage point from real GNP
growth in the second quarter.) Assuming that weather conditions return
to normal in 1989, these output losses should be reversed in the first
half of next year, adding noticeably to the reported rate of GNP growth.
The spot and futures prices of agricultural crops have remained
captive to variations in actual and expected weather. On net, prices of

II-8
the main crops--wheat, corn, and soybeans--are well above their levels
of the spring, when concerns about the drought were emerging, but they
have dropped back from the peak levels recorded earlier in the summer.
Futures prices for livestock began to exhibit some effects from the
drought around midyear, when concern about a drought-induced liquidation
of cattle inventories drove down the prices of near-term contracts and
raised the prices of more distant ones. More recently, however, the
prices of near-term contracts have risen, an occurrence that suggests
that traders have become less concerned about near-term liquidation of
herds. In this regard, there are some reports of cattle being shifted
from drought areas to regions where forage is more plentiful rather than
being slaughtered. Also, government subsidies to livestock producers
seem likely to help limit potential liquidation.
Data through June on consumer prices, apart from those for poultry
and eggs, showed little influence of the drought, but greater effects
seem likely to surface in coming months. As shown in the following
table, the droughts of 1980 and 1983 were followed by an acceleration in
overall consumer food prices of about 1 to 2 percentage points in the
year following each of those droughts. At a disaggregated level, the
patterns of price change varied substantially across the two episodes,
presumably reflecting the additional influence of factors other than
drought (for example, differing patterns of wage change, variations in

inventory positions across food industries, alterations in farm policies
for different commodities, and shifting patterns of consumer demand).
The drought also will affect farm income through various channels,
directly through changes in prices and quantities and indirectly through
changes in farm subsidy programs. While the magnitude of these various
effects cannot be forecast with precision, at the aggregate level
farmers' cash flow probably will be well maintained in the period ahead,
as producers take advantage of high crop prices to sell inventories that
had accumulated in years of large production and low prices--a pattern
similar to the one that was evident after the 1980 and 1983 droughts.1
With regard to subsidies, farm "deficiency payments" (income support
payments that, by formula, vary inversely with the level of crop prices)
will be lower in coming quarters than otherwise would have been the
case. However, these reductions will be partially offset by increases
in drought-relief subsidies provided under new legislation that is
expected to be signed into law shortly. Under this legislation, growers
who suffer crop losses in excess of 35 percent will be eligible for
payments that, in effect, will restore a sizable portion of revenue
losses. The bill provides additional benefits to livestock producers
who have suffered losses to the feed crops that they grow. Dairy price
supports are to be boosted temporarily for a period next year.
1. In contrast to cash income, "net farm income," a USDA series that
measures profits from current production, seems likely to fall in 1988,
as it did in both 1980 and 1983. These declines result from valuing
annual production at annual average prices, portion of which already was
history before the drought became a major influence on prices.

II-11
Personal Income and Consumption
Personal income posted a substantial increase in nominal terms in
the second quarter. Wages and salaries moved up briskly, the movement
reflecting both a growth in employment and the pickup in wage rates.
Interest income is estimated by BEA also to have posted another sizable
gain in response to increases in rates earlier this year. After rising
sharply in the three preceding quarters, real disposable income was
about flat in the second quarter; however, this flatness reflects
primarily a transitory surge in tax payments in April associated in part
with the 1986 tax reform and the acceleration in the PCE deflator in the
second quarter. The strength of hours worked in July, as well as a
return of tax payments to more normal levels, suggests that the growth
in real disposable income will pick up again in the third quarter.
Real consumer spending rose at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, a slower pace than in the first quarter, but about the
same pace as the average over the preceding year. Spending on
automobiles and other durables increased sharply, and outlays for
services continued to advance. However, expenditures on nondurable
goods remained weak as spending on apparel dropped further and purchases
of food were essentially unchanged.
Demand for motor vehicles has continued to outstrip most
expectations. Despite some scaling back of manufacturers' incentive
plans, sales of domestically produced automobiles were at an annual rate
of 7-1/2 million units in July, similar to the average pace of the first
half, and sales of U.S.-made light trucks remained robust. The new
plans offer smaller rebates on many models but larger ones on a few of

the less popular makes. Inventory positions at the domestic automakers
are running just above 60-days' supply, which is well within the range
considered comfortable. Accordingly, a major cleanup campaign looks
unlikely this year, and prospects are good that production will be
maintained near current levels. Meanwhile, sales of imported models
weakened in July, as purchases of autos dropped to an annual rate of
2.9 million units and sales of light trucks were little changed at the
reduced rate that has prevailed since early this year.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment rose at an annual rate of 14
percent in the second quarter, with sizable increases for both equipment
and structures.2 Equipment spending remained on the sharp uptrend that
has been evident since early last year, as real outlays for computing
equipment continued to rise at an annual rate of almost 40 percent and
gains in spending on transportation, industrial, and other equipment
also were substantial.
Real outlays for nonresidential construction rose at an annual rate
of 12 percent in the second quarter, the rise offsetting about half of
the drop in the previous quarter. The increase, while widespread, was
especially large for the industrial component, which has been spurred by
the export-led improvement in manufacturing activity. Office
construction has remained surprisingly buoyant in the face of continued
high vacancy rates in many urban areas.
2. The recent revisions of the data on investment expenditures are
discussed in a special appendix on the July revision of the NIPA.

Leading indicators of investment in equipment continue strong.
Orders for computers, which already were at a high level in the spring,
increased sharply in June, while bookings for other equipment generally
have continued to trend up. Unfilled orders for commercial aircraft
have risen markedly and are extremely large; consequently, aircraft
production should continue to rise for quite some time. New contracts
and permits for nonresidential construction, however, declined over the
first half.
Business Inventories
The accumulation of business inventories slowed sharply during the
spring, apparently reflecting the strength in factory shipments, a
curtailment of imports, and efforts by retailers of nondurable goods to
trim excess stocks. The slower pace of stockbuilding damped real GNP
growth in the second quarter, but with ratios of inventories to sales
now lower, inventories are unlikely to be an impediment to--and may be a
positive factor in--production growth in coming months.
Manufacturers' inventories posted only a moderate increase in the
second quarter. Strong factory shipments depleted stocks of finished
goods held by producers of primary metals, fabricated metal products,
electrical machinery, and chemicals. However, stockbuilding at earlier
stages of fabrication remained brisk and contributed to the high level
of capacity utilization and the strong prices in primary-processing
industries this year. Given recent orders and labor market information,

August and reportedly will show substantial revisions in orders for
computers during the first quarter. Monthly changes in the data from
May onward will not be affected by this revision.

the outlook for the expansion of manufacturers' inventories appears
strong.
In the trade sector, the accumulation of wholesale inventories also
has been more subdued in May and June. The deceleration occurred mostly
in the durable goods category, with declines in stocks of motor
vehicles, lumber and construction materials, and hardware. The pace of
sales was moderate in the second quarter so that the wholesalers' ratio
of inventories to sales was little changed from earlier in the year.
Nonauto retail inventories declined an average of $3-1/2 billion
(annual rate) in April and May, after rising $11-1/2 billion in the
first quarter. In particular, inventories at apparel and general
merchandise stores, which appeared excessive earlier in the year, were
pared; nevertheless, ratios of inventories to sales for these stores
remained at high levels because of sluggish sales.
Housing Markets
Housing starts rose 5 percent in June to 1.45 million units at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate, retracing about half of the large
decline in May. A rebound in single-family construction more than
offset a continued falloff in multifamily construction. Issuance of
building permits increased 4 percent in June.
Single-family starts in June bounced back to an annual rate of
1.1 million units after a surprisingly large decline in May. The June
level was about the same as the average for the first four months of
1988, but 3 percent below the 1985-87 average. Home sales recently have

been quite brisk, with new home sales up 8 percent in June and sales of
existing homes at their strongest pace in a year and a half. The spurt
in home sales may reflect, in part, a speedup of purchases timed to
avoid increases in prices and mortgage rates that a growing proportion
of consumers reportedly regard as likely.
In contrast to the rebound in the single-family sector, multifamily
housing starts dropped 8 percent in June to 356,000 units, the lowest
level in six years. The June estimate of multifamily starts, however,
seems to be lower than even the weak fundamentals in this market would
imply. Permits, which typically are measured more reliably than starts,
rebounded in June.
Increases in home prices apparently have continued to moderate. In
the second quarter, the median price of new homes sold was 9 percent
higher than it had been a year earlier, while the median price of an
existing home was up 3 percent. Over the four quarters of 1987, the
advance for median prices of new homes and existing homes respectively
were 17 and 6 percent. Based on data available only through the first
quarter of 1988, some slowing of prices occurred in several large
markets in the Northeast, including Boston and New York, where prices
previously had risen very rapidly. In contrast, price increases
accelerated in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The "constant-
quality" price index of new homes has shown little change over the past
year, a situation that indicates that changes in housing quality and in
the geographic composition of sales accounted for most of the recent
rise in the selling prices of new homes.

II-21
Federal Sector
The federal government recorded a total budget surplus of $9.5
billion in June, compared with a deficit of $22.5 billion in May. The
swing largely reflects seasonal patterns in tax payments--both
corporations and individuals are required to make quarterly estimated
income tax payments in June.4  On the outlay side of the budget,
defense spending continued at a rate that is well above the
administration's budget projections.5  Other noteworthy developments
in outlays in June included a decline in agriculture spending that was
only about in line with recent seasonal patterns (no effects of the
drought were evident) and large net outlays by FSLIC (but not FDIC).
The administration's Mid-Session Review was released late in July.
It showed a deficit of $152 billion for FY1988 as a whole, $5 billion
above the February forecast. An upward revision of about $4 billion in
receipts, largely owing to the greater strength in the economy, was
swamped by technical revisions that raised outlays. Deposit insurance
costs that were higher than anticipated and the postponement of some
anticipated asset sales (counted as negative outlays) were the major
factors that more than offset a net reduction of $3 billion in estimated
4. Beginning with this year, the corporate tax payments will tend to
be concentrated even more in June because the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1987 included a "safe harbor" provision that
allows the deferral of some corporate payments (on current year
liability) from April to June without penalty.
5. On an NIPA basis, however, real defense purchases fell further in
the second quarter and now stand 3 percent below their mid-1987 high. In
the NIPA, much big-ticket defense equipment is not recorded as purchased
by the government until delivery occurs, even though progress payments
previously may have been made--and reflected in the total (unified)
budget. The drop in NIPA-based real defense purchases reflects the
leveling-off or the end of deliveries of several major weapons systems
(B1 bombers and MX missiles) that have been a major part of the military
buildup in the eighties.

agricultural program costs. The estimate of defense outlays in the Mid-
Session Review remains the figure agreed upon in last fall's Summit, and
thus does not reflect the stronger trend in defense spending observed
recently.
The administration now projects a deficit of $123 billion for
FY1989, a projection based on essentially the same policy proposals as
those in the February Budget (including more deficit reduction than in
the Summit agreement); this new estimate is $7 billion lower than
previously projected. Largely as a result of the new economic
assumptions, expected receipts were increased by $9 billion; this gain
was partially offset by considerably higher interest outlays. Technical
reestimates on the outlay side were dominated by a net downward revision
of $5 billion in estimated spending under current law for agricultural
programs (CCC payments $6 billion lower as prices of covered crops rise,
partially offset by higher outlays for credit and crop insurance).
These revisions do not take into account the drought-relief bill that
was just passed by Congress.
The FY1989 deficit on a Gramm-Rudman-Hollings basis was estimated
to be $140 billion, $6 billion below the $146 billion trigger that
determines whether across-the-board budget cuts (sequestration) are to
6. President Reagan has said that he will sign the bill. The reported
budget estimate places the bill's cost at about $4 billion, although it
could well turn out to be higher.
Some other categories of spending were revised upward in the Mid-
Session Review, particularly medical insurance and aid for financial
institutions. An allowance was made in FY1988 for FDIC assistance in
the restructing of First Republic Bank, but it now appears that these
outlays will exceed the allowance. They may be deferred, however, until
FY1989; such a deferral would lower the FY1988 deficit but raise the
FY1989 deficit. The recently signed legislation on catastrophic health
insurance was taken into account on both receipts and outlay sides of
the budget, but the effects are largely in years beyond 1989.

II-24
be invoked. This estimate takes into account authorizing legislation
now enacted and--because 1989 appropriations are not yet in place--this
year's appropriations adjusted for inflation; it excludes the deficit
effects of one-time transactions such as asset sales. The $6 billion
leeway between the current G-R-H estimate and the trigger represents the
margin available for new legislation, including the drought relief bill
as well as any deviation of finally enacted appropriations from the
estimated amounts. This margin will not be affected by subsequent
economic events or budget reestimates of a technical nature.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
are estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 3 percent in the
second quarter, a little below the 3.5 percent rise in the first
quarter. Receipts appear to have advanced more slowly than
expenditures, resulting in a further deepening of the deficit in the
operating and capital accounts (excluding social insurance funds).
State and local deficits have been sizable since late 1986.7  The
deficits have persisted even though many troubled states and localities
have taken corrective measures in the past few years. So far in 1988,
several states have raised taxes, mainly for general sales and motor
fuels. However, these actions are expected to result in a relatively
small increase in revenue--just $600 million, compared with a net tax
7. Although the July NIPA revisions show higher levels of state and
local surpluses in the aggregate, the upward revision was attributable
to larger surpluses in the social insurance funds. The recent operating
and capital accounts deficits appear slightly wider than thought
previously.

increase of $3.3 billion in 1987. Also, a recent survey of city
officials indicated that nearly 60 percent of them had raised fees and
charges for services and almost 40 percent had increased property taxes.
Prices
The rate of price inflation was little changed in June, as declines
in energy prices offset some part of the increase in food costs. The
consumer price index for all urban consumers rose 0.3 percent, the same
as in May. So far this year, the CPI has risen at an average annual
rate of 4-1/2 percent, equal to the pace in 1987 despite marked
differences among components. Producer prices of finished goods were up
0.4 percent in June and 3-1/2 percent over the first half.
The CPI for food rose 0.6 percent in June. Although the effect of
the drought on the consumer's overall food budget was relatively small,
there were some sharp drought-related increases for poultry and eggs.
(The effects of the drought were discussed more fully in the section on
agriculture.)
Retail energy prices edged down 0.2 percent in June, after large
increases in April and May. On net, the CPI for energy has registered
little change so far this year. Despite the increased volatility of
spot prices of crude oil since the announcement of peace initiatives in
the Iran-Iraq War, domestic posted prices remain lower than in late
June, a situation that indicates the likelihood of some near-term
downward pressure on consumer prices of petroleum products.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose 0.4 percent in June,
about the average pace thus far this year. The commodities component

was up only 0.2 percent as apparel prices, reflecting extensive
discounting after their climb earlier this spring, receded somewhat.
Over the first half of this year, apparel prices rose 7-1/2 percent at
an annual rate and were largely responsible for the acceleration in the
CPI for nonfood, nonenergy goods--from about 3-1/2 percent last year to
a 4-1/4 percent rate so far this year. With the major exception of
apparel, import prices rose further from March to June. The March-June
increase in the BLS index for imported consumer goods other than food
was 1.8 percent (not annualized), about the pace observed over the past
8year.
Producer prices of capital equipment were up 0.4 percent in June
for the second month, the rise reflecting large increases for
transportation equipment and some machinery items. Over the first six
months of this year, the PPI for capital equipment has risen at about a
3-1/2 percent annual rate, well above the pace in recent years, likely
reflecting strong domestic and export demand as well as higher dollar
prices of competing imports.
At earlier stages of processing, prices of intermediate materials
less food and energy rose 0.5 percent in June, nearly the average pace
registered over the past year. Prices rose rapidly for metals,
chemicals, paperboard, motors, and electronic components (a category
that includes dynamic random access memory chips, which have been in
short supply). However, declines were registered in some other
categories, notably fertilizers, leather, and glass. Prices of crude
nonfood materials less energy edged up 0.2 percent after declining in
8. These indexes are not seasonally adjusted.

May. This index, which had climbed rapidly last year and in the first
quarter, remained 15 percent above its level a year ago.
More recently, prices have receded in several spot commodity
markets. Among the available domestic measures of commodity prices,
shown in the table, large declines have been posted by the CRB futures
and Dow-Jones spot price indexes, in which agricultural prices are
heavily weighted. Prices also have come down, on net, for some
industrial materials, particularly for copper, aluminum, and rubber,
although prices of steel scrap rebounded. Even after these recent
movements, prices of most industrial metals remain at historically high
levels. Since the week of the last Greenbook, spot prices also have
retreated for precious metals, lumber, and plywood.
The GNP fixed-weight price index accelerated to an annual rate of
4.7 percent in the second quarter, from 3.5 percent in the first
quarter, according to BEA's preliminary estimates. This acceleration
was mainly the result of a sharp pickup in consumer prices of food and
9energy. Prices also rose more rapidly in the second quarter for other
consumer items, most notably the hikes in apparel prices in the early
spring. Averaging over the first half, the GNP fixed-weight inflation
rate has been 4 percent, the same as during 1987. The GNP implicit
price deflator has continued to rise at a considerably slower pace than
the fixed-weight price measure and has mainly reflected compositional
9. The fixed-weight inflation rate for PCE in the second quarter, of
5.4 percent, compares with a 4.9 percent rate for the CPI (based on
quarterly averages, rather than the end-month-of-quarter changes shown
in the table for consumer prices). The higher PCE rate was mainly due
to the food and energy components, for which the PCE and CPI measures
differ in seasonal adjustment and, to some extent, weighting. As can be
observed in the table, divergence between PCE and CPI inflation rates
for food and energy are frequently reversed in subsequent quarters.

shifts, particularly the sharp increases in expenditures on computers,
which have an exceptionally low (1982-based) deflator.
Wages and Labor Costs
Labor costs accelerated in the first half of the year. As measured
by the employment cost index for private industry workers, compensation
rose 4-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in June, about 1-1/4
percentage points more than in the perceding two years. The largest
contributor to the recent pickup in hourly compensation has been benefit
costs, which jumped 6-1/2 percent over the year ending in June, boosted
by the increase in January payroll taxes and by sharply higher employer
costs for health insurance.10  Acceleration also has been evident in
wages and salaries, as the 3-3/4 percent pace registered over the past
year is nearly 1/2 percentage point more than witnessed in 1987.
The acceleration in compensation has been widespread across broad
classifications of workers and across major sectors of the economy; it
has been most apparent in the goods-producing sector--where increases
have been sizable for both manufacturing and construction--and among
blue-collar workers. In the service-producing sector, the acceleration
also has been fairly broad-based, with notable increases in trade and
finance, in which commission payments to sales workers apparently have
rebounded, and in services, in which labor shortages have resulted in
larger pay hikes for health-care workers.
A separate measure of nonfarm compensation, reported in the BLS
10. According to BLS analysts, lump-sum payments, which are included
in the benefit component of the ECI, have risen more than 30 percent
over the past year. However, lump-sum payments are such a small
proportion of overall compensation that they have no significant effect
on changes in the total ECI.

release on productivity and costs, rose 4.1 percent at an annual rate in
the second quarter and was up 4.6 percent from a year earlier, a pace
similar to that of the employment cost index. Productivity in the
nonfarm business sector fell at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the
second quarter, retracing half of a sharp first-quarter advance, and
unit labor costs were up at a 5.9 percent rate after having been little
changed in the first quarter. The fluctuations in productivity this
year reflect large swings in the hours of self-employed workers, which
depressed growth in overall hours in the first quarter and boosted it in
the second. On average, productivity so far this year has risen at
about an annual rate of 1 percent.
In the manufacturing sector, productivity grew 3.5 percent at an
annual rate in the second quarter. Coupled with an increase of 2.9
percent in hourly compensation, the productivity improvements in
manufacturing led to a decline of 0.6 percent in unit labor costs in the
second quarter.
Estimates of productivity and costs have been revised back to 1985
to reflect the revisions to the national income and product accounts and
to the employment data compiled from the establishment survey. The
largest changes were to the figures on compensation per hour, which now
is shown to have continued growing at about 4 percent per year through
1987, in contrast to the sharp deceleration indicated by the earlier
estimates. Productivity growth also was revised up, especially in 1987,
but this change was enough to raise only marginally the staff estimate
of the trend rate of productivity growth, which still stands at about
1-1/4 percent per year. With the revision to productivity falling short

II-35
of the change to compensation, increases in unit labor costs were raised
as well--to 3 percent in 1986 and 2 percent in 1987, compared with
previous estimates of 2 percent and 1-1/2 percent respectively.
In the manufacturing sector, increases in both productivity and
compensation in 1987 were revised up about 1/2 percentage point. As a
result, the decline in unit labor costs remained just below 2 percent.

APPENDIX
ANNUAL REVISIONS TO THE NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS
The annual revisions to the National Income and Product Accounts
were released by the Commerce Department in July. The revision
incorporates new source data and revised estimates of seasonal
adjustment factors for the past three years. On the expenditure side of
the accounts, the changes largely reflect revisions to Census Bureau
data on the trade sector, services, manufacturing, and state and local
government finances. Revisions to the income side of the accounts were
based primarily on information from the state unemployment insurance
system, business income from the Internal Revenue Service, and farm
statistics from the Department of Agriculture.
The pattern of real activity now shows an even sharper acceleration
in 1987 than was previously estimated. Real GNP growth was revised
upward a full percentage point in 1987 to 5 percent, with much of the
adjustment occurring in the first half of last year. In contrast, only
minor changes were made to GNP growth during the two preceding years;
the increase in real GNP in 1985 was revised up 1/4 percentage point to
3-1/2 percent and growth in 1986 was reduced by 1/4 percentage point to
2 percent. Inflation rates were not substantially affected by the
revision. The GNP fixed-weighted price index is estimated to have
picked up to a 4 percent rate in 1987--unchanged from the previous
estimate--after increasing 3-1/4 percent in 1985 and 2-3/4 percent in
1986.
II-A-1

II-A-2
The upward revision to growth in 1987 resulted entirely from a
stronger pace of domestic demand, with essentially no adjustment to the
large gains previously estimated for net exports. About half of the
upward revision to domestic spending reflected somewhat stronger growth
for consumer spending, which now is estimated to have risen 1-3/4
percent. Outlays for food were revised upward considerably, eliminating
the suspicious drop that was indicated by earlier data. Moreover,
service consumption is now estimated to have increased 4-1/4 percent,
about 1/2 percentage point more than previously estimated. However,
even with this revision, consumer spending decelerated sharply last year
from the rapid gains in 1985 and 1986.
Another significant change was a sharp upward adjustment to outlays
for producers' durable equipment, which now show nearly a 10 percent
gain last year. On the basis of a revised series for shipments and new
information showing sharper price declines, the BEA now estimates
that growth in computer purchases was stronger last year. In addition,
some of the exceptional rise in computers that was previously estimated
to have occurred in the first quarter of this year has been moved into
the fourth quarter of 1987 and the second quarter of 1988.
Revisions to inventory investment were small in the aggregate,
though there were sizable changes to the major components. The pace of
nonfarm inventory accumulation was revised up, but with sales also
stronger, the ratio of inventories to sales at year-end was little
changed. Meanwhile, the incorporation of data from the Department of
Agriculture have led the BEA to show a decline in farm inventories in
1987, rather than the accumulation indicated by their previous estimate;

II-A-3
previous estimates had implied an implausibly high level of farm output
last year.
On the income side, the principal upward adjustment appears in
wages and salaries and comes as a result of linking the NIPA series to
the payroll figures collected under the unemployment insurance system.
In addition, net interest and rental income were revised up enough to
offset lower estimates of proprietors' income last year, according to
information taken from IRS tabulations of business tax returns. On
balance, real personal disposable income is now estimated to have
increased 3 percent last year, 1 percentage point more than estimated
initially. Nevertheless, for 1987 as a whole, the upward revision to
the level of consumption was a bit larger than to income, and the saving
rate for 1987 was revised down 0.6 percentage point to 3.2 percent--an
extremely low level by historical standards. Despite the lower annual
average, the saving rate shows essentially the same quarterly pattern as
in the pre-revision data. The saving rate averaged 3.0 percent for the
four quarters before the October stock market break, but has averaged
4.2 percent for the subsequent three quarters.
The level of corporate economic profits was revised up considerably
in late 1985 and 1986, mainly as a result of reestimates of the capital
consumption adjustment, which converts depreciation charges for tax
purposes to an economic measure of depreciation. However, by the end of
1987, the revision to the level of corporate profits was slight, and the
profit share of GNP in recent quarters was little changed. Although the
picture of corporate profitability is not dramatically altered by the
revisions, the contour of the share of profits in GNP has shifted;

II-A-4
rather than remaining flat over the past three years, as indicated by
the previous estimates, the profit share evidently has been drifting
lower.
Before the revisions, there appeared to be a larger decline in
unemployment than could be explained by Okun's Law relationships. In
the last Greenbook, it was argued that this discrepancy most likely
resulted from an underestimate of the level of GNP, but statistical
problems with the household survey or faster growth in potential output
could not be ruled out. As expected, the revisions to output,
particularly in the first half of 1987 where the discrepancy had been
especially large, have brought the Okun's Law prediction of the
unemployment rate (seen in the chart) into better alignment with the
actual unemployment rate.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have continued to trend upward since the last FOMC
meeting, under the influence of surprisingly strong economic activity
and the Federal Reserve's efforts to reduce inflationary pressures.
Much attention was given to Chairman Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins tes-
timony, which was interpreted as emphasizing that inflation concerns
could lead the Federal Reserve to tighten further, a prospect that was
reinforced by incoming information on real activity and wage and price
behavior. The money markets may have firmed somewhat ahead of System
reserve actions; these anticipations, together with some uncertainty
about where federal funds might eventually trade, seem to have con-
tributed to a fairly subdued response in short-term credit markets to
the August 9 hike of one-half percentage point in the discount rate.
On balance for the intermeeting period, short-term rates generally
are up about 1/2 percentage point or more. In long-term markets,
however, rates have risen considerably less, owing in part to a firmer
dollar. Supply conditions also have influenced the pattern of long-term
rate increases: reduced supplies of new corporate and municipal bonds
have held down their yields, while restrictions on the Treasury's long
bond authority have limited the advance in rates on 30-year bonds in
relation to shorter maturities. Among administered rates, banks raised
the prime 1/2 percentage point to 9-1/2 percent on July 14, and mortgage
rates have posted only slight increases.

Expansion in the monetary aggregates slowed a bit in July, with M2
and M3 growing at 4 and 6 percent annual rates, respectively. M1 con-
tinued to advance briskly last month boosted by large inflows to OCDs.
With household deposits in M2 continuing to expand moderately, the
deceleration of M2 owed primarily to declines in overnight Eurodollars
and RPs, the latter of which partly reflected a steep decline in commer-
cial bank holdings of government securities.
Overall private credit expansion appears to have edged off a bit
from its second-quarter pace. Borrowing by businesses apparently fell
sharply in July: gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms slowed
markedly from the elevated June pace, bank loans grew less rapidly, and
commercial paper contracted. In the household sector, mortgage lending
appears to have continued its moderate advance last month, and consumer
lending at banks edged down. Municipal bond issuance in July dropped
back to the level seen earlier this year, and is expected to weaken
further in August. In contrast, federal borrowing is expected to pick
up strongly in the third quarter, reflecting a widening of the budget
deficit from near balance in the second quarter.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 and M3 decelerated slightly in July, but remained in the upper
halves of their annual ranges. The deceleration primarily reflected
weakness in the nontransactions component of M2, which slowed to a
2 percent annual rate of increase. M1 slowed only a little from June,
and continued growing at a strong pace, as a pickup in OCD growth
largely offset a sharp drop-off in demand deposit growth.

III-5
The composition of M2 growth in recent months has been somewhat at
odds with movements in retail deposit rates. Expansion in OCDs and
savings deposits has been higher relative to growth in small time de-
posits than would have been suggested by the wide spreads between small
time and liquid deposit rates. Several factors may be restraining small
time deposit growth. Some households may be temporarily parking funds
in liquid deposits in anticipation of future increases in rates on small
time deposits. In addition, suggested by the strength in noncompetitive
tenders for Treasury securities, others may be shifting into market
instruments, whose rates have been rising relative to small time deposit
rates. Also, small time deposit rates at several large thrifts in the
Eleventh District have not increased as much since May as elsewhere,
possibly owing to pressures exerted on troubled thrifts to price small
time deposits less aggressively.
Expansion of large time deposits picked up in July, boosted by
stronger growth at banks and a turnaround at thrifts. But this rise did
not fully offset the slowdown in M2, and as a result M3 growth
slackened. Reduced sources of funds to banks accompanied reduced uses,
as bank credit expansion weakened to a 4-3/4 percent annual rate last
month. Bank holdings of U.S. government securities, which had risen at
a 13 percent rate over the second quarter, fell at a 17 percent rate,
dragging down growth of overall bank credit last month. Growth in hold-
ings of other securities also slowed somewhat.
Total loans increased at a 9-1/4 percent annual rate, down from
the 11-1/4 percent pace of June, as the volatile security loan component

III-6
contracted and expansion in the other major loan categories decelerated.
Nevertheless, real estate loans continued to expand at a double-digit
rate during a period in which home sales were at their highest level in
more than a year. Consumer loans expanded at just a 4 percent pace in
July, down from 5-1/4 percent in June. The recent slowdown in consumer
borrowing at banks is, however, considerably sharper than these figures
suggest: issuance of consumer credit-backed securities during May and
June removed a large volume of loans from bank balance sheets, but such
issuance was off considerably in July. As shown in the table, consumer
loan growth was about 3 percentage points higher in the second quarter
when these securities are added back, indicating continued strong
consumer lending at banks through June. The slowing in this adjusted
measure of consumer lending at banks last month may reflect, in part,
the scaling back of cash rebate incentives on autos in July.

Business loans at U.S. offices of commercial banks grew at a 13
percent annual rate in July, the fourth straight month of double-digit
growth. Despite the mid-July prime rate increase, the prime-LIBOR
spread narrowed, on average, reducing LIBOR-based borrowing from foreign
offices of U.S. banks in favor of prime-based domestic bookings.
Business Finance
Total borrowing by nonfinancial businesses appears to have fallen
off sharply in July, with most of the decline occurring in bond
issuance. Overall business loan growth--including loans booked at for-
eign branches of U.S. banks--remained relatively robust at a 10-3/4
percent annual rate and continued to be boosted by financings of mergers
and restructurings of nonfinancial firms. But commercial paper of non-
financial businesses ran off at a 21 percent rate, in large part re-
flecting a sizable paydown in late June by a firm that used proceeds of
a divestiture. The sum of commercial paper and business loans grew at a
6-3/4 percent rate, less than half the pace of the second quarter.
Nonfinancial corporate bond issuance declined steeply last month, in
the aftermath of a June surge prompted by lower rates. In view of the
large external financing needs expected by the staff for the third
quarter, the apparent slowdown in overall borrowing last month may
represent only a temporary pause.
Although new announcements and completions of large deals fell off
last month after an extremely heavy June, merger-related funding from
banks remained strong, and issuance of junk bonds continued to run above
the pace of the first half. The weakness of bond supply last month was

instead in investment-grade issues, where offerings were about one-third
their June volume. Average issuance for June and July together was near
the rate of the first half.
The light supply of investment-grade bond issues is likely respon-
sible for some narrowing of their spreads vis-a-vis government bonds.
Since the June FOMC meeting, the spread has narrowed about 1/4 percent-
age point, even as advances in long Treasury yields were being re-
strained by the prospective absence of new bond issues. Broad measures
of corporate-Treasury yield spreads appear to have been unaffected by
recent publicity about losses to some bondholders. Losses suffered by
holders of bonds issued by Revco, which became the first large LBO to
file for bankruptcy, had little apparent effect on the prices of bonds
of other LBO issuers. Nor did the losses of First RepublicBank
Corporation's debtholders appear to nave any major impact on bank hold-
ing company bonds.
Although equity offerings by nonfinancial firms also declined from
the June totals, new stock issuance in July was near the average pace of
the 1980s. The volume of initial public offerings, excluding closed-end
mutual funds, rose to a post-crash high, though it is still 40 percent
below the average for the first nine months of 1987. More generally,
the supply of new issues has been supported by continued high share
prices, which have remained near spring peaks, with price-earnings
ratios still well above those of the 1970s and early 1980s. Over the
intermeeting period, major stock price indexes are down a little, but
remain near post-crash highs.

Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The federal budget deficit is expected to widen to about $40 bil-
lion in the third quarter from near balance in the second quarter. As a
result, the staff projects that net marketable Treasury borrowing in the
third quarter will pick up to $28 billion from $11 billion in the second
quarter, and that the Treasury's cash balance will decline roughly $3
billion, to end the quarter at more than $36 billion. In contrast,
nonmarketable borrowing is expected to fall from last quarter's level as
SLGS issuance continues to be restrained, reflecting a very light volume
of refunding issues by states and municipalities.
The usual 30-year bond auction was not a component of the August
midquarter refunding, because the Treasury had just $1.7 billion in
remaining authority to issue bonds at interest rates above 4-1/4 per-
cent. Although the Senate Finance Committee and the full House have
passed separate tax adjustment bills that include amendments to repeal
the limitation on long bond authority, a final bill is not expected to
reach the President until the fall. To compensate for part of the con-
sequent funding shortfall, the size of each of the two other components
of the August refunding--the three- and ten-year notes--was raised $2.25
billion above the previous refunding to $11 billion. In addition, the
Treasury will issue a $7 billion 248-day cash management bill scheduled
to mature after the April tax date. Apparently, the Treasury decided to
use a longer-term cash management bill to get a start on its consider-
ably larger fourth-quarter borrowing needs, especially given the pos-
sibility that its long bond authority will not be enhanced in time for

III-12
the November refunding. The Treasury also has raised the gross size of
its weekly bill auctions by $800 million, while increases in the one-
year bill and two- and seven-year note auctions have been only $250
million each.
The Financial Assistance Corporation, set up early this year by
Congress to recapitalize the Farm Credit Banks (FCBs), brought its first
offering of bonds to market in mid-July. The $450 million of 15-year
securities, which are fully guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, were priced
to yield 32 basis points above ten-year Treasury notes. Amid concerns
about the effect of the drought on the financial condition of the FCBs,
spreads on their new short-term debenture offerings rose slightly in
July and are now at the highest levels of the year.
In its first public offering since March, the Financial Corpo-
ration (FICO) issued $600 million of 30-year bonds in late July at a
spread of 118 basis points over Treasury bonds. This spread is 14 basis
points above the spread in the March sale, which in turn was up from
previous offerings by about the same amount. The deterioration in the
spread coincides with adverse publicity about the FSLIC and the
savings and loan industry, which has raised investor concerns about both
the credit risk of the bonds and the potential for significantly larger
supplies. More recently, FICO issued $250 million of debt in a private
placement, thereby exhausting its $3.75 billion issuance authority for
its fiscal year ending this month.

III-13
Municipal Securities
After a surge to nearly $14 billion in June, gross offerings of
long-term municipal debt fell back in July to $8 billion, about the
average for the first five months of 1988. The drop-off largely
reflected a very weak volume of refunding issues, which were at their
lowest monthly level since January 1986.
Yields on long-term municipal bonds have been quite steady over
the intermeeting period, and as a result, the ratio of the Bond Buyer
yield to the 30-year Treasury fell to .89 in early August, down from .91
at the time of the last FOMC meeting and .92 at the beginning of this
year. The recent decline in supply probably has held down increases in
municipal rates.

Mortgage Markets
Total mortgage lending volume in the second quarter picked up a
bit from the reduced first-quarter pace while remaining moderate by the
standard of recent years. One-to-four family mortgage debt, which ac-
counts for about two-thirds of all mortgage credit outstanding, expanded
at about a 10 percent annual rate in the second quarter despite a flat
dollar volume of new home construction. Home mortgage borrowing was
boosted by heavier resale activity. Adjustable-rate mortgages continued
to account for a little more than half of all conventional loans
originated for home purchase.
Mortgage investment by thrift institutions accounted for much
of the pickup in overall mortgage debt growth in the second quarter.
S&Ls and savings banks provided more than 40 percent of all mortgage
funds advanced, up from an unusually low 10 percent share a quarter
earlier. Sizable increases were posted in holdings of both loans and
securitized mortgages. More ARMs are being securitized--spurred by new
programs at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--and depository institutions
presumably are carrying some of their ARMs in this form to enhance their
value as collateral for borrowings. About half of the unsecuritized
mortgages bore fixed rates, in contrast to previous quarters in which
all of the net additions to thrift loan portfolios bore adjustable
rates.
Interest rates on fixed-rate home loans are up only a few basis
points from their level at the time of the June FOMC meeting. The
spread over Treasuries of comparable maturity has remained historically

narrow (top panel of chart). The narrower spread reflects reduced in-
terest rate volatility, and consequently lessened prepayment un-
certainty, as well as strong demand for CMO collateral, which has
boosted demands for pass-throughs and, in turn, primary mortgages.
In the primary market, the typical spread of rates on conven-
tional loans over those on FHA loans has nearly vanished this year
(middle panel), owing partly to developments in the secondary market,
into which almost all FHA mortgages and a large share of conventional
mortgages are sold. Since early 1987, Freddie Mac participation
certificates--backed by conventional mortgages--have been trading at
yields lower than those on GNMA pass-throughs--issued against FHA and VA
mortgages (bottom panel). Because GNMAs are backed by the U.S. govern-
ment while the FHLMC securities carry only the corporate guarantee of
Freddie Mac, differential credit risk alone should cause investors to
require a higher return on the FHLMC pass-throughs. However, other
factors, including changing expectations of prepayment rates, have in-
creased relative yields on GNMAs since early 1987. Moreover, increased
demand for FHLMC and FNMA pass-throughs as collateral for CMOs has
pushed these yields down even further relative to GNMAs. Recently, over
a third of all CMOs have been issued by FHLMC and FNMA, and these in-
stitutions now use only their own pass-throughs as collateral.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit expanded at a 10 percent annual
rate in June, bringing growth for the second quarter to 8 percent.
Commercial banks accounted for most of the June pickup, and by type of

credit, revolving credit increased the most rapidly. The second-quarter
pace of installment credit growth, while down from that of the first
quarter, remained more rapid than last year's rate.
The generally firmer pace of installment borrowing this year
has been accompanied by weakness in noninstallment consumer credit,
leaving total consumer credit expansion about 2 percentage points below
the growth of installment credit alone. One factor at work is a sub-
stitution away from single-payment loans and toward home equity lines
and unsecured personal lines of credit (the latter of which is clas-
sified as installment credit). These revolving plans give the borrower
more flexibility than single-payment loans.

Suppliers of consumer credit have been broadening their own
sources of funding in recent months through securitization of consumer
loans. Banks have been particularly active lately in securitizing
credit card receivables, raising $2 billion by that means in the first
half of 1988. As shown in the table, this is nearly twice the pace of
last year, when the first card-backed offering was made. In June alone,
banks securitized $1.4 billion of credit card receivables, and in July,
Banc One Corporation entered into an agreement with a Merrill Lynch
subsidiary to sell the subsidiary up to $1.0 billion in receivables.
Bank One, as is typical in such arrangements, will continue to service
the credit card accounts.
Until last year, only auto loans were securitized, but credit-
card issues have become more popular, and the first offerings backed by
"other" consumer loans have been made. Consumer-loan securitizations
totaled $25 billion from 1985 through the first half of 1988, of which
about $18 billion is estimated to be outstanding currently, representing
about 3 percent of total consumer installment credit outstanding.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. Merchandise Trade
In May, the seasonally adjusted U.S. merchandise trade deficit was
$10.9 billion (Census basis, CIF valuation), compared with a $10.3
billion (revised) deficit in April. The deficit increased as imports
rose slightly more than exports (see table below). Data for June will
be released on August 16.

For the combined April-May period, the trade deficit was
substantially less than that recorded in the first quarter; exports rose
and imports declined. These data, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
and on a balance-of-payments basis, are shown in the table on the next
page in both current and constant 1982 dollars.
In constant dollars, the rate of growth of nonagricultural exports
in the April-May period (8 percent from the first-quarter level) was
close to the strong rates recorded during the previous four quarters.
In current dollars, total exports in April-May rose 5 percent from the

first quarter level. The strongest increases were in agricultural
products (especially corn and wheat to the Soviet Union), civilian
aircraft, automotive parts (about half of the rise was to Canada),
telecommunications equipment, lumber, fuels, metals, and various
consumer goods. Partly offsetting these increases were declines in
exports of a wide variety of machinery (particularly generators,
engines, construction machinery, agricultural machinery, and computers).

The volume of nonoil imports dropped by 4 percent in April-May from
the first-quarter level and prices (discussed below) rose. In terms of
value, the decrease was 3 percent with the decline widespread among
trade categories. Areas showing significant declines included foreign
cars (especially from Japan and Germany), consumer goods (particularly
apparel, and TVs and VCRs), non-oil industrial supplies (especially
copper, steelmaking and steel mill products, lumber, and textile
supplies), machinery (other than semiconductors), and foods
(particularly meat). The only significant offsets to this widespread
decline in imports were strong increases in imports of semiconductors
(which are in short supply in the domestic economy), civilian aircraft
(several airbuses were delivered), and oil.
The volume of oil imports rose in both April and May, with imports
in the two-month period growing at a 5 percent higher rate than in the
first quarter. The rise in imports occurred as abnormally large
inventory accumulations offset the slowdown in consumption. Conditions
in world oil markets continued to be volatile as fluctuations in the
volume of production by OPEC countries led to price changes. While

prices of imports rose by about 80 cents per barrel from April to May,

IV-4
Import and Export Prices
Prices of both imports and exports (as measured by BLS and shown in
the upper part of the table that follows) increased more rapidly during
the second quarter than in recent quarters. Much of the acceleration
was attributable to a surge in prices of oil, other industrial supplies,
and grain.
Prices of imported industrial supplies other than oil jumped 22.8
percent (at an annual rate), with particularly strong increases in
metals and agricultural products. The price of imported oil also rose
strongly in the second quarter, following sharp declines in the previous
two quarters. Prices of imported capital goods rose at a 7 percent
annual rate, marginally stronger than in the first quarter. Excluding
computers, the rise in prices of other imported capital goods was
slightly slower than in the first quarter, particularly for electric
machinery, telecommunications equipment, and scientific equipment --
each of which showed strong increases in the previous two quarters.
Prices of imported consumer goods (particularly apparel) and automotive
products also rose at somewhat slower rates than in previous quarters.
Prices for imported foods, feeds and beverages were virtually unchanged
during the second quarter, following four quarters of moderate
increases.
Prices of agricultural exports jumped substantially during the
second quarter, primarily due to sharply higher prices for grains; over
the year ending in June, these export prices rose 17 percent. Prices of
exported industrial supplies also rose strongly, particularly prices of
fuel oil, metals, plastic materials, and inorganic chemicals. In

contrast, prices of exported capital goods, consumer goods, and
automotive products all registered increases of under 3 percent at an
annual rate.
Other measures of prices of U.S. imports and exports -- the
implicit deflators and fixed-weighted price indexes reported in the GNP
accounts -- showed smaller increases in prices of imports and exports in
the second quarter than the BLS series (see the bottom half of the
table). The GNP data differ substantially from BLS data due to
different treatment of prices of agricultural products, industrial
supplies, aircraft exports, and especially imports and exports of
computers. Even after revisions to take into account additional data
(which will probably result in a small upward revision to non-oil import
prices), the GNP price measures are likely to continue to show
substantially smaller increases in overall prices of imports and exports
through the second quarter than the BLS data.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
The increase in foreign official reserve assets held in the United
States was large again in May, $7.7 billion. (See line 4 of the Summary
of International Transactions Table.)
.OPEC reserves continued to fall.
However, partial information from FRBNY indicates substantial
net declines in official assets held by G-10 countries in June and July.

Germany, in particular, facing strong downward pressure on the foreign
exchange value of the mark, reduced its holdings at FRBNY by about $9
billion during these two months.
Private foreigners made net purchases in May of both Treasury
obligations ($3.3 billion, line 3) and U.S. corporate securities ($2.1
billion, lines 2a plus 2b). In the first category, residents of Japan
accounted for purchases of $0.8 billion, with another $0.9 billion
coming from World Bank transactions. Foreigners sold corporate stocks
again net ($2.2 billion), after the year's first strong month of
purchases in April (line 2b). Similarly, U.S. residents sold foreign
stocks net (line 2c). In contrast, there were significant net purchases
of corporate bonds in May of $4.3 billion (line 2a); this coincided with
a pick-up in new Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations in April ($2.1
billion) and May ($1.6 billion). In June, new bond issues by U.S.
corporations in both the Euro and domestic bond markets were even
stronger; however, the volume fell sharply in July, probably as a result
of higher interest rates.
Banks reported a small net outflow in May of $2.4 billion, after
massive inflows in April (line 1). The monthly average of daily data on
the net claims position of U.S. banking offices with their foreign
affiliates and IBFs gives a considerably different picture of the
changes in May -- a net inflow of $9.5 billion. (See line 1 of the
International Banking Table.) The discrepancy between the two series is
largely accounted for by the particular daily pattern of the net claims
data. Data for June through July 23 suggest that net banking claims were
essentially flat for the period: a small capital outflow for June and a

International Banking Data Table).
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the June FOMC meeting, the weighted-average foreign-exchange
value of the dollar against the other G-10 currencies has appreciated
nearly 4 percent, as shown in Chart 1. The dollar rose sharply in mid-
July in reaction to U.S. trade data for May, which prompted continued
optimism about external adjustment. These gains were subsequently
eroded amid perceptions that Germany, Japan, and the United States were
intervening in a concerted fashion to contain the dollar's rise
The dollar moved higher late in the intermeeting period as
additional U.S. economic data showed stronger-than-expected employment
and spending, and then shot up to within nearly 2 percent of last
summer's peak after the Federal Reserve raised its discount rate.
Among individual currencies, the dollar appreciated 1 percent
against the yen and the Canadian dollar, and somewhat more against
sterling. The mark weakened sharply, falling 5-1/4 percent against the
dollar, and hit a post-war low against the yen. Furthermore, the mark
depreciated even as interest rates on mark-denominated assets increased
substantially
Although the German economy certainly is less buoyant than other major
economies outside of continental Europe, German economic data released
during the intermeeting period generally were better-than expected.

IV-11
Short-term interest rates worldwide generally rose during the
intermeeting period, but the increase was most pronounced in Europe.
Three-month interbank rates in the United Kingdom -- shown in the panel
at the bottom of the chart -- climbed 130 basis points, as the Bank of
England boosted its money market dealing rates 150 basis points to
10-7/8 percent, bringing the total increase since early June to 350
basis points. In Germany, three-month rates moved up 85 basis points.
The Bundesbank raised its discount and Lombard rates 1/2 percentage
point each to 3 and 5 percent, respectively, and increased its RP rate
in three steps a total of 3/4 percentage point to a level of 4-1/4
percent. This followed a 1/4 percentage point rise in mid-June. The
Swiss National Bank raised its Lombard rate and the Austrian National
Bank raised its discount and Lombard rates in tandem with the
Bundesbank's moves. Dutch and Belgian authorities hiked key money
market rates about 3/4 percentage point. Notable exceptions were the
Bank of France and the National Bank of Denmark, which cut official
money market rates slightly early in the period.
Elsewhere, three-month interest rates moved up 45 basis points in
Canada and about 10 basis points in Japan. The Bank of Japan allowed
the two-month commercial bill buying rate to rise 3/16 percentage point
during the intermeeting period, bringing the total increase since mid-
May to 5/16 percentage point. U.S. CD rates have climbed nearly 60
basis points since the June FOMC meeting.
For longer maturities, yields on 10-year Treasury bonds in the
United States are up more than 35 basis points since the last FOMC

In a non-market transaction, the Desk
purchased $1-1/2 billion equivalent of yen from the Japanese Ministry of
Finance, under an agreement between the Treasury and the MoF to
replenish U.S. reserves of yen. According to this agreement, U.S.
authorities are scheduled to purchase an additional $1/2 billion
equivalent of yen during the rest of August. Proceeds from all Desk
activity were split about equally between the System and Treasury
accounts.
Developments in the Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity appears to have slowed in most of the major
foreign industrial countries in the second quarter. Industrial
production declined slightly in both Japan and Germany after strong
first-quarter growth. In France, the level of industrial production in
April and May was down slightly from the first quarter's pace while in
Canada the rate of expansion continued to be moderate. In contrast,

IV-17
industrial production increased sharply in the United Kingdom in both
April and May, and in Italy in April. Inflation remained low abroad,
but has increased somewhat in recent months in some countries, the
United Kingdom and Canada in particular.
Compared with the same period last year, the cumulative net trade
surplus of the major foreign industrial countries is lower in 1988.
Cumulative trade surpluses in Japan, and Canada have been reduced, while
cumulative trade deficits in the United Kingdom and Italy have
increased. In contrast, in France, the cumulative trade deficit has
improved considerably so far this year, while the trade surplus in
Germany has increased slightly.
Individual country notes. In Japan, the pace of real economic
activity appears to have slowed in the second quarter from the
exceptionally strong growth of previous quarters. Industrial production
fell nearly 1/2 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter after a sharp
increase in the first quarter. Nevertheless, the index in the second
quarter was 10.6 percent above last year's level. Despite the slower
growth of output, signs of labor market tightening persist. In June,
the unemployment rate fell to 2.4 percent (s.a.), the lowest since
November 1982, while the job-offers-to-applicants ratio rose to its
highest level in 14 years. A sign of weakness was a decline in housing
starts of 4.7 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter. In contrast,
consumer spending continued to expand, with retail sales increasing
about 2-1/2 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter.

IV-18
Consumer price inflation remained low but increased slightly
compared with last year. In July, the Tokyo index of consumer prices
(n.s.a.) rose 0.8 percent above last year's level after being 1/2
percent higher in the two preceding months. Wholesale prices in the
second quarter continued to stand below their year-earlier level, but
less so than in the first quarter.
Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus (s.a.) rose sharply in July
to $6.2 billion, bringing the cumulative surplus for the first seven
months to $75 billion (s.a.a.r.) compared with a surplus of $79.5
billion for 1987 as a whole. The July surplus was the first year-on-
year increase in 15 months. Japan's trade surplus with the United
States in the first seven months of 1988 was $4 billion lower than
during the comparable period last year. Imports from the United States
grew 21 percent while exports to the United States increased only 4
percent. The current account surplus declined in June for the fifth
consecutive month to $5.2 billion, bringing the cumulative total for the
first half to $81.6 billion (s.a.a.r.) compared with a 1987 surplus of
$87 billion for the year as a whole.
The pace of Japanese money growth has slowed in recent months. The
broad aggregate M2+CDs grew 11 percent from a year earlier in the second
quarter, down from 12 percent in the first quarter. The Bank of Japan
attributed the slowdown to a decline in cash and deposits and to
sluggish growth in housing and other real estate-related loans.
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the opposition parties
reached agreement on the personal income tax reductions for this year

IV-19
and the Diet has passed a compromise plan. The number of income tax
brackets will be reduced from 12 to 6; with tax rates ranging from 10 to
60 percent, retroactive to January 1988. The range of tax rates is
little changed from the present system, but the compression in tax
brackets, along with an increase in the minimum taxable income for
workers doing contract work at home, will result in a total income tax
reduction of 1.3 trillion yen ($10 billion) this year. The Cabinet has
submitted to the Diet for consideration the remainder of the tax reform
package, including the introduction of an indirect tax due to take
effect next April.
Economic activity in Germany slowed in the second quarter after a
surge of activity in the previous quarter. Industrial production
increased 1.8 percent (s.a.) in June, after several months of weakness.
Even with this sharp increase, the level of production in the second
quarter was slightly below the first-quarter's pace. This weakness was
also reflected in labor markets, with the unemployment rate remaining at
8.9 percent (s.a.) in June, unchanged from the jobless rate in April and
May. The volume of total new manufacturing orders increased about 1
percent (s.a.) in June. Domestic orders rose 1 percent, and foreign
orders increased 0.7 percent.
Consumer prices declined 0.1 percent (n.s.a.) in July bringing
inflation for the seven-month period ending in July to 1.7 percent
(a.r.). Consumer price inflation was slightly less than 1 percent
measured from July 1987, however. Wholesale prices increased 0.9

IV-20
percent (n.s.a.) in June, and were 1.2 percent above last June's level.
Import prices (n.s.a.) in May were 2.1 percent above a year earlier.
The trade surplus increased in May to $6.1 billion (n.s.a.)
bringing the cumulative surplus to $26.8 billion, slightly larger than
last year's surplus over the comparable period. The current account
surplus declined in May to $4.5 billion (n.s.a.), bringing the
cumulative surplus to $18.2 billion, compared with a surplus of $19.9
billion over the comparable period in 1987.
Growth in the average monthly level of M3 in June was 7.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.). The average level of M3 in June stood 7.5 percent above the
target base period of 1987-Q4, exceeding the target range of 3 to 6
percent.
In early July, the government announced its budget for 1989 and
projected a budget deficit of DM32 billion (about 1.5 percent of GNP),
down from the 1988 deficit of DM39.7 billion. Included in the 1988
deficit projection was a supplementary budget making up for a decline in
Bundesbank profits and greater payments to the EC totalling DM9.7. The
projected 1989 deficit is lower than originally planned, though the
reduction falls short of earlier assertions that the 1989 deficit would
be reduced by the amount of the 1988 overrun to DM30 billion. Also in
July, the German parliament approved the government's 1990 tax reform
bill after a compromise was reached by the ruling coalition party
regarding federal subsidies to some of the economically distressed
states.

IV-21
In the United Kingdom, mounting evidence of economic overheating
has prompted authorities to raise official interest rates seven times by
a total of 3-1/2 percentage points since the beginning of June.
Industrial production and the value of retail sales have recorded strong
increases recently, and the unemployment rate declined for the 23rd
consecutive month in June, falling to 8.4 percent. The 12-month rate of
consumer price inflation rose to 4.6 percent in June and is expected by
British authorities to continue to rise for another year. The trade
deficit in June was only slightly below the record high level of the
previous month. For the first half of the year, the cumulative trade
deficit was $29.1 billion (s.a.a.r.), substantially above the $11.3
billion deficit in the first half of last year.
Preliminary data indicate that French economic activity proceeded
at a moderate pace in the second quarter of 1988. Principal French
commercial banks lowered their base lending rates for the first time in
more than 2 years in response to the government's lowering of
intervention rates and some jawboning by Finance Minister Beregovoy. In
July, the newly formed French cabinet agreed on two bills that would
institute a wealth tax, similar to the one abolished two years ago, and
establish a new minimum social income for the poorest households. This
legislation is quite controversial, and is expected to generate heated
debate in the National Assembly this fall.
In Italy, the cabinet approved revenue measures to reduce the
projected 1988 state sector budget deficit by $5.7 billion to reach the
target of 11 percent of GDP. Roughly half of this revenue will result

IV-22
from adjustments to value added tax rates to bring them into line with
those proposed by the European Commission as part of the 1992
liberalization program. In addition, the Cabinet approved a spending
freeze through the end of the year.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
The syndication of Brazil's financing package among foreign
creditor banks is proceeding following the recent IMF Executive Board
approval of a new stand-by arrangement and the completion of a Paris
Club rescheduling. Argentina recently announced a new package of
economic measures aimed at reducing the public sector deficit and
stemming inflation. The Mexican anti-inflation program is approaching a
critical stage as price and wage distortions increase and the peso
continues to appreciate in real terms. In response to declines in
foreign exchange reserves, Venezuela is seeking external credits.
Ecuador suspended negotiations with commercial banks in regard to a $350
million loan agreed to last October.
Individual country notes. At the end of July, the IMF Executive
Board approved in principle an SDR 1.2 billion stand-by arrangement and
the Paris Club rescheduled $3.9 billion in principal and $1.1 billion in
interest for Brazil. The Paris Club rescheduling covers principal
arrears from January 1987 through July 1988, as well as 70 percent of
interest due and all principal due between August 1988 and March 1990.
Also, end-July, Brazil received from the BIS and U.S. Treasury a $500
million loan to bridge to the first two tranches from the IMF stand-by.
Commitments to the commercial bank new money agreement reached more than

IV-23
90 percent of the $5.2 billion total by August 8, spurred in part by the
incentive of an early participation fee of 3/8 of a percent of the
amount each bank committed by August 5. Banks that commit financing
between August 5 and September 2 receive a 1/8 of a percent fee.
Consumer prices rose 24 percent in July, following increases of 20
percent in June and 18 percent in May. The demand for dollars also
continued to intensify during July. The spread between the parallel and
official dollar rates has increased steadily since February, rising from
about 25 percent to almost 50 percent at present. The trade surplus
continues to run at a record rate, reaching $1.8 billion in June. The
surplus for the first six months of 1988 was $8.6 billion, compared with
$3.5 billion for the same period in 1987.
On August 3, Argentina announced a new package of economic measures
aimed at reducing the public sector deficit and stemming inflation.
These included: an increase in public sector tariffs and fuel prices of
30 percent on average; a 10.5 percent devaluation of the commercial
exchange rate; the implementation of a new exchange rate for industrial
exports that is the average of the commercial exchange rate and the
financial exchange rate; the reduction of the value-added tax from 18 to
15 percent; the freezing of prices at their August 2 levels until August
15, after which prices can be raised 1.5 percent during the second half
of August and 3.5 percent in September; increases of public sector wages
by 25 percent to be followed by a two-month freeze; and the
implementation of twice daily auctions of foreign exchange by the
central bank to smooth fluctuations in the financial or free-market
austral/dollar exchange rate. In support of these measures, the U.S.

IV-24
Treasury announced August 4 that it would help to arrange a loan of up
to $500 million consisting of BIS and U.S. Treasury funds to bridge to
future World Bank policy loans. Argentina's stand-by arrangement with
the IMF is presently inoperative; negotiations toward a new stand-by are
continuing.
Inflation accelerated from an average monthly rate of 13 percent
over the first quarter of 1988 to an average of 19 percent in the second
quarter. Tax receipts over the first seven months of 1988 were 7
percent below the same period last year in real terms, despite the
passage of new revenue measures by Congress in January. Argentina's
trade surplus totalled $578 million in the first four months of 1988, up
from $345 million a year earlier.
Since last December, the CPI in Mexico has risen by over 40
percent, while minimum wages have been raised by only 24 percent. The
CPI increase occurred even though public sector prices and some private
sector prices were frozen at that time, and even though import barriers
have been sharply lowered and the peso/dollar exchange rate has changed
little in the past seven months. As a result of the weaker showing by
the government party (the PRI) in the July 6 general elections,
pressures to relax the wage freeze are increasing.
The trade surplus is continuing to shrink. In May, it was less
than $500 million, the lowest since July 1986, and about half as large
as in June 1987. Imports exceeded $1.5 billion, the highest level since
March 1982, and were 56 percent higher than in May 1987, while exports
were only 6 percent higher than a year earlier. Non-petroleum exports
in May 1988 were 17 percent higher than last year at that time, but oil

IV-25
exports were 9 percent lower, owing to weaker oil prices. International
reserves turned down in May and continued to fall in June and July. The
reserve drain in these three months was about $4.5 billion. In addition
to the shrinking trade surplus, the drain reflects capital flows
stemming from uncertainty arising from the elections and their outcome
and nervousness regarding future exchange rate policy. Also, the
relative attractiveness of Mexican financial instruments deteriorated
when nominal interest rates in Mexico declined this spring. Since early
June, when the decline in these rates stopped, the return on Mexican 30-
day bank promissory notes, adjusted for the spread between the buying
and selling rates for dollars, has been less than the return on a one-
month CD in New York.
Venezuela's liquid operating foreign exchange reserves stood at
$2.5 billion in mid-July, a decline of $300 million since mid-June and
$1 billion since the end of 1987. In response to this loss of reserves,
Venezuela is seeking new short-term trade credits, exporting non-
monetary gold to raise $300 million this year, and issuing new
international bonds. The government also intends to seek new money from
banks this year, but is not requesting a formal reopening of the amended
rescheduling agreement that became effective in November 1987.
After slowing sharply from an average monthly rate of 2.9 percent
in 1987 to an average rate of 0.4 percent in the first five months of
1988, CPI inflation rose to 5 percent in June. The spread between the
free-market and official exchange rates has been widening in recent
months. After nine months of relatively stability at about 30 bolivars
