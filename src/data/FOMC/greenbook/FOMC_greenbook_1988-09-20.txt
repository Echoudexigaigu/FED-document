DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Sorting through the volatile monthly data, there are some hints
that the anticipated mild second-half deceleration in economic activity
may be in train. Meanwhile, there has been little evidence of a change
in underlying wage and price trends.
Employment and Unemployment
Nonfarm payroll employment rose about 220,000 in both July and
August, on a strike-adjusted basis. While below the extraordinarily
rapid pace of the first half, these are nonetheless strong gains,
amounting to 2-1/2 percent growth at an annual rate, a figure well in
excess of what can be sustained by underlying trends in labor force
growth. On balance this year, increases in payroll employment have
exceeded considerably the growth in employment recorded in the household
survey; the gap constitutes something of a puzzle at this point,
although it likely reflects, at least in part, an increase in multiple-
job holders.
In July and August, the pace of hiring at trade and finance and
services establishments and at contract construction sites slowed
considerably. In addition, manufacturing employment edged down 5,000
last month, after posting four months of large increases. While
small declines were widespread, there were increases in the machinery,
electrical equipment, and chemical industries, where domestic and export
sales have been strong. The average workweek in the private nonfarm

down to 45,000.

sector dropped back last month, and coupled with the employment gains,
resulted in a decline in aggregate hours of production and
nonsupervisory workers. Nonetheless, the July-August average of
aggregate hours remains almost 3/4 percent above the second-quarter
level.
In the household survey, the civilian unemployment rate rose 0.2
percentage point to 5.6 percent in August, returning to its May level.
Increases in unemployment rates of around 1/2 percentage point were
recorded for adult men and teenagers, while rates for adult women and
young adults were essentially unchanged. Although the decline in
manufacturing employment in the payroll survey was small, in the
household survey the unemployment rate in manufacturing rose 0.4
percentage point, probably accounting for much of the increase in
unemployment for adult males. Together, the decline in aggregate hours
and the higher unemployment rate suggest somewhat more moderate GNP
growth for the third quarter than the staff had anticipated in the last
forecast.
Since March, the civilian jobless rate has hovered at a level about
equal to its 1979 low, after falling almost 1-1/2 percentage points
over the preceding year and a half, suggesting considerable tightening
of labor markets. However, in assessing the extent of tightness, an
evaluation of alternative measures of labor market conditions is useful.
The Conference Board's index of national help-wanted advertising also
suggests that current labor market conditions are similar to those that
prevailed in 1979. This index was at its peak in 1979, and after

II-4
falling sharply through the early 1980s has now risen to its 1979 level.
Further corroborating evidence is provided by data from a Bureau of
National Affairs survey of personnel managers, showing that strong labor
demand has led to shortages in some occupations. The percentage of
firms reporting that production or service jobs are difficult to fill
has about doubled since the beginning of 1987, to 13 percent, while the
percentage reporting difficulties in filling clerical jobs has moved up
from 8 percent at the end of 1986 to 12 percent in the second quarter of
this year.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Total industrial production is estimated to have risen 0.2 percent
in August after a sharp increase in July; the level of output in August
was about 6-1/2 percent above the second-quarter average, at an annual
rate. Output of business equipment rose at a slower rate than earlier
this year, as strong gains in manufacturing equipment (including machine
tools) were offset by a second month of weak output of computers.
Production of consumer goods increased moderately, driven by a
substantial rise in residential electricity generation--owing to
unseasonably warm temperatures--and a rebound in assemblies of light
trucks. Auto assemblies were little changed last month, while output of
clothing continued weak. Among materials, output of basic metals and
chemicals rose further in August, while production of paper and textile
materials, parts for consumer goods, and coal declined.
Total industrial capacity utilization was little changed in August.
Although the operating rate at utilities moved up sharply owing to

unusually hot weather, the utilization rate for manufacturing edged down
after four consecutive months of increases. Since last December,
capacity utilization in manufacturing has increased about 1-1/4
percentage points to approximately 83-3/4 percent--midway between the
average operating rate during the 1967-87 period and the peak rates
posted between 1978 and 1980.
The rate for advanced processing industries leveled off at 82.1
percent in August and now stands about 2 percentage points above the
rate at the end of last year. A principal contributor to this increase
has been nonelectrical machinery, where utilization dropped back in
August, but still has climbed more than 4 percentage points this year.
Primary processing industries have been operating close to capacity
throughout this year, and the utilization rate in August was 87-3/4
percent. This high rate has been associated with reports by purchasing
managers of price increases for a number of important industrial
materials, such as various chemicals, paper, aluminum, steel products,
and plastic resins, that continue to be in short supply.
Agriculture
Additional drought losses in August appear to have been relatively
slight, as the Agriculture Department's September crop report showed
only small revisions in the production estimates for most crops. Based
on conditions as of the start of September, the agency is projecting
that U.S. production of corn will total 113.4 million metric tons this
year, compared with a projection of 113.8 million metric tons in August.
The estimate for wheat, at 49.3 million metric tons, was revised down

II-7
slightly from a month ago, while the projection for soybeans was
virtually unchanged. For all three of these crops, the 1988 harvest
will be substantially below that of a year ago, reflecting markdowns
that were reported in the July and August crop data. Large year-to-year
declines also are apparent for a number of other feed crops; in
contrast, production of several other crops--including cotton, peanuts,
tobacco, and sugar cane--is expected to be about the same, or somewhat
higher, than a year ago.
With the current growing season beginning to wind down, market
focus in agriculture is likely to shift more to the demand side in
coming months. At present, the USDA generally is projecting that this
year's price runup for farm crops will result in only small reductions
in domestic and foreign use and that, consequently, most of the
production shortfall will be reflected in a steep drawdown of
inventories. By the end of the current marketing season, stocks of the
major crops are expected to be much tighter, relative to consumption,
than has been the case in recent years. Crop prices, therefore, are
likely to remain sensitive to changing market conditions over the next
few months.
Based on the August crop report, the Commerce Department had pegged
agricultural losses from this year's drought at about $14-1/2 billion,
consisting of $13 billion in crop losses and $1-1/2 billion in livestock
losses (all figures in 1982 dollars). Given the September crop report
it appears likely that the BEA figure will be revised only slightly.

II-8
Personal Income and Consumption
Personal income growth was strong in July, led by a jump in wages
and salaries of nearly $25 billion--about 12 percent at an annual rate.
This increase may be revised down, given the downward revision in
payroll employment in July, but the trend in income growth clearly has
remained robust. With farm income falling, total nominal disposable
personal income moved up at about the same rate as in the first half of
the year.
August retail sales will be released on September 15, along with
the usual revisions for the prior two months. At this point, consumer
spending in July is estimated to have been about flat, but given an
especially large gain in June, was more than 2 percent (annual rate)
above the second-quarter average. Consumption of durable goods other
than motor vehicles, which had risen appreciably in the first half, is
estimated to have dropped 1 percent in July, and outlays for nondurables
remained sluggish. In contrast, spending on services has remained at a
high level, boosted by the effect of hot weather on outlays for
electricity. Meanwhile, recent survey data indicate that consumer
confidence has improved; the Conference Board index moved up last month
and the Survey Research Center's index rose appreciably in August,
reaching the highest level in more than two years.
Autos and Trucks
Sales of new cars and trucks remained at relatively high levels in
August. Domestically produced autos sold at a 7.3 million unit annual
rate last month--a healthy pace, although down a bit from the average

over the first seven months of the year. Meanwhile, sales of domestic
and foreign light trucks surged to a 5.2 million unit pace--the fastest
monthly selling rate on record for these vehicles. In contrast, sales
of imported cars remained at the relatively low rate of 2.9 million
units.
A major factor in the near-term outlook for autos is the relatively
comfortable level of dealer inventories, which have made major end-of-
model year incentive efforts unlikely. This contrasts with the pattern
of the past three years in which auto production outstripped sales for
much of the model year. This left dealers with excessive stocks near
the ends of model years, leading to massive year-end incentive programs
that created dramatic fluctuations in sales. This experience now weighs
heavily in the FRB seasonal factors, which expect a speedup in sales in
August and September, followed by a steep decline in October, reflecting
the "payback period" that typically accompanied the end of the incentive
programs. Thus, sales in August probably were understated and in
September will be artificially weak on a seasonally adjusted basis,
while October and November may appear strong.
Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for business equipment continued to expand in July,
although at a pace well below the 20 percent annual rate posted in the
first half of this year. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods
rose to a level 1-1/2 percent above the second-quarter average.
2. Because BEA's seasonal factors have shifted less in response to
this recent behavior, sales data adjusted on a BEA basis should more
accurately reflect underlying activity.

However, shipments of office and computing equipment, which are
magnified in importance in the translation to real terms owing to their
low deflator, fell in July and remain at about their second-quarter
3average. As a consequence, the recent robust quarterly increases in
computer purchases probably will not be repeated in the current quarter,
although advances are still expected. Looking ahead, orders for
nondefense capital goods continue to show gains, though once again not
at the exceptional pace posted earlier in the year. Excluding aircraft
and parts, the July level of orders was up 1-3/4 percent from the
second-quarter average, and appears consistent with some deceleration in
equipment outlays in the second half.
Recent indicators of real spending for nonresidential construction
have been mixed. Petroleum drilling activity, as measured by the number
of rigs in use, showed renewed declines in July and early August, after
a temporary upswing in the second quarter. In contrast, construction
put-in-place, which covers all nonresidential structures except oil and
gas wells, rose in July to a level about 3/4 percent above the second-
quarter average.
The composition of building activity has been somewhat surprising
in recent months. Industrial construction, after rising strongly in the
3. As expected, the annual revision to the Census M3 data last month
smoothed the pattern of shipments of office and computing equipment, but
the average growth rate over the past year and a half was little
changed.
4. The initially reported figures for nonresidential construction put-
in-place are subject to large revisions. Indeed, the latest report
substantially weakened nominal June spending, and we expect a downward
revision to second-quarter nonresidential construction of about $2
billion in constant dollars.

II-15
spring, has fallen back in recent months, even as factory utilization
rates have continued to rise. Meanwhile, the level of office building
has been well maintained this year, in the face of high national-average
vacancy rates. As shown in the chart, the six-month moving average of
the value of new construction contracts--a broad indicator of future
building--has generally trended down since the beginning of this year,
suggesting that outlays will show little improvement into 1989. The
chart also shows that the decline in contract awards has been widespread
among the major components of nonresidential construction.
The latest Commerce Department survey of business plans for plant
and equipment outlays indicates a 10.6 percent rise in nominal outlays
this year, with particular strength expected in the manufacturing
sector. These plans, which were collected in July and August, were
similar to those reported in the spring survey.
Business Inventories
Nonfarm business inventory accumulation slowed quite a bit in the
second quarter. Manufacturing and trade inventories rose (in constant
dollars) at an annual rate of $19 billion in the second quarter,
compared with a $40 billion rate in the first quarter. Current-cost
data for July indicate that inventory investment remained moderate in
the manufacturing and wholesale sectors.
The slowing in the second-quarter stock accumulation was most
notable in the non-auto trade sector. For wholesale and retail
establishments other than auto dealers, inventories in constant dollars
were little changed during the second quarter, compared with a $34.3

billion runup from January to March. Lower levels of imports in the
second quarter, and relatively flatdomestic production of home goods
and consumer nondurables earlier this year, suggest that the reduced
pace of inventory investment reflects efforts on the part of retail and
wholesale establishments to control stockbuilding. The slower
accumulation has helped to stem the rise in inventory-sales ratios at a
few types of retail stores--in particular, apparel and general
merchandise--where those ratios reached historically high levels earlier
this year.
In the manufacturing sector, inventory investment also slowed in
the second quarter; with production strong over that period, however,
the slowing may have been unintended. The recently revised constant-
dollar data show that inventories at all stages of processing in the
manufacturing sector were low relative to shipments at mid-year.
Inventory-related indicators for the industrial sector--the high level
of new factory orders, the backlog of unfilled orders, and relatively
low inventory-shipments ratios for most major industries--suggest that
stockbuilding could pick up a bit, particularly in those industries in
which production remained strong through August.
Housing Markets
Housing starts rose 2-1/2 percent in July to a 1.49 million unit
annual rate, owing entirely to a rebound in multifamily construction
from the low June level. Single-family starts, at 1.08 million units,
were little changed and matched the average pace of the first half of

the year. However, mortgage interest rates moved up in August, and some
weakening of demand for single-family homes can be expected.
New and existing home sales fell approximately 5 percent in July
from the surprisingly high level recorded in June, to a level more in
line with single-family starts. Sales in the single-family sector in
July appeared generally consistent with mortgage market conditions
during the early summer and recent assessments of market conditions by
consumers and builders.
In the multifamily sector, starts strengthened in July to about
410,000 units at an annual rate, a pace close to the average for the
year to date. At its current rate, multifamily construction remains 40
percent below the annual average of 650,000 units during the 1984-86
period. This falloff accounts for nearly all of the decline in total
housing starts in the past two years, from an annual average of almost
1-3/4 million units in the 1983-86 period to an annual rate of 1-1/2
million units thus far in 1988. Apart from the less favorable tax
climate for residential income properties, the multifamily rental
vacancy rate has remained at an historically high level, holding down
potential profitability.
In contrast, the pace of single-family starts has remained close to
the levels of the mid-1980s. Household formations, which averaged 1.4
million units annually over the 1983-87 period, underpinned overall
building activity. Moreover, single-family construction was stimulated
by gradual improvements in housing finance costs and housing
affordability, which released demand pent up from the previous housing

II-21
downturn. That pent-up demand probably had dissipated by the first half
of 1988, but housing finance costs and affordability levels were more
favorable than in much of the 1983-87 period.
Looking ahead, the coming of age of the "baby bust" generation
should result in a slowdown in the overall rate of household formation,
to 1.2 million by 1990. Abstracting from macroeconomic developments,
the projected decline in young adult households implies continued weak
demand for multifamily units over the next several years. However,
continued household growth among those aged 30-54 should help bolster
the demand for single-family homes, all else equal.
Federal Sector
The total deficit for the current fiscal year through July was
essentially unchanged from the same period of FY1987. The deficit for
FY1988 remains uncertain, however, because of differences in special
factors affecting the budget at the end of the fiscal year.
In FY1987, receipts in September were boosted by the expiration of
a "safe harbor" that had allowed corporations to defer some estimated
tax payments from earlier in the year. This year, a more limited safe
harbor for corporate payments concentrated corporate receipts in June,
and no special boost to September receipts is expected.
On the outlay side, spending in late FY1987 was reduced by the
concentration of asset sales and loan prepayments in September, as well
as shifts in the timing of some expenditures. In FY1988, asset sales
are being distributed more evenly throughout the fiscal year, and there
are no other special shifts in the timing of outlays.

II-23
However, the recent flurry of actions by the FDIC and FSLIC to
restructure bank and saving institutions is adding substantially to
outlays; the spending is in the form of either direct cash assistance or
the issuance of agency notes--both of which are recorded as outlays in
the budget. How many of these restructurings will be completed by the
end of this month, and their exact cost, remains a major source of
uncertainty for FY1988 deficit calculations. On the other hand, the
effect of this summer's drought on CCC loan activity may reduce
expenditures in late FY1988; high grain prices have made it advantageous
for farmers to repay CCC loans, permitting them to reclaim their crop
collateral and to sell the crops in the open market.
Turning to FY1989, the Office of Management and Budget's
preliminary sequester report, issued on August 25, projects a deficit of
$144 billion for the coming fiscal year, on a Gramm-Rudman accounting
basis. This is slightly less than the $146 billion trigger that would
force automatic spending cuts to reduce the deficit to the $136 billion
Gramm-Rudman target. The recent OMB figure differs from the projection
published at the time of the Mid-Session Review of the Budget primarily
because of the addition of the estimated $3.9 billion cost of the
Drought Relief Bill enacted in early August. OMB will issue its final
sequester report on October 15. It will take into account the
additional legislative and regulatory actions taken by that date, but
5. Much of the legislation implementing the 1989 budget must still be
enacted; to date, only two of the thirteen regular appropriation bills
that fund discretionary programs have been signed by the President.
However, action in Congress on the remaining bills is well advanced and
(Footnote continues on next page)

II-24
is required by law to use the same economic and technical estimating
assumptions as the preliminary report.
In contrast to OMB's estimate, the CBO's update of the Economic and
Budget Outlook and an advisory sequestration report, issued on August
19, projects a Gramm-Rudman baseline deficit of $153 billion for FY1989.
The CBO deficit estimate is higher than OMB's estimate because of less
favorable economic assumptions and different technical estimating
assumptions for some programs.
State and Local Government Sector
State and local government spending appears to have expanded on
balance so far in the third quarter. Employment rose 50,000 in August,
nearly offsetting the large decline in July. Real outlays for
construction increased 5 percent in July, the largest monthly advance
since January 1986, and now stands 2-1/2 percent above the second-
quarter average.
Spending on the two largest components of state and local
construction--highways and educational facilities--is 10-1/2 percent
higher for the first seven months of the year than for the comparable
period last year. In the case of highways, total motor vehicle
registrations relative to miles of paved roads continue to increase,
suggesting growing pressures to expand and repair roads and bridges.
Demands for expanded educational facilities have apparently followed the
changes in the number of school-age children, shown in the chart.
(Footnote continued from previous page)
thus far appears consistent with the outlay estimates used for the
sequester report.

Births fell from the late 1960s into the mid-1970s, but they began to
rise sharply in 1977, leading to crowded classrooms in the early grades.
These cohorts will be followed by even larger ones, as in 1987 births
reached their highest level in 24 years.
Prices
The consumer price index for all urban consumers rose 0.4 percent
in July. The CPI for food jumped 1 percent, after a 0.6 percent
increase in June. Much of the July runup in food prices appears to be
weather-related, led by hikes for poultry, eggs, and fruits and
vegetables. Large increases also were recorded for cereal and bakery
products, fats and oils, and other processed foods, but meat prices were
down. The PPI for crude foods was up another 2.2 percent in August, the
fourth month of large increases. More recently, spot commodity prices
have moved up further for cattle and crops. These developments suggest
continued upward pressures on retail food prices in the near term.
Energy prices were up 0.3 percent in the July CPI, mainly
reflecting higher gasoline prices. Moreover, refinery prices of
gasoline rose sharply in both the July and August PPI. However,
domestic crude oil prices fell 12 percent from May to August, and
gasoline prices are likely to turn down in coming months, as lower crude
oil costs are passed through to the pump.
Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices rose 0.3 percent
for goods and 0.4 percent for services in July, about the average pace
over the preceding twelve months. In the goods component, large
increases for cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, and household cleaning and

paper products were partly offset by a decline for clothing. Apparel
prices, which had risen sharply in the spring, dropped back in both June
and July, as merchants made larger end-of-season markdowns than usual in
response to generally sluggish demand. Nevertheless, apparel prices
have risen more than 5 percent above their level a year ago, and further
increases are likely this fall.
At the producer level, prices of consumer goods other than food or
energy rose 0.3 percent in August, after increasing nearly 1 percent in
July. Capital equipment prices edged up in July and rose 0.4 percent in
August. The PPI for intermediate materials less food and energy rose
0.7 percent in July and 0.4 percent in August, as these prices remained
on the sharp uptrend that has been evident over the past year. Prices
of crude nonfood materials less energy, which receded in the second
quarter, posted sizable increases in July and August.
However, since the pricing date for the August PPI, movements in
spot commodity prices have been mixed. Among industrial materials,
prices have firmed for copper, tin, and zinc, but have come down for
steel scrap, aluminum, and cotton. Prices of precious metals have been
little changed. As seen in the table, the available domestic commodity
price indexes also have registered mixed and relatively small net
changes.
To provide a longer-term perspective on recent inflation rates, the
accompanying chart shows 12-month changes in major CPI and PPI series
(excluding food and energy items) from 1985 through the most recent
reporting period. For nearly all of the indexes, an acceleration of

II-31
prices is evident. The clearest pattern of price acceleration has
occurred at the intermediate level. Prices of intermediate materials,
which had been flat or declining in 1985-86, have accelerated sharply
since then, affected by high levels of capacity utilization and tight
world markets. This index has risen more than 7 percent over the past
year. At the finished goods level, domestic producer prices had shown
little sign of acceleration until early this year, when price increases
picked up for a wide range of goods. The latest 12-month increase in
this PPI series is 1 percentage point above the increase for the
preceding year. The CPI for commodities, which slowed markedly in 1985-
86, picked up to the 3-1/2 percent pace during 1987 and, on average, has
remained at that pace over the course of this year. This pattern was
associated in part with the lagged effects of movements in the exchange
value of the dollar on retail prices of imported goods. In contrast,
service price inflation has been roughly flat over the past year.
Wages and Labor Costs
Few additional labor cost data have become available since the last
Greenbook. As shown in the chart, available measures for the first half
of 1988 show some pickup in the four-quarter rates of increase in wages
and compensation. The hourly earnings index for production and
nonsupervisory workers was up 0.1 percent in August, bringing the rise
in the index to 3.1 percent over the past year--about 1/2 percentage
point more than in the preceding 12-month period. In addition, revised
6. The 1985-86 rates also were held down by steep declines in prices
of used cars, which had a large weight in the CPI before the 1987
revision.

data show that nonfarm compensation per hour--as reported in the
productivity and cost data--rose about 4-1/4 percent at an annual rate
in the second quarter. For the four-quarter period ended in the second
quarter of this year, nonfarm business compensation per hour rose 4-1/2
percent, while unit labor costs advanced nearly 3 percent; both of these
measures are rising more rapidly thus far this year than in 1987. A
similar pickup is evident in the manufacturing sector, where hourly
compensation rose at a 3 percent rate in the second quarter, and 3-1/4
percent over the past year. With productivity growth of 2-3/4 percent,
unit labor costs turned up slightly for the four quarters ending in
1988-Q2 after declining 1-1/4 percent over the preceding four quarters.

APPENDIX 1
A NEW MEASURE OF DISCRETIONARY FISCAL POLICY
The Board staff is presenting for the first time a new budget
measure of discretionary fiscal policy, dubbed FI (for fiscal impetus).
This new measure has been developed to help interpret the role of
federal budget developments in the short-run path of aggregate
demand. It is premised on the view that such a fiscal indicator
should be derivable from a macroeconomic model. The model provides
guidance in the selection and weighting of various aspects of federal
sector behavior, as they influence aggregate demand.
The macroeconomics literature offers several competing models with
widely differing implications about the short-run effects of fiscal
policy. For example, models exist in which it is theoretically possible
for tax cuts to increase, decrease, or not affect GNP. However, FI has
been derived from a simplified model of aggregate demand determination
in a growing economy that attempts to capture essential elements of the
staff's judgmental GNP projection framework and of the Board's MPS
quarterly econometric model. In this model, a tax cut does, indeed,
increase GNP, especially when the cut is judged to be permanent.
By combining information about discretionary tax and spending
changes (with appropriate weighting), FI essentially quantifies the
magnitude of the shift in the IS curve attributable directly to fiscal
actions. Indeed, a positive value for FI indicates that fiscal policy
is, ceteris paribus, increasing GNP growth.
The new discretionary measure, FI, is similar to the change in the
high-employment budget deficit, the traditional summary measure of the
stance of discretionary fiscal policy, because it excludes cyclical
influences on taxes and spending. However, FI differs from the change
in the high-employment budget in some important respects. For example,
FT excludes interest payments on the debt, fiscal drag, and built-in

issues relating to the new fiscal measure, see Darrel Cohen, "Models and
Measures of Fiscal policy," Economic Activity Section Working Paper
Series, No. 70. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March
1987.
3. FI (in constant dollars) is given by, AG-1 b.AT., where AG is the
discretionary change in real government spending, AT. is the
discretionary change in real taxes of type i, and b. is the coefficient
weight associated with tax i (e.g., for personal taxes b is the marginal
propensity to consume). To express FI in its derived percentage form,
the above expression is divided by the level of discretionary real
government purchases.
II-A-1

trends in spending (e.g., demographic trends in social security).
Furthermore, FI measures discretionary spending and tax changes in real
terms, weights various tax and spending changes differently, and
evaluates them at actual -- rather than at high-employment -- levels of
economic activity. Moreover, in line with the life-cycle model of
consumption, FI gives substantially less weight to temporary tax changes
(such as the one-time tax rebate in 1975, the temporary tax surcharge in
the late 1960s, or the early-1987 surge in capital gains tax receipts
that resulted from tax reform) than to permanent ones (such as the tax
rate reductions enacted in the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act).
A comparison of the key properties of FI and the change in the
high-employment budget is presented in table 1. FI (expressed as a
percent of discretionary government purchases) and the change in the
high-employment budget (expressed as a percent of nominal potential GNP)
are shown graphically for the period, CY1971 to CY1987, in the chart.
Underlying data (both on a quarterly and calendar year basis) for the
1980s are presented in table 2.
4. For example, the personal income tax rate changes resulting from
tax reform receive a coefficient weight of 0.7, while the repeal of the
investment tax credit receives a coefficient weight of 0.5.
Furthermore, discretionary changes in government purchases (such as
defense) and transfer payments (such as those resulting from
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings cutbacks) each receive a coefficient weight of
unity; transfers receive the same weight as purchases because the
marginal propensity to consume out of transfer income is 1.0 in the MPS
model.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Federal funds have continued to trade around the 8-1/8 percent
level established shortly after the August 9 discount rate hike. Most
other market interest rates have fallen noticeably on balance since the
last FOMC meeting, the declines amounting to as much as 3/8 percentage
point. Much of the drop occurred in response to the less robust August
employment report, which, combined with weakness in oil and other
commodity prices, was perceived by many as lessening the prospects for a
near-term firming in monetary policy.
In response to the upward trend in interest rates over recent
months, growth of the broader monetary aggregates slowed a bit further
in August, with M2 and M3 growing at annual rates of 2 and 4 percent,
respectively, while M1 was flat. From the fourth quarter of 1987
through August, M2 expanded 6-1/4 percent and M3 grew 7 percent, placing
the two measures well within the FOMC's annual ranges.
Overall credit demands have continued to ease from the second-
quarter pace, leaving debt growth, too, comfortably inside the 1988
monitoring range. Net borrowing by nonfinancial businesses apparently
remained subdued in August as a small pickup in bond offerings was
accompanied by a slowdown in business loan growth at banks. In the
federal sector, Treasury net borrowing from the public has picked up
seasonally in the current quarter. Borrowing by state and local
governments remains moderate, reflecting a dropoff in offerings of bonds
for new capital as well as very light issuance of refunding bonds.

Available data on the household sector suggest some slackening
in the pace of mortgage and consumer debt expansion.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The slower growth in M2 last month reflected a sharp deceleration
in M1 that more than offset a small pickup in its nontransaction
component. Within M2, overnight RPs and Eurodollars rebounded while
retail accounts weakened, likely reflecting higher market interest rates
and opportunity costs. The slower M2 expansion and some weakening in
its non-M2 component accounted for the deceleration in M3.
In August, the composition of growth in the retail-type components
of M2 appears to have become more consistent with recent movements in
interest rates. Small time deposits, which in June and July had posted
unusually weak growth in view of the widening gap between their own
rates and those paid on liquid accounts, picked up to an 8 percent
annual rate last month, while growth in savings deposits and MMDAs
weakened further. There appears, however, to have been a significant
change recently in both the growth and pricing of small time deposit
accounts at thrift institutions relative to those at commercial banks.
Over most of the five-year period since the deregulation of small time
deposit rates, thrifts had priced more aggressively than banks and
consistently had experienced stronger growth in these deposits. In each
of the past three months, however, small time deposit growth at thrifts
has been unusually weak and markedly below that of commercial banks.

III-4
Recent data suggest that the spread between thrift and bank rates
paid on 6-month retail CDs had fallen by August to less than half its
first-quarter level and was the narrowest on record. While the falloff
in growth of thrift small time deposits could simply reflect in part a
shifting into bank deposits, it may also represent a source of weakness
in overall growth of small time deposits and M2, to the extent that the
previous high rates had attracted funds from market instruments.
The non-M2 component of M3 slowed in August as growth in large time
deposits eased somewhat. A moderate runoff in large CDs at thrift

institutions, apparently largely concentrated in the Dallas Federal
Reserve District, contributed to the slower growth in aggregate large
time deposits. Institution-only money market mutual funds and term RPs
continued to decline last month, while term Eurodollars surged.
Commercial banks increased their borrowings from foreign branches
last month to fund a mild pickup in bank credit to a 6-1/2 percent
annual rate of growth. The strengthening of bank asset growth reflected
an increase in holdings of U.S. government securities, after a decline
in July. Total loans increased at a 7-1/4 percent rate, down somewhat
from July; a drop in business lending was partially offset by a strong
turnaround in the volatile security loan category, some strengthening in
real estate lending, and faster growth of consumer loans. Consumer
loans on bank balance sheets continue to be affected by the issuance of
consumer credit-backed securities. Adjusting for this activity,
consumer loan growth last month was roughly 8 percent, about 3
percentage points above the comparable July figure, but still noticeably
below its second-quarter pace.
Growth of business loans at U.S. offices of commercial banks fell
to a 1-1/2 percent annual rate last month, with the slowdown evident at
both large and small U.S.-chartered banks and at U.S. offices of foreign
banks. Booking of loans at foreign branches of large U.S. banks picked
up, likely reflecting shifts from prime-based domestic bookings to
LIBOR-based loans at foreign offices as the prime-LIBOR spread widened
last month after the increase in the prime rate.

Business Finance
Total borrowing by nonfinancial businesses in August evidently
continued around the reduced pace registered in the preceding month.
Commercial paper of nonfinancial corporations increased in August, after
a steep decline in July, but the sum of commercial paper outstanding and
overall business loan growth at banks expanded at only a 4 percent
annual rate, down somewhat from July and substantially below the pace of
the second quarter. Gross public bond offerings picked up somewhat,
though they remained low relative to the average pace earlier in the
year. To some extent, the recent slowdown in the growth of business
debt likely reflects the dropoff in the volume of share retirements so
far this quarter from the record totals in the spring. Few acquisitions
or leveraged buyouts have resulted in equity retirements of a billion
dollars or more since June. Nonetheless, there have been numerous
smaller deals, which, along with a continued excess of share repurchases
over new issues, have kept net retirements somewhat above their average
pace of recent years, at roughly a $100 billion annual rate.
This continued restructuring activity has helped support a large
flow of junk bond financing. New bonds rated below investment grade
have been flowing into bond portfolios at an average rate of $3 billion
a month since early 1986, except for last fall and winter after the
stock market crash. Some investors withdrew from the junk market during
1. One uncertainty in the assessment of business borrowing develop-
ments is the lack of data on private placements. Market reports suggest
that private placement activity has been heavy, but there is no basis
for judging whether recent levels have differed from those in earlier
months of the year.

that period, but as the stock market stabilized and the economy's
prospects brightened, demand for new issues rebounded and is evidenced
by the narrowing to pre-crash widths of yield spreads vis-à-vis
Treasuries. Demand for high-yield debt increasingly has been augmented
by indenture clauses limiting further leveraging in any subsequent
restructuring, and by assurances that future interest costs on some
of the floating-rate bank financing are hedged by interest rate caps or
swaps. The recent legal difficulties of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the
dominant underwriter of junk bonds, reportedly have had little net
effect on the market as a whole.
In contrast to the moderate rebound in bond issuance, new equity
offerings fell off sharply in August. The decline in stock prices early
in the month likely discouraged some issuers. Currently, share price
indexes are a little above their levels at the time of the August FOMC.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The outlook for the federal sector has changed little since the
August FOMC meeting. The federal budget deficit is projected to widen
to $39 billion in the third quarter, after ending the second quarter
roughly in balance. For the fiscal year as a whole, the deficit is
projected at roughly $158 billion. The staff expects the Treasury to
finance its current-quarter deficit mainly by borrowing $42 billion,
net, from the public. Net marketable borrowing of $33 billion is
expected to be split about evenly between bills, which had been running
off in previous quarters, and coupon issues; other special borrowing

(mostly FSLIC notes described below) is expected to contribute $6
billion toward financing the current-quarter deficit. Considerable
uncertainty remains as to whether the Treasury will have the authority
to issue 30-year bonds in the November refunding. A technical
corrections bill for the 1986 tax legislation, which contains a
provision to repeal the limit on the authority, has yet to be taken up
by the full Senate.
In spite of the publicity surrounding liquidations and mergers of
financially troubled savings and loan associations, the rate spread of
Financing Corporation (FICO) obligations over Treasury bonds has
narrowed about 15 basis points since the last issue was brought to
market in late July. In the last two months, the FSLIC has greatly
accelerated the pace at which it is resolving thrift insolvencies, and
Chairman Wall of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has testified that he
expects this rapid pace to extend through September. Despite the
issuance of more than $2-1/2 billion of FICO bonds this year, the
FSLIC's cash resources have not been adequate to provide the financial
assistance necessary to complete these transactions. The FSLIC instead
has relied on the issuance of adjustable-rate obligations (FSLIC notes)
to augment its resources. By the end of August, FSLIC notes outstanding
had reached $9.3 billion, compared with $5 billion at the beginning of
2this year. The issuance of large amounts of FSLIC notes has
attracted considerable attention from the public and Congress and has

raised further concerns about the ability of the insurance fund to
handle the remaining insolvencies without additional financial
assistance.
The improvement in the FICO spread has been attributed to enhanced
demand associated with stripping of the FICO securities by several
dealers to form zero coupon issues; there has been no stripping as yet
of the most recent 30-year Treasury bond. Spreads of Federal Home Loan
Bank securities over Treasuries have remained relatively stable over the
summer, while spreads on Farm Credit System securities, which had
widened somewhat earlier in the summer, were unchanged to down slightly
at the System's last offering in late August. The yield on the 15-year
bond issued by the Financial Assistance Corporation, which was
established earlier this year to provide aid to the Farm Credit Banks,
has risen slightly relative to the 10-year Treasury rate, reportedly
owing to a lack of liquidity in the issue.
Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term tax-exempt securities slowed to $6-1/2
billion in August and is expected to remain light in September. The
August long-term volume reflects a dropoff in offerings of bonds for new
capital, combined with a continued weakness in issuance of refunding
bonds. By contrast, short-term issuance surged to $5-1/2 billion last
month, with about $3-1/4 billion accounted for by the state of
California. As has been the case since last winter, long-term tax-
exempt yields have continued to be remarkably steady compared with other

III-13
bond rates. The tax-exempt to taxable ratio has remained low by the
standards of recent years.

Inflows to tax-exempt bond funds in the first seven months of 1988
have been running somewhat behind the pace of a year ago. Unit
investment trusts, however, have been active purchasers of municipal
bonds, with inflows of about $4.7 billion thus far, up roughly 20
percent on a year-over-year basis. The rebound in UITs is consistent
with reports of demands by individual investors for municipal securities
as shelter from taxes and stock market volatility.
Mortgage Markets
Residential mortgage lending activity appears to have diminished in
July, as rising mortgage interest rates have contributed to a slowdown
in sales of new and existing homes. The volume of mortgage loans closed
at FSLIC-insured thrift institutions fell to a seasonally adjusted $19.3

billion in July. Refinancings as a proportion of loans closed at
thrifts declined to 16 percent, the lowest share since 1985, while new
commitments to originate mortgages dropped to a seasonally adjusted
$18.5 billion. A decrease in originations of fixed-rate mortgages,
which are more likely to be passed through to the secondary market, led
to a decline in thrift sales of mortgages into the secondary market and
thus to a net increase in mortgage assets.
In primary markets, mortgage interest rates are little changed, on
balance, from their levels at the time of the previous FOMC meeting.
Reflecting the sizable initial rate advantage of ARMs in recent months,
the proportion of conventional mortgages closed with adjustable rates
has continued its upward trend, increasing for the fifth consecutive
month to 61 percent in early August. Lenders evidently have priced ARMs
more aggressively during recent months, in attempts to attract borrowers
to ARMs and to raise market share. Although the overall prevalence of
ARMs closed with initial rate discounts has been fairly stable of late,
the proportion of ARMs at FSLIC-insured lenders carrying discounts in
excess of 2 percentage points has risen steadily this year, to a
historically high level of almost 40 percent in July (see chart on page
III-16). The trend toward deep discounting of ARMs also is reflected in
spreads between initial ARM rates and common benchmarks. The difference
between the average initial ARM quote and the one-year, constant
maturity Treasury yield, the most prevalent ARM index, has shrunk
dramatically since the beginning of 1988, though ARM rates actually have

increased since winter relative to the commonly used Eleventh Federal
Home Loan Bank District cost-of-funds index.
Lenders often attempt to recoup interest income lost from ARM
teasers by raising the "margin," the markup over the index rate that
determines the borrower's interest rate after expiration of the discount
period. Thus, the lower the initial rate on an ARM relative to the
index, the higher will be the interest rate in subsequent periods. ARM
borrowers, however, are shielded somewhat from large jumps in interest
rates by rate caps, which typically limit rate increases to 2 percentage
points per adjustment period and 6 percentage points over the life of
the loan.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at a 4-3/4 percent
seasonally adjusted annual rate in July, down from the revised 15-1/4
percent June pace. The abrupt slowing in July reflected sharply lower
growth in automobile loans, particularly at finance companies, and in
revolving credit at commercial banks; in addition, all other installment
loans outstanding were about flat after expanding sharply in June. The
slowing in the use of installment credit in July is consistent with the
dropoff in unit sales of new autos and with the lackluster sales of
other (non-auto) types of consumer goods during the month.
Measures of the quality of household debt in the second quarter
were mixed, though patterns differed from those in the first quarter.
Delinquency rates on commercial bank credit cards edged down from a
five-quarter high to 2.39 percent in the second quarter, while the rate

on all closed-end loans at banks was unchanged at about the midpoint of
its range in recent years. Auto loan delinquencies at finance companies
rose to 2.21 percent, the highest quarterly average since mid-1980.
Delinquencies on home mortgages increased, but remained well below the
1985-86 highs. Personal bankruptcy, filings, meanwhile, edged down 2-1/4
percent, seasonally adjusted, from their record first-quarter level;
nonetheless, bankruptcy filings for the first half of 1988 were running
at a pace almost 13 percent above that in the year-earlier period.
Consumer loan rates generally increased between early May and early
August, and if banks follow their usual practices, the mid-August
increase in the prime rate should result in even higher consumer loan
rates over the next few months. In the late 1970s and early 1980s,
state usury ceilings effectively constrained banks from raising consumer
loan rates in response to increases in the prime. Since the removal of
these constraints, spreads of consumer loan rates over prime generally
have averaged close to levels prevailing in the mid to late 1970s.
Through the first three quarters of 1988, however, movements in consumer
loan rates at banks have lagged those of the prime, and spreads have
narrowed 50 to 85 basis points for selected categories. Auto loan
spreads have narrowed the most, perhaps reflecting competition from
other lenders. Credit card rates, which are typically slow to react to
changes in market rates, have shown virtually no movement, while
personal loan rates also have changed little, owing perhaps to the
increased popularity of variable-rate home equity lines of credit.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. Merchandise Trade
In July, the seasonally adjusted U.S. merchandise trade deficit was
$9.5 billion (Census basis, CIF valuation), compared with a $13.2
billion (revised) deficit in June. The deficit declined as imports fell
sharply and exports rose slightly. This is the first release since 1979
in which both the CIF and Customs value for imports were reported
simultaneously; on a Customs basis the July deficit was $8.1 billion.

Among imports the largest seasonally adjusted declines from June to
July were in consumer goods and capital goods, particularly power
generating machinery, ADP equipment, and office machines. Exports
showed small increases across all major categories with the exception of
automotive vehicles and parts. (Further discussion of trade through
July will be contained in the Greenbook supplement.)

For the second quarter, the merchandise trade deficit was $120
billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (balance-of-payments
basis), substantially below the $141 billion first-quarter rate. The
value of exports again reached an all-time high, while the value of
imports declined slightly from its record level of the first quarter
(see table below).

Nonagricultural exports increased to all areas of the world in the
second quarter, with the exception of the OPEC countries. Agricultural
exports to developed countries fell slightly, while those to developing
countries grew at an annual rate of 138 percent (partly explained by
shipments of corn to Mexico and wheat to Egypt). Non-oil imports from
Japan and Latin America fell slightly, while those from Canada, Western
Europe, and Asian developing countries rose.
In constant 1982 dollars, exports expanded at a 17 percent annual
rate from the first to the second quarter, a slower rate of increase
than recorded during the past year. The strongest increases were in
exports of civilian aircraft, industrial supplies excluding gold, and
consumer goods. Agricultural exports rose at a 6 percent annual rate.
The volume of non-oil imports declined by 7 percent at an annual rate in
the second quarter, reversing the steady upward trend of the past year.
Decreases were recorded in imports of industrial supplies excluding
gold, automotive products, and consumer goods. Reflecting strength in
U.S. domestic demand, imports of capital goods rose strongly (largely
due to deliveries of several Airbuses and an increase in imports of
semiconductors).
The volume of oil imports recorded a 14 percent annual increase in
the second quarter due to a greater than normal building of inventories.

The increase in inventories reflected an expectation that oil prices
would rise in the second half of the year. Prices of oil imports were
higher in May and June than in the previous two months, but prices in
world markets dropped sharply beginning in July. The lower world prices
reflected increased OPEC production (especially by Arab Persian Gulf
states) that began at the end of May. With increased prospects of peace
in the Persian Gulf, and further production increases by OPEC, prices
have fallen further in recent weeks.
U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit decreased to an annual rate of
$133 billion in the second quarter, compared with $148 billion (revised)
in the first quarter. The improvement was more than accounted for by
the $21 billion decrease in the merchandise trade deficit. Receipts on

both travel and passenger fares increased for the eighth consecutive
quarter, helping to boost net services by $3.5 billion, while direct
investment income, excluding capital gains and losses, rose by $4.3
billion. Capital losses on direct investment, due to the dollar's
recent appreciation, combined with higher net payments on portfolio
investment to swing total net investment income into deficit in the
second quarter.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
In July, private foreign residents continued to add to their
holdings of U.S. securities. Net private purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities (line 3 on the Summary of U.S. International Transactions
Table) amounted to $2.9 billion, adding to the $12.6 billion in net
purchases in the first half of 1988. Japanese residents accounted for
most of the net purchases in July; however, earlier in the year, net
purchases by residents of the United Kingdom and Germany were also
large.
Net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds by private foreign residents
(line 2a) amounted to $3.4 billion in July, adding to the $11.6 billion
in net purchases recorded in the first half of 1988. Again, residents
of the United Kingdom (including Eurobond underwriters), Japan, and
Germany were the largest net purchasers. However, issuance of new
bonds, both domestic and Eurobonds, by U.S. corporations has been
depressed in the third quarter to date.
Private foreign residents also added $1 billion to their holdings
of U.S. corporate stocks in July, equal to about the amount they had

added in the whole first half of 1988 (line 2b). Residents of Japan
accounted for the bulk of the net purchases.
Banks reported a substantial net capital outflow in their
transactions with all foreign residents in July, partially reversing the
very large capital inflow reported in the second quarter. (See line 1.)
However, it appears that domestic banking offices continued to bring in
funds, net, from their own foreign offices and IBFs on average in July
and August. (See line 1 of the International Banking Data Table.)
These reductions in net claims of U.S. banking offices on their own
foreign offices and IBFs in both the second quarter and the first two
months of the third quarter coincided with more rapid growth of bank
credit than core deposits.
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States were virtually
uncharged in July. (See line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions Table.) G-10 reserves did decline,
Partial information for August indicates additional
reductions in G-10 official reserve holdings at the FRBNY (about $4
billion).
OPEC official reserves in the United States were virtually
unchanged in July, after declining $3 billion in the first six months of
1988. The reserves held by other countries in the United States
continued to increase.

Data released September 13 by the Department of Commerce indicate a
sharp increase in foreign direct investment in the United States (line
7) from $7 billion in the first quarter of 1988 to $13 billion in the
second quarter. Much of the total was accounted for by acquisitions of
U.S. companies. U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6) declined to
virtually zero in the second quarter from an outflow of $6 billion in
the first quarter. There were continued sales of assets abroad by
Texaco and repayments of several large loans by foreign affiliates of
other companies. In addition, reinvested earnings were depressed by a
$3 billion swing from capital gains to losses associated with the
appreciation of the dollar. The statistical discrepancy in the U.S.
international transactions accounts (line 10) shifted from $4 billion of
unrecorded credits in the first quarter to -$16 billion in the second.
Alternative data sources indicate that unreported increases in U.S.
nonbanks' holdings of Eurodollar deposits accounted for part of the
omitted outflows.
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the most recent FOMC meeting on August 16, the weighted-
average foreign-exchange value of the dollar in terms of other G-10
currencies has moved down on balance about 1/4 percent, as shown in
Chart 1. The dollar has declined most against the mark and other
related European currencies, about 1 percent; against the yen, the
dollar rose about 1/2 percent on balance. In the early part of the
intermeeting period the dollar moved up

of strength in U.S. demand and the likelihood of further U.S.
tightening. Dollar strength was particularly evident against the mark,
as the dollar-mark rate briefly reached 1.92 DM/$, and the mark-yen
cross rate fell below 70 Y/DM. The dollar more than reversed these
early gains in the latter part of the period following increases in
foreign official interest rates and release of U.S. employment data for
August that indicated somewhat weaker U.S. activity. The dollar moved
up sharply following the release on September 14 of U.S. trade figures
for July which showed a smaller than expected deficit of $9-1/2
billion.
During the period, short-term interest rates on average moved
slightly against the dollar as many foreign interest rates moved up more
than did interest rates on dollar assets. An exception was Germany
where market short-term interest rates declined on balance by 40 basis
points. On August 25, the Bundesbank announced a 1/2 percentage point
increase in the German discount rate to 3-1/2 percent, and German
officials indicated that further decline in the mark would be resisted.
Even though the Lombard rate was not increased as some market
participants had anticipated and the Bundesbank continued to provide
liquidity at an unchanged RP-rate of 4-1/4 percent, the mark began to
strengthen, and German short-term market interest rates eased back from
high levels reached in a run-up earlier in the quarter.
The German discount rate change, as shown in Table 1, was
accompanied by similar increases in official rates in other European
countries including a 1/2 point increase in the Italian and Swiss

IV-12
discount rates and a 1/4 percentage point increase in the Dutch discount
rate, the French money market intervention rate, and the French 7-day RP
rate. U.K. money market dealing rates and base lending rates also were
raised by a full percentage point at about this time to combat inflation
and downward pressure on sterling. Japanese short-term interest rates
increased about 20 basis points during the intermeeting period, as
Japanese authorities allowed the key 2-month bill discount rate to edge
upward. Long-term interest differentials against the major currencies
remained about unchanged.
Of this amount about $1.3 billion was
sales by the Desk against marks, divided equally between sales for
System and Treasury accounts.
Pressures within the EMS intensified during
the period, particularly in recent weeks as the mark strengthened;
Developments in the Foreign Industrial Countries
After widespread strength in the first quarter, economic activity
slackened in the second quarter, as performances of the major foreign

IV-13
industrial nations diverged. In Germany, real GNP declined slightly in
the second quarter. Industrial production, housing starts, and export
volume fell in Japan, and comments by government officials indicate that
real GNP is likely to have fallen there as well. French growth slowed
to a moderate pace. In contrast, real GDP accelerated in Canada and the
United Kingdom in the second quarter. On balance during the first half
of the year, real growth was fairly strong in the major foreign
industrial countries, and available data for the third quarter generally
indicate continued expansion.
Germany recorded another peak trade surplus in June, while Japan's
trade surplus narrowed in August. In Germany, the cumulative trade
surplus for the first half of the year was considerably above the
surplus for the first half of 1987. In contrast, the United Kingdom
registered record trade and current account deficits in July and has
recorded cumulative deficits that are already much larger than last
year's totals.
Although inflation remains low in most of the major foreign
industrial nations, it has risen somewhat in recent months, especially
in the United Kingdom. Recent concerns about overheating, renewed
inflationary pressures, and/or unwelcome declines in the exchange value
of their currencies led several monetary officials to raise interest
rates. On August 25, the Bundesbank raised its discount rate by 1/2
percentage point and other European central banks, including the French
and Italian monetary authorities, followed suit. On the same day, the
Bank of England raised its money market dealing rate by a full

percentage point. The Bank of Canada has increased its key rates about
80 basis points in the list month.
Individual country notes. In Japan, economic activity slowed
dramatically in the second quarter. The average level of industrial
production (s.a.) was down slightly from its first-quarter average,
while housing starts continued to fall sharply. In addition, export
volume (s.a.) fell 3.1 percent from the first quarter. Although second-
quarter GNP data have not yet been released, EPA officials have
commented that real GNP may have declined, reversing some of the
vigorous growth in the previous quarter.
Economic activity may be rebounding in the third quarter, although
data for July provide a mixed picture: industrial production (s.a.)
declined 0.7 percent after a 3.3 percent increase in June, but remained
above the second-quarter average level. Housing starts (s.a.) fell 0.4
percent, but retail sales (s.a.) rose 1.5 percent. Export volume
increased, and import volume declined. Unemployment (s.a.) increased
from 2.4 percent in June to 2.5 percent in July, but the ratio of job-
offers-to applicants continued to rise. For the first time in 14 years,
job offers exceeded job seekers in June and July. Recent data on new
machinery orders also suggest continued strength in investment, as
private orders rose 25 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter. Consumer
price inflation remains low, with the Tokyo index of consumer prices
(n.s.a.) in August 0.6 percent above a year ago. Wholesale prices
(n.s.a.) were 1.0 percent below year-earlier levels in August.

IV-18
The trade surplus widened in July, but then narrowed in August to a
level about equal to the second-quarter average. The cumulative trade
surplus for the first eight months of 1988 was $73.9 billion (s.a.a.r.)
compared with $79.5 billion for 1987 as a whole. The current account
surplus through July was $78.2 billion (s.a.a.r.) compared with $87
billion in 1987.
Real GNP in Germany declined in the second quarter after unusually
strong growth in the first. Following a surge in the first quarter due
to unseasonably mild weather, construction activity (s.a.) declined 3.7
percent in the second quarter, and on balance grew 6.3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) since the fourth quarter of 1987. Private consumption
expenditures declined 2.2 percent (s.a.a.r.), while government spending
increased 3.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter. Net exports
increased sharply. More recent indicators suggest weakness in the
third quarter. Industrial production (s.a.) declined 2.2 percent in
July, offsetting most of June's surge. The volume of total new
manufacturing orders (s.a.) was flat in July after increasing 1 percent
in June as domestic orders rose 3 percent, but foreign orders declined 2
percent. In addition, the business sentiment index declined in July
after increasing six months consecutively. In August, the unemployment
rate was 8.9 percent (s.a.), unchanged from the rate for the previous
four months.
Consumer prices were flat in August after declining 0.1 percent in
July, resulting in year-over-year inflation of 1.1 percent. Wholesale

IV-19
prices increased 0.2 percent in August, to a level 1.0 percent above
last August's level.
The trade surplus (n.s.a.) increased sharply in June to $8.1
billion, bringing the cumulative surplus to $34.9 billion, up from the
surplus of $30.6 billion over the same period in 1987. The current
account surplus (n.s.a.) also rose in June to a record high of $5.5
billion boosting the cumulative surplus to $23.7 billion, compared with
a $22.3 billion surplus in the first half of last year.
Growth in the average level of M3 in July was 2.6 percent
(s.a.a.r.), a dramatic slowdown from an average growth rate of 7.7
percent during the last six months. The average level of M3 in July
stood 6.8 percent above the target base period of 1987-Q4, exceeding the
target range of 3 to 6 percent set for this year. On August 25th the
Bundesbank increased its discount rate 50 basis points to 3-1/2 percent,
while leaving the repurchase rate unchanged at 4-1/4 percent.
In France, real marketable GDP grew by 2.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
the second quarter after expanding at a 4.9 percent rate in the previous
quarter. Consumption expenditures fell slightly, while gross fixed
capital formation surged, in part due to increased housing starts.
Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in July, bringing the 12-month
inflation rate to 2.7 percent which forced the government to concede
that it would not meet its 2.5 percent target.
The foreign trade deficit widened in July as a 1 percent fall in
imports was accompanied by a 3 percent decline in exports. Despite this
recent deterioration, the cumulative trade deficit through July of $2.3

IV-20
billion represents an improvement from the $3.6 billion deficit
registered for the first seven months of last year.
In the United Kingdom, recent data have provided further evidence
of overheating. The output measure of real GDP increased by 5.3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter after rising by 2.7 percent in the
first. The volume of retail sales (s.a.) showed a 12-month increase of
6.3 percent in August, while the unemployment rate declined to 8.2
percent (s.a.) in July, the 24th consecutive monthly decline.
Industrial production rose 0.4 percent (s.a.) in July to a level 3.5
percent above that of a year ago. Consumer price inflation in the 12
months through July rose to 4.8 percent, the fifth consecutive monthly
increase in this rate. In August, producer prices rose to a level 4.8
percent above their year-ago level.
The trade and current accounts both showed record deficits in July.
The cumulative trade deficit through July was $33.9 billion (s.a.a.r.),
nearly triple the $12.4 billion deficit rate in the same period last
year. On August 25, U.K. monetary authorities raised their money market
dealing rates by one percentage point to 11-7/8 percent just after the
release of the July trade figures.
Real GDP in Canada expanded at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the
second quarter, up from the 3.2 percent rate posted in the first quarter
of 1988. Consumer spending rebounded and rose 0.9 percent after falling
0.1 percent in the first quarter of the year. Non-residential
investment and exports continued to be buoyant. Both industrial
production and monthly GDP reports showed lower growth rates in June

IV-21
than they had in May, suggesting that, at least in the near term, growth
may have peaked. In addition, the unemployment rate rose to 8.0 percent
in August from a second-quarter average rate of 7.7 percent. Consumer
prices increased 0.6 percent in July; the year-over-year inflation rate
was 3.8 percent. Producer prices held steady, increasing 0.2 percent in
July to a level 3.7 percent above last July.
Canada's trade surplus increased slightly in June from May and
April, resulting in a cumulative first-half surplus a bit higher than in
the first half of 1987. On August 31, Canada's House of Commons passed
legislation to implement the proposed free trade agreement with the
United States and sent the bill to the Canadian Senate for approval.
In Italy, recently released data indicate that the strong growth
recorded in 1987 continued in the first quarter of 1988; real GDP rose
to a level 3.1 percent above the first quarter of last year. The major
source of this strength was investment spending, which grew 6.6 percent
from its level a year ago. Italy's current account deteriorated
considerably in the first quarter; the deficit of $5.1 billion was more
than twice the size of that in the first quarter of 1987. However,
recently released trade data for April and May indicate that the deficit
may be smaller in the second quarter. The cumulative trade deficit
through May was $3.4 billion compared with a deficit of $2.5 billion in
the same period of 1987.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
In Brazil a new constitution has been completed and the successful
syndication to creditor banks of a financing package brought about final

IV-22
IMF Executive Board approval of a stand-by loan agreement. The Mexican
government announced on August 14 that the freeze on the exchange rate,
public sector prices, controlled private-sector prices, and minimum
wages would be extended through November. An incomes policy implemented
in August appears to have temporarily reduced inflation in Argentina.
Venezuela's foreign exchange reserves fell by $440 million in July.
Nigeria has reached a preliminary agreement on a rescheduling with its
commercial bank creditors. Ecuador and Peru announced anti-inflation
programs which include devaluations and domestic price increases.
Individual country notes. Brazil's new constitution has been
completed and goes into effect on October 5. Under this constitution
all major budgetary and financial decisions, including future agreements
with the IMF and foreign banks, must be approved by the legislature--
greatly increasing the difficulty of future negotiations.
By August 18, foreign banks had committed 95 percent of $5.2
billion in new money proposed for Brazil. The achievement of this
critical mass of financing permitted formal IMF Executive Board approval
of an SDR 1.1 billion stand-by agreement on August 23. Brazil and the
banks are expected to sign their agreement by the end of September.
Consumer prices rose 21 percent in August, following a 24 percent
increase in July. Turmoil in the financial markets, due to the
inclusion of a 12 percent real interest rate cap in the new constitution
and to increased taxes on short-term investments, sharply intensified
the demand for dollars. As a result, the spread between the parallel

IV-23
and official dollar rates jumped from about 50 percent in August to 75
percent at the beginning of September.
Increased exports of manufactured goods resulted in a trade surplus
for the first seven months of this year of $10.5 billion, more than
double the $4.9 billion registered for the same period in 1987. The
expansion of exports contributed to positive growth of industrial
production, which was 1.5 percent higher in June than a year before.
The Mexican government announced on August 14 that the freeze on
the exchange rate, public sector prices, controlled private-sector
prices, and minimum wages would be extended through November. To gain
organized labor's support, the government agreed to eliminate the value
added tax on processed foods and medicines and to reduce income taxes by
30 percent for individuals earning up to 4 times the minimum wage.
Business leaders pledged to reduce prices by an average of 3 percent.
This announcement helped to quiet the foreign exchange market,
where nervousness had prevailed for several weeks, and the outflow of
capital underway since late May appears to have abated somewhat.
The trade surplus is continuing to shrink. In June it was about
$300 million, less than one-third as large as in June 1987. Imports
exceeded $1.6 billion, the highest level since March 1982, and were 64
percent higher than in June 1987, while exports were nearly 3 percent
lower than a year earlier. Non-petroleum exports in June 1988 were 11
percent higher than in the same month in 1987, but oil exports were 25
percent lower, owing to weaker oil prices.

IV-24
The CPI, which had increased by 1.7 percent in July, rose by only
0.9 percent in August, the smallest monthly increase since April 1978.
Interest rates have changed little since early June, after their
dramatic decline of the previous four months. The nominal annual rate
on 28-day Treasury bills at the September 6 auction was 41.8 percent.
This is slightly higher than at the June 7 auction (40.3 percent), but
much lower than on February 23 (151.7 percent).
The incomes policy implemented in early August in Argentina appears
to have at least temporarily reduced the rate of inflation. Inflation
is projected to fall to about 10 percent for September--down sharply
from the average monthly rate of 27 percent for July and August.
However, it remains uncertain whether the government will achieve the
fiscal reform necessary to translate these gains into a permanent
reduction in the inflation rate. Recent private sector wage agreements
have been relatively generous; for example, the metal workers' union was
able to negotiate a 47 percent wage increase for August/September. But
so far industrialists seem to be adhering to price agreements with the
government despite increasing costs.
The Central Bank has been selling dollars through daily auctions
since early August. So far, demand has been weak as sales of dollars in
the free market have kept the austral price of dollars near the Central
Bank's minimum asking price of 14.4 australs. Interest rates on
interfirm and interbank loans have stayed around 10 percent on a monthly
basis since early August.

IV-25
Due to the postponement of projected dates of effectiveness for
World Bank loans, disbursement of the $500 million U.S. Treasury and
Bank for International Settlements bridge loan that was agreed to in
principle in August has also been delayed.
In Venezuela, the government has failed to adjust to falling oil
prices and rising world interest rates, leading to a widening of the
current account deficit and a more rapid draw-down of foreign exchange
reserves. In July total reserves minus gold dropped $440 million to
$4.5 billion; reserves were $6 billion at the beginning of 1988. The
Venezuelan government met with some of its commercial bank creditors
last month to discuss the possibility of new long-term loans to help
stem this loss of reserves.
Consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in August and stood 28 percent
higher than a year ago. Unusually favorable food supply conditions
helped to keep average monthly inflation for the first five months of
1988 down to 0.4 percent, but recent food price increases have pushed
the CPI up an average of 4 percent per month over the last three months.
Nigeria has reached preliminary agreement with its creditor banks
to reschedule $2.9 billion in principal payments due 1986-91 over 20
years with three years grace at a spread of 7/8 over LIBOR. The
agreement also reschedules $2.45 billion in letter-of-credit principal
arrears over 15 years with three years grace at a spread of 13/16 over
LIBOR and $381 million in interest arrears and commissions over 1989-91.
The rescheduling provides no new money and is not subject to IMF
conditionality.

IV-26
Newly elected President Rodrigo Borja of Ecuador announced a series
of measures to contain inflation and improve the current account
balance. The measures include: a 56 percent devaluation of the official
exchange rate, a 5 percent surtax on all import and export transactions,
a doubling of gasoline prices, a cap on domestic lending rates of
interest, and a compensatory increase in the minimum wage.
Peru announced a new program to control inflation, which reached 22
percent in August. The multiple exchange rate system will be unified
with the primary export rate devalued by 47.5 percent. As subsidies are
reduced to help close the fiscal deficit, the cost of gasoline will
increase almost 400 percent and the price of basic food items will
double. A compensating increase in the minimum wage is planned, and
wages and prices are to remain fixed for 120 days.
The Philippines met its end-June 1988 economic performance targets,
the central bank announced on August 31. This allowed the country to
draw the seventh and last tranche under an SDR 198 million IMF stand-by.
