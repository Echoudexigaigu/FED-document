The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The labor market surveys for October and November suggest that
nonfarm output has continued to expand at a fairly strong pace.
Employment growth in manufacturing was sizable in both months, and
hiring in the services sector surged in November. Indications of
spending are available mainly through October; at this point, it appears
that consumption is growing less rapidly than in the third quarter and
that capital spending has softened. Inflation for final goods and
services appears to be running in the 4 to 5 percent range.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market surveys for October and November indicate that
labor demand remains strong. The number of employees on nonfarm
payrolls rose more than 460,000 in November, after a gain of about
240,000 in October. Although the average workweek dropped in November,
this decline merely reversed an unusually sharp increase in the workweek
in October. On net, the payroll surveys for October and November left
the index of aggregate hours for production and nonsupervisory workers
about 0.8 percentage point above the third-quarter average. Employment
also was up sharply in the household survey in November.
The job gains in the payroll survey were widespread by industry.
Manufacturing employment rose sharply for the second consecutive month,
with particularly large increases in machinery, electrical equipment,
and lumber. Employment in service industries was up nearly 200,000 in
November; the growth in these industries had been less in previous
months. Hiring at construction sites apparently was sustained by

unusually good weather during the November survey week, while employment
continued to trend up in other industries.
The data on wages in the fourth quarter, although limited, suggest
that wage inflation remains on an upward course. The hourly earnings
index for production and nonsupervisory workers jumped 0.7 percent in
October and was unchanged in November, leaving it 1.0 percent above the
third-quarter average. Moreover, revised data on labor costs show that
hourly compensation picked up sharply in the third quarter to a level
nearly 5 percent above a year earlier. With the growth of productivity
averaging less than 1 percent over the four-quarter period ended in
1988-Q3, unit labor costs rose about 4 percent, well above the pace seen
in recent years.
The acceleration in wages and compensation from a year ago likely
has reflected this year's tightening of labor markets and an apparent
step-up in inflation expectations. Indeed, the overall civilian
unemployment rate remained below 5-1/2 percent in October and November;
both this overall rate and the jobless rates for many demographic,
industrial, and occupational subgroups are at levels that coincided with
accelerating wages in the late 1970s.
Other indicators also hint at a tightening of labor markets.
According to the Conference Board's survey of consumer confidence
(chart), more than 30 percent of households continue to believe that
jobs are quite plentiful; this indicator has strengthened markedly in
the past two years and is above its level of 1979. In addition, the
index of help-wanted advertising--a measure of job vacancies--is, on

average, close to its 1979 high. Moreover, anecdotes of hiring
difficulties are common, with reports of labor shortages evident in some
areas of the U.S.
Inflation expectations, which play a critical role in wage
determination, have moved up over the past year and are unlikely to
provide any offset to the upward pressures on wages associated with
hiring bottlenecks. As shown in the top panel of the chart, consumer
expectations of price inflation, as measured in the Michigan survey,
rose from about 4-1/4 percent in late 1987 to about 5-1/2 percent in the
spring and have remained high in recent months. Econometric results
based on the assumption that employers and workers are backward-looking
in formulating their expectations--so that expectations are based solely
upon past price changes--suggest that inflation expectations would have
risen roughly 1/2 percentage point this year.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Total industrial production is estimated to have risen 0.4 percent
in October and apparently posted a sizable gain in November. Production
worker hours in manufacturing rose considerably, partly because of
continued advances in the machinery and fabricated metals industries.
The available data on physical product (which constitute about
15 percent of the first estimate of industrial production) are mixed.
Motor vehicle assemblies were about unchanged in November. In the
1. In particular, the formulation shown in the accompanying chart
assumes that inflation expectations are based on a geometrically-
declining distributed lag of increases in the fixed weight price index
for personal consumption expenditures over the preceding three years.

energy sector, output of refined fuels declined last month, while crude
oil extraction and electricity generation were little changed, and
drilling activity fell further. Output of steel rose slightly after a
sharp decline in October.
Separately, the results of the November survey of purchasing
managers generally confirmed the strength in industrial activity
indicated by the labor market surveys. In particular, the number of
managers reporting increases in production, employment, and new orders
outnumbered those reporting declines by a wide margin.
In recent months the output of capital goods has continued to post
strong advances, but the composition of these gains has shifted. In
particular, production of computers rose 18 percent at an annual rate
during the first half of this year, accounting for nearly one-half of
the growth in output of business equipment; but during the third
2quarter, production of computing machines was little changed. By
contrast, output of other types of business equipment--which includes
machine tools, materials handling equipment, and general industrial
equipment (for example, pumps, bearings, and air compressors)--
accelerated during the third quarter. These gains stem from strong
export growth as well as efforts by domestic manufacturers to update and
expand capacity.
2. The 1977 value-added weight of computers in business equipment is
8.4 percent. However, since 1977 (the current base year for the IP
index) the output of computing machines has risen more than three times
faster than output of other capital goods. As a result, the current
proportion of computers in business equipment is about 26 percent.

Production of consumer goods has grown sharply in recent months--
at an annual rate of 6.3 percent during the third quarter and 0.6
percent in October. Output of nondurables has been bolstered by
continued advances in production of consumer chemicals and paper
products. Among durable consumer goods, production of appliances has
rebounded from earlier declines, and auto assemblies have risen
to their highest level since early 1987. However, the number of
assemblies of light trucks has shown little net change during the past
few months, apparently limited in part by capacity constraints.
The output of materials has changed little since its surge in July.
The recent weakness is attributable, in part, to declines in crude oil
extraction and the production of steel. Nevertheless, the output of
parts for capital goods has continued to rise.
Total capacity utilization rose 0.2 percentage point in October to
84 percent. The increase resulted from further upward movement in
utilization among manufacturing industries, principally those producing
nonelectrical machinery and motor vehicles. The operating rate for
manufacturing increased more than 2 percentage points during the year
ended in October, to 84.3 percent, its highest level since July 1979,
when it was 84.7 percent. In November the manufacturing utilization
rate apparently increased further. By contrast, capacity utilization in
the mining and utilities industries in October remained relatively low.
Personal Income and Consumption
Total personal income increased $72 billion at an annual rate in
October, owing to the temporary effects of two federal programs

II-14
providing subsidy payments to farmers. Excluding farm subsidy
payments as well as a one-time $6-1/2 billion bonus payment to workers
in the automobile industry, personal income rose $35 billion in October,
considerably above the average monthly increase for the year to date.
Disposable income was correspondingly strong, and the monthly saving
rate jumped to 5.2 percent.
The growth in consumer spending appears to be slowing in the
current quarter. This slowdown reflects softness in spending for motor
vehicles, and (on a quarterly basis) an easing of residential
electricity consumption, which had climbed during the summer heat wave.
However, a recent see-saw pattern in the monthly data, as well as the
possibility of big revisions, is making it difficult to identify the
underlying trend in consumer spending. In October, real personal
consumption expenditures rose 0.3 percent, reversing most of September's
0.4 percent decline. Spending in October was boosted by a sharp
bounceback in outlays for electricity and natural gas from a depressed
September level; outlays for other services remained on a sharp uptrend.
Spending on durables declined for the second consecutive month in real
terms, mainly because of reduced purchases of new autos. Nondurable
consumption was lackluster in October but was revised up to show
additional strength in August and September.
3. The October payments to farmers reflected the final installment of
deficiency payments for corn harvested in 1987 and the payments for
participation in this year's land conservation program. The total
subsidies were $2.5 billion, or $30.5 billion at an annual rate.

II-15
Autos and Trucks
Sales of new motor vehicles strengthened a bit in November, to an
annual rate of 14.8 million units, but thus far in the fourth quarter,
the sales pace is running below the level of the first three quarters of
the year. Sales of domestically produced autos posted a 7.2 million
unit annual rate (BEA seasonals) last month--up from a 6.8 million unit
pace in October--while sales of imported cars edged down slightly to a
2.9 million unit annual rate. Sales of light trucks declined to a 4.6
million unit annual rate.

level since the turn of the year. Consequently, automakers have trimmed
their production plans a bit. Nevertheless, production plans for
December remain at a robust 8 million unit annual rate (BEA seasonals),
and intentions for the first quarter of 1989 have been revised up
somewhat to a 7.3 million unit annual rate. Should sales remain near
current levels for long, some combination of more substantial cutbacks
in scheduled assemblies and expanded incentive plans would seem likely.
Business Fixed Investment
Outlays for business fixed investment were weak in early autumn.
However, this weakness seems likely to be temporary. The backlog of
orders is sizable in many industries, and the initial surveys of firms'
capital spending plans for 1989 are pointing to a continued rise in
spending on plant and equipment, albeit at a slower pace than in 1988.
In October, shipments of nondefense capital goods were little
changed. However, excluding aircraft and parts, shipments fell about
1-1/4 percent, pushing the October level 1 percent below the third-
quarter average. In addition to the fairly broad-based deceleration in
shipments of nondefense capital goods, business purchases of new cars
probably edged lower.
New orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding the aircraft
group, declined for a second month in October to a level 3-3/4 percent
below the third-quarter level. The softening in new bookings in these
two months comes in the wake of very rapid gains earlier in the year.
Much of the recent decline has been in the high-technology area (chart),
particularly for office and computing machinery, but also for

communications equipment. Orders for heavy industrial machinery--which
constitute about half of total orders, excluding aircraft and parts and
high-technology equipment--have softened as well in recent months, after
a pronounced run-up earlier in the year. However, these orders continue
to outstrip shipments by a wide margin and should support a healthy rate
of spending for heavy machinery in the near term.
The value of nonresidential construction put-in-place, which
includes all structures except oil and gas wells, was little changed in
October and remains just below the third-quarter level. Petroleum
drilling activity, as measured by the number of rigs in use, continued
to fall through November. The value of new nonresidential construction
contracts, a broad but volatile indicator of future building activity,
fell 5-3/4 percent in October but has shown little net change over the
past six months. All told, these indicators suggest that spending on
nonresidential construction is likely to remain sluggish into 1989.
The McGraw-Hill survey of planned capital spending, taken in
September and October, indicated that firms expect nominal outlays to
increase about 5-3/4 percent in 1989. Similarly, the fall survey from
Economic Consulting and Planning Inc.--the successor to the Merrill
4Lynch survey--reported a 5-1/4 percent expected increase. Over the
past two decades, these fall surveys have tended to underpredict
spending by between 1 and 2 percentage points, and the mean error
without regard to sign is roughly 5 percentage points.
4. The Commerce Department survey of capital spending plans will not
be released until December 21, 1988.

II-21
Business Inventories
Business inventories continued to rise through the third quarter at
a pace roughly in line with the growth in business sales. In constant
dollars, stocks at all manufacturing and trade establishments rose
$24.4 billion at an annual rate in September, bringing the rate of
accumulation for the third quarter to $22.5 billion. About one-third of
last quarter's inventory buildup occurred at retail auto dealerships.
Excluding auto dealers, the rate of stockbuilding remained moderate, and
the inventory-sales ratio for nonauto businesses was little changed over
the third quarter.
Current-cost data indicate that manufacturers' inventories
continued to expand moderately in October. On the whole, factory
inventory investment in recent months has been concentrated in
industries that have enjoyed robust demand in both domestic and export
markets--in particular, metals, aircraft, and many types of industrial
and commercial machinery. In most manufacturing industries, inventory-
shipments ratios at the end of October remained well within the
historically low range of the past year.
In the trade sector, recent inventory accumulation, on balance,
has been slow since late spring. Although the accumulation of durable
goods inventories accelerated a little at the wholesale level in the
third quarter--mainly in stocks of motor vehicles and machinery--the
pace was still moderate compared with last winter, and does not seem to
have led to serious imbalances. In the retail sector, the buildup of
nonauto stocks has been broadly in line with sales; indeed, the

inventory-sales ratio has been unchanged since April. Retail apparel
inventories, which appeared burdensome earlier this year, turned down in
recent months, but remain at a relatively high level. Elsewhere in the
trade sector, there appears to be no significant inventory overhang at
the present time.
Housing Markets
Housing activity strengthened in October. Single-family starts
spurted to 1.15 million units, likely owing in part to some downward
movement in mortgage interest rates after August. New home sales rose
further in October to 733,000 units at an annual rate, the strongest
monthly pace since February 1987. In the existing home market, sales
did drop a little in October, but were only modestly below the strong
sales rate recorded for the third quarter. Multifamily housing starts
remained flat in October, reflecting the continued effects of
unfavorable market fundamentals.
Looking ahead, the annual increase in the number of households is
projected to slow from about 1.4 million in recent years to about
1.2 million in the first half of the 1990s (table). This reduction in
household formations, in turn, implies a decline in required additions
to the housing stock and hence in housing expenditures. However, the
changing age composition of the population should provide some offset to
the expected negative effect of lower household formations on housing
investment expenditures. The projected contraction in the number of
households below age 35 suggests reduced demand for relatively less
expensive "starter" homes (table). By contrast, the number of

II-26
households in the 35 to 54 year age bracket is projected to rise more
rapidly in coming years than it did in the late eighties. More
expensive "trade-up" homes typically are demanded by families in these
age groups.

Federal Government
In October, the first month of the 1989 fiscal year, the federal
government recorded a budget deficit of $27.4 billion, compared with
$30.8 billion a year earlier. The year-earlier deficit figure,
however, was inflated by special factors that changed the timing of
outlays and boosted October 1987 spending by roughly $3 billion.
Moreover, in some key sectors, outlays this October were not yet

II-27
reflecting influences that will become more apparent as the fiscal year
unfolds. Outlays under the special drought relief programs had not yet
begun in October and now are expected to be small until next quarter.
In addition, outlays by the deposit insurance agencies hit a lull at the
start of the new fiscal year, perhaps owing to administrative delays;
FSLIC's ongoing program of reorganizing troubled thrifts suggests a
resurgence soon.
Total receipts in October were about 2 percent higher than a year
earlier. As expected, personal income taxes were little changed from a
year ago, as growth in nominal income has been offset by the second
installment of the rate reduction legislated in the Tax Reform Act of
1986. Social insurance tax receipts were up about 7 percent from a year
earlier, reflecting in part the January tax rate hike.
Reports are that the Office of Management and Budget's preliminary
estimates of the current services budget for FY1990 point to a deficit
of a bit less than $135 billion. President Reagan is required by law to
submit FY1990 budget proposals on January 9 (the first Monday after
January 3) that meet the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit target of
$100 billion for FY1990. The economic projections the Administration
will use in preparing the budget were released earlier in the month and
are shown in the following table. These projections show real GNP
growth of 3.5 percent in 1989 and reductions in the rates of
unemployment, interest, and inflation. Given these economic assumptions
and no major changes in technical assumptions, it appears that the

State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
have expanded in recent months. In October, state and local government
construction outlays resumed their upward course, and employment in the
sector rose in November to 128,000 above its third-quarter average.
Underlying demand for infrastructure remains strong in the state
and local sector. Indeed, voters approved nearly $14 billion in general
obligation issues in this year's bond referenda, nearly double the
record 1986 pace. This was the fifth consecutive year that more than 80
percent of proposed bond authority was approved. Proceeds of these
bonds will finance a broad range of capital projects, ranging from roads

and sewers to prisons. Public education also likely requires
significant expansion of infrastructure as well as staffing. Elementary
and secondary school enrollments have been rising since 1985 and are
expected to advance further in coming years (chart). Moreover,
according to projections of the Department of Education the student-
teacher ratio will likely decline a bit further.
Spending over the next year may be restrained to some extent by
fiscal pressures, which have become more widespread of late. To date,
29 states anticipate low year-end balances, or deficits, in fiscal year
1989, which ends June 30 for most states; by comparison, 13 states
experienced such budgetary pressures in fiscal year 1988. The problem
appears to be particularly troublesome among six relatively large
states, owing to lower-than-expected tax collections in four states and
weak oil prices in the other two. A variety of strategies have been
undertaken to ameliorate the shortfalls, including the use of "rainy-
day" funds and a reduction in outlays. New York, for example, has
temporarily frozen state hiring as well as its outlays for construction
and equipment.
Prices
Consumer prices for food eased in October, and energy prices were
little changed, but prices of other goods and services increased, on
balance, somewhat more rapidly than in preceding months. And, although
there are reports of an easing of pressures on some materials prices,
overall inflation for intermediate supplies continues to be rapid.

Pressures of the drought on food prices appear to be tapering off,
after the sharp runup of the summer. In October, the CPI for food rose
only 0.2 percent, as further drought-related increases for foods such as
cereal and bakery products, vegetable oils, and processed fruits and
vegetables were largely offset by declines for fresh fruits and
vegetables, meats, and poultry. More recently, livestock price changes
in agricultural commodity markets have been mixed: cattle prices
have been firm, but hog prices dropped in late November to the lowest
level since 1980. Crop prices have retreated noticeably since mid-
October, and when coupled with recent trends in livestock prices,
suggest that the PPI for crude foods will turn down in November after
11 months of increase.
Retail energy prices edged up 0.1 percent in October; the prices of
gasoline and fuel oil fell, but there were offsetting increases for
natural gas and electricity. In late November, OPEC members agreed to
cut output of crude oil well below the pace of recent months, and both
spot and posted prices of crude oil have since moved up. Nevertheless,
the effectiveness of this agreement clearly is in doubt; even if
production limits are adhered to, the overhang of crude oil stocks
accumulated during the recent period of high production will restrain
prices. Moreover, because most of the price declines of this summer had
not shown through at the pump, some of the firming of crude oil prices
(to the extent that it persists) may be partially absorbed by refiners
and marketers; by contrast, a drop in crude prices to their pre-

agreement levels could result in further declines in prices of petroleum
products.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose 0.5 percent in
October, after increasing 0.4 percent in September. The goods
component, up 0.7 percent, was boosted for the second month by a hike in
apparel prices. The increases for apparel--about 2 percent in both
September and October--were associated with the introduction of fall and
winter clothing in the CPI sample and, to some extent, with seasonal
adjustment difficulties.5 Price advances for other goods averaged
between 0.3 and 0.4 percent in October. Nonenergy service prices rose
0.5 percent, with large increases for auto insurance and finance, as
well as for some entertainment items.
In contrast to the CPI for goods, the producer price index
excluding food and energy fell in October. Much of this divergence
reflects different approaches to pricing new-model cars and light trucks
in these indexes. In the CPI, the new models are phased into the sample
as they replace vehicles from the previous model year in dealer sales;
new car prices were up 0.2 percent in October, in part reflecting
higher-priced 1989 models. By contrast, the PPI records manufacturers'
prices only for the latest models, beginning in October and continuing
through September of the following year--often leading to more volatile
price changes at this time of year. This year, the PPI for cars
5. With the 1987 CPI revision, the BLS improved markedly its pricing
procedures for the months when new seasonal clothing styles are
introduced. However, the seasonal adjustment factors are based mainly
on prior years. This has resulted in sharp increases in the seasonally
adjusted index for apparel in September, October, March, and April.

declined 1-3/4 percent in October, on a seasonally adjusted
basis, reversing a September increase of about the same magnitude.
Also, incentive programs changed relatively little in the September-
October period, in marked contrast to the previously typical seasonal
pattern of very large discounts in September that are virtually
eliminated in October.
At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for intermediate materials
less food and energy rose 0.5 percent in October, about the average pace
in recent months. Prices of crude nonfood materials less energy edged
up 0.2 percent, as increases--notably for copper ore and scrap--were
largely offset by declines for steel and aluminum scrap and other
materials. Since the pricing date for the October PPI, prices in spot
commodity markets have reached new highs for copper but have receded for
steel scrap.
A longer-term perspective on the composition of price inflation is
provided by the final table, which compares twelve-month changes in
selected components of the CPI over the past four years. Excluding the
food and energy sectors, prices have accelerated from about 4 percent in
1985 and 1986 to 4-1/2 percent in 1988. The commodities component more
than accounts for this acceleration. Some of the pickup in this
category reflects a sharp turnaround in used car prices in the past two
years. Among other goods, the acceleration likely reflects higher
import prices and, more recently, a pickup in the prices of domestic
manufactures. This has been most notable for apparel, but also is
apparent for housefurnishings, entertainment goods, and tobacco

II-38
products. An important exception to this pattern of acceleration has
been new car prices, which have slowed over the past two years.
In contrast to the pickup in commodity prices, the CPI for
nonenergy services has decelerated over the past two years--to about
4-3/4 percent per year compared with the 5-1/2 percent pace in 1985-86.
The slowing has been fairly broadly based across the items composing the
services category. Nonetheless, the extent of the deceleration should
be viewed with some caution. A slowing in the rent categories, which
are heavily weighted in services, has coincided with a marked
improvement in the CPI sample beginning with the 1987 revision. Thus,
it is difficult to ascertain whether the smaller increases in the past
two years reflect a slowing in underlying housing costs or the changed
sample of rental units.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Short-term interest rates have moved up considerably since the last
FOMC. Although the federal funds rate has edged only a little higher--
from below 8-3/8 percent in early November to above 8-1/2 percent in
recent days--incoming indicators pointing to continued strong economic
expansion, a rebound in oil prices, and a decline in the dollar all have
led to a marked revision in market participants' expectations regarding
prospective money market conditions. Consequently, key Treasury bill
rates have risen about 65 basis points over the intermeeting period,
while most private short-term rates are up about 85 points. (One-month
rates have shown larger increases, as they began to incorporate
anticipated year-end rate pressures.) The prime rate was raised
1/2 percentage point to 10-1/2 percent on November 28.
In addition to these bearish developments, the bond markets have
had to deal with some special uncertainties, particularly those
associated with the recent wave of corporate restructurings. A
heightened sense of "event risk" has caused an aversion to investment-
grade industrial bonds, prompting strong demands for mortgage- and other
asset-backed instruments and for utility bonds. On net, long-term
yields have risen much less than short rates over the intermeeting
period, resulting in a further flattening of the term structure of
interest rates.
Expansion of the broader monetary aggregates picked up in November.
Demand for liquid retail-type instruments showed an especially strong
increase, perhaps reflecting a preference for liquidity in light of
III-1

III-2
uncertain interest rate prospects as well as some temporary parking of
funds generated by sales of equity in corporate restructurings. Barring
unanticipated sharp fluctuations in December, the fourth-quarter to
fourth-quarter increases in M2 and M3 will be well centered in the 1988
target ranges of 4 to 8 percent. Ml was about flat in November, as it
has been for several months, but will expand around 4 percent for the
year as a whole.1
Credit growth seems to have slowed a bit thus far in the fourth
quarter, although private credit demands are expected to rise
considerably in December to finance acquisitions and leveraged buyouts
of unprecedented size. For the fourth quarter, net equity retirements
are expected to approach $200 billion at an annual rate. Through
November, however, expansion of business credit is estimated to have
been down, even with an increased volume of junk bond issuance and other
merger-related financing. Federal borrowing will pick up only
moderately in the quarter, despite a near-doubling of the quarterly
budget deficit. Municipal bond issuance fell off in November, but
remained a bit above the third-quarter pace. Available data suggest
that mortgage demand has been well maintained thus far in the quarter
and that other household borrowing is not much changed from the moderate
pace of the preceding months.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2, boosted by unusual growth in savings deposits as well as by
strength in money market mutual funds, is estimated to have expanded at
1. A discussion of money and credit growth in 1988 appears in an
appendix.

III-3
about a 7 percent annual rate last month, up sharply from its October
pace. Still, based on October and November levels, M2 this quarter
should expand at only around a 3 percent rate, broadly in line with
econometric models of money demand that suggest growth should be
significantly restrained by earlier increases in interest rates and
opportunity costs. M3 is estimated to have picked up much less last
month, to a 6 percent rate, as bank credit growth and associated funding
needs remained quite moderate.
M1 was about unchanged in November. Demand deposits resumed
running off as rising interest rates increased opportunity costs and
likely led to reductions in compensating balances. In addition, some
firms may be seeking to run down demand balances held under such
arrangements in order to square accounts by year-end. With their
opportunity cost relative to retail time deposits rising much more
slowly, other checkable deposits expanded at a 6 percent annual rate in
November after being little changed on average over the preceding two
months.
The strengthening of other checkable deposits was part of a more
general shift by retail depositors to more liquid assets within the
nontransactions component of M2. Savings deposits, which had been
running off, surged, primarily reflecting a single deposit of proceeds
of a change in corporate ownership. In addition, growth of general
purpose/broker-dealer money market mutual funds leapt in November to a
35 percent annual rate, even though higher market interest rates were
acting to discourage inflows by late in the month.

Growth in small time deposits, although down a bit, remained in
double digits last month. Expansion of these deposits at thrifts,
however, continued to be unusually weak compared with that at banks. In
addition to any investor portfolio shifts motivated by the steady stream
of bad publicity about the FSLIC and the thrift industry, weaker inflows
to thrifts reflect the persistence of the less aggressive deposit
pricing by these institutions that emerged early in the summer. Since
June, small time deposit growth at thrifts has been approximately half
that at banks. This new pricing alignment may reflect the closing of
thrifts that had paid unusually high rates, as well as jawboning by the
FHLBB. Pressure on thrifts' net interest margins arising from the
continued flattening of the market yield curve also may be prompting
more conservative pricing of deposits.

Within the non-M2 component of M3, institution-only MMMFs
accelerated to a 35 percent annual rate last month, after an increase in
their yields relative to alternative market instruments early in the
month. However, issuance of large time deposits slowed substantially
in November at both banks and thrifts. At thrifts, this appears to have
represented greatly increased reliance on FHLB advances, which
typically have longer maturities than large CDs. The shift may
represent an attempt by some thrifts to lock in funding costs in
anticipation of further rate increases. At banks, curtailment of large
CD issuance occurred despite a substantial outflow of government
balances and reflected a shifting of funding sources toward offshore
branches in addition to a weakening of credit growth.
Bank credit is estimated to have expanded at a 5-1/2 percent annual
rate in November, somewhat below its October pace, as net acquisitions
of securities slowed. Total loan growth was essentially unchanged
despite a contraction in business and security loans. C&I loan growth
has been generally sluggish since July, and a survey of senior loan
officers conducted in mid-November suggests that the weakness had been
caused by a reduction in loan demand resulting primarily from decreased
corporate funding needs and some falloff in completed mergers and buyout
deals. Nevertheless, C&I loan growth in November would have weakened
substantially more had it not been for merger-related demands.
Real estate lending remained robust in November, expanding at a 13
percent annual rate. Growth of consumer loans at banks picked up,
although adjusted to reflect securitization activity, it moderated to

its slowest pace since July. The senior loan officer survey, however,
suggests that bank willingness to lend to households has continued to
increase, perhaps partly as a consequence of the greater ease of
removing receivables from their books via securitization.
Business Finance
Growth of commercial paper of nonfinancial businesses is estimated
to have slowed somewhat from the very rapid pace in October. Some of
the continued strength may reflect shifts from long- to short-term
financing that were motivated by recent increases in long-term rates and
by the takeover-induced turbulence in sectors of the corporate bond
market. Any such shifting, however, does not appear to be showing
through to bank lending, and the sum of commercial paper and bank loans
expanded at only a 2 percent rate last month.
A surge in merger-related junk bond issuance left gross public
long-term offerings by nonfinancial firms unchanged in November, as
investment-grade issuance by industrial firms became minuscule after the
announcement on October 20 of a proposed management-led LBO of RJR
Nabisco, by far the largest takeover ever attempted. Bond markets were
disrupted by concern that even high quality debt of large corporations
now was subject to substantial devaluation in the event of a takeover
attempt. 2
2. The board of directors of RJR Nabisco announced on November 30 that
it had accepted a bid for the purchase of the company from the firm of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. The purchase price was $25.1 billion.
The financing of this takeover, scheduled for early January, is expected
to entail around $13 billion of borrowing from a consortium of 65 to 80
domestic and foreign banks. Of the remainder, $5 billion will come from
a bridge loan from two investment banks that will be repaid with
(Footnote continues on next page)

III-10
This so-called event risk caused the spread between A-rated
industrial bonds and 30-year Treasury bonds to widen by as much as 25
basis points during the week after the announcement of the RJR Nabisco
proposal. With issuance of investment-grade instruments coming to a
standstill over the subsequent five weeks, the additional yield premium
over Treasuries on most industrial issues was eliminated. However,
trading in the secondary market has been thin, and any new issuer of
debt deemed subject to event risk likely would have had to pay a
significant premium. Investment-grade issuance by industrial firms
revived slightly in late November, as a few firms came to market with
issues embodying covenants that provide bondholders with additional
protections.
Investors have responded to the greater event risk in the
industrial bond sector by redirecting demand to other quality issues,
such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed bonds, encouraging an
increase in the quantity of these instruments supplied. Owing to the
nearly $5 billion issuance of junk bonds in November, and to prospects
(Footnote continued from previous page)
proceeds of junk bond issuance. Phillip Morris' takeover of Kraft for
around $13 billion will be financed in large part by a $12 billion
facility involving 80 foreign and domestic banks; financing is expected
to take place by mid-December.
3. Starting in 1986, many corporate bond offerings included "poison
puts," which allowed bondholders to sell their bonds back to the issuer
at par in the event of an unfriendly takeover. However, these
convenants have afforded bondholders little effective protection
because most takeovers ultimately are consummated without opposition
from the target firm's board of directors. The late-November issues
included stronger covenants that would allow bondholders to put the
bonds back to the company at par over the next ten years if the bonds
fall below investment grade following a major restructuring.

III-11
for considerable additional supply, junk bond spreads over Treasuries
reportedly have increased 50 to 100 basis points since the summer.
Stock prices have declined by about 2 percent from the post-crash
peaks reached on October 21. Prices of takeover.candidates, while still
outperforming the broad market averages, have softened somewhat since
the last FOMC. While equity issuance by nonfinancial firms continues to
be light, initial public offerings by closed-end funds have been sizable
and four bank holding companies have issued a total of $710 million in
preferred stock over the past two months as part of their efforts to
meet new capital requirements.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff expects the fourth-quarter federal budget deficit to
mount to $68 billion, almost double that posted last quarter. It is
anticipated that this widening of the deficit will be financed by an
unusually large, more than $20 billion, drawdown of the Treasury's cash
balance, while the further pickup in government borrowing is relatively
small. Marketable borrowing is expected to rise about $4 billion from
the third-quarter level. Nonmarketable borrowing also is likely to
increase somewhat, reflecting stronger issuance of SLGS associated with
an earlier pickup in municipal bond offerings. "Other borrowing" is
likely to be about unchanged as issuance of FSLIC notes, which slumped
in October, is expected to accelerate before year-end, owing to the tax
4incentives to complete resolutions by that time.
4. The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act requires that, after
December 31, 1988, the amount of losses and interest expense on the
books of acquired insolvent thrifts that acquiring institutions may
carry over to their own books be reduced to 50 percent of the value of
tax-free FSLIC assistance.

Since the end of the second quarter, the gross size of weekly bill
auctions has been increased four times. The rise in bill issuance has
contributed to some upward pressure on bill rates over this period and,
in conjunction with the cancellation of the bond auction in August, led
to a stalling out in the upward trend in the average maturity of
privately held marketable Treasury debt (see chart on page III-14).
However, with the signing into law in early November of the Technical
and Miscellaneous Revenue Act, which rescinded the limit on the
Treasury's long-bond authority, coupon auctions during the fourth
quarter are expected to raise about $5 billion more than in the third
quarter.
The unusually narrow spread between rates on 30-year bonds and 10-
year notes was little affected by the delayed auction of $9 billion in
30-year bonds late in November. Possibly contributing to the narrowness
of this spread has been the robust demand for stripped securities. At
the end of October, roughly 42 percent of outstanding 30-year bonds was
held in stripped form, compared with 27 percent a year ago, an increase
of roughly $20 billion.
Since midyear, the Federal Home Loan Banks have raised an
estimated $9 billion of new funds, accounting for 80 percent of all
borrowing by sponsored agencies, in order to meet a strong demand for
advances by member institutions. Despite the heavy issuance and
continued adverse publicity about the thrift industry, yields on FHLB
issues relative to those on Treasury securities increased only slightly

during the third quarter. In part, this may reflect an overall slowing
in credit demands by other agencies over that period.
Municipal Securities
Gross new issues of long-term tax-exempt securities totaled about
$9 billion in November, a decline from October's pace. Most of the
slowdown followed a midmonth increase in interest rates that resulted in
a substantial drop in issuance of refunding bonds; new capital
offerings, which are less sensitive to interest rate movements, equaled
October's volume.

Nearly $210 billion of industrial development bonds backed by
corporations, but issued by municipalities prior to the imposition of

by greater corporate leveraging. Prices of other tax-exempt bonds, on
the other hand, generally fared better immediately after the RJR

announcement than federal government and some corporate bonds, although
this improvement subsequently disappeared.
Los Angeles County announced plans to place privately with Japanese
institutional investors $100 million in 10-year taxable bonds
denominated in yen. This unusual financing should further open
international markets to state and local governments. The program is
aimed entirely at earning arbitrage profits, earmarked for a county
employee pension fund. The proceeds will be reinvested in high-yield
securities, including dollar-denominated foreign securities; a series of
foreign currency swaps is being used to reduce foreign exchange risk.
Mortgage Markets
Despite a rise in interest rates that began in March, growth in
total mortgage debt outstanding picked up in the third quarter from the
comparatively moderate second-quarter pace, though it ran behind the
average quarterly pace of the past few years.
Much of the growth of residential mortgage debt in the third
quarter and continuing through October, was associated with larger net
acquisitions of mortgage-related assets by FSLIC-insured thrifts.
Virtually all of the whole mortgage loans acquired by thrifts in the
third quarter featured adjustable rates, as these institutions continued
to sell fixed-rate mortgages outright or to swap them for agency-backed
pass-throughs, which can be funded less expensively through repurchase
agreements.

III-17
The strength in mortgage growth at thrifts partly reflects borrower
preference for ARMs. The ARM share of newly originated mortgage loans
has edged up despite some recent narrowing of the spread between fixed-
rate mortgages and ARMs. ARMs have accounted for more than 70 percent
of loans originated at FSLIC-insured thrifts in recent months, while a
lesser share of loans closed at commercial banks and mortgage companies
have been ARMs.
The strength in home lending activity in the third quarter, and
thrift activity in particular, may reflect robust sales of homes--
especially in the western United States, as institutions in California,
Arizona, and Nevada have accounted for more than half of all thrift
mortgage originations in recent months. The monthly volume of mortgage
loans closed at FSLIC-insured institutions in the third quarter was
12 percent above the average for the first half of the year. Loan
originations at thrifts subsequently backed down in October.
Because of the large ARM share of conventional home loans closed,
and the limited scale of ARM securitization, issuance of federally
related pass-through securities continues to run well below the average
monthly pace of the past two years. Issuance of these securities
totaled a seasonally adjusted $13.5 billion in September, about
unchanged from the August level.
While pass-through issuance has been flat in recent months, Freddie
Mac and Fannie Mae have stepped up issuance of multiclass mortgage-
backed securities. The heightened demand for collateral for multiclass
mortgage securities, given the limited mortgage supply, continues to be

reflected in narrow rate spreads between mortgage products and Treasury
securities. This spread also has been kept down by lower interest rate
volatility, which lessens the likelihood that the mortgage borrower's
prepayment option will be exercised, and by the takeover-related
developments in the market for corporate securities.
In the primary mortgage market, the average contract rate on new
commitments for 30-year, fixed-rate conventional home loans has
increased 22 basis points over the intermeeting period and the average
initial rate quoted on ARMs indexed to the one-year constant maturity
Treasury yield has risen only 13 basis points. Lenders tend to increase
the initial discounts offered on ARMs in periods of rising rates, in
some cases recouping the lost income through increased points.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit expanded at a 6-1/2 percent seasonally
adjusted annual rate during October, following a flat September and a 10
percent rate of increase in August. The sharp month-to-month swings
between August and October partly reflect cessation this year of large-
scale automobile incentive programs of the type that had been in place
in each of the previous three years and had been built into seasonal
adjustment factors. As a result, seasonally adjusted auto credit
contracted at a 3-1/3 percent rate in September but expanded at a 5-1/2
percent pace in October. Revolving credit--the fastest growing
component this year--also strengthened substantially in October from a
slow September.

Interest rates on most types of consumer loans have risen in recent
months. Rates on new-car loans at auto finance companies in October
averaged above 13 percent, up nearly one percentage point from their
level last spring. Finance rates at banks on both new-car and personal
loans rose about 70 basis points between early May and early November.
Rates on credit cards, however, which had declined much less than other
consumer rates earlier in the expansion, edged down slightly over the
same time span.
As it had the previous quarter, the delinquency rate on credit card
accounts at commercial banks declined fairly sharply in the July to
September period. Delinquencies on various types of closed-end loans
were mixed, however. A decline in past due auto loans partly offset
higher delinquencies on personal and mobile home loans, and the overall
average for the closed-end categories was up moderately. The proportion
of delinquent car loans at the auto finance companies was virtually
unchanged during the third quarter. Most of these series are around the
middle of their ranges of the past 15 years.

APPENDIX1
GROWTH OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN 1988
Money growth has been moderate but uneven over the course of 1988,
with the monetary aggregates expanding rapidly in the first part of the
year and slowing thereafter. The pattern of M1 and M2 growth this year
has reflected variations in interest rates and opportunity costs.
Initially, the decline in market interest rates after the October 1987
stock market crash buoyed money growth; however, the demand for monetary
assets has been damped since the spring by the climb in market rates
that began in the first quarter of this year. On balance, M1 grew at a
4 percent rate from the fourth quarter of 1987 through November of this
year, down from last year's 6-1/4 percent rate. M2 expanded at a 5-1/2
percent rate, up from 4 percent in 1987; this growth placed M2 in the
lower half of its 1988 annual target range of 4 to 8 percent.
Variation in M3 growth during 1988 mirrored trends in bank and
thrift credit, which posted stronger growth over the first half the
year. After expanding 5-1/2 percent in 1987, M3 remained close to the
top of its 4 to 8 percent target cone through July. The subsequent
slowdown, however, accompanying a moderation in bank and thrift credit
growth, left the aggregate only slightly above the midpoint of its range
and resulted in 6-1/2 percent growth through November.
In contrast to the monetary aggregates, domestic nonfinancial
sector debt grew at a fairly steady pace of 8-1/2 percent from the last
quarter of 1987 through October of this year, which placed it slightly
below the midpoint of its monitoring range of 7 to 11 percent. This
year's rate of debt expansion was down from nearly 10 percent in 1987
and well below the pace of other recent years, as growth in both private
and government credit demands receded.
M1
M1 growth for 1988 is likely to be the slowest in almost 20 years.
Velocity, which began to increase in 1987, rose at roughly a 2 percent
annual rate over the first three quarters of 1988 and is expected to
rise further in the fourth quarter. M1 expanded on balance at nearly a
6 percent pace over the first seven months of the year, although month-
to-month swings in its growth were quite large during this period. The
lower interest rates early in the year and strong income growth boosted
demands for money. Since July, however, M1 has increased very little,
mostly because of the effects of higher market interest rates.
With regard to the components of M1, growth in other checkable
deposits remained strong through midyear. Their opportunity costs had
narrowed appreciably after the stock market crash, boosting demand for

these deposits. But the effects of the climb in market interest rates
began to depress OCD growth by midsummer, especially as the higher rates
were reflected fairly promptly in yields on time deposits. As a result,
OCDs rose at only a 1 percent rate from July to November.
Althogh demand deposits in 1988 increased sharply at times because
of special factors such as tax payments, on the whole, these deposits
declined at a pace that exceeded last year's runoff. In fact, they were
considerably weaker than would have been expected from past
relationships to interest rates and income, perhaps owing to a greater
business share of these deposits resulting from household shifts to NOW
accounts and to an accelerated movement by corporations toward the use
of fees, rather than compensating balances, to pay for bank services.
Although currency growth slowed a bit from last year's brisk pace,
it nontheless remained surprisingly rapid, outpacing the overall growth
of consumption spending.
M2
M2 growth averaged a strong 9 percent rate over the first four
months of the year before tapering off to as low as 1 percent in
September and October, a pattern shaped generally by changes in the
aggregate's opportunity cost. More recently, M2 growth has rebounded
somewhat from its very slow pace earlier in the fall. Reflecting the
increase in market interest rates, M2 velocity rose, on balance, over
the first three quarters of the year and is likely to advance further in
the current quarter.
Interest rates affected not only the overall movement of M2 but
also its composition, especially among retail-type deposits. Early in
the year, slow adjustment of deposit offering rates, especially those on
more liquid accounts, contributed to the extremely rapid growth in small
time deposits and enabled liquid deposits--MMDAs plus savings deposits
plus OCDs--to post solid gains. As market interest rates began to rise
in the spring, growth in these deposits slowed. The slowdown in the
growth of small time deposits was less pronounced, however, because
yields on retail CDs tend to adjust more quickly than yields on liquid
deposits to changes in market rates. Small time deposits thus opened up
a sizable rate advantage over liquid deposits by midsummer, encouraging
households to shift funds from liquid deposits to retail CDs.
During the year, the growth of small time deposits at banks began
to noticeably exceed their growth at thrift institutions. In the past,
small time deposit growth at thrifts has been above that at banks, as
thrifts typically offered a significant yield premium, and this
relationship continued to prevail through the first half of this year.
Since then, however, the relationship has reversed, partly in response
to a narrowing of the spread between retail CD rates at thrifts and at
banks. This new pricing development has been attributed to the closing
of a number of insolvent saving and loan associations that had been very

III-A-4
aggressive in pricing these accounts and to pressure from the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board on other thrifts to limit their offering rates.
General purpose and broker/dealer money market mutual funds also
contributed to the variation in M2 growth during 1988. The growth of
assets was exceptionally strong in the first quarter, as yields on money
funds fell more slowly than those on Treasury bills. However, with
market rates moving up over the remainder of the year, money funds
experienced outflows in some months and, on balance, showed very little
growth.
Overnight RPs and Eurodollars were subject to large monthly
changes, but on the whole, they declined significantly during the year.
The reasons for this weakness are not clear, but substantial core
deposit growth allowed banks to bid less aggressively for nondeposit
sources of funds, especially overnight funds. The dow ward movement,
most of which occurred in the second half of the year, contributed to
slower M2 growth over that period.
M3
M3 growth in 1988 has been more closely aligned with the growth of
credit at banks and thrifts than it was in 1987, as these institutions
have relied to a lesser extent this year on non-M3 sources of funds.
During the first half of 1988, M3 grew at a rate only slightly below the
7-3/4 percent expansion in bank and thrift credit. Rapid growth in
institution-only money market mutual funds during the first quarter also
boosted M3. The growth of large time deposits, however, was relatively
slow, as core deposits provided institutions with funds to support their
lending activities.
The drop in M3 growth since midyear came in the context of a
slowdown in the expansion of most major loan and investment activities
at banks. M3 growth was further restrained by large increases in
advances from Federal Home Loan Banks to thrift institutions and by
substantial inflows to banks of U.S. government balances during
September and October. Despite the slower growth in bank credit since
mid year, banks stepped up their issuance of large time deposits during
the third quarter to offset partially a slowdown in core deposit growth.
2. Overnight and term RPs were reduced to some extent by several banks
shifting the operations of their government securities dealers
to nonbank subsidiaries of their holding companies. This action was
probably taken in response to decisions made by the Federal Reserve
Board permitting bank holding company subsidiaries to underwrite certain
previously prohibited private and municipal securities, provided that
this activity does not exceed 5 percent of the subsidiary's business.
Since these subsidiaries are not depository institutions, their RPs are
excluded from M2 and M3. Thus far, the impact of these shifts on the
aggregates has been negligible.

III-A-5
Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt
Although the growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt slowed in
1988, as it had in 1987, it still exceeded the growth of nominal GNP.
The federal sector's demand for credit abated slightly, as the deficit
narrowed on a calendar-year basis. More important to the overall
slowdown in debt growth, however, was the decline in debt expansion in
other sectors; the growth of credit demand outside the federal sector
fell to an 8-1/2 percent annual rate from the fourth quarter of last
year through October 1988, down from 10 percent in 1987. This slowdown
occurred in borrowing by state and local governments and in mortgage
borrowing by households, which was restrained by higher interest rates.
Consumer credit rose at about the same rate as last year, which was well
below the extremely rapid rates of the mid-1980s. Business credit also
grew at about last year's pace; within this sector, corporate borrowing
increased sharply, as the financing gap widened and as mergers, buyouts,
and share repurchases led to large retirements of equity. Corporate
demand for credit weakened in the third quarter, in reflection of higher
interest rates and a reduced pace of equity retirements, but corporate
borrowing should strengthen late in the current quarter given the
sizable leveraged acquisitions and buyouts that have occurred recently
or will be completed in coming weeks.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
The merchandise trade deficit for September narrowed to a monthly
rate of $10.5 billion on a seasonally adjusted CIF basis from the August
deficit of $12.3 billion. Valued on a customs basis, which excludes
insurance and freight charges from imports, the deficit was $9.0 billion
in September compared with $10.6 billion in August. Exports continued
to grow in September, with increases recorded in industrial supplies,
capital goods, and consumer goods. About one-third of the decrease in
September imports was due to a fall in the value of oil imports, as both
the volume and the price of imported oil declined from August levels.
Declines in non-oil imports were widespread across major trade
categories, as only the value of automotive products increased in
September.

On a balance-of-payments basis, the trade deficit continued to
improve in the third quarter, registering a deficit of $114 billion (at
a seasonally adjusted annual rate), reflecting higher prices for
agricultural exports and lower prices for oil imports. In real terms,
the third-quarter deficit was little changed from the second-quarter
level.

The value of total exports rose 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter,
somewhat less than in previous quarters. Since the third quarter of
last year, the value of exports has increased almost 27 percent; three-
quarters of this gain has been in volume terms. The volume of
nonagricultural exports increased almost 25 percent over the past year;
but, volume rose only 2 percent in the third quarter, with increases in
exports of capital goods and consumer goods. The value of agricultural
exports increased by almost 8 percent in the third quarter, reflecting a
sharp increase in the prices of agricultural commodities, which was
offset somewhat by a decline in the volume. Export prices for wheat,
corn, and soybeans continued to increase because of the drought in the
United States.

The volume of non-oil imports increased somewhat in the third
quarter but has been fairly flat since the fourth quarter of last year.
In the third quarter, strong increases in the quantity of imported
computers, peripherals and parts, as well as consumer goods were

IV-4
outweighed by declines in nonmonetary gold and aircraft. Prices of non-
oil imports on a GNP fixed-weight basis increased about 3 percent at an
annual rate, less than in recent quarters, reflecting the appreciation
of the dollar between June and August.
The value of oil imports fell about 3-1/2 percent in the third
quarter, as substantial declines in the price of imported oil outweighed
a small increase in oil import volume. In September, the average price
of imported oil was $13.69 per barrel, a decline of about $1.80 per
barrel from the May peak. Prices of imported oil are estimated to have
declined further in October and November, by a total of about $1.00 per
barrel, as OPEC members continued to produce well in excess of quota.
The quantity of oil imported appears to have risen in both October and
November, largely reflected in an increase in oil inventories.

data reported to the Federal Reserve, the outflow slowed in October and
was reversed through the first three weeks of November, showing a small
net inflow on balance since September (line 1 of the International
Banking Table).
Net foreign private purchases of U.S. securities were small in
September (lines 2 and 3 of the Summary Table). There were net sales of
both U.S. corporate equities (line 2b) and U.S. Treasury obligations
(line 3).
Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate bonds remained depressed in
September (see line 2a). New issues of Eurobonds by U.S. corporations
were fairly small in October. Market commentary on the decline in
Eurodollar bond issues has focused on investor uncertainty about the
outlook for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and on concern
about the potential downgrading of U.S. corporate issues because of
restructurings. For October, an estimated 60 percent (approximately
$560 million) of the Eurobonds issued by U.S. corporations was
denominated in foreign currencies; this can be compared with an average
from June through September of 27 percent and only $145 million.
U.S. purchases of foreign securities continued to be moderate in
September (line 2c of the Summary Table). These data do not, however,
reflect the value of the bonds issued in September on behalf of Israel
by a U.S. trust.
Under the provisions of the Foreign Military Sales Debt
Refinancing Act, passed last summer, foreign governments are allowed to
repay relatively high-cost debt to the U.S. government and refinance

that debt by issuing bonds that carry a 90 percent guarantee by the
United States. The government of Israel floated a $2.5 billion issue in
September and a further $2.2 billion at the end of November. In both
cases the Israelis put up collateral equal to 10 percent of the value of
the issue. Turkey is expected to float $1.5 billion in December.
Lesser amounts have been, or are expected to be, issued by 7 to 10 other
countries; by the end of 1989 a total of $8.5 billion is expected to be
refinanced. In terms of balance-of-payments accounting, the repayments
will reduce the U.S. government's claims on foreigners (included in line
8). If the new bonds are sold directly in the United States by a
foreign government, the balancing item would be included in line 2c
(U.S. net purchases of foreign securities); if sold through a trust, as
was the case for the Israeli issues, they would be included in line 8
(other capital flows).
A second development indicating the increased use of U.S. financial
markets by foreign governments is a recently announced plan by the
French government to market French government bonds in the United States
in the form of American Depository Receipts (ADRs). The ADRs are issued
on demand and, from the program's inception in September to the present,
a total of $2.9 million has been sold. Market sources indicate that
other sovereign borrowers are interested in establishing similar
programs, but are waiting to assess the success of the French program.
Foreign official reserve assets held in the United States fell a
moderate $1.7 billion in September (line 4). However, preliminary data
on changes in holdings at FRBNY for October and November indicate that

IV-9
G-10 reserves in the United States have started to increase again,
possibly reflecting the shift in the direction of foreign exchange
market intervention.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average exchange value of the dollar in terms of the
other G-10 currencies has declined about 2 percent, on balance, since
the November FOMC meeting and 8 percent since its peak last August, as
shown in the accompanying chart. Following a pause in late October and
early November, the dollar began to decline again after the U.S.
election, as comments from U.S. observers and foreign officials
reinforced the market's shift in focus toward the U.S. budget and trade
deficits. Market sentiment remained negative on the dollar through most
of the intermeeting period,
Very late in the period, however, the
dollar appeared to be bolstered by expectations of tightening by the
Federal Reserve and the market response to proposed cuts in Soviet armed
forces.
Beginning just before
the last FOMC meeting, the Desk purchased a
significant amount of dollars against yen for the first time since last
April.

against marks.
The Desk purchased a total of about $1.6
billion against yen and $600 million against marks.
Interest differentials between U.S. and foreign short-term assets
generally widened during the intermeeting period. German interest rates
rose somewhat, with the German three-month rate and the average of long-
term bond yields both increasing about 15 basis points. Interest rates
fell in Japan, with the three-month rate decreasing 10 basis points and
the yield of the bellwether bond falling 20 basis points. In the United
Kingdom, the three-month rate rose more than 1 percentage point as the
Bank of England raised its money market dealing rate 1 percentage point
to just below 13 percent, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Lawson stated
that a strong pound and higher U.K. interest rates are needed to combat
inflation. Sterling rose more than 2 percent against the mark, to above
3.23 marks per pound.
The Canadian dollar experienced wide swings during the intermeeting
period. During the early part of the period, voter opinion polls
showing strong support for the Liberal party before the parliamentary
elections caused the Canadian dollar to fall sharply. On November 21,
the day of the election, new polls surfaced showing the Conservative
party regaining the lead, and the Canadian dollar's value soared. Since
the election, the positive trend for the Canadian dollar has continued,
partly based on the imminent passage of the U.S.-Canada free trade pact
which is expected to increase foreign investment in Canada.

IV-12
Oil prices rose after Thanksgiving, when OPEC reached an agreement
on production quotas. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate
crude oil rose, on balance, $2 since the last FOMC meeting, to about
$15-1/2. The price of gold followed oil prices upward, increasing $11,
on balance, to about $423 an ounce.
Developments in the Foreign Industrial Countries
Real economic activity accelerated or remained strong in most of
the major foreign economies in the third quarter. After declining 3.3
percent in the second quarter, real GNP rose 9.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
Japan in the third quarter, based on growth of 7.4 percent in domestic
demand and a positive contribution to growth from the external sector.
German real GNP rose 5.2 percent, led by both strong exports and private
investment, while the output measure of real GDP in the United Kingdom
rose 5.3 percent. French real marketable GDP rose 3.2 percent, about
twice the second-quarter pace, based on strength in consumer spending
but with a large negative contribution of net exports. In contrast,
growth slowed in Canada in the third quarter, as real GDP increased 2.6
percent compared with 4 percent growth in the second quarter. Canadian
consumption remained strong, but investment spending slackened. Little
information is available yet for the fourth quarter, but initial
indicators suggest growth has perhaps slowed somewhat in Japan, Canada,
and France.
Signs of increasing price pressures have appeared in recent months
in some of the major foreign economies. In Japan and Germany, inflation
remains low, with consumer prices in October and November about 1-1/2

IV-16
percent above a year ago. Consumer prices rose sharply in Italy in
November to 5.2 percent above a year earlier, but inflation changed
little in October in Canada and France from the moderate rates
experienced in recent months. Consumer price inflation remains high in
the United Kingdom at 6.4 percent in October from a year earlier, and
inflation concerns there have been heightened by evidence of continued
strength in domestic demand.
External adjustment has slowed in recent months and in some cases
may even have reversed. Japan's trade surplus widened in September and
October in both nominal and real terms. German trade and current
account surpluses for the first ten months of 1988 are slightly larger
than those for the comparable period in 1987. Trade deficits widened in
some of the other major foreign industrial economies. In October, the
U.K. trade and current account deficits reached record levels, and the
French and Italian trade deficits also increased.
Individual country notes. In Japan, the pace of real economic
activity was robust in the third quarter after a weak second quarter.
Real GNP grew 9.3 percent (s.a.a.r.), based on growth of domestic demand
of 7.4 percent, with net exports making a positive contribution.
Personal consumption, private capital spending, and exports were the
primary sources of strength. Real consumer spending grew 5.8 percent
while plant and equipment investment rose 18.6 percent. The strength of
the external sector derived from rapid growth in exports of 41.3 percent
offset by a slower but still strong rise in imports of 27.7 percent.
Residential investment also was strong, growing 26.5 percent. Public

IV-I7
investment, which fell 7 percent, and slower stock accumulation were the
only sources of weakness.
Available data for the fourth quarter suggest some slowing of
growth from the rapid third-quarter pace. Preliminary data indicate
industrial production (s.a.) fell 0.8 percent in October, although the
level of production was still 6.6 percent above a year ago.
Consumer price inflation remains low, but has increased in the
fourth quarter. The Tokyo index of consumer prices in October and
November averaged 1.6 percent above a year ago, twice the increase in
the third quarter. Higher prices for food and clothing are cited as the
primary source of the increase in consumer prices.
Data show a widening of Japan's external surplus in recent months,
partly reversing previous progress on external adjustment. In the third
quarter, the 5.6 percent growth of export volume (s.a.) outstripped the
2.6 percent increase in import volume, and in October the 6.5 percent
decline in import volume was twice the decline in export volume. The
nominal trade surplus (in dollars) increased in September and October,
contributing to the cumulative surplus in the first ten months of 1988
of $75 billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with a surplus of $79.5 billion in
1987. The current account through October was $79.4 billion (s.a.a.r.),
compared with a surplus of $87 billion in 1987.
The rate of growth of broad money remains rapid. In October,
M2+CDs stood 11 percent higher than a year earlier, a slightly higher
increase than in the third quarter. The Bank of Japan expects money
growth to slow in November. In September, the Bank had projected that

IV-18
growth in M2+CDs would average about 10 percent in the fourth quarter,
but it now appears likely that actual growth will exceed that
projection.
The Liberal Democratic Party achieved a major breakthrough in the
Diet debate over tax reform, and final passage of the bill, including
the controversial 3 percent VAT (to be imposed in April 1989), now
appears assured. The LDP reached a compromise with two opposition
parties in which the latter ended their boycott of the debate in return
for the establishment of a special Diet committee to investigate the
Recruit Cosmos insider trading scandal. The tax reform bill should be
passed by the Upper House in December.
Economic activity accelerated in Germany in the third quarter,
following a flat second quarter. Real GNP increased 5.2 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter. The gain was led by strength in net
exports, but all components of demand, except construction, advanced
briskly. Overall, net exports accounted for about 40 percent of GNP
growth and domestic demand 60 percent. However, the 5.2 percent growth
rate was boosted by weather-related factors in the first half of the
year and statistical factors relating to working-days in the third
quarter. Compared with its year-earlier level, real GNP was up 3.4
percent in the third quarter.
Monthly data on production and new orders were varied sharply as a
result of an abnormal pattern of summer holidays, but smoothed data show
a pickup in activity. For example, industrial production increased 0.7
percent (s.a.) in the September-October period from the July-August

IV-19
average. Also, manufacturers' new orders rose 3.5 percent (s.a.) in
real terms from the second to the third quarter, with domestic orders up
3.8 percent and foreign orders up 2.9 percent.
As a result of the expansion, the unemployment rate fell by 0.1
percentage point to 8.5 percent (s.a.) in November, the fourth
consecutive monthly decline, and the number of part-time workers was
down by about one-half from its year-earlier level. Capacity
utilization reached its highest rate in 10 years in the third quarter.
While the high utilization rate has raised some concern in Germany
about future inflation, German inflation rates remain moderate. The
consumer price index rose 0.2 percent (n.s.a.) in November and stands
1.6 percent above its November 1987 level, up from 1.4 percent in
September. Wholesale prices increased 0.4 percent (n.s.a.) in October
and are 2 percent above their year-earlier level, the same as in
September. Import prices, which had contributed to inflation earlier by
rising 3.3 percent between March and August, fell 0.9 percent between
August and October.
The monthly trade and current account surpluses (n.s.a.) narrowed
in September but widened in October from their year-earlier levels. As
a result, for the first 10 months of the year, the trade surplus was up
from $51.4 billion in 1987 to $57.7 billion in 1988, while the current
account surplus was up from $34.1 billion to $36.7 billion. Comparing
the first eight months of 1987 and 1988, Germany's trade surplus with
the U.S. was down 38 percent, from $8.6 billion to $5.3 billion, while

IV-20
its surplus with other EC countries was up 43 percent, from $20.9
billion to $29.9 billion.
Growth in the average level of M3 was rapid again in September and
October, putting M3 at 6.8 percent above the target base period of 1987
Q4 and outside the 3 to 6 percent target range for 1988. Thus, 1988 is
likely to mark the third successive year that money growth exceeds the
Bundesbank's target range. Meanwhile, the pickup in economic growth has
caused the government to revise downward its projections of the total
public sector budget deficit, which it now estimates at 2.8 percent of
GNP in 1988 and 2 percent in 1989. In addition, the government has
postponed for three years the application of tax withholding on accrued
bond interest. This action does not affect the government's plan to
introduce 10 percent withholding on the coupon payment of interest on
domestic bonds in 1989.
In the United Kingdom, recent data have provided further evidence
of overheating. The output measure of real GDP increased by 5.3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter. The volume of retail sales increased
by 1.9 percent (s.a.) in October and showed a 12-month increase of 7.1
percent. The unemployment rate declined for the 27th consecutive month
in October to 7.7 percent (s.a.). The 12-month rate of consumer price
inflation rose to 6.4 percent in October, the eighth consecutive monthly
increase.
The trade and current account deficits were at record levels in
October. For the first 10 months of the year, the current account

IV-21
deficit was $25.7 billion (s.a.a.r.), far exceeding the $1.5 billion
deficit rate in the same period last year.
On November 1, the government released its autumn statement on the
economy containing revised economic forecasts and spending plans.
(Changes in taxes and monetary targets are normally announced in the
March budget message.) Spending plans remained virtually unchanged.
Forecasts of real GDP growth, inflation, and the current account deficit
for this year were revised upward substantially compared with forecasts
contained in the March budget. The official outlook for next year is
for somewhat lower real growth and inflation and a slightly reduced
current account deficit compared with 1988.
On November 25, the government further tightened monetary
conditions in response to stronger evidence of domestic overheating.
The Bank of England's money market dealing rates were increased by 1
percentage point to 12-7/8 percent. Over the past six months, official
rates have been raised nine times for a total of 5-1/2 percentage
points.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
In his inaugural address on December 1, Mexican President Salinas
de Gortari called for new negotiations on Mexico's external debt in
order to reduce both the total debt and the net transfer of financial
resources abroad. Financing arrangements in Brazil proceeded on
schedule with the country paying its remaining interest arrears. The
mid-November municipal elections weakened Brazilian President Sarney's
political position further. Late in October the World Bank approved

IV-22
$1.25 billion in loans for Argentina and in mid-November the Inter-
American Development Bank approved approximately $460 million in loans.
Discussions are still continuing with the IMF on a new stand-by
arrangement for Argentina. Venezuela's new president, Carlos Andres
Perez, plans to move quickly to renegotiate the terms of repayment of
his country's commercial bank debt. Peru, facing possible
hyperinflation, implemented a new economic package on November 23,
including a 50 percent devaluation of its currency and additional wage
and price increases.
Individual country notes. In his inaugural address on December 1,
Mexico's new president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, called for new
negotiations on the country's external debt with the aim of reducing the
net transfer of financial resources abroad and the stock of external
debt. He said that he wanted to continue avoiding confrontation, but
that the interests of the Mexican people were more important than those
of the creditors. He stressed that economic growth had to be revived
and that this could not happen so long as the country continues to
transfer annually 5 percent of its GDP abroad.
Since the October 17 announcement that the U.S. Treasury and the
Federal Reserve were prepared to advance a bridge loan of up to $3.5
billion to Mexico, little progress has been made by Mexico in developing
the IMF and World Bank programs upon which the U.S. bridge loan is to
depend. However, now that the new Mexican administration is in place,
movement is expected.

IV-23
In the past seven weeks, Mexican foreign exchange reserves have
continued to decline. A trade deficit of about $80 million was incurred
in September, in part because Hurricane Gilbert reduced the volume of
crude oil exported during the month by 25 percent. This was the first
monthly trade deficit since March 1982. In October, the CPI was less
than 1 percent higher than a month earlier, and 82 percent higher than a
year earlier. Since the Mexican authorities announced on October 16
that they were tightening monetary policy, the 28-day Treasury bill rate
has increased by nearly 900 basis points. At the November 29 auction,
it was 52.2 percent at an annual rate.
In Brazil, the Democratic Movement Party registered a poor showing
throughout the country in mid-November municipal elections. The
political center, including President Sarney, was weakened by the
elections, although the most extreme parties on the left and right did
not achieve major gains. The election results may make it more
difficult for President Sarney to implement his legislative agenda even
though the membership of Congress was not affected by the elections.
On November 4 Brazil received $2 billion from its 1987 Interim
Financing Arrangement with commercial banks. On November 14 it received
an additional $4 billion from the $5.2 billion new money package that
was signed on November 1; part of these funds were used to pay off the
Interim Arrangement. Brazil has now paid its remaining interest arrears
to commercial banks and is current on its interest obligations for the
first time since February 1987, when the country declared a moratorium
on interest payments on medium-term debts to banks.

Consumer prices rose 27 percent in November, after rising the same
amount in October and 24 percent in September. Inflation would likely
have been even higher in November except for the "social pact" agreement
between business, labor, and government reached on November 4 that
mandated maximum price increases of 26.5 percent for November and 25
percent for December on a list of commonly used commodities. Interest
rates in the overnight market have remained below 40 percent on a
monthly basis in recent weeks. The spread between the official and
parallel market exchange rates has fluctuated in the 55 to 65 percent
range recently.
Brazil's trade surplus was $1.6 billion in October--down from a
surplus of $1.9 billion in September--but still setting a record pace
for the year as a whole. The surplus for the first ten months of 1988
was $16.1 billion, substantially larger than any annual figure in
Brazilian history.
Next month the authorities are planning to introduce a tourist
exchange rate in an effort to close the gap between the official and
parallel market rates. Finance Ministry officials indicated that this
move marked the start of a process toward easing controls that could
lead eventually to freely determined exchange rates.
On October 27, 1988, the World Bank approved $1.25 billion in loans
to Argentina, including a $400 million banking sector loan, a $300
million trade sector loan, a $300 million housing project loan, and a
$250 million power sector loan. The trade sector loan became effective
November 15, 1988, allowing a first disbursement of $150 million to be

IV-25
made. The Inter-American Development Bank approved $459 million in
power sector, water, and agricultural loans in mid-November. On
November 22, the first disbursement of $150 million from the U.S.
Treasury and the BIS loans bridged to the World Bank loans was drawn.
Because the first disbursement of the bridge loan was tied to the
effectiveness of the fast-disbursing trade sector loan, $60 million of
the disbursements of the bridge loan were repaid the following day.
Talks on a new IMF stand-by arrangement are continuing.
Inflation has continued to decline following implementation of the
stabilization plan announced in August 1988. Consumer price inflation
decelerated from 27.6 percent in August (monthly basis) to 11.7 percent
in September, and to 9.1 percent in October. However, widespread strike
activity on the part of public sector workers in October and November
has forced the government to make wage concessions to some unions in
excess of the government's 4 percent monthly guideline. At the same
time, the increasing real appreciation of the exchange rate is
heightening the probability of a destructive flight out of australs and
into dollars. In order to forestall such an event, the central bank
responded to a surge in the demand for dollars in mid-November by
announcing a rise in the basic government bond rate and other measures
to tighten liquidity. It also announced an increase in official dollar
sales in an effort to reduce the free market premium. The trade surplus
has improved substantially in 1988, registering $1.7 billion in the
first seven months of this year, 171 percent higher than in the same
period last year.

Venezuela's presidential election on December 4 was won by Carlos
Andres Perez, the candidate of the left-of-center Democratic Action
Party. Perez served previously as president from 1974 to 1979 and at
that time promoted a statist populism. More recently he has supported
economic liberalization, and his advisors expect him to implement a
major program of economic stabilization and structural reform soon after
he is inaugurated in February. Perez has also indicated that he plans
to move quickly to renegotiate the terms of repayment of Venezuela's
commercial bank debt. To stabilize liquid reserves for a few months in
the face of continued large balance-of-payments deficits, the current
Venezuelan government has asked the Bank of America and Salomon Brothers
to raise $1 billion through the private sale of future oil export
receivables.
Peru is currently in the midst of an economic crisis. Several
public sector price increases and devaluations over the past year have
failed to reduce the government's budget deficit and restore
international competitiveness. Wage increases have also accompanied
price hikes. On November 23 the government announced further price and
wage increases and devalued the exchange rate by 50 percent. A few days
after the package was announced, the finance minister resigned,
reportedly because the package contemplates insufficient adjustment.
The CPI increased by 114 percent in September over the previous month,
41 percent in October, and 24 percent in November. Prices in November
were 1,300 percent higher than they were in November 1987. The recent
economic package is expected to add to the social unrest that followed

IV-27
September's austerity program. Aside from President Garcia, there is a
general consensus that a more effective economic program is needed.
On November 30, the IMF Managing Director announced that the Fund
and Nigeria had reached an agreement on Nigeria's SDR 475 million, 15-
month, stand-by arrangement. The stand-by will facilitate the approval
of a $500 million World Bank Trade and Investment Policy Loan and will
also pave the way for a Paris Club rescheduling early next year.
