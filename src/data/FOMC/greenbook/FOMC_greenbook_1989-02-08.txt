The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The economy remained fairly strong in the fourth quarter. Gains in
employment were sizable through December, and the estimated rise in real GNP
for the quarter was 3 percent at an annual rate, after adjusting for the
drought losses in agriculture. Although business investment and net exports
weakened somewhat, consumer spending continued to grow at a substantial
pace, and housing activity also was strong. Price inflation in recent
months has been running in about the same range as over the past year, but,
against the backdrop of tightening labor markets, the trends in labor costs
have continued to deteriorate.
Labor Market Developments
Payroll employment rose 280,000 in December, and monthly increases
over the quarter averaged more than 300,000. Manufacturing employment
surged last quarter, after a flat third quarter, and job gains in services
continued to be sizable. The increase in manufacturing was concentrated in
durable goods industries, especially in machinery and some materials
industries where order backlogs have been rising. The gains in nonfarm
employment, coupled with an increase in the workweek, resulted in fourth-
quarter growth in production worker hours of 3.5 percent at an annual rate.
The civilian unemployment rate was 5.3 percent in December--matching the low
for the current expansion. Initial claims for unemployment insurance rose a
bit around the end of 1988 and into early 1989, but then dropped back again
in mid-January; similar ups and downs often have been observed at this time
of year and may reflect difficulties of seasonal adjustment through the
holiday period.

Employment growth in the household survey fell short of that in the
payroll survey in the fourth quarter, as it did through much of 1988; over
the year, household employment was up 2-1/4 million, while the number of
payroll jobs rose more than 3-1/2 million. This gap is large by historical
standards, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been unable to establish
the sources of the difference. In any event, both surveys show employment
rising faster than the growth of the labor force and suggest that activity
in 1988 probably continued to be more rapid than can be sustained over the
long haul.
The tightening of labor markets has been accompanied by an acceleration
in labor costs. Total private compensation, as measured by the Employment
Cost Index, rose at a 4-3/4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter (based
on data that have been seasonally adjusted by the Board's staff) and
advanced nearly 5 percent over the year as a whole, after rising 3-1/4
percent in 1987. Both the wage and benefit components of compensation costs
accelerated in 1988. Wages and salaries grew a bit more than 4 percent in
1988--about 3/4 of a percentage point above the pace in 1987. Meanwhile,
benefit costs jumped sharply last year, rising 6-3/4 percent, after a
3-1/2 percent increase in 1987.
About one-fourth of the acceleration in hourly compensation in 1988
reflected the hike in the social security tax rate that took effect last
January. The remainder--amounting to about 1-1/4 percentage points--seems
to have resulted largely from the tightening of labor markets, which is
forcing employers either to boost wages or to add more generous benefit
packages if they are to attract and retain workers. Among blue-collar
workers, and in the goods-producing sector, the acceleration in hourly

compensation last year was entirely in the form of increased benefits. In
contrast, white-collar workers, and those in the service-producing sector,
saw a big pickup in both benefits and wages; it is in these areas that
unemployment rates currently are the lowest and in which the anecdotal
evidence of labor shortages have been the most frequent.
Among the components of benefits, the rise in the cost of insurance
benefits was especially rapid--more than 11 percent over the year, according
to estimates derived from unpublished BLS reports. Some firms reportedly
have added medical insurance benefits to their compensation packages in
order to attract workers. The increases in most other types of benefits
also were rapid in 1988, the only major exception being the contributions to
employee retirement plans; because these plans have been well-funded,
employers were able to trim their contributions in 1988.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Total industrial production was up 0.3 percent in December, bringing
the gain for the fourth quarter as a whole to 4.2 percent at an annual rate.
Sharp increases in assemblies of motor vehicles boosted the output of both
consumer goods and business equipment last quarter. Production of nonauto
consumer goods also continued to advance briskly. In contrast, output of
business equipment turned sluggish, in part reflecting a steep drop in the
output of computing machines, which constitute about one-fourth of the
business equipment index. Apart from motor vehicles and computers,
production of capital goods continued to rise in the fourth quarter,
although much less rapidly than over the first three quarters of the year.
Output of materials increased 5 percent at an annual rate during the fourth
quarter, down about 3 percentage points from the third-quarter advance.

Output of durable and nondurable materials continued to post strong gains,
but the production of energy materials declined, as a drop in electricity
generation last quarter retraced most of the increase posted during last
summer's heat wave.
Recent data on durable goods orders suggest that the growth in
industrial production is likely to be maintained in the near term. In
particular, orders surged toward year-end for metals, some construction
materials, and household durables. For manufacturing as a whole, the
strength in these orders more than offset the sluggishness in bookings for
nondefense capital goods in the last two months of 1988.1
Capacity utilization in manufacturing increased nearly 1/2 percentage
point during the fourth quarter, to 84-1/2 percent. Over the four quarters
of 1988, the manufacturing operating rate climbed another 2 percentage
points, after a rise of 2-1/2 percentage points in 1987; factory utilization
in the fourth quarter was at the highest level since 1979. The operating
rate for primary processing industries rose 1-1/4 percentage points last
year, to 88-1/4 percent, and the utilization rate for advanced processing
industries gained 2-1/2 percentage points last year to 82-1/2 percent. The
rise in the operating rates over the past year has been accompanied by
continued rapid increases in the prices of intermediate materials and a
marked acceleration in the prices of manufactured goods.
1. Orders for durable goods tend to lead industrial production by about
two months, on average, if one uses an orders series that excludes those
industries in which orders are identical to shipments and therefore do not
provide any lead information, or in industries in which the lead times are
so long, as in the case of aircraft and defense industries, as to have
little practical value for predicting near-term activity levels. The
adjusted durables orders series plotted in the attached chart refers to
total orders excluding defense capital goods and nondefense aircraft.

Personal Income and Consumption
Although retail sales have shown a good deal of month-to-month
variability of late, the trend in consumption spending still looks quite
strong. In real terms, total personal consumption expenditures rose nearly
3 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. Spending for household
durables rose vigorously as did the outlays for other discretionary items
such as boats and aircraft. Outlays for services are estimated to have
advanced at an annual rate of 3-3/4 percent, reflecting big increases in
real spending for medical care, airline travel, and recreation.
Expenditures on motor vehicles surged in December, but were little changed
for the fourth quarter as a whole. Spending for nondurables rose moderately
in the fourth quarter, after a steep rise in the previous period.
The overall strength of consumer spending has been buttressed by
sizable gains in income. Real disposable personal income was up 0.7 percent
in December and increased at an annual rate of 4-3/4 percent in the fourth
quarter, boosted by hefty gains in wages and salaries, a rapid rise in
interest income, and another round of big government subsidies to farmers.
With income gains outstripping the growth of consumer spending, the saving
rate moved up almost 1/2 percentage point in the fourth quarter, to 4.6
percent.
Consumption expenditures, in real terms, rose 3-1/2 percent over the
four quarters of 1988--a much bigger rise than in 1987--and there is little
in the recent data to suggest that growth of consumption will move to a
significantly lower trajectory in the near term. Indeed, in view of the
continued strong growth of real income, favorable readings on consumer
sentiment, and the recent run-up in the stock market, it appears that

consumers are positioned to keep spending on an upward course in the near
term.
Autos and Trucks
Domestic production of automobiles was 8-1/4 million units at an
annual rate (BEA seasonals) in December and was scheduled at 7-3/4 million
in January. Meanwhile, sales of domestically produced cars have been
unusually volatile--soaring to 8.4 million units in December and falling to
6 million in the first 20 days of January. Some of the recent swing in
sales apparently reflected large fleet purchases in December that may have
"borrowed" from January. Moreover, some incentive programs had been
scheduled to expire at the end of 1988 and probably contributed to a
bunching of purchases at year-end.
Because the strong sales pace in December about matched the high level
of production, inventories of domestically produced cars did not rise
further from the elevated November level. However, stocks probably built up
further in January. In light of the relatively high level of inventories,
automakers have introduced a new round of incentive plans. Looking ahead,
it seems likely that production plans will be trimmed as the first quarter
progresses and that incentive plans will be expanded further.
Business Fixed Investment
Real spending for business fixed investment fell 3-3/4 percent at an
annual rate in the fourth quarter, according to BEA's advance estimate,
relecting declines for both equipment structures. However, the estimate for
structures is likely to be revised up as the result of strong December gains
that were reported after the release of the GNP data. Over the four
quarters of 1988, equipment spending increased 10 percent; most of the

growth came in the first half of the year, when there was a surge in
spending for computers. Outlays for nonresidential structures declined in
1988, reflecting softness in virtually all major categories.
New bookings for nondefense capital goods fell 1 percent in the fourth
quarter, despite strong gains in aircraft orders in November and December;
excluding aircraft and parts, new orders were down 3-1/4 percent for the
quarter. The office and computing equipment market remains the area of most
pronounced weakness. Industry sources have indicated that the rapid
increase in computer orders earlier in the year was largely in the PC and
workstation end of the market, as businesses substituted desktop equipment
for larger minicomputers. More recently, trade reports have suggested that
uncertainty about price developments and potential new technical standards
in the desktop market have led many firms to postpone new computer
purchases. If these reports are correct, then the computer market likely
will rebound--although the timing of any such turnaround is subject to
considerable uncertainty.
In addition to the softness in the demand for computing equipment, new
bookings for other equipment--especially communication equipment and other
types of nonelectrical machinery--also have weakened somewhat. However,
orders have remained above shipments in recent months--though the gap
narrowed toward year-end--and the existing backlog of unfilled orders is
likely to support further advances in shipments in the near term.
With regard to structures, spending in the fourth quarter was down for
drilling structures and commercial buildings other than offices; industrial
construction picked up, after little change earlier in the year. Looking
ahead, it seems likely that the trend in spending for nonresidential

construction will be relatively flat in 1989, as the value of new
nonresidential construction contracts has been stuck on a plateau for some
time. In addition, petroleum drilling activity, as measured by the number
of rigs in use, declined in the fourth quarter and continued to fall in the
first three weeks of January; a firming of activity is possible, however, if
oil prices hold in the higher range of recent months.
The Commerce Department's survey of plant and equipment spending, taken
in October and November, indicates that capital spending will continue to
rise this year, albeit at a slower pace than in 1988. Firms expected to
increase nominal outlays 6 percent this year, after an estimated 10-1/2
percent rise in 1988. The expectations are similar to the spending plans
reported earlier in the private surveys. Much of the slowdown is expected
to occur in manufacturing, where the Commerce Department survey shows a rise
in spending next year of 4-1/4 percent, compared with a 12-3/4 percent
estimated gain for 1988. Nonetheless, these spending plans in manufacturing
still translate into further increases in capacity, as it is the level of
investment, not the change, that influences the growth of the capital stock.
Taken at face value, the surveys suggest that the weakness observed
currently in the near-term data will prove temporary; although a wide
confidence interval must be put around the fall Commerce survey forecast, it
has in the past provided an unbiased estimate of business fixed investment.
Business Inventories
Business inventory investment slowed somewhat, on average, in October
and November; in 1982 prices, stocks in all manufacturing and trade rose at
an average annual rate of $19.7 billion in the October-November period,
compared with a $25.5 billion accumulation in the third quarter. Much of

the recent stockbuilding has occurred at auto dealers; elsewhere, inventory
accumulation has been small on balance, suggesting that businesses continue
to take a cautious approach to inventory investment.
In manufacturing, recent inventory buildups occurred mainly in
industries producing capital equipment and production materials and
supplies--such as primary metals, machinery, aircraft, chemicals, and rubber
and plastics. A similar pattern was evident through much of last year. For
most manufacturing industries, inventory-shipments ratios at the end of
November were near the low end of the range set over the past year. In the
nonauto trade sector, wholesalers' stocks, on net, rose only slightly in
October and November, as buildups in inventories of machinery, electrical
goods, and metals were nearly offset by drawdowns in farm products and
petroleum stocks. At the retail level, increases in nonauto inventories
generally have kept pace with growth in sales. In particular, at general
merchandise and apparel stores, where stocks became a bit burdensome during
the holiday season last year, inventories appeared to be under control this
year. The November inventory-sales ratios for these two types of stores
were below the levels reported last winter and early last spring.
Housing Markets
Residential construction moved up in the fourth quarter. Total housing
starts climbed to a 1.54 million unit annual rate, owing largely to a
strengthening in single-family construction. Building permit issuance, a
roughly coincident and less volatile indicator of the onset of construction,
also firmed last quarter. Sales of houses in the resale market were up
about 4 percent for the quarter, reflecting a surge in sales in December.

II-26
Sales of new homes through November remained close to the healthy third-
quarter pace.
The rise in mortgage interest rates late in 1988, only some of which
has been reversed by recent declines, is likely to exert some restraint on
homebuilding in the period ahead. On net, the rates on conventional fixed-
rate mortgages rose about 1/2 percentage point from early November to late
January. Although an easing in the demand for single-family homes thus
seems likely in the early months of 1989, some rescheduling of construction
activity owing to unusually moderate winter weather could bolster starts
temporarily in this market segment.
In the multifamily sector, starts were little changed in December at
410,000 units (SAAR), close to the average pace for the year as a whole.
However, multifamily construction in 1988 dropped 14 percent below the 1987
total and was one-third less than the average of the 1983-87 period.
Vacancy rates on multifamily units remain elevated in the South, despite
some easing from the record-high levels of 1987. Vacancy rates have turned
up in the Northeast over the past year, but have declined sharply in the
West. On balance, the outlook for activity in the multifamily market
appears weak.
The past year was marked by further changes in the regional mix of
housing activity. In the Northeast, starts of single-family units fell 12
percent, inventories of unsold new homes rose, and the uptrend in home
prices slowed considerably. Double-digit rates of increase in new home
prices during earlier years of the current expansion likely spurred
speculative construction and some over-building in that region. Meanwhile,
price increases also resulted in sharply reduced housing affordability,

which likely depressed demand in the Northeast. Starts of single-family
homes also eased in the South and Midwest regions in 1988. By contrast, the
West recorded a modest increase in single-family housing starts in 1988, and
price increases for both new and existing homes have picked up in that
region in recent quarters; to date, inventories of new homes in the West
have remained well-aligned with sales.
Federal Government
Total real purchases of goods and services by the federal government,
excluding those of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), rose at an annual
rate of 7 percent in the fourth quarter, a departure from the gradual
downtrend seen in previous quarters. Nondefense purchases, which have
fluctuated around a plateau since late 1987, were little changed in the
fourth quarter. In the case of defense, annual budget appropriations,
adjusted for inflation, have declined since fiscal year 1985. Defense
purchases, which lag appropriations, have been volatile in recent quarters
and indeed posted a sizable rise in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, these
purchases were down 3-1/4 percent from a year earlier.
The total budget deficit for December was about $11 billion, bringing
the deficit for the first quarter of fiscal year 1989 to $67 billion. This
was about equal to the deficit over similar periods of each of the last two
fiscal years, if allowance is made for shifts in fiscal 1988 in the timing
of social security payments. On the spending side, net interest payments
and outlays for deposit insurance are running substantially higher than the
year-earlier figures--and the full effect of the FSLIC activities at the end
of December may not have been fully reflected in the monthly data. Receipts
in the first quarter of the fiscal year 1989 were 8 percent higher than a

year earlier. The level and composition of receipts still are being
affected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986; corporate income taxes were 18
percent higher than a year earlier, while personal income taxes were up only
about 7 percent.
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) have released revised budget estimates for the current fiscal
year. OMB now projects a deficit of $160 billion, up sharply from its July
estimate of $133 billion. Higher estimates for outlays for deposit
insurance and net interest payments largely were responsible for the upward
revision. CBO also revised its summertime estimate from $148 billion to
$155 billion, with a $5 billion increase for net interest and a $7 billion
increase for deposit insurance being partially offset by slightly higher
revenues. For fiscal year 1990, OMB projects a current-services deficit of
$127 billion. The Reagan Administration proposed to reduce this deficit to
$92.5 billion through $26 billion in outlay reductions, $2 billion in tax
increases, and $6 billion in asset sales. In contrast, CBO projects a
current services deficit in fiscal year 1990 of $141 billion. (The Reagan
Administration's proposals and the CBO analysis are presented in greater
detail in an appendix.)
State and Local Government Sector
BEA's advance estimates show real purchases of goods and services by
state and local governments up at about a 4 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter, substantially above the 1 percent pace during the summer.
Part of the fourth-quarter gain reflected a 9 percent increase in real
construction spending; newly-available data for December indicate that
construction was even stronger than shown in the advance GNP figures.

Nevertheless, gains in construction spending in the past two years have
fallen short of the 8 percent per year increases from 1984 to 1986.
There continue to be reports of increased demands for investment in
state and local infrastructure, perhaps reflecting a shortfall in the stock
of capital relative to the services demanded by constituents. After
trending upward at a fairly steady pace over much of the postwar period, the
real net stock of public capital (including federally owned, nonmilitary
capital, which constitutes 17 percent of the total) has changed little, on
balance, in the 1980s, although there has been a slight upturn since 1984.
The stocks of educational facilities per student, and highways and streets
per capita, are down slightly from earlier highs, while the capital stock of
water supply systems and sewers has continued to edge up.
The advance in public construction between 1984 and 1986 was
facilitated by the healthy fiscal position of state and local governments in
the early years of the expansion, coupled with increased issuance of public-
purpose municipal bonds. However, in the last two years, new funds raised
through issuance of public-purpose, tax-exempt debt have slackened, and many
governments have experienced an erosion of fiscal positions. Indeed, the
operating and capital accounts deficit for all state and local governments
(excluding social insurance funds) swelled further in the fourth quarter. It
is estimated that 30 states will be ending fiscal year 1989 with relatively
weak positions in their general funds, compared with about 15 states in the
two preceding fiscal years. Many of the states with fiscal problems have
relatively strong economies, as measured by state unemployment rates. In
these states, much of the fiscal distress appears to have resulted from
aggressive spending programs and estimates of revenue that were too

II-33
optimistic. In the remaining 10 states, most notably including the energy
states, poor fiscal situations appear to reflect weak economic performance.
To cope with the fiscal tightness, many states have proposed spending curbs.
Several states also are considering ways to raise receipts, focusing on
highway user charges and alcohol and cigarette taxes, rather than changes in
general sales and income taxes.
Prices
Price inflation generally held steady toward the end of 1988, at a
somewhat elevated pace relative to recent years. Producer prices of
finished goods increased 0.3 percent in November and 0.4 percent in
December, and the CPI for all urban consumers rose 0.3 percent in both
months. Over the year as a whole, the CPI rose 4-1/2 percent, the same as
in 1987. The PPI for finished goods advanced 4 percent last year, nearly 2
percentage points more than in the preceding year. In both the CPI and PPI,
food prices picked up markedly last year, as a result of the drought, while
energy prices decelerated after their 1987 rebound. Price acceleration at
the producer level in 1988 was sharp for finished goods other than food and
energy, and a pickup also was evident at the consumer level for other goods
and services.
Upward pressures on retail food prices have eased markedly since the
summer. The CPI for food rose 0.1 percent in November and 0.3 percent in
December, as further increases for dairy and cereal and bakery products were
partly offset by declines for meats and poultry. At the farm level, crude
food prices dropped back sharply in November, but part of this decline was
retraced in December. As of late January, the futures quotations for major
livestock and crop commodities were indicating little net change, on

average, in the prices of crude foods over this coming year. However, with
stocks of most crops much lower than in recent years, prices in coming
months are likely to be unusually sensitive to the weather and to other
factors affecting production or demand; indeed, wheat prices in particular
have shown some upward pressure in response to the persistence of dry
weather in a number of farming areas.
Retail energy prices were virtually flat in the fourth quarter and over
the year as a whole. In December, increases for fuel oil and electricity
were more than offset by a 1-1/2 percent decline in gasoline prices, as
gasoline supplies were replenished after disruptions during the summer. The
decline in gasoline prices occurred despite a sharp pickup in crude oil
costs, and refiners' margins were brought down markedly. Both spot and
posted prices of crude oil have moved up substantially further since
December, and the higher cost of crude oil will likely show up in retail
prices of petroleum products in coming months.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose 0.3 percent in November
and December. Retail apparel prices retreated somewhat, after sharp
increases in the preceding two months, but prices were up for most other
goods and services. At the producer level, prices of consumer goods other
than food and energy jumped 0.7 percent in December, reflecting large gains
for tobacco products, women's apparel, and passenger cars.
The CPI excluding food and energy rose 4-1/2 percent during 1988,
continuing the modest acceleration that has been under way since early 1987.
Consumer prices for nonfood, nonenergy goods rose 4 percent, the second
consecutive year of about 1/2 percentage point acceleration. Price

II-36
increases for apparel and new cars--of about 5 and 2 percent respectively--
were similar to those in the preceding year. However, price rises
accelerated for a variety of other goods, notably for household items,
medical care, personal care, and recreational goods. The CPI for nonenergy
services was up 5 percent, also 1/2 percentage point above the increase in
1987.
The acceleration in consumer prices excluding food and energy in 1987
had reflected the effect of rising import prices; but this past year it has
been influenced by the direct and indirect effects of the pickup in domestic
labor costs. This is evidenced most clearly by the producer price index,
which measures prices of domestically produced goods. Producer prices for
finished goods (nonfood, nonenergy) rose 4-1/4 percent in 1988, double the
1987 pace. The acceleration was widespread among consumer goods, and also
was evident in several types of capital equipment.
In addition to higher labor costs, an acceleration in price increases
for intermediate materials (less food and energy) probably has contributed
to the pickup in prices of finished goods. Prices of intermediate materials
and components had accelerated from about mid-1986 through late 1987, and
increases in these prices have been running around 7 percent at an annual
rate over the past five quarters. The increases last year were largest for
products of the metals, chemicals, and paper industries, which have operated
at high levels of capacity utilization.
The increase in the PPI for crude nonfood materials less energy in
1988, of 6 percent, was much less than the 23 percent climb of 1987.
However, the rise in crude materials prices remained above the rate of
finished goods inflation. More recently, prices have firmed in a number of

APPENDIX
FEDERAL BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR 1990 AND THE LONGER-RUN BUDGET OUTLOOK
President Reagan's FY1990 Budget was submitted to the Congress on
January 9, as required by law. President Bush is expected to indicate his
own budget priorities in an address on February 9. Alternative
projections that may be used by the Congress as the base for its
deliberations are contained in CBO's January 24 report on the economic and
budget outlook. Hearings are now under way and the congressional target is
a budget resolution by mid-April.
The Reagan budget proposes to reduce the federal deficit to $93 billion
in FY90 and to achieve a surplus by FY94 (line 3 of table 1). Even without
enactment of the Reagan program, the OMB projects that the deficit would
decline over the next five years, from $127 billion in FY90 to near balance
by FY94 (line 1 of the table). This "current services" estimate assumes
that budget authority is held constant in real terms for all discretionary
programs including defense, that programs for entitlements and other
mandatory spending continue to operate as specified in current laws, and
that the tax law is unchanged. In contrast, CBO projects that the deficit
in FY90 will be $141 billion under current spending and tax policies (line
4) and would decrease merely to $122 billion by 1994.

II-A-2
CBO's baseline estimates differ from the administration's current
services figures mainly because their economic assumptions are more
pessimistic. Aggregate receipts in the two sets of budget projections,
shown in table 2, are quite close, as the higher inflation in CBO's economic
outlook roughly offsets the effects of their slower assumed growth of real
income.2 On the spending side of the budget, however, the
administration's more optimistic projections of inflation and nominal3interest rates lower their projections of outlays. Differences in
technical assumptions, such as those for FSLIC spending, also affect the
budget figures.
Both OMB and CBO raised their estimates of the deficit from levels
forecast last summer. The administration's projections contain slightly
higher estimates of receipts for both FY89 and FY90 than in the August
Mid-Session Review but substantially higher outlays (almost $28 billion for
FY89 and $16 billion for FY90). The continued surge in deposit insurance
outlays and higher interest costs account for close to two-thirds of the
rise in 1989 outlays; the upward revisions in OMB's estimates of outlays for
1990 are considerably more widespread, though the increase of $10 billion in
interest outlays looms large. CBO's deficit projections were revised up by
lesser amounts--$7 billion in FY89 and $5 billion in FY90. In CBO's
estimates, upward revisions of outlays, largely for interest and deposit
insurance, outweighed the increase since last July in their estimates for
receipts.
The focus of the Reagan budget initiatives remains essentially the same
as it has for the last several years (see table 3). The budget does not
call for any major changes in tax law. In the near term, the projected
growth of receipts averages 8 percent over FY89 and FY90, mainly reflecting
the assumed expansion of nominal income and employment. However, current
law also provides a boost in payroll taxes in January 1990, when the
combined employer-employee Social Security tax rate rises 0.27 percentage
point.
On the outlay side, relatively small increases in spending--totaling
$5.1 billion in FY90--are slated for defense, international affairs,
science, and a few other programs deemed to have a high priority. Outlay
reductions--in almost all cases requests similar to those in earlier Reagan
budgets--are proposed for some entitlements (Medicare, Medicaid, civil
2. Particularly in the near term, CBO appears to be slightly more
optimistic than the Treasury about the volume of receipts associated with a
given amount of income (particularly personal income).
3. The administration's economic assumptions are indicated as being
premised broadly on the policies put forth in the budget, including the
contour of deficit reduction. Thus, they might argue that failure to
achieve the roughly $40 billion deficit reduction in their proposals for the
1992-1994 period would imply higher interest rates than in their
projections.
4. Unlike past years, there appear to be few definitional differences
between the administration's current services and CBO baseline concepts, and
they are relatively insignificant.

service pensions, and agricultural support payments); reduction or outright
elimination is again requested for a variety of domestic discretionary
programs. With the suggested policy changes, growth of total outlays in the
next two years is expected to average 4 percent. This is a little faster
than the assumed rate of inflation for the economy as a whole, but, apart
from defense, interest, and Social Security, outlay growth would fall well
below that inflation rate. President Bush is expected to propose some
changes in priorities from those in the Reagan budget, but the overall
magnitude of deficit reduction proposals is likely to be similar.
The proposals in the Reagan budget for FY90 meet the requirement under
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings that the deficit decline to at least $100 billion,
even after excluding roughly $6 billion of asset sales proposed in the
budget but disallowed in the deficit calculation for G-R-H purposes. The
OMB has estimated the FY90 deficit at $126 billion under current laws, when
calculated as required by Gramm-Rudman. Thus, a minimum of $16 billion in
deficit-reducing actions by October 20 is indicated in order to avoid a
sequestration of $26 billion. The first OMB sequestration report, to be
issued in August, will reflect an updated economic forecast, newly emerging
spending trends, and legislation enacted by August 15. (OMB's sequester
reports are the only ones relevant to the occurrence and amount of
sequester.)
Coupled with the ebbing of real defense purchases already in train from
past cuts in appropriations, the deficit-reducing initiatives in the final
Reagan budget--if fully enacted--would amount to a fairly restrictive fiscal
policy for 1990. As measured by the Board staff's new fiscal indicator, the
absolute value of the restraint would be only slightly smaller than the
absolute value of the stimulus in 1982 and 1983, when the ERTA tax cuts
first went into effect.
The remainder of this appendix provides perspective on five key areas
of the budget, each of which is likely to be a focal point of the upcoming
debates on fiscal policy.
Revenues
The numerous tax laws enacted over the Reagan years have had a
substantial effect on the level and structure of receipts. The sum of tax
law changes since 1981 is estimated by the Treasury to reduce total receipts
by $171 billion in FY89 and by $195 billion in FY90 (see table 4). The
Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 had the largest effect, lowering the level
of revenues by an estimated $323 billion in FY90; other tax law changes have
generally increased receipts. The composition of total receipts also
has been changed: nearly all the reduction since 1981 has fallen on
individual income taxes, estimated to have been lowered by a total of $200
to $300 billion per year over the 1988-92 horizon; corporate taxes have been
increased $25 billion to $45 billion over the horizon, and social insurance
taxes have been increased about $28 billion.
5. Effects of tax law changes were calculated at currently projected
income levels.

The number and magnitude of the changes in tax law have, of course,
complicated forecasts of future revenues. The effect of the Tax Reform Act
of 1986 has been especially difficult to estimate, and according to figures
provided in the administration's budget document, the act now is not
expected to be revenue neutral. Treasury currently estimates that tax
reform reduced revenues by roughly $9 billion last year, and they expect the
reforms to lower revenues by $24 billion in FY89 and by $20 billion in FY90
from what they would have been under previous law. These estimates of
revenue loss are about $5 billion larger in FY88, and $7 billion larger in
FY89 and FY90, than previous administration projections; and they are
considerably more than CBO estimates. Furthermore, a permanent revenue loss
in the neighborhood of $20 billion per year is projected into the future by
the Treasury but not by CBO. The Treasury attributes a greater revenue loss
to personal income tax receipts, as it finds the effects of lower rates
outweighing the revenue gains from the base-broadening on personal taxes
by a wider margin than CBO. (Among the major base-broadening changes were
limitations of consumer interest deductions, tax deferral opportunities, and
passive investment losses.) CBO has not done a new study of the revenue
effects of the 1986 act in isolation from other developments involving
receipts, as it is still too early for data to be available from audited tax
returns filed after the act became effective. Even with such data, the
precise effects of such complex and extensive legislation would be difficult
to measure.
The Reagan budget proposes about a dozen relatively small further
changes to the tax code, with the net effect of reducing the deficit by $1
billion in FY90 and by about $3 billion annually in subsequent years. The
largest change would extend the Medicare payroll tax to all state and local
workers hired before 1986. A portion of such workers do not pay the
Medicare tax, yet they frequently qualify for Medicare benefits at age 65
because their spouse is covered or because they have short periods of
employment when they did pay the tax. Extending the payroll tax coverage
would raise about $2 billion annually beginning in FY90. This proposal has
been considered and rejected by the Congress recently.
Other general revenue proposals include allowances for an FY90 loss of
$2.1 billion in receipts related to business R&D activities, an FY90 gain of
$0.9 billion in receipts from extending aviation-related taxes, and minor
gains from other fees. In addition to these proposals for new or increased
fees that show on the receipts side of the ledger, proposals also are made
regarding a number of user fees and other income categorized as "offsetting
receipts." These proposals reduce the outlay side of the budget by a total
of $1 billion in FY90 and represent an effort to recover costs of activities
more directly, resulting in greater efficiency than general revenue funding.
Similar efficiency arguments apply to income from two regulatory proposals:
sale of chlorofluorocarbon production rights ($400 million in FY90) and sale
of licenses for use of some broadcast frequencies ($2.2 billion in FY90).
Defense Outlays
Compared with other Reagan budgets, the FY90 version requests a rather
small increase in the military budget. Relative to the current services

estimate that holds defense constant in real terms, the administration has
requested 2 percent growth in spending authority. In FY90, this is
estimated to result in an increase in outlays of only about $2 billion.
However, because the requested increase in spending is for continued
modernization of strategic and conventional forces and involves procurement
of new equipment, the rise in outlays is much greater in subsequent years;
maintaining 2 percent real growth in appropriations is estimated to raise
outlays by $15 billion in FY94, relative to the zero real growth baseline.
In recent years the Congress has not fully funded the Reagan military
budget requests. In FY86 and again in FY87 the nominal levels of defense
appropriations were actually cut from the previous year; for FY88 and FY89,
defense appropriations were held to zero real growth as part of the
late-1987 budget summit agreement. These reductions from previous requests
have scaled back force structure from that envisioned in earlier years of
the Reagan administration and have slowed spending for a number of defense
projects, such as the Strategic Defense Initiative. (Nonetheless, SDI
funding has grown, and for FY90 the administration is requesting $6 billion
for SDI research and construction, nearly $2 billion more than appropriated
for the current year.) The current defense budget request anticipates
little change in the present configuration of defense forces and anticipates
some postponements in outlays for maintenance.
The changes in defense spending resulting from lower appropriations
have had a direct effect on the growth of GNP. Defense outlays increased
through 1987 in real terms, reflecting the large backlog of appropriations
and deliveries of equipment. In 1988, however, nominal growth of military
outlays slowed considerably; in real terms, defense purchases fell 3.2
percent from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of last year
on a national income accounts basis. Based on appropriations through FY89,
real military spending is expected decline further this year. Since these
purchases are measured largely on a delivery basis, much of the production
and employment effect is already occurring.
Deposit Insurance
Actions to deal with deposit insurance obligations at troubled
depository institutions is expected to have significant budgetary effects.
Expenditures associated with assisted mergers of some large banks have
swelled FDIC net outlays recently but, of course, aid to thrifts is greater
by far. Before 1986, net outlays by FSLIC were about zero, as premiums
roughly offset agency spending. However, net outlays rose to $1.2 billion
in FY86, $4.3 billion in FY87, and $8.1 billion last year. (The recent
outlay figures are net of both FICO funds and premium income.) Not all of
the gross outlays reflected in these figures represent actual cash;
promissory notes are also recorded as outlays. However, assistance
agreements that guarantee the interest income and book value of
nonperforming assets create a contingent liability for which outlays are
recorded only when payments are actually made. Thus, the amount of
immediately recorded outlays does not correspond to the total costs reported
in the press for closing or merging various institutions, nor do the budget
costs recorded so far represent the total costs likely to emerge over time.

II-A-9
In the budget, the administration assumed that net spending by FSLIC in
FY89 will match that of FY88--about $8 billion. For FY90, the
administration has assumed a drop in FSLIC net outlays to $2 billion as
offsetting receipts are projected to surge; larger net figures are projected
for subsequent years. Given the widely discussed range of estimates for
funds needed to meet the thrift industry problems, any budget estimates for
FSLIC are somewhat arbitrary pending legislative clarification.
Health Care
Many of the budget cuts in recent years have been directed at stemming
the growth of outlays for health care. As shown on table 5, federal
spending on health encompasses a wide range of programs, with direct
payments to providers through Medicare and Medicaid accounting for the
largest portion of expenditures. Overall, nearly 14 percent of the federal
budget, or $146 billion, was devoted to health care in one form or another
last year. Moreover, despite efforts to cut spending, health remains the
fastest growing area of outlays.
Despite pressures for overall budget stringency, a major expansion of
the Medicare program was enacted last year--the Medicare Catastrophic
Coverage Act of 1988. But the expanded coverage clearly reflected a
different budget philosophy than the one used a quarter century earlier when
Medicare was initiated. The additional coverage provided under Medicare,
which begins this year and phases-in provisions over the next several years,
is purported to be deficit neutral. Virtually all of the added expenses are
borne by the recipient population through insurance premiums; furthermore, a
major feature of the new premium structure is that part of an individual's
additional premium is a function of the annual income of the enrollee,
reducing the expected value of Medicare for higher-income recipients.
In the Reagan budget for FY90, one-fourth of the proposed cuts in
outlays from current-services levels is derived from health programs; the
total cut from all health care programs is expected to be $8 billion in FY90
and $21 billion by FY94. The budget proposes to curb Medicare costs by
further limiting increases in payments for some physician services and
reducing payments for medical equipment and hospital outpatient care.
Enrollees' premiums for the Supplementary Medical Insurance portion of
Medicare would be set to yield 25 percent of estimated costs, resulting in
an increase in receipts relative to current law. In addition, the
administration wishes to cut grants to states for Medicaid. Current law
provides that the states administer Medicaid under broad federal guidelines;
6. Under current law, these premiums are required to change each January
by the lesser of the cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits
or the amount needed to pay for 50 percent of program costs. However, in
recent years, the Congress has held the amount of costs to be covered by
premiums to 25 percent. Eliminating the option of raising premiums only by
the rate of the Social Security COLA would reduce net federal costs relative
to current services because the rate of increase in Medicare costs is likely
to remain substantially more than the anticipated COLAs.

the cost of the program is shared, with the federal government paying from
50 percent to 80 percent of total outlays.
Agriculture
Another major determinant of the recent growth in spending has been
changes in federal farm payments: Spending under the agriculture function
in the budget, which includes all the Commodity Credit Corporation support
programs as well as other federal activities in the farm sector, has had no
discernible trend in recent years (see chart). In FY87 and FY88, declining
expenditures helped to hold down the deficit; the particularly sharp drop in
FY88 was due in part to the effects of the drought, which raised market
prices of crops and thereby reduced subsidy payments.
The administration estimates that some increase in agriculture outlays
is likely in the current year, owing in part to drought relief payments to
farmers. For FY90 and subsequent years, the administration projects
reductions in agriculture spending. Included in these estimates is a
proposal to cut farm income stabilization programs by about $3 billion
annually from current services levels, either through reducing target prices
on crops or through eliminating some acreage eligible for deficiency
payments. In any case, the volatility of federal agricultural payments
contributes considerable uncertainty to the estimates of federal spending in
the near term. Adding to that uncertainty is the likelihood that
agriculture policy will be a major congressional issue during the current
session, as provisions enacted in the huge 1985 farm bill expire in 1990.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The federal funds rate has risen about 1/2 percentage point since the
last FOMC meeting in response to tightening bank reserve positions.
However, the markets evidently had been anticipating some firming, and with
year-end pressures abating, most private short-term rates are unchanged or
down somewhat on balance. Bond yields, too, have moved lower, on net,
reflecting in part the strengthening private demand for dollar assets that
has driven the U.S. currency upward on exchange markets of late. The dollar
and bond prices both responded positively to indications that the Federal
Reserve continued to place a high priority on restraining inflation. Equity
investors apparently were encouraged by these developments, and share prices
have posted hefty advances.
Growth of M2 and M3 slowed to the 1 to 3 percent range in January, as a
result of a sizable decline in transactions deposits and a net weakening in
growth of other deposits as well. The opportunity cost of holding deposits
has generally risen over the last two months. Ml contracted in January at
about a 4 percent annual rate.
Private credit demands in the aggregate appear still to be growing
faster than nominal GNP. Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses is estimated
to have picked up recently, with rapid growth in commercial paper and bank
loans offsetting a cutback in issuance of securities. All indications are
that an active housing market has continued to generate substantial growth
in home mortgage debt, while consumer borrowing seems to be sticking to a
path of fairly moderate expansion. Municipal bond issuance has
strengthened, buoyed by the drop in rates. Federal borrowing, in contrast,
III-1

III-2
is dropping in the current quarter, owing to a smaller deficit and the
availability of large year-end Treasury cash balances.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit1
Growth of the monetary aggregates is estimated to have slowed in
January, owing largely to a sharp drop in transactions deposits induced at
least in part by the rising opportunity cost of holding such deposits.
Although currency growth remained robust, demand deposits declined at a
15 percent annual rate, and OCDs, which had been relatively strong in
November and December, also declined. As a result, M1 contracted at a
4 percent annual rate in January and M2 growth sagged to a 1 percent annual
rate. Growth in M3 dropped to a 3 percent rate, despite some pickup in its
non-M2 components.
A runoff in savings deposits and MMDAs accelerated in January at both
banks and thrifts, curtailing growth in the nontransactions component of M2.
Funds apparently have been diverted from these deposits--whose rates have
been flat in recent months--to market instruments, as suggested by the large
amount of noncompetitive tenders at recent Treasury auctions. Some shift
also has been occurring within M2, as small time deposits continued the
pattern of strong growth established in the fourth quarter. Rates on small
time deposits also have lagged market rates, but to a much lesser degree
than rates on the more liquid deposits. As has been the case since the
second quarter of last year, growth in savings and small time deposits
has been much weaker at thrifts than at commercial banks; indeed thrifts
experienced outflows of such deposits in December and January, likely

and seasonal factor revisions, which will be reported in the Bluebook.
Those revisions, however, do not materially alter the picture.

reflecting less aggressive pricing at those institutions as well as recent
adverse publicity.
The non-M2 component of M3 picked up to an 8 percent annual rate in
January, largely reflecting a rebound in term RPs and strength in
institution-only MMMFs. Returns on the latter increased relative to market
rates in early January. With limited funding needed to cover moderate asset
growth, commercial banks issued fewer large time deposits than in December,
despite the smaller inflows of core deposits and an estimated $8 billion
decline in Treasury balances at banks. At thrifts, however, large time
deposit issuance edged up and, overall, the large time deposit component of
M3 remained on a growth path of about 6 percent in January.
Bank credit is estimated to have resumed expanding in January, although
to only a 4 percent annual rate, owing to considerably stronger loan growth.
Securities holdings declined as municipal securities continued to run off
rapidly. The upturn in loan growth reflected a sharp acceleration in
business loans to an 18 percent annual rate; this pickup was due to double-
digit growth of loans at large U.S. banks and continued acceleration in
loans booked by foreign-related institutions. The strength of business
loans at large banks was associated in part with a sharp decline in loans
booked at foreign branches of U.S. banks, as market rates have risen
relative to the prime rate. About 4 percentage points of January's business
loan growth was estimated to be merger-related. Real estate loans bounced
back from a slow December pace, and consumer loans continued to exhibit some
strength even as securitization of consumer loans picked up.

Business Finance
Total borrowing by nonfinancial businesses has picked up over the past
two months, as a large increase in short-term borrowing has more than offset
lower bond issuance. Commercial paper recorded another sharp increase in
January after December's bulge, and the total of bank loans to business and
nonfinancial commercial paper advanced at a 14 percent annual rate in
December and 20 percent in January. Nevertheless, borrowing seems
relatively low in light of apparently large credit needs of the business
sector. Net equity retirements are estimated to have reached a record
annual rate of $195 billion in the fourth quarter of 1988 and are projected
at near that rate in the first quarter of 1989, buoyed by the RJR-Nabisco
deal. At the same time, the underlying gap between capital outlays and
internal funds remains quite wide.
Several factors have contributed to the recent growth of nonfinancial
commercial paper, which has amounted to more than $11 billion over the past
two months. First, issuance of investment-grade industrial bonds diminished
sharply after the RJR-Nabisco LBO was announced, and holders of RJR bonds
experienced sizable losses. The enlarged shorter-term credit demands of
investment-grade firms has focused on the commercial paper market, where
such firms generally can obtain funds most cheaply. Second, in December,
commercial paper may have been an especially attractive source of funds
compared to bank loans priced off Eurodollar rates, because the spread
between the one-month LIBOR and the one-month commercial paper rate widened
substantially.
Since the last FOMC meeting, only four firms have issued investment-
grade bonds, with one of these issues carrying a "poison put" covenant that

allows the bondholders to sell their bonds back to the firm at par in the
event of a major restructuring. New offerings of junk bonds also have
been moderate, but heavy issuance seems likely to resume as soon as
investment banks seek to arrange takeouts of the bridge loans they recently
have extended to facilitate mergers and LBOs.2 For example, RJR is slated
to issue more than $7 billion in junk bonds over the next few months.
Most stock price indexes have advanced 8 to 10 percent since mid-
December and now are above their levels on October 16, 1987, the Friday
before the crash. Because corporate profits have climbed since that time,
price-earnings ratios are well below pre-crash levels. For example, the P-E
ratio for the Standard and Poor's 500 was just over 12 at the end of
January, compared with about 21 in the week before the crash. With P-E
ratios lower, few nonfinancial firms have been issuing equity. The surge in
nonfinancial issuance in January largely reflects $2 billion in shares
swapped in a merger between two utilities, rather than a broad rebound.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff forecast for the first-quarter federal budget deficit is
$62 billion, not seasonally adjusted, about $5-1/2 billion less than the
deficit posted last quarter. In anticipation of the seasonal tax inflow
during the second quarter, the Treasury is expected to cover $25 billion of
the first-quarter deficit out of its cash balance. Marketable borrowing is
expected to fall $8 billion from fourth-quarter levels, with the reduction
2. On December 21, 1988, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., agreed to plead
guilty to felony charges related to securities law violations and to pay
$650 million in fines and civil restitution. The news had little immediate
effect on the junk bond market. However, Drexel has not underwritten any
new issues since December 22, which contrasts with their average of
6-1/2 issues a month in 1988.

to be concentrated in the weekly bill sector. Nonmarketable borrowing is
expected to decrease about $4 billion, owing largely to a slowdown in SLGS
issuance. In addition, "other borrowing" is likely to decline appreciably
as the pace of FSLIC note offerings slackens.
In the first quarter, net cash raised through coupon securities is
expected to increase somewhat from fourth-quarter levels, and gross auction
sizes should be a bit larger in a few cases. During the second half of
1988, the increase in stripping activity reportedly augmented the demand for
long-term bonds, and may have contributed to the inversion of the long end
of the Treasury yield curve. The heavy stripping activity was fueled
primarily by demand from pension funds adjusting to changes in accounting
rules prior to year-end.4
Borrowing by the federally sponsored credit agencies was robust in the
fourth quarter, totaling $12.5 billion. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs)
alone borrowed $9 billion, largely to finance advances to member
institutions, which have relied heavily upon this source of funds in view
of their weak deposit growth. Despite the FHLBs' large borrowing in recent
months and more adverse publicity about the thrift industry, yields on FHLB
issues have declined somewhat relative to yields on Treasury securities
since early fall, a development that reportedly owes to the absence of heavy
bond issuance by most other agencies and by corporations.
3. About $12 billion less in new cash is expected to be raised than in the
fourth-quarter bill auctions; the gross size of the auctions likely will
increase slightly because a larger volume of bills is maturing.
4. FASB 87 includes new rules affecting the rate at which pension funds
can discount deferred liabilities, allowing more favorable discount factors
for plans that match their liabilities with similar duration assets.
Because the duration of the long-maturity payments of stripped bonds is
similar to pension fund liabilities, the rule change caused funds' demand
for strips to soar.

III-11
Reflecting the large volume of savings and loan resolutions by the
FSLIC, the Financing Corporation raised $2.1 billion during the fourth
quarter. The FSLIC consolidated 75 thrift institutions in December, raising
total mergers and liquidations to 225 for all of 1988. The combined assets
of the thrifts resolved in December totaled $70 billion, almost twice the
assets of thrifts resolved during the previous 11 months. Nearly half of
the December FSLIC-assisted agreements were completed in a flurry of
activity in the final five days of the year as acquirers captured tax
advantages that will be significantly reduced in 1989.5
Municipal Securities
Gross new issues of long-term tax-exempt securities totaled a brisk
$10-3/4 billion in December, and available data point to strength in this
sector in January. December's volume stemmed from a substantial increase in
issuance for new capital, especially transportation, education, and hospital
bonds. For all of 1988, according to the most recent data from Public
Securities Association (PSA), municipal volume totaled about $110 billion,
about half the volume of the tax-related surge in 1985, but approximately
even with the 1987 total. The PSA forecasts that municipal tax-exempt
volume will climb to about $120 billion during 1989, owing primarily to
increased demand for new capital to finance investment in solid-waste
disposal, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure needs.
5. The principal tax benefits available to acquirers of thrifts are the
ability to carry forward losses and the exemption of FSLIC assistance
payments from federal taxation. The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act
of 1988 reduced the amount of losses that can be carried forward by 50
percent of the amount of tax-free FSLIC assistance payments, effective in
1989.

III-12
The 40 basis point decline in yields on long-term municipal securities
over the intermeeting period has reduced the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable
yields to its lowest level in five years. This sharp decline has occurred
despite possible future downgradings of bonds issued by New York State,
Connecticut, and New Jersey, each of which has suffered a significant
revenue shortfall.

Mortgage Markets
Contract interest rates on commitments for conventional fixed-rate home
loans and for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) declined a bit most recently,
but are a little higher than in the week preceding the last FOMC meeting.
Lenders have continued to offer sizable initial rate discounts on ARMs, in
order to gain or retain market share and loan-origination fees. The FHLBB's
December survey of conventional home mortgage loans closed show that an
estimated 60 percent of ARMs closed in the first five working days of the
month carried initial discounts, with an average discount in excess of 200

basis points. To compensate for the reduced interest revenues associated
with initially discounted rates, many lenders have increased the number of
points charged and also the normal markup over the index rate applicable
after the discount period, which is now as high as 3 percentage points for
some newly originated loans.
Another perspective on ARM discounting is provided by historical
comparisons between average initial ARM rates and two common ARM indexes.
The degree of ARM discounting appears particularly large when ARM rates are
compared with rates on one-year Treasuries. Over the course of last year,
average initial ARM rates dropped from 90 basis points above to 60 basis
points below the one-year Treasury rate. However, when ARM rates are
matched against the FHLB System's 11th District Cost-of-Funds Index, ARM
discounting appears to have stabilized since the middle part of last year.
Both originations and new commitments to originate mortgages increased
at FSLIC-insured institutions in November, after declining in each of the
two preceding months. These institutions acquired $4.3 billion of mortgage-
related assets in November, despite a sharp slowing in growth of holdings of
whole mortgage loans. The strong pickup in thrift net investment in
mortgage-backed securities likely reflects a desire by thrifts to carry some
of their ARM loans in securitized form, possibly to enhance their value as
collateral for borrowings.
The increased demand for securitized ARMs is reflected in the pattern
of issuance of federally related mortgage-backed pass-through securities.
While offerings of fixed-rate pass-throughs have been flat to declining in
recent months, agency issuance of ARM-backed securities has picked up. A
sizable proportion of the agency ARM pass-throughs are backed by loans

November, paced again by strong growth in revolving credit. Preliminary
data from holders accounting for about two-thirds of the total suggest that
installment credit growth remained around that rate again in December.
Suppliers of consumer credit have been raising larger amounts of funds
through issuance of securities backed by consumer loans. From their
inception in May 1985 through year-end 1988, $35 billion of these asset-
backed securities has been publicly marketed. At the end of 1988,
approximately $23 billion remained outstanding, including most of the
credit-card-related volume and about half of the auto-backed volume. There
have been a number of private placements as well, but data are virtually
nonexistent; estimates for this segment range from $4 billion to $8 billion
of offerings. Market participants reportedly anticipate further strong
growth of consumer credit securitization well into 1990, spurred in large
part by risk-based capital requirements.6 Citibank has already gotten
this year off to a strong start by offering a $1 billion credit-card-backed
issue in late January.
6. Consumer loans at commercial banks will be in the 100 percent risk
category; the process of securitization--sale, without recourse, of a loan
pool to a third party that issues the securities--results in removal of the
loans from the balance sheet. Thus, the capital requirement is eliminated
while, in almost all instances, the bank retains income from both the
origination and servicing fees on the loan pool.

The market has evolved from one dominated by auto-backed issues in 1986
and 1987--especially those of GMAC and Chrysler--to one featuring credit
card issues in 1988. In part, this evolution resulted from overcoming the
difficulty in structuring and pricing credit-card-backed securities as well
as reduced activity by the major auto finance companies in 1988. Other
significant developments in 1988 were the first sales of securities backed
by boat loans, rapid expansion of manufactured-housing-backed securities,
and the entry of Citibank, Sears, Wards, Penney's, and Spiegel into the
credit card securities market. Continual broadening of the techniques used
in asset-backed securitizations to include, for instance, use of a senior
subordinated debt structure for some issues reflects efforts to reach a
wider range of investors--some of whom may face legal constraints on the
types of securities they may hold.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. Merchandise Trade
In November the seasonally adjusted U.S. merchandise trade deficit
was $11 billion (Census basis, Customs valuation), compared with an $8.8
billion (revised) deficit in October. The deficit widened as imports
rose sharply and exports fell slightly. Valued on a CIF basis the
November deficit was $12.5 billion, while the revised deficit for
October was $10.3 billion.

Among the categories of imports showing the largest increases from
October to November were consumer goods and capital goods. The small
decline in exports was spread across various trade categories.
IV-1

IV-2
For October and November combined, the merchandise trade deficit is
estimated to have been $123 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
(balance-of-payments basis), slightly larger than the $116 billion
third-quarter rate. While the value of exports increased at an annual
rate of 1.2 percent, the value of imports increased at a rate of 7.4
percent (see table on next page).
In constant 1982 dollars, exports fell slightly from the third
quarter to October/November, due to a decline in agricultural exports
(mostly the result of a slowing in shipments of corn to the Soviet Union
and wheat to China). In October/November the volume of nonagricultural
exports rose at an annual rate of 4 percent. The volume of non-oil
imports increased by 3.2 percent at an annual rate in October/November,
and the increases were widespread across trade categories. The largest
increase was in passenger cars from Japan and Germany, which rose from
somewhat depressed levels in the third quarter. Other increases were in
industrial supplies and consumer goods.
Staff estimates suggest that the value of nonagricultural exports
increased to all areas of the world in October/November, with the
exception of Japan and the Asian newly industrialized economies. The
decline in agricultural exports affected every region of the world,
except Western Europe. Non-oil imports from industrial countries
increased sharply (particularly: Canada 11 percent, Japan 8 percent,
and Western Europe 6 percent). Non-oil imports from Taiwan and Korea
both dropped by more than 12 percent.

The volume of oil imports was essentially flat in October and
November from the third-quarter rate, while oil prices fell sharply.
Since the OPEC accord in mid-November, spot prices have risen
significantly, returning to levels recorded in the first half of 1988.

Import and Export Prices
Prices of non-oil imports (n.s.a.) rose on average 10 percent at an
annual rate in the fourth quarter, according to data released by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. This was the same rate of increase as
prevailed in the first two quarters of the year and follows a price
decline on average in the third quarter. For the four quarters of 1988
as a whole, the increase in non-oil import prices was 6.9 percent.
All the major categories of imports shown in the table on the next
page posted higher rates of price increase in the fourth quarter than in
the third. An important influence on these price movements was the
exchange value of the dollar which, after appreciating during the third
quarter, declined during the fourth quarter.
Prices of exports on average declined at an annual rate of 0.8
percent in the fourth quarter, led by a 21.3 percent decline in the
price of foods, feeds, and beverages and a 3.6 percent drop in the price

of computers, peripherals, and parts. However, with the exception of
industrial supplies, prices of other exports rose at a faster pace in
the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Despite the large
fourth-quarter decline, the index for prices of exports of foods, feeds,
and beverages closed the year 21.4 percent higher than a year ago, due
in part to the summer drought. Prices for industrial supplies, capital
goods (excluding computers), and consumer goods all showed increases
throughout each quarter of the year. For the year, prices of exports
rose 6.3 percent on average (Q4/Q4).
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Net private purchases of Treasury securities by foreigners rose to
$8 billion in November (see line 3 on the Summary Table of U.S.
International Transactions), as the spread between U.S. and foreign
interest rates widened considerably during that month. Over half of the
net purchases in November were made by Japanese residents; of these
purchases an unusually large share was concentrated in bills, reflecting
the particularly large increase in the spread between U.S. and Japanese
short-term interest rates.
Net private purchases of corporate bonds by foreigners also picked
up in October and remained strong in November (line 2a). The rate of
Eurobond issuances by U.S. corporations in the two months was about
equal to that in the first three quarters of 1988 ($2 billion per
month), but the share of newly issued bonds denominated in foreign
currencies rose to one half from an average of one third in the first
three quarters. Activity in the Eurobond market slowed markedly in

December and U.S. corporate issuance fell to $50 million. In January
the Eurobond market picked up, but new U.S. corporate issues remained
well below the pace of 1988. Market commentary attributes the lack of
new U.S. issues to investor concern about the risk associated with
corporate restructurings, and only the most highly rated U.S.
corporations find the Euromarket attractive. Demand for U.S. dollar-
denominated bonds was strong in January, but favorable swap
opportunities allowed issuers to convert debt denominated in high
yielding currencies, such as Canadian and Australian dollars, into U.S.
dollar obligations paying significantly less than comparable U.S. dollar
bonds. As a result, the proportion of foreign-currency denominated
bonds issued by U.S. corporations remained relatively high. Foreign
private net purchases of U.S. corporate stock were again negligible in
October and November.
Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities (line 2c), which had
averaged less than $3/4 billion per month from June through September,
rose to over $3-1/2 billion in October, at a time when interest rate
differentials were stable and the dollar came under downward pressure.
U.S. residents made $1/4 billion net sales of foreign securities in
November, as U.S. interest rates rose relative to foreign rates.
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States rose $6

the United States rose by $1-1/4 billion in November, marking the first
significant increase since the first quarter of 1986. Preliminary data
for December, based on holdings at FRBNY, indicate continued accumula-
tions by Taiwan and OPEC countries.
U.S. banks increased their net claims on own foreign offices by
$1 billion in December (line 1 on the International Banking Table),
reversing the net inflow reported earlier in the fourth quarter. Rapid
increases in small time deposits, and slow growth in business loan
demand, permitted banks to rely less on non-deposit funds in general and
Eurodollar borrowing in particular.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted, foreign-exchange value of the dollar rose about
6-1/4 percent since the last FOMC meeting on December 14, nearly
reversing its decline in October and November. The dollar appreciated
about the same amount against the yen; against the mark, the dollar rose
8 percent. The dollar strengthened despite the release of U.S. trade
data for October and November showing larger-than-expected deficits, two
rounds of European interest-rate increases,
Market commentary, focusing on the
continuing upward movement of the federal funds rate, attributed the
dollar's strength to an actual and prospective tightening of monetary
policy in the United States. Expectations that interest rates in the
United States would remain firm were reinforced late in the period by
remarks from Chairman Greenspan indicating that current levels of
inflation were too high.

IV-11
Changes in interest-rate differentials, however, show a mixed
picture of support for the dollar. Short-term dollar-yen interest-rate
differentials did move in favor of dollar-denominated assets during the
intermeeting period. While the federal funds rate rose nearly 60 basis
points from mid-December to about 9-1/8 percent, the call money rate in
Japan fell almost 30 basis points to just below 4 percent. At the
three-month maturity, the U.S. Treasury bill rate firmed nearly 30 basis
points to 8.69 percent on a yield basis, while the gensaki rate rose
less than 10 basis points to about 4.25 percent.1 In contrast,
interest rates on mark-denominated assets appear to have moved with
those on dollar assets, leaving short-term differentials little changed
(and the mark inexplicably weak). The call money rate in Germany, after
some year-end volatility, is expected to settle about 75 basis points
higher than its mid-December level of 5 percent, the three-month
interbank rate in Germany rose about 50 basis points to around 6
percent.
Long-term interest-rate differentials narrowed during the
intermeeting period. While the nominal yield on long-term U.S. Treasury
securities declined, the average of long-term bond yields in Germany
rose nearly 30 basis points to 6.66 percent and the yield on the
bellwether bond in Japan rose slightly more to 4.82 percent.
1. The 90-day CD rate, usually used by the staff to indicate short-
term rates in U.S. money markets, is not used in this comparison since
it and other private rates appeared to be more affected by seasonal
pressures around year end.

As shown in the table below, the Bundesbank raised the Lombard
rate a total of 1 percentage point since December 14 in two steps to
6 percent and the discount rate 1/2 percentage point to 4 percent.

These actions were taken to dampen money-supply growth and to work
against a tendency toward rising domestic prices and a further decline
in the mark. Official interest rates in several other European

IV-13
countries were raised a total of 1 percentage point or more, in
conjunction with the increases in Germany.
Desk sales of dollars against marks during the period totaled nearly
$2 billion, with the proceeds split evenly between the Treasury and
System accounts.
U.S. bank lending to foreigners
The dollar value of U.S.-chartered banks' claims on all foreigners
increased about $4.5 billion (1 percent) in the third quarter of 1988.
During this period the foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of
other G-10 currencies rose on average by 2.3 percent. After adjustment
for the effect of exchange rate changes on the value of non-dollar
claims, total claims on foreigners are estimated to have increased by
$7 billion.
The decline in U.S. bank claims on non-OPEC developing countries
continued in the third quarter, with reported claims declining by $4.3
billion, or about 5 percent. Preliminary staff estimates suggest a
decline of a similar amount in the fourth quarter. In the first three
quarters of 1988 U.S. bank claims on non-OPEC developing countries
declined by $10.7 billion, or about 11 percent, compared with an average
annual decline of about $5 billion in the previous three years. In the

third quarter, there were declines in U.S. bank claims on all heavily
indebted countries in Latin America with an especially large decline of
$1.2 billion (5.5 per cent) in U.S. bank claims on Brazil. The decline
in claims on Brazil was spread widely among U.S. banks and resulted from
participation in official and unofficial debt/equity exchanges as well as

IV-15
debt writeoffs. The decline in U.S. bank claims on Asian and African
countries was largely concentrated in claims on Taiwan that were
associated with repayment of dollar loans that were used to speculate on
an appreciation in the New Taiwan Dollar.
U.S. bank claims on most other country groupings changed little in
the third quarter of 1988. U.S. banks hold a relatively small proportion
of total bank claims on Eastern European countries (about 4 percent of
all banks in the BIS reporting area) and to date U.S. banks have shown
limited interest in increasing their exposure to these countries. The
large increase in U.S. bank claims on the miscellaneous category of
foreigners largely represents short-term repurchase transactions with the
World Bank that are associated with its active program of asset and
liability management.
The price of bank claims on heavily indebted countries in the
secondary market declined in the third and fourth quarters of 1988, and
this decline continued in early 1989. (See accompanying table.) The
declines in secondary market prices were widespread among the Baker-15
countries with the exception of Chile. These declines are consistent
with net sales into that market by U.S. and other banks that are revising
their strategies with respect to long-term lending to the developing
countries. Several large Canadian banks are known to have made large net
sales to reduce exposure levels in their accounting year that ended on
October 31, 1988.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
The pace of economic activity abroad showed signs of slowing in the
fourth quarter, following a relatively strong third quarter. In Germany,
provisional fourth-quarter data indicate that real GDP grew at between 0
and 2 percent (s.a.a.r.). In Japan, industrial production slowed slightly
in the fourth quarter; while in the United Kingdom, Canada, and France, a
range of monthly indicators, including industrial production, suggest some
slowing in growth. Only in Italy does growth appear to have maintained its
third-quarter pace.
Signs of a resurgence of inflation in the foreign G-7 countries are
mixed. In Japan, consumer prices rose in January to a level 1.6 percent
above that of a year earlier. In Germany, recent increases in consumer,
wholesale, and import prices in December and January have raised concerns,
although part of the sharp increase in January reflects increased excise
taxes. In the United Kingdom the December retail price index was 6.8
percent above its level a year earlier, with much of the increase due to
the rise in short-term interest rates that has raised the mortgage interest
cost component of the retail price index. In Italy, the January price
level was 5.7 percent above its level a year earlier, although part of the
increase was due to the introduction of a value-added-tax on foods and
newspapers.
Trade and current account imbalances did not improve in the major
foreign industrial countries during the fourth quarter. In Japan and
Germany, trade and current account surpluses increased in November,
although Japan's trade surplus narrowed in December. The United Kingdom

IV-21
registered record trade and current account deficits in the fourth quarter,
although both narrowed somewhat in November and December from the record
levels achieved in October. In Italy and France, trade balances
deteriorated, reflecting, in part, the continued deterioration of these
countries' bilateral trade balances with Germany.
Individual country notes. The pace of real activity in Japan
remained strong in the fourth quarter, but may have slowed somewhat from
the rapid third-quarter pace. Industrial production increased 2.2 percent
in the fourth quarter, compared with a 2.5 percent increase in the third
quarter. The rate of capacity utilization (s.a.) rose sharply in November
by 4 percent. New machinery orders fell slightly in November after a
strong rise in October, but domestic private orders increased in both
months. New housing starts (s.a.) fell 6.4 percent on average in October
and November from the third-quarter level, after rising 6.9 percent in the
third quarter.
Labor market conditions remained tight, with the unemployment rate at
2.4 percent in October and November and the job-offers-to-applicants ratio
rising further. In light of the tight labor market, the major unions plan
to press for a larger share of corporate profits this year during the
coming spring wage round. The two largest unions may ask for a 6 to 8
percent rise in nominal wages, compared with the 4.4 percent increase in
1987/88.
The Tokyo area consumer price index rose sharply in October, as
unusually cold weather pushed up prices of fruits and vegetables, but then
declined in both November and December, leaving the fourth-quarter average

IV-22
1.5 percent above its level a year earlier. In January, this index
increased 1.6 percent from its level a year earlier. The wholesale price
declined 1.1 percent (n.s.a.) in December from its level a year earlier,
and 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter from its level a year earlier.
Japan's trade surplus widened in November but narrowed in December,
bringing its surplus for the year to $77.3 billion, only $2.2 billion less
than in 1987. Exports rose in value by 15.6 percent in 1988 while imports
surged 25.4 percent. Volume estimates show exports increased 5.1 percent
while imports jumped 16.6 percent.
On December 24, the Diet passed the first major reform of the
Japanese tax structure since 1950 that included a controversial
3 percent consumption tax. The number of personal income tax brackets will
be compressed from the present 6 to 5, with the top rate falling from 60 to
50 percent, effective January 1989. The corporate tax rate will be reduced
from 42 to 37.5 percent, phased in over a two-year period starting in April
1989. The 3 percent consumption tax and a 20 percent withholding tax on
capital gains will be introduced in April 1989. After these changes, the
proportion of total tax revenue coming from indirect taxes will be about 33
percent, up from 27 percent currently. This tax package should result in a
net tax reduction of 2.6 trillion yen on a full year basis, and a one-time
increase in consumer prices of about 1 percent.
Economic growth slowed in Germany in the fourth quarter of 1988.
Provisional data suggest that real private consumption showed strength and
that real net exports edged up, but that all other spending categories did
not increase from their third-quarter levels. Part of this apparent easing

IV-23
in growth is due to the effects of abnormal weather, variations in the
number of working days, and new accounting procedures for foreign trade.
Industrial production fell three months in a row through November,
declining 3.1 percent (s.a.) over that period, to a level that was 2.8
percent above its year-earlier level. The November decline has been
attributed to bad weather, and a rebound in December is widely anticipated.
Supporting this view is a rebound in new orders, which rose 1.8 percent
(s.a.) in November, and in real retail sales, which surged 7.8 percent in
November to a level 4.2 percent above that of a year earlier. The
unemployment rate has declined for five consecutive months to a rate of 8.3
percent in December. The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing rose
to 88.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1988, its highest level since
1973, and 3.7 points above its level a year earlier.
The tightening of labor markets and the rise in capacity utilization
have raised concerns about the future course of inflation. Consumer prices
in January increased by 1 percent (n.s.a.) and were 2.5 percent above their
level a year earlier. This increase reflects, in part, the impact of the
increase in consumer excise taxes that took effect January 1. In December,
consumer prices rose 0.2 percent. Wholesale prices also accelerated
sharply, rising 0.8 percent (n.s.a.) in December to a level 3.5 percent
above that of a year earlier. One factor contributing to higher prices has
been the decline in the value of the deutsche-mark, which on balance fell
2.9 percent against the currencies of Germany's major trading partners in
the year ending December 1988, contributing to a 3.9 percent rise in import
prices over that period, and 1.4 percent in December alone.

IV-24
The monthly trade surplus surged to $7.5 billion (n.s.a.) in
November, bringing the cumulative surplus for the year to $65.2 billion, up
$7.2 billion from the same period in 1987. The current account surplus
also rose sharply in November, to $5.9 billion, raising the cumulative
surplus to $42.5 billion, up $2.6 billion from the same period in 1987.
Comparing the first ten months of 1987 and 1988, Germany's trade surplus
with the United States was down 36 percent, to $6.9 billion, while its
surplus with other EEC countries was up 36 percent, to $38.1 billion. Of
concern to German policymakers has been the sharp increase in the private
long-term capital account deficit, which soared from $7.8 billion to $42.2
billion in the first 11 months of 1987 and 1988, respectively.
Growth in M3 was 6.7 percent during 1988 (Q4 over Q4), exceeding the
Bundesbank's target range of 3-to-6 percent, the third successive year of
monetary overshooting. In mid-December, the Bundesbank announced that its
monetary target for 1989 (Q4 over Q4) is for M3 growth of "about 5
percent", which represents a slight tightening in monetary policy.
Government fiscal policy, which was mildly expansionary in 1988, will be
somewhat restrictive in 1989, largely due to increased consumer excise
taxes and the new withholding tax on bond interest, both of which went into
effect January 1.
France recorded a trade deficit of $5.9 billion in 1988, the largest
deficit in five years. Part of this deterioration in the trade balance has
been due to strong growth, particularly in investment, which has caused
imports to surge. The Bank of France announced in December a renewal of
its target range of 4 to 6 percent for M2 for 1989. Data through November

IV-25
indicate that M2 growth in 1988 is very likely to have fallen in the
targeted range.
In the United Kingdom, recent data suggests that the sharp increase
in interest rates implemented by British monetary authorities in the second
half of last year has started to slow the overheated pace of economic
activity. Industrial production rose by 0.1 percent (s.a.) in November
following a 0.5 percent fall in the previous month. The volume of retail
sales was down 0.1 percent (s.a.) in December, the second consecutive
monthly decline. The unemployment rate declined again in December to 7.2
percent (s.a.), the 29th consecutive monthly decline.
In Canada, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce
trade barriers over a five-year period, cleared the Canadian Parliament in
late-December and was implemented on January 1. Studies predict that by
the mid-1990s Canada's GDP will be about 2 percent higher, and the price
level 2.5 percent lower, as a result of the agreement. The first stage of
the Canadian tax reform, passed by Parliament last fall, goes into effect
on April 1 1989. It is intended to be revenue neutral, reducing personal
income tax rates while expanding the tax base. It also cuts the number of
marginal rates to three, the highest of which is now 29 percent. (Hefty
provincial taxes mean that overall tax rates are much higher.) The second
stage, which is before Parliament, is expected to be introduced in 1990.
It contains a national value-added tax and may include a further reduction
in income taxes.

IV-26
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
In December, the Mexican government announced economic policy
guidelines for the first seven months of 1989. Following the inauguration
of President Salinas on December 1, foreign exchange market pressures on
the Mexican peso have eased. On January 16, the Brazilian government
announced the "Summer Plan" aimed at achieving greater price stability.
Episodes of military unrest in Argentina in December and January add to the
climate of uncertainty associated with upcoming presidential elections in
May. In Venezuela, outgoing President Lusinchi announced a three-month
suspension of payments on principal on public debt to commercial banks
effective January 17. At the end of December, Colombia reached an
agreement with commercial banks to provide new money. On February 1,
Peru's government announced major economic policy changes to be implemented
over the next four months.
Individual country notes. In December, the Mexican government
announced economic policy guidelines for the first seven months of 1989.
On January 1, Mexico resumed daily peso devaluations at a rate averaging 1
peso per day, the minimum wage was raised by 8 percent, and many public
sector prices were raised by 30-40 percent. Effective January 11, a 10
percent tariff was imposed on many imports previously entering duty free or
with a duty of 5 percent.
The 1989 public sector budget calls for reducing the overall deficit
to 6.4 percent of GDP from an estimated 10.8 percent in 1988. Interest
payments on domestic debt are expected to fall by 4.5 percent of GDP, but
the estimate is based on an assumed fall in the inflation rate from

IV-27
52 percent in the 12 months ending December 1988 to 18 percent by December
1989. Excluding interest payments, the budget is in surplus, but revenues
are expected to fall more than other expenditures in 1989 because oil
prices are expected to fall.
Following the inauguration of President Salinas on December 1,
foreign exchange market pressures have eased. This has led to a 200 basis
point decline in the 28-day Treasury bill rate from its December high to
50.3 percent at the January 24 auction. Consumer prices rose by 2.1
percent in December and are likely to record a larger rise in January,
following the January 1 price and wage adjustments.
On January 15, Brazilian President Sarney announced the "Summer Plan"
aimed at achieving greater price stability. In addition to some increases
in public sector prices that had already been announced on January 13, the
proposed measures include the following: 1) a 17 percent devaluation; 2)
freezing of prices on 180 items for an indefinite period; 3) elimination of
the wage adjustment formula that adjusted for past increases in inflation;
4) a government commitment not to spend in excess of revenues; and 5) a
reduction in the public sector work force by an estimated 60,000 and a
reduction in the number of government ministries. A "new cruzado" was
created, equal to 1,000 old cruzados and worth about $1. The government
also suspended the program that allows foreign banks to reallocate loans
denominated in Brazilian currency that are due to the Central Bank before
they are due to foreign creditors ("relending") and imposed new controls on
debt to equity conversions. Congress has since approved several of the

IV-28
components of the plan, including the price freeze, fiscal targets, and
elimination of the wage indexing rule.
Following the announcement of the measures and a two-day bank
holiday, the Central Bank authorities have been holding the overnight
interest rate at roughly 25 percent per month. In the parallel market, the
dollar premium over the official exchange rate fell from more than 70
percent before the plan's announcement to about 45 percent in the period
after the announcement, before increasing to about 60 percent at the end of
January. The 1988 trade surplus was the largest ever at over $19 billion.
To be eligible to receive the next $600 million drawing from last
year's $5.2 billion new money agreement with commercial banks, Brazil needs
to gain World Bank Executive Board approval for a controversial $500
million power sector loan. This loan has not yet been scheduled for
Executive Board consideration. Brazil must receive a waiver of performance
criteria and agree on an economic plan for 1989 to receive the next tranch
of its stand-by arrangement with the IMF. The tranche is for only SDR 31
million. After some delay, Brazil made a scheduled $530 million interest
payment to commercial banks in January.
In Argentina, a military uprising was suppressed without violence
during December 2-5, 1988. On January 23, 1989, insurgents of uncertain
affiliation were suppressed following heavy fighting after invading a
military base. These incidents have not directly endangered Argentine
democracy or economic stability, but they have contributed to uncertainty
associated with upcoming presidential elections in May.

IV-29
Inflation has continued to decline in recent months, falling from 9.1
percent on a monthly basis in October to 5.7 percent in November and 6.8
percent in December. In December 1988, Congress approved the 1988 budget
and a tax reform package for 1989. In early January 1989, the government
and business groups agreed to extend the current system of negotiated price
increases and exchange rate depreciation from February until the end of
June. Exchange rates for various categories of imports and exports will be
unified by the end of the year. The combined fiscal deficit, which
includes operating losses of the Central Bank, declined from 7.1 percent of
GDP in 1987 to an estimated 5.3 percent in 1988. To achieve targets
required by loans recently approved by the World Bank, the deficit must be
reduced to 2.4 percent of GDP in 1989.
In December 1988, Argentina made a payment of $70 million in overdue
interest on new money loans made in 1985 and 1987. This followed a $100
million payment in October 1988, and brought these loans current through
the end of 1988; however, interest arrears on earlier loans currently
exceed $2 billion. The authorities are currently negotiating with the
commercial banks on a new financing package for 1989. Talks on a new
program with the IMF are continuing as well.
In Venezuela, outgoing President Lusinchi in late December announced
a three-month suspension of payments on principal on public debt to
commercial banks effective January 17. Interest continues to be paid. The
Bank Advisory Committee agreed to the suspension on January 12. President-
elect Perez is expected to implement major economic policy changes with the

IV-30
support of the IMF and World Bank and begin negotiations on rescheduling
the foreign commercial bank debt soon after his inauguration on February 2.
Venezuela registered a current account deficit of $5 billion last
year as imports surged. A fall in oil export revenues more than offset a
30 percent increase in non-oil export revenues. The deficit was financed
mainly through an expansion of trade credit and a draw-down in reserves.
At the end of December, Colombia reached agreement with commercial
banks providing roughly $1.7 billion in new money during 1989 and 1990 to
refinance $1.85 billion in maturing obligations. Commitments to the
financing package are currently being raised. The bank advisory committee
has endorsed a 90-day postponement of principal repayments, starting
January 1, 1989, pending completion of the loan.
On February 1, Peru's government announced major economic policy
changes to be implemented over the next four months. The currency was
devalued by 23.9 percent devaluation. Also planned are cuts in subsidies
on public sector goods, increases in oil prices, increases in the minimum
wage, and further devaluations.
The government's measures and implicit acknowledgement of IMF and
World Bank support signal a major effort to reintegrate Peru into the world
financial community. Deteriorating economic conditions over the past few
months had intensified social unrest and contributed to the growing
opposition within President Garcia's ruling party. In December 1988,
prices were 1,700 percent higher than a year earlier. In early January,
price and wage adjustments were announced and the official exchange rate
was devalued by 26 percent.
