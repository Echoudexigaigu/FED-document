DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity appears to have remained fairly robust in early 1989.
While the fragmentary information on expenditures is ambiguous, gains in
jobs and personal income clearly were sizable in the January-February
period. Inflation picked up in the past few months; in part this reflected
large increases in food and energy prices, but prices of other goods and
services accelerated too. Wage increases also appear to be trending upward
against a backdrop of tightening labor markets and increasingly numerous
reports of labor shortages.
Labor Market Developments
The demand for labor remained strong in the first two months of 1989.
Nonfarm payroll employment grew 290,000 in February, after a weather-boosted
increase of 415,000 in January, and these employment gains raised the
aggregate hours of production workers in January and February to a level
about 3 percent (annual rate) higher than in the fourth quarter of 1988.
The rise in employment was paced by further steady increases in the
service-producing sector, most notably in retail and wholesale trade and in
services. Employment in the goods-producing sector also rose on net over
the two months, but the increase was concentrated in January. In
particular, jobs at construction sites declined 20,000 last month after a
large January rise; unusually mild weather in January probably accounted for
part of this up-and-down pattern. Manufacturing employment also dipped in
February after four months of sizable increases. The February decline was
more than accounted for by layoffs in the automobile industry and followed a

similar increase in January. Elsewhere in manufacturing, producers of
nonelectrical machinery and fabricated metal products continued to add
workers.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent in
February from 5.4 percent in January and a 5.3 percent average in the fourth
quarter. The drop in the unemployment rate last month may have been
exaggerated by large declines in the rates for teenagers, young adults (ages
20-24), and Hispanics--groups whose unemployment rates typically exhibit
much month-to-month variability. Nonetheless, smoothing through these
fluctuations, joblessness in these groups appears to be on the decline. The
unemployment rate for adults 25 years old and up, at about 4 percent in
February, has continued to trend downward and is at its lowest level since
1979.
Quantitative data on labor costs in the first quarter are limited to
the readings on average hourly earnings, which were little changed in
February after a large increase in January. On average, the increase so far
this year was about in line with the pace over the past 12 months.
Qualitative reports--such as those in the March "Beigebook"--suggest that
upward pressures on wages are widespread across the country.
Revised data for the fourth quarter show unit labor costs in the
nonfarm business sector up 5-1/2 percent at an annual rate; this rise
brought the increase over 1988 as a whole to about 4 percent. The pickup in
unit labor costs last year reflected both an acceleration in compensation
and a slowing of productivity growth. Output per hour was virtually
unchanged in the fourth quarter and up only about 3/4 percent over the year
as a whole, below the staff's estimate of the 1-1/4 percent trend. The

slowing of productivity last year may be a manifestation of the relative
scarcity of labor and high capacity utilization rates, which probably have
forced some businesses to employ workers and facilities that are less
productive than those already in use.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Activity in the industrial sector leveled off in February, after rising
at about a 5 percent annual rate since October of last year. A reduced rate
of auto assemblies held down the increase in total output 0.1 percentage
point in both January and February. Assemblies of trucks were little
changed, on balance, over the past two months, although at a level that was
well above their fourth-quarter average. In addition to the decline in auto
assemblies, output of materials fell 0.4 percent in February. Much of the
weakness in recent months has occurred in energy materials, particularly
coal. However, in February, output of durable materials fell, with declines
in consumer durable parts and in basic metal materials, particularly steel.
Outside of these areas, production gains have been well maintained.
Home goods output, including appliances, is still strong, and consumer
nondurables, although up only 0.2 percent in February, are likely to post
another solid gain for the quarter as a whole. The output of business
equipment, after slowing in the fourth quarter of last year, has risen
rapidly in recent months. Production of office and computing equipment has
been exceptionally robust, and output of manufacturing equipment has
strengthened as well. A significant portion of this recent surge in
domestic equipment production likely resulted from continued strong foreign
demand. At this point, there is little hard information on the sources of
demand in the first quarter. However, for the past few years, exports have

accounted for a steadily growing share of domestically produced capital
goods, and that trend extended through the fourth quarter (chart). On the
import side, domestic producers of noncomputer equipment appear to have
slowed--although not reversed--their loss of market share in the United
States; imports of computers, however, have continued to grow rapidly.
The operating rate for all industries edged down in February, as did
capacity utilization in manufacturing, particularly at primary processors.
Despite drops in utilization of more than 1 percentage point in February for
primary metals, petroleum products, and paper, these basic industries
continue to operate at relatively high rates. And the operating rate for
chemicals and products, which also edged off, still is above past cyclical
peaks. For primary processing as a whole, capacity utilization is more than
1-1/2 percentage points above the average of 1978-79--a period of
accelerating materials prices. Moreover, operating rates in advanced
processing industries are nearly at their 1978-79 average.
Personal Consumption Expenditures
Consumer spending appears to have slowed somewhat in the first quarter,
after rising more than 3-1/2 percent in real terms last year. The slowing
has been concentrated in spending on goods and on energy services. Outlays
for non-energy services, which had increased steadily over the course of
1988, posted another sizable rise in January.
Revised figures indicate that sales at the PCE control grouping of
retail stores1 increased sharply in nominal terms around the turn of the
year. And while advance estimates showed little change in these outlays in
1. The PCE control category excludes sales at automotive dealers and
building material and supply stores, and gasoline sales at gasoline
stations.

February, spending levels were well above the fourth-quarter average.
However, prices for these items also have risen sharply in recent months,
and when measured in real terms, the average level of the PCE control in
January and February probably was only about 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate
above the fourth-quarter level.
Consumption this quarter also is being damped by the effects of
January's unseasonably warm weather on spending for fuel oil, electricity,
and natural gas. Assuming that heating bills returned to more normal levels
in February and March, lower energy consumption in the first quarter still
is expected to cut roughly 3/4 percentage point at an annual rate from
growth in total PCE spending.
Gains in consumer spending continue to be buttressed by sizable
increases in income. Real disposable income rose nearly 4 percent last year
and was up another 1 percent in January. The magnitude of the January
advance reflects both the strong employment and wage gains and some non-
recurring special factors, notably a step-up in farm proprietors' income
associated with BEA's assumption of a January 1 rebound in farm output and
an increase in transfer payments resulting from cost-of-living adjustments
in social security and other federal transfer programs. In addition, the
sharp rise in wages and salaries probably was exaggerated by the effects on
payrolls of the mild weather. Nonetheless, even abstracting from these
transitory factors, underlying income growth remains strong.
The jump in disposable income in January, coupled with relatively weak
growth in consumer outlays, pushed the personal saving rate to 5.8 percent,
compared with an average of 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1988.

II-12
Taking a longer perspective, the saving rate has been moving up since mid-
1987. Among other things, this rise in the saving rate probably reflects
some reversal of the stimulus to consumption that was provided by the
booming stock market earlier in the expansion. Stock prices, of course,
have recovered some since the crash. Nonetheless, overall household net
worth has not kept pace with the growth in income, and the wealth-to-income
ratio currently is no higher than its 1985-86 average value.
Autos and Trucks
Sales of domestically produced cars have averaged about 7 million units
at an annual rate since the turn of the year. However, adding in the strong
sales at the end of 1988, the underlying sales pace still looks to be on the
order of 7-1/4 to 7-1/2 million units annually. Meanwhile, light truck
sales have held steady at about a 4 million unit pace since September, while
imported cars have continued to trend down. The decline in foreign car
sales over the past year and a half likely reflects a combination of higher
prices for many models and increased production in the United States of
Japanese makes.
Inventories of domestically produced automobiles remained a bit hefty
at the end of February, at roughly 1.65 million units. Domestic automakers
apparently expect inventory burdens to be eased by a pickup in sales,
perhaps induced by more generous incentives this spring. They lowered
production 700,000 units in February to a 6.9 million unit annual rate (BEA
seasonals), and current schedules call for assemblies in March at about the
same rate. However, assemblies are scheduled to move up to a 7.3 million
unit average pace during the second quarter.

Business Fixed Investment
[Unpublished detail on orders and shipments are provided to the Board
on a confidential basis. The information from Boeing also should be
treated as proprietary.]
After a moderate decline in the fourth quarter, business capital
spending appears to have rebounded in the current quarter with healthy
2increases in outlays for both equipment and structures. Weighted
shipments of nondefense capital goods rose 1.1 percent in February to a
level 3 percent above their fourth-quarter average. Shipments of
machinery have been strong in recent months, but sales of office and
computing machinery have remained soft (chart). As for motor vehicles,
business purchases of automobiles have been sluggish after a strong fourth
quarter, while purchases of heavy-weight trucks have remained robust.
Looking ahead, moderate increases in equipment spending appear to be in the
offing, as the January/February average of weighted PDE new orders,
excluding the aircraft group, was 2 percent above the fourth-quarter level.
2. Some analysts have suggested that seasonally adjusted fourth-quarter
spending on PDE was artificially weak, and first-quarter spending will be
artificially strong, because seasonal factors have been distorted by
earlier tax-induced bulges for end-of-year equipment spending. An
examination of the evolution of the seasonal factors does not reveal any
support for this hypothesis.
3. This series is the weighted sum of shipments in 25 individual
industries and approximates the procedure used by BEA to construct its
current-quarter estimate of equipment spending (excluding aircraft). The
weights are equal to the fraction of domestic shipments (shipments less
exports) in a given industry that are allocated to investment spending; the
weights are significantly less than 1 in industries such as engines and
turbines whose output consists largely of intermediate inputs. Weights for
individual industries also are reduced to the extent that their output is
purchased by consumers or the government. The unweighted shipments series
(excluding aircraft) increased 0.5 percent in February to a level
3.0 percent above the fourth-quarter average.

Moving beyond the near term, deliveries of aircraft are expected to
provide considerable support to equipment outlays, as well as to exports, in
coming years. Backlogs of orders for aircraft, which were largely unchanged
from 1980 to the start of 1987, have doubled over the past two years. Most
notably, the Boeing Company, which supplies 60 percent of the world market,
has a current backlog of over 1,100 orders for new commercial jets.4
Although Boeing currently is operating at full tilt, they plan to increase
production over the next year by 25 percent--from the current rate of about
26 jets per month to 32 per month. This will be accomplished, in part,
through improvements in productivity and borrowing workers from other
aircraft manufacturers. Boeing already has brought a small contingent of
Lockheed employees to Washington.
In the area of nonresidential structures, construction put-in-place
rose sharply for a second month in January to a level 4-1/4 percent above
the fourth-quarter average. Gains were recorded in almost all categories of
building. The size of these increases is somewhat surprising in light of
the downtrend in contracts (except for industrial buildings) over the past
year and may have been exaggerated by the unusually mild weather around the
turn of the year. Petroleum drilling, which declined through much of 1988,
appears to be firming as the number of drilling rigs in use rose 6 percent
in February.
Business Inventories
Inventories generally appear to be in line with sales, although there
are some exceptions--notably auto dealers and computer makers.
4. Between one-third and one-half of the current backlog of orders is from
domestic airlines and thus will be reflected in equipment outlays; the
remainder will be exported.

II-19
Manufacturing inventories rose $9-1/2 billion (1982 prices) at an annual
rate in the fourth quarter, following average increases of about $6 billion
in the preceding two quarters. Separate current-cost data show that factory
inventories posted a sharp rise in January, with more than half of the
accumulation in the aircraft and nonelectrical machinery industries.
The concentration of manufacturing inventory investment in aircraft and
nonelectrical machinery has been evident for some time. In the aircraft
industry, the stockbuilding has coincided with booming orders and consists
largely of parts and components awaiting final assembly. In the case of
nonelectrical machinery, the accumulation has been concentrated in office
and computing equipment and has taken place primarily at the finished goods
level. Although output of computers slowed somewhat in the second half of
last year, the softening in demand apparently was not fully anticipated by
the manufacturers. Their inventory-to-shipments ratio has been increasing
steadily since mid-1988, and in January reached its highest level in two
years (chart). Inventories of other types of nonelectrical machinery have
remained in line with shipments.
The inventory situation at nonauto trade establishments has been
relatively stable. Recent revisions to retail inventory data, together with
the concurrent revision to retail sales data, generally lowered inventory-
sales ratios in this sector. In particular, the revisions eliminated the
upward drift that emerged in 1988 in the ratio for nonauto retail
establishments; it now is little different than in previous years.
Housing Markets
Housing activity has fluctuated appreciably in recent months. Starts
in January surged to nearly 1.7 million units at an annual rate, boosted by

a combination of temperatures that were nationally 5 degrees higher than
usual on a construction-weighted basis and below-normal amounts of
precipitation. With the return of more typical weather conditions in
February, starts dropped to a 1.5 million unit rate. The average pace of
starts so far this year is a bit above that in the fourth quarter, but the
less volatile permits series has shown a decline, perhaps signaling the
beginning of a response to tightening mortgage market conditions.
Consumer assessments of the homebuying climate apparently have changed
little, on balance, in recent months (chart). In February, about two-thirds
of the respondents to the Michigan Survey described these conditions as
favorable, fewer than in the first half of 1988, but about the same as in
the latter half. However, the impetus to homebuying for some now appears to
be coming from fears of future increases in mortgage rates. Throughout most
of 1988, respondents typically cited low mortgage interest rates and the
availability of good buys as the chief reasons for their favorable
assessments.
Federal Government
In February, the federal government recorded a budget deficit of $27.9
billion with outlays of $89.9 billion and revenues of $62.0 billion. For
the first five months of the fiscal year, the budget deficit was $92.7
billion compared with $90.3 billion over the same period of the previous
year. Revenues in FY1989 are 7-1/2 percent above a year earlier, reflecting
continued increases in nominal income and employment, as well as strength in
corporate income tax receipts stemming, at least in part, from tax reform.
Outlays so far in FY1989 are 6-1/2 percent, or $29 billion, higher than
a year earlier. Increases in net outlays by FSLIC have accounted for $10

II-23
billion of the total rise. Excluding FSLIC, outlays have risen 4-1/4
percent. The other major sources of growth have been social security, net
interest, and defense. These three functions account for 60 percent of
total budget expenditures and 65 percent of the non-FSLIC growth. Among
other programs, agriculture expenditures have remained below last year's
levels because of drought-induced reductions in Commodity Credit Corporation
net outlays.

1. Net FSLIC outlays rose from -$0.4 billion in the first five months of
FY1988 to $9.4 billion this year.
The February projections for the FY1989 budget by the Office of
Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office point to a deficit
of about $160 billion, slightly higher than in the past two years, but
relatively constant in real terms and slowly shrinking as a share of GNP.
For FY1990, the Bush Administration has proposed to reduce the budget
deficit to $91 billion, or $95 billion excluding asset sales. These results
are premised on achievement of 3-1/2 percent growth in real GNP this year
and a sharp decline in interest rates. Policy initiatives include measures
to raise $5-1/2 billion in revenues, on net, relative to current law. Most

II-24
of the increase is expected to result from higher realizations of capital
gains induced by a proposed tax rate reduction for selected assets. The
President's budget also calls for outlay reductions of $27 billion relative
to those estimated to result from current laws and policies. The plan would
hold growth in total outlays between FY1989 and FY1990 to $11 billion
(excluding the effects of asset sales) or only 0.9 percent. The CBO, using
less optimistic economic assumptions, projects a budget deficit of $109
billion (without asset sales) assuming full enactment of the Bush
Administration program. The estimate by the Administration (which will be
the relevant one for the Gramm-Rudman sequestration process) is below the
Gramm-Rudman target of $100 billion; both estimates are below the $110
billion trigger that would cause a sequester.
State and Local Government Sector
Recent data on the activities of state and local governments are mixed;
employment has strengthened, but spending on construction has dropped. In
February, employment rose further to a level 0.6 percent above the fourth-
quarter average. However, real outlays for construction fell nearly 3
percent in January, after a substantial jump in the closing months of last
year. Variation in spending for streets and highways accounted for much of
the December-January movement. Over 1988 as a whole, revised NIPA data show
that total building outlays rose 2-3/4 percent, a percentage point more than
in 1987, but still below the pace of the mid-1980s.
Widespread fiscal woes apparently have continued to restrain spending
by state governments. On the revenue side, only a few governors have
submitted proposals for major sales or income tax increases this year.
However, other revenue-raising measures are being sought, including

II-25
increases in gasoline taxes--some quite large--and in cigarette and alcohol
taxes. In addition, many states are looking to user fees as a source of
revenue; for example, increases in highway user charges are being discussed
in California and Florida, and some states are considering larger fees for
automobile registrations and drivers' licenses. Some local governments face
prospects of reduced state aid, but many recently have been--or expect to
be--granted broader taxing powers, notably the authority to impose local
income taxes.
Prices
Prices accelerated further in early 1989. Much of this pickup
reflected larger price increases for food and energy, but price increases
also accelerated for a broad range of nonfood, nonenergy goods and services.
The uptrend in inflation at the finished goods level likely has reflected
the passthrough of increases in labor and materials costs.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI increased about 1/2 percent per
month in January and February, a bit more than in 1988. Prices of nonenergy
services, up 0.5 percent in both months, have been rising more rapidly than
last year; in February, they were boosted by a large increase in the cost of
out-of-town lodging and a further sharp rise in the price of medical
services. Meanwhile, the prices of goods advanced only 0.2 percent last
month; tobacco prices, which had surged in January, were up another 1
percent, while apparel prices were down. The decline in apparel prices,
however, is likely to be followed by substantial increases in the next two
months as spring merchandise is introduced into the CPI sample. On balance,
prices of other nonfood, nonenergy goods advanced moderately last month. In
the PPI, capital equipment prices have posted sizable advances in recent

months, with higher prices for many types of machinery and for motor
vehicles.
Producers continued to face rising costs for raw and intermediate
materials in early 1989, although the pace of those increases may be ebbing
a bit. The PPI for intermediate materials excluding food and energy
increased 0.5 percent on average in January and February, down slightly from
its average monthly pace in 1988. At earlier stages of processing, the PPI
for crude nonfood, nonenergy materials was flat in February, held down by
falling prices for raw cotton and scrap. However, on spot commodity
markets, prices have firmed a bit recently. Since the end of January, the
Journal of Commerce index of industrial prices has risen 2 percent, boosted
by sizable increases in the prices of oil and industrial metals,
particularly tin and zinc.
Food Prices. The CPI for food rose 0.6 percent per month, on average,
over the first two months of 1989, slightly higher than the average pace
over the last three quarters of 1988. The persistence of price pressures in
the food area partly reflects lagged effects of the drought, but there also
are indications of inflationary pressures similar to those at work in other
sectors. For example, the price increases of recent months have encompassed
not only those food items that are most sensitive to farm supply conditions,
but also many items that are more heavily keyed to the cost of labor and
other nonfarm inputs. According to USDA data, the costs of packaging and
advertising have been trending up rapidly in the food sector, and data on
average hourly earnings show that wage trends in food marketing have moved
up a notch or so from the very subdued pace of the 1984-87 period.

The risk of food price pressures persisting into the spring is growing.
The producer prices of finished foods registered a second month of steep
advance in February, and a drop in the prices of crude foods last month is
likely to be followed by a big rise in March. Egg prices have increased
especially rapidly since mid-February, and this surge probably has been
passed to consumers with virtually no lag at all.
Taking a somewhat longer view, most indicators of food price prospects
still provide reason for expecting a significant easing of price pressures
later on in 1989. In contrast to the recent increases in the current prices
of farm products, futures prices generally have shown relatively little
movement in recent weeks, although the continued drought in the Central
Plains has caused noticeable skittishness in the market for wheat. In
livestock markets, concerns about a sharp drop in meat supplies in 1989 seem
to have eased a bit, owing to a recent Agriculture Department report that
showed a larger inventory of cattle than most observers had been expecting;
in its March forecast of supply-demand conditions for 1989, the USDA
projected that the total production of meat and poultry this year, in fact,
will be fractionally higher than in 1988. The prospects for the supplies
and prices of both crops and livestock will be sensitive, of course, to
weather conditions as the spring planting season gets under way in coming
weeks.
Energy Prices. Consumer energy prices increased 0.8 percent in January
and 0.6 percent in February, as higher crude oil prices were passed through
to the prices of gasoline and fuel oil. Posted prices for West Texas
Intermediate crude oil rose $5 per barrel from mid-November to mid-January,
and have since held at about $17.50 per barrel. Given the typical lags

II-30
between movements in crude oil prices and the retail prices of refined
energy products, prices for gasoline and fuel oil in the February CPI seem
to embody almost all of the run-up in crude costs. After advancing sharply
in the fourth quarter, electricity prices receded slightly in January and
February, while natural gas prices have risen significantly during the past
half year.
Gasoline prices are expected to rise somewhat this summer in response
to government action designed to curb air pollution. New EPA limits are
being placed on the "volatility" of gasoline--the tendency of gas to
evaporate--and several states are requesting waivers so they can impose a
stricter standard. Lower volatility gasoline requires higher crude oil
inputs. With domestic refineries currently handling nearly as much crude as
they can, the staff estimates that tighter gas supplies will probably push
prices up about 3 cents per gallon this summer; outside estimates range from
1/2 to 10 cents per gallon. Because the new volatility standards apply only
in the summer, gas prices should retrace their rise during the winter.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Under the influence of System tightening actions, short-term interest
rates have risen considerably since the February FOMC meeting. In contrast
to some other recent periods of firming money market conditions, the latest
has seen long-term interest rates rise noticeably as well, owing largely to
heightened concerns about inflation. In addition, share price indexes are
down, on balance, over the intermeeting period, having slumped along with
the bond market in recent days.
Growth in the monetary aggregates has been sluggish. M2 has remained
below its annual target cone, as deposit rates have continued to lag behind
rising market yields. M3 has grown somewhat more rapidly than M2, tracking
along the bottom of its annual range; banks have been heavy issuers of
managed liabilities, partly to fund the huge RJR-Nabisco transaction.
Bolstered by the surge in bank loans to business, private debt growth
appears to have picked up considerably from January's pace. Commercial
paper of nonfinancial firms has continued to grow rapidly and bond issuance
has recovered somewhat. While consumer credit expansion remains moderate,
growth in home mortgage debt appears to have picked up from its relatively
sluggish fourth-quarter pace.
In the current quarter, federal borrowing has declined, although much
less than seasonally. State and local debt issuance also is expected to
remain somewhat below the pace of last quarter, in part reflecting a falloff
in advance refunding issues.
III-1

III-2
Interest Rate Developments
The federal funds rate has risen almost 3/4 percentage point since the
last FOMC meeting, mainly in response to the 1/2 percentage point increase
in the discount rate on February 24. Other private short-term rates have
risen even more, around one percentage point, with CD and commercial paper
rates perhaps reflecting supply pressures associated with the surge in
business financings. Banks have implemented two half-point increases in the
prime rate; the rate seems at present to be in a reasonably normal alignment
with money market yields.
Treasury bill rates have risen only 50 to 60 basis points over the
intermeeting period. The pressure on bill yields as well as on other
Treasury rates has been diminished a bit by continued strong retail demand
reflected in noncompetitive tenders. Intermediate- and long-term Treasury
rates have moved up by comparable amounts, reacting to the rise in short-
term rates and to heightened concerns about inflationary pressures and
attendant risks of further tightening by the System. Increases in Treasury
note and bond yields came on the heels of the strong February employment
data and the much larger-than-expected February jump in the producer price
index. Yields on corporate and municipal bonds, and conventional mortgage
rates, have moved up along with those on Treasuries. Secondary market
yields on fixed-rate mortgage instruments, however, have risen more than
Treasuries, reflecting increased interest rate uncertainty and, reportedly,
concerns about large sales of mortgage securities by thrift institutions.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Expansion in the monetary aggregates remained subdued in February. For
Ml, the 1-3/4 percent growth registered last month primarily reflected some

recovery in demand deposits after January's sharp runoff. M2 increased at a
similar pace, as deposit inflows at commercial banks and general
purpose/broker-dealer MMMFs partially offset continued outflows experienced
by FSLIC-insured thrifts. Since the fourth quarter of 1988, M2 has grown at
about February's 1-3/4 percent annual rate, leaving it below the 3 percent
lower bound of its 1989 growth cone. Data through mid-March suggest some
strengthening of M2.
The continued weakness in core deposits probably is attributable to the
rising opportunity cost of holding these balances, perhaps together with
depositors' concerns occasioned by the thrift crisis. The weak demand for
retail deposits over the past few months has been mirrored by a surge in
noncompetitive tenders for Treasury bills and notes. From last quarter's
sizable $1.5 billion monthly average, these tenders surged to $5.6 billion
in January and $4.3 billion in February.
A brisk runoff in savings and MMDA deposits was more than offset by a
pickup in retail CDs and M2-type MMMFs, evidently reflecting depositors'
reactions to yield spreads that greatly favor these instruments. In
February, for example, the 3 percentage point spread between average rates
paid on six-month retail CDs and average rates on liquid retail deposits was
more than one point above the 1988 average (top panel of chart 1). The
bottom panel of the chart shows the shifting toward retail CDs that has
accompanied this wider spread.
At thrifts, only about a third of the runoff in liquid retail deposits
in February was offset by inflows to small CDs. Instead, apparently with
1. Among thrifts, runoffs have been concentrated at FSLIC-insured
institutions, as opposed to those that are FDIC-insured or credit unions.

regulatory encouragement, thrifts have been using FHLB advances to replace
funds lost in part through greater restraint on their deposit rates. During
February, advances are estimated to have grown about $5 billion on a month-
end basis (seasonally adjusted). Since the middle of 1988, the less
aggressive pricing of retail deposits by thrifts has been reflected in a
declining margin of thrift deposit rates over bank rates. The share of
household deposits held at thrifts has declined over the same period, with
the shift perhaps accentuated recently by public concerns about the thrift
situation.
Inflows to M2-type money funds surged in February from the already
strong pace of the preceding two months. Taxable money funds recently have
been yielding about 2-1/2 percentage points more than MMDAs--or about a
quarter point less than 3-month Treasury bills. Retail depositors appear to
be shifting balances from thrifts to money funds, as well as to banks and
Treasury securities.
M3 grew at a 3-1/2 percent rate in February, a bit above January's
pace, accounted for largely by the turnaround in M2 growth. Partial data
for March suggest a further strengthening in M3 growth. Since the fourth
quarter of last year, M3 has grown at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate, the
lower bound of its 1989 range. Net large time deposits accelerated to a
15 percent pace in February as banks, faced with a surge in credit demand,
increased their use of managed liabilities; at thrifts, large CDs declined.
Bank credit grew at a 14-1/2 percent annual rate last month, paced by a
pickup in business and security loans. Business loans, which were boosted
by the $8 billion extended to KKR for the purchase of RJR-Nabisco shares,
soared to a 24 percent annual pace. Security loans jumped nearly $7 billion

during the month, possibly due to primary dealers' need to finance larger
Treasury positions.
Real estate loan growth--at 13 percent--was a little faster in
February, as home equity loans picked up. A slowing in consumer lending at
banks, to just a 3 percent rate, mainly reflected heavy securitization; when
adjusted for issuance of loan-backed securities, consumer loans expanded at
a 6-1/2 percent annual rate, down only slightly from the 7-1/2 percent rate
in January.
Business Finance
Total net borrowing by nonfinancial businesses appears to have
strengthened considerably since the last FOMC meeting owing mainly, but not
entirely, to the RJR-Nabisco deal. This buyout is expected to boost net
equity retirements to a record annual rate of more than $200 billion in the
current quarter. Growth of bank loans plus commercial paper surged to a
25 percent pace in February as the current rate environment encouraged firms
to finance large merger and nonmerger needs with shorter-term sources of
funds. Bond financing, however, was buoyed by an increase in private
placements associated with the RJR-Nabisco deal.
Although public bond offerings by nonfinancial firms jumped in March,
the new issues were concentrated in the one- to five-year maturity range.
Borrowers generally have combined these shorter-term fixed-rate issues with
interest rate swaps, creating synthetic floating-rate liabilities at a cost
lower than the LIBOR benchmark. The proceeds from many of these issues
apparently are being used to pay down other forms of short-term debt;
business borrowing from large banks did, in fact, slow substantially in
early March, though commercial paper issuance continued to surge.

Apart from these shorter-term swap-driven issues, overall public bond
issuance remains relatively weak; many firms reportedly are anticipating
lower interest rates later this year. For investment grade industrial
firms, in addition, investors' concerns about "event risk" continue to deter
long-term issuance. Only two such firms have issued debt with maturities of
twenty years or longer in the four months since the RJR buyout announcement.
Issuance of junk bonds also has been relatively light since the last
FOMC meeting, but volume is expected to increase soon. In particular, RJR
shareholders are slated to receive $1.8 billion in junk bonds in the second
phase of the buyout sometime in the second quarter. Low-grade bond issuance
in the public market also is expected to be bolstered when the $5 billion in
notes placed privately for RJR are replaced before midyear.
The early-year rally in stock prices fizzled out in February and a
rebound in March was ended by the disappointing PPI report. Small
investors, however, may have shown some renewed interest in stocks, for
equity mutual funds registered positive net inflows during January and
February, the first two consecutive monthly inflows since the 1987 crash.
Municipal Securities
New issues of long-term municipal securities totaled about $8 billion
in February, up from January's modest volume of $6-1/2 billion; in March,
long-term issues are expected to total about $9 billion, close to the
average monthly pace of last year. February's increase was accounted for by
issues for new capital; refunding issues, which tend to be more interest-
sensitive, were down.
Yields on long-term municipal securities drifted up about 35 basis
points in the intermeeting period, roughly in line with yields on taxable

securities. The ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields has hovered near the
current level since its substantial decline in August.

f--forecast.
Commercial banks have, since 1986, been trimming their holdings of
tax-exempt securities. Because their ability to deduct 80 percent of
the carrying costs on newly acquired tax-exempt bonds is restricted to
instruments issued by units that do not expect to issue more than
$10 million of bonds during the year, bank holdings have been largely
determined by the pace at which pre-tax reform acquisitions are maturing.
Thus far in 1989 "bank-qualified" municipal issues have accounted for about
five percent of total long-term municipal volume.

III-12
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff forecast for the first-quarter federal budget deficit is
$60 billion on a not seasonally adjusted basis, down about $7 billion from
the deficit posted last quarter. A portion of the deficit is expected to be
financed by an $18 billion decline in the Treasury's cash balance, in
advance of the large seasonal inflow of funds from tax payments in April.
Marketable borrowing is expected to fall about $7 billion from the fourth-
quarter level, the reduction being more than accounted for by an expected
$13 billion decrease in new cash raised in bill auctions. Gross auction
sizes of most coupon issues have been boosted; stripping activity remained
at a surprisingly robust $3-1/4 billion pace in both January and February
following December's $4-1/2 billion volume. "Other borrowing" is expected
to fall off sharply in the first quarter, after being boosted in the fourth
quarter by heavy issuance of FSLIC notes.
Borrowing by federally sponsored credit agencies continues to be
dominated by the Federal Home Loan Banks. Over the past four months, FHLB
borrowing has averaged more than $4 billion per month, accounting for more
than 80 percent of all borrowing by sponsored agencies. This heavy issuance
of debt, reflecting FSLIC-insured thrifts' increased reliance on advances,
has markedly increased yield differentials between FHLB and Treasury
securities in recent weeks. For example, in the mid-March offering, the
spread on the FHLB 3-month note was 74 basis points, up from February's
spread of 25 basis points. The recent widening in spreads also reflects
expectations that FHLB credit demands will continue to be large over the
near term.

Spreads between FICO issues and 30-year Treasury bonds, in contrast,
fell after the announcement of the savings and loan resolution plan, as
investors apparently assumed that the proposal strengthened the government's
implicit commitment to back FICO debt. At the most recent public offering
of these bonds in March, the spread was a record low of 47 basis points,
down from 69 basis points in late December. The $600 million of securities
issued in March brought FICO's total borrowing since its creation in 1987
to $6.5 billion, placing it $4.3 billion below its authorized limit of
$10.8 billion.
Thrift Institutions
Retail deposits at FSLIC-insured institutions, on the month-end basis
reported by the FHLBB, ran off at a 7 percent seasonally adjusted rate in
January, considerably exceeding December's 4 percent outflow. Moreover,
large time deposits declined at nearly an 11 percent pace in January. In
contrast to December, the January deposit outflows were widespread, with
four out of five thrifts reporting withdrawals. Federal Reserve deposit
reports from large thrifts indicate that sizable outflows continued at these
institutions in February.
As noted above, many institutions partially substituted advances and
other borrowings for deposits, as reflected by the strong growth in these
liabilities. The Dallas and San Francisco FHLB districts accounted for the
bulk of new advances. While the strong demand in the Dallas district was
attributable to troubled institutions using FSLIC notes to collateralize
their advances, borrowers in the San Francisco district were primarily
healthy institutions engaged in liability management.

Reflecting heavy deposit runoffs, the assets of FSLIC-insured
institutions contracted at a 3-1/2 percent pace in January, following
2December's strong gains. By concentrating much of the asset adjustment
in relatively liquid asset categories such as investment securities and
mortgage-backed instruments, thrifts were able to continue moderate
expansion of their mortgage and consumer loan holdings. January's 7 percent
increase in mortgage loans was close to December's pace, while the
14-1/2 percent growth in consumer loans was the strongest since last May.
Under the Administration's reform plan for the thrift industry,
thrifts must meet the current commercial bank primary capital standards of
5.5 percent of total assets by June 1991. Based on quarterly data through
September 1988, GAAP solvent institutions would need an additional
$20 billion of capital--that is, retained earnings plus equity investments--
to meet this standard. However, banks currently are in the process of
phasing in a risk-based capital standard. Using this benchmark, which
assigns a risk weight of 50 percent to residential mortgages, the shortfall
is reduced to $15 billion. Insolvent thrift institutions would need about
$17 billion of primary capital and $14 billion of risk-adjusted capital to
match these standards.
The thrift industry as a whole may have difficulty raising new capital
at the roughly $12 billion per year needed to make up this risk-adjusted
2. About one-third of January's decline was attributable to the phase-in
of generally accepted accounting standards, which required the write-down of
certain asset categories, primarily those reflecting appraisal value of
buildings and other fixed assets.

capital shortfall by mid-1991. Retained earnings can be expected to make
only a minor contribution over the near future. Capital generated
externally through equity issuance would have to pick up greatly to cover
the difference. Between 1983 and 1988, equity offerings by thrifts averaged
less than $2 billion per year, while in the first two months of 1989, these
institutions raised only $113 million in equity capital. However, new
capital is likely to be forthcoming from those institutions acquiring
thrifts, and following reform, these institutions may find the capital
markets more receptive.
Equity prices of selected thrift institutions had risen by somewhat
more than the market from the beginning of the year to the announcement of
the Administration's plan on February 6. The day after this announcement,
thrift equity prices increased more than 2 percent. Since that time, thrift
equity prices have been considerably weaker than market indexes.
Mortgage Markets
Available data suggest that net mortgage debt growth has picked up in
the first quarter from last quarter's sluggish pace, perhaps reflecting the
surge in home sales at the end of 1988. Growth of real estate loans at
commercial banks strengthened in the first two months of the year, while
the volume of mortgage loans closed at FSLIC-insured institutions rose
5-1/2 percent in January.
January's recovery in lending activity helped to buoy issues of
federally related mortgage-backed pass-throughs, with a seasonally adjusted
volume of $14.1 billion. Although pass-through volume climbed throughout
1988, it remained well below the levels attained in the prior two years. In

contrast to the sustained pace of pass-throughs in recent months, the market
for private issues of multiclass mortgage securities--CMOs--has slowed
substantially, in part because of difficulty in marketing residual tranches
as investors have been concerned about further losses should rates move
higher.
Since the last FOMC meeting, increases in primary market rates on
mortgages have lagged the rise in secondary market yields, with the contract
rate on new commitments for 30-year fixed-rate conventional home loans up 50
basis points to 10.98 percent as of last week. The initial rate on ARMs
rose by a similar amount, to 9.02 percent, maintaining the spread between
the initial rate on FRMs and ARMs at almost 2 percentage points.
Relatively low initial rates on ARM loans spurred an increase in the
ARM share of conventional home mortgages closed at major lenders to
58 percent in early February. Aggressive pricing is evidenced by the
declining spread between the initial rate on ARMs and the one-year constant-
maturity Treasury yield, to a negative 60 basis points in February. In
addition, recent reports indicate that ARMs tied to the llth FHLB District
cost of funds index (COFI) have increased in popularity among borrowers,
since the sluggish behavior of this index allows ARM rates tied to it to
adjust more slowly to changes in market conditions.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit increased at close to an 8 percent annual
rate in both December and January, staying within the 7- to 10-percent
growth range that it maintained most of last year. This expansion has been
squarely in line with the growth of personal consumption, as typically has

been the case after the second or third year of economic upswings. In the
present case, however, changes in tax laws have been a special factor
encouraging reduced consumer debt use. Auto loan growth held steady at
about a 9 percent rate in January, while credit card debt--by far the
strongest component in 1988 decelerated noticeably further, to a rather low
5 percent pace. The sizable "all other" category--which includes personal
cash loans--showed stepped-up growth in January.
Interest rates on consumer loans at banks have been rising since last
spring. The largest rate increases have been recorded for new-car loans.
By early February, the average new-car finance rate had risen 1/2 percentage
point above the November level and was about 1-1/4 points above the average
for the May 1988 survey. Personal loan rates advanced 3/4 percentage point
between last May and February, but credit card rates, which normally are
sticky, were up only 5 basis points. The effects of such rate increases on
expenditures are likely to be small: on a $10,000, 4-year new-car loan, a
1-1/4 percentage point increase in interest rate (holding other loan terms
constant) would boost scheduled monthly payments by only $6 on a base
payment of more than $250.
Recent data on delinquent loans present mixed evidence on the ability
of consumers to meet loan payment obligations during the fourth quarter.
The average delinquency rate on closed-end consumer loans at banks increased
for the second consecutive quarter after two quarters of decline; however,
at 2.53 percent in the fourth quarter, it is still well below the cyclical
peak of 2.80 percent reached in 1980. Among its components, auto loans
showed relatively sharp increases and were near historically high levels.

III-22
Auto finance companies have also recorded rather large increases in past-due
loans in recent months. On the other hand, delinquency rates on credit card
accounts and home equity lines of credit at banks edged down last quarter.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In January, the seasonally adjusted U.S. merchandise trade deficit
was $9.5 billion (Census basis, customs valuation), compared with an
$11.0 billion revised deficit in December. Beginning with the January
1989 data, only customs valuation imports and f.a.s. exports appear in
the press release.
Recorded exports declined 4 percent in January, with decreases
recorded in almost all major trade categories. The value of imports
declined 7 percent. Increases in imports of oil (entirely because the
average price rose more than 10 percent) and industrial supplies
(primarily associated with chemicals and paper), were more than offset
by declines in all other major import categories. Part of the sharp

decrease in imports of consumer durables, computer accessories, and
other electronic components in January, followed strong increases
in those categories during the final months of 1988, and may reflect in
part the effects of the termination of GSP status on December 31, 1988
for Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.
The trade figures for January may be subject to larger revisions
than usual. Beginning with the January figures, in compliance with the
Trade Act of 1988, the data are based on two new commodity
classification systems: the International Harmonized System (HS) and
Revision 3 of the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC).
With the adoption of these systems, the United States joins most other
countries in reporting trade using common commodity classifications for
merchandise exports and imports. Because of this massive change in the
way each trader must identify products and the fact that many duty rate
classifications were changed to be consistent with the new system, the
amount of carry-over from month to month (documents tabulated in later
months for transactions occurring in an earlier month) during the first
few months of 1989 will probably be increased. As a result, the levels
of exports and imports may be understated in January for this reason
alone.
In the fourth quarter of 1988, the merchandise trade deficit on a
balance-of-payments basis was $128 billion (s.a.a.r.), $11 billion
larger than in the third quarter (revised). (See the table on the next
page.) Both exports and imports reached record levels. For the year
1988, the deficit was $126.5 billion, $34 billion smaller than in 1987.

Exports rose 2 percent in both current and constant dollars from
the third to the fourth quarter. The increase in nonagricultural
exports (4 percent in value and 3 percent in volume) was largely in
capital goods (other than aircraft) and automotive products. By area,
the value of nonagricultural exports increased to all areas of the world
with the exception of Japan and the Asian newly industrialized
economies.
Agricultural exports declined 6 percent in value and 5 percent in
volume in the fourth quarter, largely in soybeans and corn. The
decrease in soybeans, by 22 percent in volume and 11 percent in price,
was largely due to reduced shipments to Japan and Mexico. Exports of
corn declined 18 percent, all in volume, as decreases in shipments to
Japan and Western Europe outweighed an increase in shipments to the
Soviet Union. Partly offsetting these declines was an increase in
exports of wheat, by 11 percent in volume and 12 percent in price.
Non-oil imports rose 5 percent in nominal terms and 3 percent in
volume in the fourth quarter. The largest increases in volume were in
consumer goods and automotive products (particularly passenger cars from
Japan and Germany, which rose from somewhat depressed third-quarter
levels). Non-oil imports from industrial countries increased sharply.
There was also an increase in non-oil imports from Mexico (importantly
consumer goods and also automotive products).
The value of oil imports declined 6 percent in the fourth quarter
as higher volumes were more than offset by a drop in the average price.
(See the table on the next page.) The volume of oil imports rose

IV-5
sharply in December and continued at roughly that strong level in
January in reaction to the decline in prices last autumn brought about
by an increase in OPEC production. Since the OPEC accord in
mid-November, and accidents in the North Sea that restricted U.K.
production, spot prices and import prices have risen significantly.
OPEC production has been reduced roughly 2-1/2 to 3 mbd so far this year
from the rate in late 1988.

Import and Export Prices
In January, prices for imports and exports rose substantially (see

agricultural export prices also rose 0.9 percent.

are based on a sample of approximately 22,000 products collected from
over 8,300 companies, data for the monthly indexes are collected for
approximately 4,300 products from over 1,900 companies. Monthly price
indexes will be revised at the time of the quarterly press release. For
example, with the release of the March 1989 data, revision will be made
in the December 1988, January 1989, and February 1989 figures.
In the fourth quarter, prices of non-oil imports (n.s.a.) rose on
average 10 percent at an annual rate. This was the same rate of
increase as prevailed in the first two quarters of 1988 and followed a
price decline on average in the third quarter. Over the four quarters
of 1988, the increase in non-oil import prices was 7 percent. All the
major categories of imports shown in the table on the previous page
posted higher rates of price increase in the fourth quarter than in the
third. An important influence on these price movements was the exchange
value of the dollar, which declined during the fourth quarter after
appreciating during the third quarter.
Prices of exports on average declined at an annual rate of less
than 1 percent in the fourth quarter, led by a 21 percent decline in the
price of foods, feeds, and beverages, and a 4 percent drop in the price
of computers, peripherals, and parts. However, with the exception of
industrial supplies, prices of other exports rose at a faster pace in
the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Despite the large
fourth-quarter decline, the index for prices of exports of foods, feeds,
and beverages closed the year 21 percent higher than a year ago, due in
part to the summer drought. Prices for industrial supplies, capital

IV-8
goods (excluding computers), and consumer goods all showed increases
throughout each quarter of the year. For the year, prices of exports
rose by more than 6 percent on average (Q4/Q4).
U.S. Current Account: 1988-04
The U.S. current account deficit in 1988-Q4 narrowed $2.8 billion
(s.a.a.r.) from third-quarter levels. The reduction occurred because of
a large swing in capital gains on direct investment. This swing
reflected the impact of the dollar depreciation in 1988-Q4 on the dollar
value of foreign-currency denominated assets, liabilities, depreciation,
and inventory charges on the books of the foreign affiliates of U.S. firms.

Excluding capital gains, the current account deteriorated $20.5 billion
in the fourth quarter.
Roughly half of the $20.5 billion deterioration in the current
account deficit resulted from a worsening in the trade balance, and the
remainder was split between an increase in unilateral transfer payments
and a decline in military sales and other net services. The $4.9
billion increase in unilateral transfers abroad occurred as Israel drew
nearly all of the grant funds provided by the U.S. Government in the
first quarter of the fiscal year. The reduction in military sales (by
20 percent) occurred as deliveries under several programs were
completed. Receipts from foreigners for both travel and passenger-fare
services increased for the ninth consecutive quarter. However, payments
to foreigners for travel services also rose and, as a result, there was
little net change in this sector during the quarter. Net income on
private portfolio investment was little changed, though the gross flows
were boosted by higher U.S. interest rates and a step-up in bank
activity.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States increased net
by $1.7 billion in January, despite net intervention sales of dollars by
the G-10 countries and declines in their reserves in the United States.
(See line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.)
The composition of reserve assets held in the United States also
shifted, as several G-10 countries sold Treasury bills and acquired bank
deposits. Partial information for February indicates that the G-10

countries added about $0.8 billion net to their reserves held at the
FRBNY in that month.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities amounted
to $2.4 billion in January, above the monthly average rate of purchases
in 1988 (line 3). About one-third of this total was accounted for by
the World Bank, while the rest of the purchasers were concentrated in
Europe and Japan. Private foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds
(line 2a) were $1.5 billion, below the monthly average in 1988.
Issuance of Eurobonds by U.S. corporations, which had been very weak in
December, picked up substantially in the first quarter of 1989. Foreign
net purchases of U.S. stocks remained depressed in January (line 2b),
but U.S. net purchases of Japanese stocks (included in line 2c)
rebounded to more than $0.8 billion.
Banks reported substantial net outflows in January (line 1). The
bulk of the outflows involved transactions with own foreign offices, and
more than reversed the inflows that occurred in the last days of
December. As shown on the International Banking Data table on line 1
(see next page), on a monthly average basis, there was little change in
net claims of banks in the United States on their own foreign offices
and IBFs in the first two months of 1989.
The Department of Commerce recently released data for the fourth
quarter of 1988 on other international transactions. (See lines 6
through 10 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.)
For the year 1988, U.S. direct investment abroad fell substantially.

with currency translation effects, the major explanation was the sale of
assets by a financially pressed U.S. petroleum company. Foreign direct
investment in the United States (line 7) continued at very high levels
in 1988.
Other capital flows (line 8) showed a net inflow of $1 billion in
1988. Included in this total is the change in banks' claims and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Between the end of 1987
and the end of 1988 foreign currency claims increased by $15 billion (or
almost 30 percent) while liabilities increased by $16 billion (also
almost 30 percent). Since the dollar did not depreciate against most
currencies during this period, these increases were not the result of
converting foreign currencies to dollar values. The bulk of these
changes were reported by the IBFs of Japanese-based banks vis-a-vis
Japan. One possible explanation for these developments is that
essentially domestic Japanese transactions are being booked at IBFs of
Japanese banks. Window guidance discouraging lending in Japan for real
estate investments has increased borrowing from offshore for this
purpose. Efforts preventing domestic interbank rates from rising as
rapidly as Euroyen rates have stimulated deposit growth offshore, and
regulations limiting direct inflows from the Japan offshore market have
encouraged round-tripping through financial centers outside Japan.
The statistical discrepancy in the U.S. international transactions
accounts was $16.5 billion in 1988, slightly smaller than 1987 (line 10).
However, this decline should not be interpreted as reflecting an
improvement in data accuracy. The wide swings from quarter to quarter

IV-14
in the discrepancy, combined with the relatively stable movement in the
current account balance, suggest that there are substantial errors and
omissions in the recording of data on capital flows. This impression is
reinforced by examination of data for January; despite the current
account deficit, data for the month (admittedly incomplete) show a net
capital outflow of over $12 billion. In addition, with increasing
frequency, those responsible for producing the capital flows data have
failed to catch large errors in the data.
Foreign Exchange Markets
After weakening considerably during February, the dollar recovered
in March; overall, the trade-weighted foreign-exchange value of the
dollar rose 0.4 percent during the intermeeting period, as shown in
Chart 1. Movements in the dollar were dominated primarily by changing
perceptions of the relative tightness of monetary policies in the United
States and abroad. The dollar declined through most of February, as
market participants were disappointed by a perceived lack of action by
the Federal Reserve in the wake of data showing larger than expected
increases in U.S. price indices. Meanwhile, another round of official
interest rate increases in Europe was anticipated. After the Federal
Reserve increased its discount rate on February 24 and foreign
authorities signaled an unwillingness to tighten further at the time,
the dollar rebounded. The dollar strengthened still further after the
release of the U.S. PPI for February. The dollar rose particularly
strongly against the mark, exceeding DM 1.87; on several occasions in

intervened to purchase marks.
Expectations of official European interest rate increases focused
on a rise in the Bundesbank's Lombard rate. Early in the period,
increases in measures of German inflation and capacity utilization were
announced, and, throughout February, the German call money rate hovered
around the 6 percent Lombard rate, occasionally exceeding it. The
3-month interbank rate increased by almost a full percentage point to a
high of 7 percent shortly after the rise in the U.S. discount rate, and
the range of interest rates in Bundesbank repurchase operations rose
steadily. However, the Bundesbank council met twice after the Federal
Reserve increased its discount rate and, in both meetings, refrained
from increasing the Lombard rate. In addition, subsequent RP
allocations were made at fixed rates, the first of which was announced
at a rate below the call money rate. Since the end of February,
3-month interest rates have retreated about 1/2 percentage point, and
the mark has weakened considerably.
Expectations of further monetary tightening in the United Kingdom
also have diminished. After signs of slowing in the British economy
began to emerge, the Bank of England avoided increasing its intervention
rates .The pound
strengthened somewhat following Chancellor Lawson's budget address which
indicated that monetary policy would not be eased and fiscal policy
would remain restrained. On balance, sterling declined about 1 percent
over the intermeeting period.

IV-17
Japanese monetary authorities also have not followed the recent
tightening in the United States. While Bank of Japan officials have
expressed some concern over possible inflationary pressures, Ministry of
Finance officials have indicated there is little likelihood of monetary
tightening. Recently, the Bank of Japan has injected liquidity to
offset fiscal year-end pressures on short-term interest rates.
With these foreign authorities showing little inclination towards
additional monetary restraint, short-term interest rate differentials
moved in favor of dollar assets during the intermeeting period. Rates
on 3-month CDs in the United States moved up about 90 basis points
compared with increases of only about 40 basis points, overall, in
comparable German rates and little change in the Japanese Gensaki rates.
The Australian dollar has fallen about 8 percent since the last
FOMC meeting, with much of the decline occurring in a two-day period.
The sudden fall coincided with news of a much larger than expected
current account deficit and statements by both the Prime Minister and
the Treasurer indicating that they favored a decline in the Australian
dollar.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic growth slackened in most of the major foreign industrial
nations in the fourth quarter of last year, but data available so far
for 1989 do not indicate further slowing. Japanese GNP grew by 3
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter after a surge of 9.1 percent in
the third quarter. In Germany, real GNP grew 1.1 percent (s.a.a.r.)
last quarter, down from the 4.5 percent growth of the third quarter.
Real GDP growth slowed considerably in France in the fourth quarter,
while it remained roughly constant in Canada and the United Kingdom. In
the early months of 1989, unemployment rates have declined further in
most of the major foreign industrial nations, while data on industrial
production, retail sales, and orders have been mixed.
Inflation abroad has stepped up in recent months. In Japan,
consumer price inflation was 1.4 percent in the year to February, up
slightly from the 1.2 percent rate at the end of last year. German
consumer prices were 2.6 percent above year-ago levels in February, well
above the 12-month inflation rate of 1.6 percent in December. While
much of the increase was accounted for by a hike in German excise taxes
in January, there is evidence that the underlying rate of inflation has
risen as well. CPI inflation on a 12-month basis has risen in all of
the other major foreign industrial countries in early 1989.
Individual country notes. In Japan, real GNP rose 3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter and domestic demand grew 3.1 percent.

IV-22
While plant and equipment spending rose a strong 24.4 percent and
residential investment was up 12.6 percent, consumption was virtually
unchanged, rising only 0.1 percent. Both exports and imports were
essentially flat in the fourth quarter, after strong increases in the
third quarter, and net exports had a neutral impact on growth.
Most indicators suggest that activity was strong early in the first
quarter of this year. Industrial production rose 0.9 percent (s.a.) in
January, to a level 2.5 percent above the fourth-quarter average.
Retail sales increased by 1.4 percent (s.a.) in January after declining
in the previous two months. The unemployment rate declined to 2.3
percent (s.a.) in December, its lowest level since 1982, and remained
unchanged in January. Capacity utilization declined slightly (s.a.) in
December, following its largest monthly increase in over 20 years in
November. New machinery orders were up sharply (s.a.) in December.
However, this increase was due entirely to a jump in orders placed by
the public sector; orders placed by both overseas customers and the
domestic private sector declined.
The 12-month increase in the consumer price index for Tokyo was 1.4
percent in February, up slightly from the end of last year. Wholesale
prices rose 0.3 percent (n.s.a.) in both January and February owing to
higher prices of oil and of other internationally traded goods as the
yen depreciated slightly. Wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent in the year
to February, the first 12-month increase since October 1987. The 12-
month growth rate of M2+CDs was 10.4 percent in February, near the

IV-23
middle of the 10 to 11 percent range for first-quarter growth forecast
by the Bank of Japan.
The trade surplus increased in January and rose further in
February. In the two months combined, the surplus was $98.4 billion
(s.a.a.r.), a higher rate than the $77.6 billion surplus for all of last
year. The current account surplus rate in January was $80.8 billion,
compared with a surplus of $79.5 for all of 1988.
Economic growth slowed in Germany in the fourth quarter, as real
GNP rose 1.1 percent (s.a.a.r.). The quarter was marked by a large
decline in net exports and a modest decline in public consumption, but
sharp increases in both inventory investment and investment in machinery
and equipment. Monthly data indicate that the slowing of growth in the
fourth quarter occurred largely in October. Industrial production
recovered in November and December, and advanced 0.6 percent (s.a.) in
the fourth quarter as a whole, led by strength in the capital goods
sector. In January, industrial production advanced by 1.5 percent.
However, the volume of new orders, which had rebounded strongly in
November and December, declined 2.5 percent in January as domestic
orders leveled off and foreign orders fell back to October's level.
Partly in response to the mild winter, the German unemployment rate
continued to decline to 7.9 percent (s.a.) in February. In the fourth
quarter, manufacturing capacity utilization attained its highest rate
since 1973, 88.7 percent, up 3.7 points from its year-ago rate.
Concern about inflation has risen in recent months. Consumer
prices increased 1.1 percent (n.s.a.) in January and 0.3 percent in

IV-24
February, to a level 2.6 percent above their year-earlier level. A
significant part of the increase in January reflected one-time increases
in excise taxes; rising import prices, due to firming oil prices and a
weak mark, accounted for most of the rest. Import prices rose 2.2
percent (n.s.a.) in January, to a level 5.9 percent above their year-
earlier level. Wholesale prices also have accelerated in recent months,
with February's 0.2 percent (n.s.a.) increase placing them 5.4 percent
above their year-earlier level. Wages moved up 6 percent (s.a.a.r.)
between the second and fourth quarters of 1988, after rising 3.6 percent
over the preceding four quarters. In January, M3 growth was 6.4 percent
(s.a.a.r., from the fourth quarter of 1988), exceeding the Bundesbank's
5 percent M3 growth target for 1989, but slower than the 6.8 percent
growth recorded in 1988.
The German trade surplus narrowed in January to $6.4 billion
(n.s.a.), while the current account surplus widened to $5.9 billion
(n.s.a.). In 1988, the trade surplus reached a record $72.8 billion.
Between 1987 and 1988, Germany's trade surplus with the United States
declined from $13.5 billion to $9.5 billion, while its surplus with
other EEC countries rose by nearly $12 billion. In 1988, the current
account surplus registered a record $48.5 billion.
In France, real GDP grew by 1.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth
quarter after expanding at a 4.5 percent rate in the previous quarter.
Consumption rose only slightly, and gross fixed capital formation
stagnated after several quarters of vigorous growth. Inventories rose
strongly, especially in the manufactured goods sector. Retail prices

IV-25
rose 0.3 percent (n.s.a.) in February, bringing the 12-month inflation
rate to 3.4 percent compared with a 3.1 percent rate in December.
On March 9, Finance Minister Beregoyoy announced further easing of
French exchange controls. Limitations on franc and foreign currency
loans to non-residents were ended and individuals were allowed to hold
bank accounts in ECUs. The only significant remaining exchange controls
restrict private individuals from opening foreign currency accounts in
France or accounts abroad. Beregovoy said these remaining limits would
be lifted by June 30, 1990, the deadline for full liberalization of EC
capital flows.
In the United Kingdom, recent data on the strength of economic
activity have been mixed. The average measure of real GDP grew only 2
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter of last year. Industrial
production fell by 0.8 percent (s.a.) in December and by 1.2 percent in
January as a result of lower oil output. The volume of retail sales was
down 2.4 percent (s.a.) in January, but then rose 2.5 percent in
February. The unemployment rate fell to 6.8 percent (s.a.) in January,
the 31st consecutive monthly decline and an eight-year low.
The 12-month rate of retail price inflation rose to 7.5 percent in
January, more than double the 3.3 percent rate recorded in January of
last year. Excluding mortgage interest payments, the rate was 5.6
percent. Wholesale prices increased by 5.2 percent in the 12 months to
February. The underlying 12-month rate of increase of average earnings
rose to 9 percent in January.

IV-26
U.K. trade and current account deficits, after declining in recent
months, increased to their third-highest levels ever in January. In
1988 as a whole, the current account deficit was a record $26.1 billion,
surpassing by far the $5.1 billion deficit of the previous year.
The British budget, released on March 14, contained no significant
policy initiatives. Major tax rates were not reduced despite the record
budget surplus projected for the current fiscal year. The target for
growth of MO was kept at its 1 to 5 percent range for 1989. In 1988, M0
growth exceeded this range by more than 2 percentage points. The
government expressed confidence that its policy of maintaining high
short-term interest rates would soon slow spending and reduce inflation.
Canadian real GDP rose 2.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth
quarter, down from 3.4 percent in the third quarter. Consumer spending
increased 6.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) and business investment in fixed
capital increased 8.4 percent while external demand dropped sharply. A
substantial positive swing in the rate of inventory accumulation also
contributed to growth. Industrial production increased 0.6 percent
(s.a.) in December while retail sales surged 1.9 percent (s.a.).
Canada's unemployment rate remained at 7.6 percent (s.a.) in February,
the same as in January and December, but slightly below the average rate
of 7.8 percent in 1988. Inflation has edged up recently. Consumer
prices increased 0.7 percent (s.a.) in February to a level 4.6 percent
above that of a year ago.
In Italy, growth was strong in 1988. Third-quarter GDP grew 6.3
percent (s.a.a.r.), resulting in a cumulative rise of 5 percent during

IV-27
the first three quarters of 1988. The pace of activity appears to have
been sustained in the fourth quarter; in December, industrial production
was 10.9 percent above its year-earlier level. Recent price increases
have heightened concerns about inflation. In February, 12-month
consumer price inflation was 6.3 percent, compared with a rate of 5.5
percent in December. About half of this increase reflects higher value
added taxes.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Treasury Secretary Brady, in a March 10 speech, suggested some
possible modifications of the debt strategy. His ideas represent an
evolution of the Baker Initiative, and include such innovations as
generalized waivers of sharing and negative pledge clauses in
international loan contracts and voluntary debt reduction operations
implemented through negotiations between commercial banks and debtor
countries and supported by international financial institutions.
Venezuela's new president introduced a far-reaching economic program in
February. In mid-March, the U.S. Treasury disbursed to Venezuela a $450
million short-term loan bridged to a first credit tranche purchase from
the IMF. Mexican authorities are preparing for debt negotiations with
commercial banks in which they will request debt reduction, coupled with
new money and a restructuring of principal payments. Wage and price
controls introduced in January have slowed Brazil's inflation rate. In
Argentina, a surge in the demand for dollars in February led the
government to float the exchange rate for financial transactions. In
early March, the World Bank announced that it was discontinuing

IV-28
disbursements on two sector loans to Argentina. The Philippines reached
agreement with an IMF mission this month on a three-year economic
program totaling $1.2 billion.
Individual country notes. On February 16, Venezuela's new
president Carlos Andres Perez announced a far-reaching economic
adjustment program. The program is designed to reduce the current
account deficit, encourage capital repatriation and domestic saving,
rationalize public and private sector prices, and cut the fiscal
deficit. Measures already implemented include: a unified and floating
exchange rate (representing an average devaluation of about 60 percent),
liberalized domestic interest rates, a public sector hiring freeze, a
30 percent increase in public sector wages, a 54 percent rise in the
minimum wage to compensate partially for past inflation, decontrol of
private sector prices except for a basket of about two dozen basic
consumer goods, and hikes in fuel prices averaging 85 percent. Higher
gasoline prices and bus fares sparked widespread rioting at the end of
February that left more than 250 dead.
The government has indicated its commitment to continued economic
adjustment. Measures to be implemented in the future include: tariff
and tax reform, privatization of some public enterprises, and further
increases in public sector prices.
Venezuela is seeking substantial financing in support of this
program from the IMF and the IBRD. It has requested a first credit
tranche purchase of $453 million from the IMF, expected to be approved
by the IMF Executive Board on March 29, to be followed by a three-year

IV-29
program supported by the IMF. In mid-March, the U.S. Treasury disbursed
a $450 million loan bridged to the drawing of the first credit tranche.
The government has asked for $600 million in interim financing from
commercial banks, which is unlikely to be forthcoming, and plans to
request new money and a new rescheduling of its bank debt.
The Mexican authorities are preparing for debt negotiations with
commercial banks in which they will ask for a reduction in principal
and/or interest rates, coupled with new money and/or a restructuring of
principal payments due soon. Their aim is to reduce scheduled debt
service and to reach a multi-year financing arrangement that would
obviate the need for annual negotiations and facilitate longer-range
financial planning.
The CPI rose by 2.4 percent in January and by 1.4 percent in
February. Larger increases had been anticipated in the wake of the
January 1 increase in many administered prices and in minimum wages. In
February, the CPI was 26 percent higher than a year earlier.
In 1988, imports were 55 percent higher than in 1987, reflecting
the trade liberalization measures put into effect at the end of 1987 and
the real appreciation of the peso during the year. Over the same
period, oil exports were 22 percent lower, but non-oil exports were 19
percent higher. The trade surplus, including in-bond industries, fell
to $4 billion in 1988 from $10 billion in 1987. A $3 billion current
account deficit was recorded in 1988, after a surplus of nearly $4
billion in 1987.

IV-30
In February and early March, interest rates in Mexico continued to
ease. At the March 14 auction, the 28-day Treasury bill rate was 47
percent, compared with the recent peak of 52 percent in late-December
1988.
Brazil's Summer Plan measures, introduced on January 15, were
effective in reducing measured consumer price inflation from 35.5
percent in January to 3.6 percent in February. However, this decline is
mainly due to the imposition of wage and price controls. It is not yet
clear how effective the plan has been in reducing the underlying rate of
inflation. President Sarney has not been able to move forward to any
significant degree with promised reductions in the public sector work
force or privatization of state enterprises.
The Brazilian Congress passed legislation March 20 concerning the
credit portion of the government's central budget, about 20 percent of
the overall budget, that restores most of the expenditures that had been
vetoed by President Sarney in a previous version of the budget. Sarney
signed the legislation as part of a budget compromise. Legislation
concerning the remaining 80 percent of the budget should be addressed in
upcoming weeks.
In mid-March, the Brazilian Congress authorized the executive
branch to pay $200 million in arrears to external bank creditors. This
payment, along with a $450 million interest payment to banks that was
originally scheduled for March 15, should be completed soon. Commercial
banks have signed waivers of covenants that will allow disbursement of
$600 million in new money from the 1988 financing agreement. These

IV-31
funds were originally conditional on disbursement from the $500 million
World Bank Power Sector II loan that is now unlikely to go forward. Up
to $1 billion in environmental and power sector project loans are being
considered in part to replace this loan. An IMF mission will visit
Brazil in early April mainly to analyze the prospects for fiscal
adjustment in 1989.
In Argentina, a surge in the demand for dollars at the beginning of
February led the government to fix the exchange rate for imports and
cease to intervene in the market for foreign exchange used for financial
transactions; the exchange rate applicable to most exports has remained
fixed by the authorities. Since then, the free market rate used for
financial transactions has depreciated by more than 100 percent. The
exchange rate has stabilized somewhat in recent weeks, in part due to
the resumption of some intervention. As a result of reduced demand for
austral-denominated assets and tight monetary policy, calculated real
interest rates on short-term instruments now exceed 10 percent per
month.
Inflation rose from 6.8 percent on a monthly basis in December 1988
to 8.9 percent in January 1989 and 9.6 percent in February. At the end
of February, key business groups withdrew support from the voluntary
price guidelines that had helped reduce inflation from last August's
peak levels. March inflation is projected at 15 percent.
On March 2, the World Bank announced it was discontinuing
disbursements on its trade and banking sector loans approved last
October due to Argentina's failure to achieve sufficient progress in

IV-32
implementing macroeconomic reforms. Half of the $300 million trade
sector loan has already been disbursed, while the $400 million banking
sector loan never became effective.
The Philippines reached agreement with an IMF mission on March 8 on
a new three-year IMF economic program totaling $1.2 billion. Of this
amount, $870 million would be provided from the Extended Fund Facility
and $375 million from the Compensatory and Contingency Financing
Facility. A signed letter of intent has been sent to the Fund and its
Executive Board is likely to consider the program in early May.
Philippine officials are likely to request new loans from commercial
banks in early April.
The impact of the interruption in fruit exports from Chile on its
overall trade balance is not expected to be severe.
