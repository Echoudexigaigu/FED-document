Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Indications of slower economic growth have continued to accumulate in
the period since the May FOMC meeting, with the production and spending data
painting a fairly consistent picture of softness in housing, motor vehicles,
and other consumer goods. Business fixed investment has been strong so far
this year, but recent data on orders indicate that some deceleration is
likely. Inflation remained rapid through May, paced by large price
increases in the food and energy areas.
Labor Market Developments
Growth in demand for labor slackened during the spring; the unemploy-
ment rate continues to be low, however, suggesting that pressures on labor
supplies have yet to ease.
In the payroll survey, increases in employment have been below the
rapid pace of the previous two years in every month since February, and the
May rise of 100,000 was the smallest in some time. Manufacturing
employment, which had turned down in April, slipped further in May, with
small declines in several industries. Construction employment also fell in
May and, like manufacturing, has changed little on net since January. In
the service-producing sector, the growth of jobs in May was relatively slow
by recent standards, as increases in trade and business services were small.
Both the average workweek and the aggregate hours of production and
nonsupervisory workers fell in May, reversing April increases that
undoubtedly had been exaggerated by seasonal adjustment problems associated
with an unusually early Easter holiday. Nevertheless, the factory workweek,
at 41 hours, remained high by historical standards.

After moving down fairly steadily from early 1987 through the end of
1988, the civilian unemployment rate has fluctuated narrowly in a range of
5.0 to 5.3 percent over the past four months, with the May reading at
5.2 percent. Even so, the 5-1/4 percent jobless rate of recent months is
lower than that observed in any period since 1973-74. Other indicators also
have pointed in the direction of labor market tautness: for example, the
number of involuntary part-time workers and the number of job losers
continued to trend down in May. Moreover, the level of initial claims edged
up only a little through mid-June, suggesting that layoffs have continued to
be limited.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
The monthly changes in industrial production have been a bit erratic
this year. On average, however, the data of recent months--while still
preliminary--seem to be pointing toward growth in the range of 2 percent at
an annual rate in both the first and second quarters of this year, down from
the 5 to 6 percent pace of the two previous years.
By and large, the composition of growth in industrial production in
recent months has mirrored the patterns of change in final demand. In May,
the output of construction supplies was down 0.8 percent--the fourth month
of decline. Auto assemblies, which had turned up temporarily in April, fell
300,000 units in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.1 million
units (FRB seasonals); a further decline is likely in June, as the assembly
rate through the first three weeks of the month was 6.8 million units at an
annual rate. The production of light trucks fell nearly 4 percent in May,
and current schedules indicate that production will be flat in June. Output
of consumer goods other than motor vehicles was down 0.2 percent in May and

has changed little since January, a period in which consumer outlays for
goods also have been relatively sluggish.
The output of business equipment excluding motor vehicles, which rose
at an annual rate of 11 percent in the first quarter, continued to exhibit
strong growth into the second quarter, with gains of 0.5 percent in both
April and May. Although a significant portion of the advance this year has
reflected a surge in the output of computers, gains in production of a
variety of other types of equipment, particularly capital goods for
manufacturing industries, also have been quite strong.
On balance, production of materials has been nearly flat since late
last year, after advancing briskly earlier. Part of this weakness stems
from a decline in the output of parts for consumer durable goods, a
development related to the weakness in motor vehicle assemblies. In
addition, manufacturers began to reduce their inventories of materials and
supplies late last year, and this trend continued in the first quarter.
This reduction followed sizable buildups earlier in 1988, when rapid demand
growth, reports of short supplies, and the anticipation of rising prices
were encouraging producers to build stocks.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and utilities has
slipped since January. The rate for the advanced processing industries has
been essentially flat since the start of the year. However, utilization at
primary processing industries, which by late last year had risen close to
the 1978-80 peak, has since turned down; the May figure, at 86.3 percent,
was nearly 2 percentage points below the level of last November. This
softening in the primary processing industries has coincided with lower

inflation in materials prices. The producer price index for intermediate
materials excluding food and energy has risen at an annual rate of
4-1/2 percent over the last six months and at only a 2-1/2 percent rate over
the last three months--a noticeable slowdown from the 6 to 7 percent rate of
increase of the previous two years (chart).
Personal Income and Consumption
A weakening in consumer spending has contributed notably to the
economic deceleration this year. Real consumption spending grew only about
1-1/2 percent, at an annual rate, in the first quarter, and given the data
currently available--which still are preliminary and subject to substantial
revision--growth seems to have been similarly sluggish in the second
quarter.
The causes of this slowdown are not entirely clear. Although real
disposable income has softened very recently, growth on net in the first
half of this year has been reasonably strong. In addition, stock market
gains of recent months have added appreciably to the wealth of households.
And, while higher interest rates may have provided some incentives to defer
spending for durables, it is somewhat curious that much of the recent
softness actually has been in the nondurables area. Consumer surveys taken
before the recent drop in interest rates suggested that, while sentiment
remained favorable on the whole, there were some concerns about economic
prospects, perhaps related to high interest rates and the bad news on
inflation.
In May, real disposable personal income jumped 0.8 percent, reversing
much of a steep April decline. In large part, the April-May swing reflected
the influence of nonwithheld tax payments, which have been sizable so far

this year, especially in April. Growth in wages and salaries remained
sluggish in May; in real terms, they were no higher than the first-quarter
average. Among nonwage components of income, growth of personal interest
income slowed a bit in April and May. Farm proprietors' income moved down
in May for a third month and is back to a more normal range; farm income had
soared in February when federal payments for drought assistance surged.
Real personal consumption expenditures declined 0.3 percent in May, led
by a reduction in outlays for motor vehicles. In addition, spending on
other goods moved down in real terms for the third consecutive month. On
net, real PCE in May was essentially unchanged from the December 1988 level
(chart). Growth in outlays for services was maintained over this period,
with the second quarter getting a boost from a weather-related swing in
outlays for residential service fuels. In contrast, spending on both motor
vehicles and other goods declined, on net, over the first five months of the
year. Spending has been especially weak for gasoline, apparel, and food and
for durables such as jewelry and recreational goods; outlays for furniture
and household equipment, however, have held up well.
Autos and Trucks
Sales of domestically produced cars averaged 70 million units at an
annual rate during the first 20 days of June--a bit less than in May. Sales
have been lackluster in recent months despite ongoing incentive programs
1. The BEA has revised up sharply its estimates of personal tax and
nontax payments for the first quarter (by $17-1/2 billion at an annual
rate) and for April (a $44 billion upward revision, at an annual rate).
The revisions were based on the additional information about actual
payments through May. The new estimates incorporate a higher and
smoother path for the "normal" growth in these taxes. In addition, the
April figure included "transitory" tax payments of $36 billion at an
annual rate.

that are quite generous by historical standards. The most likely
explanation of these developments is that the underlying demand for autos
has weakened this year. However, it also is possible that consumers have
been anticipating extensions--or perhaps expansions--of the existing
programs and have delayed purchases until closer to the end of the model
year.
Dealers' inventories at the end of May remained on the high side,
little changed from their month-earlier level. The 1.7 million units on
dealers' lots equalled roughly 72 days of supply at the May level of sales.
In addition to some chronically slow movers such as Chrysler's E-Class cars
and GM's luxury "personal" cars, the current inventory problem is acute for
many subcompacts, including the Escort/Lynx made by Ford and the Geo

II-13
Prism/Nova jointly produced by General Motors and Toyota. With little time
remaining before model changeover is in full swing, the domestic automakers
cannot eliminate these inventory excesses via cuts in production of 1989-
2model cars. Instead, the current round of incentives likely will be
extended through the end of the model year and probably will be sweetened a
bit to clear the showroom floors for the arrival of 1990-model cars.
Sales of imported cars declined in May to a 2.8 million unit annual
rate, following April's robust pace of 3.3 million units. Inventories of
foreign-made cars also are at relatively high levels by historical
standards. As one indicator of the current oversupply of foreign
nameplates, this model year has seen the introduction, for the first time,
of dealer incentives on Hondas.
Business Fixed Investment
Business equipment spending has been strong so far this year.
Shipments of equipment excluding aircraft (aggregated with PDE weights) were
little changed in May, but because of a strong advance in April, the
April-May average was 2-3/4 percent above the first-quarter level and
suggests that the second-quarter growth will be well-maintained. When one
looks beyond the current quarter, however, the data on new orders suggest a
slowing in the growth of equipment outlays. The orders for equipment other
than aircraft dropped 3-1/4 percent in May after a substantial April gain;
the April-May average was slightly above the first-quarter level.
Total real spending for nonresidential structures has been relatively
flat in recent quarters. Among the latest developments, industrial

construction put in place has begun to show a mild uptrend; however, many
other categories, including non-office commercial and institutional
building, have changed little on balance from levels attained during 1988.
The outlook for nonresidential structures remains weak. The Dodge data
on the total value of new construction contracts have been trending down,
especially for the commercial and institutional sectors. Indicators of
current-quarter investment in oil and gas drilling are mixed despite the
surge in crude oil prices this year. The average number of drilling rigs
used in April and May is 16-1/2 percent above the first-quarter level, but
the total footage drilled declined in April, according to preliminary
estimates. The BEA uses the data both on rigs and on footage drilled in its
estimate of the oil-drilling component of expenditures for nonresidential
construction.
The latest Commerce Department and McGraw-Hill surveys of planned
capital spending, taken in April and May, indicate that firms expect to
increase nominal outlays 10 percent or so this year. These survey results,
however, imply a spending trajectory that seems somewhat high, given other
recent indicators of investment spending. The average absolute error of the
Commerce Department survey in projecting year-over-year spending on plant
and equipment is 1.4 percentage points, whereas that of the McGraw-Hill
survey is 1.9 percentage points.
Business Inventories
Inventory investment remained moderate early in the second quarter; but
even so, reports of concern about possible overstocking--for example, some
accounts in the "Beige Book"--seem more numerous of late. In terms of 1982
dollars, the inventories in all manufacturing and trade rose $21.4 billion

at an annual rate in April, only slightly above the pace of the first
quarter. Excluding auto dealers, real inventories edged up in April, after
two months of small declines.
Manufacturers' inventory investment through April was concentrated in
aircraft and other capital goods industries, where market demand had
remained firm. By stage of fabrication, increases in work-in-process
stocks, especially in the aircraft industry, continued to dominate factory
inventory movements in recent months; materials inventories declined
somewhat in the first four months of this year, and stocks of finished goods
were little changed on net. The inventory-to-shipments ratio for
manufacturing in April was about the same as the average observed over the
past year.
In the trade sector, auto dealers' stocks still are on the high side.
Elsewhere, the picture is somewhat ambiguous. Among those retail
establishments that carry mostly discretionary consumption goods (general
merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliances), the current-cost
inventory-sales ratio fell back in April as sales of these items advanced
sharply. However, the constant-dollar data for April show the
inventory-sales ratio rising further from an already high level. All told,
it appears that some overhang of stocks may be present in retail lines other
than autos, but at the same time they probably are not widespread or severe.
As noted above, the domestic production of nondurable consumer goods
(largely clothing and consumer staples carried by general merchandisers,
specialty stores, and variety stores) has been flat since January,
suggesting that producers have moved quickly to adjust production in the
face of weakening sales. In addition, imports of nonauto consumer goods in

II-19
the first quarter dropped considerably from the fourth quarter level and
appear to have remained flat in April.
In the wholesale trade sector, drawdowns of stocks of unprocessed farm
products continued through April, but inventory changes elsewhere have been
moderate since January. Overall, the inventory-sales ratio for all
wholesalers has trended down since late last year.
Housing Markets
Mortgage interest rates have dropped sharply since the May FOMC
meeting, but most of the available housing data still reflect the previous
runup in rates. Anecdotal reports and surveys of attitudes remained
predominantly negative in tone into June.
Total private housing starts fell 2 percent in May to an annual rate of
1.31 million units, as single-family starts dropped back to the March low.
Multifamily construction in May was little changed from the seven-year low
recorded in April. Total issuance of building permits also was about
unchanged last month, as a decrease in single-family permits offset a rise
in permit issuance for multifamily housing construction. So far in 1989,
total starts are down 3 percent from the average for all of 1988; total
permits are off by nearly 7 percent.
In the single-family sector, the annual rate of starts averaged about
1 million units from March to May, down about 8 percent from the average
pace during 1988; permits for new construction and sales of new and existing
homes also have been running below the 1988 average. Interest rates on
conventional fixed-rate mortgages remained close to their springtime peak of
11 percent through the first half of May, well above the 1988 average of 10-
1/4 percent. In addition, over the period from March to mid-May, the

initial interest rate on adjustable-rate mortgages rose to the highest level
since late 1985. High initial rates diminish purchases of homes by buyers
who typically use ARMs, including those who anticipate a relatively short
period of residence in a new home and those who may not meet qualifications
for fixed-rate mortgages.
Preliminary survey results suggest that, as of the end of the third
week of June, consumer attitudes toward homebuying had not changed
significantly in response to the recent drop in interest rates. Possibly,
consumers' expectations of a further drop in rates explain this apparent
lack of response. Similarly builders' expectations for single-family starts
changed little in June.
In the multifamily sector, starts still are being limited by the
adverse effects of 1986 tax law changes and by a persistent substantial
oversupply of multifamily units, especially for higher-rent units in which
builders have increasingly concentrated since tax reform took effect. Even
so, the figures on multifamily starts for April and May were surprisingly
low, and an upturn seems likely. In this regard, permits for multifamily
construction jumped 12 percent in May to 424 thousand units, well above the
average level for the first quarter of 1989; ordinarily, the permits series
is less subject than starts to statistical error and may thus be a better
indication of the underlying trends.
Federal Government
According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, federal spending recovered
somewhat in May from an unexpectedly low April figure, and receipts fell
back after the April surge in personal tax payments. Consequently, the

total budget position returned to deficit, amounting to $25.5 billion for
the month.
Cutting through the monthly swings, it appears that, on a budget basis,
non-CCC federal spending in the second quarter of this year will be about
unchanged from the fourth quarter of last year; these outlays had grown at a
9 percent annual rate in the second half of 1988 (chart), owing in part to a
bulge in FSLIC outlays around year-end. Nominal outlays for defense seem to
have subsided from a fourth-quarter spike, probably implying a decline in
real NIPA defense purchases as well. However, social security and medicare
benefits (the dominant elements in federal transfer payments) have continued
to grow, and the seasonal drop in interest payments in the second quarter of
1989 looks smaller than those of past years.
On the income side of the accounts, total receipts for April and May
together were $31 billion, or 18-1/2 percent above a year earlier. For
reasons that are not altogether clear, nonwithheld personal tax receipts for
this period rose especially rapidly and were 27 percent above a year
earlier. Daily tax receipts data for June, when the second estimated
personal tax payment for 1989 was due, suggest growth in nonwithheld taxes
of a bit less than 7 percent relative to June of last year. In contrast,
the daily data suggest a decline in corporate profits taxes from a year ago,
as corporate profits have weakened recently.
In view of the moderation in the growth of outlays for fiscal year 1989
and the favorable receipts developments in April and May, most forecasters
of the budget deficit for the fiscal year as a whole are revising their
projections downward. New official projections will not become available
from the Administration and the Congressional Budget Office until mid-July

and August, respectively. It now appears likely, however, that both
agencies will revise their estimates to show a deficit somewhat below $155
billion for fiscal year 1988, down from their previous respective estimates
of $164 billion and $159 billion.
State and Local Governments
Growth in real purchases of goods and services by state and local
governments has been moderate, on balance, this year. In April, the first-
quarter weakness in construction spending was reversed, with the level
returning to its fourth-quarter average (table). One of the largest gains
over this period was in spending on "other buildings," which includes
correctional facilities, a high budget priority for many state and local
governments in recent years.
Employment by state and local governments increased 75,000, about
3 percent at an annual rate, over the first two months of the second
quarter. This increase extends the uptrend of the past five years (chart).
On average since 1985, state and local employment increased around 300,000
per year, after declining somewhat during the early part of the decade. In
each of the past five years, approximately half of the increase was among
educational personnel employed by local governments. Also, fairly steady
gains at both levels of government were registered among general
administrative employees, which include police and firemen, as well as
office workers.
The fiscal situation has placed many state and local governments under
some stress; the operating and capital account deficit (excluding social
insurance funds) was over $17 billion in the first quarter. However, as at
the federal level, some improvement may have occurred during the second

quarter; most states appear to have collected higher-than-expected income
tax receipts. For example, in California, collections for fiscal year 1989
came in about $1 billion higher than expected. Generally, states have
attributed such increases, at least in part, to higher-than-expected 1988
personal income, as well as to higher capital gains.
Agricultural Production
With the 1989 agricultural production cycle now entering its most
critical phase, conditions still seem to be pointing toward a sizable
rebound in total farm output this year. Drought clearly has hurt the winter
wheat crop, which is likely to fall 10 percent short of last year's level,
according to the Agriculture Department's June 1 assessment of crop
conditions. However, total wheat production is expected to be up
12 percent, because of an anticipated rise in the production of spring
wheat, which had been almost wiped out by drought in the Upper Midwest in
1988. The USDA also is projecting higher output of soybeans, corn, and most
other grains. If the current production projections are borne out, then the
constant-dollar output of the major crops (wheat, feed grains, and soybeans)
should be up about $11 billion in 1989, more than reversing last year's
decline (table).
Qualitative reports of crop conditions (table) indicate that the
condition of the spring-planted crops remained fairly stable through the
month of June, in contrast to the massive deterioration that already was
3. These calculations, which are based on year-to-year changes in
actual production, differ conceptually from the BEA's estimates of
drought losses, which were computed by comparing actual production in
1988 to what likely would have occurred in that same year in the absence
of drought.

evident at this time last year. Conditions for spring wheat, in particular,
look to be on track for a big rebound from last year's very poor harvest.
In the livestock area, the Agriculture Department has revised up
further its projection of total meat and poultry production for 1989, which
now is expected to be about 1 percent above that of 1988. Since December,
the forecast for 1989 has been revised up about 2 percentage points, mainly
because of a smaller-than-expected decline in the production of beef, a
sector in which liquidations of some cattle in regions still afflicted by
drought appear to have added to the normal flow of marketings. Looking
ahead, the USDA projections point to moderate declines in the output of both
beef and pork over the second half of 1989. However, the output of poultry
is expected to grow rapidly in the second half, rising to a level about
6 percent above a year earlier. All told, the USDA figures suggest that
total meat and poultry production should hold fairly steady over the
remainder of the year (chart), closing out a decade in which the trend in
the output of these items has been reasonably stable relative to the
turbulence of the 1970s.4
4. Thus far in 1989 the strongest price pressures in agriculture have
come not from the major crop and livestock commodities, but rather from
items such as eggs and fresh vegetables, which have been affected by
adverse supply developments. Egg producers had started to curtail
production early in 1988 in response to poor profitability, and with the
drought boosting feed costs, that curtailment has lasted longer and cut
deeper than otherwise would have been the case; however, prices have
been above the break-even point this year, and the USDA's projections
show production rising moderately over the balance of 1989.
The lingering effects of the 1988 drought also have affected the
prices of some fresh vegetables that are on an annual production cycle.
For example, potato stocks were low coming into 1989, and price
increases have been sizable this year. In addition, prices recently
have been strong for a number of vegetables that have shorter production
(Footnote continues on next page)

Prices
Aggregate price increases continued to be large in April and May,
extending the surge of the first quarter. So far this year, both the PPI
and the CPI have risen substantially faster than they did in 1988; indeed,
this year's increases in the two indexes have been running well above those
of any year since the early 1980s.
However, the underlying inflation situation clearly has not
deteriorated as much as the overall price numbers have. A substantial part
of the price surge has been concentrated among energy and food items and
reflects supply influences that seem likely to be transitory. Excluding
food and energy, the rate of increase in consumer prices so far this year
has differed little from last year's pace, owing partly to the dollar's
effect in damping import prices. Even so, the underlying tendency of
inflation--as reflected in inflation expectations, increases in
compensation, and the price numbers excluding food and energy--seems to be
centering on the 4-1/2 to 5 percent mark at present, up a notch from the
norm that prevailed during the first several years of the expansion.
Among the recent developments, consumer energy prices climbed about
5 percent in April and 1-1/2 percent in May, mainly reflecting hikes for
gasoline. Prices of the latter have risen more than 20 percent (not at an
annual rate) since last December. However, posted prices for West Texas
(Footnote continued from previous page)
cycles (notably tomatoes). Acreage of these crops apparently rose
substantially in the second quarter, but weather may either have hurt
yields or caused delays in harvesting. In any event, wholesale prices
for a number of fresh vegetables still were high as of mid-June, and
pressures at the retail level may therefore persist in that month's CPI.

Intermediate crude oil have come down a bit since May. Retail gasoline
prices in the summer are likely to reflect both crude oil costs and the
effect of stricter environmental standards for gasoline.
The CPI for food rose about half a percent per month in April and May.
Prices in the meat and poultry grouping were up similarly, but these
increases were well above those posted in the first quarter. In May, the
index was boosted by a hike in the prices of fresh vegetables, particularly
tomatoes (up 30 percent). Such increases typically are transitory and tend
to be reversed as new crops become available. Excluding both the livestock
and produce-based components, retail food prices (70 percent of total food)
slowed appreciably in May relative to the rapid pace observed over much of
the past year.
Apart from food and energy, the CPI for commodities rose 0.2 percent in
April and 0.4 percent in May. Over these two months, prices were down a bit
for housefurnishings and motor vehicles but up sharply for pharmaceuticals
and household paper products. Apparel prices also have risen markedly since
March but remained, nonetheless, only 3-1/4 percent above their levels of a
year earlier. Over the first five months of the year, the CPI for
commodities (nonfood, nonenergy) has risen at an average annual rate of
nearly 4 percent, a bit below the pace in 1988.
A slowing in non-oil import prices this year may have helped to hold
down the retail prices of a broad range of consumer goods. For example,
among those consumer goods that the BLS has identified as having higher than
average import proportions, price increases over the past six months have
generally been smaller than those of similar periods in 1987 and 1988.

II-33
Prices of nonenergy services rose only 0.2 percent in April but were up
0.5 percent in May. The April index was held down by a sharp drop for
lodging out of town (a late ski season in the West had boosted the March
figure), while the May CPI included a large increase for owners' equivalent
rent. Over the past twelve months, the CPI for nonenergy services has risen
5.1 percent, nearly 1/2 percentage point more than in the preceding year
(table). Almost half of this pickup is attributable to increases in auto
finance charges, which, according to the BLS, reflect higher loan rates at

commercial banks over this period. Among the other components of nonenergy
services, the acceleration has been most pronounced for the more "labor-
related" services. Particularly large increases were registered over-the-
year for public transportation services (mainly airfares), medical services,
and a variety of other components. On balance, these increases are broadly
consistent with the 1-3/4 percentage points acceleration in ECI compensation
for the service-producing sector.
At earlier stages of processing, prices of intermediate materials (less
food and energy) rose only 0.2 percent in May, after leveling off in April.
Both increases and declines were fairly widespread in the past two months,
with declines most notable in the nonferrous metals categories. Prices of
crude nonfood materials less energy dropped back in April and May, in large
part reflecting declines for nonferrous ores and scrap. Since the week of
the May FOMC meeting, prices in spot commodity markets have declined for
most foods and for nonferrous metals but have been mixed for other
industrial materials.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wage information for the second quarter is limited to the data on
average hourly earnings, which, as of May, were up 3-3/4 percent from a year
earlier. After accelerating from late 1986 through mid-1988, the year-to-
year rise in this measure shows a fairly flat trend over the past several
months, and although the series covers only production and nonsupervisory
workers, the second-quarter data suggest that any acceleration in the
broader wage measures may turn out to be fairly limited.
As reported in the previous Greenbook, the employment cost index,
which is available only through March, has shown some easing of wage trends

in the goods-producing industries, an area where the coverage of the ECI is
most similar to that of hourly earnings. However, in the service-producing
sector--where the ECI's coverage is much broader than that of hourly
earnings--the trend of recent quarters has been sharply upward, by enough to
keep the overall ECI wage trend on a moderate upward course. Benefit costs
in the ECI were up slightly faster than wages over the twelve months ended
in March, and total compensation was up 4.6 percent over that period.
Geographically, by far the biggest rise in labor costs over the year ended
in March occurred in the Northeast (chart), an area with an exceptionally
low unemployment rate. In contrast to the Northeast, rates of labor cost
inflation in other areas of the country appear to have leveled off or fallen
slightly.
Other data still hint at the potential for some additional acceleration
in wages in the months ahead. As noted earlier, the unemployment rate is
low by postwar standards. In addition, inflation expectations have been
holding at the 5 percent mark or better for some time now, noticeably higher
than they were before mid-1988. Also, some indicators of labor market
conditions still look strong--perhaps surprisingly so in view of the
softening evident in the monthly labor market surveys. In particular, the
Conference Board index of help-wanted advertising has climbed steadily since
January of this year, and several independent employer surveys, including
the Bureau of National Affairs, the Conference Board, and Manpower Inc.,
report continued strong hiring prospects for the third quarter.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have declined considerably since the May 16 meeting of
the FOMC--by about a quarter percentage point in the short-term money market
to three-quarters of a point at the long end of the maturity spectrum. An
easing in the federal funds rate to around 9-1/2 percent supported this
rally, but the major boost has been supplied by a series of data releases
confirming a slowing in economic growth and by an influx of international
capital reportedly bolstered by concerns about events in China. At this
juncture, the markets appear to be much imbued with the idea that the
economy is on track toward a "soft landing" and that, with risks of greater
inflation thus averted, the System will be taking further easing actions in
the next few months.
A spate of articles stimulated by the publication of a staff paper on
the P model may have caused market participants to focus a little more
attention on the sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates. Owing to a
substantial runoff of deposits in the first half of May when an unusually
large volume of checks for April tax payments cleared, all the monetary
aggregates registered declines for the month; M2 fell to the lower end of
its "parallel band," while M3 placed just below its annual growth cone.
Weekly data, however, give evidence of a rebound in the broader aggregates
in late May and extending into June, with impetus coming from the decline
in market rates relative to deposit rates as well as a replenishing of
tax-depleted holdings.
While greater-than-anticipated second-quarter tax revenues have reduced
Treasury borrowing, credit use by other sectors may have picked up recently.
III-1

III-2
Commercial bank lending in May matched its brisk first-quarter rate and bond
issuance burgeoned of late, as corporate and municipal financial officers
sought to take advantage of the declines in long-term yields. Household
indebtedness likely has grown at a moderate pace, given sluggish consumer
spending and weak housing activity.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
In May, weakness in liquid deposits showed through to the broader
aggregates, and M2 and M3 declined at annual rates of 3-1/4 and 3/4 percent
respectively. Data through mid-June point to a rebound in these measures of
money. Ml, however, is not turning up, although its rate of decline appears
to have slowed.
Payments for nonwithheld taxes were unexpectedly large this year,
depressing holdings of liquid balances at the end of April and into May as
those payments were processed. Other checkable deposits (OCDs), the main
personal payment medium, fell 30 percent at an annual rate in May after
having declined 2-1/2 percent in April. The drop in OCDs, along with a
plunge in demand deposits at a 14 percent rate and the second consecutive
month of sluggish currency growth, pulled M1 down 15 percent at an annual
rate in May.
The nontransactions component of M2 was essentially flat for the month
of May, as tax payments apparently contributed to unusual weakness in liquid
instruments that were drawn down to meet tax obligations directly or through
transfer to M1 accounts. Money market funds registered their first monthly
decrease in almost a year, and savings deposits and MMDAs declined at 23 and
36 percent annual rates respectively. As has been the case for some months,
small time deposits were the only component of M2 to register strong growth.

Earlier in the year, rising market interest rates had buoyed the growth of
small time deposits at the expense of more liquid deposits while rates on
these latter accounts adjusted only sluggishly to market movements. Now,
however, given that market rates have fallen, the opportunity costs of
holding most types of M2 balances have dropped. As households respond to
falling opportunity costs and rebuild their liquid balances, M2 has begun to
recover from its mid-May lows, as can be seen in recent weekly data (chart).
The outflows of core deposits in May were offset by inflows of Treasury
deposits, a non-M3 source of funds. Banks were thus able to reduce their
reliance on large time deposits, which slowed to a 9 percent rate of growth
from the double-digit rates of the preceding months, and turned instead to
non-M3 borrowings, such as federal funds from nonbank institutions, as well
as Treasury tax and loan balances. Offsetting some of this weakening,
institution-only money market funds, which were not affected by the swings
related to individual tax payments, enjoyed strong inflows in May. Like M2,
weekly data suggest a rebound in M3 growth, returning this aggregate to the
lower bound of its annual range (chart).
Bank credit grew at a 7-3/4 percent annual rate in May, about its pace
in the first quarter but 5 percentage points above April's growth. Holdings
of U.S. government securities expanded more rapidly, and the runoff of other
securities decelerated. Real estate loan growth remained in double digits,
and consumer loans grew at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate in May, about their
growth in 1988. Business loan growth was up sharply in May to an 11 percent
annual rate, with little of this borrowing attributable to merger-related
financing; but preliminary data for the first part of June suggest a

deceleration, owing to the paydown of some loans associated with the RJR-
Nabisco acquisition.
Business Finance
Net borrowing by nonfinancial firms apparently strengthened in May from
its subdued April pace. The stronger growth in business loans at commercial
banks was accompanied by continued heavy issuance of commercial paper. Only
low-grade commercial paper, a small segment of the overall market, was
affected by the recent announcement that Integrated Resources Inc., a
diversified financial services firm, would not make payment on about $300
million of outstanding paper as it matures. Boosted by the RJR-Nabisco
buyout financing in early May and by falling interest rates throughout the
month, gross public bond issuance posted a sizable gain in May, which has
continued into June.
To minimize borrowing costs, recent bond offerings have increasingly
included poison put indentures to ease investors' concerns about event risk
and convertibility features to take advantage of the recent runup in equity
prices. Additionally, several financial and a few nonfinancial borrowers
have issued a large volume of bonds that include straight put options that
allow the owner unconditionally to sell the bond back to the issuer at par
after a specified date; as opposed to the poison put, the straight put
option limits investor exposure to both event and interest rate risks.
Yields on junk bonds, which increased by 20 to 30 basis points in
advance of RJR-Holdings' $5.2 billion issuance in early May, have since
fallen by about 30 basis points, a little less than the yields on
investment-grade bonds. Despite the recent drop in junk bond yields,

issuance has been light since mid-May and the calendar of prospective
offerings suggests little pickup in the near term.
Spurred by a strong dollar, falling interest rates, and brightened
prospects for a soft landing, the stock market rallied, reaching postcrash
highs. Most major stock indexes are now about 3 to 5 percent above their
levels at the last FOMC meeting. Gross equity issuance has picked up in
recent weeks but remains anemic. Owing to a slowdown in merger activity in
the current quarter, net equity retirements are projected at roughly a $125
billion rate, down from a $180 billion annual rate in the first quarter.
Net retirements, however, should rise over the second half of the year; the
calendar of proposed mergers and acquisitions has begun to build.
Municipal Securities
Issuance of long-term municipal securities is projected to total about
$10 billion in June, sharply higher than May's slow pace. The stronger June
volume reflects both a pickup in issuance of bonds for new capital and an
increase in the volume of refunding bonds, encouraged by the appreciable
drop in long-term municipal yields over the spring.
The decline in municipal yields has not fully matched that in Treasury
bond rates. The ratio of tax-exempt to Treasury yields, which fell to a
five-year low of 0.85 in May, has since risen to 0.89. Apart from the usual
greater responsiveness of Treasury rates to general changes in financial
market sentiment, the Treasury sector probably has benefited most from the
flight from foreign assets as well as from more favorable near-term supply
conditions than in the municipal sector.

Treasury and Sponsored-Agency Financing
The staff estimate of the second-quarter federal budget surplus has
been revised upward, to $20.5 billion, and its distribution among months
shifted as the dimensions of the surge in tax receipts in April have become
clearer. Treasury borrowing dropped sharply in the second quarter but still
remained positive on a net basis, as the Treasury used its surplus to build
up its cash balances.
In keeping with its usual practice of adjusting bill issuance to
variations in cash needs, the Treasury aggressively cut the gross sizes of
its weekly bill auctions when the large size of the tax inflows became

evident. The gross auction size was moved down in a series of steps from
$14.4 billion to $12.8 billion, resulting in an estimated $13 billion
paydown in weekly bills, after three consecutive quarters in which the
weekly auctions were needed to raise new cash. The coupon auctions continue
to raise new cash, but at a slightly reduced pace, owing to the $250 million
to $500 million cutbacks in gross auction sizes. The staff anticipates
that, absent congressional action, Treasury borrowing will begin to be
constrained in early August as outstanding debt nears the $2.8 trillion
ceiling.
In the market for securities of federally sponsored credit agencies,
borrowing by the Federal Home Loan Banks appears to have fallen off sharply
from earlier in the year owing to the drop in their advances to thrifts in
the second quarter. Public offerings of FHLB bonds in June were
$2.2 billion, the smallest total since April 1988 and down markedly from the
$6 billion average gross size over the preceding five months. Reflecting
this reduced issuance, spreads on FHLB securities over Treasuries narrowed
sharply. For example, the spread on one-year paper fell from 30 basis
points in May to 10 basis points at the June offering, while spreads on
longer maturities have fallen by less.
Thrift Institutions
The losses of thrift institutions in the first quarter of 1989 totaled
$3.4 billion, and the FHLBB revised the previous quarter's losses upward by
$900 million, to $3.2 billion.1 Although the earnings of GAAP-solvent
thrifts increased to $800 million in the first quarter of 1989, the

of the $900 million revision to the fourth-quarter figure.

III-13
industry's overall profits were pulled down by the $4.2 billion of losses
incurred by GAAP-insolvent thrifts. As a result of continuing aggregate
losses, the industry GAAP capital-to-asset ratio declined to 2.9 percent in
the first quarter of 1989 from 3.4 percent at year-end. Tangible capital,
which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, totaled only
1.4 percent of industry assets. For GAAP-solvent thrift institutions, the
tangible-capital-to-asset ratio stood at 3.3 percent, while for
GAAP-insolvent thrifts it was -15 percent.
After strong runoffs during the first quarter, total thrift deposits
increased in April. Deposit inflows were flat in May, but this apparently
reflected the overall weakness in M2 rather than any condition specific to
thrifts; thrift deposits have increased in the first half of June at a rate
in line with that of commercial banks, perhaps owing to more competitive
deposit pricing by thrift institutions. Rates on retail deposits at thrift
institutions have generally responded more sluggishly to the decline in
market rates than those at commercial banks, resulting in a widening of the
rate advantage that thrifts offer. Advances from Federal Home Loan Banks
(FHLBs) mirrored the turnaround in deposits, rising rapidly over the first
quarter and registering sizable declines thereafter. This lessened need for
funds was reinforced by an administrative change by several Federal Home
Loan Banks, including Dallas, which lowered the ceiling on advances to
member institutions as a share of their FHLB stock.
Mortgage Markets
Available data suggest that the net growth in mortgage debt outstanding
in the second quarter probably remained near the moderate first-quarter rate
of increase, a situation consistent with the recent weakness in home sales

and construction. Net acquisitions of mortgage-related assets by FSLIC-
insured institutions were down somewhat in April from the pace earlier in
the year, as a runoff in holdings of mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
partially offset increases in whole mortgage loans (table). Adjustable-rate
mortgages (ARMs) accounted for the bulk of thrift acquisitions of
unsecuritized mortgages as these institutions continued to sell off fixed-
rate mortgages (FRMs). Mortgage originations at thrifts were down sharply
in April to levels last observed in mid-1985. Real estate lending by
commercial banks, however, appears to have been maintained in recent months
at about the first-quarter pace.
FSLIC-insured institutions have continued their relatively heavy
reliance on ARMs, which have accounted for more than two-thirds of their
mortgage loan originations in recent months. Average monthly issuance of
federally related ARM pass-throughs has been running well ahead of the pace
of the past few years. A number of mortgage borrowers have taken advantage
of narrowed spreads between short- and intermediate-term rates and have
opted for loans indexed to three- and five-year constant maturity Treasury
yields. Many of these loans, according to trade reports, are being
securitized. Thus, issuance of longer-term ARM securities, in particular,
has been strong and may continue at higher levels if the yield curve
maintains its current contour. The pickup in issuance of pass-throughs by
the agencies has not been confined to ARM-backed securities: Issuance of
fixed-rate pass-throughs also has increased to the fastest pace in more than
a year.

$4.4 billion portfolio of conventional pass-throughs nor its subsequent
sales of $1-1/2 billion of FHLMC pass-throughs had a lasting effect on
securities prices. Nonetheless, rumors that other thrifts will be forced to
liquidate their portfolios continue to circulate and have contributed to a
further widening of the spreads of mortgage-backed securities to comparable
Treasuries since the May FOMC meeting. These increases brought the spread
over ten-year Treasuries about 1/2 percentage point above its 1988 lows but
left it well within its range of recent years (chart).
In the primary mortgage market, the average contract rate on new
commitments for 30-year, fixed-rate conventional home loans is currently
75 basis points below its level at the time of the last FOMC meeting. The
average initial rate on ARMs indexed to the one-year constant maturity
Treasury yield, meanwhile, has declined 35 basis points over this period,
narrowing the initial rate advantage of ARMs over FRMs to 119 basis points,
near its five-year low. Moreover, data on ARM pricing suggest that lenders
have become less aggressive in pricing those loans. For example, initial
ARM rates have exceeded the one-year constant maturity Treasury yield by
more than 50 basis points on average in June; in the latter part of 1988 and
the first quarter of this year the spread was negative (chart).
Consumer Installment Credit
Growth of consumer installment credit outstanding slowed in April to a
4-3/4 percent annual rate after a 6-1/2 percent March rise (table).
Preliminary data for May suggest that credit growth continued at April's
reduced pace. The slowing in April occurred in the revolving credit
category; although such debt still rose at better than an 11 percent annual
rate, the advance was less than half as rapid as in the previous month and

well under the first-quarter pace. Automobile credit accelerated in
response to stronger sales incentives--both cash rebates and reduced
interest rates. The growth in auto loans was about evenly split between
finance companies and commercial banks. Total consumer credit, including
noninstallment loans, decelerated to a 5-1/2 percent annual rate in April
from 10 percent in the first quarter.
Measures of strains on household balance sheets continued to present a
mixed picture in the first quarter (table). While delinquencies on
mortgages and some types of consumer loans at commercial banks were down,
filings for personal bankruptcy increased, up 3-1/2 percent from the fourth
quarter and 8-1/2 percent from a year earlier. Perhaps reflecting the aging
of the low-interest rate loans made in 1985 and 1986, delinquency rates on
finance company auto loans rose further to 2.40 percent, but repossessions
of autos by finance companies have been relatively stable.
Still adjusting to earlier market movements, interest rates on consumer
loans at commercial banks increased 30 to 70 basis points between early
February and early May, at a time when open market rates actually fell
1/8 to 1/4 of a percentage point. By May, the most common rate on two-year
personal loans had risen 43 basis points to 15.6 percent and the rate on
four-year auto loans had increased to 12.4 percent, placing both rates at
their highest levels since late 1985. After-tax borrowing costs for many
consumers have been further boosted by the phased elimination of the
deductibility of interest paid on consumer borrowing. Only 20 percent of
this interest expense incurred in 1989 is deductible, and after next year
none of this expense will be deductible.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. Merchandise Trade
In April, the seasonally adjusted merchandise trade deficit was
$8.3 billion (Census basis, customs valuation); the deficit in March was
revised to $9.5 billion from $8.9 billion. The improvement in the trade
deficit so far this year reflects the strength of economic activity
abroad, the continuing (albeit diminished) positive effects on U.S.
price competitiveness of the past depreciation of the dollar, and the
temporary favorable effect of the recent rise in the dollar on holding
down prices of imports. Data for May will be available on July 18.
Exports in April were 1 percent higher than in March. A decline in
agricultural exports from high March levels was more than offset by

increases in most other major trade categories (especially industrial
supplies and machinery). Imports declined 3 percent as a rise in oil
imports was more than offset by declines in other items (especially
imports of automotive products, machinery, and foods). The rise in oil
imports was due largely to a 12 percent jump in price as the quantity of
oil imported rose only slightly (see the table on oil imports below).
For the first quarter, the deficit was $110.5 billion at an annual
rate (balance-of-payments basis), $17.5 billion smaller than in the
fourth quarter (revised). The first-quarter deficit was the lowest
since 1985-Q1.
Exports rose 6 percent in value and 4 percent in quantity in the
first quarter, and follow similarly strong growth in the fourth quarter.
Increases in quantity in the first quarter were largely in agricultural
exports (especially wheat and corn to the Soviet Union), industrial
supplies (primarily fuel of various types), and consumer goods
(particularly manufactured durables). By geographic region, most of the
increase in the value of exports was to Western Europe, Canada, and
Japan. These data include estimates of the commodity distribution of
undocumented exports to Canada based on newly available disaggregated
data from Canada.
While the value of imports rose marginally in the first quarter,
quantity declined 1 percent. The increase in value was accounted for
entirely by the rise in oil prices. The average price per barrel rose

more than 20 percent in the first quarter; the increase occurred largely
in response to a cut in production by OPEC. In April, the price of
imported oil rose $1.97 per barrel; the cumulative increase in the price
of imported oil from the low recorded last November through this April
has been about $5.70 per barrel. Spot and posted prices peaked in April
as markets responded to disruptions in supply caused by accidents in the
North Sea and Alaska. Since the peak, spot and posted prices of oil
have fallen about $1.00 per barrel, partly in response to an increase in
OPEC production. The quantity of imported oil declined in the first
quarter and in April from the strong fourth-quarter pace as inventories
were drawn down.
The value of non-oil imports declined 1 percent in the first
quarter, primarily because of lower quantity. The largest declines in
quantity were in consumer goods and automotive products, both of which
had increased sharply in the fourth quarter, and in industrial supplies.
Most of the decrease in consumer goods was in manufactured nondurables,
notably apparel and household goods from Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan.
The number of passenger cars imported from both Japan and Germany

decreased more than 20 percent, while those from Korea rose slightly.
Imports of capital goods increased somewhat, almost entirely because of
an increase in imports of computers and peripherals.
Import and Export Prices
During the first five months of 1989, the cumulative rise in prices
of non-oil imports was 1.2 percent at an annual rate, according to the
monthly indexes constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This
relatively flat picture for non-oil import prices during 1989 follows a
nearly 10 percent rate of increase in the fourth quarter of last year.
During the first five months of this year, the trade category showing
the largest increase was consumer goods (3.6 percent AR), only prices of
automotive imports declined (1.3 percent AR). A small increase in
prices in May followed a small decline in April; for the first quarter,
non-oil import prices rose 1.6 percent at an annual rate.
The increase in the price of exports during the first five months
of 1989 was 4.1 percent at an annual rate. The rise in export prices in
May was due entirely to a sharp rise in agricultural prices (reversing a
drop in the price of agricultural exports that had caused a decline in
total export prices in April). The price of total exports resumed its
upward trend in the first quarter following a slight decline in the
preceding quarter, largely due to a turnaround in the indices for food,
fuels, and crude materials.

U.S. Current Account: 1989-01
The U.S. current account deficit in 1989-Q1 widened $8.0 billion
(SAAR) from the fourth-quarter level. The increase occurred because of
a large negative swing from capital gains to capital losses on assets
denominated in foreign currencies, as the dollar's appreciation in 1989-
Q1 lowered the dollar value of foreign-currency denominated assets,
liabilities, depreciation, and inventory charges on the books of the
foreign affiliates of U.S. firms. Excluding the volatile capital gains
and losses, the current account improved by $22.4 billion in the first
quarter.

Nearly all of the $22.4 billion improvement in the adjusted current
account deficit resulted from an improvement in the trade balance; the
remainder was primarily a reduction in unilateral transfer payments from
a high level in the fourth quarter when Israel once again drew in the
first quarter of fiscal year 1989 nearly all of the grant funds provided
by the U.S. government. Net income on private portfolio investment was
little changed, though the gross flows were boosted by higher U.S.
interest rates.
Receipts from foreigners for both travel and passenger-fare
services declined a bit in the first quarter, following nine consecutive
quarters of increases, while payments to foreigners for travel services
increased about 2 percent; these figures included new estimates for
travel and passenger fare receipts and payments based on an ongoing in-
flight survey by the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration. In
addition, the levels of other private service receipts and payments were
revised upward substantially (based on new surveys of selected service
transactions with unaffiliated foreigners, and estimates for U.S.
students' expenditures abroad and foreign students' expenditures in the
United States). All these revisions added $10 billion in net receipts
to service transactions in 1988; the adjustments were carried back to
1981.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Private securities transactions continued to produce net capital
inflows in April (line 2 of the U.S. International Transactions table)

remained strong (line 2a). The downward trend in long-term dollar
interest rates since March together with the upward trend in the foreign
exchange value of the dollar since December have made U.S. dollar bonds
attractive with prospects for capital gains on both the price of the
bond and the currency translation -- motivations that intensified in May
and early June. During the first four months of 1989, net foreign
purchases of U.S. corporate and government agency bonds totaled $12-1/2
billion, well above the average rate during 1988. Private foreigners
also purchased net U.S. Treasury bonds in April. They sold bills,
however, producing net overall sales of Treasury securities in April of
$1-1/2 billion (line 3). For the year through April, private net
purchases of Treasury securities totaled $7 billion, a rate similar to
last year's.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks were negligible in
April and totaled only $0.1 billion for 1989 through April (line 2b).
This rate is similar to that of 1988, but is down significantly from
1987 when foreign transactions in U.S. stocks produced an inflow of $17
billion. U.S. residents bought net $1 billion in foreign securities in
April, bringing the net outflow for the first four months to $4-1/4
billion.
Foreign official net capital inflows in April were $5-1/2 billion
(line 4), bringing the total official inflow for the first four months
of 1989 to $13 billion. Increases in OPEC reserves account for about
one-half of this total; inflows from G-10 countries account for one-
fifth, despite sizable intervention sales of dollars during the period.

IV-11
The remainder is a mix of outflows by Latin American countries and
inflows by Taiwan, Korea, and Spain. Partial data from FRBNY indicate
that official reserves in the United States declined almost $4 billion
in May, reflecting very large intervention sales of dollars in the
month.
Net capital inflows through the banking system were negligible in
April after posting large inflows in February and March (line 1 of the
Summary table). In April, strong growth in time deposits and slower
growth in business and securities loans allowed U.S. banks to reduce net
Eurodollar borrowing. Through the first four months of 1989, there has
been a net outflow through the banking system of almost $5 billion.
Credit extended to U.S. nonbanks from banks outside of the United States
rose slightly in April and by $1 billion in May (line 2 of the
International Banking table, below) as the prime-LIBOR spread widened
70 basis points during the two months.
Recently released U.S. balance-of-payments data report large
foreign direct investment in the United States in the first quarter of
1989 (line 7 of the Summary table). The total for the fourth quarter of
1988 was also revised up substantially because of late reports. U.S.
direct investment abroad (line 6) was depressed in both the first
quarter of 1989 and the year 1988, in part by the sale of assets by
Texaco. However, plant and equipment expenditures by the foreign
affiliates of U.S. companies increased sharply in 1988 and are expected
to remain high in 1989, indicating continued expansion of the activities
of U.S. firms abroad.

IV-13
The statistical discrepancy in the U.S. international transactions
accounts (line 10) for past years has been reduced substantially by
revisions to recorded capital flows and by revised estimates of U.S.
service receipts and payments -- discussed above in the section on the
U.S. current account. For 1987 the discrepancy was reduced from an
inflow of $18-1/2 billion to an inflow of $2 billion. For 1988 the
discrepancy was revised from an inflow of $16-1/2 billion to an outflow
of $10-1/2 billion, owing mostly to a $20 billion revision to the
preliminary figure for the fourth quarter. The preliminary figure for
the first quarter of 1989 is an inflow of $13-1/2 billion.
Foreign Exchange Markets
Between the May FOMC meeting and June 14, the dollar rose 5 percent
to a 2-1/2 year high against the mark, DM 2.0470, and a 1-1/2 year high
against the yen, Y 151.90. Since reaching those highs, however, the
dollar has retraced much of its gains in the past two weeks. On
balance, the weighted-average exchange value of the dollar in terms of
the other G-10 currencies has risen about 2 percent since the May 16
FOMC meeting, as shown in the accompanying chart. The dollar has risen
1-1/2 percent against the mark, 4-1/2 percent against the yen, and 5-1/4
percent against sterling. Better-than-expected news on the U.S. trade
deficit initially underpinned the dollar's rise. In addition, political
events in China and Japan, and expectations of capital gains in the U.S.
bond market, temporarily generated increased demand for U.S. assets,
even as interest differentials narrowed. The dollar's sharp decline in
the last two weeks of the inter-meeting period did not appear to be

based on any new economic data nor even on a re-assessment of economic
fundamentals.
Intervention during the inter-meeting period was extremely large,
with total U.S. sales of $9 billion substantially exceeding U.S. sales
during the episode of dollar strength last summer.
Interest rate differentials between U.S. and foreign assets
narrowed during the inter-meeting period as U.S. interest rates eased,
especially U.S. long-term rates which declined about 70 basis points.
Japanese call money rose 85 basis points and Japanese three-month CD
rates increased 45 basis points as the Bank of Japan raised its discount
rate 3/4 percentage point to 3-1/4 percent. Japanese long-term rates
were little changed. In Germany, call money firmed 15 basis points
while the three-month interbank rate and the average of bond yields each
eased 15 basis points. In England, the three-month interbank rate rose
130 basis points, as the Bank of England raised its money-market dealing
rate 1 percentage point to 13-7/8 percent. On May 24, the Swiss
National Bank announced a new variable-rate Lombard facility, with the
Lombard rate to be set 100 basis points above the average call-money

rate of the preceding two days. The Swiss Lombard rate jumped within
three days to a peak of 9-1/2 percent, from 7 percent just prior to the
new policy, but more recently it has stabilized at around 8 percent.
The Spanish peseta joined the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS on
June 19 with a wide band of 6 percent.
.While the peseta is relatively strong now, the wide
band allows room for depreciation if that is necessary, given Spain's
relatively high inflation rate and large trade deficit.
U.S. bank lending to foreigners
The dollar value of U.S.-chartered banks' claims (all currencies)
on all foreigners increased by more than $4 billion (1 percent) in the
first quarter of 1989. During this period, the foreign exchange value
of the dollar in terms of other G-10 currencies rose by 6 percent.
Excluding estimated valuation effects due to changes in the value of the
dollar, total claims on foreigners increased by an estimated $10 billion
in the first quarter.
U.S. bank claims on non-OPEC developing countries rose by $1
billion in the first quarter. In Latin America, an increase in claims
on Brazil of $600 million (3 percent) was more than offset by declines
of $500 million each in Argentina and Mexico. Claims of U.S.-chartered
banks on other non-OPEC borrowers rose $1.7 billion; in particular,
claims on Taiwan rose by $1.3 billion to $4.9 billion.

have been relatively stable during the second quarter of 1989, after
rising in the aftermath of the announcement of the Brady initiative on
March 10. Nevertheless, there has been more day-to-day price volatility
as the market has reacted to the ebb and flow of news about the possible
outcome of Mexico's negotiations with its creditor banks.
In mid-June, Mexico returned to the international bond market for
the first time since 1982 with a $100 million issue. The five-year
Eurobond carried a 10-1/4 percent coupon and an issue price of slightly
less than 90, generating an average yield of about 17 percent. This is
below the roughly 28 percent yield implicit in the current secondary
market price of Mexican debt of about 40 percent of face value. The
difference in yields presumably reflects Mexico's good payment record on
bonds, a record that is likely to be maintained as long as amounts out-
standing remain small. Mexico's total public sector bonds outstanding
total less than $4 billion, including about $2.5 billion in bonds
exchanged for public sector debt at a discount in March 1988. Mexico's
total medium- and long-term public sector bank debt totals approximately
$54 billion.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Real economic activity accelerated in Japan, Germany, France, and
Canada in the first quarter, but slowed in the United Kingdom. Capacity
utilization also rose, on average, in the first quarter for the major
foreign industrial economies while unemployment rates were stable or
lower in most countries. Preliminary data from several countries point
to somewhat slower growth in the second quarter. Industrial production

expanded weakly in April in the United Kingdom, and fell in Canada in
March. In Japan production declined in April, but then partially
rebounded in May.
Inflation rates have moved up recently in nearly all major foreign
industrial economies. Higher oil prices and weakness of the other G-10
currencies against the dollar account for part of the increased price
pressure. Increases in indirect taxes in several countries, including
Japan, Germany, and Canada, also have contributed to rising prices.
Movements in external balances have shown a varied pattern.
Germany's cumulative current account surplus through April is more than
a third higher than last year's corresponding period. A sharp drop in
Japan's trade surplus in May brought its cumulative surplus so far this
year in line with the corresponding surplus of last year. Trade and
current account deficits have widened recently in France and Italy, but
have narrowed in Canada and the United Kingdom.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, the pace of economic activity
was very strong in the first quarter as real GNP rose 9.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.), up sharply from the 3.3 percent growth rate of the previous
quarter. Domestic demand grew 9.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter, as consumption increased 7.7 percent after being flat in the
previous quarter, and plant and equipment jumped 20.3 percent. In
contrast, housing investment declined by 7.5 percent. Exports jumped
34.0 percent (s.a.a.r.) while imports grew by an even more rapid 39.1
percent, resulting in a 0.8 percent negative contribution to growth from
net exports.

IV-24
Strong domestic demand growth in the first quarter appears to have
been due, at least in part, to purchases made in anticipation of the
introduction in April of a 3-percent consumption tax. As shown in the
table below, monthly data tend to confirm this shift in the pattern of
economic activity. Industrial production jumped by 5.4 percent (s.a.)
in March in advance of the tax, fell by 3.8 percent in April, then
rebounded by 0.9 percent in May. Retail sales rose 17 percent (s.a.) in
March, then dropped 18 percent in April. Reflecting the March surge in
activity, the capacity utilization rate rose by more than 5 percent
(s.a.) in March to its highest level in nearly a decade. The
unemployment rate remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive month at
2.3 percent (s.a.) in April.

Inflation rates have moved higher in recent months. Consumer
prices in Tokyo rose by 0.6 percent (n.s.a.) in May, following a 1.4
percent jump in April when the consumption tax was introduced. The 12-
month increase in Tokyo consumer prices rose to 3.3 percent in May, up
more than 2 percentage points from the rate at the end of last year. In
the 12 months to May, wholesale prices were 3.4 percent above the level

IV-25
a year earlier, compared with a 12-month decrease of 1.1 percent at the
end of last year.
The trade surplus rate for Japan dropped sharply in May to $43.2
billion (s.a.a.r.), about half theaverage surplus rate in the first
four months of the year. The lower surplus in May was due in part to
lower auto exports, possibly reflecting a changing seasonal pattern of
auto exports to the United States. So far this year, the trade surplus
has been $77.3 billion (s.a.a.r.), about unchanged from the trade
surplus last year.
On June 2, Sosuke Uno became the new Japanese Prime Minister.
Mr. Uno had been serving as Foreign Minister in the cabinet of outgoing
Prime Minister Takeshita, who was forced to resign because of the
Recruit scandal. Elections for one-half of the seats in the Upper House
of the Diet have been scheduled for July 23. Opinion polls continue to
show very low support for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Prime
Minister Uno.
Economic activity also accelerated in Germany in the first quarter
to 12 percent (s.a.a.r.), putting real GNP 4.2 percent above its year-
earlier level. Mild winter weather fostered a strong boom in
construction activity which accounted for two-thirds of the total
increase in first-quarter GNP. While this contribution is expected to
be transitory, net exports expanded even more rapidly than construction
in the first quarter, and investment in machinery and equipment also
advanced strongly. Other components, such as private and public
consumption, which contributed little, and inventories, which subtracted

IV-26
substantially from first-quarter growth, held real domestic demand
growth to a moderate 2.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter.
Other data shown in the accompanying table also indicate economic
strength in recent months. Industrial production moved up sharply in
April and stood 6.5 percent above its year-earlier level. Although
manufacturers' new orders were flat in April, they were still up 10.6
percent above year-earlier levels. In contrast, the unemployment rate
and the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing appear to have
stabilized recently.

Inflation remains a key policy concern in Germany. As shown in the
table on the next page, measures of inflation have accelerated this
year. Higher excise taxes in January, recent weakness in the deutsche
mark, and rising oil prices all have contributed to higher inflation.
A factor behind weakness in the mark has been the political
problems of Chancellor's Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, the largest
party in the ruling government coalition. The CDU has sustained a
series of electoral losses recently in both local elections and the

IV-27
European parliamentary elections, and is trailing a potential liberal
opposition coalition in the polls.

Germany's monthly external surpluses fell in April from year-
earlier levels--the first such drop in 1989. The trade surplus was $5.3
billion (n.s.a.) in April, versus $5.7 billion in April 1988. However,
the cumulative trade and current account surpluses for the first four
months of 1989 remained substantially above last year's rate. The
widening of Germany's trade surplus so far in 1989 reflects largely a
further increase in its trade surplus within the EC; its surplus with
the United States has continued to decline.
In France, recent data indicate that activity has remained
moderately strong while inflationary pressure has picked up in recent
months. Preliminary figures for French GNP showed that first-quarter
real growth rebounded to a rate of nearly 5 percent (s.a.a.r.), well
above the 1.6 percent rate of growth recorded in the fourth quarter.
Industrial production more than recovered from a nearly 1 percent drop
in March with a sharp 3-1/4 percent (s.a.) gain in April to a level
almost 7-1/2 percent above the level in April 1988. Capacity

IV-28
utilization continued to edge upward in the first quarter, and the
unemployment rate eased slightly to 9.9 percent (s.a.) in May.
Consumer prices moved up 0.4 percent (s.a.) in May to a level 3.7
percent above the May 1988 level. Recent increases were led by a
particularly strong upward movement in the price of manufactured goods
and by a sharp increase in the price of petroleum products. Concerns
about inflationary pressure were heightened by preliminary reports that
wages rose about 1-1/4 percent in the first quarter to a level almost 4
percent above their year-earlier level. New monetary data for March
show, however, that French M-2 was still growing at an annual rate below
the official target range of 4-5 percent.
After narrowing steadily in the first three months of the year to
less than $50 million (s.a.) in March, the French trade deficit widened
sharply in April to more than $600 million. The deterioration of French
trade is attributable almost entirely to a nearly 3-1/2 percent decline
in manufactured exports.
In the United Kingdom, activity appears to have weakened somewhat.
The average measure of real GDP increased by 1.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
the first quarter. The output measure, which authorities consider the
most reliable measure of short-run movements in activity, increased by
only 0.4 percent. Industrial production rose by 0.5 percent in April
but was only 1.1 percent above its year-earlier level. The volume of
retail sales fell 1.4 percent (s.a.) in April, lowering the 12-month
increase to 2.6 percent. The unemployment rate continued to decline in
May, moving down to 6.4 percent (s.a.).

IV-29
Consumer price inflation has continued to accelerate with the 12-
month increase moving up to 8.3 percent in May. Excluding mortgage
interest payments, the rate edged up to 6 percent. The increase in
average earnings remained at 9-1/4 percent in the year to April.
The U.K. trade deficit decreased in May to $2.8 billion (s.a.).
Through the first five months of this year, the trade deficit rate was
$40.6 billion (s.a.a.r.), somewhat greater than the deficit rate of last
year.
Real GDP in Canada increased 3.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter, up from the 2-1/2 percent annual rate of the two previous
quarters. Domestic demand rose by 5.0 percent (s.a.a.r.) while net
exports subtracted slightly from growth. Other indicators present mixed
signals of current strength in the economy. Unemployment fell to 7.7
percent (s.a.) in May, and retail sales surged 2.3 percent (s.a.) in
April after three consecutive monthly declines. However, housing starts
fell 9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in May following an 8.4 percent drop in April.
A 1.0 percent increase in the consumer price index in May (the
largest monthly increase since 1983) brought Canada's 12-month inflation
rate to 5.0 percent. About half of the increase has been attributed to
new sales and excise taxes, and half to higher food and energy prices.
Preliminary data in Italy indicate that real GDP grew 3.6 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, slightly less than the growth rates
seen during the second half of last year. Measures of inflation appear
to have stabilized after absorbing the effects of the implementation of

IV-30
higher indirect taxes late last year. The consumer price index in May
stood 6.8 percent above its level a year ago.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Argentina remains in a severe economic crisis; although the
economic and financial markets reacted positively at first to the news
that President Alfonsin will transfer power on July 8 to President-elect
Menem, they again became volatile when Menem disclosed the low level of
foreign exchange reserves. Mexico has extended its anti-inflation
social pact through March 1990, as it continues to negotiate with banks
for a package of new money, debt reduction, and debt-service reduction.
Mexico, Venezuela, and the Philippines have obtained substantial
financial assistance from the IMF and the World Bank. Mexico and the
Philippines have also obtained multi-year Paris Club debt reschedulings.
Venezuela has launched a comprehensive trade liberalization program.
Brazil's worsening internal financial situation led the government to
reintroduce indexed government debt and to resume daily devaluations.
There was also a major stock market crisis there in June. Nigeria has
cleared its outstanding interest arrears to banks, and its debt
restructuring has become effective.
Individual country notes. Argentina remains in a severe economic
crisis. The economic and financial markets reacted positively at first
to the news that President Alfonsin will transfer power to President-
elect Carlos Menem on July 8, rather than in December 1989, as
originally scheduled. However, they again became volatile when Menem
disclosed the low level of foreign exchange reserves.

IV-31
In the run-up to and the aftermath of the May 14 presidential
election, which Peronist Party candidate Carlos Menem won more
decisively than expected, Argentina approached economic chaos. The
monthly rate of increase of the CPI more than doubled in May to 79
percent, and is likely to exceed 100 percent in June. In the face of
accelerating price increases, a severe cash shortage developed and
economic activity became deeply depressed. In this period, interest
rates fluctuated widely, and the black market exchange rate depreciated
sharply.
Menem reportedly plans to implement an economic package soon after
he takes office that would include deep cuts in public expenditures, tax
reform, a significant devaluation of the currency, and wage increases.
His economic team seems to be orthodox, and the fact that he has
political support encourages belief that his proposals may have a chance
of being put into effect.
In June, Argentina cleared a substantial part of its arrears to the
IMF and World Bank, which had been accumulating for a few months. This
was accomplished in part with the help of a $150 million bridge loan
from Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela.
Mexico has extended its anti-inflation social pact to March 31,
1990, as it continues to negotiate with commercial banks for a package
of new money, debt reduction, and debt-service reduction. In recent
weeks, Mexico has obtained a three-year SDR 2.8 billion Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) arrangement and an SDR 453.5 million Compensatory and
Contingency Financing Facility drawing from the IMF, three World Bank

IV-32
loans totalling $1.5 billion to support structural reforms, and a Paris
Club rescheduling covering $2.5 billion in payments due through May
1992. The equivalent of 30 percent of the EFF and 25 percent of the
three World Bank loans will be set aside for debt reduction operations.
Additional resources from the IMF, the World Bank, and the Government of
Japan are expected to be available to Mexico for debt reduction and
debt-service reduction operations, bringing the probable total for these
operations to about $5-1/2 billion. Mexico may use some of its own
financial resources for this purpose as well.
The social pact, which governs exchange rate, price, and wage
policies, was to have expired July 31. At the signing ceremony formally
extending it, President Salinas said that removal of the July deadline
relieved the pressure to accept any agreement with the banks and gave
Mexico time to reach a satisfactory external debt arrangement.
The Mexico City stock market index, which has risen by more than 70
percent since March 1, rose strongly further after the pact extension
was announced. On June 26, it was only 4 percent below its October 1987
pre-crash all-time high. The 28-day Treasury bill rate has risen 10
percentage points since March 14 as fears of a maxi-devaluation
increased, and was 57 percent at the June 20 auction.
On June 23, several days after the pact extension was signed, the
authorities announced a 6 percent increase in minimum wages, effective
July 1.
The Brazilian authorities, responding to rising prices and interest
rates over the first two weeks of June, devalued the cruzado by 5.5

IV-33
percent on June 13 and announced on June 15 that they would reintroduce
indexed government debt and resume daily devaluations. Since then,
prices and interest rates have risen further. Monthly inflation is
likely to be around 25 percent in June, compared with 9.9 percent in
May. The overnight money market rate rose from 27 percent per month
June 12 to 44.5 percent on June 27. However, the spread between the
parallel and official exchange rates has fallen from the 200 percent
high it reached in April to about 110 percent June 26. Some of the fall
is attributed to dollar sales by brokerage houses that experienced
losses in the stock exchanges in June.
The stock exchange losses stemmed from a major crisis that erupted
June 9 when a large investor, who had been speculating in options and
futures contracts, stopped payment on checks totalling 39 million
cruzados ($29 million at the official exchange rate). Five brokerage
houses were closed by the Central Bank June 21. Losses, which are
expected to be covered by members of the exchange, are estimated at 200
million cruzados ($148 million). In the aftermath, Central Bank
president Elmo Camoes resigned June 22, principally because of his
family involvement in a major brokerage house. Wadico Waldir Bucchi,
director of the banking department of the Central Bank, has been
appointed interim president. Early this week, stock prices in the Rio
and Sao Paulo exchanges were 30-40 percent lower than before the crisis.
Brazil continued to register sizable trade surpluses in April
($1.3 billion) and May ($1.4 billion). Exports in May were higher than
expected, given the considerable dollar premium in the parallel market.

IV-34
The cumulative surplus in January-May totaled $7 billion, about the same
as in the same period of 1988. The April and May surpluses, however,
were lower than in the same months last year.
Since mid-June, Venezuela has obtained a three-year SDR 3.7 billion
Extended Fund Facility arrangement from the IMF and World Bank loans of
$402 million for Structural Adjustment and $353 million for Trade Policy
reforms. Up to 25 percent of this assistance will be set aside for debt
reduction operations. Negotiations with commercial banks on a public
sector debt restructuring combined with new money and debt reduction are
essentially on hold pending the results of the Mexican negotiations.
Meanwhile, a group of banks is attempting to raise $600 million in
interim financing. Some public sector interest arrears to banks of more
than 90 days have accumulated over the past several months.
The government has announced an overhaul of the country's complex
and distortionary system of tariff and trade restrictions. With the
assistance of the World Bank under the Trade Policy loan, the
authorities have begun to remove quantitative restrictions on 2,000
tariff items produced by domestic industry and to lower the maximum
tariff from 135 percent to 80 percent. Over the next four years, the
tariff system is to be further simplified and maximum rates are to be
cut to 20 percent.
In mid-June, the Central Bank raised minimum deposit and maximum
loan interest rates by a further five percentage points each; however,
these rates remain below the expected rate of inflation. Since the
economic reform program was launched in February, growth of the money

IV-35
supply has been negative in real terms and the fiscal deficit has been
cut substantially. The monthly inflation rate, which surged to 21.3
percent in March in the wake of exchange rate devaluation, the freeing
of many controlled prices, and wage increases, was down to 6.4 percent
in May.
In May, the Philippines obtained a three-year SDR 660.6 million
Extended Fund Facility arrangement (EFF) and a SDR 286.3 million
Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility drawing from the IMF, a
$300 million financial sector adjustment loan from the World Bank, and a
Paris Club rescheduling of about $2.2 billion representing arrears and
payments of principal and interest falling due through June 1991. The
equivalent of 25 percent of each purchase under the EFF will be set
aside for debt reduction operations. However, the World Bank loan was
approved before the World Bank had adopted a policy in support of debt
reduction operations. As a result, no part of this loan is earmarked
for this purpose.
Nigeria's $5.7 billion commercial bank debt restructuring agreed to
in March became effective on June 7 upon clearance of about $40 million
in outstanding interest arrears.
