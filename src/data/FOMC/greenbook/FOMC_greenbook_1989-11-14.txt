The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
With the service sectors generating healthy gains in employment and
income, the economy continued to expand into the fourth quarter. However,
industrial activity has declined noticeably recently, owing not only to
sluggish demand, but also to supply shocks, including the ongoing strike at
Boeing. Signals on inflation trends have been mixed: Consumer prices have
risen less rapidly than they rose earlier in the year, largely reflecting
declines in the prices of oil and of imported goods, while year-over-year
increases in wages and in total compensation have been at least as large as
in recent quarters.
Labor Markets
Labor demand continued to grow in recent months, but at a slower pace
than that earlier in the year. On a strike-adjusted basis, private sector
employment increased 146,000 in October and was up at an average pace of
only 115,000 over the past three months, well below the pace of the first
half. The slowdown in hiring has been concentrated in manufacturing, where
employment has declined since the spring. Job losses have been largest in
the metals, machinery, and equipment industries, while employment in most
nondurable industries has been little changed on balance. In contrast,
employment growth in the service-producing sector has been well maintained.
Hiring by state and local governments, largely for school systems, has been
robust and accounts for more than a third of the increase in total strike-
adjusted employment over the past three months.

1. The approximately 57,000 striking machinists at Boeing are not included
in the October strike figures because they were reported at work during the
survey week, October 8-14. Although the machinists' strike began on
October 4, Boeing reports payroll employment over a two-week pay period, as
do many firms, and the striking machinists were on the payrolls for the
first 2-1/2 days of the pay period.
2. About 59,000 workers at NYNEX remain on strike.
In the household survey, the civilian unemployment rate stayed at
5.3 percent in October. The levels of unemployment and employment reported
in this survey have been little changed since June, while payroll employment
has continued to increase. Indeed, since 1985, growth in the household
count of persons employed has fallen short of the payroll figures on growth
in jobs by 1.7 million. A special supplement to the household survey,
conducted in May, suggests that a sharp increase in the number of
individuals who hold more than one job explains much of the divergence
between the two measures. The survey found that 7.2 million persons were
working at more than one job in May 1989, up nearly 1.5 million since May
1985, the last time this survey was conducted. About 1.1 million of these
additional multiple jobholders held jobs as nonagricultural wage and salary

workers and thus would have been included more than once in the payroll
survey.
New claims for unemployment insurance have drifted up to about 350,000
in recent weeks, compared with around 300,000 early this year; this
situation likely reflects the cutbacks in jobs reported in manufacturing.
Recent experience suggests that an increase in the overall unemployment rate
is likely to be associated with a sustained level of claims of about 375,000
to 400,000 per week.
Industrial Production
Growth in industrial production slowed to about 1-1/4 percent at an
annual rate in the third quarter, compared with a rise of about
2-3/4 percent in the first half. Output in recent months has been held down
by cutbacks in motor vehicle assemblies, but gains in some other major
categories also were smaller. The deceleration was especially noticeable in
the business equipment area; output of computers showed little net change
after a surge in the spring, while production of other equipment (excluding
motor vehicles) also leveled out in the past few months. Output of
materials remained lackluster in recent months, in part because of weak
demand for metals and for parts for consumer goods.
This fall's production figures will be buffeted by several transitory
developments. Our early calculations suggest that the strike against Boeing
cut roughly 1/2 percent from the level of overall production in October.
And perhaps another 1/4 percent was taken off by Hurricane Hugo, which led--
among other things--to the closing of an aluminum smelting plant in South
Carolina for three months, and the San Francisco earthquake, which led to
some temporary plant closings in high technology industries.

Aside from these temporary factors, incoming data do not indicate any
significant change in industrial production in October. Production worker
hours in manufacturing, excluding transportation equipment, were little
changed last month. Among the physical product data, those for motor
vehicle assemblies were lower than in September, while other readings were
mixed.
Forward-looking indicators generally suggest that industrial output
will be sluggish over the next few months. In particular, orders for
durable goods excluding civilian aircraft and motor vehicles, despite some
pickup in August and September, have shown no growth on net since the
spring.
Leading Indicators of Recession
Considerable research in recent years has been devoted to developing
econometric procedures to assess the likelihood of a recession. These
procedures compare recent movements in an index of leading indicators with
the pattern of movements just before and during previous recessions. To a
large extent, the leading indicator indexes bring together many of the
series routinely reported elsewhere in the Greenbook. The econometric
procedures can be thought of as simplified ways of summarizing and
interpreting these forward-looking indicators.
A recession-probability measure based on the Commerce Department's
index of leading economic indicators indicates that the probability of a
recession developing in the next six months increased last spring but has
since declined somewhat; the latest reading, based on the September leading

indicators report, was 17 percent. A second measure is based on a
leading index recently compiled by the NBER, which relies less heavily on
data from the manufacturing sector than does the Commerce Department index
and does not include stock prices. During the past year, its associated
probabilities generally have been in the same range as those from the
Commerce Department index; as of September, it showed a 13 percent
probability that a recession would start in the next six months.
Personal Income and Consumption
Real disposable income jumped 4-3/4 percent at an annual rate last
quarter after edging up less than 1 percent at an annual rate during the
second quarter. Most of the pickup in real income growth reflected a sharp
deceleration in consumption prices. In addition, personal tax payments
dropped back after a second-quarter bulge in nonwithheld taxes. Income
gains were held down, however, by smaller increases in interest receipts
during the third quarter, and rental income was temporarily depressed by
write-offs of property losses associated with Hurricane Hugo.
Real personal consumption expenditures grew 5-3/4 percent at an annual
rate during the third quarter--up sharply from the 2 percent pace of the
second quarter. In part, the surge in spending reflected an increase in

sales of autos and trucks, as manufacturers cut prices to reduce stocks at
the end of the model year. However, outlays for other goods also posted
strong gains. Notably, spending on food moved up a bit after dropping
sharply the quarter before, and spending on apparel jumped after a
lackluster first half. However, the pattern of improvement was not uniform
across all categories of spending. For example, outlays for furniture and
household equipment fell back in the third quarter after moving up rapidly
over the preceding three quarters.
The accompanying chart helps put these various developments in a
longer-term perspective. Each panel plots a different component of PCE on
the vertical axis against real disposable income on the horizontal axis.
For reference, a trend line also is shown in each panel; the trend line
shows the average relationship between income and each component of spending
and is estimated with data covering the current expansion. In each panel,
the third-quarter observation is plotted as a triangle (the second quarter
as a circle). As shown in the upper left panel, outlays for food have
remained relatively weak compared to income, despite the recent uptick. By
contrast, the surge in spending on apparel (upper right panel) has restored
spending in that category to its average position relative to income.
Recent furniture purchases (lower left panel) have been about in line with
the expansion average, while spending on other nonauto goods appears to have
fallen below trend.
Autos and Light Trucks
Sales of new cars and light trucks dropped sharply in October from
their robust pace in the third quarter; on BEA seasonals, October sales were
at a 13 million unit annual rate--down from the third-quarter average of

16 million units. The slower pace of sales during October had been
expected, and it reflected the "payback" of sales that had been moved
forward into August and September. The drop in sales was concentrated among
domestically produced vehicles, but import sales also fell somewhat.
Overall, incentives to customers and dealers reduced prices of autos
built by the three major U.S. manufacturers by an estimated $675 per vehicle
during the 1989 model year. The use of incentives was especially heavy
during the third quarter (an estimated $1,100 per vehicle) as automakers
sought to clear out the 1989 model-year cars. So far, the manufacturers
show no sign of moving away from their incentive-based marketing strategy:
In the 1990 model year, incentive programs have already been announced for a
wide array of cars and trucks at the same time that sticker prices have, on

average, been raised substantially. Many of the foreign automakers also are
offering incentives on their cars and trucks.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment rose at a 5 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, down from the 8 percent pace in the first half. The slowing
was more than accounted for by a deceleration in outlays for producers'
durable equipment, from 12 percent growth in the first half, to 5 percent in
the third quarter. In contrast to the deceleration in equipment
purchases, real outlays for nonresidential structures increased nearly 6
percent in the third quarter, after several quarters of declines, mainly
because of a sharp rise in BEA's measure of oil and gas drilling activity.
The deceleration in PDE last quarter reflected a flattening in outlays
for information-processing equipment after a strong first-half advance
(table). In contrast, spending was up at a somewhat faster pace last
quarter for most major types of industrial equipment, and transportation
equipment also made a positive contribution to growth after a flat first
half.
Indicators of investment plans do not imply much strength in the near
term. Nondefense capital goods orders, weighted to include only the
fraction that are final business purchases, fell another 3/4 percent in the
third quarter, suggesting that equipment outlays will remain sluggish in the
3. Recently released data on shipments excluding aircraft are somewhat
weaker than BEA's third-quarter assumption. However, BEA's assumption for
aircraft shipments in September seems too low, given information from
sources at Boeing. A more reasonable assumption for September suggests a
sizable upward revision to purchases of aircraft in the third quarter. On
balance, we expect about a $1.0 billion upward revision to producers'
durable equipment in the third quarter, which would raise the growth rate to
about 6 percent at an annual rate.

fourth quarter. Indicators for nonresidential structures also are not
upbeat. Construction permits have trended down for the past several months
(chart), and in the oil industry the Baker-Hughes rig count, which fell
2-1/2 percent in the first three weeks of October from its third-quarter
level, suggests that the recent growth in drilling construction has not
continued. Finally, shipments of aircraft to domestic airlines are being
reduced in the fourth quarter by the Boeing strike, which began in early
October.
Looking ahead to 1990, the only available survey of planned plant and
equipment spending suggests slow growth in nominal terms next year as well.
The Economic Consulting and Planning Inc. survey, taken in September and
early October, indicates that firms expect to increase nominal outlays
3 percent in 1990 (table), well below the 10 percent rate expected for 1989.
This survey, previously conducted by the Merrill Lynch Economic Consulting
Group, should be read with considerable caution as it has often made large
errors, and ECAP indicated to us that, this year, an unusually large number
of respondents did not yet have 1990 spending plans available.
Business Inventories
Inventories apparently accumulated somewhat more rapidly over the
summer than in the first half, primarily in the manufacturing sector. In
constant-dollar terms, inventories in all manufacturing and trade rose at an
annual rate of $27 billion on average in July and August, compared with a
rate of $13 billion in the first half. Nonetheless, shipments and sales
have, on balance, kept pace with the increases in stocks, and inventory-
sales ratios in all major sectors in August were little changed from levels
observed during the first half of this year (chart).

Manufacturers' inventories were reduced a bit in current-cost terms in
September. In constant-dollar terms, these inventories had posted large
increases in the previous two months. The steady decline in the
manufacturers' inventory-sales ratio that had been evident over the 1984-88
period appears to have stalled so far this year. In part, this pattern has
reflected the buildup of work-in-progress stocks at aircraft manufacturers.
But although inventories overall have stayed in line with trends in sales,
some scattered, small imbalances may be cropping up as firms adjust to an
environment of slower growth. For example, the inventory-sales ratio in
primary metals--where production has fallen recently--is a bit higher than a
year ago. Ratios in a number of nondurable categories, notably paper and
chemicals, have also edged up.
In the trade sector, inventory accumulation slowed significantly in
August. Wholesale inventories were drawn down a bit, and nonauto retail
stocks rose at less than half the pace posted in July. The recent retail
inventory increase has been well supported by sales: The inventory-sales
ratio for these stores has remained at roughly the same level that has
prevailed over the past few years (chart, bottom panel).
Housing Markets
Housing construction has remained weak in recent months. Total private
housing starts declined 5 percent in September to 1.26 million units, owing
mainly to a drop in multifamily starts. Issuance of building permits
roughly paralleled the movement of starts: Multifamily permits fell while
single-family permits were essentially flat.
Single-family starts have been little changed in recent months at
around 1 million units at an annual rate, even though interest rates on

fixed-rate mortgage loans have fallen considerably since the spring. Starts
have dropped in the Northeast, the only region in which new-home inventories
have remained high, judging by historical norms. Starts in the other three
major regions appear to have firmed in the third quarter after declining in
the first half.
Sales of new homes, which had strengthened substantially in the late
spring and summer months, dropped 14 percent in September to 618,000 units
at an annual rate. Despite the decline, new home sales averaged a robust
693,000 unit annual rate in the third quarter, compared with 630,000 units
in the first half. In addition, sales of existing homes increased 4 percent
in September, to 3.6 million units at an annual rate, the highest level
since late 1988.
In the multifamily sector, starts dropped 14 percent in September to
292,000 units, the lowest level since mid-1982, and permit issuance fell
sharply as well. These multifamily starts and permits figures for September
seem surprisingly low, even in light of the adverse effects of 1986 tax law
changes on the after-tax profitability of investment in rental housing and
the persistent overstock of multifamily units.
Federal Government
In September, the federal government recorded a budget deficit of
$6.2 billion, bringing the total FY1989 budget deficit to $152.1 billion on
4a budget basis. Outlays surged in September, in part because of the
Resolution Trust Corporation's (RTC) net outlays of $5.8 billion.
Nevertheless, RTC's spending for the year as a whole fell almost $10 billion
4. An overview of the federal budget in FY1989 and the status of
legislation for FY1990 are presented in the appendix.

short of the amount authorized in FIRREA. In addition, a military pay
date was shifted from October into September, adding about $3 billion to
defense outlays. Largely as a result of these factors, outlays reached
$105.4 billion in September, about 10 billion above the average for the
preceding eleven months of the fiscal year. On the receipts side of the
budget, individual income taxes rose about as expected in September, boosted
by quarterly estimated tax payments. Corporate payments were consistent
with the general picture of sagging profits.
Federal purchases of goods and services declined in the third quarter
in the NIPA, owing to a run-off of CCC inventories. Excluding CCC, real
purchases rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate. Defense spending rose somewhat
from its second-quarter level but remained slightly below a year earlier.
Real nondefense purchases excluding CCC were essentially unchanged last
quarter, but over the past four quarters they have advanced 4.3 percent,
largely owing to spending on the space program. Outlays also have risen in
other high priority areas such as health research, tax enforcement, and drug
interdiction and crime control, but these increases have been largely offset
elsewhere in federal accounts.
Recent natural disasters, namely Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco
area earthquake, are expected to boost federal spending beginning in the
fourth quarter. These outlays will fall in a variety of categories,
including purchases of goods and services for relief operations, grants to
state and local governments for highway and other reconstruction, as well as
5. A large portion of the remaining funds apparently were used in October
to sell several deeply insolvent thrifts, negotiations for which could not
be completed by the end of September.

II-25
some welfare assistance. Disaster loans also are being extended, but these
are not included in the NIPA federal sector.
State and Local Governments
BEA estimates that real purchases of goods and services by state and
local governments grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter,
above the 1.8 percent rise during the first half, but still well below the
average increase during the current economic expansion. During the third
quarter, real outlays for construction rose slightly, after falling in the
first half. In the current quarter, capital investment is likely to be
boosted by the start of reconstruction of public works, primarily highways
and bridges, that were damaged during the recent earthquake in the San
Francisco area. Congress has approved $1 billion in aid through the Federal
Highway Administration Emergency Fund.
The budget position of the state and local sector remains quite weak.
Trade association and newspaper accounts indicate that many states continue
to struggle with fiscal pressures. At the local level, a recent survey of
360 cities indicated that municipal governments also have endured increased
stress in their general funds budgets. Indeed, this year has seen a rise in
the percent of cities with large deficits (chart). Moreover, the
deterioration has come despite widespread attempts to balance budgets.
Sixty-nine percent of cities reported increases in existing fees and
charges, while 36 percent said they instituted new fees, and 41 percent of
the cities hiked property tax rates during the past year. In addition,
36 percent of the cities cut capital spending.

Wages, Prices, and Productivity
Wages. A large volume of data on compensation trends has been
published in recent weeks. All told, it shows no remission of labor cost
pressures, and indeed, suggests that wages may be accelerating gradually.
Hourly compensation of private industry workers as measured by the
employment cost index (ECI) increased 4-3/4 percent over the twelve months
ended in September, about 1/4 percentage point more than in the preceding
year. The twelve-month change in average hourly earnings--the monthly
indicator of wages for production and nonsupervisory workers--remained at
4 percent in October, similar to its pace since the turn of the year, but up
from its 1988 pace. However, the ECI measure of wages and salaries, which
is not influenced by shifts in employment across industries and occupations,
rose 4-1/2 percent over the twelve months ended in September and has been
accelerating steadily since late 1987. Benefit costs have been rising in
excess of 6 percent for the past two years, almost twice the pace of 1987.
The large increase this year reflects a double-digit advance in the cost of
health insurance.
By industry, gains in compensation as measured by the ECI were largest
in the service-producing sector, where employment growth has been rapid. In
the twelve months ended in September, compensation in this sector was up
5.4 percent. The biggest increase was seen in finance, insurance, and real
estate where compensation rose 8.0 percent over the past year, boosted by a
large increase in sales commissions. Compensation costs for hospitals also
rose sharply--up 6.6 percent over the past year--as demand for health
workers remained strong. In the goods-producing sector, compensation was up

4.1 percent over the past twelve months, a bit less than the gain over the
same period last year.
Productivity and costs. Productivity in the nonfarm business sector
rose 2.1 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, but was up only
0.9 percent over the past four quarters, somewhat below our current estimate
of its underlying trend rate of 1.4 percent. With the slowing pace of
productivity growth and a small pickup in hourly compensation, unit labor
costs in the nonfarm business sector have accelerated to 4-1/2 percent over
the latest four quarters. Productivity in the manufacturing sector rose
only 1.4 percent in the third quarter, substantially below the recent trend,
reflecting the slowing in industrial output. Over the past year,
productivity growth has edged down slightly in the manufacturing sector, to
a 2-1/2 percent gain.
Prices. Recent monthly price reports have given mixed signals about
the near-term direction of inflation. The consumer price index rose only
0.2 percent in September, held down by declines in retail energy prices and
relatively small increases in other prices. In contrast, producer prices of
finished goods jumped 0.9 percent in September, reversing the declines of
the three preceding months, as energy prices rebounded at the producer level
and seasonal adjustment difficulties caused the index reported for motor
vehicle prices to jump sharply.
The CPI for energy was down nearly 1 percent in September. Gasoline
prices declined more than 2 percent, reflecting in part the easing of vapor
pressure standards at the end of the summer. However, refinery and wellhead
prices rose sharply in the September PPI, and both posted and spot prices of
crude oil moved up further into mid-October. These higher crude oil costs

II-32
should show up in retail energy prices, and indeed, a private survey showed
increases in gasoline prices in October.
Food prices rose 0.2 percent in the September CPI, the fourth month of
relatively small increases after the runup earlier this year. In September,
declines in prices of pork, poultry, coffee, and fresh vegetables offset
much of the increases for other foods. Producer prices of crude and
finished foods were down in September, and the current outlook for farm
output and crop inventories appears consistent with moderate increases in
retail food prices in coming months. The main exception at present is dairy
prices, which have surged in response to a tighter supply situation here and
abroad.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose 0.2 percent in September.
The services component was held down by a 4-1/2 percent decline for out-of-
town lodging, which offset part of the increase in other categories.
However, the commodities component, which had declined 0.3 percent in
August, turned up 0.4 percent in September, boosted by a 1.8 percent jump in
apparel prices. The September increase for apparel, associated with the
introduction of fall and winter clothing, followed declines over the
preceding three months attributable to unusually heavy discounting of summer
items. Car prices fell in September for the fifth consecutive month.
Smoothing through the recent figures, the CPI for commodities excluding
food and energy has risen 2-3/4 percent over the past twelve months, a
deceleration of about 3/4 percentage point relative to the previous twelve-
month period. An important influence on this slowdown has been a moderation

in the rate of increase in the prices of imported goods. Although the BLS
does not compile separate indexes for the retail prices of foreign and
domestically produced goods, inferences can be made about the influence of
import prices by examining those components of the CPI with higher-than-
average trade shares. As shown in the table, the deceleration has been
widespread, but is especially large for items such as new motor vehicles and
apparel. In contrast, prices of domestically produced consumer goods other
than food and energy, as measured by the producer price index, have risen
4-1/2 percent over the past twelve months, somewhat more than during the
preceding year.
At the producer level, motor vehicle prices have continued to dominate
month-to-month movements in the PPI for finished goods less food and energy.
In September, prices of passenger cars and light trucks were up 3.8 and
3.5 percent, respectively, on a seasonally adjusted basis, accounting for
much of the increase in the indexes for both consumer and capital goods.
The increases in motor vehicle prices reflect relatively small unadjusted
declines, as compared with those "expected" by the PPI seasonals. In past
years, motor vehicle manufacturers typically extended substantial end-of-
model-year liquidation allowances to dealers in September. This year,
widespread incentive programs to reduce inventories were instituted in July,
resulting in large price declines in that month.
Prices of intermediate materials excluding food and energy have changed
little in recent months, in marked contrast to earlier in the year, when
these prices were rising rapidly. At the same time, though, the rate of
price increase for finished goods excluding food and energy has been about
unchanged. Historical experience suggests that such a deceleration in

intermediate materials prices usually is associated with some deceleration
in finished goods prices as well. Regression analysis indicates that, over
the course of a quarter, a one-percentage-point drop in inflation for
intermediate materials excluding food and energy typically is accompanied by
a 0.3-percentage-point decline in finished goods inflation (excluding food
and energy). Such a model predicts that the 7-percentage-point deceleration
in intermediate materials prices over the past year normally would be
associated with a 2-percentage-point drop in the rate of increase for
finished goods prices; these prices actually decelerated by only
1/4 percentage point.7

An important factor in assessing the near-term outlook is the simple
relationship that seems to exist between the finished goods and intermediate
materials indexes. The linkage is a contemporaneous one; past movements in
intermediate materials prices do not have a statistically significant effect
on finished goods prices, so that finished goods prices will not tend to
"catch up" with the past deceleration in intermediate materials prices. On
the other hand, errors in the estimated relationship do not have a tendency
to persist, so that the model predicts that the historical relationship

APPENDIX
THE FEDERAL BUDGET IN FY1989 AND THE STATUS OF LEGISLATION FOR FY1990
Fiscal year 1989 closed with a federal budget deficit of $152.1
billion, according to the Monthly Treasury Statement released on October 27.
This compares with a deficit of $155.2 billion in FY88, and with OMB and CBO
estimates last winter of $161 billion and $160 billion, respectively
(table 1). The better-than-expected deficit is entirely attributable to the
strong performance of receipts, which grew by 9.1 percent between FY88 and
FY89--well in excess of nominal GNP growth--while outlays were boosted to a
7.5 percent growth rate, in part by the unusual amount of thrift insurance
activity. Over the 1985-89 period, the deficit has declined relative to GNP
and saving, particularly when adjusted for transitory factors, but the
prospects for meaningful further improvement in 1990 are uncertain. This
appendix reviews the major factors affecting the deficit in FY89, the
deficit reduction progress that has been made in recent years, and the
status of legislation for FY90.
The unusual strength in federal tax receipts last year was concentrated
in individual income tax collections (table 2), which showed surprising
strength around the time of the final payments last April and, for the year
as a whole, picked up markedly from an already brisk average growth rate
over the 1986-88 period. A small part of the 1989 receipts overrun
appeared, following the July national income revisions, to reflect more
growth of taxable nominal personal income (largely components other than
wages and salaries) from 1987 to 1988 than had been estimated previously.
However, much of the surprise remains unexplained. Some part of it likely
reflects transitory shifts in the timing of realizations of income, induced
by the phasing in of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA), while another part
may reflect larger revenue gains than had been anticipated from TRA's
base-broadening provisions or a shift of the form in which income is
received, from corporate to personal, as relative tax rates have changed.
Revenue growth in the 1986-to-88 phase-in period had been very uneven but,
on average, already had been relatively strong as base-broadening, and the
acceleration of capital gains realizations before the new law became
effective, offset some of the revenue losses from TRA's reductions in
personal income tax rates. Growth in both social insurance and corporate
profits taxes slackened in 1989. This slowing followed two years when a
jump in the social security tax rate and TRA's revenue-raising changes in
corporate taxes had prompted receipts growth in these categories that was
well above trend. Corporate tax receipts also were slowed in the last
fiscal year by the deterioration in overall profitability.
On the outlay side of the budget, total spending in FY89 was raised by
sizable increases in net interest payments, social security and defense
spending. Interest on the debt increased sharply, as outstanding securities
rolled over at higher interest rates through most of the year, while debt
continued to grow. Growth in social security payments maintained recent
II-A-1

II-A-2
trends (the apparent acceleration from the FY86-88 average growth reflects
the indexation of benefits for inflation, which was 4.2 percent last year
compared with 4.1 and 1.3 percent in the two preceding years). The shift of
about $3 billion of military pay from the first of October (a weekend) to
the end of September helped to boost defense outlays. Despite the sizable
contribution of the defense function to total nominal outlay growth, real
spending for defense was about constant, after adjusting for the pay shift.
The budget outcome in FY89 also was influenced by smaller functions or
programs. Outlays for deposit insurance net of premium and other income,
which are typically quite small, soared to $20.6 billion in FY89 after
having amounted to an already sizable $10.2 billion in FY88, as thrift
insurance costs jumped to $17.8 billion in FY89 from $8.1 billion in FY88.
The FY89 total reflected both a surge of FSLIC note issuance at the end of
calendar 1988 (the first quarter of FY89) and $9.0 billion of Treasury-
financed RTC spending under FIRREA in August and September. The RTC
spending, nevertheless, fell considerably below the $18.8 billion (net) that
had been authorized by the law; most of the remaining funds appear to have
been spent in October.
In the high priority areas of science and space, education, health and
criminal justice spending accelerated further in 1989. Outlays for income
security (largely the means tested entitlements) and for energy and natural
resources also picked up last year, but only to a relatively moderate pace.
Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of growth in agricul-
tural spending; the sharp upswing in subsidy payments associated with the
1988 drought was spread across two fiscal years and was counterbalanced, to
some degree, by declines in CCC inventories as the drought raised the level
of market prices relative to support prices. Spending for international
affairs also continued to decline last year.
Owing largely to the restraint on growth of receipts that occurred
during the phase-in of TRA and the surge in thrift-related spending, FY89
marks the third consecutive year in which the deficit has been stalled in
the neighborhood of $150 billion. And it has edged down only slowly as a
percent of GNP over that period, falling from 3.4 percent in 1987 to 2.9
percent last year (chart). Abstracting from the effects of TRA on the
receipts side of the budget and removing certain transitory (largely
financial) or purely accounting changes in outlays (e.g. financial asset
sales, RTC's FY89 on-budget spending, short-term shifts in the timing of
outlays, and movement of some activities to off-budget status) yields an
adjusted deficit, also presented in the chart, which shows a significant and
somewhat smoother improvement throughout the 1985-89 period. However,
progress on permanent deficit reduction is expected to be somewhat slower in
1990 (see the adjusted deficit on the chart). The staff is assuming that
the sequester now in effect will be repealed. The reconciliation bill that
will take its place is thought likely to provide for somewhat less permanent
deficit reduction than either the sequester or the deficit-reducing measures
of some recent years. Meanwhile, apart from deficit-reduction and TRA
effects, receipts growth slows.

II-A-3
Current estimates of the federal deficit on an NIPA basis show slightly
greater improvement than in the budget-basis deficit since 1987, with the
deficit as a percent of GNP falling from 3.8 percent to 2.9 percent.
Indeed, the movements of the NIPA deficit are somewhat similar to the
adjusted deficit because financial transactions such as sales of financial
assets, and FSLIC notes and RTC outlays are excluded from the GNP accounts.
A substantial amount of the remaining, NIPA-basis growth in federal sector
expenditures in recent years reflects the built-in increases in social
insurance and net interest accounts, while autonomous increases, especially
in defense have slowed. Thus, the staff's NIPA-based measure of autonomous
fiscal policy shows a shift from stimulation over the early and mid-1980s to
a neutral or a moderately restraining stance in 1988 and 1989.
Nevertheless, although the federal deficit in NIPA terms has fallen
significantly relative both to GNP and to saving--from about 70 percent of
net domestic nonfederal saving in the 1985-87 period to about half of such
saving in the past two years--the deficit-to-saving ratio remains very high
in contrast to the 15 percent average from 1965 through 1985. Furthermore,
as with the adjusted budget-basis deficit, progress in deficit reduction
seems likely to slow on an NIPA basis in 1990 because of the nature of the
deficit reduction planned in last spring's Bipartisan Budget Agreement.
The Bipartisan Budget Agreement set levels of spending for defense and
international affairs, capped the total for nondefense discretionary
programs, and provided for stricter tax enforcement. It also called for
some additional user fees, an increase of $5.3 billion in general revenues,
and spending reductions generally expected to come largely from savings in
Medicare, agriculture and federal employee retirement, and from asset sales
and placing the Postal Service off budget. As much as half of this deficit
reduction has been thought likely to come from accounting or transitory
savings; furthermore, the shift of some military pay into FY89 permits that
much additional defense spending for other purposes in FY90.
Appropriations appear to be generally in line with the agreement, which
anticipated little reduction of broad spending aggregates from a zero-real-
growth baseline. However, since the agreement, new spending addressed to
the drug problem is only partially offset by reductions in other outlays,
and the additional funds provided for disaster relief after the California
earthquake will be a net addition to the budget and deficit. Currently, only
three of the 13 regular appropriations bills have been enacted; controversy
over the other bills is related largely to nonbudgetary provisions and many
of the remaining bills are now in the final stages of the legislative
process.
The rest of the agreement was to be implemented in a reconciliation
bill. That bill, as passed by the House of Representatives, contained a
number of extraneous and highly controversial provisions (including a cut in
the capital gains tax, repeal of catastrophic health insurance under
1. The estimate of the deficit for the fiscal year on an NIPA basis
includes a staff estimate of corporate profits tax liability for 1989Q3
because this estimate is not yet available from BEA.

II-A-4
Medicare, repeal of "Section 89" tax provisions aimed at preventing
discrimination in tax-exempt employer provided fringe benefits, and a
package of child care benefits). Many of these and other measures were
stripped from the Senate bill and the enactment of the final bill now awaits
the achievement of a conference agreement between the two houses. The
President has decided not to press capital gains tax reductions at this time
and is urging a strengthened deficit reduction package, providing more
permanent measures to reduce spending and free of extraneous provisions.
The outcome of this process is uncertain at present.
Because the reconciliation bill was not passed before the deadline for
the final sequester report that was issued on October 16, a sequester went
into effect at that time. The sequester provides for an across-the-board
cut in spending totalling $16 billion, in order to achieve the Gramm-
Rudman-Hollings target for the estimated FY90 deficit of $100 billion. The
sequester reduces defense spending authority by 4.3 percent and nonexempt,
nondefense spending authority by 5.3 percent. This sequester order will be
repealed if a reconciliation bill is enacted sometime in the next few weeks.
(There is precedent for such action in legislation passed late in 1987
pertaining to FY88.) However, if agreement between the two houses of
Congress and with the administration cannot be reached, the sequester will
remain in place.
The primary difference between these two situations is in the
composition of deficit reduction and the permanence of its effects. The
reconciliation bill, as passed by either house of Congress, provided for
one-time asset sales that would not count toward achieving the Gramm-
Rudman-Hollings target, and from some accounting and timing changes as noted
above, none of which would affect the NIPA federal deficit. In addition,
some of the tax and spending provisions would not reduce deficits in future
years. The sequester would reduce discretionary spending directly with most
of the effects also reducing the NIPA deficit, and the associated reductions
in appropriations would establish a lower base for FY91. In the meantime,
enactment of the remaining appropriations bills can affect either the
aggregate amount or the composition of spending only marginally. However,
whether or not there is a sequester in place, other legislation can be
enacted that would cause the deficit to rise above the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
target, if a waiver is obtained in the House of Representatives, if 60 votes
are available in the Senate to override a point of order, and if the
President signs the bills. And, of course, automatic spending increases or
revenue shortfalls can cause the ultimate deficit outcome to exceed the
target.
2. Repeal of Section 89 is attached to the increase in the debt ceiling to
be signed by the President on November 8. Repeal or modification of
catastrophic health insurance is expected to be enacted as a separate bill.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates generally have declined roughly 1/4 to 1/2 of a
percentage point since the October FOMC meeting, while the October 13 plunge
in the stock market has left share prices appreciably lower. Accompanying
the easing in the federal funds rate from around 9 percent to 8-1/2 percent
most recently, most other money market rates have fallen on net by about
the same amount. In longer-term markets, rates on higher-quality issues
have tended to decline the most, as something of a flight to quality
developed in response to the midmonth drop in the stock market and the
continued volatility in both equity and junk bond markets.
Major stock price indexes, which reached record highs early in the
intermeeting period, have fallen 6 percent since the October 3 meeting,
partly in response to reports of weak third-quarter earnings and to
diminished prospects for LBOs and other highly leveraged restructurings.
Junk bond prices have been similarly affected, with tiering in that market
becoming more pronounced.
The shakeout in the thrift industry continued to affect monetary flows
in October. Deposit growth at thrifts and commercial banks diverged
further, affected by deposit transfers associated with the sale of RTC-
controlled thrifts to banks. The thrift industry experienced a net outflow
of retail-type deposits last month and continued to pay down wholesale
liabilities. Banks, however, saw a pickup in retail deposit flows, and they
stepped up their issuance of managed liabilities to fund stronger bank
credit. As a result of the more rapid expansion of bank balance sheets in
October, M3 growth rebounded to a 5 percent rate. M2 continued to grow at

close to its brisker third-quarter rate, buoyed last month by an
acceleration of M1.
Overall credit demands of the nonfinancial sectors in October appear to
have been broadly in line with the firmer pace of recent months. Business
borrowing likely firmed; nonfinancial corporations increased their issuance
of bonds, including junk bonds. Treasury borrowing rose sharply at the end
of the month, reflecting accelerated issuance related to the debt ceiling.
On a month-average basis, however, growth of federal government borrowing
appears to have ebbed some from its advanced August-September pace.
Borrowing by state and local governments moderated last month, while
available evidence on household borrowing points to no major change in the
growth of mortgages or consumer credit.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 expanded at an 8 percent rate in October, in line with September's
growth, and climbed further toward the midpoint of its annual target range.
Growth in this aggregate was fueled by strength in its liquid components,
including a sharp rise in M1 growth to a 10 percent rate. In recent months,
the composition of M2 has shifted more toward the liquid components in
response to a narrowing of the yield differential between small time and
liquid retail deposits (chart).
The surge in M1 in October was paced by large inflows to demand
deposits at the beginning of the month, which may have reflected higher
compensating balance requirements owing to the lower average level of market
interest rates in recent months. A similar phenomenon was observed at the
beginning of last quarter. The rapid growth of demand deposits last month
does not appear to have been related to the October 13 fall in stock prices,

as the data display only a relatively small and brief increase around that
date. Inflows to general-purpose and broker-dealer money funds reacted more
strongly to the turmoil in the stock and junk bond markets. A midmonth
bulge buoyed growth of money funds nevertheless, the 27 percent rate of
expansion of this component represented a deceleration from the pace of
previous months which had been boosted sharply by aggressive promotional
efforts of a few funds.
Total small time deposits were again little changed in October, but
this stability masked a 9 percent rate of decline in such deposits at
thrifts, offset by strong inflows at commercial banks. Much of this
divergence was caused by the closure of four large thrifts by the RTC in
October, and the transfer of their roughly $5 billion in deposits to
commercial banks. Thrift deposits also were pulled down by RTC advances,
which replaced maturing high-cost brokered funds at intervened institutions.
Savings deposits and MMDAs continued to grow at about a 7 percent rate;
these flows, too, were skewed toward commercial banks, albeit less markedly
than small time deposits.
M3 growth picked up to a 5 percent rate in October, keeping this
aggregate just above the lower bound of its target range. The strengthening
of M3 mainly reflected stronger issuance at commercial banks of large time
deposits used to finance an acceleration of credit. Managed liabilities at
thrifts, on the other hand, continued to run off at about the pace of the
previous few months as insolvent institutions were sold off by the RTC and
thinly capitalized ones likely continued their efforts to pare balance
sheets.

Bank credit growth accelerated to a 13 percent rate in October,
primarily stemming from a sharp increase in acquisitions of government
securities--particularly federally related mortgage-backed securities--and a
pickup in business loans. To a minor extent, the strength in securities may
reflect the investment of cash provided by the RTC to the commercial banks
that bought intervened thrifts. Bolstered by business lending, total loan
growth increased to a 10 percent pace last month. However, merger-related
financings, which had been the source of the growth in C&I loans this year,
appear to have been curtailed, as banks reportedly have become more cautious
about LBO-related lending, as evidenced by the failed UAL Corporation
buyout. Consumer loans on banks' balance sheets increased more slowly than
in the prior two months, but preliminary data suggest this slowdown may
merely represent an increase in loan securitization. Real estate lending by
banks edged down in October to a pace slightly below its average for this
year, suggesting that, to the extent that banks have been replacing thrifts
in the mortgage arena, many did so primarily through the indirect means of
mortgage securities last month.
Business Finance
The stronger business loan growth at domestic banking offices in
October was partially offset by loan runoffs at foreign offices. Combining
these loan totals with weak issuance of commercial paper by nonfinancial
firms implies another month of little or no growth in this measure of short-
and intermediate-term business credit. Borrowing in long-term credit
markets, however, evidently rose significantly, responding to the decline in
interest rates. Bond offerings by nonfinancial firms totaled $8 billion,

the largest monthly volume since May when the total was inflated by the RJR
financing.
Most major stock price indexes rose to all-time highs on October 9,
then, on Friday the 13th, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190
points, initially reacting to financing problems with the buyout of UAL
Corporation. Except for the transportation indexes, most broad market
indexes regained about one-third of their Friday losses early the next week,
but have since declined in the wake of generally weak third-quarter earnings
reports. Stocks perceived to be takeover candidates have suffered
significantly larger price declines than the broad market averages since
October 12. The market has continued to be plagued by high volatility, much
of it related to weak earnings reports and changing market perceptions about
the prospects for merger transactions. Nevertheless, gross nonfinancial
equity issuance for October was a robust $1.5 billion--the highest level in
more than a year--and was well-maintained after the stock market dropped.
With the UAL Corporation buyout unlikely to occur this year, net equity
retirements are expected to fall in the fourth quarter to around an annual
rate of $85 billion, the lowest quarter since 1987.
The prices of shares in property and casualty insurance companies were
little affected on balance by recent natural disasters, as insured losses
did not seem likely to threaten solvency or liquidity, and market
participants anticipated improved prospects for obtaining premium increases.
Similarly, the share prices of large California thrift institutions and
banks with substantial real estate loan exposure in the Bay area showed
little reaction to the October 17 earthquake.

The mid-October selloff in the stock market triggered some of the
circuit breakers put in place after the October 1987 crash: Standard and
Poor's index futures hit two price limits, and the NYSE invoked a procedure
that separates program trades in the order flow. Few problems were
encountered in the clearing and settlement areas, although two small option-
trading firms required regulatory intervention. Subsequently, attention has
focused on continuing volatility and proposals to curtail program trading.
Deterioration in the high-yield bond market has continued, as the
spread between junk bonds and 10-year Treasury securities has widened about
65 basis points further since late September. Higher-grade junk bonds have
continued to outperform the rest of the junk bond market. Reportedly, the
acceleration of the already heavy redemptions from junk bond mutual funds
since October 13 has been accommodated to date by liquid asset cushions and
without significant liquidation of junk bonds by the funds. High-yield bond
issuance by nonfinancial companies since the stock market selloff has
remained heavy, mostly in better quality issues, bringing the total for
October to $3.1 billion--the highest since May.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
Treasury financing was disrupted by a drop in the debt ceiling on
November 1. In anticipation of the decline in the ceiling, the Treasury
accelerated the settlement of weekly bill auctions that otherwise would have
been issued in the first week of November, and it auctioned a small cash
management bill. The Treasury announced a $30 billion midquarter refunding
and a $10 billion cash management bill to settle on November 15, contingent
on debt ceiling legislation. On November 6, the Treasury postponed its
weekly bill auctions, but when the debt ceiling was increased to $3.12

III-12
trillion on November 8--one day before the government would have run out of
cash--the Treasury announced its intentions to complete the auctions on a
compressed schedule.
The staff anticipates a fourth-quarter federal deficit of more than $79
billion, which will be financed by $59 billion of borrowing from the public
and by drawing down the Treasury's cash balance. The increase in borrowing
relative to last quarter is again expected to take place primarily in the
bill sector. Since the beginning of the third quarter, the gross size of
weekly bill auctions has been increased in steps from $13.2 billion to the
current level of $16.0 billion. These increases were prompted by the thrift
bailout, as well as by the usual seasonal swing in financing needs, which
typically is accommodated largely by a stepup in bill issuance. Still
another factor behind the increases in gross auction sizes is the sharp drop
in add-ons so far this year. Add-ons--representing additional issuance
outside of the auction process, primarily to foreign central banks, have
dwindled. The gross size of Treasury coupon auctions also is expected to be
boosted--likely by $250 million to $500 million--during the fourth quarter.
The total debt of the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) increased
relatively little in the third quarter, though changes in the distribution
reflected turmoil in the thrift sector. The dramatic falloff in Federal
Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances to thrifts led to a corresponding paydown of
more than $10 billion in FHLB debt during the period. By contrast, Fannie
Mae raised more than $5 billion of new cash in the debt market, which was
primarily used to finance a $4 billion increase in its portfolio of mortgage
assets.

III-13
In the fourth quarter, the most notable event in the GSE market has
been the initial issue by the Resolution Funding Corporation. REFCORP,
which was created by FIRREA to help finance the liquidation of insolvent
thrifts, auctioned $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds on October 25. The auction
average rate was 8.15 percent, 28 basis points above the yield on the
comparable Treasury issue and, roughly in line with expectations. The yield
spread was roughly half that on FICO bonds sold in September, largely
reflecting the stronger federal protection attached to REFCORP bonds.
REFCORP is expected to come to market with similar issues on a quarterly
basis until it exhausts its $30 billion borrowing authority.
In a related market, the Tennessee Valley Authority priced $4 billion
of so-called Power Bonds on October 17. This public offering marks a
significant departure of the funding of wholly owned federal agencies from
the pattern followed since the establishment of the Federal Financing Bank
(FFB) in 1973. Prior to the formation of the FFB, all agencies borrowed on
their own in the market, resulting in a crowded calendar and some confusion
as to whose debt carried the full faith and credit backing of the U.S.
government and whose did not. The FFB provided attractive financing for the
wholly owned agencies by charging them a spread of only 12.5 basis points
over similar Treasury securities. These new TVA bonds do not carry the full
faith and credit of the Treasury, but the short-term maturities were priced
at spreads similar to those on FHLB issues, about 45 basis points over
Treasuries. TVA undertook this borrowing to pay off debt to the FFB
incurred at the much higher interest rates prevailing in the early 1980s.

III-14
Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term municipal securities slowed to $8 billion
in October. Both new capital and refunding volume fell, as interest rates
on tax-exempt obligations remained above those at the end of the summer.
Since May, the overall decline in rates on municipal bonds has fallen short
of that on high-grade corporate and Treasury bonds. As a result, the ratio
of the municipal bond yield to the 30-year Treasury yield has risen from a
low of 0.84 in May to its current level of 0.95. In part, the increase may
reflect reduced demands for tax-exempt securities by money center banks,
whose appetite for tax-exempt income probably has diminished as another
round of sizable LDC-related loss provisions has greatly reduced expected
future tax liabilities.

Prices of northern California issues fell slightly after the
earthquake, but recovered after rating agencies indicated that they do not
anticipate significant credit deterioration on these issues. Yields on New
York City bonds, however, recently have risen about 65 basis points amid
concerns over the city's revenue shortfall.
Mortgage Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting, yields on conventional fixed-rate
mortgages (FRMs) have declined 30 to 40 basis points, roughly in line with
comparable Treasury securities. Initial rates on adjustable-rate mortgages
(ARMs) indexed to the one-year constant maturity Treasury yield, meanwhile,
have declined just 15 basis points, further narrowing the initial rate
advantage of ARMs. This narrow spread and the general decline in fixed-rate
mortgages have been reflected in a large FRM share of conventional home
mortgage closings, as many homebuyers have opted for FRMs and a sizable
volume of ARMs have been refinanced into FRMs. According to the OTS monthly
survey of major institutional lenders, which does not include refinancing,
roughly 75 percent of all conventional home loans closed in recent months
have carried fixed rates, the largest share since the spring of 1987.
Data on loan pricing suggest that lenders have continued to offer ARMs
at discounted initial rates; nonetheless, the overall prevalence of
discounted loans has declined from levels seen earlier in the year. In the
most recent OTS survey, 55 percent of ARMs closed in early September carried
teaser rates, with an average discount in excess of 200 basis points
(table). However, in some cases, the initial advantage is offset by higher
margins after the discount expires. Unless ARM lenders become more

aggressive in pricing loans or unless interest rates rise, borrower
preferences for FRMs are likely to be sustained over the near-term.
With the ARM share of gross loan originations low and thrifts
attempting to trim asset growth to meet capital requirements, thrift
mortgage lending activity has been subdued. This summer marked the first
time in the 19-year history of HUD's quarterly survey that thrifts failed to
account for the largest share of new mortgage loan originations, being
surpassed by commercial banks. Data for August point to a modest pickup in
thrift mortgage origination activity; mortgage originations at SAIF-insured
institutions increased for the first time since early spring, while new
commitments to originate loans increased for a second month.
Thrifts, however, have continued to pace their holding of mortgage
assets as part of their efforts to shrink their balance sheets to satisfy
impending capital requirements. Thrift mortgage asset holdings declined
$12.2 billion in August, including a record $9.8 billion drop in holdings of
mortgage pass-through securities, and assets likely continued to run off in
September and October. Thrift asset flows in recent months have tracked a
funding proxy, comprising the combined flow of total deposits, FHLB
advances, and repurchase agreements (chart). In September, this funding
proxy declined at a 16.5 percent annual rate, consistent with perhaps a $15
billion reduction in total thrift assets, and preliminary data for October
suggest a continued, just slightly smaller, contraction in assets.
With FRMs accounting for three-quarters of all conventional mortgage
originations in recent months, issuance of federally related pass-through
securities has accelerated and is now running well ahead of the pace
earlier in the year. There was heavy packaging of these assets into CMOs

and other REMIC securities in the third quarter, and trade reports indicate
that large issuance of CMOs continued through October, as FNMA and FHLMC
repackaged more than $8 billion of their own guaranteed pass-throughs into
derivative securities last month. Notable among recent offerings is a $201
million FNMA REMIC security underwritten by Nomura Securities and marketed
directly to Japanese investors, which reportedly went well. Spreads on
mortgage-backed securities, measured by the GNMA current coupon yield,
relative to 10-year Treasuries, have narrowed by about 10 basis points since
the October FOMC meeting, despite reports of continued heavy mortgage asset
liquidations by thrifts.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding edged up at a 1 percent annual
rate in September after expanding at a 5 percent rate in August. Consumer
credit growth, which has been volatile from month to month, has been
slowing, on balance, for much of this year. In the first half, credit
growth generally tracked movements in consumer spending. In the third
quarter, however, credit expansion fell short of growth in spending--
particularly for automobiles. Auto credit outstanding declined 3-1/2
percent (annual rate) during the quarter. In part, the apparent weakness in
auto credit may be the result of problems with seasonal adjustment arising
from the 1985 and 1986 interest rate incentive programs which sharply
boosted sales and credit in August and September in those years, causing
seasonal adjustment factors to anticipate a similar advance this year.
Also, some buyers may be paying for new autos by drawing on home equity
lines (classified as mortgage credit) as was evidenced in two surveys of
consumers taken last year, while trade reports suggest that some others may

be leasing instead of buying autos. Leasing results in a sale by the dealer
with no corresponding increase in consumer credit. Both alternatives to the
standard auto loan have become more attractive in recent years because of
the gradual elimination of tax deductibility for personal interest expenses.
Activity in the consumer asset-backed securities market continued
strong in the third quarter, with public placement of 13 issues totalling
$3.1 billion; another seven private placements were announced totalling $2.3
billion. Volume was dominated in the third quarter, as it has been all
year, by sales of credit card receivables. For the first three quarters,
credit cards have accounted for a total of $7.8 billion in securitizations,
with Citicorp and Sears responsible for the bulk of the activity. The third
quarter also saw a slight pickup in securities backed by auto loans as
several issues by banks totaled about $750 million. The captive auto
finance companies were absent from the public market during the first three
quarters of this year; however, Ford Motor Credit offered $3.05 billion of
auto-backed securities in October, its first such issue. In total, through
the first three quarters of 1989, there were 33 public issues amounting to
$10.8 billion--compared with 28 issues amounting to $8.1 billion over the
same period in 1988.
Securitization activity is usually quite heavy in the fourth quarter of
the year as lenders attempt to clean up their books. This year the usual
year-end incentives will be augmented by the move to tougher capital
standards for banks and savings institutions. Consumer loans will be in the
100 percent category for risk-based capital purposes, compared with mortgage
loans in the 50 percent category; thus, there is more incentive to remove
consumer loans from the books. Based on recent experience, S&Ls may find it

III-24
more profitable to sell off whole credit card portfolios than to securitize
them; there were very sizable sales by such institutions in both June and
September.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. Merchandise Trade
The deficit on U.S. merchandise trade worsened in August to $10.8
billion (on a seasonally adjusted, Census basis, customs valuation),
from an upwardly revised $8.2 billion deficit in July. The August trade
balance was the largest monthly deficit recorded so far this year. A
surge in the value of non-oil imports was largely responsible for the
deterioration in August, as total exports and oil imports were about
unchanged from July. Declines in the average price of non-oil imports
following the appreciation of the dollar over much of this year appear
to have stimulated the demand for these imports.

On a seasonally adjusted balance-of-payments basis, the value of
exports declined only slightly between the second quarter and the July-
August average. This decline can be traced largely to a drop-off in
agricultural shipments, particularly wheat and corn to the Soviet Union,
from the high levels registered during the first half of this year.
Nonagricultural exports rose slightly in July-August as a decline
in shipments of automotive products to Canada was more than offset by
increased deliveries of civilian aircraft. Exports of aircraft during
the fourth quarter are expected to be substantially lower than shipments
in July-August, owing to the strike at Boeing. Declines in the price of
exports (discussed below) and continued strong growth abroad stimulated
the quantity of nonagricultural exports, which rose by over 2 percent
between the second quarter and July-August.
The value of imports increased more than 2 percent in July-August
from their level in the second quarter, due to a surge in imports of
non-oil products. The July-August increase was primarily in consumer
goods and machinery, with smaller increases in other categories. Demand
for consumer goods was relatively robust in the third quarter. All of
the growth of non-oil imports was in quantity terms, as prices declined
on average over this period.
The quantity of imported oil rose substantially further in August,
marking the highest monthly rate since February of 1980. The bulk of
these imports was crude petroleum, rather than petroleum products. Most
of the increase in imports went into domestic stocks, as consumption
remained about unchanged. Weekly data suggest that the quantity of oil

imports declined only slightly in September and October despite higher
prices in both spot and posted markets.

Import and Export Prices
As reported by the BLS, the average price of U.S. imports declined
more than 5 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, reflecting
declines in the prices of both oil and non-oil products. Oil prices
dropped almost 30 percent at an annual rate, reversing some of the
increase recorded in the first half of this year. The average price of
non-oil imports declined for the second consecutive quarter, owing
partly to the effects of the appreciation of the dollar this year.
Large declines were registered for the prices of imported foods and
industrial materials in the third quarter, while prices of other
categories of imports were essentially unchanged.
Export prices also declined on average in the third quarter, by
almost 3 percent at an annual rate. The decline was largely
attributable to falling agricultural prices. Prices of nonagricultural
exports declined only slightly on average, as a drop in the prices of
industrial materials outweighed modest increases in other categories.
Export prices of most industrial materials have fallen steadily since
early this year. The declines have been in excess of declines in

comparable domestic prices, possibly in response to the appreciation of
the dollar. On the other hand, prices of capital goods appear to have
been less sensitive to movements in dollar exchange rates. Since the
beginning of the year, prices of exports of capital goods have risen
fairly steadily and have moved in tandem with their counterparts in the
Producer Price Index, suggesting that producers of capital goods allow
the foreign-currency prices of their products to vary along with the
dollar.
Beginning with the second quarter, the BEA uses primarily the price
information provided by BLS in formulating estimates for export and
import prices in the GNP accounts. Unit value indexes, previously used
to measure the prices of industrial materials and foods, are no longer
available.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
In August U.S. net capital inflows for which data are available
totaled over $31 billion (lines 1 through 5 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table) -- roughly three times the U.S. trade
deficit in that month. These monthly data, and the implied statistical
discrepancy, tend to be volatile. Combining the August figure with the
recorded $1 billion inflow in July yields a figure much more in line
with the likely magnitude of the current account deficit plus net direct
investment inflows.
Recorded private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities
totaled $11-3/4 billion in August (line 3). This was more than
accounted for by net purchases of bonds and notes. These large net
purchases coincided with the Treasury's mid-quarter refunding and

reflect the increasing tendency of foreigners to purchase Treasury
securities at or around the auction dates. Over the past eighteen
months changes in the monthly pattern of the Treasury's net borrowing
from the public has "explained" more than half of the monthly variation
in foreign net purchases of Treasuries. As foreign investors have
become larger participants in the market for Treasuries, and the size of
their transactions has increased, their bids have had a larger effect on
the market price. Because of their market impact, foreigners have
tended to bid at the auction directly or to purchase in the relatively
active markets immediately following the auction when large orders are
less apt to move the market.
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States rose by almost
$10 billion in August (line 4) with large net inflows attributed to G-10
countries and OPEC. Most of the inflow probably reflected a shifting
out of Eurodollar deposits into Treasury securities as the spread
between Eurodeposit and Treasury rates declined.

IV-9
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks and bonds declined
modestly in August (lines 2a and 2b of the Summary table) as did private
U.S. purchases of foreign securities (line 2c). New Eurobond issues by
U.S. corporations, which were depressed in August, picked up again in
September.
The Summary table shows large net inflows through banking in August
(line 1). However, as shown on the International Banking Table on the
following page, net claims of U.S. banking offices on their own foreign
offices declined by about $1 billion in August and $2 billion in
September. The data in the International Banking Table, which are
monthly averages and treat IBF's as outside the U.S. domestic banking
system, tend to be much less erratic than the month-end data used for
banking in the Summary table.
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the October 3 FOMC meeting, the trade-weighted, foreign
exchange value of the dollar against the other G-10 currencies declined
on balance about 1-1/4 percent. Early in the period, the dollar rose
about 1-3/4 percent, despite a round of interest rate increases in
Europe, the release of weaker-than-expected U.S. employment data, a
surprise discount-rate increase in Japan, and continued,
A factor temporarily
contributing to the dollar's rise was the market's misinterpretation of
statements by Chairman Greenspan in the Soviet Union, which were viewed
as criticism of U.S. intervention operations at that time. After

reaching highs of DM1.9225 and ¥145.10 on October 11, the dollar
reversed course amid increases in market interest rates in Germany and
Japan in anticipation of further tightening and perceptions that the
Federal Reserve was adopting an easier monetary policy stance,
particularly after the selloff in U.S. stocks two days later.
Subsequently, the dollar continued to decline, prodded by narrowing
interest-rate differentials and by the release of data showing a larger-
than-expected U.S. trade deficit in August.
The dollar's performance over the intermeeting period was not
uniform against individual currencies. The dollar strengthened about
1-3/8 percent against the yen but weakened about 2-3/8 percent against
the mark and the other EMS currencies. The differential movement of the
dollar against the yen and the mark appears to have been caused by a
perception that the Bundesbank is prepared to move aggressively against
inflation and to strengthen the mark while the Japanese authorities are
perceived as more reluctant to use monetary policy for these purposes.
Against sterling the dollar firmed about 1 percent over the
intermeeting period. Sterling suffered two bouts of downward pressure
during the period. The first occurred just prior to the announcement of
official interest rate increases in Germany. The increases in German
rates were widely anticipated, but it was felt that the United Kingdom
would not move in step with Germany because U.K. interest rates were
already so high and its economy was nearing recession. Sterling
recovered briefly after the U.K. authorities announced a full
percentage-point increase, matching Germany's increases, but then
weakened again as market attention shifted to prospects for recession in

the United Kingdom. The second bout of downward pressure occurred after
the surprise resignation of Nigel Lawson as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Since that time, sterling has
recovered somewhat to DM2.92.
The accompanying table details the increases in interest rates in
Germany and other countries since October 3. The Bundesbank raised its
discount and Lombard rates 1 percentage point each on October 6,
prompting similar increases elsewhere in Europe. There was little
immediate reaction to the increases in Germany because they were largely
anticipated, but short-term interest rates there have since moved up
another 35 basis points in anticipation of further tightening. One week
after the European increases, the Bank of Japan surprised the market
with a 1/2 percentage-point increase in its discount rate on October 11;
market interest rates moved up sharply immediately following the
announcement and have risen further since then.
Stock prices worldwide declined following the selloff in the United
States on October 13. The table shows changes in stock indices since
the date of the previous FOMC. Japan's stock prices are above their
levels just before the stock decline, having returned close to their
levels at the beginning of the period, while prices in the United
Kingdom have recovered only slightly and prices in Germany and France
have declined even further. During this period of turbulence in
financial markets, the price of gold rose 5 percent to $384 per ounce.

The Desk sold $770 million against yen and $390 million against
marks. The Desk's activity was concentrated during the first two weeks
of the period when the dollar was rising; since October 12, before the
stock slide, the Desk has conducted no operations for the accounts of
the System or the Treasury.
U.S. Bank Lending to Foreigners
U.S.-chartered banks' cross-border claims on foreign borrowers
increased by $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 1989. Increases in
claims on G-10 countries, smaller developed countries, and offshore
banking centers were almost completely offset by a decline in claims on
non-OPEC developing countries, OPEC, and Eastern European countries.
The decline in U.S. bank claims on non-OPEC developing
countries was largely accounted for by a decline in claims on Argentina
and Mexico. Reported claims on Argentina declined because U.S. banks
wrote off some of their long-term public sector claims on Argentina in
response to a regulatory decision to require reserves against Argentine
exposure. The decline in Mexican claims held by U.S. banks is more
closely accounted for by secondary market sales of such claims to other
investors.
U.S. bank claims on G-10 countries increased by $3.1 billion in
the second quarter of 1989, largely reflecting an increase in claims on
borrowers in France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, possibly
reflecting decisions by U.S. banks to participate in financing corporate
restructurings in Europe. Claims on East European countries declined
$0.3 billions, largely because of a decline in claims on the Soviet

Union and Yugoslavia, and U.S. banks continue to account for less than 5
percent of total bank claims on East Europe.
As indicated in the following table and chart, secondary market
prices of bank loans to the heavily indebted countries on average
changed relatively little over the second and third quarters of 1989
with a large decline in the price of Brazilian debt offset by increases
in the prices of other countries' debts. In October, secondary market
prices have fallen for Brazilian, Mexican and other developing-country
debt. The recent weakness in the secondary market prices of developing-
country debt in part reflects concerns by participants that the choices
by lenders under the Mexican restructuring agreement will result in a
selection for debt and debt-service reductions in excess of the funds
available to enhance those two options. Failure to implement a debt
restructuring for Mexico would make it difficult to achieve progress for
other countries under the Brady i .itiative.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
The slower pace of economic activity reflected in second-quarter
GDP growth in the major foreign industrial countries appears to have
continued in the third quarter. Monthly indicators of economic
activity, such as industrial production, remained relatively flat during
the third quarter. Germany appears to be an exception to this trend,
with several indicators showing a rebound.
Recent trends in inflation have not been uniform across countries.
Consumer price inflation in Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom edged
up slightly in September and October, reflecting, to some extent,

earlier weakness in their respective currencies. In Italy and Canada,
inflation rates declined from recent summer peaks which were associated
with the introduction of indirect taxes.
Progress in external adjustment has been mixed. In Japan, and to
a lesser extent Germany, trade and current account surpluses have
narrowed from levels registered earlier in the year. In contrast,
external imbalances in France, Canada, and the United Kingdom worsened.
Italy was the only deficit country that showed some improvement,
registering a third-quarter trade deficit significantly below the record
first-quarter level.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, preliminary third quarter
data suggest relatively weak economic activity. As shown in the table
below, industrial production declined 2 percent (s.a.) in September, and
for the third quarter as a whole was only 0.2 percent above its second-
quarter level. Retail sales declined by 1.8 percent (s.a.) in August,
following increases of over 2 percent in the previous two months. The
rate of capacity utilization fell by 3.8 percent in July, though it
remains at an historically very high level. The unemployment rate edged
back down to 2.2 percent (s.a.) in September.

Recent monthly data show further increases in inflation rates.
The consumer price index for Tokyo increased by 1 percent (n.s.a.) in
October, to a level 3.3 percent above that of a year earlier. Wholesale
prices in September registered a 3.3 percent increase from their level a
year earlier. Over this period, prices of domestic goods were up 2.7
percent while import prices jumped by 8.3 percent. These inflation
developments, and weakness in the yen, were factors in the Bank of Japan's
October 11 decision to raise the discount rate by 1/2 percentage point to
3-3/4 percent.
The trade surplus increased in September. However, the
cumulative trade surplus over the first three quarters was $70 billion
(s.a.a.r.), below the $74 billion surplus over the same period last year.
The current account surplus has shown a greater decline this year, due
mainly to a sharp increase in Japanese tourist expenditures.
On October 1, the ruling Liberal Democrat Party won a legislative
by-election, breaking a string of election defeats. The government has
said that it intends to pass the budget for the coming fiscal year
(beginning next April) before calling for an election of the lower house
of the Diet.
In Germany, monthly data suggest that economic activity rebounded
in the third quarter from its slowdown in the second quarter. Industrial
production fell 0.6 percent (s.a.) in September, but increased in the
third quarter as a whole by 2.1 percent from its second-quarter level.
The volume of manufacturers' new orders increased 0.4 percent (s.a.) in
both August and September after a 0.3 percent decline in July; the level
for September was 6.3 percent above that of a year earlier. External

IV-25
demand continues to be the most important source of stimulus. During
August and September, foreign orders increased 3 percent while domestic
orders fell by 1 percent. In the labor market, the unemployment rate
remained at 7.8 percent in both September and October.

Inflation appears to have increased somewhat in September and
October after moderating during the summer. Consumer prices in October
were 3.3 percent (n.s.a.) above their level a year earlier, compared with
3.1 percent in September and 2.9 percent in August. Wholesale prices were
5.5 percent above their year-earlier level in September, up from 4.5
percent in August. The recent rise in inflation is primarily due to the
mark's decline against most major currencies between mid-July and
mid-September, and to this summer's rise in energy prices.

Germany's external surpluses, after setting new records in the first
quarter, have narrowed somewhat. However, on a cumulative basis through
September, the current account surplus was $53 billion (n.s.a.a.r.),
significantly larger than the $44 billion surplus over the same period in
1988. Meanwhile, the cumulative trade surplus over this period was $73
billion (n.s.a.a.r.), slightly above its year-earlier level of $69
billion.
The Bundesbank raised the discount and Lombard rates in the first
week of October by a full percentage point to 6 and 8 percent
respectively, citing as factors strong growth and the potentially
inflationary impact of wage negotiations scheduled for early 1990. This
was the fifth increase in official rates since last December. Growth in
M3 fell back from 5.1 percent in August to 4.6 percent in September
(s.a.a.r., from Q4-1988), and is now below the Bundesbank's target of
"about 5 percent" for 1989.
In France, the average level of industrial production in July and
August increased 0.5 percent (s.a.) from its level in June. The
cumulative trade deficit for the first seven months of 1989 widened to
$6.6 billion (s.a.a.r), from $3.9 billion over the same period last year.
In September, the government announced its 1990 budget; the deficit
is projected to decline to 1.4 percent of GDP next year from 1.7 percent
of GDP in 1989, primarily due to strong revenue growth. The Bank of
France raised official interest rates by 75 basis points on October 5, in
conjunction with actions by other European central banks, primarily to
prevent the emergence of downward pressures on the franc within the EMS.

IV-27
Economic activity in the United Kingdom slackened in the third
quarter. Real consumer spending rose a preliminary 0 1 percent (s.a.) in
the third quarter after a 1.6 perent rise in the second quarter.
Industrial production grew 1.5 percent (s.a.) in August, due, in part, to
a rebound in oil production, but only to a level 0.9 percent above that of
a year earlier. The volume of retail sales rose 0.6 percent (s.a.) in
September and brought the third-quarter average to a level 0.6 percent
below the previous quarter. The unemployment rate fell to a nine-year low
of 6 percent in August.
The consumer price index rose to 7.6 percent (n.s.a.) in September
from its level a year earlier, up from the 7.3 percent increase in August.
Excluding mortgage interest payments, the rise in September was 5.8
percent, down only slightly from the peak of 6 percent in May. Wage
pressures have persisted; the annual rate of increase in average earnings
was 8-3/4 percent in August. The U.K. trade balance improved somewhat in
September, after registering near-record deficits in July and August. The
cumulative deficit was $41 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the nine months through
September compared with a deficit of about $33 billion over the same
period last year.
Nigel Lawson, the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the past 6-1/2
years, resigned on October 26. In his resignation letter, Lawson cited
differences with Thatcher and her economic advisor, Sir Alan Walters (who
also subsequently resigned), over economic policy. Lawson was replaced by
John Major, the Foreign Secretary, who stated that eradicating inflation
would remain the primary policy objective, and that the United Kingdom

IV-28
would enter the EMS when inflation had fallen to the EC average and
capital controls had been removed in the other EMS countries.
In Canada, continued weakness in the pace of economic activity is
suggested by 0.2 percent (s.a.) declines in industrial production in both
June and July. Canada's current account registered a record deficit in
the second quarter of $4.8 billion (s.a.), reflecting the strong Canadian
dollar and continued rapid imports of capital goods. The cumulative trade
surplus (s.a.) through August of this year is about forty percent below
its total during the same period in 1988.
In Italy, the July-August average level of industrial production
(s.a.) did not increase, but still was 2.2 percent above the second
quarter level.
The 1990 budget and accompanying budget legislation were presented
to parliament on September 30. It includes legislative changes designed
to reduce the projected 1990 deficit to 10.4 percent of GDP from 11
percent in 1989. On the expenditure side, it includes cuts and in the
subsidy to employees' social security contributions and to public
corporations. The increase in revenues, which accounts for roughly 2/3 of
the $14 billion deficit reduction, comes from increases in the gasoline
tax, fees for government services, and a reduction in the depreciation
allowance. However the recent failure of a tax amnesty to yield the
expected revenue, and the rapid growth of health expenditures, has
resulted in reports suggesting that these measures may not be sufficient
to attain the 1990 deficit target.

Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Mexico's external accounts and fiscal balance have weakened, while
its economy has shown stronger-tha-expected growth. Commitments on the
Mexican financing package are being collected. With somewhat less than
half of the base debt accounted for, only $500 million in new money had
been pledged by creditor banks by November 7, representing about 9
percent of the base debt committed so far. In Brazil, pre-election
uncertainty has increased inflationary expectations and caused turmoil
in financial markets. Argentina has reached agreement with the IMF on a
proposed 17-month, SDR 1.1 billion stand-by arrangement; the structural
reforms launched by President Menem continue, although at a reduced
pace. Venezuela cleared $920 million in interest arrears to the banks
in early October and has resumed talks with its bank creditors on a
financing package of new money and debt- and debt-service reduction to
support its economic program. The Philippines expects to meet its 1989-
90 financing needs through a proposed package of new money from banks of
about $1.0 billion and the buyback of about $1.3 billion of its $7.2
billion in medium- and long-term bank debt at a 50 percent discount.
Costa Rica and its bank advisory committee reached agreement in
principle on a debt reduction proposal covering both the stock of old
debt and substantial accumulated interest arrears.
Individual country notes. Mexico's external accounts appear to
have deteriorated since late August, amid mounting indications that the
end-year fiscal performance criteria of the IMF program may not be met.
Rising private investment and a recovery of production are likely to
result in 3 percent real GDP growth in 1989, twice the (optimistic)

IV-30
official forecast made last January. The stronger economy, however, is
stimulating imports and diverting potential exports to the home market.
On the fiscal side, in spite of larger-than-expected revenue gains,
the overall deficit is being swollen by supplemental appropriations and
by stubbornly high interest payments on the domestic public debt. While
domestic interest rates fell dramatically in July and August, following
announcement of the agreement reached with Mexico's bank advisory
committee, rates have increased steadily since late August, reflecting
high private and public sector demand for credit. The interest rate on
28-day Treasury bills stood at 38.2 percent on October 31, up from 33
percent on August 29. To counter the fiscal deterioration, selected
public sector prices, notably for rail transport, fertilizer, and
residential electricity, have been raised in recent weeks. But other
public sector prices, such as for gasoline, have not been raised since
the end of 1987. The increases in public sector prices have caused
business to clamor for permission to raise prices that are subject to
control and labor to demand emergency wage increases. Higher gasoline
prices and changes in the policy of devaluing the peso against the
dollar by 1 peso per day are unlikely until a new wage-price pact with
business and labor is concluded; the current pact expires next March.
By November 7, 187 banks, representing $23 billion of the estimated
$52.7 billion base debt to be restructured under Mexico's debt
agreement, had indicated their choice among the three options. Only
eight banks, with $2.1 billion in base debt among them, had opted for
new money, for a total new money commitment of just over $500 million.

IV-31
In Brazil, the government has had only limited success preventing
inflation from rising further before the November 15 presidential
election. Consumer prices rose 38 percent in October, compared with 36
percent in September. In mid-October, the government signed agreements
with representatives of several industries to limit price rises to no
more than 90 percent of the previous month's inflation rate. Recently,
however, producers have been pressing for larger increases. In early
November, financial markets forecast November inflation at 45 percent.
Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks. The spread
between the official and parallel market exchange rates widened from 83
percent September 22 to 105 percent on October 11. After reaching 152
percent October 26, it fell to 102 percent November 6. The fall in the
spread has been accompanied by a rise in domestic interest rates.
Political uncertainty appears to be the main factor behind the rise
in inflation expectations. Twenty-two candidates are running in the
November 15 election. If no candidate wins 50 percent or more of the
vote--as is virtually certain--a runoff between the top two finishers
will be held December 17. The winner will take office in March 1990.
The October 31 entry into the race of Silvio Santos, a popular
television host, adds further uncertainty to an already-clouded
political picture.
Brazil's trade surplus was $1.2 billion in September, bringing the
cumulative surplus for the first nine months of 1989 to $13.2 billion,
compared with $14.7 billion for the comparable period of 1988.
Argentina and the IMF reached agreement in late September on a 17-
month, SDR 1.1 billion stand-by arrangement; the program is scheduled

IV-32
for discussion by the Fund's Executive Directors on November 10. The
program requires Argentina to implement further its plans for structural
reform, which include privatization of public enterprises, elimination
of government subsidies, tax reform, and other measures to restore
fiscal balance. The arrangement also envisages Argentina's normalizing
relations with the commercial banks; the two sides met inconclusively in
early November.
Argentina's program of economic reform has continued to move ahead,
although at a somewhat slower pace in recent weeks. Plans for the
privatization of additional public enterprises have been announced, and
various subsidy programs have been suspended. However, the bill to
overhaul the tax system underwent frequent modifications before its
submission to Congress in late October and may encounter further
resistance during Congressional deliberations. Moreover, the proposed
new charter for the Central Bank, which would enhance its independence
from the government, is stalled as well.
After declining from 197 percent in July to 38 percent in August
9.4 percent in September, monthly inflation fell to 5.6 percent in
October. Partially in response to September's inflation rate, which was
somewhat higher than expected, the parallel market exchange rate, which
had stabilized at or below the official rate of 650 australs per dollar
in September, rose to about 730 australs per dollar at the end of
October, or about 10 percent above the official rate.
In early October, Venezuela cleared its $920 million in interest
arrears on public sector debt to commercial banks, using $320 million of
its own reserves and $600 million from a club loan from a limited group

IV-33
of banks. The clearing of the arrears has led to a resumption of talks
on a restructuring of Venezuela's public sector debt to the banks and on
a possible package of new money and debt- and debt-service reduction.
Significant disagreements remain, however, both among the banks
themselves and between the banks and the Venezuelan authorities as to
Venezuela's actual financing needs.
A sharp fall in imports and firmer oil prices have greatly improved
Venezuela's balance of payments this year. A current account surplus of
several hundred million dollars is expected in 1989, compared with a
$4.5 billion deficit in 1988. The public sector budget deficit has also
fallen sharply, from 8 percent of GDP last year to near zero in 1989.
The Philippines announced in late October that it expected to be
able to raise enough money from its commercial bank creditors to cover
its estimated financing gap of $1.4 billion in 1989-90. Creditor banks
are to indicate by November 10 how much new money they will provide, as
well as how much, if any, existing debt they would be willing to sell
back at a 50 percent discount. The debt buyback is to take place on
January 3, 1990, and is expected to retire about $1.3 billion of the
country's $7.2 billion in medium- and long-term bank debt.
Costa Rica and its commercial bank creditors have agreed in
principle to a debt reduction plan, despite $325 million in interest
arrears. Under the agreement, announced October 26, Costa Rica would
buy back a projected 60 percent of its $1.8 billion commercial bank
debt, which includes the arrears, at about 16 cents on the dollar. The
remaining principal would be converted to par bonds carrying a 6.25
percent annual coupon. Banks tendering at least 60 percent of their

IV-34
exposure under the buy-back would receive interest guarantees and a
shorter maturity for the bonds. The agreement also calls for Costa Rica
to repay immediately $26 million of the unrepurchased $130 million in
interest arrears (40 percent of $325 million), with the balance to be
repaid over 15 years at LIBOR plus 13/16, with no grace period.
