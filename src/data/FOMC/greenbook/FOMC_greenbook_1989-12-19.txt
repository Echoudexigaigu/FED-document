The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity probably has expanded further in the fourth quarter,
but only modestly. Manufacturing has weakened noticeably, with a good deal
of the softness--apart from the setback at Boeing--concentrated among the
big-three automakers and their suppliers. Construction activity has been
relatively firm, and the service sector still appears to be growing fairly
rapidly. Price increases remain damped by ample supplies and foreign
competition; with no apparent relief from rising labor costs, profit margins
are under pressure in many industries.
Labor Market
Private payrolls rose 199,000 in November, following a downward-revised
gain of 106,000 in October. All of the November increase occurred in the
service-producing sector, where employment grew 213,000. While much of this
rise occurred in the services industry, especially in health care, gains
were widespread. A noticeable exception was general merchandise where
hiring in November only about matched seasonal norms; whether this reflected
demand or supply conditions is not clear, but reports of labor scarcity were
common among retailers.
Manufacturing employment fell 27,000 last month; since March, this
industry has trimmed nearly 165,000 jobs. Much of the decline has occurred
in the motor vehicle and related industries, but there have been notable
cutbacks elsewhere, particularly in electrical machinery.
State and local government employment grew only 6,000 in November,
after a loss of 2,000 jobs in October. An increase of 106,000 originally
had been reported for October; that gain had looked suspicious, and the

downward revision to this series, which has a history of questionable "first
closings," was not surprising.
In the household survey, the civilian unemployment rate edged up to
5.4 percent in November, the highest level since January. However, the
increase in the unemployment rate was accompanied by a gain of 241,000 in
household employment, and the employment-population ratio returned to its
historical high of 63.0 percent. Nevertheless, other data from the
household survey suggested some softening in the labor market last month:
the percentage of job losers (particularly those on layoff) rose
substantially, and the number of individuals involuntarily employed part-
time increased.
A slight uptick in joblessness also is apparent in data for insured
unemployment. New claims for unemployment insurance have fluctuated around
350,000 per week since early October--up from around 320,000 in August and
September. Claims were inflated to some extent in October by Hurricane
Hugo, strikes in the telecommunications industry, and the California
earthquake. But more recently, layoffs in the manufacturing sector appear
to have boosted initial claims. The level of insured unemployment also
moved higher in October and early November, but, to date, the insured
unemployment rate is only a tenth higher than in late September.
Industrial Production
Industrial activity has been weak in the current quarter, even after
allowance for the effects of the Boeing strike and the California
earthquake. Industrial production was about unchanged in October, after
adjustment for these special influences. Based on preliminary estimates,
output--with the same adjustment--appears to have declined a bit in

November. Auto assemblies fell 500,000 units to a 6.2 million unit annual
rate (FRB seasonals), but the output of trucks rebounded.
Much of the weakening in industrial production this year has been the
result of a significant decline in the output of motor vehicles (chart).
The falloff in production of motor vehicles and parts directly reduced total
IP about 0.6 percent between December 1988 and November 1989 (table).
Judging by input-output relations, the reduction to IP may have totaled 1.2
percent when account is taken of the secondary effects on industries that
supply materials to automakers (for example, steel, machinery, and
plastics). IP increased only 0.7 percent over this span.
Personal Income and Consumption
Personal income increased $41 billion in October--well above the
average pace of recent months. In part, the pickup in October reflected the
influence of special factors, including bonus payments to employees in the
motor vehicle industry .($6.8 billion at an annual rate) and an increase in
subsidy payments to farmers ($7.2 billion). Although the October change in
personal income was boosted by the recovery of rental income from the
effects of Hurricane Hugo, the rise was more than offset by the California
earthquake; on net, the two disasters subtracted $6 billion from the
increase in income in October. Stripping away all of these effects, the
October increase--at $33 billion--was still a strong one. In November,
however, labor income growth likely was weak, given the performance of
aggregate hours and hourly earnings.
Consumer spending apparently was not quite so strong during the third
quarter as previously had been estimated; taken alone, the downward
revisions contained in the latest retail sales report would be consistent

with growth in real PCE of about 6 percent during the third quarter (annual
rate), down 1/4 percentage point from the first estimate.
Turning to the fourth quarter, BEA's initial estimate for real PCE in
October showed a decline of 0.9 percent. However, the most recent retail
sales report is consistent with a downward revision to this figure as well;
other things equal, the October decline at this point appears to have been
more on the order of 1.1 percent (not at an annual rate). Outlays for motor
vehicles were very weak in both October and November, as sales of new cars
and trucks fell markedly after the introduction of the 1990 models. The
only major area of strength in the October spending figures was services,
which increased 0.5 percent--somewhat above the pace of recent months; the
increases in this category were widespread.
Non-auto spending rebounded considerably in November, according to the
advance retail sales estimates; spending at apparel stores surged
2-1/2 percent in nominal terms, more than retracing the declines in the
preceding two months; spending at general merchandise stores and furniture
outlets also posted sizable gains in nominal terms last month. Anecdotal
reports suggest that shopping since Thanksgiving has been about in line with
most retailers' expectations. Promotional activity has been described as
aggressive, especially at the upper end of the market.
Autos and Light Trucks
Sales of new cars and light trucks were 12.8 million units at an annual
rate in November, down 300,000 units at an annual rate from the already
sluggish pace in October. Slower auto sales by the domestic big three
accounted for the decline from October to November, and their share of the
domestic market in November sank to 60 percent--among the lowest readings on

record. Lower sales in November of imported autos were offset by an
increase in sales of domestically produced foreign nameplates, and thus
total sales of "foreign" autos were unchanged.
In large part, the recent slowdown in sales is a payback from the
elevated pace of the third quarter. But demand likely has been restrained
by other factors as well, including large increases in sticker prices on
many of the 1990 model-year cars. The relative strength of foreign auto
sales during the first two months of the 1990 model year may reflect smaller
sticker price increases than for domestic makes as a result of the strength
of the dollar. At the end of November, inventories of domestically produced
cars stood at an estimated level of 1.7 million units--up more than 100,000
units since the beginning of the new model year.
Faced with soft demand and rising inventories, the domestic automakers
have cut production. The most recent schedules put assemblies in December
and January close to the low 6.3 million unit annual pace (BEA seasonals) of
November. A shortfall from these plans would not be surprising. Moreover,
although the companies have not made significant revisions to their initial
plans for February and March, industry analysts have suggested that
additional cuts may well be announced.
Capital Goods
Indicators of business fixed investment in the current quarter are
sparse, especially when one recognizes the importance of exports and imports
of equipment and the susceptibility of construction data to large revisions.
Our best judgment at this point, however, is that real business fixed
investment will be about unchanged this quarter, abstracting from the hiatus
in deliveries of Boeing jets.

In October, shipments of nondefense capital goods--excluding aircraft,
and weighted to include only final business purchases--fell 1.9 percent, to
a level 1-3/4 percent below the third-quarter average. A notable drop in
computing equipment was reinforced by small, but widespread, declines
elsewhere. In addition, shipments of complete aircraft declined about 24
percent in October, mainly reflecting the strike at Boeing; the effects of
this decline will be felt more strongly on exports than on domestic
investment.1
The orders data for October suggest that the weakness in equipment
shipments will continue in the near term. Outside of aircraft and
computers, bookings fell 3.8 percent in October, to a level 2 percent below
the third-quarter average (table and chart). Although computer orders fell
in October, they have been in an uptrend for some months, suggesting a
2potential for growth in nominal shipments. Given the ongoing price
decline for computers, this sector still could make a positive contribution
to real equipment shipments in the current quarter. Bookings for
nonelectrical machinery outside of computers fell in October and have
trended down since earlier this year. In addition, orders for
communications equipment posted a notable decline in October, after a strong
showing in the third quarter.
Recent data suggest continued moderate growth in nonresidential
construction in the current quarter, but advance indicators point to renewed
1. BEA's NIPA calculation of aircraft purchases does not use the Census
M-3 data on aircraft shipments; BEA uses data from the Current Industrial
Report, which is available about a month later. Nevertheless, the M-3 data
provide a preliminary measure of aircraft shipments.
2. A caveat: data on computer orders and shipments have been subject to
large revisions recently.

weakness in coming quarters. Construction put in place rose 0.6 percent in
October, led by a 3.5 percent increase in non-office commercial
construction. Industrial and institutional construction also were up in
October, in a continuation of recent trends (chart). In contrast, the
Baker-Hughes count of oil and gas rigs in use moved down in October and the
first three weeks of November.
Looking beyond the current quarter, vacancy rates have remained high,
4and construction permits have turned down. Furthermore, credit may not
be so readily available for new projects as it has been in recent
years, especially with lending institutions recognizing sizable losses on
commercial real estate. As a result, the prospects for any sustained
expansion in nonresidential construction do not appear favorable.
The McGraw-Hill survey taken in September and October also points to a
substantial deceleration in capital spending next year. The survey
indicates that firms expect nominal outlays to increase 4-1/2 percent in
1990, a pace slightly stronger than reported in the fall survey from
Economic Consulting and Planning, Inc. (ECAP). Manufacturers expect a 6-1/2
percent increase--about two-thirds of this year's advance--with much of the
slowdown concentrated at producers of nondurable goods. The survey also
reports a substantial slowing outside of manufacturing.
3. Over the next few quarters, business spending on nonresidential
structures likely will be boosted by rebuilding activity in the wake of
Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake. The uptick in October--
particularly in the non-office commercial sector--could reflect the effects
of the hurricane, but probably only a small amount of rebuilding from the
October 17 earthquake had occurred by the end of the month.
4. The Coldwell Banker metropolitan office vacancy rate was 19.8 percent
in the third quarter and has been little changed since mid-1988. However,
the vacancy rate has declined somewhat from its peak of 21.5 percent in
early 1987.

In addition to the indicators discussed above, recent declines in
corporate cash flow do not bode well for investment spending in the near
term. Growth in real gross business fixed investment and real cash flow
have moved together in recent years (chart), with peaks and troughs in the
growth of cash flow in the 1980s generally leading those in investment by
one or two quarters. Although the growth of cash flow has been quite
volatile during 1989 (even when measured as the change from a year ago), it
nonetheless is signaling a deterioration in the availability of internal
funds. Given the lags involved, this decline in corporate liquidity is
likely to be a restraining influence on capital spending into 1990.
Inventories
Inventories in manufacturing and trade excluding auto dealers rose at a
$21 billion annual rate in real terms in the third quarter, close to the $19
billion pace in the second quarter. Preliminary current-cost data show that
manufacturers' inventory investment was moderate in October, but that
merchant wholesalers experienced a sharp increase in their stocks.
Preliminary current-cost data show that manufacturers' inventories rose
at annual rate of $12 billion in October. The bulk of this accumulation in
October was in defense aircraft and parts, a series that is rather volatile.
Despite a small drop in shipments, the inventory-to-shipments ratio for all
manufacturing excluding transportation equipment edged down (chart, upper
panel).
In the wholesale trade sector, inventories rose at an annual rate of
$37 billion in October, after increasing just $1.4 billion (annual rate)
5. Cash flow is defined here as the sum of undistributed after-tax
profits and capital consumption allowances, with capital consumption
and inventory valuation adjustments.

over the third quarter. About two-thirds of the October increase was in
motor vehicles, groceries, and farm products. The motor vehicle category
tends to be dominated by imports; the increase probably was largely
transitory, although import car sales have been rather soft. The food stock
increases almost certainly were transitory. There also was a $3 billion
increase (annual rate) in stocks held by wholesale distributors of apparel.
Wholesale sales edged down 0.1 percent in October, after posting gains in
the preceding two months. The wholesalers' inventory-sales ratio rose from
1.27 months to 1.29 months in October--in the middle of the range of 1.27 to
1.32 months observed over the past couple of years (chart, middle panel).
The inventory-sales ratio for non-auto retailers edged down in
September but remained on the high side of recent experience (chart, lower
panel). Anecdotal reports suggest that some financially troubled department
stores may have had difficulty obtaining desired stocks from producers, but
that other merchandisers--including discounters--took on the supplies.
Overall, the available inventory data do not indicate a significant
misalignment with recent sales levels, but they suggest the possibility of
some heaviness of stocks here and there--an impression consistent with the
anecdotal information.
Housing Market
Housing starts rose appreciably in October from an exceptionally low
September level, but remained well below the average pace of recent years.
The subdued level of activity reflects in part longer-run demographic
trends but also some short-term changes in supply and financing conditions.
In the market for single-family homes, starts increased 7 percent in
October to 1.03 million units, 3 percent above the level that prevailed

during the second and third quarters. Sales of new homes slowed in
September-October, after surging in July and August. In the existing-home
market, sales held in October at a level near the high for the year.
Despite the October rise, the reaction of starts to moderating mortgage
rates has been rather weak. Although interest rates on conventional fixed-
rate mortgages declined by more than a full percentage point during the
summer months, and initial rates on adjustable-rate mortgages fell about 2/3
percentage point, single-family starts have been essentially flat since
early 1989, likely owing to the effects of other factors that impinge on
home construction. For example, several areas of the country have an
overhang of single-family homes and condominiums for sale, especially the
Northeast, where the rise in home prices in recent years has impaired
housing affordability. In addition, trade reports suggest that some savings
and loan associations have restricted the credit available to builders in
both the single-family and multifamily markets because of new capital
requirements as well as new limitations on the amount of credit that a
thrift can extend to a single borrower.
In the multifamily sector, starts rebounded in October from a dismal
September, rising to 393,000 units. Multifamily starts averaged 350,000
units for the two months, about the same as the average in the second and
third quarters. Continued high rental vacancy rates are likely to inhibit
any significant expansion in multifamily construction activity in the near
term; and recent surveys of homebuilders indicate continued pessimism about
the outlook for this segment of the market.
Although housing starts have declined in recent years, real residential
investment expenditures have remained relatively stable (chart). This

II-25
divergence between starts and real expenditures stands in contrast to the
pattern that prevailed through the mid-1980s, when these series usually
moved in tandem. Shifts in the composition of housing starts in recent
years have contributed to the greater stability of residential investment
spending. The decline in total starts has been concentrated in the
multifamily market, which has less than half the average value per unit of
single-family homes. As a result, the reduction in starts has exerted a
less-than-proportional effect on residential investment spending.
Gradual increases, on average, in the size of dwellings and the
addition of other structural characteristics that boost costs have bolstered
construction spending in both the single-family and multifamily categories
relative to the pace of starts. Upscaling of structural characteristics
helped maintain expenditures on new single-family homes through 1988; more
recently, real spending in that category has declined because of the slowing
of single-family starts (lower panel). Spending in the multifamily category
similarly has been bolstered by a rise in the unit value of multifamily
starts, which partly counteracted the sizable falloff since 1986 in units
constructed. Finally, the overall uptrend of other components of
residential expenditures, including home improvements, has lent continued
support to residential investment spending in recent years.
Federal Government
In October, the first month of fiscal year 1990, the federal government
recorded a budget deficit of $26.1 billion, compared with $27.0 billion a
6. For example, the living area of a typical new single-family home
increased 9 percent during the 1986-88 period to about 2,000 square feet. A
similar relative increase occurred for multifamily units. Other structural
features, such as central air conditioning and fireplaces, have become
increasingly common in newly constructed homes in recent years.

II-26
year earlier. Receipts in October rose 7-1/2 percent from the year-earlier
level to $68.4 billion, an increase that was about in line with the change
in nominal GNP over this period. Outlays, at $94.5 billion, were reduced
$3 billion by a shift in a military pay date from October 1 to September 29.
Spending on agriculture continued at a reduced level; CCC outlays were
$0.3 billion compared with $2.5 billion a year earlier. Gross spending of
$7.9 billion in October by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) was
partially offset by $4.5 billion in receipts from the Resolution Funding
Corporation (REFCORP).
Congress now has passed all of the FY90 appropriations bills and has
approved a reconciliation bill that reduces the FY90 deficit by $17.8
billion (according to preliminary calculations by the Congressional Budget
Office), a bit more than contemplated in the April bipartisan budget
8
agreement. This reconciliation bill, including the temporary extension
of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sequester through the first week of February,
is estimated to reduce FY90 noninterest outlays $11.1 billion, increase
receipts $6.1 billion, and cut debt service $0.6 billion.
7. The RTC is responsible for resolving thrift cases that were still open
after December 31, 1988, and all new insolvencies over the ensuing three
years. The RTC was authorized to spend $20 billion in FY89, with $19
billion provided by the Treasury and $1 billion from the Federal Home Loan
Banks. The RTC has spent only $10 billion; the remaining $10 billion can be
spent this fiscal year. RTC's receipts comprise the proceeds from asset
liquidation and REFCORP bond issues. RTC is expected to have little
budgetary impact beyond its initial $19 billion authority, except for
mismatches of receipts and outlays in particular accounting periods.
8. The total effect of these bills on the deficit is still being estimated
by OMB and CBO; it is expected to be close to the April total but with
larger cuts in defense.

The extension of the sequester lowers outlays $4.6 billion, which will
reduce new budget authority in defense programs 1.4 percent and in
unprotected nondefense programs 1.5 percent. Few other provisions generate
permanent reductions in outlays; the major exception is the $2.2 billion cut
in Medicare payments. Among the essentially one-time savings in the bill
are the extension of certain lump-sum civil service retirement benefit rules
($0.7 billion), reductions in farm payments ($0.6 billion), and increases in
user fees ($0.2 billion).
On the receipts side, the major revenue producers in the reconciliation
bill are the temporary extension of certain excise taxes ($1.4 billion) and
a speedup of the collection of payroll taxes ($2.7 billion). Accounting
gimmicks include the shift of the Postal Service to off-budget status to
reduce recorded outlays by $1.8 billion, an increase in payments from the

Postal Service to the government by $0.4 billion, and the reclassification
of the Financial Assistance Corporation (part of the Farm Credit System) as
a government-sponsored agency to reduce on-budget outlays by $0.4
billion.
State and Local Governments
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
rose an estimated 2.3 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter. Thus
far this year, growth in real purchases has averaged just 2.0 percent, less
than half the pace recorded during the preceding five years. Nonetheless,
nominal growth in expenditures continued to outpace revenue gains in the
third quarter, and the deficit on operating and capital accounts, which
excludes social insurance funds, deteriorated to a record $34.8 billion.
Construction spending in the state and local sector now has fallen for
three consecutive quarters, the first such string of declines since 1980;
the weakness so far this year has been widespread. In contrast, preliminary
estimates show large advances for some categories of building in October
(chart). In particular, real spending for school facilities jumped nearly 5
percent above the previous month; education, driven by an uptrend in the
school-age population, has been one of the few areas of public construction
to experience sustained growth since 1985. Construction spending for sewer
systems also advanced sharply in October. Highway construction declined in
October despite the start of earthquake-related repairs and rebuilding of
highways and bridges. Highway construction, which makes up nearly 40
9. Press reports have cited $14.7 billion as the size of deficit
reduction in the reconciliation bill. However, this figure excludes the
$2.7 billion increase in FY1990 receipts arising from an acceleration in the
collection of payroll taxes, and $0.4 billion in outlay timing shifts; it
does include other "savings" such as moving the Post Office off-budget.

percent of real state and local government outlays for structures, peaked in
1988 and has dropped back this year. Construction of most other types of
infrastructure also flattened out in the last year or so, except
construction of prison facilities. Expenditures on corrections and law
enforcement have become the fastest growing spending category in state
general funds budgets.
Labor Costs
Few new data on wages have been received since the last Greenbook. In
November, average hourly earnings are estimated to have edged down 0.1
percent. The largest declines occurred in finance, insurance, and real
estate and in services, reversing much of the large increase reported in
those industries in October. In addition, the increase in average hourly
earnings in October was revised down to 0.4 percent--0.3 percentage point
less than initially reported. The revisions were widespread. Over the past
twelve months, average hourly earnings have risen 3.6 percent.
In 1989, with the unemployment rate averaging about 5-1/4 percent,
labor unions have been more successful in collective bargaining than they
were earlier in the decade. However, gains in compensation this year have
not been associated with a substantial pickup in strike activity. Major
work stoppages (through October) totaled 46, up only slightly from their
historical low of 40 in 1988 (chart); and days lost because of strikes and
the proportion of workers on strike, while higher this year, remain low in
historical perspective.
In this environment, first-year union wage adjustments have picked up
noticeably; in the first nine months of 1989, 45 percent of new agreements
called for first-year wage increases in excess of 4 percent, up from 25

percent of all contracts in 1988 (table). Although wage gains have
generally been higher this year, lump-sum payments have continued as an
important feature of new settlements.
Recent major settlements have underscored the tougher bargaining
attitude of unionized labor. In the agreement with Boeing, 58,000
machinists ended their 48-day strike on November 20. After accepting lump-
sum payments in lieu of wage increases in their previous contract, the
profitability of Boeing led the union to demand both base wage increases and
lump-sum payments. Under the terms of the agreement, workers will receive
base wage increases totaling 10 percent over the life of the contract
(table). Furthermore, a generous COLA formula will almost fully protect
real wages against inflation; this feature contrasts with the general
pattern of declining COLA protection in contracts through the third quarter
of this year. In addition, workers will continue to receive substantial
yearly bonus payments. Given the backlog of unfilled orders and the
extraordinary profitability of the firm, the settlement at Boeing is
unlikely to set a pattern for labor agreements in the aerospace industry.
Although the machinists' union will attempt to replicate portions of the
Boeing pact, it is likely to represent a ceiling rather than a floor in
negotiations with other, less prosperous, companies.
In recent strikes at the regional telephone companies, the major issue
in the negotiations was the preservation of health insurance benefits.10
Management had attempted to require workers to pay a portion of their health
10. On August 6, strikes began at the seven regional phone companies:
Ameritech, NYNEX, Bell Atlantic, Bell South, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern
Bell, and US West. Most of the strikes ended by early September; however,
the walk-out at NYNEX did not end until December 1, when workers ratified a
new three-year agreement.

insurance premiums--a demand that was unacceptable to the unions. In the
NYNEX settlement, the company agreed to continue to pay the full cost of
insurance, but in return, the workers accepted lower increases in base wages
and gave up their bonus payments.1 Ultimately, the overall cost of the
NYNEX settlement will depend on whether the company can bring its health
insurance costs under control. Should the price of medical care continue to
rise at its recent pace, the NYNEX agreement is likely to represent a
sizable increase in the firm's overall compensation costs.
Family-care benefits were an important issue in negotiations between
the Communications Workers and AT&T that were concluded in May. As growth
in the working-age population slows during the next decade, the provision of
such benefits likely will become more widespread as employers try to attract
and retain experienced workers. However, such benefits programs also are
likely to raise employers' costs. The AT&T agreement provided for modest
wage increases and bonus payments. However, the contract established a fund
to develop community child-care centers and grants to cover adoption fees.
In addition, workers are allowed to take up to a year of unpaid leave to
care for a newborn child, newly adopted child, or an ill dependent; in all
cases, the company will pay for the employee's benefits for the first six
months. Funding of career development programs was expanded significantly,
and a computer system was established to assist workers in finding new
positions at AT&T if their present jobs are eliminated.
11. In the NYNEX contract, workers will receive a first-year base wage
increase of 3 percent and 1.5 percent in the second and third years.
Contracts at the other regional phone companies also did not require workers
to pay for their health insurance coverage. Instead "preferred provider
plans" were established in some contracts and deductibles were increased.

II-37
Prices
The consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in October, a bit faster than
in recent months, mainly reflecting a pickup in energy prices. Excluding
food and energy, the CPI was still up 0.5 percent; over the past twelve
months, the CPI excluding food and energy has risen 4-1/4 percent--down
slightly from the 4-1/2 percent annual pace over the preceding year.
Producer prices of finished goods rose 0.4 percent in October, following a
0.9 percent increase in September; this price measure has registered wide
swings since the summer, reflecting movements in the prices of food, energy,
and motor vehicles.
The CPI for energy rose 0.6 percent in October--after four months of
declines--as higher crude oil costs were passed on to the retail level.
Prices of gasoline and fuel oil were up about 1 percent and 3-1/2 percent,
respectively. However, posted prices of domestic crude oil have eased a bit
since October, and private survey data point to a decline in retail gasoline
prices in November.
Food prices advanced 0.4 percent in the October CPI, a moderate pickup
from the pace of recent months. Sharp increases were posted for dairy
products, pork, and some fresh fruits and vegetables. Further increases in
the prices of dairy products appear likely over the remainder of 1989 as the
price of milk continued to rise sharply at the farm level in November. In
addition, livestock prices have moved up recently in spot commodity markets,
and egg prices have climbed, suggesting further upward pressures on.the
retail prices of related products. However, vegetable prices appear to have
eased in some spot markets in recent weeks after a temporary surge around
mid-autumn.

All told, the rise in food prices over 1989 as a whole likely will
match or slightly exceed the 5-1/4 percent hike recorded in 1988, when
supplies of a number of crops were severely damaged by drought. The lack of
deceleration this year partly reflects continued supply problems in some
agricultural markets--notably a poor wheat crop this year and a drop in
dairy production. At the same time, increases in demand also appear to have
played a role. For example, the USDA projects that exports of meat and
poultry in 1989 will be up about 30 percent from 1988; although exports
constitute only a small portion of the total use of these products, the
additional demand this year probably has helped to forestall a softening of
prices that otherwise might have developed in the face of this year's
production gains.
Apart from these supply-demand shifts, an impetus for inflation in the
food area seemingly is still coming from wages and other nonfarm costs. An
area in which these underlying pressures are most apparent is in the CPI for
food away from home, which as of October was up more than 4-1/2 percent from
a year earlier--a slight acceleration from the pace of 1988. Prices of more
heavily processed grocery products also have risen sharply--some of them as
much as 6 percent over the past year.
The commodities component of the CPI less food and energy was up 0.6
percent in October, boosted for the second month by a hike in apparel prices
associated with the introduction of fall and winter clothing. Nevertheless,
apparel prices, which had been heavily discounted during the summer, were
only 1-1/2 percent above their levels in October 1988. Prices of new cars
advanced 0.6 percent--after five months of declines--as higher-priced 1990

12models were entered in the sample for the first time. Despite the latest
increases, the CPI for commodities less food and energy has risen at an
average annual rate of 2-3/4 percent so far this year, well below the 4
percent pace during 1988; this slowdown reflects, in part, the moderation in
import prices. In contrast, the 0.4 percent increase in the CPI for
nonenergy services in October was similar to the 5 percent annual pace that
has prevailed since mid-1988.
Since mid-October, spot prices of industrial commodities have moved
lower. Notable among these declines is an 8 percent drop in the prices of
industrial metals (chart), which reflects in part the slowdown in the pace
of industrial activity. Special factors in individual markets also have
played a role; in particular, copper prices have fallen more than 20 percent
13over the past two months as earlier disruptions to supply have eased. In
contrast, the prices of precious metals have risen sharply, on net, since
mid-October, led by a rise in gold prices of nearly 15 percent. While the
explanation for this movement is not entirely clear, many market analysts
have attributed it to concerns about the stability of financial markets, in
the aftermath of the October stock market drop, and to uncertainty generated
by events in Eastern Europe and the USSR. Heightened concerns about
inflation also have been mentioned as a contributing factor, although a rise
14in inflation expectations is not confirmed by other data. Indeed, in the
12. In the CPI, the new-model cars are phased into the sample over several
months, roughly in proportion to sales. In October, 1990 models represented
approximately 25 percent of new cars in the CPI sample.
13. The most notable example was a labor agreement reached at a large
Canadian mine after a long strike.
14. The Survey Research Center survey shows expectations for inflation
(CPI) a year ahead holding at 4-3/4 percent in November. According to the
Hoey survey, inflation expectations a year ahead were 4-1/4 percent in
November, about 1/2 percentage point below the August reading.

Hoey survey, 10-year inflation expectations dropped from 4-1/2 percent in
August to 4-1/4 percent in November, the lowest figure in the 11-year
history of the survey. Over longer periods, the dollar price of gold has
tended to move inversely with the exchange value of the dollar, and indeed
the recent increases in gold prices have coincided roughly with a weakening
of the dollar.
Leading Indicators of Recession
The latest readings on recession-probability measures based on indexes
of leading economic indicators are generally in the ranges that have
prevailed since last spring. Based on the October report for the Commerce
Department's index of leading economic indicators, the probability that a
recession would start in the next six months was 22 percent. This was up
from the September reading of 12 percent. In contrast, a measure based on a
leading index compiled by the NBER showed a 9 percent probability, slightly
below the September reading.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have changed little on balance since the November FOMC
meeting, despite indications of a sluggish economy and more favorable
prospects for reduced defense spending. Some notable gyrations occurred in
the money markets in the days surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday as a
result of the market's mistaken view--and its subsequent correction--that
the Federal Reserve had eased policy. Federal funds have traded recently at
around 8-1/2 percent, where they were at the last FOMC meeting. Since
peaking in March, interest rates have declined between 1-1/2 and 2
percentage points.
Continuing to respond to previous declines in market rates, M2 growth
remained relatively rapid in November. M3 growth picked up last month as
runoffs in managed liabilities at thrift institutions abated. In November,
M2 was near the midpoint of its 1989 target range, while M3 was just above
the lower bound of its range.
Credit demands from nonfinancial sectors appear to have weakened in
November. Business borrowing moderated, as nonfinancial firms cut bond
issuance well below October's brisk pace, while growth in the total of
commercial bank business loans and commercial paper advanced only a little.
Federal debt issuance slackened last month, as the Treasury drew down its
cash balance, and borrowing by state and local governments moderated
further. Current information on recent credit use by households is scarce,
but commercial bank data suggest some slowdown in mortgage lending in

October and November; growth in consumer installment credit likely was weak
in November, with rapid growth at banks probably offset by declines at other
holders.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Despite continued rapid expansion of OCDs, M1 growth slowed to a
3 percent annual rate in November, as demand deposits declined after their
October bulge. Currency continued to advance sluggishly, and its velocity
likely has risen further in the fourth quarter. As shown in the chart, the
velocity of currency does respond to changes in its opportunity cost, but
(since the mid-1980s) with a lag. Thus, the recent weakness in the quantity
of currency demanded may be an ongoing response to earlier increases in its
opportunity cost.
M2 growth, at an 8 percent annual rate in November, owed mainly to
strength in its liquid components. The opportunity cost of OCDs, MMDAs, and
savings deposits, whose own-rates adjust sluggishly, has fallen almost
2 percentage points since market rates began to decline in the spring, and
growth in these liquid deposit components reached a 16 percent rate in
November (chart). Retail money market mutual funds (MMMFs), which have
grown rapidly most of the year, were again robust in November, despite
reports that banks and thrifts have mounted aggressive promotional efforts
to market MMDAs as insured alternatives to MMMFs. The expansion in the
liquid components of M2 came mainly at the expense of small time deposits,
which edged down in October and November. However, a weakening in recent
months in net noncompetitive tenders for Treasury issues suggests that the
expansion in liquid accounts also represented some shifts out of instruments
not in M2.

The acceleration of M3 to a 6 percent pace in November largely
reflected a slowing in the contraction of managed liabilities at thrifts.
As discussed more fully below, the pace of asset shrinkage at capital-
deficient thrifts evidently moderated in November. In addition, Resolution
Trust Corporation (RTC) infusions into, and resolutions of, institutions in
conservatorship ceased temporarily. Thrift institutions reduced large time
deposits by less last month than in October, and runoffs of term RPs abated
sharply from the rapid pace of recent months. Large time deposits at
commercial banks expanded last month at about their October pace, and term
RPs grew briskly, though some of the strength in term RPs reflected normal
switching out of overnight RPs that occurs around the Thanksgiving holiday.
Institution-only money funds expanded in November after declining in
September and October, as their yields lagged declines in market rates.
Bank credit decelerated sharply in November to a 4 percent rate of
growth. Net purchases of government securities, though at a still rapid
16-1/4 percent pace, were well down from October's extraordinary increase,
which had been boosted by the investment of cash received when banks
acquired failed thrifts from the RTC. Federally related mortgage-backed
securities (MBSs), which are part of government securities, were responsible
for a significant share of the October growth. Banks' purchases of MBSs
were somewhat smaller in November, but still made up the lion's share of
inflows to investment accounts. Other securities declined at a 15-3/4
percent annual rate in November as several large banks sold holdings of
municipals. These banks had recently made substantial additions to their
loan-loss reserves and apparently chose to sell their municipals in the
expectation that the tax benefits the securities confer would be less

1valuable in coming years .Growth in business loans slowed to a 1 percent
rate last month despite some pickup in merger-related lending. Real estate
loans edged down to a 10-1/2 percent rate of increase. At 8-1/4 percent,
consumer loans at banks registered their fourth consecutive rapid advance in
November, even as securitization of consumer receivables depressed the
measured growth rate by about 2 percentage points.
Thrift Institutions
Total assets at SAIF-insured institutions shrank at a 12 percent annual
rate in the third quarter, compared with a 3 percent decline in the second
quarter. The sell-off in thrift assets was concentrated in mortgage assets
and reflected both the need of capital-deficient thrifts to reduce assets in
order to meet the new regulatory requirements and an RTC-mandated
contraction of thrifts in conservatorship. In line with the decline in
assets, funding needs at these institutions also dwindled in the third
quarter. The chart shows the relatively close correlation between changes
in the "funding proxy" (total deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank Advances, and
repurchase agreements) and changes in total assets. Thrift funding
continued to shrink rapidly in October, but the decline moderated in
November, signaling at least a pause in the shrinkage of the thrift
industry.
Third-quarter earnings for SAIF-insured institutions are not yet
available, but announced losses at 53 thrifts, which hold more than a fourth
of the industry's assets, widened to $600 million in the third quarter from
1. The securities sold were grandfathered under the Tax Reform Act of
1986, allowing banks to continue to deduct from taxable income 80 percent of
the cost of carrying them. The deduction would no longer be available if
banks wished to repurchase these (or similar) municipals.

$154 million in the second quarter. The fourfold increase mainly reflected
increased loan-loss provisions on real estate loans at thrifts in Florida,
the Southwest, and New England, and large losses on junk bond portfolios at
a few thrifts. It is unlikely that the thrift industry as a whole
experienced such a dramatic decline in earnings, as few institutions hold
junk bonds, but the numerous reports of increased asset quality problems
bode ill for the rest of the industry.
Since its inception in early August, the RTC has spent $9.9 billion to
resolve 33 insolvent institutions having $9.1 billion in assets. More than
half of these assets were accounted for by two institutions. In the vast
majority of cases the RTC transferred insured deposits to healthy
institutions, mostly banks, which have paid premiums for the deposits
ranging from zero to 2.5 percent. To date RTC also has spent about $9
billion to replace high-cost borrowed funds at thrifts in conservatorship.
Recently, however, such replacements have ceased, causing these thrifts to
bid more aggressively for deposits.
Although insolvent thrifts have continued to enter conservatorship, the
RTC has not resolved any cases since October 20. The pace of resolutions
has been slowed by the lack of a well-defined plan of action, the lack of
working capital, and difficulties involved in completing a catalogue of
2assets for sale. Nonetheless, the RTC recently announced that it will
soon take bids on fourteen small thrifts.
2. Currently, the RTC has a strategic plan out for public comment, and it
is expected to be ready for implementation by January.

III-11
Business Finance
In November short- and intermediate-term business borrowing grew only a
bit faster than its lackluster October pace, as the slowdown in business
lending at banks was offset by a turnaround in commercial paper growth.
Gross public offerings of bonds by nonfinancial corporations declined from
October's hectic pace, largely owing to reduced issuance of junk bonds.
Yields on these bonds widened about 20 basis points further over Treasuries
in November, and there were more than usual delays and reconstitutions of
scheduled issues, reflecting increased investor resistance. Recently passed
legislation, removing tax advantages of high-yield bonds that delay cash
interest payments, could discourage issuance and put a damper on some
mergers and takeovers. Lately conditions have settled down a bit. While
yield spreads remain large, rates on higher-quality junk issues have
declined. Junk bond mutual funds, which experienced sizable outflows in
September and October, have reported renewed investor interest in recent
weeks.
Corporate restructurings have slowed this quarter, perhaps reflecting
uncertainties in the junk bond market and bank reluctance to finance
takeovers. The staff currently projects net equity retirements in the
fourth quarter at an annual rate of roughly $85 billion, down from $145
billion in the third quarter. Despite this slowdown in mergers and
acquisitions and disappointing third-quarter corporate earnings, broad stock
indexes have increased 3 to 4 percent since the last FOMC, and the price-
earnings ratio for the S&P500, at 14-1/2, now stands at a high for 1989.
These gains appear to be based on market expectations of further near-term
declines in interest rates, since the outlook for corporate profits has not

improved. Indeed, large advances in share prices were reported for the
interest-sensitive utility sector.
Equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations, at $1.2 billion in
November, remained close to its third-quarter pace. Issuance by financial
firms was boosted by a $1.7 billion closed-end mutual fund offered by
Merrill Lynch. This fund will invest in the senior debt of highly-leveraged
transactions, either through purchases from commercial banks in the
secondary market or as a participant in primary syndicates. The fund
expects to pay investors at a rate approximating the bank prime rate. Since
their emergence in April 1988, these prime-rate mutual funds have attracted
about $5.5 billion. In most cases fund shares are not expected to be traded
in secondary markets. The funds themselves will continue the practice of
redeeming shares quarterly at their net asset value.3
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff estimates that the projected $75 billion fourth-quarter
federal deficit is being financed by $64 billion of borrowing from the
public and by a substantial drawdown of the Treasury's cash balance. The
increase in borrowing relative to last quarter is taking place primarily
through increases in the regularly auctioned 3-, 6-, and 12-month bills.
Since the beginning of the third quarter, the gross sizes of the weekly bill
auctions have been raised in steps from $13.2 billion to $16.0 billion.
These increases were prompted by the need for funds associated with the
thrift bailout, and by the usual seasonal swing in financing needs, which
typically is accommodated through bill issuance.
3. Because of the illiquidity of the secondary market for the loans that
make up the bulk of the funds' assets, the determination of net asset values
can involve a good deal of judgment by the funds' managements.

III-14
The Treasury raised $15 billion in the third quarter through cash
management bills, which are issued irregularly in response to special,
usually short-term, needs. Because they are costly, with rates running 25
basis points or more above those on regularly scheduled bills of similar
maturity, the Treasury probably will not use cash management bills as a net
source of funds this quarter. Such bills have been used by the Treasury
twice so far this quarter, however: once in late October in connection with
the reversion of the debt ceiling to $2.8 trillion on November 1, and again
in late November to bridge a low point in the cash balance in early
December.
Although the bill sector is shouldering most of the load from higher
fourth-quarter borrowing, the contribution from the coupon sector also is
rising, as the gross sizes of coupon auctions have been boosted by between
$250 million and $500 million. Nonmarketable borrowing was boosted in
October by the zero-coupon bond issued by the Treasury to back the principal
of the REFCORP bond. The full $4.5 billion face value was included in
nonmarketable borrowing, although the market value of the issue was
substantially less. The discount from face value showed up as a negative
entry in the "Other" category of means of finance.
In the market for sponsored agency debt, spreads on new issues were
slightly narrower in November than in October. Secondary-market spreads on
REFCORP bonds have stayed in a range of 25 to 28 basis points since these
bonds were issued in October.
In October both Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks paid down
sizable amounts of debt. In November the paydown continued at the FHLBs.
FHLB financing needs were damped by the continued decline in advances to

III-15
member thrifts, whose balance sheets were shrinking to meet regulatory
capital requirements. Partly offsetting this influence, however, has been
the FHLBs' move toward investing in mortgage-backed securities, as their
spreads over Treasury securities have been viewed as attractive. Press
reports estimated total FHLB holdings of MBSs at less than $2 billion, or
only about 1 percent of assets, at the end of October. Current system-wide
FHLB policy limits holdings of mortgage securities to 50 percent of capital,
or roughly 4 percent of assets. Fannie Mae has been acquiring mortgage
assets on a larger scale than have the FHLBs, and continued to do so in
October, concomitantly increasing its debt by $300 million.
Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term municipal securities eased to $8.7 billion
in November, down slightly from October's moderate $9.1 billion pace.
Offerings for new capital were up slightly. Refunding volume fell, however,
despite a small decline in municipal bond yields, perhaps indicating that
issuers foresee further declines in yields.
The ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields now stands at the high level
of .93 (up from .84 in May), partly because of heavy sales of municipals by
banks since mid-summer. This increase in their relative yield evidently has
attracted the interest of individual investors. In October $1.8 billion
flowed to municipal bond mutual funds, up from $1.0 billion in September,
and a $.7 billion monthly average in 1988.
Reflecting weaker economic conditions in the northeast, Moody's
recently downgraded Massachusetts general obligation bonds to Baa-1 from A,
and Standard and Poor's has been reviewing the credit rating of the
Commonwealth's general obligation debt. Massachusetts lawmakers recently

III-16
passed a bill designed to cut in half the projected 1990 budget deficit of
$730 million. New York City and Connecticut also are projecting significant
budget deficits. These budget problems already have raised the cost of
borrowing for Massachusetts and New York City, as recent issues have traded
at yields substantially higher than those on bonds from other regions.

Mortgage Markets
Rates on conventional fixed-rate mortgage loans have declined a few
basis points since the last FOMC meeting, about in step with declines in
secondary mortgage market yields. Initial rates on adjustable-rate
mortgages indexed to the one-year constant maturity Treasury yield have
declined by slightly more over the period, widening the initial rate
advantage of ARMs to 137 basis points. The FRM-ARM rate spread is still
narrow by past standards and, coupled with relatively low fixed-rate credit
costs, has kept the FRM share of new conventional mortgage originations at

about 75 percent, according to results from the Federal Housing Finance
Board's monthly survey of major institutional lenders.
Increased fixed-rate lending in recent months has been associated with
an expansion in the operations of mortgage bankers, while commercial bank
lending activity also has been strong. Mortgage originations at SAIF-
insured thrift institutions, meanwhile, slowed to a seasonally adjusted
$14.6 billion in September, and new commitments to originate mortgages
declined slightly. Sales of mortgages by SAIF-insured institutions totaled
$8.4 billion in September, down from the August level but above the average
monthly level of the first two quarters. The pickup in mortgage sales by
thrifts in the third quarter is consistent with the shift toward FRMs: to
lessen the maturity gap on their balance sheets, thrifts are more likely to
sell FRMs (as opposed to ARMs) into the secondary market than to hold them
in portfolio.
The recent surge in new FRMs has allowed issuance of federally related
pass-through securities to rise sharply since mid-summer, to a seasonally
adjusted $19.4 billion in October. Despite the strong pace of issuance and
heavy sales of securities associated with thrift restructurings, spreads of
MBSs over Treasuries have changed little, on balance, in recent months.
This may be attributable in part to the strong demand for pass-throughs as
collateral for CMOs and other derivative securities. FNMA and FHLMC have
remained the dominant issuers of CMOs and REMICs primarily because the
flatness of the yield curve has made it difficult for private, higher-cost
issuers to generate arbitrage profits from CMOs.

III-19
Reacting to recent softness in housing prices, FNMA and FHLMC recently
announced that, effective January 1, 1990, the maximum limit on single-
family loans they will buy or guarantee has been lowered from $187,600 to
$187,450. Multi-family loan limits also will decrease.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit picked up to a 5-3/4 percent rate
in October, at the high end of the range evident since the spring.
Automobile credit rebounded to a 4-1/2 percent rate of growth in October
after declining the month before, tracing a pattern that seemed out of
kilter with that of new-car sales, which dropped in October. However, part
of the discrepancy likely reflects difficulties in the seasonal adjustment
process owing to the timing of major sales incentive programs in the past
few years.
Revolving credit and the large "all other" component (primarily
personal cash loans and sales finance contracts) both grew somewhat faster
than auto credit in October. Nevertheless, revolving credit growth, at
6-1/2 percent, was relatively slow for the second consecutive month and was
well below the 16 percent annual rate recorded during the first half of
1989. With revolving credit at banks following a more subdued path and new-
car sales even weaker in November than October, consumer installment credit
probably experienced little growth in November, despite the fairly brisk
advance in total consumer loans at banks. The growth at banks probably
reflected a gain in their market share rather than faster growth in
aggregate consumer lending. Savings and loans have been selling off

Recent data suggest some deterioration in consumer credit quality at

delinquency rate for all types of closed-end loans climbed from 2.3 percent
in the second quarter to 2.8 percent in the third, thus recording one of the
series's largest increases and putting the rate at a high level by
historical standards. The ABA's series for credit card delinquencies rose
as well, though by a much smaller amount. At the auto finance companies
delinquency rates remained at relatively high levels, rising from 2.5
percent in the second quarter to 2.6 percent in the third.

APPENDIX
GROWTH OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN 1989
Growth in M2 has been uneven over the course of 1989, with marked
weakness in the first part of the year giving way to robust growth
thereafter. On balance over the year, M2 expanded 4-1/2 percent, down from
5-1/4 percent growth in 1988, placing it just below the midpoint of its 1989
annual target range of 3 to 7 percent. The slower rate of increase in M2
this year reflected some moderation in income growth, but it primarily arose
from the pattern of interest rate changes, with the effects of sharp
increases late in 1988 and early 1989 outweighing the later drop in rates.
As a result, annual velocity rose. In addition to the swings in interest
rates and opportunity costs, M2 was buffeted by the special effects of
outsized tax payments in April. M1 evinced a similar, though more
pronounced, intrayear pattern, ending up in November 1/4 percent above its
level of the fourth quarter of 1988; this is down appreciably from last
year's growth of 4-1/4 percent.
After expanding 6-1/4 percent in 1988, M3 hugged the lower bound of its
3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent target cone in 1989, closing the year about 4 percent
above its 1988:4 base. The relative weakness in M3 during 1989 mostly
reflected the shrinkage of the thrift industry; growth in bank credit was
maintained at the 7-1/2 percent pace of last year.
Domestic nonfinancial debt grew at a fairly steady pace over 1989,
averaging 8 percent from the last quarter of 1988 through October of this
year, which placed it near the midpoint of its monitoring range of 6-1/2 to
10-1/2 percent. This year's rate of debt expansion was down more than one
percentage point from the rate recorded in 1988, about in line with the
projected deceleration of nominal income.
M1
By May, M1 had declined at about a 3-1/2 percent annual rate from its
1988:4 base, reflecting a lagged response to earlier increases in short-term
rates and an extraordinary bulge in net individual tax remittances to the
Treasury. From May to November, M1 rebounded at a 4-1/2 percent rate as
the cumulating effects of falling interest rates boosted demands for money.
Velocity continued the upward trend begun in 1987, increasing at about an 8-
1/2 percent rate in the first three quarters of 1989 before turning down in
the fourth quarter in lagged response to interest rate developments. Still,
for 1989 as a whole, growth in velocity likely will equal its most rapid
pace in the last 30 years.
Demand deposits declined in 1989 at a rate exceeding last year's
runoff, although outflows from those accounts slowed in the second half of
the year. Indeed, sharp increases in demand deposits were recorded in the
opening weeks of the third and fourth quarters of 1989, most likely because
of the need to post higher required compensating balances in response to
previous declines in short-term interest rates.

III-A-3
Payments for nonwithheld taxes were unexpectedly large in April of this
year, depressing holdings of liquid balances at the end of that month and
into May as those payments were cleared. Other checkable deposits, the main
personal payment medium, fell 30 percent at an annual rate in May after
having declined at a 2-1/2 percent rate in April. From May to November,
OCDs rebounded to average about an 8-1/2 percent annual rate of increase as
tax-depleted balances were rebuilt, and as depositors responded to relative
movements in opportunity costs. In general, rates on liquid deposits tend
to adjust more slowly to changes in market rates than those of less-liquid
small time deposits. Accordingly, as interest rates declined, rates on time
deposits were marked down more quickly, producing a relatively greater
decline in opportunity costs of liquid deposits.
Currency growth has decelerated in each of the three quarters of 1989
and likely will end the year up about 4-1/2 percent. This rate of growth is
quite slow in a historical context, particularly relative to the rapid
expansion of currency in the 1985 to 1988 period. However, it is consistent
with econometric evidence that suggests a response of currency to interest
rate changes, but with long lags.
M2
The pattern of M2 growth in 1989 mostly reflected rising and then
falling short-term market interest rates, although special factors added
variability to the overall aggregate and its composition. Through the first
five months of 1989, M2 grew at only a 1 percent annual rate from its 1988:4
base but then accelerated to an 8-1/4 percent pace in the period from May
through November. After a succession of quarterly increases since 1986, M2
velocity turned down in the third quarter of 1989, responding to diminished
opportunity costs; still, evidence suggests that M2 velocity will rise about
1-1/2 percent, on average, over 1989, about in line with model forecasts.
The composition of the nontransaction portion of M2 shifted
substantially. Early in the year, rising market interest rates buoyed the
growth of small time deposits at the expense of more liquid deposits, as
rates on the latter accounts adjusted only sluggishly to the upward market
movements. Unexpectedly large tax payments apparently contributed to the
weakness in liquid instruments in April and May, as those balances were
drawn down to meet tax obligations directly or through transfer to M1
accounts. By May, MMDAs plus savings deposits had declined at a 16 percent
rate from their levels of the fourth quarter of 1988, while small time
deposits had risen at a 17-1/4 percent rate. As market interest rates fell,
the relative rate advantage reversed in favor of liquid instruments and,
from May to November, MMDAs plus savings deposits and small time deposits
averaged growth rates of 6-3/4 and 4-1/2 percent, respectively. The rebound
in liquid deposits also was fueled by the replenishment of accounts drained
by tax payments. It appears the the tax-payment episode was only an
exaggeration of the normal seasonal pattern and that it had no effect on the
growth of M2 on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis.
Another major compositional shift within M2 reflected a movement of
deposits from thrift institutions to commercial banks and money fund shares.
Funds were withdrawn from thrifts as depositors abandoned reputation-scarred

III-A-4
institutions and regulatory pressures brought down rates paid by some high-
flying thrifts. This latter factor gained importance following the passage
of FIRREA and the creation of the RTC in August, which targeted some of its
funds to pay down high-cost deposits at intervened thrifts. The RTC also
began a program of closing insolvent thrifts and selling their deposits to
other institutions--for the most part, banks. In October, the closure of
four large thrifts by the RTC transferred roughly $5 billion in deposits
from thrift to commercial bank ledgers. Overall, household savings
instruments (the sum of MMDAs, savings, and small time deposits) grew 7-1/2
percent at commercial banks from the fourth quarter of 1988 to November and
declined 1/2 percent at thrifts. On balance, however, weak deposit growth
at thrifts appears to have been about offset by shifting into commercial
banks and money market mutual funds, leaving overall M2 little affected by
the thrift crisis.
Indeed, by November, the money funds--which posted a record inflow in
1989--were about 30 percent above their level of the fourth quarter of 1988.
In addition to attracting investors avoiding thrifts, money funds drew
customers because they offered a rate advantage relative to Treasury bills
for much of the year, in part, because of the tendency for returns reported
on money funds to lag declines in market rates.
Overnight RPs and Eurodollars, although changing erratically from month
to month, trended downward through the year. Apparently, stronger inflows
into core deposits allowed banks to bid less aggressively for funds. Also,
the $3-1/2 billion drop in overnight RPs reported at banks is comparable in
magnitude to declines identified with reporting changes during 1989, as
several large banks reclassified their primary dealer operations in U.S.
government securities from operating units of the bank to nonbank
subsidiaries of the bank holding company.
M3
While the movements of M2 in 1989 are well explained by the underlying
demands for its components, M3 continued to reflect bank and thrift funding
needs. While bank credit in 1989 will likely about match last year's 7-1/2
percent pace, credit at thrift institutions at the end of third quarter of
this year stood a bit below the level of the fourth quarter of 1988. In
addition, funds paid out by the RTC directly substituted for both M3 and
non-M3 liabilities, or permitted institutions acquiring deposits to pay down
other liabilities.
As a result, M3 was hit far harder by the thrift crisis, with less of
the rebound in the narrower aggregates in the second half of the year
showing through to this broader aggregate. In May, M3 stood 3 percent above
its 1988:4 base, moderately accelerating in the six months ending in
1. The operations were transferred to subsidiaries set up to engage in
underwriting certain securities--such as commercial paper, municipal revenue
bonds, and corporate bonds--that have been authorized by the Board.
Government securities business provides volume to dilute these activities
down to the mandated maximum of 10 percent of the subsidiary's business
volume.

November to post a 4-3/4 percent growth rate. In particular, managed
liabilities at thrifts ran off at a stunning pace as insolvent institutions
were sold off by the RTC and thinly capitalized ones pared their balance
sheets (table). From May to November, thrift large time deposits declined
at about a 19 percent annual rate, while thrift term RPs fell at a 57
percent rate, despite the $22 billion paydown of FHLB advances.
Through November, the 5 percent increase in large time deposits over
the level in the fourth quarter of 1988 obscures an 8-1/2 percent rate of
increase at banks and a 7-3/4 percent drop at thrifts. Similarly, the
16-1/2 percent decline in term RPs overall is made up of a 26-1/2 percent
rate of contraction at thrifts compared with a 17 percent rate of growth at
banks. Growth in institution-only money market mutual funds, which in
November were 15-1/2 percent above their fourth quarter 1988 levels, helped
stanch the flow of the non-M2 components out of M3. As is the case with M2
money funds, rates on institution-only funds lag market declines, an effect
that boosted these funds as interest rates fell over much of the year.
Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt
Although growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt slowed in 1989 as
it had the preceding two years, it still exceeded the growth of nominal GNP.
The federal sector's debt grew at a 7-1/4 percent annual rate through
October, more than 3/4 percentage point below 1988's rate of increase and
the slowest rate of expansion in a decade. Debt growth outside the federal
sector eased more, to average 8-1/4 percent through October, mostly because
of a decline in the growth of household debt. Mortgage credit slowed in
line with the reduced pace of housing activity. Consumer credit growth,
although volatile from month to month, trended down through much of the
year. In the first half, consumer credit growth generally tracked movements
in personal consumption expenditure. In the third quarter, however,
consumer credit expansion fell short of the growth in spending--particularly
for automobiles.
The growth of nonfinancial business debt so far this year slipped
further below the extremely rapid rates of the mid-1980s; heavy corporate
restructuring activity continued to be a major factor buoying corporate
borrowing, although such restructuring activity showed distinct signs of
slowing late in the year as lenders adopted more caution.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit was $7.9 billion in September
(on a seasonally adjusted Census basis, customs valuation), compared
with a revised $10.1 billion deficit in August. About half of the
narrowing of the deficit in September resulted from a reduction in non-
oil imports from peak August levels. The decline in oil imports in
September (nsa) was all in quantity as prices rose by about 25 cents per
barrel. An increase in exports in September was about evenly divided
between agricultural shipments and other exports. The degree of
volatility in recent monthly trade figures is not unusual. Data for
October will be released December 15 and will be summarized in the
Greenbook supplement.

IV-3
For the third quarter, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, on a
seasonally adjusted balance-of-payments basis, was $111 billion at an
annual rate, $1 billion larger than in the second quarter (revised).
The growth of total exports slowed substantially in the third
quarter in terms of quantity; and excluding sharp increases in aircraft
and computers, the quantity of exports fell. The greatest declines were
in agricultural products (most importantly corn and soybeans),
automotive parts to Canada, consumer durables, chemicals, and coal.
Exports of other capital goods were about the same in the third quarter
as in the second quarter after having risen strongly each quarter since
mid-1988. The increase in aircraft exports resulted in part as Boeing
stepped up deliveries of 747-400s in an effort to reduce inventories.
The strike at Boeing, which began October 3 and lasted 7 weeks, will
reduce substantially the value of aircraft exports in the fourth
quarter. The value of exports rose less than 1 percent in the third
quarter as prices declined slightly.
The quantity of imports rose 4 percent in the third quarter
reflecting increases in both oil and non-oil categories. A 2 percent
increase in the quantity of non-oil imports (the strongest rate of
increase since the fourth quarter of last year) was largely in computers
and parts, consumer goods, and food. The demand for consumer goods
reflected a pickup in U.S. domestic consumer expenditures (excluding
autos) in the third quarter. The value of non-oil imports rose less
than 1 percent as prices fell.
The quantity of oil imports jumped 8 percent in the third quarter,
reaching the highest level in 10 years. The bulk of the increase went
into domestic stocks as production fell only slightly more than

IV-4
consumption. Weekly data suggest that the quantity of oil imports was
slightly higher in October than in September.

The price of imported oil declined in the third quarter by about
$1.60 per barrel from the high second quarter level. However, in
October spot and posted prices rose in response to a series of events
that led to concerns about availability of supplies, including
unexpected short-falls in North Sea and Nigerian crude supplies, and the
announcement of a possible 50 percent cut in Soviet exports.
Import and Export Prices
The price of total imports (reported by BLS) increased 0.7 percent
in October, led by a 5.0 percent jump in oil prices. Prices of non-oil
imports edged up by 0.2 percent for the second month in a row. Most of
the increase in non-oil import prices reflected a strong rise in
passenger car prices with the introduction of 1990-models. The increase
in car prices (in September and October) followed seven consecutive
months of price declines. Nearly offsetting the increase in prices of
imported cars were declines in the prices of capital goods (importantly
attributable to the appreciation of the dollar during the calculation
period), foods, and industrial supplies other than oil. These last
three categories have recorded price declines in nearly every month

since March. The price of imported consumer goods showed small
increases in most months of 1989 (including October), with increases in
some categories (such as apparel and nondurable household goods) being
offset by declines in other categories (such as photographic and home
entertainment equipment).
Changes in the exchange value of the dollar significantly affect
import prices published by BLS for capital goods (e.g. machinery,
professional and scientific apparatus) and consumer goods (e.g.
photographic apparatus and optical goods). Prices of imported
automotive products are largely in dollars. Producers in European
countries are more likely to price in their own currencies than
producers in Japan. Developing countries, including the NIEs, tend to
price in dollars. Prices (about 15 percent of which are quoted in
foreign currencies) are sampled at the beginning of the month and
converted into dollars at the average rate of the preceding month.
Export prices in October rose for the second consecutive month.
Prices of capital goods and automotive products provided most of the
increase. Since the beginning of the year export prices of these two
categories have risen slightly in nearly every month, with a cumulative
increase to date for each of 3 percent; this was about the same rate as
domestic prices suggesting that producers allow the foreign-currency
price of their products to vary along with the exchange value of the
dollar. Prices of exported consumer goods also rose by a cumulative 3
percent since the beginning of the year (recording an increase in every
month except October); this was only a marginally slower rate than
domestic prices. In contrast, prices of most exported industrial
supplies appear to be affected somewhat by changes in exchange rates and

IV-7
have fallen steadily since mid-year at rates in excess of declines in
comparable domestic prices. Prices of agricultural exports declined in
October for the third month in a row. During the first 10 month of the
year agricultural export prices declined 3 percent (led by soybeans and
corn).
U.S. Current Account in 1989-03
In figures released this morning by the Commerce Department, the
U.S. current account deficit narrowed to $91 billion (saar) in the third
quarter, from $128 billion (revised) in the second quarter. Nearly all
of the improvement was attributable to a swing from reported capital
losses to reported capital gains on net direct investment assets,
reflecting changes in the exchange value of the dollar. Excluding
capital gains and losses, the current account narrowed by $6 billion in
the third quarter, entirely the result of increased net service receipts
(primarily recovery of insured losses from foreign reinsurers, and
increased military sales). A table and an assessment of the data will
be included in the Greenbook supplement.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Large net inflows into banks were reported again in September,
bringing the total for the third quarter of 1989 to $13 billion on a
balance-of-payments basis. (See line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table.) Most of these inflows resulted from
transactions of banks in the United States (excluding IBFs) with their
own offices abroad. However, these data, which are based on changes
between the last days of each month, give a misleading impression of
developments in the quarter because of large day-to-day changes.
Examination of the daily Federal Reserve data indicates a very large

inflow in the last days of September and a $20 billion outflow on the
first business day in October. The large inflow at the end of
September appears to be, in part, the result of semi-annual window
dressing by Japanese-based banks, inflating the size of their end-of-
period balance sheets. On a monthly average basis, Federal Reserve data
show only a small reduction in the net claims of U.S. banking offices on
their offices abroad and IBFs. (Line 1 of the International Banking
Data table shows an inflow of about $2.5 billion n.s.a. between the June
and September averages; this inflow was partially reversed in October
and November.)
Renewed investor concern about event risk on corporate bonds, as
evidenced by the widened spread between corporate and Treasury bond
interest rates, also appeared to shape foreign activity in U.S. bond
markets in the third quarter. Net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities
by private foreigners (line 3 of the Summary of U.S. Transactions table)
were very large. In addition, securities issued by U.S. government
agencies and corporations were an increasing fraction of foreign
purchases of other U.S. bonds (line 2a); that fraction rose to one-half
in the third quarter of 1989, from one-third in the first half of 1989,
and one-fifth or less in previous years. New Eurobonds issued by U.S.
corporations dropped sharply in the third quarter, more sharply than
issuance by U.S. corporations in the domestic market; some rebound
appears to have occured so far in the fourth quarter. Foreign net
purchases of U.S. corporate stocks (line 2b) were strong in the third

transaction. SmithKline (U.S.) and Beecham (U.K.) merged to form
SmithKline Beecham (U.K.); part of the payment to the stockholders
of SmithKline (U.S.) was $5.5 billion in shares of SmithKline Beecham
(U.K.). Since the U.S. company is now an affiliate of a foreign
company, the merger will also swell the total for foreign direct
investment in the United States (line 7) for the third quarter.
Foreign official holdings in the United States increased
substantially in the third quarter, even for the G-10 countries, despite
some reported intervention sales of dollars. Accumulation of interest
earnings and troop dollars by the G-10 countries, as well as some
shifting of dollar investments from the Euro-markets by the G-10 and
OPEC, probably account for much of the reported increases. Partial
information from the FRBNY indicates that G-10 reserves in the United
States declined by about $3 billion in October.
The large inflows reported so far in the balance of payments
accounts for the third quarter suggest that the statistical discrepancy
in the accounts will swing from a large inflow in the second quarter to
an outflow in the third. Errors and omissions in the reporting of
capital flows probably are responsible for much of these wide swings.
However, part may also be the result of timing problems in the direct
investment reports. Firms are not required to report on the basis of
calendar quarters; in cases where the firm's fiscal year does not
correspond to the calendar year, BEA places the report in the quarter
that matches most closely. In the case of highly publicized large
transactions, BEA does shift transactions to the calendar quarter when
they actually occurred; for example, U.S. direct investment abroad in
the second quarter of 1989 will be revised down by a couple of billion

IV-12
dollars as the result of the June sale of foreign affiliates by a
U.S. company that was reported by the company as part of its fiscal
third-quarter operations. However, apart from the few large
transactions that come to BEA's attention, timing discrepancies in the
direct investment accounts probably contribute to swings in the
statistical discrepancy.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average exchange value of the dollar in terms of the
other G-10 currencies has declined about 3-1/2 percent since the
November 14 FOMC meeting, as shown in the accompanying chart. News
about the U.S. economy seemed to have little influence on dollar
exchange rates during this period, even as market perceptions that the
Federal Reserve had eased further were disappointed and U.S trade data
for September showed a smaller-than-expected deficit. Rather, the
dollar's decline was largely the counterpart of the mark's rise, with
the dollar falling 5-1/2 percent against the mark, to a 12-month low,
and somewhat less against other EMS currencies. The dollar eased 1
percent against sterling but firmed 1/2 percent against the yen. The
mark's strength arose primarily from the market's favorable assessment
of the potential impact on the German economy of political developments
in Eastern Europe.
The German stock market recovered from the loss it suffered in
October, rising about 9 percent over the intermeeting period, with its
rise especially sharp during the last two weeks. Stock markets were
strong in Japan, the United Kingdom, and France as well, as each of
those markets rose to higher levels than before the stock sell-off in
October.

IV-13
One factor which depressed the yen was an unraveling of previous
expectations of a near-term discount rate hike in Japan. Market
participants now expect the Bank of Japan to postpone an increase in its
discount rate until after the general election of the Lower House of
Parliament in February. Japanese 3-month CD rates eased about 15 basis
points over the period, to 6.6 percent. In Germany, the 3-month
interbank rate eased 25 basis points to just above 8 percent. Bond
yields were little changed in both Germany and Japan. The price of
goldrose more than 6 percent over the intermeeting period.
The mark's strength generated pressures within the EMS during the
intermeeting period and prompted speculation about an EMS realignment.
Spreads between bilateral mark rates and central rates increased by
about 70 basis points for the franc, which fell to near the bottom of
its 2-1/4 percent band, and 160 basis points for the lira, which fell
out of the narrow band at the period's close. The lira's allowed
deviation within the EMS is 6 percent, though Italian authorities have
expressed an interest in reducing that to 2-1/4 percent. The peseta-
mark spread has declined about 230 basis points.
the Desk followed with intervention on two
occasions, selling a total of $150 million against yen.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recently released national accounts data suggest divergence in
economic activity among industrial countries in the third quarter.
Growth in Japan rebounded very strongly in the third quarter. Although
special factors reduced the measured rate of third-quarter growth in
Germany, growth adjusted for calendar effects continued to be firm. In
the United Kingdom the pace of non-oil economic activity remained
depressed in the third quarter, while in Canada domestic demand slowed
and real growth rebounded only slightly in the third quarter after a
sharp slowdown in the first half of the year. Monthly data for France
and Italy also suggest a slowdown in economic activity in the third
quarter.
Inflation appears to have moderated somewhat in recent months,
although special factors contributed to better price performance in the
United Kingdom and Japan. Recent developments in external accounts have
been mixed. Germany's trade surplus increased significantly in the
third quarter, while deficits in France, and Italy continued to grow.
On the other hand, Japan's external surpluses continued to decline, due,
in part, to valuation effects associated with earlier weakness of the
yen earlier this year.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, the pace of real activity has
been strong in recent months. Real GNP increased by 12.2 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, mainly reflecting rapid domestic demand
growth. Consumption spending in the third quarter rose at an 8.2
percent annual rate. Plant and equipment spending increased at a 32.5
percent rate, and residential investment was up at a 9.6 percent rate.
Net exports made a small positive contribution to growth. Imports

roseat a rapid 16.9 percent rate, but exports grew at an even faster
25.3 percent rate.
Industrial production (s.a.) increased 0.3 percent in October and
was 5.4 percent above its year-earlier level. Retail sales (s.a.) rose
2.6 percent in September and, for the third quarter as a whole, were up
5.5 percent from the second quarter. Capacity utilization (s.a.)
declined 2.9 percent in September, only partially reversing a 4.2
percent jump in August that raised the index to its highest level in
over 9 years. The unemployment rate (s.a.) edged up slightly in
October, but remained in the narrow 2.2 percent to 2.3 percent range it
has maintained since the beginning of the year.

The consumer price index for the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) declined 0.9
percent in November, due in part to a weather-related drop in food prices.
This lowered the 12-month rate of increase of the consumer price index to
2.5 percent, the first time since April that this rate has been below 3
percent. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) declined 0.6 percent in October, but
the 12-month rate of increase remained unchanged at 3.3 percent.
The current account surplus (s.a.) declined further in October. For
the first 10 months of the year, the cumulative current account surplus
was $61.5 billion (s.a.a.r.), well below the annualized $80 billion

IV-20
surplus in the same period last year. A lower trade surplus accounted for
about half of this decline, reflecting in part the J-curve effect from the
lower value of the yen earlier in the year. Over half of the decline in
the services account is accounted for by a more negative tourism balance.
In Germany, real GNP (s.a.a.r) fell by 2.1 percent in the third
quarter, after increasing 12.2 and 1.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
preceding two quarters respectively. The decline in third-quarter output
reflects, in part, significant calendar effects from fewer working days in
the quarter. The Bundesbank reported that when both seasonal and calendar
factors are taken into account real GNP actually increased at a moderate
pace. The external sector continues to support German demand as an
increase in net exports partially offset a 0.6 percent decline in domestic
demand. Other data suggest that economic activity has been firm.
Industrial production in the third quarter was 2.1 percent greater than in
the second quarter and capacity utilization rose further to its highest
level since the early 1970s. Total orders increased 0.7 percent in the
third quarter while foreign orders increased 1.1 percent.
Despite large influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe, principally
East Germany, the unemployment rate has been stable. It remained at 7.8
percent in October, and increased only 0.1 percentage point (s.a.) in
November. Between August and November the number of East European
immigrants reported as unemployed increased by 102,000, or 0.4 percent of
the civilian dependent labor force.

Germany's trade surplus (s.a.a.r) increased by $6.8 billion to
$77.4 billion in the third quarter, only slightly below the record level
recorded in the first quarter. Because this increase was partially
offset by a sharp increase in transfers, the current account surplus
(s.a.a.r.) increased by only half that amount to $57.8 billion. In
October both the trade and current account surpluses fell sharply to $61
billion and $45 billion (n.s.a.a.r.), respectively.
Domestic activity in France has shown signs of slowing recently.
The September industrial production index (s.a.) was 2.1 percent below

IV-22
the July-August average and now stands only 1.2 percent above the level
of September last year. This slowing was seen in virtually all
industrial sectors. Consumption of manufactured products fell 7.9
percent (s.a.a.r) from August to September, but since consumption (s.a.)
grew vigorously during the summer, consumption of manufactured products
in September was still 5.2 percent above September 1988. Gross fixed
investment for the second quarter of 1989 grew only 0.3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) from the first quarter, although corporate investment growth
continued to be strong.
In September, France posted a trade surplus (s.a.) for the first
time since September 1988, but the surplus appears anomalous since it
reflects unusually large shipment of Airbus jets and other special
factors. In the year through September, the cumulative trade deficit
(s.a.) is 28 percent greater than cumulative trade deficit for the same
period in 1988. The increase in the trade deficit has been
counterbalanced by a widening surplus in services, due primarily to
record earnings from tourism, so the current account has remained
relatively stable.
The October CPI showed a 3.6 percent increase from a year earlier;
the differential above German inflation has remained roughly stable at
0.3 percent.
The U.K. economy has remained weak. Although the output measure
of GDP grew 3.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, most of the
increase was a result of a rebound in oil production; excluding oil,
real output grew only 1.4 percent (s.a.a.r.), compared with 0.7 percent
in the second quarter. In November, the Confederation of British
Industry, the leading employers' association, reported that companies'

IV-23
outlook for orders is the worst in two years, and that exports have
declined while stocks have accumulated. Industrial production fell 0.8
percent (s.a.) in September, with manufacturing production down 1.1
percent. The volume of retail sales (s.a.) fell 0.8 percent in November
to a level about the same as a year ago. However, the unemployment rate
(s.a.) fell to 5.9 percent in October, its lowest level since 1980.
The 12-month change in consumer prices fell to 7.3 percent in
October; but the index which excludes mortgage interest payments
increased to a record 6.1 percent. Output prices for manufactured goods
(n.s.a.) rose 0.2 percent in November to a level 4.9 percent above year-
earlier levels. Import prices for materials and fuel stood 5.8 percent
above year-ago levels in November. Average earnings rose 9.7 percent in
the year to September while the underlying annual rate of increase in
average earnings was 9 percent.
On November 22, Chancellor John Major delivered the Autumn
Statement, in which he reaffirmed the government's priority of fighting
inflation. He also presented a gloomy official forecast: in 1990, real
GDP is projected to grow only 1-1/4 percent, while only a small
improvement in the current account and slow moderation of inflation are
expected.
Growth in real GDP (s.a.a.r.) in Canada increased slightly to 2.2
percent in the third quarter from a revised rate of 1.4 percent in the
second quarter. However, growth of final domestic demand (s.a.a.r.) was
down sharply to 1.1 percent from 5.8 percent. Investment was weak, and
consumption was unchanged from the previous quarter. Canada's current
account deficit improved slightly to $3.9 billion in the third quarter
from $4.5 billion in the second.

IV-24
Inflationary pressures appear to have eased slightly. Consumer
price inflation (n.s.a.) remained high at 5.1 percent in October due to
price level increases from excise taxes earlier this year, but monthly
changes in prices have been much lower recently. The unemployment rate
(s.a.), which has been largely unchanged in recent months, increased 0.2
percentage points in November to 7.6 percent.
The slower pace of economic activity in Italy reflected in second-
quarter GDP appears to have continued in the third quarter. Industrial
production (s.a.) fell 0.3 percent in September, after falling 1.2
percent in August. Unemployment (n.s.a.) rose slightly in the third
quarter to 12 percent (n.s.a.) from 11.9 percent in the previous
quarter.
Inflation slowed in November, with consumer prices (n.s.a.) 6.4
percent (n.s.a.) above their year-earlier level, following an increase
in October of 6.8 percent. These increases are below peak rates of 7
percent registered earlier in the summer that were associated with the
introduction of indirect taxes. Wholesale and consumer price inflation
increased in October, due primarily to increases in regulated prices.
The wholesale price index in October was 6.5 percent (n.s.a.) above its
level a year ago compared with 6 percent in September. In the third-
quarter wholesale prices were 6.2 percent above their year-earlier
level, down from the 6.8 percent in the second-quarter.
The current account (n.s.a.) worsened sharply in the first half of
1989, registering a deficit of $10.1 billion (n.s.a.), considerably
larger than the $5.4 billion deficit for all of 1988. The trade balance

IV-25
through September registered a cumulative deficit of $14 billion
(s.a.a.r.), considerably larger than the deficit of $10 billion for all
of 1988.
In a recent speech Governor Carlo Ciampi called for greater formal
autonomy for the Bank of Italy, including the authority to set the
discount rate. He argued that this is needed to preserve the
independence of monetary policy from fiscal policy and is a necessary
step if Italy is to participate in the monetary unification of Europe.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
The Mexican anti-inflation pact has been extended to July 31, 1990.
In the Mexican debt restructuring operation, with about 95 percent of
the base debt accounted for, creditors holding about 10 percent of the
base debt had pledged $1.4 billion in new money by December 13.
Brazilian economic conditions are dominated by political uncertainty as
the December 17 presidential election approaches. Argentina announced
additional measures to shore up its IMF-supported adjustment program.
Venezuela's central bank raised interest rates on short-term deposits to
stabilize the bolivar and reduce inflation. The Peruvian government
made its first substantial debt service payment to the IMF since 1986.
New money commitments to the Philippines have fallen short of the
government's goal, but an offer to buy back $1.3 billion of the
country's $7.2 billion in medium- and long-term bank debt at a 50
percent discount was oversubscribed. Opposition parties received more
support than had been anticipated in recent elections in Taiwan. In
Korea, the government introduced a package of measures to boost sagging
growth and investment.

IV-26
Individual country notes. Mexico's anti-inflation pact has been
extended for four months beyond its March 31, 1990 expiration date. The
extension includes a 10 percent increase in minimum wages, increases in
energy and other public sector prices averaging about 5 percent, a
business commitment to keep prices stable despite higher wages, and a
government pledge to continue devaluing the peso-dollar exchange rate by

The recently announced 1990 budget calls for a public sector
deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP, counting as revenue the discount to be
earned under the external debt reduction agreement soon to be signed
with commercial banks. Excluding this item, the public sector deficit
would be 5.3 percent of GDP, compared with a 1989 deficit officially
estimated to be 6.3 percent of GDP. The new budget calls for interest
payments to decline by 3 percentage points of GDP, and for public
investment to rise by 14 percent in real terms. Public sector revenues
are projected to decline by about a percentage point of GDP, mainly
because the export price of Mexican oil is forecast to average $13 per
barrel ($2 less than in 1989).
As of December 13, 378 non-Mexican banks holding $45.3 billion in
Mexican public sector debt have indicated their choice among the three
options under the debt restructuring agreement. Of a total base debt of
about $48 billion, $5.7 billion has been earmarked by 17 non-Mexican
banks ($3.6 billion) and five Mexican banks ($2.1 billion) to the new
money option, for a total new money commitment of just under $1.4
billion.

In Brazil, economic conditions are dominated by political
uncertainty as the December 17 presidential election approaches. A
public opinion poll released on December 10 showed left-wing candidate
Luis Inacio Lula da Silva advancing to within several percentage points
of conservative candidate Fernando Collor de Mello. This news helped to
push the spread between the parallel and official cruzado-dollar
exchange rates from 85 percent on December 6 to 150 percent on December
11. The monthly interest rate in the overnight market for government
debt rose to a record 58.7 percent on December 11, while monthly
consumer price inflation accelerated to over 41 percent in November.
For the three months ending in October, Brazil registered a trade
surplus of $3.6 billion, compared with $5.6 billion over the same period
last year. The cumulative surplus for the year through October was
$14.2 billion, compared with $16.1 billion for the same period in 1988.
Argentina announced additional measures to shore up its IMF-
supported economic adjustment program on December 10. The measures
include a 54 percent increase in the austral value of the dollar in the
official exchange market, the legalization of the parallel market for
foreign exchange for transactions not related to trade, substantial
increases in public sector prices, a rescheduling of most of the
domestic debt of the government, and the elimination of many government
subsidies that previously had been suspended for 180 days. These
actions were prompted by a widening of the spread between the parallel
and official market exchange rates, which was encouraging the
withholding of export receipts from the official market and leading to
large reductions in the international reserve holdings of the central

IV-28
bank. Efforts to restrain depreciation in the parallel market by
tightening liquidity had not been successful; during the first week of
December, the spread between the parallel and official exchange rates
averaged about 50 percent.
The new adjustment measures were also made necessary by the fact
that inflation has not continued to decline as initially anticipated:
monthly inflation rose from 5.6 percent in October to 6.5 percent in
November. Because of the new measures, monthly inflation may reach 20
percent in December, compared with the government's original goal of 2
percent monthly inflation by year-end.
Disagreements over policy between central bank president Javier
Gonzalez Fraga and Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli led to the
resignation of Gonzalez Fraga on November 24. He was replaced by Egidio
Iannella, who has previously headed the central bank.
On November 10, the IMF Executive Board approved a 17-month, SDR
1.1 billion stand-by arrangement for Argentina. Notwithstanding this
support, progress in implementing the structural reform program
initiated following President Menem's inauguration in July has been
slow. The Argentine Congress is still considering tax measures which
are a key part of the program, and plans for privatization of state
enterprises are also experiencing delays.
The Venezuelan bolivar's floating exchange rate, which had remained
in the 36-38 Bs/$ range from April through September, depreciated to 45
Bs/$ by early December. To prevent a further depreciation and to combat
inflation, the Central Bank of Venezuela raised the interest rate it
pays on 21 to 30 day deposits to 45 percent per annum. The monthly rate

IV-29
of consumer price inflation fell from 3 percent in October to a ten-
month low of 1.3 percent in November. On November 29, the operating
foreign exchange reserves of the Venezuelan Central Bank stood at
$3 billion, up about $900 million from their end-1988 level.
The center-left Democratic Action party of Venezuela's President
Perez won about two-thirds of the country's gubernatorial posts and a
plurality of local offices in elections held on December 4. Opposition
parties did well in some states, but failed to capitalize nationwide on
discontent with the economic adjustment policies of President Perez.
Popular dissatisfaction with all of the political parties was reflected
in a 70 percent rate of abstention.
The Venezuelan state oil company, PDVSA, is purchasing the
Southland Corporation's half-interest in the U.S. oil company CITGO.
This purchase raises PDVSA's equity stake in CITGO to 100 percent.
Commercial banks have criticized this purchase as an inappropriate use
of scarce foreign exchange reserves, but Venezuela has indicated that
the purchase will be essentially self-financing.
In December, Peru resumed partial debt service to the IMF. The
government made a payment of $42.3 million covering obligations that
have accrued since September. This represents the first significant
payment by Peru since 1986. Peru's arrears to the IMF total about $800
million.
The government of the Philippines announced late in November that
only about $700 million of new money (rather than an anticipated $950
million) had been pledged by commercial banks towards a forthcoming bond
issue. Philippine authorities also announced that 156 foreign financial

IV-30
institutions had tendered $1.8 billion in loans for a proposed debt
buyback operation and that the country had accepted $1.3 billion of
these tenders from 140 financial institutions at a 50 percent discount.
These operations are scheduled to take place on January 3, 1990, but may
be delayed due to the recent coup attempt.
On December 2, Taiwan held its first parliamentary and local
elections since the end of martial law in 1987 and the legalization of
opposition parties. The opposition captured 40 percent of the vote,
considerably more than had been anticipated. This outcome may be
related to recent large declines in Taiwan's stock market that occurred
despite a ruling-party campaign advertisement that had implied that the
government would sustain the bull market. Over the last month, Taiwan's
central bank has sold a large quantity of dollars in a successful
attempt to counter an incipient depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar.
On November 15, Korean Deputy Prime Minister Cho Soon introduced a
package of measures to boost sagging growth and investment. The
measures included interest rate cuts for manufacturers and concessional
loans and tax credits for additional investment, but did not include won
devaluation. The Korean won has remained largely unchanged since last
Greenbook after depreciating about 1 percent from its peak in April.
Concluding prolonged negotiations, the Cote d'Ivoire obtained a 17-
month SDR 176 million stand-by arrangement from the IMF in November.
