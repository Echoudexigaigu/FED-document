Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that real GNP rose only
marginally in the fourth quarter, and the signs are that the picture has
changed little thus far this year. Indeed, industrial activity appears to
have dipped sharply in January, owing to dramatic cuts in auto production
and to the effects of warmer weather on energy usage. On the inflation
front, sharp increases in aggregate price measures are likely in the near
term as a consequence of shocks to food and energy prices associated with
December's cold snap; no change is evident, however, in the underlying
trends of wages and prices.
The Labor Market
The household and establishment surveys for December did not appear to
signal any major change in labor market trends. Growth in payrolls was
relatively slow, as further job losses in manufacturing and a weather-
related drop in construction jobs partly offset continued gains in the
service-producing sector. In the household survey, the unemployment rate
held steady at 5.3 percent--the same level that has prevailed since June of
last year.
In the weeks since the December labor market surveys, initial claims
for unemployment insurance have fluctuated markedly, but on average have
moved up somewhat further. Harsh weather in December and layoffs in the
auto industry were among the factors that pushed initial claims higher. In
the auto sector, the big three laid off more than 100,000 workers in early
1. In the December release, the Bureau of Labor Statistics incorporated
its annual revision to the seasonal adjustment factors for data derived from
the Current Population Survey. Before the revision, the data for November
had showed a slight uptick to 5.4 percent.

January, extending the traditional shutdown for the Christmas-New Year
holidays. Since that time, General Motors has lengthened some shutdowns
through early February.
Over 1989 as a whole, total payroll employment grew almost
2-1/2 million. About 95 percent of the new jobs were generated in the
service-producing sector, in which gains were sizable in health services,
finance, insurance and real estate, and wholesale and retail trade. In the
goods-producing sector, increases in construction and mining offset the loss
of 104,000 jobs in manufacturing.
Although productivity data for the fourth quarter are not yet
available, the gain over 1989 as a whole appears to have been small--
probably on the order of 1/2 percent. Aggregate hours worked appear to have
risen about 1-1/2 percent over the year, and nonfarm business output
currently is estimated to have risen 2.1 percent.
The small productivity increase of 1989 probably reflects a pattern of
cyclical adjustment that is fairly typical of a slowing economy; businesses
tend to adjust output growth faster than they adjust labor input, in effect
holding on to workers until it becomes clear that the slowing of demand is
more than temporary. By this interpretation, the flatness of the
unemployment rate in 1989--in the face of growth appreciably below presumed
potential--is a consequence of businesses not yet having brought employment
into equilibrium with a lower output path.
Given this view of the past year's events, the'staff continues to
estimate that potential GNP is rising at a rate of about 2-1/2 to 2-3/4
percent. Potential labor input is estimated to be rising at a rate of
around 1-1/4 percent per year, and the upward trend in labor productivity is

thought to be adding another 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percentage points to the growth
of potential output. The staff's estimate of potential GNP growth is
slightly below the 3 percent igure being used by the Administration, whose
estimate is based on trend productivity growth of about 1-3/4 percent.
Industrial Production
Industrial production looks basically flat at present, but is being
bounced around from month to month by swings in auto assemblies and by a
number of special factors. A December rise in output of 0.4 percent
reflected both the rebound in aircraft production after the settlement of
the Boeing strike and a weather-related surge in the output of utilities.
Apart from these temporary factors, production edged down last month.
For January, the available data point to a decline in industrial
production of more than 1 percent, two-thirds of which reflects cutbacks in
motor vehicles. Automakers cut assemblies aggressively this month to an
annual rate of around 4-1/4 million units (FRB seasonals) from a
6-1/4 million unit rate in December; production of trucks also appears to
have declined after two months of increases. In addition, the January thaw
apparently has reduced electricity generation to a much lower level, more
than reversing the December surge. By contrast, the firmness of the orders
data in late 1989 (table) gives a sense that there still is underlying
support for production more generally.
For 1989 as a whole, the increase in total IP was 1.7 percent. The
output of final products rose 2.3 percent, but production of materials
expanded only 0.3 percent, owing primarily to a decline in output of parts
for motor vehicles and a substantial decrease in production of basic metals.
Among the final products, assemblies of motor vehicles fell substantially

over the year. Production of other consumer durables turned down in the
second half, after a strong first-half performance. By contrast, output of
nondurable consumer goods held up well through year-end, and the gain for
1989 as a whole was 3-1/2 percent. Like consumer durables, the output of
business equipment excluding motor vehicles was strong early on, but changed
little, on net, through the second half; production of computers declined in
the second half, aircraft production was limited in the fourth quarter by
the strike, and output of other business equipment leveled off, on balance,
after growing more than 5 percent at an annual rate over the first three
quarters.
Reflecting the sluggishness in materials output, the capacity
utilization rate at primary processing industries, which by late 1988 had
risen almost to the 1978-80 peak, dropped more than 3 percentage points over
the course of 1989. By contrast, capacity utilization at advanced
processing industries was essentially unchanged, on net, over the year,
although it did turn down in the second half. These different trends in
capacity use have been mirrored in the recent patterns of price change
(chart): Increases in materials prices, as measured by the PPI for
intermediate materials excluding food and energy, have slowed substantially
as capacity rates have eased; however, the slowing of price inflation for
finished goods excluding food and energy has been small.
Consumption and Personal Income
Real personal consumption expenditures were little changed in the
fourth quarter, as auto and light truck sales fell substantially. Excluding
motor vehicles, real consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of
about 2-3/4 percent last quarter. While this rate of increase was only

slightly below the average for the first three quarters of the year, some of
the gain was weather-related and therefore probably only transitory. In
particular, the extremely cold weather of December pushed up expenditures on
natural gas and electricity 9-1/2 percent that month, and the outlays for
fuel oil rose 19 percent. With the much warmer temperatures of January,
spending on these energy-related items probably fell sharply.2 Spending
on most non-energy services, notably medical and transportation services, is
estimated to have been robust throughout the fourth quarter.
In contrast to services, real spending on goods other than motor
vehicles and fuel oil has been weak in recent months and was down at an
annual rate of 1.2 percent for the fourth quarter as a whole. Extensive
discounting during the holiday season may have aided the sales of some
products; for example, apparel purchases rose about 1-3/4 percent in real
terms over the last two months of the year.
Real disposable personal income rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent
in the final quarter of 1989. The gain over the four quarters of the year
was 3.6 percent. In December, the growth of real income was less than in
previous months, but remained positive. The personal saving rate averaged
5.8 percent in the fourth quarter, up about 3/4 of a percentage point from
the third quarter. For the year, the saving rate averaged 5.5 percent, the
highest annual figure since 1984.
2. The BEA computes spending on electricity and natural gas from utility
billings and attempts to allocate expenditures to the month when the billing
liability was incurred. However, these data are available only with a lag;
in the interim, spending in these categories is estimated using data on
average temperatures throughout the country. December was one of the
coldest months on record, while the first three weeks of January
were unseasonably warm.

II-12
Motor Vehicles
Responding to bulging inventories and extremely sluggish sales,
automakers not only cut production but also enhanced incentive programs
toward year-end. As a result, sales of autos and light trucks picked up
sharply in late December. In the first three ten-day periods affected by
the programs, sales of domestically produced cars averaged about

The efforts to cut bloated inventories extended to most auto firms in
January. About two-thirds of the big three's production lines in the United

II-13
States and Canada were idled for one to three weeks, and some foreign
transplants temporarily slowed operations as well. Most plants were
scheduled o be back on line by the end of January, and current production
schedules call for output at a rate of 6-1/2 million units in February and
March. Even so, the 5.8 million units scheduled for the first quarter as a
whole would be the lowest quarterly output since 1982.
Sales of imported cars were at a 2.4 million unit annual rate in
December--their lowest sales pace since 1984. However, the market share of
foreign nameplates, which includes transplants made in the United States,
was 37.7 percent in December--near its recent record highs.
Business Fixed Investment
Real spending for business fixed investment fell 3 percent at an annual
rate in the fourth quarter, according to BEA's advance estimate. Excluding
investment in aircraft, which was held down by the strike at Boeing,
spending declined at a 1-1/2 percent annual rate. Business outlays for
motor vehicles dropped sharply, but there were increases in spending for
computers and communications equipment as well as heavy machinery.
Investment in structures rose slightly, as oil drilling perked up.
Over the four quarters of 1989, equipment spending increased about
6 percent; most of the growth came in the first half of the year when there
was a surge in spending for computers. Outlays for nonresidential
structures declined slightly in 1989, reflecting softness in all major
sectors except industrial building; the rise in industry apparently reflects
a lagged response to the earlier increase in utilization, given the very
long gestation periods often involved.

II-15
Recent data point to some improvement in equipment spending in the
current quarter. New bookings for nondefense capital goods, excluding the
aircraft group, rose 1-3/4 percent (not at an annual rate) in the fourth
quarter. Furthermore, with the ending of the Boeing strike, aircraft
shipments should recover to normal levels this period. Similarly, given
recent incentive programs, business purchases of automobiles should revive
from the depressed fourth-quarter pace.
In contrast to equipment, the outlook is weaker for structures.
Activity here still is being damped by the overhang in office and other
commercial space that was created during the building boom of the mid-1980s,
and the forward-looking indicators--contracts and permits--have remained
lackluster. To provide a better gauge of the usefulness of the forward-
looking indicators, the staff recently assessed the predictive power of
building permits and construction contracts for each of the major
construction sectors. This analysis identified permits as the preferred
indicator for office and institutional construction, while contracts were
the better indicator in the other commercial and total building categories
(chart). Both permits and contracts were found to have predictive power for
industrial construction; we thus are using an unweighted average of permits
and contracts as the preferred indicator for this sector. Recent movements
in these indicators suggest softness for the first half of this year in
office and institutional building accompanied by little change in the other
commercial and the industrial sectors.
3. The statistical analysis evaluated the "Granger causality," or
predictive power, of lags of each indicator in regressions of construction
on lags of construction, permits, and contracts.

Taking equipment and structures together, the recent capital spending
surveys point to a further gain in 1990, though not at the pa:e of 1989.
The Commerce Department survey of business plans for plant and equipment
outlays, taken in October and November, suggests that firms will boost
nominal outlays for plant and equipment 6.4 percent in 1990, after an
estimated 10.3 percent rise in 1989. The Commerce figure for 1990 is
somewhat stronger than the spending plans reported earlier in the private
surveys. Much of the slowdown from 1989 is expected to occur in
manufacturing, where the Commerce Department survey shows a rise in spending
this year of 3.8 percent, as compared with a 10.1 percent estimated gain for
1989. An 8 percent rise is planned in the nonmanufacturing sector.

Business Inventories
Inventory accumulation picked up in the fourth quarter. In October and
November, the growth of nonauto inventories in manufacturing and trade
averaged $38.7 billion at an annual sate in constant-dollar terms--a notably
faster rate of increase than in the first nine months of last year.
Although the currently available data suggest that serious overhangs are not
widespread, the sluggishness of final demand probably is causing businesses
everywhere to view their inventory positions in a more cautious light.
In manufacturing, part of the recent accumulation has occurred in the
aircraft industry--largely in stocks of materials and work-in-process--where
new orders have remained strong and production bottlenecks are still of
greater concern than excessive stockpiling. Outside of aircraft, net stock
increases in other industries have been quite small. The inventory-to-
shipments ratio for all manufacturing excluding aircraft and motor vehicles
has remained relatively flat since midyear (chart). This is a departure
from the earlier downtrend, and it is likely that many manufacturers would
prefer to see still lower ratios, especially in the current environment of
ample supply availability.
In contrast, retail stockbuilding accelerated late last year even
excluding buildups in autos. In particular, retailers of general
merchandise have reported persistent inventory runups since midyear and went
into the holiday season with their inventory-sales ratio precariously high.
The heavy discounting observed during the holiday season probably was in
part reflective of this problem.

Housing Markets
The cold December weather took a toll on home construction, as starts
of single-family units fell 10 percent to an annual rate of 900,000 units.
However, issuance of single-family building permits, a largely coincident
and less volatile indicator of construction, registered only a 4 percent
decline last month. A divergence between starts and permits is not unusual
during periods of abnormally cold winter weather; experience suggests that
starts delayed are largely transferred to subsequent months. Sales of new
homes fell in December from a robust November level; the average for the
fourth quarter was about the same as for the year as a whole. Sales of
existing homes were little changed in December.
Perhaps of more fundamental concern at the moment is the recent upturn
in long-term interest rates. Mortgage interest rates were essentially
unchanged during the last few months of 1989. However, with the rise in
bond rates over the past few weeks, pressures for an upward move in mortgage
rates increased, and late in the month the rate on conventional fixed-rate
mortgages increased about one-quarter of a percentage point to just above
10 percent. Even before this upturn in rates, it had seemed that the
expansion in housing activity was being damped to some degree by financing
constraints. In particular, in the wake of FIRREA, thrifts have cut back
their lending for acquisition, development, and construction. Nonetheless,
homebuilder perceptions of new home sales conditions over the next six
months rose in December and January from the relatively weak levels reported
in earlier months.
In the multifamily sector, starts edged down 2 percent in December to
an annual rate of 331,000 units. For the fourth quarter as a whole,

multifamily starts averaged 356,000 units, close to the rates of
construction in the second and third quarters of last year. Vacancy rates
for multifamily owner and rental properties moved up to about 9-1/2 percent
in the fourth quarter; n the condominium market, vacancy rates trended up
perceptibly over the course of 1989.' Starts of multifamily owner units have
declined by about one-third from a high in late 1987 to 80,000 units in the
third quarter of last year (most recent data).
In some areas of the country, the demand for housing probably is being
affected by reduced expectations of the investment return from
homeownership. As of the third quarter of 1989, year-to-year declines in
nominal sales prices of existing homes were evident in several metropolitan
areas, both in the Northeast and in other scattered localities (table). For
the nation as a whole, transaction prices of existing homes continued to
move up in 1989, though a bit more slowly than in most recent years (chart).
During the final months of 1989, the year-to-year rate of increase in
existing home prices was relatively stable at about 5 percent.
Of course, fluctuations in the average prices of existing homes may
reflect changes in the geographic or quality mix of homes sold, in addition
to house price inflation. Although quality-adjusted house price information
is not available for the existing home market, the Census Bureau does
publish such a series for new homes. During the first three quarters of
1989, year-over-year increases in these quality-adjusted new home prices
averaged about 3 percent, close to rates of increase for earlier years of
the decade (chart).

The Federal Sector
Federal purchases of goods and services, excluding the CCC, fell at an
annual rate of 6-1/4 percent in real terms in the fourth quarter. Real
defense purchases declined at an 8 percent rate and are expected to continue
to shrink owing to the steady reduction of real spending authority for
defense since FY1985. Nondefense purchases were the same as in the previous
quarter.
The federal government recorded a budget deficit of $70 billion for the
first quarter of fiscal year 1990, compared with a $68 billion deficit a
year earlier. Typically, a major portion of the fiscal year deficit is
recorded in the fall quarter because most nonwithheld personal and corporate
income tax payments occur in other quarters.
Outlays for the most recent quarter were about $9 billion higher than
in the year-earlier period, reflecting a $5 billion increase in net interest
outlays and a $7 billion rise in OASDI and medicare payments. Defense
expenditures were $6 billion lower, of which half was due to a shift in the
timing of a military pay hike from fiscal year 1990 to fiscal year 1989.
Fourth-quarter spending for deposit insurance was $7 billion--high by
historical standards but about the same as a year earlier. Agriculture
spending was off $3 billion because of declining farm subsidy payments
related to higher prices for farm commodities. Net outlays for
international affairs were $3 billion higher because the previous year's
expenditures had been reduced by a large prepayment on foreign military
sales credit.
Receipt growth has slowed markedly because of weakness in net income
tax payments; receipts for the October-December period were only 3 percent

above the year-earlier level. Taken together, withheld personal income
taxes and social security payroll taxes were 5 percent above a year earlier,
but corporate income tax payments were $3-1/2 billion lower than in the fall
quarter of 1988, reflecting weaker corporate profits. Turning to the first
quarter of 1990, preliminary data from the Daily Treasury Statement indicate
that in January receipts of nonwithheld individual income tax payments are
running 7 percent above last year's levels (January 15 was the deadline for
making the final estimated payment on 1989 liabilities); this rise is
consistent with the view that some of last year's surprisingly large final
payments reflected permanent factors such as tax base broadening rather than
merely transitory factors such as timing of capital gains realizations.
On January 29, the Administration unveiled its latest budget proposals.
The FY1990 deficit now is projected to be $124 billion, up $25 billion from
the Mid-Session Review. Changed economic assumptions (primarily in regard
to corporate profits) added $11 billion to the deficit; an upward revision
of projected spending for deposit insurance added $8 billion.
As expected, the proposed budget for FY1991 is built around the Gramm-
Rudman deficit target of $64 billion and the President's pledge of no new
taxes. On the revenue side, the President proposes a capital gains tax rate
reduction, inclusion of state and local employees in the social insurance
tax base, and some other smaller measures. While some of these measures may
reduce revenues in the long run, the Administration expects the short-run
effects to augment FY1991 revenues by $14 billion dollars. Proposed cuts in
outlays, relative to current-services estimates, would amount to $25
billion, with reductions proposed for defense ($4 billion) and medicare

II-30
($6 billion). Over the longer term, the Administration proposes a budget
path that reaches balance in FY1993, in line with GRH targets.
The Administration's projections are based on growth in real GNP of
2.4 percent over the four quarters of 1990, and 3.2 percent in 1991.
Nominal interest rates on three-month Treasury bills are expected to average
6.2 percent in 1990 and 5.4 percent in 1991 while inflation hovers around
4 percent. Over the longer term, real GNP growth is projected to remain at
about 3 percent per year, while inflation is expected to fall gradually to
3 percent by 1995 and short-term interest rates to 4.4 percent.
A more detailed presentation of the proposals will be included in an
appendix to the Greenbook supplement.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter, after three
quarters of slower growth. The pickup at the end of last year largely
reflected a surge in construction activity, especially for highways and
schools. Nevertheless, construction was down for the year as a whole--the
first decline since 1983.
The fiscal condition of the state and local sector appears to have
deteriorated further during the fourth quarter; the annual NIPA data imply
that the quarterly deficit in the operating and capital accounts (excluding
4social insurance funds) was $41-1/2 billion at an annual rate, compared
with figures in the range of $26 to $35 billion in previous quarters of
1989. In the Northeast especially, revenues have been coming in well below
4. The fourth-quarter figure has not been published in the NIPA, but can
be derived implicitly from the annual figure, which has been published.

II-31
prior projections, and many state and local government officials in that
region are beginning to talk about the need to raise taxes in order to meet
spending objectives. For example, New York is facing a potential $700
million shortfall in FY1990, which ends on March 31, and an even larger
deficit the next year. In response, Governor Cuomo has proposed raising a
variety of taxes, imposing new taxes, and suspending the final phase of an
income tax cut.
Prices
Inflation rates were relatively high toward the end of 1989 and,
because of the adverse effects of the severe winter on food and energy
prices, seem almost certain to pick up further in early 1990. The consumer
price index rose 0.4 percent in December, the same as in November. Producer
prices of finished goods jumped 0.7 percent in December, boosted by a pickup
in energy prices and a climb for tobacco products.
In the food sector, freezing weather around Christmas caused major
damage to citrus and vegetable crops in Florida and Texas and began pushing
up prices in the wholesale and retail markets almost immediately. By the
second week of January, the wholesale prices of some fresh vegetables were
more than double the levels of a month earlier. Futures prices for orange
juice also increased substantially--by more than 50 percent from mid-
December to late January; apparently, traders feel that Brazilian supplies
will not be available in sufficient quantity to offset fully the domestic
losses. Much of the current surge in vegetable prices may be reversed
within a few months, given the short growing cycle for fresh vegetables.
But the high prices for citrus products are likely to persist at least until
the harvest of next year's crop--and perhaps longer, if the freeze caused

extensive damage to the trees. On a somewhat more positive note, there is a
hint in dairy markets of some easing of the tight supply situation that
pushed up prices in the second half of 1989. In particular, milk production
in December was back up to its year-earlier level for the first time since
May, and although there was still strong upward pressure on the price of
unprocessed milk, product prices--notably for nonfat dry milk--have turned
down sharply in some spot markets. Egg prices, which surged late last year,
also have eased since early January. Overall, though, it appears that the
rise in consumer food prices in the near term might be considerably higher
than the average increase of about 1/2 percent per month in November and
December.
In the energy sector, December's cold weather boosted heating oil
demand about 14 percent above year-earlier levels. Equally important,
supplies from several major U.S. refineries were disrupted in late December
by explosions or by damage from the cold. By year-end, inventories of
heating oil had fallen about 14 percent below year-earlier levels, and
gasoline inventories were more than 5 percent below their year-earlier
levels. Spot prices for heating oil doubled over the period from November
15 to December 29.
December's unusually cold weather has been followed by a balmy January,
and the heating oil market reflects this reversal. By mid-January,
inventories of heating oil were only 7 percent below year-earlier levels,
and as of late January, spot prices were back near their mid-November range.
For much of January, however, heating oil prices remained well above
December levels. The producer price index survey was taken early in
January, when wholesale heating oil prices were about 25 percent above

early-December quotes. The consumer price survey covers the entire month,
but also is likely to show a major increase in January. The collapse in the
spot heating oil market is likely to be reflected in sharp declines in the
February price indexes. With regard to gasoline, mid-January inventories
remained about 7 percent below year-earlier levels, and private surveys
suggested major increases in both wholesale and retail gasoline prices for
the month.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI rose 0.4 percent in December,
the same as the index total. The commodities component was up a moderate
0.2 percent, held down by discounting in several categories, notably for
apparel, toys, and house furnishings. However, new car prices rose 1
percent further, as higher-priced (and less discounted) 1990 models
continued to be phased into the CPI sample. More widespread discounting of
the 1990 models likely will affect the January index. In contrast to
commodities, nonenergy service prices were up 0.5 percent in December, the
same as in November but somewhat above the pace earlier last year.
At the producer level, the PPI for finished goods excluding food and
energy rose 0.6 percent in December, of which 0.2 percentage point reflected
a jump in prices of tobacco products.5 Prices of intermediate materials
(also excluding food and energy) were down 0.4 percent, as sharp declines
for nonferrous metals more than offset increases for some of the more
processed materials. The PPI for crude nonfood materials less energy fell
1.8 percent, mainly reflecting declines for metal scrap and ores. Since the
mid-December pricing date for the PPI, the domestic indexes of commodity

the BLS seasonal factors do not correspond to the current monthly pattern.

prices based mainly on industrial materials have registered relatively small
net changes, although a hint of renewed softness in industrial metals prices
seemed apparent late in January.
For 1989 as a whole, the major price indexes rose a bit more than they
did in 1988. The increase in the CPI was 4.6 percent, compared with
4.4 percent the year before; producer prices of finished goods were up
4.8 percent in 1989--about 3/4 of a percentage point more than in the
preceding year. In both the CPI and PPI, energy prices picked up sharply,
and food prices rose 5 percent or more for the second year in a row.
Developments in other sectors were mixed; on the whole, the restraining
influence of import prices was largely offset by labor cost pressures.
At the consumer level, the effect of moderating import prices showed up
in the prices of commodities other than food and energy, which, after rising
4 percent over the course of 1988, slowed to a pace of 2-3/4 percent in
1989. Deceleration was notable for apparel, house furnishings, and sporting
goods. By contrast, the prices of nonenergy services, which are relatively
insulated from foreign competition, rose 5-1/4 percent in 1989, somewhat
above the 5 percent increase in 1988. Price increases picked up last year
for a variety of services, including medical, entertainment, rents, and
airfares. All told, the 1989 rise in the CPI excluding food and energy was
4.4 percent; increases in this measure of underlying price change have been
in the range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent in all but one of the last eight
years.
The PPI for capital equipment rose 3-3/4 percent in 1989, slightly more
than in 1988 and well above the rates in preceding years. This contrasts

with import prices for capital goods--which decelerated markedly last year--
as well as with recent price trends for intermediate materials. The PPI for
(nonfood, nonenergy) intermediate materials was relatively flat during most
of 1989--with a net increase of about 1 percent--after rising at about a 7
percent rate for more than a year. Reflecting in part the sluggish pace of
industrial activity, prices have dropped back steeply for nonferrous metals
and have declined or slowed for a variety of other materials. Prices of
crude nonfood materials less energy retreated 3-3/4 percent during 1989--
mainly reflecting sharp declines for scrap metal--after a climb of about two
years.
Wages and Compensation
Labor cost pressures did not abate in 1989. The employment cost index
(ECI) showed a rise in compensation for private industry workers of
4.8 percent last year--virtually the same as the previous year's increase.
The rise in wages and salaries was a little above 4 percent in both 1988 and
1989, and the rise in benefits exceeded 6 percent in both years. With
regard to benefits, the big 1988 increase in the social security tax rate
was not repeated last year. However, the cost of health care continued to
surge; a 13 percent increase last year was almost as big as the 15 percent
hike of 1988.
Growth of hourly compensation in the service-producing sector continued
to outpace that in the goods-producing industries in 1989. The largest gain
was recorded in health services, no doubt reflecting the rapid growth of
labor demand in that area.

Compensation of union employees rose 3.7 percent in 1989, while that of
nonunion workers increased 5.1 percent. The faster rate of increase in non-
union compensation extended a trend that began in 1983 and resulted in a
further narrowing of the gap between union and nonunion wages. For non-
union workers, the 1989 rise in the wage portion of compensation--
4.5 percent--was the same as in 1988; union wages accelerated by nearly a
percentage point, from 2.2 percent in 1988 to 3.1 percent in 1989.
An acceleration in union wages also was apparent in the 1989 data on
major collective bargaining agreements--those covering 1,000 workers or
more. The first-year wage adjustments in these contracts picked up from a
pace of 2.5 percent in 1988 to 4.0 percent in 1989. When the same parties
last negotiated two or three years ago, first-year wage adjustments were
only 2.1 percent. Nearly half of the union workers involved in major
settlements received wage gains of 4 percent or more last year, compared
with 28 percent of those bargaining in the previous year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Yields on intermediate- and long-term securities have risen sharply
since the December FOMC meeting. Some stronger than anticipated economic
data and soaring food and energy prices have been interpreted by market
participants as intensifying inflation risks and prompting a more cautious
attitude toward easing on the part of the Federal Reserve; statements by
System officials have reinforced this view. In addition, traders have
expressed concern that rising bond rates in Japan and Europe might divert
private capital from dollar-denominated assets. Stock prices approached new
highs at the start of the year, but since have fallen to levels 6 percent or
more below those prevailing in mid-December, buffeted by disappointing
earnings reports and higher bond rates.
In the money markets, the federal funds rate was reduced
1/4 percentage point just after the December FOMC meeting and has been
trading at 8-1/4 percent since then. Other private market yields have
declined too, and on January 8 commercial banks reduced the prime rate
1/2 percentage point to 10 percent. Treasury bill rates have risen somewhat
over the intermeeting period as the market's reassessment of the outlook for
monetary policy has begun to outweigh the effects of the easing in December.
In addition, concerns that RTC working capital needs would add to the supply
of short-term government obligations may have been a factor boosting bill
rates relative to private money market rates.
Monetary expansion has slowed considerably in January. Ml has
contracted, M2 has decelerated to a 4 percent rate of growth, and M3 eked
out a gain of only 2 percent at an annual rate. Household liquidity seems

not to have suffered, however; money market funds, and savings and MMDAs
have continued to expand briskly.
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses was quite soft in December and
January, with strength in commercial paper only partially offsetting
weakness in bank lending and public bond offerings. Limited information
suggests that household debt finished the past year with a slight pickup in
growth, stemming from a bulge in consumer debt and a flatness in mortgage
borrowing. Borrowing by state and local governments surged in December, but
it has dropped off sharply early this year, partly because the backup in
interest rates has discouraged advance refunding. Federal borrowing, not
seasonally adjusted, has moved lower this year as well, coinciding with a
reduced first-quarter deficit. Emerging concerns over credit quality have
begun to affect the availability of some types of credit, particularly for
highly leveraged businesses and for construction projects.
Monetary Aggregates
Ml contracted at a 4 percent annual rate in January, in sharp
contrast to the 12 percent gain in December. 1 The weakness reflects
largely a turnaround in demand deposits, which fell at nearly a 24 percent
pace in January after rising at a 10 percent rate in December. A similar
pattern--of strength relative to trend in December and weakness in January--
can be seen in demand deposits last year and in other checkable deposits
this year, suggesting the possibility of an emerging seasonal pattern in

seasonal factors will be incorporated in the Bluebook. Also, the
revised aggregates will be calculated to remove deposits denominated in
foreign currencies, which were authorized by the Board, effective
January 1, 1990. By preliminary indications, such deposits totaled $61
million in Ml, $111 million in M2, and $1.3 billion in M3 in the week
ended January 8.

transactions deposits around the turn of the year that has not yet been
captured in seasonal factors. The innovations in cash management or banking
practices that might account for such a change have not been pinned down,
but a shift from the use of compensating balances to the payment of fees for
transactions services may be partly responsible.
The deceleration of M2 in January is attributable arithmetically to
the fall in M1, as the non-M1 component of M2 roughly maintained its
December pace. Inflows to both small time deposits and MMDA and savings
components were strong at commercial banks in January; indeed, the combined
growth rate of these deposits stayed close to the 11 percent pace of the
fourth quarter. At thrifts, such deposits picked up in January after a
small decline in the fourth quarter, as flows into adequately capitalized
thrifts outstripped further runoffs at insolvent institutions. Despite the
steepening of the market yield curve recently, yields on small time deposits
continued to slip relative to rates on savings deposits and MMDAs (see
chart), extending a trend that began last spring and that is largely
responsible for rising shares of liquid deposits in household portfolios.
The non-M2 component of M3 contracted more slowly in January than
it did in December, primarily because of large inflows to institution-only
MMMFs. Most of these inflows occurred in the early part of the month when,
owing to the drop in short-term rates with the System's easing in late
December, MMMFs enjoyed a wider yield advantage over comparable market
instruments. The ongoing shrinkage in managed liabilities at thrifts
continued in January, as adequately capitalized institutions ran off high-
cost borrowed funds in response to larger inflows of core deposits, and
thinly capitalized and insolvent thrifts pared their balance sheets further.

III-7
At commercial banks, large time deposits were quite weak in December and
January, a consequence of healthy increases in core deposits and pronounced
weakness in bank credit.
Bank Credit
Bank credit contracted at a 2-3/4 percent annual rate in December,
the first decline in this series since the second quarter of 1980 when
credit controls were in effect. A sharp drop in merger-related lending,
together with net paydowns of existing merger loans, contributed to a plunge
in business loans in December. Although early indications point to some
bounce-back in merger-related lending in January, overall business lending
at banks apparently remained sluggish. Nevertheless, preliminary evidence
suggests that bank credit expanded at a moderate 5 percent annual rate in
January, boosted by a rebound in holdings of government securities and
expansion in real estate and consumer loans.
Thrift Institutions
SAIF-insured thrift institutions became subject to FIRREA-mandated
minimum capital standards in early December. The standards, set by the
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), have three components: a 1.5 percent
tangible capital requirement, a 3 percent leverage requirement, and a
6.4 percent risk-based requirement. Based upon third-quarter balance
sheets, it is estimated that 507 solvent thrifts failed to meet at least one
of the requirements, and as a result will not be permitted to grow and will
have to file a compliance plan with the OTS. The leverage requirement
represented the greatest shortfall; absent an infusion of capital, thrifts
2. The risk-based requirement rises to 7.2 percent in 1991 and to its
final level of 8 percent in 1992. An interest-rate risk component will
eventually be incorporated in the calculation of risk-based capital.

failing this requirement needed to reduce assets roughly $88 billion to be
in compliance.
Thrifts have been taking dramatic steps to meet the new
requirements. The 507 undercapitalized thrifts pared their assets by
$19 billion during the third quarter in anticipation of the new capital
standards, with the bulk of the reduction coming in mortgage-backed
securities. On the liability side of the balance sheet, these thrifts made
sizable reductions in nondeposit sources of funds, especially in repurchase
agreements, but experienced only modest declines in deposits.
The thrift industry suffered a loss of $3.8 billion in the third
quarter, largely driven by $4 billion in provisions for loan losses.
Although such provisions declined by nearly $3/4 billion among thrifts in
conservatorship, they were offset by higher provisions at some healthier
thrifts. Net operating earnings at SAIF-insured thrifts worsened slightly
in the third quarter, after moving into the red in the second quarter.
Reflecting falling interest rates, interest expenses generally declined over
the quarter, but this improvement was offset by continued high funding costs
at thrifts in conservatorship and lower gross operating income at other
thrifts (resulting from asset sell-offs).
Business Finance
Total borrowing by nonfinancial firms has weakened noticeably since
the last FOMC meeting. Higher long-term interest rates and greater investor
caution towards low-rated debt slowed the issuance of corporate bonds, and
business borrowing at banks recovered only a bit in January. In contrast to
these areas of weakness, commercial paper outstanding from nonfinancial
firms has continued to grow rapidly. The strong growth in commercial paper--

III-10
amounting to 30 percent last year--has been associated with heavy inflows to
money market funds, the largest purchasers of commercial paper. A $58
billion increase in commercial paper holdings by MMMFs over the first eleven
months of 1989 (latest data available) accounted for 90 percent of net
commercial paper issuance in the period.
The junk bond market has remained edgy, as prices generally have
fallen in reaction to weakness in the equity market, to uncertainty
surrounding the Campeau bankruptcy that spilled over to other highly
leveraged retailers, and to Moody's unexpected downgrading of RJR's debt.
In late January, yields on RJR bonds jumped 2 to 5 percentage points; yields
on other junk bonds rose about 60 basis points. Junk bond issuance has been
light since the beginning of November, and the volume of prospective issues
has continued to shrink, largely because of the slowdown in debt-financed
mergers that began last summer. With announcements of new merger proposals
remaining sparse, equity retirements in the first quarter are expected to
drop below the fourth quarter's reduced volume. The $14 billion Time-Warner
merger was completed in January with an exchange of preferred stock for the
remaining Warner common shares.
Defaults on low-rated bonds were about $8 billion in 1989, with
more than $2.5 billion occurring in November and December; defaults in 1990
may be substantial as well, for the total already includes about
$2.5 billion from the Campeau bankruptcy. More generally, credit quality,
as measured by rating downgrades relative to upgrades, continued to erode in
the fourth quarter of 1989. While industrial firms displayed the most
serious signs of financial distress, new concern also arose about credit
quality at financial institutions. Two investment banks were downgraded

III-11
because of their exposure to the junk bond market, and debt ratings of
several New England banks were lowered when the deterioration in their
holdings of real estate loans became evident.
After rallying in early January, major stock price indexes have
retreated and now stand about 5 to 6 percent below their levels in mid-
December. Stock price volatility measured by intra-day fluctuations has
increased noticeably since the last FOMC meeting. Day-to-day volatility
also has increased, as exemplified by declines of about 2-1/2 percent in
major indexes on January 12, after an unfavorable PPI report and
retrenchment in the Japanese stock market, and on January 22, apparently in
response to disappointing fourth-quarter earnings reports and rising long-
term interest rates. Gross equity offerings by nonfinancial firms, which
were strong in early December, have all but dried up since then.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff projects that the federal government will run a
$59 billion deficit in the first quarter, down from $70 billion last
quarter. Net cash borrowing from the public is expected to slow to about
$51 billion, and the Treasury is expected to draw its cash balance down to a
low level, as it usually does in the first quarter, in anticipation of April
tax inflows.
Partial data for the fourth quarter of 1989 show a pickup in
borrowing by government-sponsored enterprises to about $5-1/2 billion. The
Federal Home Loan Banks continued to pay down debt, but borrowings by Fannie
Mae and other agencies, and the initial issue from REFCORP, more than offset
the reduction of $7.5 billion in FHLB debt.

Over the second half of 1989, FHLB debt declined about 13 percent.
Further declines for the first quarter of 1990 appear likely, in view of
another $1.3 billion net paydown in January. Spreads on FHLB securities
issued in January were generally in line with recent offerings.
REFCORP issued the first $4.5 billion of its $30 billion
authorization in October. That 30-year issue traded in a fairly narrow
range of 23 to 28 basis points over comparable Treasury securities until
widening some on the January 17 announcement that REFCORP would auction
$5 billion of 40-year bonds. The new 40-year bond met with a relatively
poor reception when auctioned January 23; it was an unfamiliar issue sold at
a time when market participants were reassessing their previously bullish
expectations for bond prices. The 40-year bond sold at a higher-than-
expected 8.60 percent average yield, and initially traded at a spread of
about 28 basis points over the 30-year Treasury bond, a spread much wider
than had characterized when-issued trading on the morning of the auction.
However, the spread has since narrowed to around 23 basis points. REFCORP
currently plans to issue $5 billion of securities each quarter until it
exhausts its borrowing authority.
Fannie Mae's debt increased $4.6 billion during the fourth quarter
of 1989, as it financed a portfolio of mortgages that grew to about
$110 billion by year-end. Freddie Mac, which holds a far smaller mortgage
portfolio, has engaged in little net borrowing since the end of the third
quarter. Concerns about real estate credit quality have taken their toll on
the prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock. Although prices of both
equities are above year-earlier levels, Fannie Mae's stock is down 35
percent from its early-October peak, and Freddie Mac stock is 43 percent

III-14
below its October high. The credit quality concerns reflected in these
significant declines in stock prices have not shown up in the agencies'
borrowing costs, however. The spreads on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt
have not changed appreciably in recent months.
Municipal Securities
In December, gross issuance of long-term municipal securities
surged to nearly $13 billion, the highest monthly rate of the year.
Refunding, stimulated by interest rate declines early in the month, and new
capital offerings both picked up sharply. The new capital offerings
consisted primarily of revenue bonds intended to finance education and
housing. Total long-term issuance in January is expected to taper off to
$6 billion or less, with refunding in particular damped by the backup of
interest rates.

Despite the revenue shortfalls that plague a number of northeastern
and mid-Atlantic states, the credit quality of the general obligation debt
of municipalities overall improved in 1989. The states of Oregon, Michigan,
and California received higher ratings, as did the debts of Cleveland and
Boston. The heavily publicized downgrade of Massachusetts debt--to Baa-1 in
Moody's ratings--by itself accounted for $8.3 billion of the $13.7 billion
of tax-exempt debt downgraded during 1989.
Changes in revenue bond ratings were mixed in 1989. Downgrades for
housing and health-care bonds outnumbered upgrades, as they had in 1988, but
upgrades were somewhat more numerous than downgrades for education, airport,
and tax-backed issues. Downgrades were especially prevalent in the
Northeast and in Colorado, reflecting weak real estate markets. Upgrades of
revenue issues were prominent in southern states and in California.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage interest rates have increased since the December FOMC
meeting, though by less than yields on comparable Treasury securities. In
the primary market, the average contract rate on new commitments for
conventional fixed-rate home loans has risen 30 basis points. Secondary
market yields have risen somewhat over the intermeeting period, suggesting
further increases in commitment rates in the near term. Mortgage rates have
moved up less than Treasury yields in recent weeks, partly reflecting
reduced prepayment risks in an environment of higher interest rates.
Overall growth in mortgage debt in the fourth quarter appears to
have been maintained at about the 9 percent annual rate experienced in the
third quarter, judging from partial data. Thrift institutions continue to
shed mortgage assets, especially pass-through securities. Between April and

November, total mortgage assets of SAIF-insured institutions declined at
about a 12 percent annual rate. In contrast, funds provided by other
mortgage lenders grew at well above a 10 percent annual rate during this
period.
Problems with defaulted loans have precipitated changes recently in
some federal housing programs. HUD has announced plans to end its co-
insurance programs for multifamily housing, which accumulated an estimated
$1 billion in defaulted mortgages during its six-year existence.
Freddie Mac has tightened requirements for its multifamily mortgage
programs, citing losses disproportionate to the size of the programs. It
has lowered the maximum loan-to-value ratio on loans it will purchase from
85 to 70 percent of appraised value, and it has imposed a more conservative
minimum servicing spread.
On the whole, the default problems of the housing agencies do not
appear to be characteristic of the broader home mortgage market. Although
the home mortgage delinquency rates reported by the Mortgage Bankers
Association rose during the third quarter, the rise was the first in several
quarters and was concentrated in the 30-day category that is considered more
3. Under the multifamily coinsurance programs, eligible lenders
performed underwriting, servicing, management, and property disposition
functions and assumed responsibility for a portion of any insurance loss
(up to a maximum of approximately 20 percent of the loan). Because of
basic weaknesses in the programs, involving inadequate levels of capital
and deficient coinsurer monitoring, a substantial portion of the losses
incurred have been borne by the FHA.

subject to statistical aberrations. The delinquency rate on home
mortgages past due 60 days or more, a measure of more serious payment
problems, increased just 0.08 percentage points to 1.60 percent, which is
still relatively low compared with levels near 2.0 percent a few years ago
(chart). The bulk of the real estate problems experienced recently by
institutions in the Northeast and certain other areas appears to have been
concentrated in loans for construction or development.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding is estimated to have
increased at about a 10 percent annual rate in December, lifting the fourth-
quarter rate to 8 percent, up fairly sharply from the third quarter. Growth
in December owed mainly to a large jump in revolving credit. This component
is particularly volatile in December and January because the proportions of
Christmas season transactions entering lenders' books in each of these
months can vary substantially from year to year, complicating seasonal
adjustment.
Some evidence, most of it pertaining to the third quarter, suggests
that repayment performance on consumer loans may have deteriorated some last
year. At commercial banks, according to the American Bankers Association,
the average 30-day delinquency rate for all closed-end types of consumer
loans climbed nearly 1/2 percentage point in the third quarter to the
4. Home mortgages delinquent 30 days or more rose 1/2 percentage point
in the third quarter to just over 5 percent of loans outstanding. Some
industry participants attributed this increase to stepped-up selling by
lenders of the servicing function on the mortgages they hold. When the
servicing of a mortgage is sold, the mortgagees often fail at first to
send their payments to the new servicer, and the original lender may be
slow in forwarding payments. If the new servicer does not receive the
payment within 30 days of the due date the loan becomes classified as
delinquent.

highest level since 1980. The magnitude of the jump seems questionable
because only one minor component (mobile homes) rose as much as the total.
However, all components showed significant increases, so that the direction
of movement seems clearly upward. Delinquencies reported on the Call Report
by banks with more than $300 million in assets showed a much smaller rise
than the ABA series in the third quarter, but also were high by historical
standards.
The captive auto finance companies reported another sizable rise in
loan delinquencies in the third quarter, and then little further change in
October and November. The average for those two months--2.58 percent--has
been exceeded in only four quarters since the series was begun in 1967, all
coming during the 1970 and 1974-75 recessionary periods. The steady
lengthening of maturities on auto loan contracts in recent years may account
for some secular updrift in delinquencies. The longer the maturity, other
things equal, the longer a car owner's equity remains negative, a condition
that reduces the incentive to keep loans current. But delinquency rates at
the captives also have been greatly affected by shifts in the mix of
customers at these companies under the various sales incentive programs in
recent years, and may not accurately reflect movements in auto loan quality
as a whole. When the programs featured low-rate financing in the mid-1980s,
the companies attracted many low-risk borrowers, and delinquency rates
subsequently dropped. Under the more recent emphasis on car-price rebates,
lower-risk borrowers have usually chosen the rebate alternative and obtained
financing elsewhere, restoring the captives to their more traditional role
of lending to higher-risk borrowers. Accordingly, delinquency rates at the
captives have climbed again.

III-22
Personal bankruptcies have been increasing rapidly through most of
the current expansion, partly because of changes in federal and state law
that make bankruptcy a more attractive alternative to debtors for dealing
with financial distress. In the third quarter, however, personal bankruptcy
filings declined somewhat from the second quarter.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. Merchandise Trade
Preliminary data for November of last year indicate that the
deficit on U.S. merchandise trade widened slightly further to $10.5
billion (on a seasonally adjusted, Census basis, customs valuation),
from the $10.2 billion revised deficit registered in October. On a
seasonally adjusted balance of payments basis, the combined October-
November deficit exceeded the deficit recorded in the third quarter of
1989 by nearly $20 billion (at an annual rate), as imports rose strongly
and exports were essentially unchanged.

While total exports were about unchanged in October-November
compared with the third quarter in both value and quantity, the
composition of exports changed significantly. The strike at Boeing from
early October to late November disrupted shipments of aircraft, reducing
exports by an estimated $6 billion at an annual rate during the fourth
quarter. This decline was offset by increases in exports of a broad
array of other products, notably energy, certain metals, semiconductors,
telecommunications equipment, automobiles, and consumer goods. A small
increase in agricultural exports was led by an increase in the quantity
of corn shipped to the Soviet Union.
Total imports increased rapidly in October-November, rising over 4
percent in value compared with the third quarter of 1989, with almost
all of the increase in non-oil categories. Imports of capital goods
were especially strong, including computers, semiconductors, aircraft
and parts, and other machinery; imports of consumer goods and industrial
supplies showed smaller increases. Most of the increase was in terms of
quantity, as prices of non-oil imports rose only moderately. Declines
in the relative price of non-oil imports associated with the rise in the
dollar earlier in 1989 probably contributed significantly to the strong
growth in the quantity of imports.
The value of oil imports was about unchanged in October-November,
as higher prices were mostly offset by a moderate decline in the
quantity of imports. Oil import prices reached $17.55 in November, when
West Texas spot prices of crude petroleum were running $19.82 per
barrel. The cold snap and associated refinery mishaps in the United
States pushed the spot price up further to $23.35 per barrel by the

IV-4
third week of December. Since that time, prices have been volatile and
strengthened somewhat on news of supply disruptions in the centrally
planned economies.

Import and Export Prices
As reported by the BLS, the average price of imports rose almost 5
percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1989, as price
increases were recorded across most major categories of trade. Oil
prices increased over 30 percent, reversing the decline registered in
the third quarter, and continuing the upward trend from the first half
of the year. Increasing prices of non-oil products in the fourth
quarter -- particularly foods -- reversed part of the decline during the
second and third quarters of 1989. Prices of imported commodities tend
to be more volatile than the prices of imported capital goods, consumer
goods, and automotive products.
Export prices declined slightly in the fourth quarter, as a small
increase in the average price of nonagricultural exports was offset by a
large decline in the prices of agricultural exports. Prices of exported
capital goods, consumer goods, and automotive products rose slightly in
nearly every month of 1989, and at about the same rate as comparable
domestic prices. This suggests that the exporters of these products

allow foreign-currency prices to vary along with the exchange value of
the dollar. In contrast, prices of most exported industrial supplies
have fallen steadily since mid-year, but at rates less than those of
domestic prices. It appears that pricing decisions of U.S. exporters of
industrial supplies have been influenced by the decline in the dollar's
value.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Recorded capital flow data for October and November 1989 show net
capital inflows in the first two months of the fourth quarter coming
primarily in the form of foreign net purchases of private and government
securities. However, the data available to date account for less than
one-half of the estimated current account deficit for this period.
Foreigners reduced their holdings of corporate stocks in November
for the first time since February (line 2b of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table). This followed the downturn in the
U.S. stock market in mid-October.
Concomitant with the drop in foreign holdings of stocks in November
was an $11 billion increase in foreign holdings of corporate and agency
bonds and U.S. Treasury obligations (lines 2a and 3). Of particular
interest is the degree to which this change was concentrated in U.S.
government obligations; in addition to the $6.6 billion increase in the
holdings of Treasury obligations (line 3), private foreigners purchased
$1.5 billion of the bonds and notes of U.S. government agencies and
corporations (included in line 2a). In recent years foreign purchases
of Treasury securities have been correlated with the size of the
Treasury's mid-quarter refunding; in November, foreigners increased

their holdings of Treasury coupon bonds by $6.5 billion, a typical 50
percent of the sizeable $13 billion refunding. (These net purchases are
frequently followed by net sales in subsequent periods.)
Foreign official holdings in the United States were virtually
unchanged in November, although G-10 holdings increased by $2.6 billion
(line 4). Partial data from the FRBNY for December show no change in
G-10 holdings.
A moderate net inflow of $4.3 billion for banking offices in
November partially reversed the large net outflow in the previous month
(line 1 of the Summary table). Line 1 of the table on International
Banking Data suggests little change in December in the net positions of
banking offices in the United States vis-a-vis their IBFs and offices
abroad. Lending by foreign branches of U.S. banks to U.S. nonbanks
(line 2) shows virtually no change in November and December. Credit
extended by U.S.-based banks was at about the same level in December
1989 as it had been in December 1988. In contrast, borrowing by U.S.
residents from other foreign sources appears to have increased. Reports
from foreign agencies and branches on the custody liabilities of U.S.
customers to banks outside the United States show that loans to U.S.
residents booked at offshore offices of foreign banks increased by $1
billion in November. The increase for the eleven-month period from the
end of December 1988 to the end of November was $7.6 billion. These
totals are incomplete, however, because they only include those loans
where the U.S. office of the foreign agency or branch arranges the loan,
acts as the U.S. address, or services the loan for the foreign lender.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the December FOMC meeting, the weighted-average foreign
exchange value of the dollar has declined 2-1/2 percent, on balance, as
shown in the accompanying chart. The dollar declined in late December
amid perceptions that the Federal Reserve had eased monetary conditions,
but then moved up, on balance, through mid-January as anticipations of
further easing faded. Since mid-January, the dollar has depreciated.
The dollar's movements against individual currencies were mixed.
Overall, the German mark continued to be buoyed by developments in
Eastern Europe -- which included the overthrow of the Romanian
government and the acceleration of elections in East Germany -- rising
3-1/2 percent against the dollar. The Swiss franc appreciated 4-1/2
percent against the dollar as the Swiss National Bank aggressively
tightened monetary conditions further to defend its currency, which had
depreciated substantially against the mark during 1989. Three-month
interbank rates in Switzerland have risen more than 110 basis points
since the December FOMC meeting and 250 basis points since mid-1989.
After continuing to weaken over much of the intermeeting period, the yen
recovered in late January as the outlook for the governing LDP party in
the February 18 election of the Lower House of Parliament improved; on
net, the yen was little changed against the dollar. Meanwhile, the
Canadian dollar fell 2-1/2 percent against the U.S. dollar as the Bank
of Canada allowed short-term interest rates to ease slightly from peak
levels amid signs of weakening in the Canadian economy.
Apart from Switzerland, changes in short-term rates generally were
modest. Although the Bank of Japan raised its discount rate 1/2

percentage point to 4-1/4 percent on December 25, this move was
generally anticipated; 3-month CD rates in Japan increased only 1/4
percentage point for the intermeeting period as a whole, with most of
the rise occurring since the beginning of the year. On balance, 3-month
interbank rates in Germany were little changed, and comparable rates in
the United States eased.
Prices of bonds and equities (the bottom panel of the chart)
declined sharply worldwide after the first of the year. Since the
December FOMC meeting, bond yields in Japan have risen 100 basis points,
on balance, after having been up nearly 130 basis points through
mid-January. Long-term interest rates increased about 75 basis points
in the United States and were up 50-60 basis points in the United
Kingdom, Germany, and Canada. Stock prices fell 5 to 10 percent in
major markets during most of January, but prices in Japan and Europe,
particularly Germany, recovered somewhat toward the end of the month.

other EMS currencies except the Spanish peseta. Since then, the lira
has strengthened somewhat,
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recently the pace of economic activity in the major foreign
industrial nations has varied, suggesting that tighter monetary policy
has taken hold in some, but not all, of these countrie .In the fourth
quarter of 1989, available data on activity for Japan showed a mixed
performance while most indicators for Germany, France, and Italy pointed
to renewed strength. German officials have stated that real GDP growth
(on an annual average basis) probably exceeded 4 percent in 1989, the
strongest rate of expansion in the decade. In contrast, recent growth
has been sluggish in both the United Kingdom and Canada.
Inflation abroad appears to have steadied in recent months, but in
1989 as a whole, prices rose considerably more than th y did in the
previous year. In December, the 12-month rate of consumer price
inflation was roughly one percentage point higher than a year earlier in
most of the major foreign industrial economies. On this basis, Japanese
consumer price inflation was 3.3 percent in January, more than double
the year-ago rate. During 1989, the external surplus diminished in
Japan and remained about the same in Germany, while larger deficits
emerged in the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, and France.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, strong growth appears to have
continued in the fourth quarter, but the latest indica ors of economic
activity have been mixed. Some slowing was suggested by industrial
production (s.a.), which fell 0.1 percent in December, and retail sales
(s.a.), which declined 4.5 percent in November, almost completely

reversing the increase of the previous two months. However, in November
the unemployment rate (s.a.) declined to 2.2 percent and the
ratio of job offers to applicants increased slightly, indicating some
further tightening of labor market conditions.

Inflation showed little trend in the fourth quarter. In 1989 as a
whole, however, inflation was up sharply. In the 12 months to December,
consumer prices in the Tokyo area rose 3 percent, substantially above
the 1.2 percent increase in the comparable period of 1988. About 1-1/4
percentage points of the increase in inflation stemmed from the
introduction of a consumption tax in 1989. Wholesale prices increased
3.9 percent in the 12 months to December, compared with a 1.1 percent
decline during 1988. Oil price increases and weakness of the yen also
contributed to the rise in inflation last year. Wholesale prices of
domestically produced goods rose 2.5 percent between December 1988 and
December 1989, while those of imported goods jumped 13 percent. In
January, consumer prices were up a further 0.3 percent. There is
concern that cost pressures may heighten after the upcoming spring wage
round; Japan's largest labor confederation has indicated that it will
seek wage increases of 8 to 9 percent. Last spring, initial wage

IV-18
demands were 6 to 8 percent, and actual wage increases averaged 5.1
percent.
The trade surplus (s.a.) declined further in December. For 1989
as a whole, the trade surplus was about $64.8 billion, down from $77.4
billion in 1988. In volume terms, exports grew 4.4 percent in 1989 (the
same rate of increase as the previous year), while imports rose 7.7
percent (down from a 16.7 percent increase the previous year).
In December, the cabinet approved and forwarded to the Diet its
proposed budget for FY 1990 (beginning in April). The proposal contains
no significant fiscal initiatives, and its likely macroeconomic effect
should be neutral to mildly contractionary. Diet debate over the budget
is expected to begin in March, after Lower House elections scheduled for
February 18.
In Germany, industrial production (s.a.) increased 0.4 percent in
November, after stagnating in the previous two months. New orders also
recovered in November; the volume of foreign orders (s.a.) increased 4.3
percent, largely offsetting October's 5.5 percent decline. Despite
considerable immigration from Eastern Europe, principally East Germany,
the unemployment rate (s.a.) declined from 7.9 percent in November to
7.8 percent in December. The flood of immigrants from East Germany is
continuing with 45,000 East Germans emigrating to West Germany in
January.
The recent pattern of inflation has been mixed. Import prices
declined 0.5 percent in December to a level 0.9 percent above the level
a year ago. Producer prices were unchanged in December, while wholesale
prices increased 0.4 percent. In January, consumer prices rose 0.5

percent, but the 12-month rate of consumer price inflation fell to 2.6
percent from 3 percent in December as the effect of increased indirect
taxes in January 1989 dropped out of the measured inflation rate. M3
increased 4.7 percent in 1989 (s.a., Q4/Q4), and therefore the
Bundesbank met its monetary growth target for the first time since 1985.

Germany's trade surplus (n.s.a.) widened in November but was
accompanied by a sharp rise in transfer payments so that the current
account surplus rose by less. The cumulative totals for the trade
balance and current account through November (a.r.) are $71.9 billion
and $53.8 billion, respectively. This compares with $72.9 billion and
$48.7 billion for all of 1988.
After slower growth in the third quarter of 1989, economic
activity showed signs of renewed strength in France. In October and
November, industrial production (s.a.) recovered strongly from its
unusually low level in September (when automobile workers were on
strike); on a year-to-year basis, industrial production was up 3.3
percent in November. Surveys point to a continuation of the current
investment boom, with corporate investment expected to grow 14 to 15
percent in 1990 after rising 13 percent in 1989.

IV-20
The trade deficit has continued to widen. For the eleven months
through November of 1989, the cumulative deficit (s.a.a.r.) was $7.4
billion compared with a deficit of $5.1 billion in the same period of
1988. This deficit has been counterbalanced by a widening surplus in
services, due primarily to record earnings from tourism, so that
deterioration in the current account in 1989 was probably smaller.
M2 growth through November 1989 was in the middle of the 4-6
percent target range for 1989. The Bank of France reduced the target
range for 1990 to 3.5-5.5 percent to further tighten monetary policy and
discourage inflation. Recently, inflation has been slowing; in December
the CPI rose 0.1 percent and was up 3.6 percent from a year earlier
compared with a rate of 3.1 percent in December 1988.
The pace of Italian economic activity picked up in the third
quarter of 1989, as GDP rose 3.2 percent (s.a.a.r), roughly twice the
rate registered in the second quarter. This strength appears to have
continued into the fourth quarter. Industrial production (s.a.) rose
0.5 percent in November, following a 1.6 percent rise in October. The
inflation rate decreased in January, with the consumer price index
rising at a 12-month rate of 6.3 percent, down from peak rates of 7
percent last summer. The wholesale price index also reflected this
general slowing trend in inflation; in November, it was 5.7 percent
(n.s.a.) above its year-ago level, down from a rate of 6.5 percent in
October.
The Italian government passed the 1990 budget on December 21, the
first time in several years that this has been accomplished before the
beginning of the fiscal year. In January, the government announced a

IV-21
series of measures to centralize control over public expenditures.
These include a requirement that all new spending laws introduced by
ministers be approved by the Prime Minister, and a sharp reduction in
appropriations set aside to fund additional spending approved during the
year. Upcoming local elections in June may make these efforts to
restrain spending more difficult.
In the United Kingdom, industrial production (s.a.) fell 0.5
percent in November to a level only 0.6 percent above the year-ago
level. However, in December the volume of retail sales (s.a.) was
unexpectedly strong, rising 2.2 percent after falling 0.4 percent in
November while the unemployment rate (s.a.) remained at 5.8 percent,
well below its year-earlier level of 7.1 percent. The 12-month rate of
retail price inflation was 7.7 percent in December, compared with a rate
of 6.8 percent in December 1988. Producer prices increased by 5 percent
in the 12 months to December. Persistent wage pressures along with
slowing productivity growth have caused an escalation of unit labor
costs. The underlying 12-month rate of increase of average earnings was
9.25 percent in November. In January, Ford autoworkers agreed to a 10.2
percent pay raise, sending a potentially inflationary signal to other
unions that traditionally emulate the Ford agreement.
The U.K. current account registered a record deficit of $33.8
billion in 1989, compared with a $26 billion deficit in 1988. However,
in recent months the trade and current account gaps have narrowed as
exports have grown much faster than imports.
Expansion in Canada appears to be slowing considerably.
Industrial production (s.a.) fell 1.2 percent in October, but rebounded

IV-22
0.7 percent in November to a level only 0.8 percent above a year ago.
Total Canadian bankruptcies in November were 19.2 percent above a year
ago. The unemployment rate (s.a.) increased to 7.7 percent in December
from a low of 7.3 percent in September as employment declined. The
consumer price index (n.s.a.) declined 0.1 percent in December, but the
12-month rate remained above 5 percent. In recent months, imports have
fallen sharply and in November the merchandise trade balance (s.a.)
rebounded into a surplus of $600 million. The cumulative trade balance
(s.a.a.r.) through November was $4.5 billion compared with a surplus of
$8 billion for all of 1988.
Developments in East European Economies
Poland and Yugoslavia have implemented radical economic reform
programs, both in cooperation with the IMF. The programs are intended
to move the countries toward market economies and to reduce inflation.
Between December 1988 and December 1989, Polish inflation soared to 740
percent, while industrial output appears to have contracted. In
December, Poland signed a letter of intent for a 13-month, $725 million,
IMF stand-by arrangement intended to stabilize the economy and support
far-reaching systemic changes. Additional support for Poland has been
provided by the major industrial countries in the form of a $500 million
bridge loan and a $1 billion exchange stabilization fund. Yugoslavia
has implemented a currency reform and devaluation, and has frozen wages
and the exchange rate of the dinar against the mark for up to six
months, in anticipation of an IMF stand-by arrangement. The banking
system and bankruptcy laws are being reformed as well. Economic reform

IV-23
in Yugoslavia has been made more difficult by political divisions that
exist among ethnic regions.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
The bank debt package for Mexico is scheduled to be signed
beginning February 4. The Philippines completed the debt buyback part
of its debt restructuring program, repurchasing $1.3 billion in
commercial bank debt at a 50 percent discount on January 3. Venezuela
continues to negotiate debt restructuring and possible debt and debt-
service reduction with its commercial bank creditors. Inflation in
Argentina has risen and financial conditions have deteriorated. In
Brazil, the present outgoing government is unable to implement measures
to reduce its high inflation rate and has instead concentrated on
maintaining stability in that rate (currently 56 percent per month),
through mid-March, when the next government takes office.
Individual country notes. Banks with about $48.4 billion in
claims on Mexico have made commitments to sign the bank financing
package beginning February 4. The package provides principal reduction,
interest reduction, and new money options. The package will lower net
interest payments by about $1.25 billion in 1990, reduce existing debt
to banks by nearly $7 billion, and provide new bank loans totalling
about $1.4 billion over the next three years. The new money commitments
represent 25 percent of the approximately $5.9 billion in old debt that
will not be exchanged for new bonds.
Mexico will use about $5.7 billion borrowed from the IMF, the
World Bank, and Japan, and about $1.3 billion from its reserves to
enhance the principal and 18 months of interest on $34.5 billion in new

IV-24
bonds that it will issue to non-Mexican banks in exchange for about $41
billion in old debt. Another $670 million in new bonds to be issued
to Mexican banks holding about $1 billion in old debt will not be
enhanced. About $22.5 billion of the new bonds will bear interest at
6.25 percent and will be issued at par. Another $12.7 billion in new
bonds will bear market interest rates and will be issued at a 35 percent
discount on the old debt.
The bank debt package should enable Mexico to hold its current
account deficit in 1990 to an estimated $4.5 billion, about $1 billion
less than in 1989. However, gross international reserves are likely to
decline, unless unexpectedly high foreign direct investment and other
private capital inflows materialize. For now, optimism appears to be
strong, and stock prices have risen by more than 20 percent since a mid-
November 1989 low, encouraged, perhaps, by new government moves to
reduce consumer subsidies. Recent cuts in subsidies led to a tripling
of Mexico City's urban transport fares and a 63 percent increase in
tortilla prices. Reflecting these adjustments, the CPI rose 3.4 percent
in December. This was the highest monthly increase in nearly two years,
but it closed the year at 20 percent over December 1988 compared with 52
percent over the previous 12 months.
On January 3, the Philippines completed the debt buyback part of
its debt restructuring program when $1.3 billion in commercial bank debt
was repurchased at a 50 percent discount. The buyback was financed by
1. For banks whose claims are not in dollars, the interest enhancement
may vary from 18-months depending on the "price" of zero-coupon
obligations in the domestic currency.

IV-25
funds from the IMF, World Bank, Export-Import Bank of Japan, U.S. AID
and indirectly from Brunei. The Philippine government also hopes to
obtain $750 million from its creditor banks from the issue of new money
bonds. As of January 9, $615 million had been pledged by the banks.
Last December, the IMF Board reviewed the Philippine program, granted a
waiver in connection with the growth of the monetary base exceeding its
ceiling, and modified the program slightly.
Venezuela continues to negotiate a debt restructuring and financing
package, including possible debt and debt service reduction, with its
commercial bank creditors. In January 1990, the IMF approved release of
the third disbursement of SDR 170 million (net of the debt-reduction
set-aside) under Venezuela's Extended Fund Facility. Venezuela achieved
the 1989-Q3 targets under its IMF program, except for a shortfall of
more than $300 million in international reserves on account of the
absence of bank financing, for which it received a waiver from the IMF.
The Venezuelan current account moved from a $4-1/2 billion deficit
in 1988 to surplus of about $1 billion in 1989. An 8 percent decline in
real GDP combined with a sharp devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar led
to a cut in imports from $11 billion in 1988 to an estimated $7-1/2
billion last year. At the same time, higher oil and non-oil exports
boosted export revenue by 16 percent, to $12 billion, in 1989.
Consumer prices rose 81 percent in calendar 1989, more than double
the 1988 rate. Much of this increase resulted from the devaluation of
the bolivar and decontrol of prices early in 1989. By the last quarter
of the year, inflation had decelerated sharply, to an annual rate of 27
percent.

IV-26
Inflation in Argentina has accelerated, and financial conditions
have deteriorated. The devaluation and public sector price hikes
announced on December 10, 1989, did not succeed in stabilizing interest
rates or the parallel market exchange rate. As a result, economy
minister Nestor Rapanelli stepped down on December 18 and was replaced
by Antonio Ernan Gonzalez; central bank president Egidio Ianella, who
had been in office less than a month, was replaced by Rudolfo Rossi.
Rossi, who is widely viewed to have been ineffectual as central bank
head, was replaced by Enrique Fulcini on January 22, 1990. Upon taking
office, Gonzalez announced a disinflation strategy that included the
unification and floating of the exchange rate, the elimination of
exchange controls, and the dismantling of price controls. These
measures failed to stem the continuing run on the austral, and the
exchange rate reached almost 2,000 australs per dollar on December 28
compared with 1,000 australs per dollar on December 10 and 650 australs
per dollar in the previous five months.
On January 1, 1990, the government announced a new program to
support the austral that included an involuntary swap of BONEX (long-
term dollar-denominated government debt) for most outstanding austral-
denominated government debt, as well as a swap of BONEX for all holdings
of bank time deposits in excess of one million australs, or about $500.
These measures have strengthened the austral by reducing liquidity, but
have lowered the level of confidence in the banking system and have cut
off all sources of domestic financing of the fiscal deficit. If this
deficit is not reduced substantially in the coming months, money
creation to finance the deficit will probably lead to a resurgence of

IV-27
the hyperinflation experienced during mid-1989. The administration's
tax reform bill was approved by the Argentine Congress in December; it
is uncertain how much additional revenue will result from the new law,
however.
As a result of the devaluations and public sector price increases
implemented during December, inflation in that month registered 40.1
percent compared with 6.5 percent in November and 5.6 percent in
October. January inflation is expected to reach at least 60 percent,
largely reflecting continued adjustment to the cost increases of the
previous month.
In Brazil, the present government is unable to implement the
necessary fiscal measures to reduce its high inflation rate and has
instead concentrated on maintaining stability of that rate through mid-
March. Fernando Collor de Mello, elected president in mid-December, is
expected to introduce an anti-inflation package when he takes office
March 15. Collor has not yet revealed the details of the program and
has not announced his choices for the economic policy officials. His
package is expected to include measures aimed at reducing the fiscal
deficit, the main cause of the high and rising inflation rates.
Consumer prices rose 56 percent in January. The overnight rate in the
government debt market has risen from 60 percent per month in early
January to 74 percent per month January 30. According to preliminary
data, real GDP grew 3-4 percent in 1989, compared with prior estimates
of 1 percent. The unexpectedly high growth rate may be the result of an
underestimation of GDP price deflators due to price controls.

IV-28
The 15 percent real appreciation in the exchange rate and import
liberalization led to a fall in the trade surplus from $19 billion in
1988 to $16 billion in 1989. Reflecting an expectation that the new
government will devalue the official exchange rate, the spread between
the parallel and official exchange rates was about 135 percent between
late December and mid-January, but fell to 110 percent at the end of the
month when the domestic interest rate rose sharply.
In early January, the government increased its restrictions on
capital outflows, and delayed payment of $1 billion to Paris Club
creditors to protect liquid foreign exchange reserves, which are
estimated at about $7 billion at the end of 1989. The waiting period
for repatriation of capital was increased from 4 to 6 months, and that
for repatriation of profits and dividends was increased from 3 to 6
months. By March 15, Brazil's interest arrears to international
commercial banks will be over $5 billion.
