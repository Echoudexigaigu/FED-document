The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic indicators have been quite volatile recently, but, on balance,
have been somewhat firmer than the staff had anticipated at the time of the
last Greenbook. This is especially true of the labor market data, which
strongly suggest that real GNP growth in the first quarter exceeded the
upward revised 0.9 percent annual rate estimated for the final quarter of
1989. Construction activity has been bolstered by unusually warm weather,
service sector employment has risen briskly, and auto production has
rebounded from January's depressed levels. In contrast, manufacturing
activity outside the motor vehicles industry has remained sluggish. While
average hourly earnings have risen moderately on net this year, consumer
price inflation has been surprisingly rapid, even apart from the largely
anticipated surges in food and energy prices.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor demand was strong early this year, even after accounting for
transitory weather effects and other identifiable special factors. Total
payroll employment soared 372,000 in February, following an upward revised
increase of 332,000 in January, and the unemployment rate held steady at 5.3
percent for the ninth consecutive month.
Unusually good weather in January and in the February survey week
probably accounted for a large share of the jump in construction employment,
which totaled more than 160,000 jobs for the two months. To a considerable
degree, however, this gain probably reflected an acceleration of work
planned for later months, and it is likely to be fcllowed by reduced hiring,
if not outright declines, on a seasonally adjusted basis, in coming months.

Employment in services posted a second monthly increase of nearly
150,000 in February, with gains widespread. Over the past year, services
have accounted for more than one-half of the growth in private nonfarm
payroll employment. Between February 1989 and February 1990, jobs in
services industries rose 4.8 percent, compared with 2.5 percent for private
employment overall. Growth has been particularly rapid in the large health
services category. However, gains in business services have been held down
by a decline in jobs at personnel supply agencies, a source of considerable
growth between 1983 and 1987.
Employment in the manufacturing sector was boosted in February by the
return to work of 97,000 auto workers who had been laid off in January.
Smoothing through these fluctuations, employment in the motor vehicles
industry was flat over the two-month period and has dropped nearly 50,000
over the past year. Related industries, including textiles, rubber, and
plastics, also have suffered losses. Elsewhere, small cutbacks in
manufacturing jobs continued to cumulate in February, particularly in the
electrical equipment, machinery, and lumber industries.
In the government sector, hiring of workers to conduct the decennial
Census is giving a temporary boost to employment. The BLS reports that
about 20,000 Census workers were hired in January and February; in total,
funding for 500,000 positions has been provided. Nevertheless, the maximum
number actually employed at any single time is expected to be closer to
300,000, because enumerators will be terminated as processors begin work.
As the Census winds down in the third quarter of 1990, the related bulge in
federal government employment will be reversed.

According to the household survey, total employment rose 172,000 in
February. Growth in this measure of jobs has been weak relative to the
payroll survey since mid-1989. 1 Over this period, unemployment has been
little changed. This has been associated with a decline in the number of
unemployed persons who are just entering or reentering the labor force.
That decline has offset a rise of about 300,000 in the number of job losers,
an increase consistent with the rise in insured unemployment since the
middle of last year.
A number of private firms conduct surveys of labor market conditions.
The Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising, which measures the
volume of job advertising in major newspapers, fell in January and remains
substantially below its year-ago level, suggesting that labor demand might
not be quite as strong as the payroll survey indicates. In contrast, the
survey by Manpower Inc. of the hiring plans of 15,000 large public and
private employers showed strong gains expected to continue into the first
quarter of this year, even before the weather boosted actual payrolls. This
survey, however, suggests weaker labor demand in the second quarter.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
The monthly figures on industrial activity have continued to be
bounced around by special factors. In February, total industrial production
increased 0.6 percent, retracing more than half of a sharp January decline.
Manufacturing output rose 0.7 percent, returning to its December level, with
1. Growth in multiple jobholding, which is captured in the payroll count,
may be responsible for some of the difference. But the gap also may be
attributable to an undercount of population in the household survey or
overestimates of growth of new firms in the payroll survey. Revised
population figures will become available with data from the 1990 Census.
The payroll survey will be rebenchmarked in early September to March 1989
universe counts of business employment from unemployment insurance records.

a rebound in assemblies of motor vehicles and related materials more than
accounting for the rise in output. Auto assemblies picked up to an annual
rate of 5.8 million units (FRB seasonals), from a 4.1 million unit pace in
January, and production of trucks returned to its fourth-quarter rate. By
contrast, mild weather continued to hold down the output of utilities.
Setting aside these factors, industrial production was essentially unchanged
last month, and has been flat, on balance, since last autumn.

Excluding motor vehicles and aircraft, output of final products was
down in February, as production of nondurable consumer goods and other types
of business equipment declined. While production of durable materials was
boosted by the rebound in output of parts for motor vehicles, output of
basic metals was reduced. Despite last month's decline, output of metal
materials appears to have leveled out since December after falling more than
7 percent during 1989. Production of nondurable materials decreased 0.7

percent in February; there were declines in the output of textile, paper,
and chemical materials, coupled with continued weakness in production of
energy materials.
For March, a further increase in assemblies of motor vehicles is
expected to boost industrial output'about 0.2 percent, even though
production in recent weeks has been running just a bit under schedule.
Nevertheless, other indicators of manufacturing activity suggest that
production outside of the motor vehicle industry is likely to remain about
flat. The basic trend in those orders for durable goods containing
information about near-term movements in industrial production has been
moving essentially sideways since last October.
In February, the overall capacity utilization rate for manufacturing,
mining, and utilities was 82.3 percent, about 1-3/4 percentage points below
mid-1989 levels. For advanced-processing industries, the retrenchment in
auto production has contributed importantly to the increased slack; the
slowdown in output of nonelectrical machinery also has reduced utilization.
The operating rate for primary-processing industries declined more steeply--
by around 2 percentage points--over the second half of 1989, but in February
was only a bit below its December level. Utilization at producers of
primary metals, which had fallen almost 10 percentage points last year, has
increased slightly so far this year.
Consumption and Personal Income
The underlying pace of consumer spending has been difficult to discern
because of wide swings in outlays for motor vehicles and energy-related
items. Reduced spending for cars and light trucks held down growth in
overall consumer outlays substantially in the fourth quarter, but outlays

for motor vehicles picked up in January. By contrast, spending on
electricity, natural gas, and heating oil rose 13 percent with the colder-
than-usual weather in December and then dropped 22 percent during the
unseasonably warm January. Excluding energy items and motor vehicles and
parts, real personal consumption expenditures currently are estimated by BEA
to have been flat in January after rising at an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent
in the fourth quarter of 1989 and at a 3-1/2 percent rate over the first
three quarters of the year.
The recent sluggishness in spending has been concentrated in outlays
for consumer goods. Spending on goods other than fuel oil and motor
vehicles is now shown to have edged down in January after recording little
change in the fourth quarter. According to the revised estimates of retail
sales, outlays in the retail control category, which excludes automotive
dealers and building supply stores, increased 0.7 percent in nominal terms
in February after rising 0.9 percent in January. Nonetheless, given the
recent increases in consumer prices, sales in real terms in February
probably were a bit below the fourth-quarter average. Much of the recent
weakness has been in outlays for food. In contrast, spending on durable
goods other than motor vehicles has been relatively robust. Expenditures
for services have remained strong; in real terms, spending on nonenergy
2. On March 20, the Commerce Department released its annual revisions to
retail sales and inventories for the period from January 1982 to February
1990. The revisions benchmark these series to annual retail trade surveys
and quinquennial censuses of business. The BEA will incorporate the revised
changes in retail sales in January and February in their estimates of first-
quarter GNP. The staff estimates that on a revised basis, real personal
consumption expenditures excluding motor vehicles and weather-related energy
items rose about 0.2 percent in January.

services rose 1/4 percent in January following a 4-3/4 percent annual rate
increase in the fourth quarter of 1989.
With income growing faster than spending, the personal saving rate,
which rose substantially during 1988 and early 1989, has continued to edge
up, on balance, and reached 5.9 percent in January. This behavior is
difficult to explain. Unlike the rise in 1988, the recent behavior of the
saving rate does not seem attributable to changes in household wealth:
substantial gains in stock market prices have boosted the ratio of net worth
to disposable income over the past year. One hypothesis is that
developments in markets for consumer credit have been making households
either less able or less willing to take advantage of gains in net worth to
finance current consumption. On the demand side, household finances appear
to be under somewhat greater stress, as reflected in increased delinquency
rates for some consumer loans and in a rise in personal bankruptcies. Short
of such pronounced difficulties, rising debt service payments may have
caused some consumers to decide it was time to increase saving in order to
work down their stock of debt, especially in light of the lower marginal tax
rates and loss of deductibility of interest on consumer loans. The
Michigan SRC survey indicates some reduced willingness to use savings or to
borrow to make purchases. On the supply side, losses experienced by lenders
3. While there is no high-frequency survey coverage of consumer debt
service payments, debt service estimates can be derived from data on
outstanding debt, interest rates, and loan maturities; the estimates also
require assumptions concerning prepayments and, where otherwise not
available, loan extensions. The methodology is described by Lynn Paquett in
"Estimating Household Debt Service Payments," Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, Quarterly Review (Summer 1986). These data show that the ratio of
mortgage and consumer installment debt service to disposable personal income
trended up through 1988 and 1989, reaching almost 20 percent by the end of
1989.

II-14
appear to have led to a tightening of terms on some types of installment
credit; more restrictive lending practices could increase saving by
preventing consumers from leveraging themselves as much as desired.
Another possible factor contributing to the higher personal saving rate
in 1989 is the shift in the composition of income. Some econometric models,
such as the MPS model, estimate a higher marginal propensity to save from
interest than labor income. Over the past year, personal interest income
has increased 13.5 percent, while wages and salaries have risen 7.8 percent.
Thus, some of the recent upward movement in the saving rate may reflect a
tendency of households to save more from interest than from labor income.
Autos and Light Trucks
Motor vehicle sales responded well initially to manufacturers'
incentive programs, but the effect now may be fading--in part because
current incentives are somewhat less generous than those in place at the
turn of the year. Sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks were
at a 10.6 million unit annual rate in February, down from the 12.1 million
unit rate recorded in January. At 3.1 million units, sales of foreign-made
cars and light trucks were little changed from their January pace.
Domestic auto production, although up, remained quite low in February,
running at just a 5.8 million unit annual rate. Domestic automakers have
been successful in eliminating the overhang of stocks; dealers' new-car
inventories are estimated to have fallen to 1.34 million units by the end of
last month, the lowest level since September 1985. At the February sales
pace, dealers had a sixty-one days' supply of cars on their lots.
Manufacturers appear committed to avoiding a renewed inventory buildup in
the near term. Production is scheduled to be less than 6-1/2 million units,

II-15
at an annual rate, through midyear, about 1/2 million units below the rate
of production during 1989 as a whole.

Manufacturing and Trade Inventories
The relatively prompt adjustment of output to the slowing in demand for
domestic manufactured goods has prevented, so far, any persistent backup of
factory stocks. Indeed, outside of the transportation equipment sector,
inventory changes have been relatively small since mid-1989, and the
inventory-to-shipments ratio has been essentially flat (chart, dashed line
in upper left panel).
In the transportation equipment industry, the stock-sales ratio has
risen appreciably since the middle of last year. In January, for example,
almost two-thirds of the $33 billion accumulation in manufacturing

inventories was in stocks of work-in-process reported by producers of
transportation equipment. This likely reflected the restocking of parts and
components as aircraft assembly plants returned to full production following
the Boeing strike. Inventories of finished goods fell for the fourth
straight month.
At the trade level, the pace of inventory accumulation slowed
considerably around the turn of the year, owing to widespread reductions in
December. Overall trade inventories continued to decline in January, but
the drop in auto dealers' stocks more than accounted for the reduction.
Stocks appear to be under control in most sectors, and although the
inventory-sales ratio for general merchandisers continued to move up in
January, the data now show that increase to have been less steep than
4reported earlier. Most types of non-auto retailers reported small
changes in stocks in January, and the inventory-sales ratio for this
category of stores tipped down (chart, upper right panel).
Business Fixed Investment
Capital spending appears to be retracing a fourth-quarter decrease that
largely reflected transitory developments in motor vehicles and aircraft.
Business purchases of autos and trucks probably rose sharply in January and
February in response to enhanced incentives, and shipments of aircraft to
domestic firms have resumed at Boeing.
Excluding the transportation sector, indicators of real producers'
durable equipment point to a substantial advance in the current quarter.
Outside of aircraft, shipments of nondefense capital goods, weighted by PDE

spending shares, rose 0.5 percent (not at an annual rate) in January to a
level 1 percent above their fourth-quarter average. Shipments of machinery
were strong at year-end, but fell a bit in January; however, sales of
computers appear to have revived after a lackluster fourth quarter (chart).
Orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding the aircraft group, fell
5 percent in January. Much of the January decline was attributable to a
sharp drop in bookings for communication equipment, after large runups in
November and December. However, excluding communication equipment, as well
as aircraft, orders in January stood 1 percent above the fourth-quarter
level, suggesting continued moderate growth in equipment spending outside of
transportation in the near term.
Real investment in nonresidential structures was flat last quarter, and
forward-looking indicators have remained weak. Construction put-in-place
jumped 4.5 percent in January, owing in part to unseasonably warm weather.
This increase more than reversed the December decline, pushing the January
level 1-3/4 percent (in nominal terms) above the fourth-quarter average.
Construction contracts and building permits suggest a soft picture over the
coming months (chart). Permits for office construction fell precipitously
throughout 1989, as permits and contracts for most other types of buildings
remained stagnant.
Expenditures on drilling structures rose notably in the fourth quarter.
And, although the average number of drilling rigs in use during January and
February fell to a level 1-1/4 percent below its fourth-quarter average,
footage drilled in January stood 3-1/2 percent above its fourth-quarter

level. 5 On balance, these data point to moderate growth of outlays in the
current quarter.
Housing Markets
Housing starts--at 1.48 million units--were robust for a second month
in February. The continuation of unusually warm weather contributed to a
further strengthening of single-family construction, despite a small rise in
mortgage rates. The average January-February pace of single-family
construction--l.14 million units, compared with the 1989 average of
1 million units--no doubt reflects weather-related rescheduling of
construction from future months. Other indicators of activity in this
market are less robust. In particular, permit issuance for construction of
single-family homes was unchanged through February compared with the fourth
quarter of last year, suggesting that builders have not perceived a
significant change in the demand for homes; this view matches the results of
recent surveys of homebuilders. Existing home sales also have been
essentially flat over the past several months, while new home sales declined
10 percent in January.
In the multifamily sector, starts fell 35 percent in February to an
annual rate of 331,000 units, more than offsetting the sharp jump a month
earlier, and permit issuance dropped back to a similar level. In January,
builders apparently rushed to beat proposed HUD regulations that set new
standards for most apartment projects receiving permits after January 13.
Underlying conditions in the multifamily housing market have not improved.
5. For the advance estimate of drilling and mining, BEA uses a weighted
average of footage drilled (NSA) and the Baker-Hughes rig count (SA) with
the weights set judgmentally. In recent quarters, BEA appears to be placing
more weight on footage drilled than on the rig count.

Moreover, the recent increases in mortgage interest rates may be restraining
multifamily construction activity.
Some builders continue to express concern about restrictions on the
availability of financing from savings and loan associations for land
acquisition, development, and construction (ADC loans) as a result of the
higher capital requirements and tighter loan limits mandated by FIRREA. The
constraint on home construction owing to the reduction in ADC lending by
thrift institutions probably has been relatively small to date, but it will
take some time to discern just how well other sources of credit are filling
the gap faced by homebuilders too large to fall within S&L limits and too
small to tap the open market.
The Federal Sector
The federal government recorded a budget surplus of $10 billion in
January, bringing the deficit for the first four months of the current
fiscal year to $60 billion, compared with $65 billion a year earlier.
Personal income tax payments have remained the primary source of receipts
growth, accounting for $14 billion of the $17 billion increase in receipts.
Corporate income tax payments so far this fiscal year have been lower than a
year ago, reflecting the falloff in corporate profits.
Outlays in the first four months of FY1990 were 3-1/4 percent, or
$12 billion, higher than a year earlier. Growth in outlays was reduced, in
part, by the $3 billion shift in military pay from the beginning of FY1990
to the end of FY1989. Also, agriculture spending has been well below the
year-ago pace, owing to a sharp decline in drought-related disaster payments
and the shift from FY1990 to FY1989 of about $1 billion in farm payments.

II-26
In addition, $9.5 billion in REFCORP borrowing was recorded as an offsetting
receipt (negative outlay) in the unified budget.
The major sources of outlay growth were social security and Medicare
outlays and net interest payments. In addition, spending in the education,
science, health, and justice functions (areas that the President has
identified as domestic priorities) was more than 10 percent above a year
earlier. Expenditures for disaster relief, foreign military sales
financing, federal employee retirement, and low-income support programs also
rose rapidly.

from $138 billion to $158 billion. The higher figure mainly reflects a
reassessment of RTC working capital needs, in light of the Administration's
decision to fund RTC working capital by borrowing from the Federal Financing
Bank (FFB), a part of the Department of the Treasury. Funds borrowed from
the FFB are scored as an outlay in the unified budget as the borrowing
agency spends the loan proceeds, while repayment is scored as an offsetting
receipt (a negative outlay). CBO now estimates that the RTC net borrowing
for working capital will be $24 billion in FY1990. The Administration
estimated in its budget document that RTC net borrowing will be in the $39
billion to $62 billion range, but did not include any provision for RTC
working capital in its FY1990 and FY1991 deficit projections.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
increased at a 5.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year,
the largest quarterly advance in 3-1/2 years. Essentially all of the recent
strength was in construction expenditures, which jumped more than 25 percent
at an annual rate. Among the categories of construction, by far the largest
increase at the end of the year was in highways, as construction apparently
continued in the West, particularly in the San Francisco area where
rebuilding efforts late in the year followed the October earthquake; the
December cold weather was concentrated in the eastern and central regions of
the country. In January, real construction spending fell back sharply, with
the largest drop for highways.

Most state legislatures currently are in session, and many are
reporting deteriorating budgetary pictures. Fiscal erosion has been most
severe in the Northeast, but difficulties abound in much of the Mid-Atlantic
and Southeast. Generally, states in the West and the middle of the nation
are in fairly good condition (map). Eight states are expecting to show
deficits for FY1990, which ends June 30 for most, and many more are
experiencing revenue shortfalls as economic activity has been weaker than
expected at the time budgets were planned last spring. Indeed, unemployment
rates in most of the Northeast states rose last year. Tax increases are
being considered; New Hampshire, for example, recently raised several types
of excise taxes. In addition, 18 states have announced plans to cut
spending below budgeted levels. Meeting Medicaid, corrections, and
education spending goals, all top priorities, likely will be more difficult
than in recent years. Infrastructure spending is even more problematic
because it often can be postponed.
Prices
Inflation picked up somewhat early this year, even apart from weather-
related increases in the food and energy sectors. The consumer price index
rose 1.1 percent in January and 0.5 percent in February; the increases were
0.6 and 0.5 percent respectively, if food and energy items are excluded.
Meanwhile, producer prices of finished goods were unchanged in February,
after surging 1.8 percent in January.
Retail energy prices climbed 5 percent in January but turned down in
February. Prices of fuel oil in February reversed more than half of the big
January runup, as inventories were replenished when demand eased with warmer
weather. In contrast, gasoline stocks remained low through the end of

January, after the freeze-related refinery disruptions; retail gasoline
prices were up somewhat further in February following their January increase
of 8 percent. Gasoline stocks have since recovered, and spot prices have
moved down, suggesting some reversal at the retail level in the next few
months.
The CPI for food jumped 2 percent in January, but slowed considerably
in February, to a rise of 1/2 percent, and the recent farm price data point
to an easing of food price increases in the spring. In wholesale markets,
fresh vegetable prices turned down in the second half of February and had
fallen considerably by mid-March, though not back to pre-freeze levels.
Similarly, the farm price of milk, which had climbed in the second half of
1989, fell steeply in February, as did the producer prices of dairy
products. The spot and futures prices of other livestock products, while
mixed of late, do not seem to indicate sustained upward pressures at
anything close to the pace of early 1990. For most other foods, big price
increases in January were followed in February by either moderate increases
or small declines. A little acceleration was evident, however, in the index
for food away from home; prices in this relatively low-wage sector could be
boosted further in the spring by the rise in the minimum wage.
Excluding food and energy items, increases in consumer prices in
January and February were widespread. The index for lodging while out of
town was up by more than 2-1/2 percent in both months, as rates were raised
by more than usual in winter resort areas. Air fares also rose
substantially in January and February. The January CPI was boosted by hikes
in prices of services provided by the government sector, including a 4.3
percent increase in auto registration fees and a 3.9 percent rise in charges

for intracity public transportation. In February, apparel prices added
about 0.2 percent to the CPI, as spring clothing was introduced into the
sample earlier than usual.
At the producer level, prices of capital equipment rose about
1/4 percent in January and February, slightly below the average pace of the
previous 12 months; prices were held down in part by discounting for cars
and light trucks over this period. The PPI for intermediate materials less
food and energy edged up slightly in both January and February. Prices of
crude nonfood materials less energy rose 0.2 percent in January, but then
fell 3/4 percent in February.
Since the February pricing week, measures of spot prices on domestic
markets, based mainly on industrial materials, have turned up, retracing a
fraction of the slide from their 1989 peaks. The Journal of Commerce
index (upper panel of chart) has risen about 2 percent since mid-February;
the sub-index for metals has moved up more sharply over the period--
7-1/2 percent--reaching the levels of late autumn. In large part, the
pickup has reflected increases for nonferrous metals that began around mid-
February and gained substantial upward force by the third week of March.
Over this period, price increases amounted to more than 10 percent for
aluminum and 20 percent or more for copper, lead, and zinc. The reason for
such sudden and sizable increases is not altogether clear at the moment.
While these prices often are heavily influenced by trends in aggregate
demand, the current price upswing started so recently that data on activity
for the same period are quite sparse. Special factors, such as strikes and
other supply disruptions, are reported to be influencing prices of some of
the metals, but it does not seem likely that special factors could have

affected virtually all of the nonferrous metals simultaneously. Still
another explanation that has appeared in the recent press reports is that
the rise in commodity prices is reflecting strong activity abroad. Which,
if any, of these various interpretations is correct presumably will become
more clear as additional data become available over the next few weeks.
Labor Costs
Little additional information on labor costs has become available since
the last Greenbook. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory
workers fluctuated considerably in January and February, owing to shifts in
employment among manufacturing and construction workers. The February
reading was 3-3/4 percent above a year earlier, at the low end of the range
of 12-month changes observed since late 1988.
Revised data still show productivity in the nonfarm business sector to
have been essentially flat in the fourth quarter of 1989, and up only 0.6
percent over the four quarters of 1989, well below the recent trend. With
hourly compensation estimated to have risen 5-1/2 percent last year, unit
labor costs accelerated, rising 4-3/4 percent compared with 3 percent the
year before.
Productivity in the manufacturing sector is estimated to have risen
2-3/4 percent at an annual rate last quarter, well above the rate for the
nonfarm business sector, but below increases posted in this sector earlier
in the year. Compensation per hour in the manufacturing sector increased
4-3/4 percent over the four quarters of last year, and unit labor costs grew
around 2 percent, somewhat faster than a year earlier.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most short-term interest rates have risen slightly since the February
FOMC meeting. Statements by System officials, against a backdrop of
stronger than expected economic data, have largely eliminated the
anticipation of any near-term easing of monetary policy. Treasury bond
yields have moved down a bit from levels at the time of the mid-quarter
financing, while other long-term rates are little changed. Increases in
major stock price indexes of 2 to 4 percent in the intermeeting period
likely reflect wider acceptance of the view that the risks of recession are
low.
The monetary aggregates accelerated significantly in February after
growing relatively slowly in January. Ml grew at a 10 percent pace, as
demand deposits resumed their growth and currency continued to expand
briskly. Growth of M2 was concentrated in its more liquid components--Ml as
well as money market funds, savings deposits, and MMDAs. M3 growth was a
more moderate 6 percent, owing mainly to the continued'shrinkage of managed
liabilities of thrift institutions. Data for early March indicate that
growth of the monetary aggregates has slowed somewhat from February's pace.
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses appeared to weaken further in
February, as bank lending, public bond offerings, and issuance of commercial
paper, especially for restructuring purposes, were all anemic. The
bankruptcy filing of Drexel Burnham Lambert on February 13 and the
announcement by Columbia Savings on March 14 that it was seeking a buyer for
its large junk-bond portfolio contributed to another 60 basis point widening
of yield spreads on junk bonds over Treasuries since the last FOMC meeting.

Federal debt issuance in the first quarter has been augmented by borrowing
to provide working capital to the RTC. State and local bond offerings
continued very weak in February. Limited information suggests that
household debt may be continuing to grow at about the same, more moderate,
rate as in the fourth quarter.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
After recording no change in January, M1 expanded at a 10 percent
annual rate in February, as demand deposits and, to a lesser extent, other
checkable deposits accelerated. Currency growth slowed somewhat from its
very rapid January pace, but remained at a double-digit rate, evidently
buoyed by unusually large demands for U.S. currency in Latin America and
Eastern Europe. So far in March, Ml appears to be growing more slowly than
in February.
M2 grew almost as fast as Ml in February, owing to a pickup in its
nontransactions components. Strength was especially marked in liquid
accounts, despite some widening of spreads between rates on these accounts
and on Treasury bills. Tax refunds to individuals have been relatively
strong so far this year and may have contributed a little to growth in MMDAs
and MMMFs. Expansion of small time deposits, on the other hand, moderated
somewhat last month as rates on such deposits lagged increases in market
rates; the greater attractiveness of Treasury issues was evidenced by a
sharp rise in noncompetitive tenders. Banks, fairly flush with funds,
appear to be sluggish in raising their deposit rates to meet the increase in
Treasury rates. Perhaps reflecting this widening yield spread, data for
early March suggest some slowing of M2 growth this month.

Growth of M3 picked up in February, but less so than was the case with
the narrower aggregates, as banks joined thrifts in running off large time
deposits. Although savings and loans remain under pressure to pare their
balance sheets to improve capital ratios, SAIF-insured institutions not in
RTC conservatorship ran off managed liabilities at a slower pace in January
and February than in the last quarter of 1989. At S&Ls in conservatorship,
however, the pace of the run-off of managed liabilities increased
significantly. At banks, healthy growth in core deposits in February
moderated the need to rely on managed liabilities to fund a pickup in credit
extended. With continued weakness in its non-M2 component, M3 growth also
appears to be moderating in March.
Bank credit strengthened in February to an 8-1/2 percent annual rate of
growth. Banks continued to acquire U.S. government securities at a rapid
pace, with data for large banks suggesting that, on a month-average basis,
the February growth was about evenly split between Treasury issues and
mortgage-backed securities. Over the whole period since the implementation
of FIRREA last August, about two-thirds of the growth in U.S. government
securities held at large banks have taken the form of mortgage-backed
securities.
After below-trend growth in January, real estate loans returned to a 12
percent annual rate of growth last month. Preliminary call report data for
December show that the major contributors to real estate loan growth in the
fourth quarter of 1989 were mortgages on single-family homes and nonfarm
nonresidential properties, while construction and land development loans
weakened, likely reflecting greater caution in extending such credit.
Consumer loan growth, at a 3-1/2 percent rate in February, was depressed by

about 6 percentage points owing to securitization. After adjusting for
securitization, the growth of consumer loans picked up a bit over the pace
of the last three months.
Business loans contracted last month, continuing the decline begun late
last year. The decline can be traced, in part, to the virtual cessation of
net extensions of credit in connection with major corporate restructurings.
Such transactions kept business loans from declining for 1989 as a whole.
The decline in non-merger loans also was faster in February than on average
in 1989.
Preliminary fourth-quarter data from bank call reports indicate a
continuing deterioration in asset quality. Even though chargeoffs net of
recoveries increased, which, other things equal, would lower delinquencies,
delinquencies also increased for major loan categories (see chart). On a
consolidated basis, banks charged off C&I loans (largely to foreign
borrowers) at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3 percent; still, the
share of delinquent C&I loans remaining on banks' books edged up to 4.9
percent, seasonally adjusted. The rate at which real estate loans were
charged off moved up, largely reflecting developments in the Boston and
Dallas Federal Reserve districts; nevertheless, the share of delinquent real
estate loans rose to 5.5 percent, mainly reflecting a deterioration at banks
in the Boston and New York districts. For both C&I and real estate loans,
delinquency rates remained well below the peaks seen just after the 1982
recession, but chargeoff rates were near the highest levels recorded since
these data were first collected in 1982. Finally, chargeoff rates of
consumer loans continued to rise in the fourth quarter, and delinquencies
rose slightly.

Business Finance
Total borrowing by nonfinancial firms appears to have weakened further
in February, reflecting in part the reluctance of investors to fund
restructuring activity. In addition, available evidence suggests non-
merger-related borrowing slackened. After posting strong growth in January,
the outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial firms was about unchanged
in February, and bank loans declined, so that total short-term borrowing
dropped off significantly. Public bond issuance by nonfinancial
corporations remained weak in February and early March.
The immediate impact on the corporate bond market of Drexel's
bankruptcy filing on February 13 was quite mild. Merger and restructuring
activity, which in the past three years had accounted for about 80 percent
of all new junk issuance, already had slowed considerably owing to
difficulties in funding new deals, as investors demanded much higher yields
or refused to lend altogether. The effect on the secondary market was also
cushioned somewhat because Drexel had already withdrawn as a marketmaker
over the preceding months.
A more noticeable impact of Drexel's bankruptcy was on the issuance of
commercial paper by nonfinancial corporations. Drexel's disappearance left
some low-rated and unrated companies without a dealer to issue their paper.
Because other dealers have been very cautious in picking up Drexel's junk
commercial paper business, nonfinancial paper outstanding, unchanged in
February, was approximately $1 to $1-1/2 billion less than it otherwise
would have been; outstanding paper of nonfinancial corporations had been
growing around $3 billion monthly in the preceding three months.

III-10
The potential for sizable sales of junk bonds by large institutional
investors has led to wider spreads between junk bonds and other issues. The
most recently available data indicate that outflows from high-yield mutual
funds were large in January, and at the same time, mutual funds built up
their cash positions as protection against further redemptions. Outflows
reportedly moderated somewhat in February, however, with no indication that
they have picked up in response to publicity about Drexel's problems.
Thrifts are reported to have sold significant amounts of junk bonds over the
past few months, likely reflecting requirements that they mark their
holdings of junk bonds to market and divest direct holdings by 1994. On
March 14, Columbia Savings announced it was seeking a buyer for its nearly
$4 billion portfolio of junk bonds. At the same time, however, the RTC
announced that it would not dump its holdings of junk bonds on the market.
No significant sales of junk bonds by life insurance companies have been
reported thus far, but market participants have expressed concern that the
recent downgrading in the claims-paying ability of Executive Life--a large
holder of junk bonds--could make it difficult for that company, and perhaps
some others, to roll over the amounts of guaranteed investment contracts
necessary to support its portfolio.
Drexel's failure is the most dramatic indication to date of the
stresses that brokerage firms are experiencing. Sluggish retail business
and a drop-off in fees associated with debt-financed mergers are among the
problems facing many brokerage houses. In addition, a number of houses have
large bridge loans outstanding that they are finding hard to refinance in
the troubled junk bond market. Such problems led to the downgrading of
Merrill Lynch's senior and subordinated debt and commercial paper, and some

III-11
investors have curtailed their lending to other securities firms. Some
firms with deep-pocketed owners have had to dig into those pockets to
reassure creditors. Shearson Lehman Hutton had to withdraw a planned stock
offering and has been the recipient of a $250 million capital infusion from
its parent, American Express, which also announced plans to inject a further
$750 million and to buy back the remaining publicly held Shearson stock.
First Boston, under pressure from credit-rating concerns, sold to its
parent, CS Holding, more than half of a $450 million troubled bridge loan to
Ohio Mattress.
Despite the turmoil in the junk bond market and associated negative
implications for merger and acquisition activity--and despite the plunge in
share prices in Tokyo--most major U.S. stock indexes have risen between 2
and 4 percent since the last FOMC meeting. Gross equity offerings by
nonfinancial firms have remained substantial with the $2 billion issuance in
February representing the highest level since July 1988. At this point, it
appears that net equity retirements in the first half of the year will fall
below the fourth quarter's already reduced pace.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that the federal government will run a $68
billion deficit (not seasonally adjusted) in the first quarter, close to
that in the fourth quarter. The deficit is expected to be financed by about
$51 billion in marketable borrowing, including a $10 billion cash management
bill already issued, and by a moderate draw on the Treasury's cash balance.
Relative to projections in the last Greenbook, first-quarter Treasury
borrowing was boosted by the decision of the RTC Oversight Board to fund the
working capital needs of the RTC through the Federal Financing Bank. In

line with the move, the Treasury announced at the end of February that it
would increase the size of the weekly bill auctions from $15.2 billion to
$16.0 billion through the end of March. The cost to the RTC of working
capital will be 1/8 percent over the 90-day Treasury bill rate. As of mid-
March, however, the RTC had not yet drawn on the working capital of $11
billion earmarked for it by the Treasury. If the RTC does not use the
earmarked funds, Treasury cash balances will be at unusually high levels in
April.
In January, FHLB debt outstanding declined for the eighth consecutive
month, and a decline in FHLB advances to member thrifts in February may
point to a continuation of the string of declines in FHLB debt outstanding.
FNMA, which in 1989 had been borrowing heavily to acquire mortgages for its
portfolio, paid down almost $1 billion of debt in January. This one-month
drop apparently owed partly to a narrowing of spreads on mortgage
instruments over FMNA's cost of funds and a consequent slowing of its
portfolio acquisitions. Spreads on agency debt over Treasuries have
remained fairly stable in recent weeks.
Several items were included in the Administration's budget, released at
the end of January, that could affect the market for agency securities.
User fees were once again proposed on new securities issued by Freddie Mac,
Fannie Mae, and Sallie Mae. For debt instruments, the proposed fee paid by
these agencies would begin at 10 basis points in the first year, FY 1991,
and increase to 20 basis points in FY 1992 and 30 basis points in FY 1993.
For mortgage-backed securities, the fees would run 5, 10, and 15 basis
points, respectively. User fees on GSE debt have been proposed a number of
times in recent years, and hence the current proposal, based on the

III-14
rationale that these agencies should reimburse the federal government for
the borrowing advantages they enjoy as a result of their special
relationship with the government, did not generate much comment. Elsewhere
in the budget document, there was an unusually explicit acknowledgement of
the widespread belief that government assistance would be provided if these
agencies were unable to support their debt. This acknowledgement, however,
did not have any noticeable impact in the market.
Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term municipal securities continued sluggish in
February and the first half of March. Refunding volume has been noticeably
weak thus far in 1990, as the backup in yields since the first of the year
has contributed to a reduction in issuance to about one-fifth of its 1989
pace. New capital issuance also has fallen below last year's monthly
average. Largely reflecting a single offering by Puerto Rico, short-term
offerings picked up in February; they should strengthen further in coming

with large issues to cover budget shortfalls.
The stricter limitations contained in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on
bonds issued for private activity purposes and issued by tax-exempt entities
other than hospitals are reportedly beginning to constrain the issuance of
tax-exempt debt. For example, the $150 million cap on outstanding debt
issued by individual non-profit institutions now precludes twenty-four
universities from issuing additional tax-exempt debt. In addition, several
states, including California, have reached their $50 per capita limit on
outstanding private activity debt.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage debt growth appears to have been maintained into the new year
at about the fourth-quarter pace of 7-1/4 percent, despite continued
shedding of mortgage assets by the thrift industry. Mortgage-related
lending by banks continued robust through February, with the strength
evidently still concentrated in single-family mortgages, home equity lines,
and mortgage-backed securities. Thrift institutions, on the other hand,
have continued to disinvest mortgage assets held either as whole loans or as
mortgage pass-through securities, but at a considerably more moderate pace
than the 20 percent annual rate of decline recorded in December at SAIF-
insured institutions. On balance, however, there does not appear to be any
shortfall in credit availability, especially for residential mortgage
credit: There has been no significant widening in yield spreads of either
fixed or adjustable-rate mortgages over Treasuries of comparable maturities.
Pricing of mortgages and mortgage securities has been adjusting to the
market's gradual recognition that prepayments on fixed-rate mortgages have

slowed during the past three years by more than would be expected given
changes in market interest rates. Lower inflation in housing prices
resulting in reduced economic incentives for homeowners to move, as well as
a shift to ARMs by relatively mobile households, appear to have contributed
to the slowdown in prepayments on fixed-rate mortgages. Responding in part
to the increased popularity of ARMs with more mobile households, FNMA is
promoting fixed-rate products targeted on homebuyers who want the security
of fixed-rate financing but who expect to move within a few years of the
purchase of a home. These loans carry a fixed interest rate for the first
seven years and amortize according to a thirty-year schedule. At the end of
seven years, the borrower can extend the loan for another 23 years, using
then-current interest rates. The main attraction to borrowers is the loan's
lower interest rate compared to standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.
Since the previous FOMC meeting, contract rates on fixed-rate mortgages
rose 17 basis points to 10.34 percent. In response to higher market rates
since late last year, the Department of Veteran Affairs in February raised
the ceiling rate on loans it guarantees to 10 percent. 1 In the market for
adjustable-rate mortgages, initial rate discounting has continued to
moderate. Only 55 percent of the ARMs originated in early January carried
1. The VA ceiling rate tends to serve also as the market standard contract
rate for home loans insured by the FHA. Based on a survey of lenders, the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that about 12
percent of all mortgage-loan originations (measured in dollars) on 1-4
family homes in the last half of 1989 were insured by FHA or VA. The
National Association of Realtors estimates that fully 35 percent of
originations for home purchase (measured in number of loans) were insured by
FHA or VA, based on a survey of its members. Because FHA/VA loans are
significantly smaller on average than conventional loans, these two
estimates are not necessarily inconsistent.

any initial-period discount below the scheduled contract rate, and about
half of the discounts were for less than 2 percentage points.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at a 6 percent annual rate
in January, equal to the average pace for all of last year, and a little
slower than in December. After increasing faster than consumption spending
over the first three years of the current economic expansion, consumer
credit growth has roughly matched the spending pace since 1986,
2notwithstanding some divergence in quarter-to-quarter movements.
January's increase in consumer credit was held down by a 2 percent
annual rate of increase in revolving credit; in December, that component had
surged at a 24 percent rate. Revolving credit frequently moves erratically
in December and January because the proportions of Christmas season
transactions entering lenders' books in each of these months can vary
substantially from year to year, complicating seasonal adjustment. Looking
through the near-term volatility, revolving credit appears to have slowed
somewhat recently: From the end of the third quarter through January, it
grew at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate, compared with 15-1/2 percent over the
first nine months of 1989.
While revolving credit was slowing, the growth of automobile credit
picked up in January to nearly an 8 percent annual rate from 2 percent in
both the fourth quarter and 1989 as a whole. A rebound in new-car sales in
2. A pattern of initial growth more rapid than consumption and subsequent
parity of growth rates is typical of consumer credit over an extended
upward movement in a business cycle. This pattern owes partly to the
behavior of debt repayments, which grow relatively slowly early in an
expansion (reflecting reduced credit extensions in the previous recession),
then pick up later in the cycle, providing more of an offset to new
borrowing.

III-20
January, stimulated by expanded offerings of price rebates and low-rate
loans, spurred the faster auto credit growth. Reflecting the below-market
rates on some transactions, the average finance rate on new-car loans at the
auto finance companies declined 5/8 percentage point in January to
12-5/8 percent.

1. Weighted average of separate categories, excluding credit cards.
Measures of household debt repayment problems, which generally had
worsened in the third quarter of 1989, improved somewhat during the fourth
quarter. Auto loan delinquencies at the auto finance companies edged down
after several quarters of steady increases. Delinquencies on bank credit
cards fell fairly sharply in the fourth quarter to a relatively low level,
according to the American Bankers Association (ABA). The ABA's average
delinquency rate on a variety of closed-end consumer loans at commercial
banks also declined moderately in the fourth quarter, following a sharp jump
in the previous quarter. As indicated in the section on bank credit,
3. The third-quarter climb had raised the rate from the middle of its
historical range to its upper bound, but had appeared suspect because none
of the component loan types experienced increases as big as the overall
increase. In the fourth quarter, delinquencies rose for some components and
fell for others, but seemed consistent with a decline on average.

III-21
above, call report data for large banks showed a small increase in consumer
loan delinquencies in the fourth quarter. The quarterly movements of the
call report series have deviated from the pattern of the ABA series, but
both were up moderately over 1989.
Delinquencies on home mortgages generally have shown less evidence of
repayment problems in recent months than the consumer loan series. The
proportion of mortgages 60 or more days past due, reported by the Mortgage
Bankers Association (MBA), declined slightly in the fourth quarter, leaving
the delinquency rate at about the level prevailing at the beginning of 1989,
which was the lowest in eight years.
In contrast to the general improvement in delinquency experience in the
fourth quarter of last year, personal bankruptcy filings rose rather
sharply, reversing a small decline in the previous quarter. For the full
year, personal bankruptcies rose 12 percent, about in line with the
increases of the previous two years, but well below the 20-to-30 percent
increases of 1985 and 1986. It is difficult to interpret the upward trend
in bankruptcies in the past few years because changes in bankruptcy law have
made it a more attractive remedy to borrowers for debt payment problems.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most short-term interest rates have risen slightly since the February
FOMC meeting. Statements by System officials, against a backdrop of
stronger than expected economic data, have largely eliminated the
anticipation of any near-term easing of monetary policy. Treasury bond
yields have moved down a bit from levels at the time of the mid-quarter
financing, while other long-term rates are little changed. Increases in
major stock price indexes of 2 to 4 percent in the intermeeting period
likely reflect wider acceptance of the view that the risks of recession are
low.
The monetary aggregates accelerated significantly in February after
growing relatively slowly in January. Ml grew at a 10 percent pace, as
d mand deposits resumed their growth and currency continued to expand
briskly. Growth of M2 was concentrated in its more liquid components--Ml as
well as money market funds, savings deposits, and MMDAs. M3 growth was a
more moderate 6 percent, owing mainly to the continued shrinkage of managed
liabilities of thrift institutions. Data for early March indicate that
growth of the monetary aggregates has slowed somewhat from February's pace.
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses appeared to weaken further in
February, as bank lending, public bond offerings, and issuance of commercial
paper, especially for restructuring purposes, were all anemic. The
bankruptcy filing of Drexel Burnham Lambert on February 13 and the
announcement by Columbia Savings on March 14 that it was seeking a buyer for
its large junk-bond portfolio contributed to another 60 basis point widening
of yield spreads on junk bonds over Treasuries since the last FOMC meeting.

Federal debt issuance in the first quarter has been augmented by borrowing
to provide working capital to the RTC. State and local bond offerings
continued very weak in February. Limited information suggests that
household debt may be continuing to grow at about the same, more moderate,
rate as in the fourth quarter.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
After recording no change in January, M1 expanded at a 10 percent
annual rate in February, as demand deposits and, to a lesser extent, other
checkable deposits accelerated. Currency growth slowed somewhat from its
very rapid January pace, but remained at a double-digit rate, evidently
buoyed by unusually large demands for U.S. currency in Latin America and
Eastern Europe. So far in March, Ml appears to be growing more slowly than
in February.
M2 grew almost as fast as Ml in February, owing to a pickup in its
nontransactions components. Strength was especially marked in liquid
accounts, despite some widening of spreads between rates on these accounts
and on Treasury bills. Tax refunds to individuals have been relatively
strong so far this year and may have contributed a little to growth in MMDAs
and MMMFs. Expansion of small time deposits, on the other hand, moderated
somewhat last month as rates on such deposits lagged increases in market
rates; the greater attractiveness of Treasury issues was evidenced by a
sharp rise in noncompetitive tenders. Banks, fairly flush with funds,
appear to be sluggish in raising their deposit rates to meet the increase in
Treasury rates. Perhaps reflecting this widening yield spread, data for
early March suggest some slowing of M2 growth this month.

Growth of M3 picked up in February, but less so than was the case with
the narrower aggregates, as banks joined thrifts in running off large time
deposits. Although savings and loans remain under pressure to pare their
balance sheets to improve capital ratios, SAIF-insured institutions not in
RTC conservatorship ran off managed liabilities at a slower pace in January
and February than in the last quarter of 1989. At S&Ls in conservatorship,
however, the pace of the run-off of managed liabilities increased
significantly. At banks, healthy growth in core deposits in February
moderated the need to rely on managed liabilities to fund a pickup in credit
extended. With continued weakness in its non-M2 component, M3 growth also
appears to be moderating in March.
Bank credit strengthened in February to an 8-1/2 percent annual rate of
growth. Banks continued to acquire U.S. government securities at a rapid
pace, with data for large banks suggesting that, on a month-average basis,
the February growth was about evenly split between Treasury issues and
mortgage-backed securities. Over the whole period since the implementation
of FIRREA last August, about two-thirds of the growth in U.S. government
securities held at large banks have taken the form of mortgage-backed
securities.
After below-trend growth in January, real estate loans returned to a 12
percent annual rate of growth last month. Preliminary call report data for
December show that the major contributors to real estate loan growth in the
fourth quarter of 1989 were mortgages on single-family homes and nonfarm
nonresidential properties, while construction and land development loans
weakened, likely reflecting greater caution in extending such credit.
Consumer loan growth, at a 3-1/2 percent rate in February, was depressed by

about 6 percentage points owing to securitization. After adjusting for
securitization, the growth of consumer loans picked up a bit over the pace
of the last three months.
Business loans contracted last month, continuing the decline begun late
last year. The decline can be traced, in part, to the virtual cessation of
net extensions of credit in connection with major corporate restructurings.
Such transactions kept business loans from declining for 1989 as a whole.
The decline in non-merger loans also was faster in February than on average
in 1989.
Preliminary fourth-quarter data from bank call reports indicate a
continuing deterioration in asset quality. Even though chargeoffs net of
recoveries increased, which, other things equal, would lower delinquencies,
delinquencies also increased for major loan categories (see chart). On a
consolidated basis, banks charged off C&I loans (largely to foreign
borrowers) at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3 percent; still, the
share of delinquent C&I loans remaining on banks' books edged up to 4.9
percent, seasonally adjusted. The rate at which real estate loans were
charged off moved up, largely reflecting developments in the Boston and
Dallas Federal Reserve districts; nevertheless, the share of delinquent real
estate loans rose to 5.5 percent, mainly reflecting a deterioration at banks
in the Boston and New York districts. For both C&I and real estate loans,
delinquency rates remained well below the peaks seen just after the 1982
recession, but chargeoff rates were near the highest levels recorded since
these data were first collected in 1982. Finally, chargeoff rates of
consumer loans continued to rise in the fourth quarter, and delinquencies
rose slightly.

Business Finance
Total borrowing by nonfinancial firms appears to have weakened further
in February, reflecting in part the reluctance of investors to fund
restructuring activity. In addition, available evidence suggests non-
merger-related borrowing slackened. After posting strong growth in January,
the outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial firms was about unchanged
in February, and bank loans declined, so that total short-term borrowing
dropped off significantly. Public bond issuance by nonfinancial
corporations remained weak in February and early March.
The immediate impact on the corporate bond market of Drexel's
bankruptcy filing on February 13 was quite mild. Merger and restructuring
activity, which in the past three years had accounted for about 80 percent
of all new junk issuance, already had slowed considerably owing to
difficulties in funding new deals, as investors demanded much higher yields
or refused to lend altogether. The effect on the secondary market was also
cushioned somewhat because Drexel had already withdrawn as a marketmaker
over the preceding months.
A more noticeable impact of Drexel's bankruptcy was on the issuance of
commercial paper by nonfinancial corporations. Drexel's disappearance left
some low-rated and unrated companies without a dealer to issue their paper.
Because other dealers have been very cautious in picking up Drexel's junk
commercial paper business, nonfinancial paper outstanding, unchanged in
February, was approximately $1 to $1-1/2 billion less than it otherwise
would have been; outstanding paper of nonfinancial corporations had been
growing around $3 billion monthly in the preceding three months.

III-10
The potential for sizable sales of junk bonds by large institutional
investors has led to wider spreads between junk bonds and other issues. The
most recently available data indicate that outflows from high-yield mutual
funds were large in January, and at the same time, mutual funds built up
their cash positions as protection against further redemptions. Outflows
reportedly moderated somewhat in February, however, with no indication that
they have picked up in response to publicity about Drexel's problems.
Thrifts are reported to have sold significant amounts of junk bonds over the
past few months, likely reflecting requirements that they mark their
holdings of junk bonds to market and divest direct holdings by 1994. On
March 14, Columbia Savings announced it was seeking a buyer for its nearly
$4 billion portfolio of junk bonds. At the same time, however, the RTC
announced that it would not dump its holdings of junk bonds on the market.
No significant sales of junk bonds by life insurance companies have been
reported thus far, but market participants have expressed concern that the
recent downgrading in the claims-paying ability of Executive Life--a large
holder of junk bonds--could make it difficult for that company, and perhaps
some others, to roll over the amounts of guaranteed investment contracts
necessary to support its portfolio.
Drexel's failure is the most dramatic indication to date of the
stresses that brokerage firms are experiencing. Sluggish retail business
and a drop-off in fees associated with debt-financed mergers are among the
problems facing many brokerage houses. In addition, a number of houses have
large bridge loans outstanding that they are finding hard to refinance in
the troubled junk bond market. Such problems led to the downgrading of
Merrill Lynch's senior and subordinated debt and commercial paper, and some

III-11
investors have curtailed their lending to other securities firms. Some
firms with deep-pocketed owners have had to dig into those pockets to
reassure creditors. Shearson Lehman Hutton had to withdraw a planned stock
offering and has been the recipient of a $250 million capital infusion from
its parent, American Express, which also announced plans to inject a further
$750 million and to buy back the remaining publicly held Shearson stock.
First Boston, under pressure from credit-rating concerns, sold to its
parent, CS Holding, more than half of a $450 million troubled bridge loan to
Ohio Mattress.
Despite the turmoil in the junk bond market and associated negative
implications for merger and acquisition activity--and despite the plunge in
share prices in Tokyo--most major U.S. stock indexes have risen between 2
and 4 percent since the last FOMC meeting. Gross equity offerings by
nonfinancial firms have remained substantial with the $2 billion issuance in
February representing the highest level since July 1988. At this point, it
appears that net equity retirements in the first half of the year will fall
below the fourth quarter's already reduced pace.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that the federal government will run a $68
billion deficit (not seasonally adjusted) in the first quarter, close to
that in the fourth quarter. The deficit is expected to be financed by about
$51 billion in marketable borrowing, including a $10 billion cash management
bill already issued, and by a moderate draw on the Treasury's cash balance.
Relative to projections in the last Greenbook, first-quarter Treasury
borrowing was boosted by the decision of the RTC Oversight Board to fund the
working capital needs of the RTC through the Federal Financing Bank. In

line with the move, the Treasury announced at the end of February that it
would increase the size of the weekly bill auctions from $15.2 billion to
$16.0 billion through the end of March. The cost to the RTC of working
capital will be 1/8 percent over the 90-day Treasury bill rate. As of mid-
March, however, the RTC had not yet drawn on the working capital of $11
billion earmarked for it by the Treasury. If the RTC does not use the
earmarked funds, Treasury cash balances will be at unusually high levels in
April.
In January, FHLB debt outstanding declined for the eighth consecutive
month, and a decline in FHLB advances to member thrifts in February may
point to a continuation of the string of declines in FHLB debt outstanding.
FNMA, which in 1989 had been borrowing heavily to acquire mortgages for its
portfolio, paid down almost $1 billion of debt in January. This one-month
drop apparently owed partly to a narrowing of spreads on mortgage
instruments over FNMA's cost of funds and a consequent slowing of its
portfolio acquisitions. Spreads on agency debt over Treasuries have
remained fairly stable in recent weeks.
Several items were included in the Administration's budget, released at
the end of January, that could affect the market for agency securities.
User fees were once again proposed on new securities issued by Freddie Mac,
Fannie Mae, and Sallie Mae. For debt instruments, the proposed fee paid by
these agencies would begin at 10 basis points in the first year, FY 1991,
and increase to 20 basis points in FY 1992 and 30 basis points in FY 1993.
For mortgage-backed securities, the fees would run 5, 10, and 15 basis
points, respectively. User fees on GSE debt have been proposed a number of
times in recent years, and hence the current proposal, based on the

III-14
rationale that these agencies should reimburse the federal government for
the borrowing advantages they enjoy as a result of their special
relationship with the government, did not generate much comment. Elsewhere
in the budget document, there was an unusually explicit acknowledgement of
the widespread belief that government assistance would be provided if these
agencies were unable to support their debt. This acknowledgement, however,
did not have any noticeable impact in the market.
Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term municipal securities continued sluggish in
February and the first half of March. Refunding volume has been noticeably
weak thus far in 1990, as the backup in yields since the first of the year
has contributed to a reduction in issuance to about one-fifth of its 1989
pace. New capital issuance also has fallen below last year's monthly
average. Largely reflecting a single offering by Puerto Rico, short-term
offerings picked up in February; they should strengthen further in coming

weeks as New York State and Massachusetts are expected to come to market
with large issues to cover budget shortfalls.
The stricter limitations contained in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on
bonds issued for private activity purposes and issued by tax-exempt entities
other than hospitals are reportedly beginning to constrain the issuance of
tax-exempt debt. For example, the $150 million cap on outstanding debt
issued by individual non-profit institutions now precludes twenty-four
universities from issuing additional tax-exempt debt. In addition, several
states, including California, have reached their $50 per capita limit on
outstanding private activity debt.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage debt growth appears to have been maintained into the new year
at about the fourth-quarter pace of 7-1/4 percent, despite continued
shedding of mortgage assets by the thrift industry. Mortgage-related
lending by banks continued robust through February, with the strength
evidently still concentrated in single-family mortgages, home equity lines,
and mortgage-backed securities. Thrift institutions, on the other hand,
have continued to disinvest mortgage assets held either as whole loans or as
mortgage pass-through securities, but at a considerably more moderate pace
than the 20 percent annual rate of decline recorded in December at SAIF-
insured institutions. On balance, however, there does not appear to be any
shortfall in credit availability, especially for residential mortgage
credit: There has been no significant widening in yield spreads of either
fixed or adjustable-rate mortgages over Treasuries of comparable maturities.
Pricing of mortgages and mortgage securities has been adjusting to the
market's gradual recognition that prepayments on fixed-rate mortgages have

slowed during the past three years by more than would be expected given
changes in market interest rates. Lower inflation in housing prices
resulting in reduced economic incentives for homeowners to move, as well as
a shift to ARMs by relatively mobile households, appear to have contributed
to the slowdown in prepayments on fixed-rate mortgages. Responding in part
to the increased popularity of ARMs with more mobile households, FNMA is
promoting fixed-rate products targeted on homebuyers who want the security
of fixed-rate financing but who expect to move within a few years of the
purchase of a home. These loans carry a fixed interest rate for the first
seven years and amortize according to a thirty-year schedule. At the end of
seven years, the borrower can extend the loan for another 23 years, using
then-current interest rates. The main attraction to borrowers is the loan's
lower interest rate compared to standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.
Since the previous FOMC meeting, contract rates on fixed-rate mortgages
rose 17 basis points to 10.34 percent. In response to higher market rates
since late last year, the Department of Veteran Affairs in February raised
the ceiling rate on loans it guarantees to 10 percent. In the market for
adjustable-rate mortgages, initial rate discounting has continued to
moderate. Only 55 percent of the ARMs originated in early January carried
1. The VA ceiling rate tends to serve also as the market standard contract
rate for home loans insured by the FHA. Based on a survey of lenders, the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that about 12
percent of all mortgage-loan originations (measured in dollars) on 1-4
family homes in the last half of 1989 were insured by FHA or VA. The
National Association of Realtors estimates that fully 35 percent of
originations for home purchase (measured in number of loans) were insured by
FHA or VA, based on a survey of its members. Because FHA/VA loans are
significantly smaller on average than conventional loans, these two
estimates are not necessarily inconsistent.

half of the discounts were for less than 2 percentage points.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at a 6 percent annual rate
in January, equal to the average pace for all of last year, and a little
slower than in December. After increasing faster than consumption spending
over the first three years of the current economic expansion, consumer
credit growth has roughly matched the spending pace since 1986,
2notwithstanding some divergence in quarter-to-quarter movements.
January's increase in consumer credit was held down by a 2 percent
annual rate of increase in revolving credit; in December, that component had
surged at a 24 percent rate. Revolving credit frequently moves erratically
in December and January because the proportions of Christmas season
transactions entering lenders' books in each of these months can vary
substantially from year to year, complicating seasonal adjustment. Looking
through the near-term volatility, revolving credit appears to have slowed
somewhat recently: From the end of the third quarter through January, it
grew at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate, compared with 15-1/2 percent over the
first nine months of 1989.
While revolving credit was slowing, the growth of automobile credit
picked up in January to nearly an 8 percent annual rate from 2 percent in
both the fourth quarter and 1989 as a whole. A rebound in new-car sales in
2. A pattern of initial growth more rapid than consumption and subsequent
parity of growth rates is typical of consumer credit over an extended
upward movement in a business cycle. This pattern owes partly to the
behavior of debt repayments, which grow relatively slowly early in an
expansion (reflecting reduced credit extensions in the previous recession),
then pick up later in the cycle, providing more of an offset to new
borrowing.

III-20
January, stimulated by expanded offerings of price rebates and low-rate
loans, spurred the faster auto credit growth. Reflecting the below-market
rates on some transactions, the average finance rate on new-car loans at the
auto finance companies declined 5/8 percentage point in January to
12-5/8 percent.

1. Weighted average of separate categories, excluding credit cards.
Measures of household debt repayment problems, which generally had
worsened in the third quarter of 1989, improved somewhat during the fourth
quarter. Auto loan delinquencies at the auto finance companies edged down
after several quarters of steady increases. Delinquencies on bank credit
cards fell fairly sharply in the fourth quarter to a relatively low level,
according to the American Bankers Association (ABA). The ABA's average
delinquency rate on a variety of closed-end consumer loans at commercial
banks also declined moderately in the fourth quarter, following a sharp jump
in the previous quarter. As indicated in the section on bank credit,
3. The third-quarter climb had raised the rate from the middle of its
historical range to its upper bound, but had appeared suspect because none
of the component loan types experienced increases as big as the overall
increase. In the fourth quarter, delinquencies rose for some components and
fell for others, but seemed consistent with a decline on average.

III-21
above, call report data for large banks showed a small increase in consumer
loan delinquencies in the fourth quarter. The quarterly movements of the
call report series have deviated from the pattern of the ABA series, but
both were up moderately over 1989.
Delinquencies on home mortgages generally have shown less evidence of
repayment problems in recent months than the consumer loan series. The
proportion of mortgages 60 or more days past due, reported by the Mortgage
Bankers Association (MBA), declined slightly in the fourth quarter, leaving
the delinquency rate at about the level prevailing at the beginning of 1989,
which was the lowest in eight years.
In contrast to the general improvement in delinquency experience in the
fourth quarter of last year, personal bankruptcy filings rose rather
sharply, reversing a small decline in the previous quarter. For the full
year, personal bankruptcies rose 12 percent, about in line with the
increases of the previous two years, but well below the 20-to-30 percent
increases of 1985 and 1986. It is difficult to interpret the upward trend
in bankruptcies in the past few years because changes in bankruptcy law have
made it a more attractive remedy to borrowers for debt payment problems.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened to $9.3 billion in
January (seasonally adjusted, Census basis), from an unusually low $7.7
billion deficit (revised) in December, but was still less than the
fourth-quarter average. A sharp, 7 percent increase in the value of
imports was partly offset by a 4 percent rise in the value of exports.
A jump in oil imports, both in quantity and in price, accounted for
two-thirds of the rise in total imports in January. The quantity of oil
imports reached 9-1/2 million barrels per day (mb/d) in January,

The price of imported oil rose nearly $2.00 per barrel in January,
reflecting the earlier run-up in spot prices associated with the
December cold snap and supply disruptions in the centrally planned
economies. Given shipping and contract lags and the recent behavior of
spot prices, the import price is estimated to have averaged a little
over $20 per barrel during the first quarter.
Non-oil imports also rose strongly in January, reversing about half
of their sharp decline during December; the January level was less than
the average for the fourth quarter. Strong increases in some categories
were partly offset by a sharp decline in imports of automotive products.
Imports of consumer goods in January returned to levels recorded in the
September-November period from a low recorded in December. Imported
consumer goods had accounted for much of the 1-1/2 percent rise in non-
oil imports during the fourth quarter despite the drop in December.
Imports of industrial supplies and foods also rose strongly in January,
to levels well above their fourth-quarter averages. The decline in
imports of automotive products continued a downtrend begun a year ago,

and also reflected effects of reduced U.S. automotive production in
January. Virtually all of the rise in total non-oil imports during
fourth-quarter was in quantity, as prices were up only marginally. This
trend in prices appears to have continued in January, as discussed
further below.

Exports rose strongly in January, by 3-1/2 percent over the fourth
quarter average. Changes in definitions of the data beginning in
January make it impossible at this time to assess with any precision the
movements in exports by disaggregated trade categories between the
fourth quarter and January. Two categories of trade formerly reported
as single aggregate figures, "reexports" and "undocumented exports to
Canada," were spread among appropriate trade categories; trade in these
two categories in 1989 averaged more than $2.5 billion per month.

Historical revisions at a later date will eventually allow us to make
these comparisons.

Total exports were up only slightly in the fourth quarter in both
value and quantity, but as can be seen in the table above, the
composition of exports shifted significantly. The strike at Boeing from
early October to late November disrupted shipments of aircraft, and
reduced the rate of those exports substantially, compared with the strong
fourth-quarter pace. This decline was offset by increases in exports of
a broad array of other products, notably consumer goods, automotive
products, and various machinery items. The sharp increase in "other
nonagricultural" exports results from changes in the definition of
"minimum value shipments." On October 1, the exemption level for filing
export declarations was raised, and goods were shifted out of the other
categories into the "minimum value" category (which is estimated by the
Commerce Department). A 4 percent increase in the value of agricultural
exports was led by increased shipments of corn to the Soviet Union, and
soybeans to Japan and Western Europe.
Import and Export Prices
In January, import prices as reported by the BLS rose 1.4 percent.
The increase was led by sharply higher prices for imported petroleum.
The index of prices for non-oil imports rose just 0.2 percent, a rate of
increase near that of the preceding four months. Prices of exports
increased 1.1 percent in January; the increase was largely in fuels (part
of industrial supplies) and agricultural prices. Data for February will
be released on March 22, and will be included in the Greenbook
supplement.
In the fourth quarter of 1989, the average price of imports rose
almost 5 percent at an annual rate, as price increases were recorded
across most major categories of trade. Oil prices increased over 30

percent, reversing the decline registered in the third quarter, and
resumed the upward trend recorded in the first half of the year. Prices
of non-oil products increased in the fourth quarter following two
quarters of declines. Part of the increase in non-oil import prices was
associated with the depreciation of the dollar since last October. This
was particularly true for those price changes recorded for capital goods
and consumer goods, many of which are invoiced in foreign currencies;
for these goods, changes in exchange rates are reflected immediately in
changes in their recorded dollar import prices. Price movements for
other trade categories in the fourth quarter reflected individual U.S.
market conditions (food price changes reflected continued increases in
the price of meat and a sharp upturn in the volatile price series for
fruits and vegetables; industrial supplies prices responded largely to
declines in prices for metals and building materials; and automotive
prices reflected increases associated with the introduction of a new
model year).
Export prices declined slightly in the fourth quarter, as a small
increase in the average price of nonagricultural exports was offset by a
large decline in the prices of agricultural exports. Prices of exported
capital goods, consumer goods, and automotive products rose slightly in
nearly every month of 1989, and at about the same rate as comparable
domestic prices. This suggests that the exporters of these products
allowed their prices in foreign currencies to vary with movements in
dollar exchange rates.
U.S. Current Account in the Fourth Quarter of 1989
The U.S. current account deficit (excluding capital gains and
losses) narrowed to $98 billion (saar) in the fourth quarter, from $102

billion (revised) in the third quarter. The improvement in the fourth
quarter was more than accounted for by an increase in net direct
investment income receipts (line 5), reflecting primarily higher
operating earnings by U.S. companies abroad. In addition, income
payments on foreign direct investment in the United States declined
slightly. Net portfolio income payments (line 6) were little changed on

payments. Unilateral transfers (line 9) rose substantially in the11.

fourth quarter when Israel drew nearly all of the U.S. government grant
funds provided for the fiscal year beginning October 1. For the year
1989, the current account deficit (excluding capital gains and losses)
was $104 billion, $22 billion smaller than in 1988.
As indicated in line 11, capital gains on U.S. direct investment
holdings abroad rose sharply in the second half of 1989, as a result of
the depreciation of the dollar. Published current account deficit
figures, which include such gains and losses, showed an improvement from
the third to the fourth quarter of $9.4 billion. For 1989, the
published current account deficit was $106 billion, $21 billion smaller
than in 1988.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Banks reported capital inflows of more than $13 billion in December
and capital outflows of $7 billion in January, on a month-end basis
(line 1 of the Summary Table of U.S. International Transactions).
Federal Reserve data indicate that the inflow in December was almost
entirely an end-of-year event; agencies and branches of foreign banks
increased net liabilities to affiliates abroad and IBFs by more than $7
billion in the last week of the year, and then decreased these
liabilities by more than $20 billion in the first week of January.
Line 1 of the International Banking Data Table, which shows monthly
averages of banks' daily positions vis-a-vis their own foreign offices
and IBFs, indicates a modest inflow in January and an additional $3
billion inflow in February.
Private foreigners on net purchased $4-1/4 billion of U.S.
corporate bonds and U.S. government agency bonds in December (line 2a of
the Summary Table); in January these net purchases slowed to $2-1/4

billion as differentials on-long-term interest rates moved in favor of
bonds denominated in foreign currencies. Smaller net purchases by
Japanese investors accounted for almost all of the slowing. Private
foreigners on net continued to sell U.S. stocks in December (line 2b),
though the pace of net sales slowed to less than $1/2 billion in
January.
U.S. residents purchased net $2-1/4 billion of foreign securities
in December (line 2c), almost half of which was in net purchases of
Canadian securities. In January, there was a general swing to net sales
with the largest sales in Europe.
Private foreign transactions in U.S. Treasury securities were small
on balance in December and January, following large net purchases in
November (line 3). The recent pattern of large purchases in the middle
month of the quarter, coincident with the Treasury's refunding, and
sales in subsequent months was evident. Although sales totaled only
$1/2 billion in December, this included purchases of $1-1/4 billion by
the World Bank and sales of about the same amount by Japanese investors.
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States declined $7
billion in December (line 4), with large decreases recorded for OPEC,
Korea, and Taiwan (line 4). The decline in Korean reserves in the
United States mirrored a decline in total reserves, while the decline in
Taiwan's reserves in the United States reflected active exchange market
intervention to support the NT dollar, and a smaller decline in total
reserves. Reserves held by G-10 countries in the United States declined
about $1 billion in December despite much larger reported dollar sales
associated with exchange market intervention. The intervention sales
apparently came largely out of G-10 holdings in the Eurodollar market,

IV-13
which would have been consistent with the narrowing of the spread
between rates on Eurodollar deposits and rates on U.S. Treasury
securities during December. In January, official reserve assets
declined $3-1/4 billion with most of the decline in holdings by the NIEs
and Mexico. Partial data from FRBNY show a $3-1/2 billion decline in
official holdings in February, with most of the decline attributable to
G-10 countries.
Foreign direct investment in the United States remained very strong
in the fourth quarter, in part reflecting continued take-over activity.
For 1989 as a whole, direct investment inflows to the United States
totaled more than $60 billion. The United Kingdom was the largest
single source, with about $21 billion. The rest of Western Europe
accounted for a similar amount, while inflows from Japan totaled about
$12-1/2 billion for the year.
U.S. direct investment abroad also continued at a substantial pace
in the fourth quarter (line 6), although capital gains from currency
translation elevated the figure by about $4-1/2 billion (quarterly
rate). For 1989 as a whole, the outflow of direct investment totaled
more than $32 billion. Net capital losses for the year, largely on
account of changes in exchange rates, had only a negligible impact;
losses were large in the first half when the dollar was appreciating,
but they were nearly offset by gains in the second half as the dollar
depreciated. Direct investment in the United Kingdom accounted for
almost $11 billion of the outflow, and the rest of Western Europe for
about $8 billion. Flows to Japan were less than $200 million.
1. Direct investment capital flows include net changes in equity
holdings and intercompany accounts as well as reinvested earnings. The
capital flows may differ from the expansion of U.S. affiliates of
foreign companies because of financing within the United States.

IV-14
The statistical discrepancy in the U.S. international accounts
jumped to $35 billion in 1989, more than reversing the negative $11
billion in 1988 (line 10). Wide swings in the statistical discrepancy
from quarter to quarter may very well reflect inconsistencies in the
reported timing of counterpart transactions. For example, the
transactional counterpart to large end-of-period bank flows may not be
captured in the same quarter as the bank flow.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted, foreign exchange value of the dollar against
the other G-10 currencies has risen 3 percent since the February FOMC
meeting, as shown in the accompanying chart. The dollar benefited from
data suggesting that the U.S. economy may have bottomed out, as well as
concern about a pick-up in inflation abroad. The dollar gained 6
percent against the yen and 3 percent against the mark during the
intermeeting period. Bond yields in Germany and Japan were up sharply,
probably reflecting concern about the outlook for inflation. Japanese
stock prices declined 17 percent. German stock prices rose 1-1/2
percent, on balance, boosted by the results of the East German
elections.
In Germany, talk of rapid movement toward German economic and
monetary union generated worries about the inflationary impact of German
reunification. Financial markets were buffeted by rumors and official
statements regarding the terms and timing of monetary union, with most
attention paid to the politically popular proposal to convert all or
most of East German savings in Ost Marks one-for-one into Deutsche
Marks. Reversing the course it had followed since the opening of the
East German border in November, the mark weakened against the dollar and

IV-15
most EMS currencies. The Bundesbank kept official and overnight market
rates steady, but 3-month German rates rose 30 basis points. Late in
the period, following the victory of the conservative Alliance for
Germany in the East German elections, the mark strengthened somewhat.
In Japan, a favorable showing by the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party in the February 18 parliamentary elections failed to support the
yen or reassure Japanese financial markets. Open disagreement between
the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance over an increase in the
discount rate delayed until March 20 an increase of a full percentage
point to 5-1/4 percent. After remaining unchanged throughout most of
the intermeeting period, the Japanese call money rate rose almost 50
basis points in the week preceding the discount rate hike. The 3-month
CD rate rose 65 basis points since the last FOMC meeting.
In the United Kingdom, sterling weakened as the U.K. trade picture
failed to improve and the ruling Conservative Party lost political
ground in the wake of the imposition of a poll tax. Sterling was also
hurt by the negative outlook for inflation in the U.K. budget. Since
the February FOMC meeting, the dollar has risen 6 percent against
sterling.
The dollar has lost nearly 1-1/2 percent, on balance, against the
Canadian dollar. Early in the intermeeting period, the Canadian dollar
continued its decline begun after the Bank of Canada's easing move in
January. In light of the exchange rate response, the Bank of Canada
moved short-term interest rates back above their mid-January levels and
this halted and later reversed the decline of the Canadian currency.

The Desk sold
$1,480 million against yen and $200 million against marks.
On March 2, Korea implemented a new exchange-rate system. In the
previous system, the Bank of Korea each day fixed the won mid-rate
against the dollar, based loosely on a trade-weighted basket of major
foreign currencies. This system had been criticized as manipulative by
the United States. In the new system, the won-dollar mid-rate is a
weighted-average of the previous day's spot interbank transactions.
Buying and selling rates are set by banks within a band around the
official mid-rate. The current band for won-dollar transactions set by
the cent.al bank is 0.4 percent, unchanged from the previous band. The
Korean won has depreciated another 1.5 percent since the time of the
last Greenbook after depreciating 3 percent from its peak last April.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in the continental European countries has
generally been strong, while in other industrial countries it has been
mixed. Growth of real GNP in Germany picked up in the fourth quarter,
making 1989 annual growth 3.7 percent. In France and Italy, recent data
also indicate sustained growth. In Japan, industrial production has
grown slowly in recent months, but retail sales have surged. Real GDP
(s.a.a.r.) grew 3 percent in the fourth quarter. In both Canada and the
United Kingdom, domestic demand has remained strong, while output
appears to have slowed.

IV-18
Recorded inflation has picked up in Germany and Canada since the
beginning of the year, but has remained generally stable in the other
major industrial countries. In Japan, the depreciating yen has
increased inflationary pressures, although this has yet to be fully
reflected in recorded inflation levels. Appreciating currencies have
helped moderate inflation in Germany and France.
Current account imbalances show signs of narrowing in Japan,
France, and the United Kingdom, but have widened in Germany and Canada.
Italy's current account deficit has remained about unchanged since mid-
1989.
Government budgets for the fiscal year beginning April 1 have been
announced in Canada and the United Kingdom. In Germany, events in East
Germany have dominated policy discussions. Officials in the two
countries have formed a commission to study economic and monetary union,
and the West German government has approved a supplemental budget to
support East Germany.
Individual Country Notes. Japanese real GNP (s.a.a.r.) increased 3
percent in the fourth quarter. This was a sharp slowing from the rapid
12.2 percent growth rate in the previous quarter, but the increase from
year-earlier levels eased only slightly to 4.7 percent. This fourth
quarter slowing reflected lower, but still strong, growth of domestic
demand and a sharp swing from a positive to a negative contribution from
the external sector. Consumption increased at a 6.5 percent annual rate
in the fourth quarter. Plant and equipment spending increased at a
strong 16.2 percent rate, and residential investment was up at an 8.4
percent rate. The substantial negative contribution from net exports

reflected a sharp slowing in real exports (to a 4 percent growth rate)
and a surge in real imports (to a 27.9 percent growth rate).
Indications of the pace of activity in January have been mixed.
Industrial production (s.a.) increased only 0.1 percent in January,
lowering the 12-month increase to 1.9 percent. However, retail sales
(s.a.) surged 3.6 percent in January, for a 12-month increase of 11.9
percent. The unemployment rate (s.a.), after in December reaching its
lowest level since 1981, edged up to 2.2 percent in January.

The recorded rate of consumer price inflation has continued to
increase, in part because of the weakness of the yen. Consumer prices
(n.s.a.) in the Tokyo area rose 0.5 percent in February, raising the 12-
month rate to 3.9 percent, up from 3.4 percent the previous month. Part
of this increase in consumer prices in February was attributed to a
temporary increase in perishable food prices. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.)
increased 0.1 percent in February and were up 3.5 percent from their
year-earlier level. The wholesale price index of imported goods
(n.s.a.) rose 1.3 percent in February, primarily because of the weak
yen.

IV-23
The current account appears to have been contracting since last
spring; the cumulative surplus in the nine months through January, at
$43.3 billion (s.a.a.r.), was substantially below the $57.2 billion
current account surplus rate for 1989 as a whole. Despite this
improvement, the trade surplus (s.a.) rose in February, and the current
account surplus (s.a.) increased in January, compared to the preceding
months.
Economic activity in Germany appears to have picked up in recent
months. Industrial production rose further in January, particularly in
the construction sector, which benefited from unusually mild weather.
Construction activity (s.a.) rose 24 percent in January to a level 2.6
percent above the previous record level of January 1989, which was also
a month of mild weather. Although the volume of manufacturers' new
orders (s.a.) fell 5.5 percent in January, the level of orders was still
5.7 percent above year-earlier levels.
The unemployment rate has declined from 7.7 percent in December to
7.4 percent in February. These figures are indicative of the strong
growth of labor demand in recent months, but they do not fully reflect
the continuing influx of immigrants from East Europe. Immigrants
arriving after the beginning of the year are not eligible for
unemployment benefits for two months and are consequently not yet
included in measured unemployment. Over 150,000 immigrants from East
Europe have arrived in the FRG since the beginning of 1990, with 130,000
coming from East Germany alone.
Real GNP increased 3.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter.
This strong growth came in spite of a sharp 22.8 percent increase in

IV-24
imports (s.a.a.r.). The main source of strength was fixed investment,
which grew at an annual rate of almost 20 percent. Inventory investment
was also strong. For 1989 as a whole, real growth was 3.7 percent, with
the principal sources of strength'being fixed investment and exports,
which increased 8.4 and 7.3 percent, respectively.
Although the strength of the DM in recent months has held producer
and wholesale prices down, consumer prices have continued to increase.
Consumer prices (n.s.a.) rose 0.6 and 0.3 percent in January and
February, respectively. On a 12-month basis, consumer price inflation
has declined from 3 percent in November and December to 2.7 percent in
January and 2.6 percent in February. This decline in measured inflation
took place in part because the excise tax increases that raised consumer
prices in January 1989 (by about 0.7 percent) were not reflected in 12-
month measures of CPI inflation after December 1989. Wholesale prices
were only 0.6 percent above their year-earlier level in February, down
from 1.4 percent in January. Producer prices were unchanged between
October and February. Import prices declined 1.8 percent in the fourth
quarter in response to the sharp appreciation of the DM. In January,
import prices were actually 1.7 percent below year-earlier levels.
Germany's external surpluses (n.s.a.) increased sharply in January
from the fourth quarter. Most of the change came through a 9 percent
increase in exports.
Economic policy has been dominated in recent months by developments
in East Germany. On February 13, Chancellor Kohl and East German Prime
Minister Modrow agreed to establish a joint commission to study
proposals for establishing economic and monetary union. The Commission

IV-25
will discuss three main topics: purely monetary aspects of the proposed
union, including the rate of exchange at which Ostmark assets will be
converted into Deutschemarks; other economic reforms that need to be
implemented in the GDR; and distributional issues, including means of
protecting the savings of East Germans. It is expected that a monetary
union will be established around mid-year. On February 14, the West
German federal government approved a supplemental budget of DM 7 billion
to support East Germany.
Activity in France has shown signs of renewed strength. Household
consumption of manufactured products (s.a.) grew 4.2 percent from
December to January, after having posted declines three of the previous
four months. GDP (s.a.a.r.) grew 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter,
after growing only 2 percent the previous quarter. Industrial
production (s.a.) was weaker than GDP in the fourth quarter.
Inflation remains moderate. The CPI rose 0.3 percent in January,
and preliminary government estimates for February inflation are 0.2-0.3
percent. In part, this inflation performance is due to the strength of
the French franc against non-European currencies; between February 1989
and February 1990 the franc appreciated 9.7 percent against the dollar,
and the price index of imported commodities fell 23.2 percent.
The trade deficit widened to $7.2 billion in 1989, from $5.4
billion in 1988. However, an expanding surplus in service transactions,
largely due to tourist revenues, has helped the current account; as a
result France posted a current account deficit of $3.1 billion in 1989,
down from $3.4 billion in 1988.

IV-26
In Italy, industrial production (s.a.) grew 3.3 percent in the
fourth quarter, the largest increase since the first quarter of 1988.
Consumer price inflation on a 12-month basis was 6.3 percent in both
January and February.
Preliminary current account data on a balance-of-payments basis
indicate that the deficit for 1989 increased sharply to $10.9 billion,
from $5.4 billion in 1988, although the bulk of this deterioration
occurred in the first half of 1989. The largest deteriorations occurred
in the tourism balance (which deteriorated by $1.7 billion), the
investment-income balance ($1.6 billion), and the trade balance ($1.2
billion).
The budget deficit for 1989 of the State Sector (consisting of the
central government plus agencies) was 133 trillion lira ($97 billion
equivalent), slightly above the 1988 deficit of 130 trillion lira. The
deficit declined slightly as a share of GDP to 11 percent, but was still
16 trillion lira above its original target set in the fall of 1988. The
target for 1990 is set at 133 trillion lira.
While the the growth of output has continued to slow in the United
Kingdom, consumer spending has remained surprisingly strong. Real GDP
(s.a.a.r.) grew 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter, after expanding 2.8
percent in the third quarter. For the third consecutive month,
industrial production (s.a.) fell in January, to a level only 0.3
percent above a year ago. However, consumer credit surged in January
and the volume of retail sales (s.a.) rose 2.4 percent in February to a
level 2.6 percent above a year ago. Strong consumer spending was also
indicated by a surge in imports in January, which caused an unexpected

IV-27
deterioration in trade and current account balances. The unemployment
rate continued to fall in February, reaching 5.6 percent.
The annual rate of consumer price inflation stayed at 7.7 percent
in January, while the underlying rate (excluding mortgage interest
payments) remained at its peak of 6.1 percent. Average earnings in
January rose 9.1 percent on a 12-month basis, while the underlying
annual rate of increase in average earnings remained at 9.25 percent.
On March 20, Chancellor John Major delivered the British budget to
Parliament. The budget was broadly neutral and projected a surplus of
7 billion for the 1990-91 fiscal year, the same as that estimated for
1989-90. Thatcher's government has come under increasing criticism
lately, in part because of widespread demonstrations against the poll
tax, the new set of community charges to be levied starting April 1 on
every person of voting age.
Real GDP (s.a.a.r.) in Canada in the fourth quarter grew 2 percent,
down slightly from the upwardly revised 2.5 percent growth rate of the
third quarter. Growth for 1989 was 2.4 percent. Final domestic demand,
which was sluggish in the third quarter, was unexpectedly robust in the
fourth quarter, expanding 6.8 percent, as the pace of both consumption
and investment picked up. A sharp drop in real net exports, primarily
due to growth in imports, was largely responsible for the slower overall
growth. The current account deficit (s.a.) jumped from $4.0 billion
(s.a.) in the third quarter to $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter.
Other data point generally to slower growth in the Canadian
economy. In February, although the unemployment rate (s.a.) fell 0.1
percentage point to 7.7 percent, the index of help-wanted advertisements

IV-28
(n.s.a.) fell 4.3 percent, the sixth consecutive monthly decline.
Housing starts (s.a.a.r.) dropped 6.9 percent in January, and new car
sales (s.a.) fell 3.1 percent in December.
Consumer price inflation remains a concern after large monthly
increases in January and February. The CPI (n.s.a.) rose 0.6 percent in
February to a level 5.4 percent above a year earlier. The CPI excluding
food and energy (n.s.a.) rose 0.5 percent, or 5.2 percent from a year
before.
Last month, Finance Minister Wilson presented the budget for the
1990-91 fiscal year. Wilson stated that the government is on track to
hit its C$30.5 billion deficit in 1989-90 (approximately 4.7 percent of
GDP); the 1990-91 deficit is projected to be C$28.5 billion, only C$500
million above last year's forecast. High interest rates on existing
government debt continue to hamper efforts to reduce the deficit.
Developments in East European Economies
In late January, the IMF and the government of Hungary reached
agreement on a letter of intent for a new IMF stand-by arrangement (SBA)
for SDR 159 million ($206 million equivalent). The IMF Board approved
the new SBA on March 15. The SBA relies on prior actions (including
depreciation of the forint; increased interest rates, increased rents
and taxes on housing subsidies; and closure or restructuring of loss-
making enterprises). However also on March 15, the new Constitutional
Court of Hungary struck down the tax on housing subsidies. Moreover,
inflation (a.r.) of over 22 percent in January already exceeds targets
in the program. Recent IMF programs were allowed to expire due to non-
compliance on quantitative performance criteria -- specifically the

IV-29
government budget and current account deficits. Elections are scheduled
for March 25.
Poland signed an agreement with the Paris Club in February to
reschedule $9.4 billion of service payments on official debt. Poland's
external debt to official and private creditors totals about $40
billion, with about $30 billion of this owed to Paris Club members. The
rescheduling includes $3.4 billion in interest arrears as of the end of
1989 and 100 percent of the principal and interest due through the end
of 1991. In early February, the IMF agreed on a 13-month, SDR 550
million ($723 million equivalent) stand-by arrangement, and the World
Bank approved two loan agreements totaling $360 million, with twice that
much in the pipeline.
On March 16, the IMF Board approved an 18-month, SDR 460 million
($610 million equivalent) stand-by arrangement for Yugoslavia.
Substantial reform measures were implemented in recent months, meeting
IMF requirements.
U.S. bank lending to foreigners
The dollar value of U.S.-chartered banks' claims on all foreigners
decreased by $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 1989. Excluding the
estimated increase in value due to the effects of changes in the value
of the dollar on U.S. banks' nondollar-denominated assets, total U.S.
bank claims on foreigners decreased an estimated $11 billion in the
fourth quarter. In all of 1989 U.S. bank claims on all foreigners
declined $6 billion on an exchange rate-adjusted basis.
U.S. bank claims on non-OPEC developing countries declined $2.8
billion in the fourth quarter, in line with declines of the previous two

IV-30
quarters, and a continuation of the longer term trend of a reduction in
U.S. bank exposure to these countries. A decrease in claims of $1.2
billion on Argentina in the fourth quarter resulted primarily from debt
writeoffs due to mandated reserving actions, and a decrease in claims on
Brazil of $1.7 billion was largely associated with writeoffs and
informal conversions of Brazilian debt at prices below par. U.S. banks
reported an increase of $0.8 billion in claims on Mexico in the fourth
quarter of 1989. That increase resulted largely from a collateralized
loan backed by existing Mexican holdings of U.S. Treasury securities,
which allowed Mexico to manage its liquidity and reserve needs without
selling the securities outright. Data through year-end 1989 indicate
that U.S. banks have not expanded their relatively minor exposure to
Eastern Europe.
As indicated in the chart with data through March 16, 1990, the
secondary market prices of bank loans to the heavily indebted countries
increased in the first quarter from the depressed levels at year-end.
The increase in the price of Brazilian debt through March 1 reflected
optimism that the country's newly elected President would not take a
confrontational stand with banks. However, that price has declined in
the last two weeks reflecting uncertainty about the government's new
economic program. An increase in the price of Mexican debt resulted
from the signing of the restructuring agreement with the banks. There
was some market optimism that Venezuela would complete its negotiation
of a financing package with its creditor banks and would eliminate its
interest arrears to banks of roughly.

Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Brazilian officials announced on March 16 the new government's
program intended to reduce inflation dramatically in the coming months.
The bank debt package for Mexico is expected to be implemented on March
28. On March 4 the Argentine government announced a new set of fiscal
measures aimed at generating savings equivalent to 3 percent of GDP. In
mid-March Venezuela and its commercial bank creditors reached agreement
on the terms of debt and debt service reduction and new money options
for a financing package. To preserve their claims against Peru before
the expiration of a six-year statute of limitations, several
international banks sued Peru on March 2. The Philippines signed a new
money agreement for $709 million with some 80 commercial banks on
February 28.
Individual country notes. One day after taking office March 15,
Brazil's new president, Fernando Collor de Mello, announced a program
aimed at reducing inflation over the next few months. The program
includes the following:
1. Prices and wages will be frozen for 45 days, after which wages
will be adjusted monthly by an unknown amount. Price controls will be
strictly enforced throughout the period. The adjustment for wages and
prices effective May 1 will be announced April 15. Increases in wages
in the private sector can be negotiated beyond the established
adjustment after May 1, but employers will not be allowed to pass on
higher wage costs to consumers.
2. Cash and cruzado-denominated assets worth less than 50,000 New
Cruzados (about $1,200 at the old official exchange rate) will be

IV-35
converted into the new unit of account, the cruzeiro, by a conversion
factor 1000 to 1. Determination of the cruzeiro value of all other
cruzado-denominated assets is more complex. If, over the next 18
months, an investor wishes to withdraw funds from an account, the
cruzeiro value of the cruzado-denominated asset will be determined in
auctions conducted by the central bank. Interest on funds remaining in
the accounts over the next 18 months will be equal to a 6 percent real
annualized return. An estimated $80 to $120 billion, out of $150
billion in cruzado-denominated savings, is affected by this measure.
3. Capital gains taxes will be introduced and all tax payments
will be indexed. Bearer instruments will be abolished. Selected
financial institutions will be subject to a "compulsory loan."
4. The government will close several ministries, lay off public
sector workers, and cease its subsidization of exports and other
sectors. Public sector companies will be privatized. Public sector
prices will be adjusted upward.
5. The official exchange rate will be allowed to float, but
authorities will intervene to manage the float. The exchange rate
against the U.S. dollar had previously been adjusted each day, but in
recent months the adjustment had lagged inflation.
6. The trade regime will gradually be liberalized. Quantitative
controls will be phased out, so that only tariffs will remain. The list
of imports with prohibitive tariffs will be eliminated.
Most of the measures have been implemented by presidential decree.
The Brazilian Congress will need to approve most of the measures within
30 days.

IV-36
Financial markets reopened Monday following a three-day bank
holiday. Amid general uncertainty, there were few transactions in the
stock market and the parallel market for the dollar, but by Tuesday the
cruzado had strengthened to about 45 cruzados to the dollar compared to
80 cruzados before the bank holiday.
Not enough is yet known to determine whether the measures will
significantly reduce the fiscal deficit, the main cause of Brazil's high
inflation. The government estimates that the operational deficit (i.e.,
the fiscal deficit net of the inflation premium that the government pays
in interest on the government debt), will be reduced from a pre-program
estimate for 1990 of 8 percent of GDP to a surplus of 2 percent.
Monthly inflation rose from 56 percent in January to 73 percent in
February, and is expected to be 80 percent in March. Despite the high
inflation rates in 1989, real GDP grew 3.6 percent last year compared
with no growth in 1988.
The trade surplus of $768 million in February exceeded January's
surplus of $659 million. However, the appreciation in the real exchange
rate over the past few months has led to a considerable fall in the
trade surplus. The surplus for the four months through January 1990 was
$3.3 billion, down from $5.7 billion a year ago.
Mexico's agreement with commercial banks, providing debt reduction,
interest reduction, and new money options, began to be signed on
February 4 and is expected to be implemented on March 28. Until then,
Mexico faces a cash flow problem because special factors related to the
bank agreement combine to concentrate in the first quarter more than
half of the expected 1990 current account deficit: (a) the bank

IV-37
agreement is retroactive to July 1, 1989, but Mexico is continuing to
pay interest under the pre-agreement conditions until implementation;
(b) in order to avoid an accumulation of accrued but unpaid interest
when the agreement goes into effect, Mexico began, last December, to pay
interest monthly, instead of quarterly, a move that resulted in a
bunching of interest payments in the first quarter; (c) the first
interest payment to the creditor banks after the agreement is
implemented will not be due for six months; and, (d) a rebate of the
excess interest payments being made currently will be deducted from the
initial interest payments due under the new conditions, beginning at the
end of September.
Two other factors are aggravating Mexico's first quarter cash flow
problem. One is repayment on February 15 of the remaining $1.2 billion
from last September's bridge loan from the United States, the BIS on
behalf of the central banks of the other G-10 countries, and Spain. The
other is that, when the bank agreement is implemented, Mexico will have
to provide about $1.3 billion toward the enhancement package that
supports the operation.
There has also been some nervousness in exchange markets for the
peso, prompted by an upsurge of the monthly inflation rate to 3.4
percent in December and 4.8 percent in January, from an average of 1.4
percent in the previous 11 months. The inflation surge reflected sharp
increases in public sector prices and in minimum wages. The February
inflation rate was 2.3 percent and lower rates are anticipated in coming
months. Domestic interest rates have risen sharply since mid-January.

The economic situation in Argentina has continued to deteriorate,
triggering the announcement of a new economic program. The previous
program, which was announced on January 1, 1990, successfully held the
exchange rate at about 2,000 australs per dollar during January by
freezing most bank time deposits and domestic government debt
instruments. However, in February the exchange rate depreciated
substantially, reaching about 5,800 australs per dollar by month's end,
reflecting concern that the government would not reduce the fiscal
deficit. Monthly inflation registered 79 percent in January and 62
percent in February compared with 40 percent in December 1989. February
consumer prices were up more than 12,000 percent over February 1989.
On March 4, the government announced a new set of fiscal adjustment
measures, including substantial increases in export taxes, the
retirement of many public sector workers, the permanent closing of some
official banks, and the postponement of payments to domestic suppliers.
The impact of this program on Argentina's fiscal situation is unclear.
According to government officials, the program could generate savings of
4 percent of GDP in 1990; however, the 1990 fiscal deficit was estimated
to exceed 10 percent of GDP, suggesting that the new program may not be
adequate.
The austral has strengthened considerably thus far in March, but
this is believed to reflect severe illiquidity in the banking system
rather than enhanced confidence in the economy. Short-term interbank
interest rates, which exceeded 300 percent (monthly basis) in early
March, have fallen considerably since then. Economic activity is
believed to be severely depressed; the trade surplus is estimated to

have increased by $1 billion in 1989 to more than $5 billion due to
strong exports and a recession-induced decline in imports.
On March 20, Venezuela announced an agreement in principle with its
major commercial bank creditors on a menu of options for a financing
package. The menu items that are to be offered to holders of the
country's medium- and long-term bank debt include:
1. New money option. Existing bank debt swapped at par for 17-
year Venezuelan bonds paying LIBOR + 7/8. For every $5 of debt
exchanged, creditor must purchase $1 worth of 15-year bonds paying LIBOR
+ 1. 30 percent of the new money bonds would be eligible for debt-to-
equity conversion at par.
2. Temporary interest rate reduction bond option. Existing bank
debt swapped at par for a 17-year Venezuelan bond with an interest rate
of 5 percent in years 1 and 2, 6 percent in years 3 and 4, 7 percent in
year 5, and LIBOR + 7/8 thereafter, carrying a 12-month rolling support
of interest.
3. Fixed-rate bond option. Existing debt swapped at par for a 30-
year Venezuelan bond carrying a fixed interest rate of 6-3/4 percent, a
14-month rolling support of interest, and a principal payment
collateralized by a creditor government zero coupon bond. The bonds
would come with detachable oil warrants that would be exercisable after
a 6-year grace period. These warrants would, in effect, boost the
interest rate paid on the bonds by up to 150 basis points if Venezuelan
oil export prices rise substantially in real terms.
4. Discount bond option. Existing debt swapped at a 30 percent
discount for a 30-year Venezuelan bond with an interest rate of LIBO +

IV-40
13/16, a 14-month rolling support of interest, and a principal payment
collateralized by a creditor government zero coupon bond. The bonds
would come with oil warrants (as in option #3).
5. Buy-back option. Venezuela would repurchase existing bank
debt, at a discount related to the price of the debt on the secondary
market. Venezuela is now working with its major bank creditors to
finalize a financing package, and market these options to the universe
of creditor banks.
On March 2, several major international banks filed a lawsuit
against Peru in a New York federal court over Peru's long-standing
arrears to the banks that now approach $4 billion. The lawsuit was
prompted by the desire to preserve the banks' claims against Peru from
possible expiration under the six-year statute of limitations for unpaid
debts under New York State law. Discussions are continuing on a
negotiated waiver of Peru's use of the statute of limitations defense,
which might lead to a withdrawal of the suit. Adding to the uncertainty
is the long transition period between the presidential elections this
April and the beginning of the new administration in July 1990.
The third part of the Philippine commercial bank debt agreement was
consummated on February 28 in Tokyo when 80 banks agreed to provide $709
million in new money to the Philippines. The Philippines had initially
hoped to raise $1 billion in new money. The funds will be provided
through the issue of 15-year Philippine government bonds that will be
listed on the Luxembourg exchange. The first part of the debt agreement
was completed on January 3, 1990, when the Philippines repurchased $1.34
billion of its commercial bank debt at a 50 percent discount. The

IV-41
second part of the debt agreement, which has also been completed,
involved a rescheduling of principal payments on commercial bank debt
falling due in 1990-94.
