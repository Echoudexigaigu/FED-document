The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The economy appears to be expanding, but at a pace below the growth
rate of potential output. The manufacturing sector, despite some
indications of possible improvement, has thus far remained sluggish, and
construction activity evidently is slipping after the weather-related bulge
earlier in the year. The service-producing sector has been the mainstay of
employment and income growth. Sharp increases in prices in the first
quarter undoubtedly overstated underlying trends, but labor cost increases
--along with rising import prices--have intensified inflationary pressures.
Employment and Unemployment
In April, total nonfarm payroll employment rose just 64,000, following
an upward revised increase of 103,000 in March. Growth in employment in
April reflected the addition of 78,000 temporary government workers to
conduct the Census, while private payrolls fell 64,000. The employment
figures continue to be buffeted by the effects of the unusual weather last
winter; going back to November, monthly employment growth averaged 122,000
per month--nearly the same pace as in the second half of 1989 but
considerably less than earlier in the expansion. The weather effect was
especially pronounced in construction employment, which fell sharply in
March and April after surging in January and February and is now at about
the same level as last fall. Meanwhile, employment in manufacturing fell
further last month, with widespread declines. In the private service-
producing sector, April was a relatively slow month for hiring, with finance
and real estate flat and business services down 13,000; the only notable
area of strong growth was health services.

The unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent in April. Much of the
rise in joblessness occurred among young adults, but the rate for adult men
also moved higher. Other data do not show much change in labor market
conditions. For example, the number of workers employed part-time
involuntarily dropped back in April, and initial claims for unemployment
insurance have been about flat since the beginning of the year.
Industrial Production
Industrial activity has remained flat, on balance, this year, although
the monthly figures have continued to be bounced around by large movements
in the output of motor vehicles, aircraft, and utilities. April industrial
production, which will be published early next week, appears to have
declined nearly 1/2 percent, based on preliminary estimates. Auto
assemblies were cut back to an annual rate of 5.8 million units (FRB basis)
from a 6.7 million unit rate in March, and production of trucks fell
after increasing during the previous two months. Excluding motor vehicles
and parts, industrial output apparently was little changed in April.
In the first quarter, total IP was pulled down by the inventory
correction in the motor vehicle industry and the effect of unseasonably mild
weather on output of utilities. On the positive side, aircraft production
returned to full capacity following the strike at Boeing in the fourth
quarter, and production of consumer durable goods was boosted by a rebound in
output of appliances and other home goods. However, output of consumer
nondurables such as clothing, food, and paper has weakened since the turn of
the year.

Among materials, output of basic metals edged up slightly during the
first quarter after declining sharply late last year. By contrast,
production of textiles, paper, and chemical materials weakened noticeably.
Autos and Light Trucks
Total sales of cars and light trucks in April, at a little over a
14 million unit rate, were close to the pace recorded in the first
quarter. Sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks were at a
10-3/4 million unit annual rate, while sales of imported models maintained
their 3-1/4 million unit pace. Incentive programs have changed little since
early February. Some programs at Ford originally were scheduled to expire
at the beginning of April, but these were extended first to the end of the
month and then to the end of May. Incentives at GM, which were scheduled to
expire May 2, were continued through July.

Assemblies of domestically produced cars have averaged only a little
above 5-1/2 million units so far this year; as a result, dealers'
inventories at the end of April had dropped to an estimated 1.32 million
units and continued to hover around the preferred 60 days supply. Current
schedules call for assemblies to remain below a 6-1/2 million unit rate
through the spring, a rate roughly in line with the recent trend in sales.
However, manufacturers' preliminary production plans for the third quarter
call for output to run at about 7 million units, a rate that may be a bit
optimistic if sales do not increase from their current pace.
Consumption and Personal Income
Real personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of
2-1/2 percent in the first quarter, according to BEA's advance estimate.
Consumer spending was boosted by the spurt in sales of cars and light trucks
early in the quarter and by the strong uptrend in outlays for nonenergy
services. In contrast, weather-related energy expenditures dropped sharply,
reflecting unseasonably warm temperatures in January and February following
colder-than-usual weather in December.
Excluding spending on weather-related energy items and motor vehicles,
personal consumption expenditures rose at a 3 percent annual rate, close to
the average pace over the second half of 1989. Outlays for nonenergy
services continued to be robust, with especially strong gains for spending
on medical care. Expenditures for goods other than fuel oil and motor
vehicles, however, rose only about 1 percent at an annual rate; real outlays
for food remained weak, and spending on apparel turned down sharply in
February and March, perhaps in response to the sharp rise in apparel

II-8
prices. In contrast, outlays for furniture and appliances posted a large
increase.
Disposable personal income, in nominal terms, grew at a 9-1/2 percent
annual rate in the first quarter, boosted in part by a bulge in subsidy
payments to farm proprietors. The rise in income was almost as large as the
increase in nominal outlays, and the saving rate remained in the
neighborhood of 5-1/2 percent. Because of the runup in consumer prices in
the first quarter, disposable personal income in real terms was up at only a
1-3/4 percent annual rate.
Consumer sentiment, according to the Michigan Survey Research Center,
improved moderately in April, reflecting respondents' more favorable
assessments of their current and expected personal financial situations.
Their expectations for inflation over the next twelve months, which had
moved up to almost 5-1/2 percent this winter, eased to 4-1/2 percent last
month. Consumers apparently are not optimistic about inflation over the
longer run: A new Board-sponsored question revealed that average inflation
expectations for the next five to ten years were about 5 percent.
Revisions to 1989 Personal Income
On the basis of data from state unemployment insurance tax records
through the third quarter of 1989, BEA tentatively expects to adjust down
the wage and salary component of personal income in 1989 by roughly $50
billion (about 1 percent of nominal 1989 personal income) when the GNP
accounts are revised in July. BEA has identified a number of contributing
factors: (1) seasonal adjustment difficulties resulting from the unusually

problems associated with difficulties in the seasonal adjustment of CPI
apparel prices.

II-9
large number of Fridays--a common payday--in 1988, 2 (2) likely downward
revisions to BEA's estimate of commissions paid to stockbrokers in 1989, and
(3) a smaller-than-anticipated bias adjustment in BEA's initial estimates of
wages and salaries made from the monthly establishment survey data. 3
Taken alone, the lower estimate of wage and salary income would show
through to personal saving, thus eliminating the sizable rise in the saving
rate from 1988 to 1989 now shown in the data. However, other components of
personal income frequently are revised substantially and could provide an
offset to lower wages and salaries. The downward revision in wages and
salaries also is likely to result in lower estimates of compensation per
hour, which is now estimated to have risen 5.4 percent over the four
quarters of 1989. The precise revision to compensation per hour is
difficult to pinpoint because we currently have no firm information on the
quarterly pattern of the anticipated change in income or the size of the
possible downward revisions to hours of work in 1989.
Business Inventories
Businesses appear to have tightened their inventory positions in recent
months. In addition to the sizable correction in auto dealers' stocks,
inventories in other manufacturing and trade industries posted a net
2. An extra Friday occurred in the third quarter of 1988 (which was a leap
year), raising the level of wages and salaries in that period. This
calendar effect on wages and salaries disappeared in the fourth quarter, but
because BEA's seasonal adjustment procedure spreads the extra income equally
over all months of the year, the seasonally adjusted level of wages and
salaries in December 1988 was overstated. BEA then estimated monthly
personal income for 1989 as a series of 12 monthly changes from this upward-
biased December 1988 base. Accordingly, the estimated level of wages and
salaries for 1989 was too high.
3. Over the preceding four years, benchmark estimates derived from U.I.
tax records had raised significantly initial estimates of growth in wages
and salaries made from the establishment survey. The upward adjustment for
1989 apparently was too large.

increase of only $3-1/2 billion (constant dollars, annual rate) in January
and February, compared with buildups of $12 billion in the fourth quarter
and about $19 billion from April to September last year. As a result, the
constant-dollar inventory-sales ratio in February was near the low end of
the range observed over the past year. For March, partial current-cost
information suggests that manufacturing inventories were reduced
significantly, while wholesale stocks were up only a little. 4
The drawdown of manufacturing stocks in February and March was
associated with a rebound in factory shipments. At the industry level,
stock declines were widespread among durable goods industries; sizable
runoffs were reported by producers of primary metals, fabricated metal
products, nonelectrical machinery, and motor vehicles--industries where
shipments rebounded in February and March. For most industries, the
inventory-to-shipments ratio was lower in March than at year-end. The
improvement in inventory positions, together with the moderate growth in new
orders in recent months, suggests that inventories should not be an
impediment to growth in production in the near term.
In the trade sector outside of autos, many types of establishments,
including retail apparel and general merchandise stores, also have trimmed
their inventories. In particular, the situation for general merchandise
stores improved significantly in February when sales advanced sharply and
inventories were reduced substantially. The inventory-sales ratio for

assumed in its advance estimate.

general merchandise stores dropped to a level that was close to the average
observed over the past several years.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment is estimated by BEA to have risen at a
7-1/2 percent annual rate in the first quarter--a figure that would appear
to overstate the underlying trend in this sector. Equipment purchases
increased 8-1/4 percent, as outlays for aircraft and motor vehicles
rebounded from transitory weakness in the fourth quarter. Excluding the
transportation sector, real equipment purchases rose 3-1/2 percent in the
first quarter, little changed from the pace over the second half of last
year. The gain reflected continued increases in spending for information
processing equipment--notably computers--while outlays for industrial
equipment posted a third quarter of essentially no growth.
Boosted by favorable weather, real outlays for nonresidential
structures rose at a 5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, after
falling 1 percent last year. A jump in industrial building, which has grown
steadily for the last year and a half, more than accounted for last
quarter's increase. A decline in outlays for drilling and mining
structures provided the largest negative contribution.
Recent indicators suggest that business investment probably will grow
slowly in the near term, as moderate increases in equipment purchases seem
likely to be partially offset by lower spending for structures. With regard
to equipment, orders for nondefense capital goods (excluding aircraft)
advanced 1 percent (not an annual rate) in the first quarter, after
increasing 2-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter. The first-quarter gain

reflected increases for several categories of industrial machinery and for
office and computing equipment.
By contrast, indicators for nonresidential structures continue to paint
a bleak picture. Construction permits and contracts in the office sector
have collapsed since late 1989, and those in other sectors have been
trending down (chart). Regional disparities in construction contracts have
been substantial. Over the past year, construction contracts in New England

fell 47 percent reflecting declines in the office, other commercial, and
manufacturing sectors. In the South Central region, which includes Texas
and Oklahoma, office contracts declined moderately while other commercial
and manufacturing contracts dropped substantially. In contrast,
construction contracts were relatively strong in the Pacific Northwest. In
the North Central (Great Lakes) states, increased contracts for office
buildings were more than offset by declines in other commercial and

II-18
manufacturing contracts. These regional disparities in contracts are
broadly consistent with anecdotal reports about regional construction
activity.
In the drilling and mining sector, the indicators for construction are
mixed. The Baker-Hughes rig count rose in April to a level well above its
first-quarter average. However, activity could be damped in the period
ahead if the recent weakness in oil prices persists.
Relative to the near-term indicators, the most recent Commerce
Department survey of plant and equipment spending for 1990 points to
stronger growth. The survey, taken from January to early March,

indicates that firms expect to increase nominal outlays about 7-3/4 percent
in 1990, an upward revision of nearly 1-1/2 percentage points from the

II-19
survey taken in October and November of last year. The upward revision in
spending plans was widespread across industries.
Housing Markets
Housing construction slowed in March, likely reflecting increases in
mortgage rates during the first quarter as well as an apparent payback for
weather-related shifting of construction into January and February. Total
private housing starts fell 9 percent in March to a 1.32 million unit annual
rate.
After surging in January and February, starts of single-family homes
fell 12 percent in March to 1.02 million units. Moreover, starts are
unlikely to be maintained at even this pace, given increased financing costs
and the softening in sales that occurred for single-family houses in the
first quarter. Survey evidence also points to some weakening: Consumer
perceptions of homebuying conditions have deteriorated slightly, and
builders' assessments of new home sales have dropped (chart).
In the multifamily sector, starts remained abysmally low, at an annual
rate of 300,000 units in March; however, starts had surged in January, when
builders rushed to stockpile permits in advance of new HUD regulations. For
the first quarter as a whole, multifamily starts averaged 360,000 units,
unchanged from the slow fourth-quarter pace. The multifamily rental vacancy
rate rose to 9.3 percent in the first quarter, about the same level that
prevailed in 1989, suggesting that the excess rental stock remains a major
constraint on the profitability of investment in rental housing.
In addition to the demand-side effects on housing construction,
complaints continue to be heard from many homebuilders and financial
institutions that the availability of credit to finance construction

projects has been curtailed by more stringent thrift capital standards,
loan-to-one-borrower limits under FIRREA, and tightened examination
standards for commercial banks. A survey recently conducted by the Federal
Reserve Banks found evidence of generally tighter credit conditions for real
estate developers and some associated reduction in construction activity.
One aspect of this appears to be tougher bank lending standards, which were
attributed partly to pressure by bank examiners to make only very safe loans
of this type. However, despite the reports of restricted credit
availability, HUD estimates that total construction loan commitments in the
fourth quarter of 1989--the latest available data--were slightly above those
in the fourth quarter of 1988, so the extent to which total credit
availability has been curtailed is uncertain.
Federal Sector
The unified budget deficit was a record $53 billion in March, bringing
the deficit for the first half of the fiscal year to $151 billion, compared
with $128 billion in the first six months of FY1989. Outlays surged in
March to $118 billion, boosted by $6 billion of spending for deposit
insurance and the shift into March of $6 billion in military salary,
veterans benefits, and supplementary security income payments that normally
are made on April 1, which fell on a weekend. In addition, receipts were
held down by continued weakness in corporate tax payments and by low
personal tax collections, the latter reflecting both high refunds and low
withholdings.
Final payments on personal income tax liabilities for the previous
year, as well as the first quarterly estimated tax payment for the current
year, are recorded primarily in April and early May. Daily Treasury reports

II-24
suggest that nonwithheld receipts this year may fall short of the record
$87 billion collected in April and May of 1989 by somewhere between $3 and
$6 billion.
The low level of nonwithheld taxes this year provides further
information on the sources of last year's big revenue surprise and on the
longer-run implications of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Indeed, the incoming
data suggest that temporary phenomena--such as increased capital gains
realizations or the incentive provided by the phased-in reduction in income
tax rates to shift income from 1987 into 1988--may have been more important
than had been thought previously in explaining the surge in receipts in
early 1989. If last year's surprise primarily had reflected a permanent
shift in tax liabilities--perhaps because of the base-broadening
provisions--revenues this year likely would have been higher as well.
Although other explanations, such as errors in the measurement of income,
cannot be ruled out, the staff has reduced its estimate of the permanent
component of last year's revenue surprise by $3 billion, lowering revenue
projections for 1991 and beyond, as well as for 1990.
The RTC has announced plans to spend as much as $50 billion in the
second quarter in order to sell or liquidate up to 140 financial
institutions. The brief history of the RTC suggests that it will fall short
of that goal, and the Daily Treasury Statements for April and early May show
only $5 billion in outlays. In any event, much of the RTC spending is
expected to be for working capital needs financed by loans from the Federal
Financing Bank (FFB). The unified budget scores such borrowing as an outlay
when the money is disbursed and treats repayment of the loan as an
offsetting receipt (negative outlay). The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law also

II-25
scores the borrowing as an outlay, but its treatment of the repayment is
uncertain. In the January budget, the Administration indicated that
excluding RTC working capital from Gramm-Rudman-Hollings calculations would
be desirable.
In April, the House passed a budget resolution with $35 billion in cuts
for FY1991, including $12 billion in defense reductions and $19 billion in
new taxes. The Senate Budget Committee passed a $43 billion proposal that
contains $14 billion in new revenues and a $13 billion reduction in defense
spending. In addition to the $43 billion package, the Senate committee's
resolution includes an initiative aimed at collecting $11 billion in past-
due taxes through stepped-up IRS enforcement and a temporary waiver of
penalties.
According to BEA's advance estimate, real purchases of goods and
services (excluding CCC outlays) rose 3 percent at an annual rate in the
first quarter, mainly because of a jump in outlays for NASA. Defense
spending was little changed, but is likely to decline in coming quarters in
light of the steady reduction of real spending authority since FY1985.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
rose at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter, about matching the
average advance over the last three years. Much of the growth in the first
quarter was in construction. Meanwhile, the fiscal condition of the sector
apparently deteriorated further; the staff estimates that the deficit of
5. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings accounting generally excludes asset sales that
are not part of a regular ongoing (revolving) credit program.

* For operating and capital accounts, excluding social insurance funds.

II-27
operating and capital accounts, excluding social insurance funds, grew to
$48 billion in the first quarter, the largest on record.
With the deficit for the sector as a whole so large, it is not
surprising that many states are wrestling with budgetary difficulties.
Indeed, in three-fourths of the states, general-funds expenditures are
expected to exceed revenues in fiscal 1990, which ends on June 30 for all
but four states. For about half the states, collections are below original
estimates. The shortfalls are in sharp contrast to the situation last
spring, when thirty-eight states reported revenues at or above estimates
made when budgets were enacted.
Much of the reduction in the pace of revenue growth reflects the
weakness in corporate profits tax accruals, which fell 21 percent over the
four quarters of calendar 1989. In contrast, property taxes--almost all of
which are collected by local governments--rose 7 percent, largely because
assessments caught up to earlier increases in property values. Some states
appear to have been encouraging local governments to levy higher property
taxes as their own financial woes have resulted in reduced aid to cities and
towns. Still, in a few states, the emphasis on property taxes has been
lessened by measures that facilitate the marketing of municipal debt or
allow the adoption of new taxing districts, such as for waste disposal.
Other steps have been bolder, such as in Maryland where a 10 percent cap on
increases in property assessments was adopted.
Prices
Consumer price inflation increased markedly in the first quarter.
Although weather-related jumps in prices of food and energy contributed to
the pickup, prices for a wide range of other goods and services also

accelerated. The CPI excluding food and energy increased at a 7-1/2 percent
annual rate in the first quarter--well above the 4 to 5 percent range that
has prevailed in this expansion. While a number of market-specific--and in
some instances transitory--factors were primarily responsible for the surge,
heightened cost pressures also played a role. Labor cost increases have
drifted upward, while the prices of imported consumer goods accelerated to a
7-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter.
Consumer food prices increased 0.3 percent in March, after jumping
2 percent in January and 1/2 percent in February. The moderation in March
largely reflected a sharp downturn in prices of fresh vegetables, which had
soared after the December cold snap. Additional declines in prices of fresh
vegetables seem likely in the nearterm as weekly prices of fresh vegetables
on wholesale markets moved down further in April to around pre-freeze
levels. Excluding fruits and vegetables, the food portion of the CPI rose
1/2 percent in March, led by another jump in prices of food away from home.
With the increase in the minimum wage in April, restaurants face further
labor cost pressures; indeed, the pickup in these prices in February and
March may have come partly in anticipation of higher wage bills. At the
farm level, planting of this year's spring crops is progressing at about its
normal pace nationally, although wet soil conditions have caused delays in
some states; about three-fourths of the winter wheat crop was rated in "good
to excellent" condition as of May 6, a sharp contrast to the poor condition
of the crop last year at this same time. Nonetheless, the spot and futures
prices of wheat and other major crops generally have moved higher, on net,
over the past two months, pressured by reports of continued strength in
exports.

Consumer energy prices fell another 3/4 percent in March as the price
of fuel oil dropped further and the price of gasoline turned down. Since
the end of March, the cost of crude oil has fallen sharply; the posted price
of West Texas Intermediate crude oil averaged $17.38 per barrel during the
first week in May, more than $2.50 less than in March. Survey data suggest
that the lower crude oil costs were not passed through to retail gasoline
prices in April, but are expected to be passed through to pump prices in
May.
Consumer prices for nonenergy services increased at a 7-1/4 percent
annual rate in the first quarter, reflecting price hikes for a broad range
of services. Continuing a pattern that was evident in 1989, increases in
rents and in the prices of medical services accounted for much of the rise
in nonenergy service prices (table). In addition, the cost of lodging while
out of town surged at close to a 25 percent annual rate after a double-digit
increase in the fourth quarter. Airfares also were up sharply, as a result
of adjustments to the general fare structure as well as temporary fuel
surcharges. Although the increases in airfares and the price of out-of-town
lodging were unusually large, they are not likely to be sustained. More
worrisome, however, was the substantial pickup in a wide variety of other
services prices. Many of these services--such as refuse collection, apparel
services, and home maintenance and repair--tend to be relatively labor
intensive, and prices probably are responding to higher labor costs.
Prices of consumer goods other than food and energy increased at a
7.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, well above the pace of 1989.
Higher prices for apparel accounted for most of the increase. The
substantial rise in apparel prices was related, in part, to improved BLS

techniques for measuring retail price changes and seasonal adjustment
difficulties associated with the new methodology. However, apparel prices
also accelerated in the first quarter at the producers' level, and trade
reports suggest that the firming of apparel prices was more than noise in
the data.
At the intermediate stage of processing, producer prices for materials
other than food and energy increased 0.3 percent in March, continuing to
edge up after declining slightly in the second half of 1989. Movements in
the prices of intermediate goods generally are passed through to the prices
of finished goods within a few months, and the leveling off of these prices
last year had helped to hold down the rate of increase in goods prices.
Producer prices of materials for durable manufacturing increased 0.7 percent
in March, reflecting the sharp pickup in spot prices of nonferrous metals.
More recently, spot prices of industrial metals have shown a mixed pattern,
as lead and copper prices have eased, while the prices of steel scrap have
moved up. The Journal of Commerce index for metals (upper panel of chart),
like the index total, has been little changed, on net, since March 20.
Labor Costs
As measured by the employment cost index (ECI), hourly compensation for
private industry workers rose 5.2 percent over the twelve months ended in
March--several tenths faster than in 1989. The pickup in compensation
occurred in benefits, which rose 7-1/4 percent over the year. One factor
was the hike in social security taxes in January, which the staff estimates
accounted for more than 1 percentage point of the twelve-month increase in
benefit costs, and about 1/4 percentage point of the twelve-month increase
in total compensation. But other benefits also rose rapidly. Health

insurance costs to employers continued to increase at a double-digit pace,
while lump-sum payments and bonuses accelerated. Meanwhile, the pace of
straight-time wage and salary inflation has remained fairly stable over the
past year at about 4-1/4 percent at an annual rate.
By industry, growth of hourly compensation in the goods-producing
sector picked up in the first quarter to about the same pace that has been
observed in the service-producing sector for more than a year. A relatively
greater acceleration of benefit costs accounted for the catch-up of the
goods-producing sector. In manufacturing, hourly compensation growth picked
up in both durable- and nondurable-goods industries despite widespread
employment declines. In the service-producing sector, an acceleration in
compensation in the services industry and in transportation and public
utilities offset decelerations in wholesale and retail trade, as well as in
finance, insurance, and real estate. The latter was held down by weak sales
commissions in the financial industry.
The acceleration in aggregate compensation per hour masked some shift
in the regional composition of pay performance. The economic slowdown in
the Northeast apparently held down compensation gains there. Although
increases in this region continue to be faster than elsewhere in the
country, they slowed 1 percentage point over the past year, to
5-3/4 percent. However, compensation in the other three regions of the
country accelerated 1 percentage point over the past year, reflecting the
tightening that occurred in most other regional labor markets.
In the union sector, hourly compensation rose 4-1/4 percent over the
past twelve months, up from 3 percent in the preceding year. Nonunion
compensation rose 5-1/2 percent over the same period, only 1/4 percentage

II-38
point more than over the year earlier. Stronger growth in union wages was
apparent in the first-quarter data on major collective bargaining
agreements--those covering 1,000 workers or more--which contained first-year
adjustments that were larger than in the agreements they replaced. Although
the small number of workers signing such contracts in the first quarter
limits the reliability of this comparison, these data, as well as the ECI,
show a continuing pattern of strengthening over the past year and a half.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have fallen
1 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter of 1990. However,
productivity in the manufacturing sector increased 4 percent at an annual
rate, well above last year's pace. Hourly compensation in the nonfarm
business sector rose about 4 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter,
and unit labor costs increased about 5 percent, similar to last year's
6pace.
Looking beyond the first quarter, average hourly earnings increased
0.3 percent in April. Although hourly earnings were up noticeably in a
number of sectors, overall hourly earnings were held down, in part, by a
6. Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector differs from the
employment cost index in several ways. Conceptually, the ECI is a fixed-
weight measure of compensation change for a particular set of jobs, while
hourly compensation is a measure of the average change in compensation
across all workers. Differences in how the data are measured and in the
sources from which the data are gathered also may induce a divergence
between the two series. The ECI is based directly on a rotating sample of
employers and reflects employers' responses to questions about compensation
rate changes for particular jobs. Hourly compensation is derived from the
data on total compensation paid estimated in the National Income and Product
Accounts coupled with estimates of aggregate employee hours from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. Although BEA's historical estimates of compensation
reflect extensive payroll information from unemployment insurance tax
records and corporate tax returns, data for the most recent years typically
are not based on a sample of firms but are estimated by BEA. As a result,
these data are subject to substantial revision.

II-39
sharp drop in construction employment, which lowered the overall nonfarm
average because construction is a relatively high wage industry. While
service wages soared, increases in the trade category did not pick up,
despite the rise in the minimum wage from $3.35 per hour to $3.80 per hour
that went into effect on April 1.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Since the March FOMC meeting, long-term market interest rates have
risen in response to evidence of continued moderate economic growth and
persistent inflation pressures. Late in the intermeeting period, release of
a weak employment report for April sparked a brief rally in the bond market,
but even with that improvement long-term market rates remain 25 to 35 basis
points above their levels of six weeks ago. At the very short end of the
market, rates have been anchored by the federal funds rate, which has stayed
in a narrow range around 8-1/4 percent. Other money market rates are mixed,
having been buffeted by changing views on the odds of a near-term tightening
of monetary policy.
The Treasury yield curve has become more steeply sloped, as
intermediate- and long-term yields have been boosted not only by incoming
data but also by an increase in issuance this quarter and rumors of foreign
unloading of government securities. Higher interest rates had damped stock
prices, but with the recent rally, most broad-based indexes have recovered
to just under their values at the time of the last FOMC meeting.
Growth in M2 slowed in April to a 3 percent annual rate, which brought
M2 growth so far this year down to a 5-3/4 percent pace, well within its 3
to 7 percent target range. The slowdown in M2 was due both to erratic
declines in demand deposits and overnight RPs and to the damping effect on
retail deposit growth of higher opportunity costs. M3 growth remained quite
sluggish in April, restrained by continued runoffs of large time deposits at
thrift institutions and commercial banks.

Bank credit rose at just a 4 percent rate in April, less than half the
pace of the two previous months. Growth of each of the major categories of
bank loans slowed, and overall credit in New England was notably weak. To
the extent that there is a credit crunch today, it appears to be
concentrated in New England, where construction firms and small businesses
generally may face tightened credit availability as bankers have responded
to deteriorating economic conditions, supervisory pressure, and loan losses.
The availability of credit for construction and land development has
tightened in other locales as well, but there are few indications of a
general stringency of business credit. For larger firms, the commercial
paper market has remained an important credit source; the junk bond market
has dried up, but a moderate amount of investment-grade bonds has been
issued despite rising bond yields.
Federal credit needs this quarter are especially uncertain, because of
the wide range of possible RTC borrowing; at this point, it seems likely
that the budget will show a small surplus. State and local governments
reduced their borrowing in April, responding to higher interest rates with a
significant drop in refunding issuance. Mortgage rates have moved up with
bond yields since the last FOMC meeting, likely restraining home mortgage
growth. Indications are that consumer credit growth also is ebbing:
Installment credit expansion slowed in the first quarter, and commercial
bank lending to consumers moderated in April.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 grew at an annual rate of 3 percent in April, somewhat more slowly
than in March, as investors responded to the widening of opportunity costs
on money assets in recent months. M1 growth slowed to 4 percent in April,

with continued hardy growth in currency and other checkable deposits partly
offset by a runoff in demand deposits.
The nontransactions component of M2 continued to slow in April, growing
at a 3 percent rate after a 6-3/4 percent pace in the first quarter.
Deposit rates have lagged movements in market interest rates, making M2
deposits less attractive as rates have risen. For example, the one-year
Treasury rate has increased about 3/4 percentage point since December, while
the average rates on one-year small time deposits available from banks and
thrifts have increased only a little (see chart). In response to this
differential in rates, retail investors have returned to the Treasury
auctions. Noncompetitive tenders at bill and note auctions totaled $3.1
billion in April, the highest monthly level in a year, and have remained
robust into May. About half of the April total was placed in two-year
notes, and, in the first phase of the mid-quarter refunding, the three-year
note received a record volume of noncompetitive tenders, perhaps reflecting
a lengthening of maturities to take advantage of the upward tilt of the
yield curve.
M3 growth remained subdued last month, at an annual rate of only 2
percent. Judging from the thrift industry's outflow of deposits and
runoff of managed liabilities, total thrift assets appear to have declined
markedly again last month. Commercial banks also ran off managed
1. Deposits denominated in foreign currencies, which are netted out of the
monetary aggregates, changed little in April. Such deposits amounted to $74
million in M1, $74 million in non-M1 M2, and $1.6 billion in non-M2 M3.
(Gross foreign currency deposits, which include interbank deposits, total
$2.0 billion.) The bulk of these deposits were in place before their formal
authorization by the Board, effective at the beginning of 1990, and their
slow expansion and small quantity have precluded their having noticeable
effects on the growth rates of the monetary aggregates.

liabilities in April, but their strong inflows of retail deposits, along
with a rise in Treasury balances, supported bank credit growth of about
4 percent.
This expansion in bank credit, however, marked a sharp deceleration
from the roughly 9 percent pace of the preceding two months. The growth
rate of total loans fell to 3 percent, with the slowdown spread widely
across the major components of bank lending. Business loan growth slackened
to a 6 percent rate as identifiable merger-related lending again was
negligible. Because of some large securitizations of credit-card
receivables, consumer loans on the books of commercial banks dropped at a
4 percent rate in April. Even after adjusting for these loan sales,
however, consumer loan growth was subdued, at about a 4 percent rate. The
growth of real estate loans, which typically had been in the double-digit
range for the past several years, eased to 7 percent in April. Much of the
weakness in bank credit, especially that in real estate loans, was
concentrated in New England, where a softening local economy and pressures
on bank capital positions appear to have combined to restrain lending.
Call report data indicate that, in general, banks with low capital-
asset ratios have tended to exhibit low credit growth. As the table shows,
when all domestically chartered banks are ranked by ratios of equity capital
to total assets, those banks in the bottom quartile expanded their loans
last year at about one-third the pace of those in the top quartile. Large
banks dominate the low-capital group, so that banks within the bottom 25
percent in terms of equity-asset ratios control 72 percent of all bank
assets. Relative to the country as a whole, New England had a
disproportionate number of banks that were thinly capitalized in 1989,

III-8
controlling about 90 percent of bank assets in that region. Their efforts
to improve those capital ratios in 1990 by tightening lending standards,
along with a surge in loan write-offs, account for some of the overall
slowdown in loan expansion.

Reports have surfaced in recent months suggesting that many small
businesses have encountered new problems in obtaining credit from their
traditional sources. According to preliminary results from the May Senior
Loan Officer Opinion Survey, many banks, particularly large regional banks,
have tightened somewhat their credit standards for lending to middle market
firms and small businesses since late last year. The primary reason given

III-9
for tightening was a less favorable economic outlook, although a
deterioration in the quality of banks' loan portfolios and regulatory
pressures were also mentioned. Respondents to the National Federation of
Independent Business survey, however, did not indicate that the difficulty
of obtaining loans has increased substantially in the last several months
except in New England.
Business Finance: Nonfinancial Sector
While the extension of bank credit to nonfinancial businesses slowed in
April, these firms continued to issue commercial paper at a rapid clip,
causing the sum of business loans and nonfinancial commercial paper again to
expand at a double-digit pace. With merger-related activity dropping off
sharply last month, this pattern reflected a pickup in borrowing for reasons
other than financial restructuring.
The issuance of publicly placed bonds by nonfinancial firms increased
somewhat in April. Investment-grade industrial firms accounted for the
step-up. Virtually no junk bonds were issued again last month; quoted
yields on junk bonds have declined relative to Treasury yields perhaps 50
basis points since the beginning of March, but the spreads remain very wide.
The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved Rule 144A,
which is expected to enhance secondary market liquidity of privately placed
securities and in time to result in even greater issuance in the private
market. In recent years, more than half of new U.S. nonfinancial bond
issues have been privately placed. The rule generally allows institutional
investors holding at least $100 million of securities to trade private
placements freely among themselves. Previously, all investors were required
to hold the securities for two years. Foreign companies in particular are

expected to find the 144A market attractive, as they will be able to issue
securities in a potentially liquid market without the disclosure
requirements of the public market, which have proved a significant deterrent
to their issuance in the past.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms in April was just over $1
billion, in line with the average of the last two years. Most major U.S.
stock indexes are down slightly since the last FOMC meeting, and broad-based
indexes now stand about 7 percent below their record highs of last fall.
National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) data indicate that profits of
nonfinancial corporations declined more than 17 percent over the course of
1989. The weakness in earnings has been reflected in the number of
corporations reducing or omitting dividend payments, which over the past two
quarters has reached levels not seen since 1986. Total dividends paid by
nonfinancial corporations fell more than 10 percent in the fourth quarter.
Even so, the reduction in dividends has lagged the decline in profits, and
dividend-payout ratios remained high by comparison with levels during the
last six years.
Business Finance: Financial Sector
Prices of financial stocks have fallen relative to broader stock
indexes so far this year, with banks, thrifts, and securities firms showing
the greatest weakness, in response to poor earnings reports. Aggregate NIPA
profits of private financial corporations fell sharply in 1989, registering
a net loss in the fourth quarter for the first time since 1984. The effects
of Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake on the profits of property
and casualty insurance companies accounted for part of the financial

III-12
sector's decline. But profits in the banking and thrift industries also
were down sharply.
On a financial accounting basis, the thrift industry experienced a
record $19.2 billion loss in 1989; the loss largely reflected loan-loss
provisions and losses on the sale of assets, but net operating income also
was negative for the first time since 1982. Thrifts in RTC conservatorship
accounted for 70 percent of the industry's losses last year. The
performance of other thrifts, including many insolvent and capital-impaired
institutions that likely will require intervention, deteriorated last year.
One bright spot in the fourth-quarter report was the earnings of the
adequately capitalized segment of the industry: These institutions posted
profits amounting to 0.4 percent of assets, and their net interest margins
improved 17 basis points.
Large loss provisions also depressed 1989 earnings at commercial banks.
Additions to loan-loss reserves were concentrated at multinational banks,
which posted a loss for the year as they reduced and restructured their
exposure to heavily indebted developing countries. Reserves against real
estate loans also were boosted by the industry. The performance of
agricultural loans, by contrast, continued to improve, contributing to a
strengthening of small banks' profitability last year.
Financial institutions reduced their borrowing in the commercial paper
market last month. Bank-related commercial paper declined again in April,
and net issuance by other financial firms turned sharply negative. With
profits under pressure and with investors increasingly concerned about
credit quality, financial companies reportedly are finding it more difficult
to get favorable rates in a market leery of the industry's health.

III-13
Bond ratings also have declined for the financial sector, as continued
weakening in real estate markets in the Northeast and Florida has caused a
further deterioration in the asset quality of banks in these regions.
Moody's downgradings of corporations exceeded its upgradings about 2-1/2 to
1 for both financial and nonfinancial firms in 1989. In the first quarter
of this year, however, the ratio has increased to more than 7 to 1 for
financial firms and to 3 to 1 for nonfinancial firms.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that the federal budget will show a small surplus
over the second quarter, compared with the $80 billion deficit registered in
the first quarter. Funding needs of the RTC are expected to increase
Treasury outlays by roughly $20 billion this quarter. Substantial
uncertainty surrounds the extent to which the RTC will draw upon its $43
billion second-quarter credit line from the Treasury, and this translates
into uncertainty about the Treasury's near-term cash needs. Until this
quarter, the pace of resolutions was slow, but has picked up more recently.
The RTC has drawn about $3-1/2 billion thus far in the second quarter. FDIC
Chairman Seidman reportedly still intends to resolve 141 thrifts (with
assets on the order of $50 billion) by the end of the quarter.
The staff anticipates that the Treasury will borrow about $23 billion
in the market during the second quarter, down from $51 billion last quarter;
most of the drop is accounted for by the $25 billion paydown of cash
management bills in April. Instead of the usual seasonal pattern of
reductions in the weekly bill auctions in the second quarter of each year,
the sizes of those auctions have been raised from $16 billion at the
beginning of April to $16.8 billion most recently to help fund the RTC's

cash needs. The sizes of the two- and three-year note auctions also were
increased, and the staff anticipates increases of about $250 million on
average for other coupon auctions during the remainder of the quarter.
Should RTC funding needs come in higher than the staff expects, a cash
management bill also is likely.
By early May, the RTC had completed 80 resolutions, including 28 during
the second quarter. The 80 transactions to date involved assets with a book
value of $21 billion and liabilities of $29 billion, based on the most
recent data. The RTC estimates that these resolutions will cost $11
billion. Since last fall, larger thrifts have been resolved and more
transactions have been purchase and assumptions, rather than deposit
transfers; nevertheless, few resolutions have involved a substantial sale of
assets. Because of the general lack of interest in the assets on its books,
the RTC recently decided to accept lower bids for properties that remain
2unsold. As of May 8, 338 thrifts remained in conservatorship, and the
book values of their assets and liabilities were $171 billion and $194
billion respectively.
Last month, REFCORP sold $3.5 billion of 40-year bonds to help finance
the capital requirements of the RTC, bringing total REFCORP debt outstanding
to $13 billion. The spread of the average auction rate over the 30-year
Treasury bond was 35 basis points, somewhat wider than the 28 basis point
spread of the previous $5 billion REFCORP auction of 40-year bonds in
2. FIRREA requires that the RTC sell thrift assets for no less than
95 percent of market value, which RTC had considered to be the average of
two appraisals. However, the slow pace of sales suggested that average
appraised values are often higher than market values. Thus, the RTC has
decided to accept bids 15 percent lower for properties that remain unsold
for six months, with an additional 5 percent reduction after nine months.

III-16
January. Since the April auction, the spread on the new bond has narrowed
to just under 30 basis points as retail and stripping demands have picked
up.
In light of the continuing decline in demand for advances, the Federal
Home Loan Banks, for the first time in a decade, chose not to sell any debt
at the regular monthly refinancing in May, running off about $3.5 billion in
obligations. Preliminary figures for the first quarter show that the FHLBs
paid down debt of $4.6 billion, while outstanding advances to their members
declined more than $9 billion (not seasonally adjusted). The reduced demand
for advances has contributed to a significant decline in FHLB earnings since
the third quarter of last year. Coupled with the financial obligations
associated with the thrift bailout, the earnings falloff has caused the
Banks to cut dividend payouts to member institutions. To boost earnings,
some Banks have begun purchasing modest amounts of mortgage-backed
securities, and the Dallas bank has asked the Federal Housing Finance Board
for permission to participate in residential and construction loans
originated by member institutions.
Total agency debt outstanding (including REFCORP debt) increased only
$1.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with an average quarterly
increase of almost $9 billion over the previous three years. This slowdown
in issuance has contributed to a general narrowing of the rate spreads
between agency and Treasury debt.
Municipal Securities
Yields on municipal bonds have risen about 25 basis points since the
last FOMC meeting, slowing refunding issuance in April to a crawl. Less
affected was gross long-term issuance for new capital, which was down only

III-17
slightly from March's level. At some point in the near future, additional
bond issuance should result from New York State's recent decision--in
response to a downgrading of its debt in March--to refinance outstanding
short-term notes with long-term bonds and to limit future issuance of short-

Mortgage Markets
Over the intermeeting period, contract interest rates on conventional
fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) have risen 41 basis points to 10.67 percent, the
highest level since May 1989, while the average commitment rate on
adjustable-rate mortgages is up only slightly. As a result of the rise in
FRM rates, the initial rate spread now favors ARMs by 2 percentage points

and is likely to prompt an increase in the ARM share of new mortgage
originations.
Available data on mortgage lending so far in 1990 suggest that net
mortgage debt growth may have begun to slow a bit. The underlying trend of
real estate loan growth at commercial banks may be easing down from the
double-digit pace of the past few years, and based on a broad measure of
thrift funding sources it appears that thrift institutions have continued to
sell off mortgage assets. (Thrift balance sheet data for January are not
available yet.)
With fixed-rate loans accounting for roughly three-quarters of new
conventional mortgages in recent months, issuance of federally related
fixed-rate pass-through securities has been robust. Despite the high rate
of issuance and the reduced demands by thrifts, yield spreads between pass-
throughs and Treasuries have been somewhat narrower in recent months.
Demand for the securities by investors such as commercial banks, insurance
companies, and pension funds has been sufficient to absorb a relatively
sizable volume of new issues, and record CMO issuance has contributed to the
demand for pass-throughs as collateral. In the first quarter, roughly 90
CMO offerings, worth over $32 billion, were brought to market.
CMO tranches with limited prepayment risk have been quite popular in
recent months and, according to trade reports, have attracted a number of
investors wishing to avoid the event risk and other problems associated with
corporate debt. Issuance of multiclass securities by private conduits has
picked up slightly, but, as in other recent quarters, the market for
derivatives in the first quarter was dominated by issues of FNMA and FHLMC.
FNMA and FHLMC issues now account for just over half of the $248 billion of

In other developments, FNMA continues to negotiate with thrift
institutions on an individual basis regarding releases from recourse
agreements on mortgage loans. Under risk-based capital guidelines, thrift
institutions must hold capital on mortgage loans sold with recourse as if
those loans remained entirely on their books. As a consequence, some
institutions reportedly have sought to obtain direct pool insurance and
special hazard insurance in lieu of recourse arrangements, especially for
third-party credit enhancements. The staff at FNMA states that less than 40
percent of its pass-throughs currently are backed by mortgages sold with
some measure of recourse, and that the proportion continues to decline.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 4-1/2 percent in March, following no change in February. The more rapid
growth in March was in revolving and auto loans. For the first quarter as a
whole, consumer credit rose at a 2-3/4 percent pace, off sharply from the
6-1/4 percent increase in the fourth quarter. (Data are confidential until
released Thursday, May 10.)
Data on consumer credit for the past several years have been revised to
incorporate additional information and revised seasonal factors. On an
annual basis, growth of installment credit was a bit stronger in 1987 and
1988 than previously reported, while growth in 1989 was about 1/2 percentage
point less.

Public issuance of consumer asset-backed securities remained strong in
the first quarter at $8.0 billion, second only to the $11.1 billion sold in
the final quarter of 1989 (see table). Almost two-thirds of first-quarter
securitizations were backed by credit cards, mainly those held by Citicorp
subsidiaries and by Sears (including the first public issuance backed by
Discover cards). Market participants expect the trend of accelerating
securitization to continue in response to risk-based capital requirements
and the falling costs of structuring deals. One negative in the market,
however, was the downgrading of two of Sears's earlier offerings from
triple-A to double-A by Fitch Investors Service. The issues were downgraded
because Sears retained the subordinated tranches in these two
senior/subordinated issues; Fitch's reaffirmed the triple-A ratings of other
Sears issues in which Sears did not retain the subordinated tranches.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 phased out the deductibility of consumer
interest payments except on home mortgages, thereby spurring the development
of revolving home equity loans. At the end of 1989, revolving home equity
loans totaled $66 billion at banks and thrifts. As shown in the chart,
delinquency rates on revolving home equity loans have remained in a narrow
band around 3/4 percent, significantly lower than the rates for mortgages
and for revolving and closed-end consumer loans at commercial banks. These
data suggest that home equity loans are not, at present, a major source of
credit-quality problems.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade balance narrowed in February to a deficit
of $6.5 billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis), lower than any monthly
deficit recorded in 1989. The value of imports declined almost 8 percent
from January levels, while exports were essentially unchanged. Trade data
for March will be released on May 17.
While moderating significantly in February from the highs recorded in
January, the value of oil imported was still more than 10 percent above its
level in the fourth quarter of last year. The strength of oil imports is
estimated to have persisted through March. The January surge in imports of

The price of imported oil rose sharply in the first two months of this
year due to strong oil demand (brought about by the unusually cold December
weather) and supply disruptions in the centrally planned economies. Given
contract and delivery lags, and the recent behavior of spot prices, the
import price is estimated to have averaged a little less than $20 per barrel
during the first quarter. The more recent decline in spot prices of oil is
expected to result in a substantially lower average price of imported oil in
April and May. Concern about the April decline in spot prices led to a
meeting of all OPEC oil ministers in early May, at which OPEC members
announced an agreement to reduce current production levels through the end
of July. Oil spot and futures prices fell about 65 cents per barrel
following the announcement, mostly because of disappointment with the size
and country composition of the production cuts.
Non-oil imports on a balance of payments basis declined almost 3
percent in January/February on average from high values recorded in the
fourth quarter, and were lower than any quarter during 1989 (see the two

IV-3
tables below). The largest declines were registered in automotive imports
(particularly from Canada) and consumer goods. The decline in imports of
automotive products reflects in part the continuation of a downtrend that
began a year ago, as well as the reduction in U.S. automotive production
during January. In addition, small declines in imports of industrial
supplies and capital goods were registered in January/February. The fall in
the value of non-oil imports during January/February appears to have
resulted from a reduction in the quantity of goods imported, as prices
increased modestly during the first quarter. (Price developments for
imports and exports in the first quarter are discussed further below.)
Exports in January/February were about 1-1/2 percent above the fourth-
quarter average. The strike at Boeing from early October to late November

of last year disrupted shipments of aircraft, and reduced the rate of
exports substantially in the fourth quarter, compared with the strong third-
quarter pace. Aircraft exports rebounded during January/February to the
third-quarter level, as normal production resumed and backlogs in deliveries
were reduced sharply. Data for January/February appear to indicate that the
rebound in aircraft exports was partially offset by declines in automotive
exports (especially to Canada because of reduced U.S. production) and other
nonagricultural products. Changes in the definitions of disaggregated data,
beginning in January, make it difficult to assess changes in exports across
trade categories between the fourth quarter and January/February. The
figures shown in the tables above have been adjusted in an effort to make
the data for January/February comparable to earlier quarters. At a future
date, revisions to the pre-1990 data will be available from the Department
of Commerce.
Import and Export Prices
As measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, import prices increased
4.9 percent on average at an annual rate in the first quarter, reflecting
increases in both oil and non-oil products. Prices of non-oil imports
accelerated somewhat over the first three months of this year, owing in part
to the depreciation of the dollar against G-10 currencies other than the yen
that has occurred since mid-1989. Food prices were up sharply in the first
quarter, reflecting volatility in prices of meats, fruits, and vegetables.
Strong increases were also recorded for prices of imported capital goods and
consumer goods.
The increase in prices of imported consumer goods in the first quarter
included a 4-1/2 percent (AR) increase in the price of apparel; within the

apparel category, there was a sharp increase in the average price of
imported footwear and a less than 1/2 percent (AR) increase in the average
price of imported clothing. Recently, the Department of Commerce ruled that
South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have been dumping sweaters in the U.S.
market. (Because of this finding, duties will be levied on sweater imports
from these countries.) It has been suggested that the threat of a dumping
ruling may have led suppliers from these countries to push up prices over
the past several months. However, sweaters from these countries are only a
small fraction of total textile and apparel imports ($1.2 billion out of $21
billion in 1989).
Prices of exports increased slightly in the first quarter, following a
year of flat to negative growth. Agricultural prices were down somewhat,
largely due to a decline in the price of wheat. Prices of nonagricultural
products rose 2.4 percent (AR) on average in the first quarter, compared
with a 0.4 percent average increase in the fourth quarter of last year, led
by increases in the prices of exported consumer and capital goods. The
increased inflation for these categories appears to be related to an
acceleration in domestic prices for consumer and capital goods that began in
the fourth quarter of last year.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
The capital inflows that are the counterpart to continuing U.S.
current account deficits are not apparent in the data available to date in
1990. (See the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.) While
banks reported substantial inflows, they were almost matched by reductions
in official reserves and outflows resulting from private securities
transactions.

Foreign official reserve assets in the United States (line 4) declined
by $8-1/2 billion in the first quarter of 1990. In addition to declines in
holdings of the G-10 countries to finance intervention sales of dollars,
there were substantial declines reported for the Asian NIEs. These declines
for the NIEs probably reflected a combination of lower reserves and shifts
in their currency composition. In contrast, OPEC reserves in the United
States increased. Mexican official reserves in the United States rose about
$3 billion as Mexico acquired special-issue U.S. Treasury bonds as part of a
debt restructuring package.
Private securities transactions also produced net outflows in the
first quarter. Large net sales of U.S. Treasury securities by private
foreigners (line 3) in March more than reversed net purchases in the first
two months of 1990. Japanese residents alone accounted for $3.7 billion in
net sales in March. The United Kingdom and Japan accounted for most of the
net purchases in January and February.
Net purchases of U.S. corporate and government agency securities by
private foreigners (line 2a) were about $6 billion in the first quarter.
Government agency securities accounted for almost half the total, with
Eurobonds issued by U.S. corporations accounting for most of the remainder.
Despite a pick up in domestic bond issuance in March and April, Eurobond
issuance by U.S. corporations remained depressed.
Net sales of U.S. stocks by foreigners (line 2b) amounted to $3
billion in the first quarter; net sales were particularly heavy in March.
Residents of Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Japan were the major
sellers during the quarter. Foreigners have not added net to their holdings
of U.S. stocks since October 1989.

IV-10
Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities (line 2c) were almost $3
billion in the first quarter. About half the total was accounted for by a
new issue by the World Bank.
Capital flows reported by banks continued to be very volatile on a
month-end basis (line 1). Very large capital inflows reported in March
brought the total inflow for the first quarter to $14 billion. On a monthly
average basis (line 1 of the International Banking Data table on next page),
banks also reported substantial inflows from their own foreign offices and
IBFs in the first three months of 1990. Credit extended to U.S. nonbank
residents from foreign branches of U.S. banks (line 2) increased somewhat
between December and March. There was more rapid growth (about $4 billion)
in credit extended from the foreign branches of foreign-based banks between
the end of December and the end of March (not shown on the table).
U.S. nonbanks' Eurodollar deposits (line 3) continued to decline in
the first quarter of 1990, cumulating to a decline of over $30 billion since
December 1988. Overnight Eurodollar deposits fluctuated over this period,
but have shown little trend; term deposits accounted for the decline.
During 1989 the decreases were spread among time deposits at both U.K. and
offshore offices and in CDs held in custody in London. In the first quarter
of 1990 the decline was concentrated in CDs.
Since the end of 1988 the differential between 3-month Eurodollar
rates and domestic rates (both CD and Treasury bill rates) has trended down,
reducing the incentive for U.S. residents to place funds in the Euromarkets.
BIS data, covering 1989, indicate no decline in the funds raised by banks in
the Euromarkets. Apparently other depositors have replaced U.S. residents.

just the liabilities of the foreign branches of U.S. banks, suggest that
this pattern has persisted into 1990.
U.S. nonbanks' deposits outside the United States are inadequately
covered in the Treasury International Capital (TIC) reports that provide the
basis for the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table. The TIC
reports indicate virtually no decline in these deposits in 1989.
Consequently, the large decline in U.S. residents' Eurodollar deposits in
1989 (an omitted inflow in the balance of payments accounts) contributed
significantly to the positive statistical discrepancy (line 10).
Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against the
other G-10 currencies has declined about 2-3/4 percent, overall, since the
March FOMC meeting, as shown in the accompanying chart. Much of the
dollar's decline followed the release in early May of weaker-than-expected
U.S. payroll employment figures for April. The dollar's weakening has
occurred despite a widening of nominal interest rate differentials in favor
of U.S. assets. The dollar has depreciated about 3-3/4 percent against the
mark and the French franc, and about 3 percent against sterling, while it
has declined somewhat less against the yen, about 1-1/2 percent.
The mark strengthened somewhat following the announcement in early May
that Germany's leading union, IG Metall, agreed to a 6 percent wage increase
and a phased reduction to the 35-hour workweek it had sought for several
years. The mark may also have been supported by a resolution of some of the
uncertainty regarding monetary union and by increasing confidence in the
Bundesbank's commitment to a strong mark and to countering the inflationary
pressures that might arise from monetary union. However, the mark remains

near the bottom of the EMS currency band despite decreases in the official
interest rates of its EMS partners.
The Bank of France decreased its money market intervention rate
25 basis points as its currency continued to strengthen against the mark.
This has contributed to further declines in French money market rates which
have moved down more than 100 basis points since early this year. French
long-term rates have declined about 30 basis points.

has decreased its money market intervention rate 20 basis points, and the
central banks of Denmark and Belgium have decreased key lending rates, by 50
basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. In Italy, money market
rates have declined considerably, about 100 basis points, but Italian long-
term rates have changed little since the March FOMC meeting.
The yen and Japanese stock prices have been relatively stable since
the G-7 meeting in the early part of the intermeeting period.

it provided little support for the yen. In its only

Sterling has recovered somewhat from the lows reached late in the
previous intermeeting period. Dissatisfaction with the Conservative Party's
government has been widespread, as evidenced in recent U.K. local elections,

but not as overwhelming as might have been expected. The violent poll tax
protests have abated, as have the rumors of Prime Minister Thatcher's
imminent resignation.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data from the first quarter point to a divergence in the pace of
activity in the foreign industrial economies. Moderate growth in real
economic activity continued in Japan, Germany, and France. Construction and
investment were particularly strong in Germany. A trend toward slower
economic growth, marked by declines in industrial production, is evident in
the United Kingdom, Canada, and, to a lesser extent, Italy.
Except in the United Kingdom, measures of inflation appear to have
stabilized or eased in the first quarter. However, lower measured inflation
in Japan and Germany may mask continued inflationary pressure. While
passing of 1989 tax-effects from the CPI has reduced measured inflation in
Japan, the underlying rate of price increase has yet to reflect fully
earlier depreciation of the yen. Appreciation of the DM relative to the
dollar since January has held down import and wholesale prices in Germany,
although there are indications that consumer price inflation may increase.
Inflation rates in Canada and Italy have fallen.
Changes in external imbalances among the foreign economies have been
mixed in recent months. The current account surplus in Japan and Germany
widened in the first quarter. Growth in imports has led to deterioration of
trade balances in the United Kingdom and Canada, while France's trade
deficit narrowed in the first quarter.

rebounded in March with a 2.6 percent increase from February's sluggish
performance. In the first quarter, industrial production has increased at
an average annual rate of about 4 percent, somewhat less than last year's
average rate of 6 percent. Construction orders surged in March to a level
more than 40 percent above March last year, but housing starts declined 2
percent from a year ago (after six consecutive months of increases).
Although the job-offers-to-applicants ratio declined 1.5 percent in March,
suggesting somewhat greater slack ahead in labor markets, the unemployment
rate (s.a.) edged down slightly to 2.0 percent, the lowest rate recorded
since 1980.
The measured rate of consumer price inflation declined in April to 2.7
percent (n.s.a., year-over-year basis) from first-quarter rates that
averaged more than 3-1/2 percent. Much of the apparent decline is
attributable to removal of effects on this measure of value-added taxes
introduced in April last year. During the three months ending in April
1990, consumer prices increased at an annual rate of almost 4 percent from
their average level in the previous three months. Wholesale prices moved up
0.7 percent (n.s.a.) in March, the largest increase since June last year,
leaving the index 3.9 percent above its level of a year ago. The large
increase was attributed in part to weakness of the yen; the index of import
prices advanced nearly 4 percent in March and was 14 percent above its year-
earlier level.
The current account surplus widened by $2.0 billion in March, after
rising $2.2 billion in February, to stand at $15.4 billion in the first
quarter. About half of the increase was due to a larger trade surplus; much
of the widening was accounted for by a $1.3 billion improvement in the

IV-20
deficit on invisible transactions arising in large part from growing
investment income.
In early April, Japanese and U.S. authorities issued an interim report
on areas of tentative agreement in the bilateral Structural Impediments
Initiative trade negotiations. In the report, Japan indicated that it had
agreed to adopt a 10-year plan designed to increase public sector investment
on domestic infrastructure, that it would modify its Large Scale Retail
Store Law to facilitate approval of new stores, and that it would adopt
legislation to increase the supply of housing and residential land. In
April, U.S. and Japanese authorities also announced agreements on opening
Japanese markets to trade in satellites and wood products.
Economic activity in Germany has remained strong in recent months.
Industrial production (s.a.) rose 2.4 percent above a year ago in the first
quarter, increasing sharply in December and January, but falling back
slightly in February and March. Construction has been the most robust
sector so far this year owing to a combination of strong demand and mild
weather. In January and February, construction activity (s.a.) was 24
percent higher than in December and November, and it was 2.3 percent above
the record level achieved in the same period in 1989. The volume of new
orders increased 2.9 percent (s.a.) in March from February. For the three
months ending in March, foreign orders rose 0.6 percent over the preceding
three months, while domestic orders fell 0.7 percent over the same period.
The unemployment rate (s.a.) declined from 7.4 percent in February to
7.3 percent in April. These figures are indicative of strong growth of
labor demand in recent months, but they do not fully reflect the continuing
influx of immigrants from East Europe. Immigrants arriving after the

IV-21
beginning of the year are not eligible for unemployment benefits for two
months and consequently are not included in measured unemployment for that
period. The rate of migration from East to West Germany has slowed from
1,700 per day in the week prior to the East German election on March 18, to
475 per day in the second week in April. Over 163,000 immigrants from East
Germany have arrived in the FRG since the beginning of the year. In early
May, the IG Metall union announced a new agreement that calls for a
reduction in the workweek from 37 to 35 hours between April 1993 and October
1995. Wages covered by the contract will rise by 6 percent in the year
starting in July, but it is estimated that the effective increase will be
closer to 7 to 7-1/2 percent when additional special payments are added.
On a 12-month basis, consumer price inflation (n.s.a.) has declined
from 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989 to 2.7 percent in the first
quarter of 1990. This decline in measured inflation occurred in part
because the excise-tax increases that raised consumer prices in January 1989
(by about 0.7 percent) were not reflected in 12-month measures of CPI
inflation after December 1989. Seasonally adjusted consumer prices
increased 0.3 percent in both February and March, compared with monthly
increases of 0.2 percent from November to January. Producer prices were
virtually unchanged between October and March, while wholesale prices
(n.s.a.) stood only 0.6 percent above their year-earlier level in both
February and March. Import prices increased 0.2 percent in March, the first
increase since September, but were still 2.8 percent below their year-
earlier level because of the strength of the DM against the dollar in recent
months.

IV-22
Germany's current account (n.s.a.) surplus increased sharply in the
first quarter to $17.2 billion from $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter.
For the first two months of the year the trade surplus when measured in DM
is virtually unchanged from the same period in 1989, but is up 10 percent in
dollar terms.
Economic policy has been dominated in recent months by developments in
East Germany. On May 2 the East and West German governments reached
agreement on the basic terms for monetary union. Most East German residents
will be allowed to convert up to 4,000 Ostmarks into DM at a rate of 1:1,
and the remainder of their holdings will be converted at a rate of 2:1.
East Germans over 60 will be allowed to convert up to 6,000 Ostmarks at 1:1
while those under 14 will only be allowed to convert 2,000 Ostmarks at the
preferential rate. This conversion is expected to create a new stock of DM
assets equal to about 13 percent of West German M3. Wages and pensions will
be converted at a rate of 1:1. In conjunction with agreement on the
monetary aspects of the conversion, the East German government is expected
to implement the following reforms before economic and monetary union is
established on July 2: extend the West German banking act to East Germany,
eliminate restrictions on private enterprises, significantly reduce
restrictions on foreign investment, eliminate subsidies on most consumer
goods, and adopt a modified version of the West German tax system.
While recent data on economic activity in France have been mixed, the
underlying prospects for growth still appear to be positive. Industrial
production has increased slowly in recent months, in part due to current
high levels of capacity utilization. Although industrial production (s.a.)
declined in February, on a 12-month basis, industrial production was up 2.7

IV-23
percent in January and 1.1 percent in February; much of the weakness in
February was due to weather-related factors. Household consumption of
manufactured goods (s.a.) was up 5.0 percent on a 12-month basis in
February, although it only grew 0.2 percent between January and February.
Investment spending is expected to continue its recent strong pace. Real
private corporate investment is projected to increase 11 percent this year,
up from a 7.5 percent increase last year according to a government survey
released in March. Movement in France's trade deficit has been slight, as
the first-quarter trade deficit (s.a.) was $410 million compared with $551
million a year ago.
French inflation has been moderate, but there are signs of continued
pressure. The CPI (n.s.a.) rose 0.3 percent in March, up 3.4 percent on a
12-month basis. Wage pressures have begun to accelerate slightly; a survey
of wage agreements at the beginning of this year indicated that wages were
rising at a 3 percent annual rate, compared with 2.3 percent in the same
survey in 1989.
The latest available data for the United Kingdom suggest that weakness
in production has not been accompanied by reduced spending. Industrial
production (s.a.) fell for the fourth consecutive month in February to a
level only 0.3 percent above a year ago. In March, manufacturers' order
books were at their lowest level in three years and the volume of retail
sales (s.a.) fell to a level 0.2 percent above a year ago. However,
unemployment (s.a.) continued to fall in March to 5.6 percent. Imports
increased to a new high in March, setting the current account deficit at
$3.5 billion, the worst monthly figure since August 1989.

IV-24
Inflationary pressures remain a major problem in the United Kingdom.
Retail prices (s.a.) rose 1.0 percent in March to a level 8.1 percent above
a year ago. About half of the increase was accounted for by increases in
mortgage interest rates. The underlying rate of inflation, which excludes
mortgage interest payments, reached a peak of 6.3 percent. There is growing
concern that a wage-price spiral is developing. The rate of inflation is
expected to rise even further in coming months as increases in excise taxes,
poll taxes, and utility rates pass through into prices. In February, the
underlying annual rate of increase in average earnings rose to 9-1/2
percent. Recently all four U.K. power unions voted to strike for a higher
(than 8-1/2 percent) pay offer, and several well-publicized wage
negotiations have yielded double-digit raises.
New and revised GDP data for 1988 and 1989 in Italy indicate that
year-over-year growth slowed from the revised 4.2 percent pace in 1988 to
3.2 percent in 1989. By the fourth quarter of last year the increase in GDP
from its level a year earlier was only 2.8 percent. Deceleration was most
pronounced in consumption spending, while investment spending remained
strong throughout 1989 at 5.1 percent. Recent business survey data suggest
that investment will continue to show strength in 1990. Slower Italian
growth has been evident in industrial production (s.a.), which declined 1.2
percent in January from its fourth-quarter average.
Consumer, producer, and wholesale price inflation slowed this year.
In April the consumer price index (n.s.a.) was 5.8 percent above its level a
year earlier, down from 6.5 percent in December.
In a speech before parliament, Treasury Minister Guido Carli indicated
that the 1990 budget deficit will be larger than previously expected by 1.2

IV-25
percent of GDP. This is due almost entirely to higher interest payments,
public sector wages, and health expenditures. The government also announced
major changes in the social security system, including an increase in the
retirement age by five years, to contain social security expenditures, one
of the fastest growing components of central government expenditures.
Recent economic indicators from Canada continue to suggest slower
growth. Real GDP slowed in the fourth quarter, posting a 2.0 percent
(s.a.a.r.) increase. Industrial production (s.a.) declined 1.8 percent in
January and 0.3 percent in February. Retail sales (s.a.) fell 1.1 percent
in February. Business and personal bankruptcies have risen to their highest
level since the 1982 recession. Manufacturers' shipments (s.a.) rebounded
only 1.9 percent in February following a 4.7 percent decline in January.
The fall in unemployment (s.a.) to 7.2 percent in March from 7.7 percent the
previous month, attributed to an aberration in the distribution of
unemployment insurance, is not expected to continue.
Following a sharp increase in January due to higher winter fuel
prices, inflation in Canada appears to be moderating. The consumer price
index (n.s.a.) rose 0.3 percent in March to a year-over-year rate of 5.3
percent. The CPI excluding food and energy fell to 4.9 percent on a year-
over-year basis from 5.8 percent last September.
Political uncertainty in Canada over the future of Quebec continues.
Quebec officials have discussed the possibility of seceding from Canada if
certain constitutional provisions are not ratified by a June 23 deadline.
While it appears unlikely that the deadline will be met, the Federal
government is hopeful that a compromise can soon be reached.

IV-26
Developments in East European Economies
Hungary's new government is taking shape following its first multi-
party election since 1945. Center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum leader
Jozsef Antall emerged as the head of a coalition government to be formed
with two smaller parties. The other major party, the liberal-social
Alliance of Free Democrats, supports more radical economic reforms.
In early April, Hungary received the first tranche of the ECU 870
million ($1 billion) loan arranged by the European Community.
Conditionality associated with this loan (which is expected to be disbursed
in three tranches of approximately equal amounts over three years) is tied
to the IMF stand-by (signed by Hungary in March) as well as to broader
measures of structural reforms. The EC Commission raised the funds for the
first tranche on commercial markets and on-lent to Hungary at the same
rates. The EC has encouraged non-EC G-24 governments to participate in the
second and third tranches of the loan.
Three months of the shock program instituted in January in Poland, a
program supported by the IMF and a multilateral Exchange Rate Stabilization
Fund, has brought a steep decline in production and rising unemployment
(about 3.2 percent of the labor force as of late-April). Inflation appears
to be coming under control, as monthly rates of increase have dropped from
79 percent in January, to 24 percent in February, to 5 percent in March.
The official exchange rate is holding its value in the parallel markets, and
Poland had a merchandise trade surplus of about $780 million in the first
quarter. In the March review of economic performance under the IMF stand-
by, Poland met all performance criteria (budget deficit, bank credit, wages,
international reserves, and international borrowing).

IV-27
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
Since Brazil's disinflation program began to be implemented in mid-
March, prices have remained stable, economic activity has fallen, and the
government has been running fiscal surpluses. But lasting fiscal progress
will require more permanent increases in revenues and/or more expenditure
cuts than have so far been instituted. On March 28, Mexico exchanged about
$42.8 billion of existing bank debt for 30-year bonds collateralized by
zero-coupon bonds and carrying a rolling guarantee of 18-months of interest.
Since then, domestic interest rates have eased. In Argentina, prices and
financial markets have stabilized substantially in the past two months, but
recent small Treasury surpluses result from a suppression of expenditures
that cannot long be sustained. Venezuela has taken new steps to liberalize
imports and free interest rates, but domestic fuel prices have not changed
in over a year and non-oil exports remain subsidized. The Philippines
missed some of the December performance criteria of its IMF program. Since
last December's abortive coup, the fiscal deficit has grown, monetary policy
has become more expansionary, and inflation has increased.
Individual country notes. Brazil's disinflation program was approved
by the Brazilian Congress with some modifications that President Collor
subsequently vetoed. Since mid-March, prices have remained stable, but
economic activity in the construction, automobile, and other durable goods
industries has fallen sharply. Unemployment appears to have risen only
slightly so far, as employers and workers in many cases have bargained to
maintain employment levels in exchange for a reduction in the wage bill.
Some increases in government expenditures have been authorized to dampen the
fall in demand and employment, but the government has been running surpluses

IV-28
since the plan was implemented. These surpluses have resulted mainly from
the one-time tax on financial wealth and from reduced interest payments on
local-currency debt. The reduced interest payments reflect the government's
decision to lower the interest rate that it pays on this debt and to defer
most payments on it until September 1991. However, revenues from the wealth
tax will decline sharply after this week. Thereafter, further tax increases
and/or expenditure cuts will be needed to avoid fiscal deficits.
Since mid-March, the currency has depreciated in real terms, but
remains overvalued. The overvaluation has led to a narrowing of the trade
surplus since last August. In addition, a widespread belief that a large
one-time real devaluation would occur in mid-March, when President Collor
took office, resulted in significant anticipatory importing.
An IMF staff mission is expected to visit Brazil in June to begin
consultations and possibly to start negotiating a new stand-by arrangement.
The government has stated that negotiations with commercial banks will await
an improvement in domestic conditions. Interest arrears to commercial banks
are about $5.4 billion.
On March 28, Mexico exchanged about $42.8 billion of existing bank
debt for 30-year bonds collateralized by zero-coupon bonds and carrying a
rolling guarantee of 18-months of interest. Of the new bonds, $22.5
billion, carrying a fixed 6.25 percent interest rate, were issued in
exchange for an equal amount of old debt, and $13.2 billion, carrying
interest at LIBOR plus 13/16 percent, were issued in exchange for $20.3
billion in old debt, i.e., at a 35 percent discount. Old bank debt with a
face value of $4.5 billion continues to be held by banks, and the holders
are committed to lend Mexico about $1.1 billion through 1992.

IV-29
On the same day, Mexico received short-term bridge financing of $1.3
billion from the Federal Reserve ($700 million) and the U.S. Treasury ($600
million) to deal with a cash flow problem. $750 million was disbursed in
cash and the rest was invested in Treasury certificates of indebtedness held
at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, subject to gradual redemption as
specified conditions are met. The bridge financing is to be repaid from
disbursements by the IMF and World Bank that should be available to Mexico
between April 1 and September 15, 1990. By May 1, Mexico had repaid about
$290 million and redeemed $150 million of the certificates of indebtedness.
On April 18, the IMF Executive Board granted Mexico a waiver of the
performance criteria for net international reserves and for the net domestic
assets of the Bank of Mexico as of the end of 1989, which Mexico had missed.
This enabled Mexico to draw about $215 million from the IMF under its EFF
arrangement and to initiate repayment of the bridge loan.
On May 2, President Salinas sent to the Mexican Congress a proposal to
return the nationalized commercial banks to private ownership. A
constitutional amendment, for which a two-thirds vote of approval by the
Congress is needed, will be required. On the news, the Mexico City stock
market index surged by 10 percent in four sessions.
Since mid-March, domestic interest rates have eased. The 28-day
Treasury bill rate was 42.6 percent on May 2, down 474 basis points from the
March 14 level. The CPI rose by 1.8 percent in March, when it was 24.5
percent above a year earlier.
Prices and financial markets in Argentina have largely stabilized in
the past two months. The austral value of the dollar, which rose from 1860
at the end of January to 5800 at the end of February, declined to 4700 by

IV-30
end-March and has been trading at about 5000 in recent days. Short-term
interest rates, which peaked at over 500 percent (monthly basis) at end-
February, have declined to between 10 and 20 percent. The CPI rose by 95.5
percent in March, but is likely to rise by only about 12 percent in April.
The stabilization of the macroeconomic situation largely reflects a
substantial reduction in monetary emission since February, made possible by
small Treasury cash surpluses. However, these surpluses have been based
upon very low wages for government employees, arrears to suppliers and
external creditors, and a curtailment of transfers to the financially
strapped provincial governments. Another surplus is expected in April, but,
thereafter, it may be difficult to continue suppressing expenditures.
Argentina missed its December 1989 targets under the IMF stand-by
arrangement approved in November 1989, and the program became inoperative.
A letter of intent for a modified program was completed in early April.
Subject to Argentina's success in keeping its stabilization program on track
and implementing additional fiscal measures, the modified program may be
submitted to the Executive Board for approval within the next few weeks.
Venezuela took new steps in March to liberalize trade and free
interest rates. The maximum tariff rate was cut from 80 to 50 percent, the
maximum interest rate allowed on domestic commercial bank loans was raised
from 34 to 60 percent, and the minimum deposit rate was lowered from 15 to
10 percent. Restrictions on agricultural imports are to be relaxed in June.
However, domestic fuel prices have not been raised since February 1989, even
though the Venezuelan price level has doubled since then. Fuel prices are
now only 15 to 25 percent of world market levels. The government reportedly
intends to boost them in June. In addition, a subsidy to non-oil exports

IV-31
has not been eliminated as required under a World Bank loan. It was reduced
in March from 30 to 15 percent of export value, and is to be abolished
within the next 12 months.
The public sector deficit narrowed to 1.1 percent of GDP in 1989 from
9.9 percent in 1988, helping to reduce monthly inflation to 1.8 percent in
March from a peak of 21.3 percent a year earlier, but contributing to an 8.1
percent decline in real GDP. The current account shifted to a surplus of
$2.3 billion in 1989 from a deficit of $4.7 billion in 1988, mainly because
of a 38 percent decline in imports.
The Philippines missed some of the December quantitative performance
criteria under its current IMF program, and a modification of the
arrangement is expected. Approval of a modified program will permit the
Philippines to make a third drawing against the May 1989 SDR 661 million
Extended Fund Facility.
Philippine monetary policy has become more expansionary since last
December's abortive coup, and inflation has increased to 13.4 percent in the
12 months ended in March 1990, compared with a 7.4 percent rate in the
previous 12 months. The fiscal deficit has grown significantly, leading to
larger Treasury bill offerings, which, in combination with the increasing
inflation, have caused interest rates to rise substantially, further
widening the deficit. Because the Philippine Congress failed to approve the
administration's request for an increase in certain excise taxes, the
administration is now planning to impose a 3 percent import surcharge. A
severe power shortage due in part to drought has forced the government to
institute a four-day work week for most workers in Manila.
