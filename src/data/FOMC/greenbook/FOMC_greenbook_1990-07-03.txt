created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
On the whole, indicators of economic activity point to slow growth in
the second quarter. Initial estimates of retail sales for May suggest a
marked weakening in demand for consumer goods, while construction activity
has slumped in the aftermath of the winter's weather-related bulge. All of
the growth in the current quarter is likely to be accounted for by a sharp
rebound in auto and truck production. Factory utilization rates have edged
back up, and the unemployment rate has remained near 5-1/4 percent. As
expected, inflation has retreated from its elevated first-quarter pace; even
so, year-over-year increases in wages and prices have remained in the upper
part of their recent ranges.
Employment and Unemployment
Employment growth has been relatively slow on average since February,
with hiring by the Census Bureau more than accounting for the gain. A
slackening in private employment growth was to be expected, given the
temporary boost provided in January and February by the warm weather, which
especially swelled construction payrolls. But the recent weakness suggests
a more fundamental softening in labor demand, likely arising from a lagged
adjustment of work forces to slower trends of output growth.
In May, private payrolls rose only 10,000, following a decrease of
126,000 in April (originally reported as a drop of 64,000). Employment in
manufacturing declined an additional 35,000 in May, bringing the cumulative
drop in the past year to almost 300,000. Construction employment also fell
in May; these payrolls are now below their level of last fall, consistent
with the weakness in some other measures of building activity. Gains in

services, which had been exceptionally strong earlier in the year, also have
slowed, most notably at firms providing business services; over the past
three months, employment in services has risen only 30,000 per month on
average, well below the 1989 average monthly gain of 100,000. In contrast,
government employment has posted large increases of late, mainly because of
the hiring of 325,000 Census workers. Although it is possible that, in the
absence of the Census, some of these workers might have taken private-sector
jobs, neither the patterns during past Censuses nor available information on
the characteristics of recent Census hires provides support for this
hypothesis.
The household measure of employment--like the payroll series--has
slowed considerably over the past year. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate,
which edged back down to 5.3 percent in May, has been essentially unchanged
for a year and a half. Since mid-1989, a rise in the number of workers who
lost jobs has been offset by a decline in the number of entrants and
reentrants to the labor force who had not yet found jobs.
Taking a longer perspective, labor force growth has slowed in the past
couple of years. In part, this slowing reflects factors that emerged
earlier in the 1980s and that are likely to persist. Notably, as the "baby
bust" generation has aged, the young working-age population (ages 16 to 24)
has begun to decline. According to projections by the Census Bureau, the
number of these young workers will continue to shrink well into the coming
decade, although at a progressively slower rate after 1991. Further, the
trend in overall labor force participation has been rising less rapidly:
The sharp increases in the labor force participation rates of women seen in
the 1970s and early 1980s have tapered off, and the participation rates of

adult men have continued to trend down in line with a decline in the average
age of retirement.
In recent quarters particularly, the labor force participation rate
appears to have flattened out. Although we cannot fully explain this, it is
possible that fewer individuals were attracted into the labor force as labor
demand slowed over the past year. The sharpest drop in labor force
participation rates occurred among women 20-24 years old.
Labor Cost Developments
Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose
0.4 percent in May, with large increases in construction and in
manufacturing. However, excluding overtime, average hourly earnings in
manufacturing were little changed in May, after increasing 0.8 percent in
April.
Wage effects of the April 1 increase in the minimum wage are not
discernible in the recent data. In particular, average hourly earnings in
retail trade increased just 0.1 percent in April and 0.3 percent in May.
And although hourly earnings in services did increase sharply in April, they
were flat in May; thus, the average increase over the two-month period was
not much different than the readings for the preceding few quarters. It is
possible that shifts in the composition of employment within these broad
industry categories are obscuring the influence of the new minimum wage on
the hourly earnings measure and that these effects therefore will be more
evident in the employment cost index for the second quarter to be released
in July; that said, data in hand suggest that the effect of the new minimum
wage was limited, perhaps because there were so few workers near or below
the new floor.

BLS recently published detailed data on benefits from a once-a-year
survey conducted in March. Continuing the trend of recent years, benefit
costs--constituting 28 percent of total compensation--rose faster than wages
between March 1989 and March 1990. Last year's increase in benefit costs
reflected a further large rise (more than 8 percent) in insurance costs--
which include health care premiums, a surge in bonuses including lump-sum
payments, and a rebound in employer contributions to pension plans.
On the collective bargaining front, the United Auto Workers (UAW) is
scheduled to begin negotiations in July with the Big Three automakers on new
three-year contracts for about 500,000 workers whose current contracts
expire on September 14. The negotiations will mark the first time since
1979 that the UAW has bargained simultaneously with all three automakers.
At its national convention in May, the UAW decided to focus on the issue of
job security and indicated that it would push for job guarantees; benefits
also are likely to receive high priority.
Industrial Production
The trend in industrial activity appears to have improved slightly this
year. The index of total industrial production rose 0.6 percent in May;
with an upward revision to the level of total output in April, the April-
May average was about 2-1/4 percent (annual rate) above that in the fourth
quarter of 1989. IP was boosted 0.4 percentage point in May by an increase
in output of motor vehicles and parts. Auto assemblies moved up to an
annual rate of 6.4 million units (FRB seasonals)--the same as in the fourth
1. In contrast to the procedure used for computing pay changes in the
Employment Cost Index (ECI), which uses fixed employment weights from the
1980 census, this survey uses current employment weights each year. Over
the past three years, employer costs increased at a somewhat slower rate
than the ECI, suggesting a shift toward lower-paid workers and industries.

quarter of last year--while truck production increased to a 4.2 million unit
annual rate, about 14 percent higher than the fourth-quarter pace. In
addition to the boost from motor vehicles--and its spillover to supplier
industries--the advances in production this year likely reflect continued
growth in exports of manufactured goods (chart).
Output of business equipment has firmed this year, reflecting the
upswing in motor vehicles, strength in aircraft, and big gains in the
production of information-processing equipment, the latter stemming in part
from a surge in exports of computers. In addition, production of other
types of business equipment has increased about 2 percent at an annual rate
so far this year, retracing its decline over the second half of last year.
In contrast, output of consumer goods excluding motor vehicles has been
relatively sluggish in recent months.
Looking ahead, indicators of manufacturing activity, such as orders for
durable goods, are consistent with modest growth in output in coming
months. Moreover, motor vehicle production looks to have increased further
in June--by enough to boost directly total industrial production 1/4 percent
after allowing for the accompanying rise in output of motor vehicle parts.
Production at industries such as metals, machinery, and plastics that supply
materials to automakers likely benefited as well.
Gains in manufacturing output so far this year have about matched the
expansion of capacity, and the factory operating rate inched up to
83 percent in May. Utilization both at advanced and at primary processing
industries has been little changed, on balance; the rate for primary
processing had declined somewhat in 1989 but remains at a relatively high
level compared with its historical average. Among industries, utilization

rates for motor vehicles, nonelectrical machinery, metals, and paper are up,
while operating rates for producers of stone, clay, and glass and for lumber
are down, reflecting the underlying weakness in building activity.
Autos and Light Trucks
Sales of autos and light trucks have remained sluggish through mid-
June. Sales of domestically produced cars have been virtually flat at about
a 6-3/4 million unit annual rate (BEA seasonals) since February, and sales
of imported cars have fluctuated around 2-3/4 million units. Meanwhile,
sales of light trucks have eased slightly from their first-quarter pace.
Despite the relatively subdued pace of sales, the domestic automakers thus
far have been able to hold their inventories in check; at the end of May,
stocks of domestic autos stood at 1.29 million units--only a 60 days' supply
even at the sluggish May sales pace.

Auto production in the second quarter is expected to total 6-1/4
million units at an annual rate (BEA seasonals)--up about 3/4 million from
the depressed first-quarter pace. All else equal, this rise in assemblies--
along with an expected increase in truck output--is expected to contribute
1-1/4 percentage points to this quarter's real GNP growth. Schedules for
the third quarter call for automobile assemblies at a 7-1/2 million unit
pace. Although these plans seem a bit high, there have been reports that
the automakers may be planning to build a buffer stock of cars in
anticipation of a possible UAW strike in September. Nevertheless, our
industry contacts insist that production plans have not been boosted in
anticipation of a possible strike; they say they would rather have too few
cars on hand in the event of a strike than too many cars without a strike.
Consumption and Personal Income
Real personal consumption expenditures appear to have slowed
considerably. The latest figures from BEA show first-quarter growth in real
PCE at only 1-1/2 percent (annual rate), down from 2-1/2 percent over the
four quarters of 1989. For the second quarter, current estimates place the
average level of spending in April and May about even with the first-quarter
pace in real terms. Outlays for goods excluding motor vehicles have been
especially weak; they fell for the third straight month in May, while
spending on motor vehicles also declined. In addition, the trend in the
growth of services excluding energy appears to have moderated; after rising
4-1/2 percent in 1989, spending for nonenergy services has been expanding at
a pace of about 3-1/2 percent (annual rate) so far this year.
BEA's estimates of spending for nonauto goods reflect the movements in
retail sales excluding those at automotive dealers and at building and

supply stores. These retail sales currently are estimated to have fallen
6-1/4 percent (annual rate) in nominal terms between February and May.
BEA's most recent estimates of consumer spending build in a stronger figure
for May than would be implied by a strict reading of the retail sales data.
Even so, the resulting figures imply extremely weak growth in outlays for
goods excluding motor vehicles (chart).
Meanwhile, other indicators that in the past have been useful in
explaining trends in spending on nonauto goods paint a stronger picture for
the current quarter than do the most recent figures on consumption.
Although growth in personal income has slowed in recent quarters, it has not
slowed nearly as much as has spending. Also, the University of Michigan's
Index of Consumer Sentiment remained about flat through May, at levels
similar to those since the mid-1980s and well above those reached during
1980-82, the last time outlays declined on net over two quarters. These
other indicators raise the possibility that consumption is not as weak as
implied by the latest data.
Business Fixed Investment
Growth in real business fixed investment has slowed appreciably since
mid-1989, and current indicators point to a continuation of this pattern in
the near term. Equipment spending has risen only about 1-1/2 percent at an
annual rate over the past three quarters, with investment in information-
processing equipment the main source of growth. Outlays for nonresidential
structures did register a sizable gain in the first quarter--probably
boosted in part by the warm weather--but the trend in this sector remains
weak.

For the second quarter, indicators of equipment spending point to a
slight decline in these outlays in real terms. Nominal shipments of
nondefense capital goods (excluding aircraft) rose 0.3 percent in May but
were still 2 percent below the first-quarter level; in particular, shipments
of nonelectrical machinery were weak in April and May. Taking into account
the appropriate PDE weights for each category to remove portions that are
not final business purchases, shipments were up 0.5 percent in May, but the
April-May average was 1-1/2 percent below the first-quarter level.
Looking ahead, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft
edged up 0.2 percent in May, but remained 1 percent below the first-quarter
level. Outside of aircraft and computers, orders have advanced little, on
balance, since the beginning of last year. However, bookings for office and
computing equipment continued to rise in April and May. Taken together,
these data point to some improvement in real PDE following the weak second
quarter (chart).
On the construction side, industrial construction rose sharply in the
first quarter, and preliminary put-in-place data point to a further gain in
April. Outlays for office and other commercial construction, however, were
down again that month. Office construction, in particular, is showing the
effects of overbuilding in many parts of the country and perhaps a
tightening of credit standards.
Looking forward, most of the indicators for construction continue to
paint a bleak picture. Permits for office construction have plummeted in
recent months (chart), and the Coldwell-Banker office measure of
metropolitan office vacancies still held in the 20 percent range at the end
of March, the latest reading. Contracts for other commercial construction

II-21
also have softened. Although industrial construction has been climbing
steeply recently, the permits and contracts data suggest that this
trajectory is unlikely to continue for long.
The most recent Commerce Department survey of capital spending, taken
in April and May, also points to a slowing in investment from last year; its
respondents plan to increase nominal outlays 6-3/4 percent in 1990, a rate
well below last year's 10-1/2 percent advance. Macroeconomic factors that
are generally believed to influence investment also point to sluggishness
this year (chart). First, nonfarm business output--which typically affects
investment with a lag--has been decelerating since early 1988. Second, the
cost of capital--for items other than computers--moved up early this year,
reflecting the rise in long-term interest rates, only part of which has
since been reversed. Finally, cash flow has been stagnant since early 1989.

II-23
Business Inventories
Inventory investment has been restrained this year, as businesses have
sought to keep stocks under tight control. Preliminary current-cost data
for April indicate a relatively small increase in overall manufacturing and
trade stocks, after a decrease in the first quarter. Since the start of the
year, stocks have been pared sharply at motor vehicle dealers, and
inventories in most other sectors have either been trimmed or expanded only
modestly. Retailers of nonauto goods also liquidated stocks this winter;
but with consumer spending weak, the inventory-sales ratio for this sector
has since retraced its earlier decline. Inventory-sales ratios for the
manufacturing and wholesale sectors at the end of April, on a current-cost
basis, were down from the levels of late 1989 and generally toward the
middle of the range of the past year.
Housing Markets
Residential construction activity weakened appreciably this spring.
Housing starts averaged 1.21 million units (annual rate) in April and May,
substantially below the 1.45 million unit pace of the first quarter. Part
of the recent drop may have been a payback after the warm winter; even so,
averaging through the weather effects, starts are running below the already
reduced pace of activity registered in 1989.
The recent weakness in housing reflects both supply and demand factors.
On the supply side, industry reports suggest that builders may be finding it
more difficult to obtain loans because of more stringent thrift capital
standards, loan-to-one-borrower limits under FIRREA, and tightened
examination standards for commercial banks. On the demand side, sales of
new homes have been trending lower for almost a year, and sales of existing

homes slipped further in May to a 3.29 million unit annual pace. In part,
housing demand may have been restrained by slower growth in incomes and the
rise in fixed-rate mortgage rates through early May. It should be noted
that an industry survey of leading mortgage bankers undertaken in May failed
to uncover any evidence of widespread cutbacks in the availability of home
mortgages; these survey findings are reinforced by the relatively stable
spread between interest rates on mortgages and other long-term instruments.
In the multifamily sector, weakness continues to be evident in both
rental and condominium markets (chart); rates of return on multifamily
rental investment remain damped, and the multifamily rental vacancy rate
in the first quarter, at 9.3 percent, was not far below the record high of
9.8 percent recorded in 1988. In addition, condominium construction has
continued to decline, although less sharply than in the mid-1980s when
activity in the South collapsed (chart). The recent softening has been
concentrated in the Northeast.
Federal Sector
In May the federal government recorded a $43 billion deficit, compared
with a figure of $26 billion in the same month of 1989. The increase mainly
reflected higher outlays, principally payments for deposit insurance. For
the October to May period, the deficit stood at $152 billion, compared with
$113 billion a year earlier; as receipts grew slowly in this period, deposit
insurance outlays surged, and spending in most other areas--with the notable
exceptions of defense and agriculture--continued to expand.
Nonwithheld personal income tax collections for April and May
(primarily final payments for 1989 and the first quarterly installment on
1990 estimated taxes) totaled $70 billion, $7 billion below a year earlier.

This pattern provides evidence that some of the surge in last year's final
payments reflected temporary factors. Refunds in April and May combined
were about the same as in 1989; however, for the January-May period as a
whole--during which about 85 percent of total refunds typically are paid--
refunds were about $3 billion above last year's level. Daily data indicate
that quarterly declarations for individual income taxes (due in mid-June)
are running slightly above a year earlier, while corporate income tax
declarations are below last year's pace.
In late March, the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) announced
"Operation Clean Sweep," a plan to sell or liquidate 141 thrifts during the
second quarter. This operation was expected to cost up to $46 billion,
after taking account of the $3.5 billion provided by the Resolution Funding
Corporation (REFCORP). Outlays in April were essentially zero on net as
spending for thrift resolutions was offset by the proceeds of the April
REFCORP offering. However, spending picked up to $7 billion in May and to
$13 billion in the first three weeks of June. Any shortfall relative to the
$46 billion target is expected to be made up in the next few months, along
with additional spending to close some of the 50 to 75 thrifts targeted for
resolution during the third quarter.
Estimates of the FY1990 and FY1991 deficits have risen substantially
since January, reflecting the lower tax collections that have accompanied
weaker economic activity, higher interest rates, and substantially higher
RTC spending, especially for working capital. The Congressional Budget
Office released its summer budget estimates in June--two months earlier than
normal; they show a deficit, excluding RTC spending, of $159 billion for
FY1990 and a $162 billion current services deficit for FY1991. RTC spending

II-31
is estimated to total $36 billion in FY1990 and $70 billion in FY1991,
assuming new legislation is passed to provide additional spending authority.
The Office of Management and Budget will release its Mid-Session Review in
mid-July; it will include new deficit figures and provide information on the
effects of a sequester. Press reports indicate that OMB's deficit
projections, excluding RTC, will be in the neighborhood of $155 billion for
FY1990 and $159 billion for FY1991. OMB has estimated that FY1990 RTC
spending will range between $26 billion to $48 billion, and from $41 billion
to $68 billion in FY1991.
The House and the Senate have passed budget resolutions that are
consistent with the $64 billion target, based on OMB's January economic and
technical assumptions, and have begun to work on FY1991 appropriations. 2
Meanwhile, the congressional leadership and the Administration are in the
midst of negotiations on the FY1991 budget, and the President announced his
willingness to consider tax increases as part of a deficit-reduction
package. Looking ahead, the public debt may reach the statutory limit as
early as late July; in the past, debt ceiling bills have served as vehicles
for the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. Under the current G-R-H law, the OMB
deficit estimates cited in press reports imply a sequester of up to $163
billion on October 15. Even if the law is modified to exclude RTC spending
from the calculations, the sequester could still be as much as $95 billion.
A sequester of $95 billion would impose across-the-board cuts of 36 percent
on affected nondefense programs and 24 percent on affected defense programs.
2. According to CBO calculations, both FY1991 resolutions cut defense
spending by over $11 billion. The House resolution allows for a $4 billion
increase in domestic discretionary spending, while the Senate's measure
reduces it by $4 billion.

State and Local Government Sector
Activity in the state and local government sector has moderated this
spring, after two quarters of robust growth. On balance, employment
continued to advance in April and May but less rapidly than earlier in the
year. Real outlays on structures dropped sharply again in April to a level
well below the first-quarter average. In particular, outlays for highways
have declined substantially after peaking in February and are now back in
the range reported during most of last year.
The NIPA deficit of operating and capital accounts for the entire state
and local sector remains unusually high, and budgetary gaps have remained a
focus of recent sessions of state legislatures. State governments often
turn to spending cuts first when stabilizing shaky budgets, but in recent
years they have been besieged by local demands, court orders, and federal
mandates that have resulted in increased spending in areas like education,
medicaid, and corrections. Spending in these three areas accounts for
nearly two-thirds of states' general fund budgets currently (chart), and it
is likely to continue rising at a pace exceeding GNP growth. Public
school enrollment began to rise in 1985, and population statistics indicate
that the baby-boom echo will continue to boost enrollments in the 1990s as
well. Medicaid expenditures also have increased in recent years as the
federal government has required the states to cover individuals at higher
levels of income and to cover previously optional services. Finally,
3. State general fund budgets cover around 60 percent of total state
outlays, primarily operating expenditures, and are required constitutionally
or statutorily to be balanced (except in Vermont). In addition to current
receipts and expenditures as recorded in the national income accounts,
states' general fund accounts also may include resources available from
previous years, funds borrowed in capital markets, and even proposed, but
not yet enacted, tax hikes.

II-34
corrections spending has been the fastest growing component of states'
general fund budgets for the past five years. The state prison population
has more than doubled in the past decade, and with many states under court
order to relieve overcrowding, outlays for new structures are expected to
continue rising.
Prices
As expected, the first-quarter burst of inflation subsided this spring.
The consumer price index increased 0.2 percent in both April and May, and
producer prices of finished goods were unchanged on net over the two-month
period. Developments in the food and energy sectors have turned more
favorable of late, and deceleration also has been evident in price measures
that exclude food and energy. Nonetheless, with the average rate of
consumer price increase up this year from the 1989 pace, a clear turn in the
inflation trend still is lacking.
The CPI for energy retreated 0.4 percent in April and 0.7 percent in
May, when declines were posted for gasoline and fuel oil. With oil
producers still having difficulty restraining production, crude oil prices
have remained under downward pressure in June. Nevertheless, gasoline
prices--supported by tight supplies associated with refinery shutdowns--have
stayed relatively high, and private survey data point to an increase at
retail in June. As refineries come back on line, margins likely will fall.
Retail food prices were down 0.2 percent in April and unchanged in May.
The index for fresh fruits and vegetables fell further and now has largely
retraced its runup of earlier this year. Meat prices, however, have
continued to rise this spring, as pork production has dropped sharply, and
on balance the year-to-year rate of increase in the prices of other foods is

running about in line with general inflation. At the farm level, about one-
third of the nation's winter wheat crop has been harvested as of June 24;
total wheat production likely will be up considerably this year from the low
levels of the past four years. The other major crops appeared to be in
reasonably good condition as of late June, even though persistent rains
through the spring may have caused farmers either to alter their mix of
crops or, in some cases, even to leave water-logged acreage idle. With
inventories of many crops running at low levels, a serious shortfall in this
year's harvest might well put sharp upward pressure on prices.
Excluding food and energy items, retail prices of other goods were
unchanged in April and edged up 0.1 percent in May. In considerable part,
the slowing after the first quarter reflected movements in apparel prices,
which registered no change in April and fell 0.5 percent in May after rising
more than 5 percent in the February-March period. Declines also were posted
for prices of new cars and, in April, for house furnishings. The CPI for
non-energy services rose 0.4 percent in April and May, well below the first-
quarter rate but similar to the pace in recent years. Prices declined or
slowed for several items that had boosted the pace this winter, notably for
lodging out-of-town and airfares. However, prices rose rapidly in a number
of other categories, including legal, medical, and cable TV services.
Despite the moderation in April and May, the CPI total excluding food
and energy items has risen 4.8 percent over the last twelve months, at the
upper end of the range observed during the past seven years (chart).
Businesses have continued to face labor cost pressures, and with import
prices turning up this year, this source of downward pressure on domestic
expenditure prices has been eliminated.

At the producer level, prices of finished goods less food and energy
rose 0.2 percent in April and May, held down by declines for motor vehicles.
Discounting by motor vehicle manufacturers has been largely responsible for
the slower pace of this PPI measure over the first five months of the year--
about 3 percent at an annual rate compared with 4-1/4 percent in 1988 and
1989. Prices of intermediate materials less food and energy have risen only
a little this year. However, the PPI for crude nonfood materials less
energy has increased more than 5 percent since February, mainly reflecting
the firming in prices of metal scrap. Nevertheless, this index remained
below its level of a year earlier. Since the mid-May pricing date for the
PPI, price movements in spot commodity markets for industrial materials have
been mixed, with declines for copper but some net increases for steel scrap
and cotton.
Probability of Recession
Despite apparent slow growth in the economy, a recession-probability
measure based on the Commerce Department's May index of leading economic
indicators suggests that the probability of a recession starting in the next
4six months is only 5 percent (chart). A second probability measure,
compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research, shows a 7 percent
probability of recession in its most recent reading. 5
4. This measure is described in Francis X. Diebold and Glenn D. Rudebusch,
"Scoring the Leading Indicators," Journal of Business, vol. 62 (July 1989),
pp. 369-91.
5. The index and the forecasting procedure are described in James H. Stock
and Mark W. Watson, "New Indexes of Coincident and Leading Economic
Indicators," in Olivier Jean Blanchard and Stanley Fischer, eds., NBER
Macroeconomics Annual 1989 (MIT Press, 1989), pp. 351-94.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Anchored by a stable federal funds rate, most money market yields have
changed little on balance since the May FOMC meeting. At the same time,
however, a run of soft economic indicators and confirmation of the expected
slowing of price increases have bolstered sentiment in the bond market and
pushed long-term yields somewhat lower, especially on private instruments.
Stock prices rose sharply early in June but have fallen since then, and most
broad indexes are little changed, on net, over the period.
M2 declined in May, dragging it well below the midpoint of its 3 to 7
percent target range for 1990. M3 also fell, leaving it below its 2-1/2 to
6-1/2 percent target range. The recent weakness in the monetary aggregates
has been caused partly by the increased pace of restructuring of the thrift
industry and an associated decline in the amount of financial intermediation
taking place at depository institutions, as large amounts of thrift assets
have gone to the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) and other
nondepositories. For banks, the combination of weakened demands for credit,
some restrictions on credit to certain classes of borrowers, and substantial
inflows of core deposits from thrifts has reduced the need to attract
deposits and has fostered recent declines in offering rates. Preliminary
data for June suggest a rebound to moderate growth in all the aggregates.
Overall Treasury borrowing slowed in the second quarter, despite the
large funding requirements of the RTC. Borrowing by state and local
governments remained subdued over much of the quarter, but offerings in June
were buoyed by a pickup in short-term volume. Private credit flows appear
to have remained weak in the second quarter. Nonfinancial business

borrowing was moderate, despite some strengthening in bond issuance.
Although mortgage rates declined from their April peak, housing data through
May suggest that residential mortgage lending has slowed. Consumer
installment credit, which posted its weakest advance in three years in the
first quarter, has shown no signs of strength this quarter.
Over the intermeeting period concerns persisted that the economy was
experiencing a "credit crunch" with lenders pulling back on credit supplies
in response to perceived pressures from examiners, capital constraints, and
asset quality problems that have led to recent downgradings of bank holding
company debt. Available evidence has continued to suggest that such shifts
in credit supply have had either a regional (Northeast) or a sectoral (real
estate) focus. Just how much of any cutback was the response of banks to a
weaker economy and perceived risks, and how much to regulatory change,
hasn't been clear.
The signals of credit stringency are mixed for business finance. The
willingness of banks and investors to finance highly leveraged
restructurings clearly has diminished. It also appears, but is difficult to
confirm in macro statistics, that a broader effect has been felt by smaller
businesses. Surveys taken in the spring by the Federal Reserve indicate
that banks had tightened their terms for small- and intermediate-sized
business borrowers. Nonetheless, surveys by the National Federation of
Independent Business show that, while an increasing number of businesses
have discerned some firming in credit availability in recent months, the
firming has not been very substantial. For home mortgages and for most
forms of consumer credit, unusual credit restraint does not appear to be an
important explanation for slower loan growth. In short, the evidence

suggests that the shift in credit conditions is a real phenomenon, but most
likely of much lesser importance that the decibel level of complaint might
suggest.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
All the monetary aggregates contracted in May: Ml at a 2-1/2 percent
rate, M2 at a 2-3/4 percent rate, and M3 at a 2-1/2 percent rate. 1 Within
Ml, demand deposits fell sharply. Inquiries of corporate cash managers did
not uncover any special reason for this runoff, but part of it may have
reflected a response of compensating balances to the first-quarter increase
in money market yields. Other checkable deposits (OCDs) were flat in May,
after expanding briskly over the previous three months. So far in June,
OCDs have been growing at a double-digit rate, suggesting that May's
weakness was an aberration, perhaps because of the incomplete capture by the
seasonal factors of tax-related outflows. Currency remained a source of
strength in May, though growing more slowly than in the first quarter.
Growth in the sum of savings, MMDAs, and small time deposits slowed to
a crawl in May. Substantial transfers of these core deposits from thrift
institutions to banks, through the activities of the RTC, may have depressed
overall deposit growth, as banks, in the face of weak credit growth, held
down offering rates on small time deposits (chart). Even at these
relatively low offering rates, M2 deposit inflows rose further relative to
the increase in bank credit (chart), and, given the decline in thrift
assets, they more than covered the expansion of depository institution
credit.
1. A longer-run view of Ml, M2, and M3 is given in Mr. Reinhart's memo to
the FOMC entitled "The Behavior of the Monetary Aggregates in the First Half
of 1990."

M2 growth in May also was held down by a sharp runoff in shares of
money market mutual funds (MMMFs). The recent reversal of MMMF growth rates
reflected a shift in relative yields, with MMMFs currently yielding about 25
to 50 basis points less than six-month T-bills. In addition, buoyancy in
stock and bond markets in May reportedly siphoned funds from MMMFs into
stock and bond mutual funds in May and to a lesser extent in June. With
small time deposit rates low relative to market yields, some funds likely
were diverted to Treasury issues and other market paper; noncompetitive
tenders remained strong last month. The rise in opportunity costs of
holding M2 contributed to an estimated further increase in its velocity in
the second quarter (chart). However, this increase in velocity appears to
be greater than can be explained by past relationships with standard
measures of opportunity costs and may be an aspect of the shifting of
household liquid assets associated with the massive volume of thrift
resolutions.
The drop in M3 reflected a substantial decline in thrift assets
together with continued moderate expansion in bank credit. The non-M2
component of M3 fell at about the same rate as in April. Contraction of
large time deposits at thrifts accelerated, as the RTC hit its stride, but
these deposits resumed growth at banks after having fallen for several
months.
Bank credit expanded at a 4 percent annual rate in May, about matching
the pace seen in April. Acquisitions of U.S. government securities
accelerated in May in part because of in net additions of mortgage-backed
securities. Real estate loans rebounded to a 12-1/2 percent pace, after two
months of single-digit growth. About 1-1/2 percentage points of this growth

was attributable to transfers of thrift assets to commercial banks. In
addition, part of the slowing of real estate loans in March and April
probably reflected increased loan charge-offs.
Business loans contracted in May. This weakness, which partly
reflected the absence of merger-related loans, was widespread across regions
of the country. The May survey of the terms of bank lending to businesses
(STBL) suggested that rate and non-rate terms of loans to smaller business
have firmed a little since the winter. These results are consistent with
previous surveys of bank officers and small businesses, which indicated some
tightening of credit supplies, but nothing like a widespread cutoff of
funds.
Consumer loans rebounded to a 4-1/2 percent pace, reflecting less
securitization than in April. Adjusted for securitization, April and May
growth rates were both about 5 percent, somewhat below the first quarter
pace. So far in June, growth of bank credit at large banks has picked up a
bit, mainly on the strength of increases in U.S. government securities.
Business Finance
Short-term borrowing by nonfinancial firms has been sluggish in recent
weeks. Both bank loans and commercial paper contracted in May and have
2expanded only slightly in June. Some firms apparently have taken
advantage of lower bond yields to issue longer-term debt. Gross public bond
issuance by nonfinancial corporations with investment-grade ratings surged
in June. Offerings by utilities were especially strong, while industrial
issuance also strengthened. Proceeds from some of the offerings were used

Chrysler Financial, do not appear to have led to disruptions in the

to retire commercial paper and bank debt. Several large convertible bond
issues have been among this month's offerings, as have bonds with put
options.
Issuance of junk bonds picked up in May and June, but remained well
below the pace of recent years. In contrast to 1988 and 1989, most of the
junk issues in 1990 have included a feature allowing the bonds to be
converted into stock. The proceeds from some of these convertible offerings
have been used to pay down or redeem conventional debt obligations. In
addition, some firms have used the proceeds from asset sales, bank loans, or
private placements to buy back more than $2 billion of public junk bonds.
Some speculative-grade companies also have issued equity to finance reverse
LBOs, in which a company formerly taken private goes public by issuing
stock. Thus far in 1990, reverse LBOs have totaled about $700 million,
about equal to their volume in each of the years 1988 and 1989. Such
reductions in leverage have been available only to companies with improving
credit fundamentals, however, as outside investors have not been willing to
take equity positions in companies whose cash flows barely cover their debt
service.
Prices of junk bonds, and in particular those of RJR-Nabisco, the
largest debtor in the high-yield market, were generally higher over the
intermeeting period, and spreads over comparable Treasury issues narrowed by
30 to 40 basis points. Reports circulated that Kohlberg, Kravis, and
Roberts, the owners of RJR-Nabisco, were prepared to inject more equity into
this LBO by buying back some of the bonds with reset features before their
April, 1991 deadline. On the negative side, defaults by a few high-profile

III-11
issuers in June brought the total for the year to $10.5 billion, about equal
to defaults for all of 1989.
The Dow-Jones Industrial Average and the NYSE Composite Index rose to
record levels in early June, but later fell back considerably, and on
balance over the intermeeting period are little changed. The S&P 500 price-
earnings ratio increased to its highest level since November 1987.
Resolution Trust Corporation Activity
Since the beginning of the second quarter, the RTC has resolved 138
thrifts, making it likely that the Corporation will meet its goal of 141
resolutions for the quarter. Since the enactment of FIRREA, 190 thrifts,
with liabilities of $63 billion, have been resolved, including 21
liquidations, 85 insured deposit transfers, and 84 purchase and assumptions.
In dollar terms most of the insured deposit transfers and purchases and
assumptions involved commercial banks, with the remainder being acquired by
other thrift institutions. Only a portion of the assets have been sold in
these transactions, so that the RTC is holding about $20 billion of the
resolved thrifts' assets on its books. Since acquirers have been given
options to put some assets back to the RTC, the Corporation may soon end up
with considerably more assets.
Through the middle of June, out of $78 billion authorized, the RTC had
spent about $55 billion, with three-fourths going to resolutions (to
eliminate negative net worth and finance assets acquired) and the remainder
being pumped into thrifts operating in conservatorship. The final
resolution cost for the 182 thrifts for which data are available was
estimated at $21 billion.

Despite the quickened pace of resolutions, 259 thrifts remained in
conservatorship. Over half of the $163 billion in assets at these thrifts
were loans that were either nonperforming or that did not conform to
underwriting standards in the secondary mortgage market. Another one-fourth
of these assets was in the form of cash and securities, with the remainder
consisting of real estate owned and other assets. In the near future
another 270 thrifts, holding $170 billion in assets, are expected to be
placed in conservatorship.
The pace of asset sales has been slowed by startup delays for the new
agency, a highly restrictive rule in the FIRREA law for determining fair
market value of assets, and restrictions on the amount of seller financing
that the RTC can provide. Nonetheless, the Corporation remained hopeful
that several large loan packages would be sold this summer.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
About $30 billion of Treasury outlays for the RTC eliminated the
federal government's seasonal surplus, leaving a small deficit for the
second quarter. Because of RTC funding needs, the Treasury has been raising
the gross sizes of its regular bill auctions. The gross sizes of some
coupon issues also have been increased. The $20 billion decline in total
marketable borrowing that the staff estimates occurred in the second quarter
was largely accounted for by a swing in net cash management bill issuance
from $10 billion of cash raised in the first quarter to a paydown of $19
billion in the second.
In general, debt issuance by government sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
has been light, and yield spreads to Treasury securities have remained
relatively tight. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) have continued to pay

III-14
down debt at a brisk pace as the demand for advances by their member
institutions has ebbed. The Farm Credit System Financial Assistance
Corporation (FAC) came to market in June for the first time in more than a
year. The $325 million, 15-year issue was priced at a spread of 34 basis
points over the 10-year Treasury note and was intended to retire the
remaining liabilities of the bankrupt Federal Land-Bank of Jackson,
Mississippi. Press reports indicate that the U.S. Postal Service (which has
full agency status) is proposing to sell debt directly to the public for the
first time since 1972.
At the end of May, the Treasury released its congressionally mandated
study of the GSEs. The study stressed that the special relationship that
the market perceives to exist between GSEs and the federal government can
lead to a bias toward excessive risk-taking by highly leveraged GSEs. To
counteract this bias, the Treasury recommended that GSEs take steps that
would ensure a triple-A credit rating, apart from any implicit federal
guarantee. Those GSEs that did not comply within five years would lose
their ties to the federal government. There was no apparent market impact
of this report on agency debt. The General Accounting Office is expected to
release its study of GSEs in about a month.
Municipal Securities
Municipal bond issuance picked up slightly in May and June, boosted by
a large volume of education and housing issues. Refunding volume continued
light during most of this period before spurting late in June in response to
yield declines. Short-term volume surged to a record of more than $7
billion in June, including more than $4 billion of borrowing by New York

III-15
State to cover a budgetary shortfall and about $1 billion of seasonal
borrowing by Los Angeles County.

Reflecting weaker economic conditions in the Northeast, downgradings of
municipal credit ratings by Standard and Poor's outpaced upgradings by three
to one in the first quarter. Of the 87 downgradings in the first quarter,
three-fifths were for issuers in Northeastern states, with most concentrated
among state agencies and housing authorities. The first-quarter pattern was
a reversal of 1989 experience, when upgradings exceeded downgradings.
The volume of municipal bond offerings has dropped sharply since
passage of the Tax Reform Act that limited uses of tax-exempt financing for
certain private purposes and tightened arbitrage restrictions. In the first
half of 1990, issuance has been running at an estimated annual pace of $95
billion, well below the record high $214 billion in 1985. This drop in
volume, and a corresponding drop in underwriting profitability, led Bank of

Boston Corporation and Citicorp early in June to announce the closing of
their municipal securities underwriting subsidiaries.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage lending slowed in the early part of 1990, most noticeably in
the case of construction credit. Construction loans on the books of
commercial banks edged down during the first quarter, as they had a quarter
earlier. At SAIF-insured thrifts the latest data available showed
construction loans falling by 14 percent in the five months ending in
January. Sluggish rates of residential construction through May and a
declining trend in contracts for nonresidential structures suggest continued
softness in construction lending in the second quarter. The pricing of
construction credit has not changed appreciably this year, but nonprice
terms have tightened. Bank officers surveyed earlier this year reported
lower maximum loan amounts, lower allowable loan-to-value ratios, and new
restrictions on out-of-area lending.
Judging from the low volume of new and existing home sales in recent
months, growth of home mortgages probably has slowed further in the second
quarter. The slowdown in home credit growth seems to be coming from reduced
demand. Spreads of yields on primary market mortgages over Treasury
securities of comparable maturity have not widened in recent months,
suggesting that pricing practices in the residential mortgage market have
not been altered (chart). Downpayment requirements and other nonprice terms
have not changed much of late, either, and a recent industry survey of
mortgage bankers found no evidence of a general cutback in credit supply to
home buyers.

Indicators of mortgage credit quality for the first quarter of 1990
have been mixed. At banks, the delinquency rate on mortgages of all types
rose to 5.9 percent, the highest rate since 1984. The net charge-off rate,
which has a strong seasonal component, was 0.68 percent in the first
quarter, well above the same-quarter rate in recent years. At life
insurance companies, delinquent loans on commercial properties fueled a
sharp increase in overall delinquencies in the first quarter. Although high
by recent standards, delinquencies at insurance companies remained well
below rates recorded in 1986 and 1987. Delinquencies on home mortgages
declined significantly during the quarter, according to a Mortgage Bankers
Association survey of servicers of these loans.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit in April grew at only a 1 percent annual
rate, following its weakest quarter in three years. The anemic pace was
attributable to the auto credit component, which declined at a 10 percent
annual rate in April. Revolving credit picked up to a 14 percent rate,
close to the pace of last year. Most of the statistics and qualitative
reports in the financial press suggest that conditions in the consumer
credit market probably have tightened a bit, but not enough to explain the
slackening in loan growth. The weakest element of consumer credit in April,
auto loans, was the one least likely to undergo substantial supply
constraint, because it is a secured form of credit and because the finance
subsidiaries of the car manufacturers tend to take up the slack when other
financial institutions retreat from the market. Responses on recent Senior
Loan Officer Opinion Surveys about banks' willingness to make consumer loans
have not provided evidence of tightening, and interest rates on consumer

loans at banks have been fairly flat (chart). While spreads of consumer
loan rates relative to Treasury yields have been much higher than in the
early 1980s (when state usury ceilings capped consumer rates in some areas),
they have changed little on balance since 1985 (chart). Moreover, none of
the available delinquency series has pointed to any pronounced worsening of
consumer loan quality in recent months.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade balance narrowed in April to a preliminary
deficit of $6.9 billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis), from the March
deficit (revised) of $8.4 billion. Both imports and exports fell in April,
with lower oil imports and agricultural exports accounting for about
one-third of the decline in each respective category. Much of the remaining
decline in total exports and imports was the result of a drop in exports and
imports of automotive products that reversed large increases in February and
March.
The decline in the value of oil imports in April reflected a 9 percent
decline in price and a 13 percent decline in volume. The sharp drop in

prices was in line with the behavior of spot and posted prices throughout
March and early April. Oil prices, weak as a result of strong OPEC
production throughout a mild first quarter, temporarily strengthened after
the announcement of an emergency OPEC session to be held early in May.
Prices have generally fallen since the emergency session due to the lack of
evidence of widespread OPEC production restraint. This recent weakness in
spot prices should result in a further $1 drop in the price of imported oil
over the next two months. The decline in volume in April was also
anticipated, but the size of the decline was substantially greater than had
been indicated in advance by preliminary Department of Energy data, which
are now likely to be revised significantly. Declines in agricultural
exports were spread across many different commodities.
For the first quarter, the value of imported oil was significantly
higher than in any quarter of last year. The average price of imported oil

was $1.80 per barrel above that of the fourth quarter. The quantity of oil
imported in the first quarter was 6 percent higher than in the fourth
quarter. A surge of oil imports in January reflected the rebuilding of
stocks that were depleted during the cold snap last December, while the
strength in February and March was attributable to declines in domestic
production.

In the first quarter, a surge in exports, coupled with flat non-oil
imports, led to a $10 billion decline (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in
the merchandise trade deficit on a balance-of-payments basis (see table

same in the first quarter as in the
fourth quarter of last year; a 1 percent decline in quantity was about
offset by a small increase in import prices. Declines in both the value and
quantity of imported consumer goods, industrial supplies (especially gold,
steel, and other metals), and automotive products from Canada were offset by
increases in imported foods, automotive products from Japan and Europe, and
other imported products. The decline in imports of automotive products from
Canada reflects in part the effects of reduced automotive production during
January designed to shrink inventories.

Exports in the first quarter were about 5 percent above the
fourth-quarter level; the increase was entirely in quantity as prices were
little changed from the fourth quarter. The increase in both value and
quantity was largely in aircraft, other capital goods, and industrial

IV-5
supplies. Aircraft exports rebounded in the first quarter as normal
production resumed and backlogs in deliveries were reduced sharply following
the strike at Boeing from early October to late November of last year. A
decrease in exports of automotive products to Canada (reflecting reduced
U.S. production in the first quarter) more than offset an increase in
exports of automotive products to other areas. Agricultural exports rose 7
percent in the first quarter, with most of the increase in quantity; exports
were bolstered by a pickup in Soviet purchases of wheat.
Import and Export Prices
In April, prices for U.S. exports increased 0.4 percent, according to
Bureau of Labor Statistics data, largely because of a 1.6 percent increase
in the index for agricultural products (see table on the next page). Prices
of exports of wheat and corn rose in April, the second consecutive month in
which prices for exports of corn increased. Prices of non-agricultural
exports showed no increase for April, after increasing slightly in March.
Among capital goods, increases in prices for exported oil drilling equipment
and agricultural machinery were offset by declines in prices for exported
computers and electrical equipment. Prices of non-oil imports fell 0.2
percent in April, the first decline since last August. Declines in prices
for both imported capital goods and automotive vehicles were attributable in
part to lagged effects of the appreciation of the dollar in March. Price
data for May, to be released on June 28, will be covered in the Greenbook
supplement.

U.S. Current Account in the First Quarter of 1990
The U.S. current account deficit narrowed to $92 billion (seasonally
adjusted annual rate) in the first quarter, from $107 billion (revised) in
the fourth quarter (see table below). Two-thirds of the improvement in the
first quarter was accounted for by merchandise trade. Most of the remaining
improvement was a reduction in unilateral transfers from the strong fourth
quarter level. There were only small changes in the levels of net direct
investment income and in net portfolio income. The balance on other
services declined slightly, as increases in net travel and passenger fare
receipts were more than offset by an increase in net payments on reinsurance
transactions.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Recently released data for U.S. international transactions for the
first quarter of 1990 show a dramatic decline in the flow of foreign direct
investment into the United States. The inflow of $7.6 billion for the first
quarter, down from an average of $18 billion per quarter in 1989, was the
lowest in over two years (line 7 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table). One reason for this slowdown was the partial reversal
of large fourth quarter inflows of intracompany debt between foreign parents
and U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, foreign takeovers of U.S. companies
slowed somewhat from the rate in 1989. However, it is likely that the
preliminary number for the direct investment inflow will be revised upward
as more information becomes available. Since the beginning of 1988,
revisions have raised the preliminary figure for all but one quarter, with
an average increase of $4.5 billion (quarterly rate) between the preliminary
and revised data.
The flow of direct investment abroad remained near recent historical
levels (line 6), so that the net inflow of direct investment in the first
quarter fell to zero, contrary to earlier expectations. It was noted in the
May Greenbook, on the basis of advance information provided in the Treasury
International Capital (TIC) reports, that the capital account counterpart to
the current account deficit in the first quarter was not likely to be
evident in other reported capital flows. The Summary table shows that this
was in fact the case. The substantial banking inflow of $17.4 billion in
the first quarter (line 1) was nearly balanced by outflows associated with
the other, non-direct-investment items in the table: modest declines in
foreign holdings of U.S. securities ($0.8 billion, lines 2 and 3), a decline
of foreign official reserve assets held in the United States ($7.8 billion,
line 4), a rise in U.S. official reserve assets ($3.2 billion, line 5), and

changes in miscellaneous items ($3.6 billion, line 8). The net result was a
statistical discrepancy of almost $21 billion, 90 percent of the current
account deficit for the quarter.
The capital account counterpart to the current account deficit again
was not evident in the April data reported in the Summary table. Outflows
related to private securities transactions (line 2) and foreign net sales of
Treasury obligations (line 3) outweighed the small inflows associated with
banks (line 1) and holdings of official reserve assets in the United States
(line 4). The net sales of U.S. stocks by foreigners in April continued the
pattern established since the stock market drop in October.
More recent data, however, indicate a pickup of capital inflows in May
through U.S. banking offices and the Eurobond market. Line 1 of the
International Banking Data table shows a reduction in the net claims of U.S.
banking offices on their own foreign offices and IBFs of almost $12 billion
in May. Moreover, public offerings of Eurobonds by U.S. corporations jumped
to $2.8 billion in May, the largest total since June of 1989. Over $1
billion of this amount was denominated in foreign currencies.
Finally, line 3 of the table on International Banking Data suggests a
partial explanation of the statistical discrepancy in the first quarter.
Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbank residents, an item significantly under-
reported in the U.S. international transactions accounts, showed a net
capital inflow of $10.8 billion between December and March (and an
additional inflow of $5.9 billion in April). In contrast, the TIC data used
in the U.S. international transactions accounts showed an inflow of less
than $1 billion in the first quarter for the same category.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the May 15 FOMC meeting, the trade-weighted, foreign exchange
value of the dollar against the other G-10 currencies is about unchanged on
balance. Early in the period, the dollar moved up, supported in part by
perceptions that the Federal Reserve is not likely to ease soon, despite the
release of data showing signs of weakening U.S. economic activity. The
dollar also firmed in reaction to the apparent deterioration of support for
the policies of Soviet President Gorbachev, as well as with other political
developments in Germany, Japan, and Canada. Later, however, the dollar
declined on expectations of lower U.S. interest rates following a statement
by President Bush in which he indicated that tax revenue increases should be
a part of the budget deficit reduction measures considered in the budget
summit.
The mark weakened more than 3/4 percent against the dollar during the
intermeeting period. The yield on the bellwether bond rose slightly, while
short-term interest rates in Germany were little changed. News of the
details of financing the East German budget deficit, opposition by some
members of the Social Democratic Party to the unification treaty, concerns
about unresolved legal issues in the unification process, and statements by
Bundesbank officials questioning the need for higher interest rates as the
unification process continues, all weighed on the mark. Unrest in the
Soviet Union also contributed to the downward pressure.
The yen declined more than 1-3/4 percent against the dollar during the
period, and the yield on the bellwether bond rose nearly 30 basis points to
about 7.20 percent. Background factors cited in financial market commentary
include a by-election loss by the Liberal Democratic Party, the possibility
of yet another stock scandal in Japan, this one involving an aid to Prime
Minister Kaifu, and renewed difficulties in U.S.-Japan trade negotiations.

Short-term interest rates in Japan were little changed during most of the
period, but have recently edged upward. The rate on 3-month CDs rose 10
basis points over the intermeeting period to about 7.45 percent.
After fluctuating widely in reaction to waves of pessimism and
optimism about the passage of the Meech Lake accord, the Canadian dollar
ended the intermeeting period 3/4 percent higher against the U.S. dollar.
Expectations at the beginning of the period that Canadian interest rates
interest rates might fall in the near term were damped by official
statements indicating that inflation is still a concern. These statements,
coupled with expectations late in the period that the scope for U.S.
interest rates to fall might increase, appear to have supported the Canadian
dollar.
Sterling continued to move up, rising nearly 4 percent against the
dollar and more than 4-3/4 percent against the mark during the period. U.K.
bond and stock prices also moved up considerably. The yield on the
bellwether bond in the United Kingdom declined 80 basis points to 11.30
percent, and stock prices rose 11-1/4 percent. Apparently, inflation
expectations were revised downward and the credibility of U.K. monetary
policy was enhanced following indications that Prime Minister Thatcher had
withdrawn her opposition to joining the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the
European Monetary System (EMS). Sterling moved up further later in reaction
to a news report that indicated sterling may enter the ERM as soon as this
autumn
Within the ERM of the EMS, the lira remained at the top of the narrow
band and the French franc at the bottom. To counter the lira's strength,
Italian authorities lowered the discount rate 1 percentage point to 12-1/2
percent and have allowed three-month interest rates to decline nearly 150
basis points to 11 percent. Comparable interest rates in France have risen

IV-15
nearly 50 basis points to 10 percent.
On May 29, the Desk began a program of quiet mark sales into the
market for the account of the Treasury. These sales are designed to reduce
the large holdings of marks and increase holdings of dollars available to
the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The proceeds of these
operations will enable the ESF to pay down some of the marks warehoused with
the Federal Reserve. As of this writing, a little more than $500 million
has been purchased.
The price of gold has declined 5 percent to $349.35 over the
intermeeting period, amid reports that the Soviet Union is selling gold to
obtain hard currency.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Latest data indicate that on average real GNP growth picked up in the
first quarter, although this strength was not evenly distributed. In both
Germany and Japan, real GNP grew at double-digit annual rates in the first
quarter. In both countries, however, special factors (a weather-related
construction boom in Germany and a changing seasonal pattern of auto exports
in Japan) appear to have accounted for much of this surge in recorded
growth. Preliminary indications early in the second quarter suggest a
return to more moderate growth rates in both countries. First-quarter real
GDP growth rates were moderate in Canada, France and the United Kingdom,
ranging between 2 percent and 3 percent at annual rates.

IV-16
Inflation rates have been unchanged or somewhat lower in recent
months, except in the United Kingdom where special factors helped push the
12-month consumer-price inflation rate up to nearly 10 percent.
Movements of trade balances so far this year have been mixed. Trade
surpluses in Germany, Japan, and Canada were at higher rates in the first
quarter than in the previous quarter, while the trade deficits in Italy and
the United Kingdom increased over this period.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, real GNP (s.a.a.r.) increased
10.4 percent in the first quarter. This was a sharp rise from the 3.4
percent growth rate in the previous quarter. The more rapid growth was due
entirely to a sharp swing from negative to positive in the contribution from
the external sector. In contrast, domestic demand, especially consumption
and investment in plant and equipment, continued to slow. In the first
quarter, consumption increased at an annual rate of only 2.2 percent. Plant
and equipment spending increased at an 11.3 percent rate, and residential
investment grew at an 8.5 percent rate. The substantial contribution from
net exports in the first quarter reflected a strong 38.7 percent rate of
export growth (distorted upward by a changing seasonal pattern of auto
exports) and a slowing of import growth to 8.8 percent.
Other more recent indicators of the pace of real activity have been
somewhat mixed, but in general seem to indicate continued strains on
industrial capacity and labor markets. Industrial production, which rose
only 3.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter and declined by 1 percent
in April, increased 2.4 percent in May. The rate of capacity utilization
(s.a.) rose by 2.2 percent in March, reaching its highest level in seven
months, and retail sales, which grew 11.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter, rose an additional 1.7 percent in April. The unemployment rate

IV-20
(s.a.), after reaching a ten-year low of 2 percent in March, edged up to 2.1
percent in April.
Twelve-month inflation rates have eased in recent months, reflecting
in large part the passing of the impact from the introduction of the
consumption tax in April of last year. In May, Tokyo consumer prices
(n.s.a.) showed a 12-month increase of 2.7 percent, well below the 3.8
percent peak rate of February. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) declined by 0.3
percent in May, and the 12-month increase fell to 1.7 percent, compared with
a peak of 3.9 percent in March. The decline in wholesale prices in May was
due in large part to a 2.2 percent fall in import prices in the month,
reflecting the yen's recovery on exchange markets. In March and April, in
contrast, when the yen depreciated, import prices rose by a total of 6.1
percent.
The trade surplus (s.a.a.r.) in the first five months of the year, at
$53.1 billion, was well below the surplus of $77.3 billion recorded in the
same period last year, but was about unchanged from the $53.9 billion
surplus rate in the last five months of last year. The current account has
shown a similar pattern.
Real GNP (s.a.a.r.) in Germany increased 14.1 percent in the first
quarter. Every category of domestic demand rose strongly with the exception
of inventory accumulation which fell sharply. The most spectacular increase
in investment came in construction, which was up 104 percent, due to mild
weather and strong demand caused by recent immigration. Investment in
equipment increased 29.4 percent. Private consumption increased 10.6
percent in response to a cut in personal tax rates and strong retail demand
from East German residents. Both imports and exports were also up sharply,
22.3 and 36.9 percent, respectively.

IV-21
Industrial production (s.a.) fell 2 percent in April. The largest
component of the decline was a weather-related 15.2 percent drop in
construction activity. Industrial production excluding construction fell 1
percent in April to a level just 2.1 percent above where it was one year
earlier. The volume of new orders (s.a.) also declined in April, by 3.4
percent, all but erasing the sharp increase of the previous month. April's
decline was concentrated in foreign orders, which fell 8.6 percent. Average
new orders volume for March and April combined was 2.1 percent above the
level for January and February, but only 1.9 percent above the level of a
year earlier.
The unemployment rate (s.a.) remained at 7.3 percent in May, unchanged
since February. The rate of migration from East to West Germany slowed from
1,700 per day in the week prior to the East German election on March 18 to
300 per day in the last week of May. As of the beginning of June, over
184,000 immigrants from East Germany had arrived in West Germany since the
beginning of the year, and another 179,000 have arrived from other East
European countries.
Consumer price inflation (n.s.a.) on a 12-month basis declined from
2.7 percent in the first quarter to 2.3 percent in April and May. This
appears to be a delayed response to significant moderation in import,
wholesale, and producer prices that began in the fourth quarter. Wholesale
prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.3 percent in May, but were just 0.2 percent
above year-earlier levels. Producer prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.1 percent
in May, and on a 12-month basis were up only 1.5 percent. Import prices
(n.s.a.) fell 0.9 percent in May and were 5.4 percent below their year-
earlier levels. Wages and salaries per hour were 5 percent above year-
earlier levels in the first quarter, up from 3.6 percent in the fourth
quarter.

IV-22
In the first quarter, Germany's external surpluses increased sharply.
The current account surplus (s.a.a.r.) was $64 billion in the first quarter,
compared with $42 billion in the fourth quarter. However, the first quarter
surplus was still somewhat below the record level of one year earlier.
On June 21 the parliaments of East and West Germany approved a treaty
that sets the terms under which German economic and monetary union will be
established on July 1. The basic goal of the treaty is to introduce the
West German mark as the currency of East Germany, while at the same time
altering the institutional structure of the East German economy to make it,
as much as possible, similar to that of West Germany. The treaty has three
basic components. First, it sets the terms under which the West German mark
will replace the East German mark, including the rates of conversion for
financial assets and other contracts denominated in East German marks.
Second, the treaty lays out specific reforms in the fiscal structure of the
East German public sector and specifies how East German government deficits
will be financed. Third, it lays out a broad set of fundamental
market-oriented economic reforms that East Germany must implement.
The fiscal impact of the Treaty is likely to be significant. After the
initial conversion, government debt is expected to increase substantially,
due primarily to fiscal deficits of the East German central government. The
likely monetary impact of the treaty appears to be more modest. Under the
agreed terms of conversion, M3 will increase by about 10 percent, roughly in
line with the potential output of East Germany. No decision has yet been
made regarding how or whether the target for M3 growth in 1990 will be
adjusted after the German monetary union is established on July 1. (As of
May, M3 growth since 1989-Q4 (s.a.a.r.) was 4 percent, at the low end of the
Bundesbank's 1990 target range of 4 to 6 percent.) Although it appears
unlikely that monetary targeting will be given up all together, Bundesbank

IV-23
officials have indicated that the level of M3 will probably play a less
important role in short-run monetary policy decisions after July 1, due to
the inherent uncertainties in money demand. The Bundesbank is expected to
rely more heavily on leading indicators of domestic price pressures,
including the exchange rate.
Economic activity in France has slowed since mid-1989. Industrial
production (s.a.a.r.) fell 1.3 percent in the first quarter, and was up 2.1
percent on a 12-month basis. Growth of real marketable GDP (an early
indicator of total GDP that excludes part of the state-funded sector and
comprises about 85 percent of the total economy) slowed to 2.8 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter. Domestic demand continues to be paced by
gross fixed investment, which grew 9.1 percent. The external account has
shown signs of improvement, with real exports growing 13.4 percent.
Recent data for the United Kingdom show that stagflation continues to
beset the economy. Industrial production (s.a.), after falling in January
and February, rose in March and April but was still only 0.5 percent above
its level a year earlier. Real GDP growth (s.a.a.r.) rebounded somewhat in
the first quarter to 2.8 percent from 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter, but
the increase from year-earlier levels remained at 1.6 percent. After 44
consecutive months of decline, unemployment (s.a.) rose in April and May to
a rate of 5.7 percent.
Retail prices (n.s.a.) have risen sharply in recent months primarily
as a result of the institution of community charges and excise tax
increases. In May, the overall 12-month rate of retail price inflation was
9.7 percent, the highest since 1982. Excluding mortgage interest payments
and the poll tax, the "underlying" rate of inflation rose to 7 percent in
May. The government has stated that it will use the latter measure of
inflation (which is more comparable to those of other EC countries) in

IV-24
assessing whether U.K. inflation has fallen to European levels, the main
remaining condition for joining the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. In
May, output prices for manufactured goods (n.s.a.) rose 0.5 percent to 6.2
percent above year-earlier levels. In April the underlying 12-month
increase in average earnings remained at 9-1/2 percent.
In Italy, recent price data indicate continued slowing of inflation.
In May, the consumer price index (n.s.a.) was 5.7 percent above its level a
year earlier, down from 5.8 percent in the previous month. The wholesale
price index (n.s.a.) increased in April by 4.4 percent from its level a year
earlier, down sharply from the the 5.3 percent increase in March.
On May 18, the government introduced a supplemental budget intended to
reduce the projected 1990 budget deficit by $10 billion equivalent. The
expenditure measures, accounting for more than half of the proposed deficit
reduction, are mostly in the form of expenditure delays. The revenue
increases result from increases in excise and transaction taxes. However,
there are already indications that the measures contained in this package
will not be sufficient to reach the 1990 deficit target.
First-quarter national income data from Canada suggest widespread
weakness in economic activity. Although real GDP (s.a.a.r.) increased 2.2
percent, the same as the upwardly revised fourth-quarter figure, domestic
demand was significantly weaker in the first quarter. Growth in consumption
expenditures fell from 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter to 0.8 percent in
the first; private business investment in fixed capital fell from 9.3
percent to 1.1 percent. Inventory investment also was weak. Growth was
maintained by increases in government investment and by a substantial
increase in real net exports. Real imports fell 7.8 percent while real
exports rose 2 percent. Partial evidence from the second quarter suggests

IV-25
continued weakness. Unemployment (s.a.) rose from 7.2 percent in April to
7.6 percent in May.
Political uncertainty in Canada over the future of Quebec continues.
Two provincial legislatures failed to ratify the Meech Lake Accord, under
which Quebec would have joined the federal constitution, by its June 23
legal deadline. Quebec is currently negotiating with the Federal government
about repatriating control over immigration policy, but has not yet
officially raised the possibility of seceding from Canada.
Developments in East European Economies
On June 21, Hungary received a $280 million bridge loan from the Bank
for International Settlements. (The U.S. portion was $20 million.) Hungary
requested the loan after its international reserves fell precipitously as
foreign banks withdrew or did not renew lines of credit to the National Bank
of Hungary. First-quarter data indicate an improved trade and current
account performance by Hungary. A hard currency trade surplus of $350
million (against a projected surplus of $18 million) contributed to a hard
currency current account deficit estimated at less than $100 million
(compared with the 1989 first-quarter deficit of $669 million). Export
value of non-traditional exports (light manufacturing and high-technology
products) rose more than 20 percent. However, production levels are off,
and unemployment officially now exists (about 1 percent of the labor force).
Inflation is still running somewhat higher than the objective of 20 percent
for the year as a whole.
The Polish government declared that Poland's switch to a free-market
economy is complete, albeit imperfect, and that it is time to ease austerity
measures. This shift in policy is due, in part, to continued declines in
industrial sales (off 30 percent from a year ago) and increases in
unemployment (to about 3.8 percent of the labor force). However, inflation

IV-26
has not been beaten -- monthly inflation in May was about 5 percent (albeit
down from a monthly inflation rate of near 80 percent in January).
Private-sector development and restructuring of the state-owned sector
are moving slowly. Two large conglomerates have been broken-up -- one in
coal and steel and one in the transportation sector. The Gdansk shipyard
has been transformed into a joint-stock company in preparation for selling
shares to employees and investors. The first private bank in Poland has
been licensed; 10 Polish investors contributed paid-in capital of 10 billion
zloties (about $3 million).
Poland is negotiating with private and official creditors on its
proposal to reduce debt and debt service by about 80 percent. Last October,
Poland informed the commercial banks that they would receive only 15 percent
of interest due through end-1989 on the due date with the remainder after
six months with no penalties. Since the end of 1989, Poland has paid
interest on only short-term trade credits and on new bank debt. In
February, Polish authorities signed a generous "Paris Club" rescheduling
agreement with official creditors that covered $9.5 billion in debt payments
rescheduled over 14-years with an eight-year grace period.
U.S. Bank Lending to Foreigners
U.S. bank exposure to all countries, as measured by the Country
Exposure Lending Survey, declined 6.5 percent during 1989. As indicated in
the table, exposure to G-10 countries declined only slightly, with a small
increase in exposure by the money center banks more than offset by a small
decline among other banks. A decline in interbank exposure to Japan was
offset by increases to other industrial countries. Exposure to all other
regions also showed a decline, with the largest decrease associated with
developing countries.

IV-27
U.S. bank exposure to Latin American countries continued to decline in
1989, falling by 20 percent. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 1990
indicate a further decline in U.S. bank exposure of about 10 percent to
major debtors in Latin America. Mexico's financing agreement, completed in
March 1990, accounted for a portion of the decline as some U.S. banks
exchanged their debt for bonds discounted by 35 percent. Exposure to Brazil
also declined, consistent with reports that Brazilian public sector
enterprises have been repurchasing Brazilian debt on the secondary market.
Recent financing agreements negotiated under the Brady initiative
framework have resulted in the conversion of significant amounts of public
sector debt to banks into negotiable bonds. Most bank exposure to Mexico
and Costa Rica is now held in the form of negotiable bonds, and the
Venezuelan preliminary agreement also allows for the conversion of bank debt
into bonds. In addition to these debt-for-bond swaps, some Mexican public
and private sector entities have been able to return to the market with new
issues, albeit in small amounts. Also, several countries have indicated
that they will allow new bond issues to be used for financing privatizations
and other bank debt-for-equity arrangements. Such arrangements would
present further opportunities for banks to reduce their exposure by selling
their bonds to other investors willing to take equity positions in companies
in those countries.

Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
In Brazil, large wage increases and opposition to the government's
plans for substantial cuts in public sector employment are posing serious
challenges to the government's anti-inflation program. The government
has reacted to these inflationary pressures by threatening to restrict
monetary expansion at the cost of deepening the current recession. In an

IV-30
would be fired by the end of June from 360,000 workers (20 percent of the
public sector workforce) to between 120,000 to 200,000 workers; moreover, it
is not clear that the government will be able to come close to its goal.
Petrobras, the government monopoly in petroleum extraction, refining, and
distribution, was to have begun firing 20 percent of its estimated 65,000
workers by June 18, but so far few workers have been fired.
Serious opposition has also developed toward the government's attempt
to end wage indexation and reduce the state's role in propagating wage
inflation. In late May, the Supreme Court overturned a presidential decree
designed to limit the power of the courts to resolve wage disputes. In
recent weeks, regional labor courts have granted workers several large wage
increases ranging from 20 to 160 percent. The government has also announced
that wage increases resulting from collective bargaining agreements cannot
be passed through to prices, but it is not clear that this provision can be
enforced.
The government is threatening to curb wage demands by limiting
monetary expansion, at the cost of deepening the current recession;
dismissals of industrial workers in Sao Paulo during April were at their
highest level since 1981. Labor unions have organized strikes in several
areas recently, but strike activity has been limited by the current
recession and the threat of future layoffs. Despite recent setbacks to the
stabilization effort, interest rates and the parallel market exchange rate
have remained relatively stable in recent weeks; this stability, in part,
reflects government intervention to support the currency.
Brazil's monthly trade surplus was $1.8 billion in May, the largest
surplus this year. The accumulated five-month trade surplus to May 1990 is
$4.7 billion, compared with $6.9 billion over the same period in 1989.

IV-31
In Mexico, the rate at which the peso is being devalued daily against
the dollar was reduced to 80 centavos per day from 1 peso per day, effective
May 28. The change was made under an agreement extending the anti-inflation
pact between government, business, and organized labor through January 1991.
Contrary to expectations, the new agreement made no change in minimum wages
but raised a selective list of public sector prices by varying percentages.
Over a full year, measured from May 28, the new rate of crawl will raise the
peso price of the dollar by 10.4 percent, whereas the old rate would have
raised it by 13 percent. The government is taking the calculated risk that,
in the absence of an increase in minimum wages, the price level will
increase less than it otherwise would have and the real appreciation of the
peso in coming months will, therefore, not be larger than it would have been
with the old rate of crawl.
At the first Treasury-bill auction following the pact extension, the
28-day rate fell by about 3 percentage points. On June 19, this rate was
32.4 percent, more than 15 percentage points lower than at the most recent
peak in mid-March 1990. The bulk of the decline since mid-March reflects a
rise in public confidence in Mexican policies and prospects following the
March 28 implementation of the bank financing package and the May 2
announcement that the government was seeking to return the nationalized
commercial banks to private ownership. A constitutional amendment to
authorize the bank reprivatization was approved by the Mexican Congress in
May and awaits ratification by 17 of the 31 State legislatures.
Mexico has drawn all of the $1.3 billion in short-term bridge
financing provided on March 28 by the Federal Reserve System ($700 million)
and the U.S. Treasury ($600 million); $550 million of the bridge amount had
been invested initially in U.S. government securities until Mexico met

IV-32
certain conditions. As of June 26, Mexico had repaid about $564 million of
the credit.
Argentina has continued to implement the economic stabilization
program initiated in March, but inflation has not declined as rapidly as
anticipated. After falling from 95.5 percent (monthly basis) in March to
11.4 percent in April, inflation rose to 13.6 percent in May and is
projected at about 15 percent in June. The June increase is attributed, in
part, to an 8 percent increase in the austral price of the dollar during the
second week of the month; this depreciation reflected various factors,
including a correction of the substantial real overvaluation of the exchange
rate that had occurred during the previous three months. Financial markets
remain somewhat unsettled following the movement in the exchange rate, and
short-term interest rates currently are about 20 percent (monthly basis)
compared with about 10 percent during the first week of June.
On May 25, the IMF's Executive Board approved a modification of the
stand-by arrangement that was approved initially in November 1989 and became
inoperative after Argentina missed its December 1989 targets. The modified
program specifies deeper fiscal adjustments than the original program, and
also calls for the normalization of Argentina's relations with its
commercial bank creditors; interest arrears on Argentina's medium- and long-
term debt to commercial banks currently total about $6 billion.
To pave the way toward re-opening negotiations with the commercial
banks, Argentina paid $40 million in interest to them on June 7, the first
such payment since end-1988, and promised to continue payments of $40
million per month through the end of 1990; this compares with monthly
interest of $280 million that will accrue on its medium-and long-term debt
to commercial banks during this period. On the same day, Argentina met with
its bank advisory committee to discuss the normalization of financial

IV-33
relations, as well as the granting of waivers by the banks to allow the
privatization of Argentine public enterprises with debts to those
institutions. No resolution of either of these issues was reached at that
meeting, nor has an additional meeting been scheduled.
As of June 26, Venezuela and its commercial bank creditors were
completing the final details of a term sheet for the package to provide new
money and debt and debt-service reduction agreed in March. Following
distribution of the term sheet, creditors will choose among the available
options, including a provision for a large but temporary interest rate
reduction, an option not available in the Mexican debt agreement.
The limited monthly economic data available suggest that Venezuela's
sharp recession, which began last spring and entailed an 8 percent decline
in real GDP in calendar 1989, may have bottomed out. Cement sales were 30
percent higher in May than in April, mainly due to strong export demand,
while motor vehicle sales in May rose 41 percent above their April level.
Inflation has remained roughly stable at an average of 2.2 percent per month
during the first five months of this year, compared with an average monthly
rate of 5.1 percent in 1989. The Caracas CPI rose 2.5 percent in May, paced
by a 4.2 percent increase in food prices. To combat food-price inflation,
the government has extended its trade liberalization program to many
agricultural commodities.
When the Central Bank of Venezuela reduced short-term interest rates
during May in an effort to stimulate economic activity, the floating-rate
bolivar depreciated from 44 per dollar at end-April to 48 per dollar at end-
May. The central bank responded by reversing the decline in interest rates,
which stabilized the currency. In mid-June, the interest rate on three-
month central bank bills stood at 39 percent (annual rate, not compounded),
compared with 28 percent in mid-May.

IV-34
Costa Rica and its commercial bank creditors completed a debt
restructuring package on May 21, 1990, which will lower the stock of
commercial bank debt from $1.6 billion to $0.8 billion and reduce the
interest rate on most of the remaining debt to 6.25 percent. The package
lowers Costa Rica's annual debt service obligations on its commercial bank
debt by over two-thirds. Costa Rica bought back about 62 percent of the
base debt and past due interest at 16 percent of face value.
