The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The Commerce Department's advance estimates indicate that real GNP grew
at a 1-1/4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, and the available
evidence suggests continued slow growth in the current quarter. Labor
demand has been sluggish, but even so, wage increases have not abated. The
underlying inflation trend appears to have been no better than stable
through the first half of the year, and the recent oil price shock presages
some bad price figures in coming months. In addition, the steep rise in
energy prices is likely to result in a significant erosion of consumer
purchasing power.
Employment and Unemployment
Employment growth slowed substantially in the second quarter, and the
labor market continued to weaken in July. Nonfarm payrolls shrank 219,000
last month--pushed down, in part, by a 162,000 decline in Census employment.
Private payroll employment dropped 45,000, after small gains during the
second quarter.
The services industry lost 11,000 jobs in July, as employment declined
in business services and hiring slowed in health services. The pace of
hiring at retail and wholesale trade establishments also appears to have
slowed considerably in recent months. Construction employment fell in July
for the fifth consecutive month and has now more than retraced its winter
spurt. Manufacturing payrolls also declined further, albeit at a pace
slower than that over the first half of the year; all of the job loss in
July occurred among supervisory workers, while the employment of production
workers edged up. By industry, the losses in manufacturing last month were

concentrated in electrical machinery and construction-related industries,
such as lumber and stone, clay, and glass.
Although employment declined and the unemployment rate moved up to
5.5 percent in July, other data paint a more sanguine picture of underlying
labor market conditions. Hours of production and nonsupervisory workers
edged up in July to a level about 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate above the
second-quarter average. Also, data from the household survey indicate that
the number of recent layoffs as a percentage of employment fell last month.
Finally, initial claims for unemployment insurance have fluctuated around
the 350,000 to 360,000 per week average pace observed in the first half of
1990.
Labor Costs
As measured by the employment cost index (ECI), hourly compensation for
private industry workers rose 5-1/4 percent over the twelve months ended in
June--about 3/4 percentage point faster than over the comparable period in
1989.1 Wage and salary inflation edged up to a 4-1/2 percent pace over
the past twelve months from the 4 percent rate that had prevailed for nearly
2a year and a half. Benefit costs continued to increase faster than wages
and salaries. The 7 percent increase in benefit costs over the past twelve
1. The BLS recently has made available unpublished, seasonally adjusted
data for the Employment Cost Index on a confidential basis (table). These
data will be available officially in January 1991, with the release of data
for the fourth quarter of 1990. The new seasonally adjusted series do not
differ significantly from those produced in the past by Board staff. Hourly
compensation increased at a 5.1 percent annual rate in the second quarter,
as benefits decelerated to a 5.4 percent annual rate, while wages and
salaries increased at a 5.1 percent annual pace.
2. The April increase in the minimum wage from $3.35 to $3.85 per hour
appears to have had only a minor influence on average wages, even within the
service sector. According to the BLS, the ECI figures suggest that the
minimum wage increase added at most 0.1 percentage point to private sector
wage growth over the year ending in the second quarter.

months reflected, in part, a 12 percent increase in employers' health
insurance costs as well as increases in both the social security tax rate
paid by employers and the social security tax base.
By industry, hourly compensation in the goods-producing and the
service-producing sectors increased at about the same pace over the
12 months ended in June. Hourly compensation in the service-producing
sector has been rising at a bit above a 5 percent annual rate over the past
year, while hourly compensation costs in goods-producing industries have
accelerated from 3-1/2 percent to 5-1/4 percent over the same period.
In the union sector, hourly compensation rose a bit more than 4 percent
over the past 12 months, up a percentage point from the preceding year. The
acceleration in union wages also was apparent in the second-quarter data on
major collective bargaining agreements--those covering 1,000 workers or
more. The first-year adjustments in these contracts averaged 4-1/4 percent,
2 percentage points larger than in the agreements they replaced, most of
which had been signed two or three years ago.
Contract negotiations between the UAW and the Big Three automakers
began in mid-July. In early September, the UAW will target one of the three
firms and negotiate exclusively with that firm until a settlement has been
reached. Ford's strong economic position relative to Chrysler and GM would
seem to make it a likely choice as the target company. Executives at
Chrysler have indicated that they would like to be the target company in
order to pursue "innovative" discussions of a proposed multi-employer health
care trust as well as other issues. Despite Ford's and Chrysler's
positions, union members publicly are urging union leaders to select GM as
the target company. GM reportedly has angered UAW members by laying off

thousands of workers over the last three years, despite job security
measures negotiated under the 1987 contract.
Under the expiring UAW agreement, workers received a 3 percent wage
increase in 1987 and lump-sum payments in 1988 and 1989 equal to 3 percent
of the previous year's earnings. COLAs and profit sharing also boosted
autoworkers' earnings over the term of the last contract. The job security
program negotiated in 1987 was the centerpiece of the agreement and
guaranteed employment levels on a plant-by-plant basis. However,
automakers, particularly GM, circumvented this agreement by "indefinitely
idling" rather than permanently laying off workers. The union is
currently challenging GM in court.
Negotiations this year reportedly will focus on job security, COLAs for
pensions, outsourcing, wage increases, overtime reductions, and reductions
in overall work time. The last strike in the auto industry, which occurred
in 1976 against Ford, involved 166,000 workers and lasted approximately
three weeks.
At this point, information on wage developments in the third quarter is
limited to average hourly earnings for July, which increased 0.6 percent.
Sharp increases in services and finance, insurance, and real estate were
only partly offset by moderate gains in manufacturing and construction.
Over the past 12 months, this narrow measure of labor costs grew 4 percent,
as it has since mid-1988.
Industrial Production
Total industrial production, which had increased a total of 1 percent
over the preceding two months, was unchanged in July. Assemblies of both

autos and trucks fell back last month, after rebounding in May and June.
Excluding motor vehicles, total industrial output rose 0.2 percent in July,
continuing the 2-1/4 percent annual rate of growth that has persisted since
January.
In July, the gain in production outside of the motor vehicle industry
was concentrated in further increases in industrial materials. Gains were
spread among metals, paper, and chemical and energy materials. In contrast,
output of construction supplies declined further, consistent with the
weakness in building activity. Among final products, output of consumer
goods other than motor vehicles changed little in July, as drops in the
output of appliances and miscellaneous home goods largely offset small
increases in most categories of nondurable goods. Production of both
defense equipment and business equipment other than motor vehicles was
unchanged. Within business equipment, output of industrial equipment and
equipment used in commercial aircraft rose while production of information
processing equipment declined for a second month.
In the second quarter, total IP is now estimated to have grown at an
annual rate of 4.0 percent--boosted almost 2 percentage points by a rise in
assemblies of motor vehicles and parts. Increased production at industries
that supply materials to automakers likely contributed an additional
1 percentage point to total IP growth.
Capacity utilization in total industry declined 0.2 percentage point in
July to 83.4 percent. The rates for manufacturing and utilities declined,
while the rate for mining increased about 1 percentage point. The rise in
operating rates for mining reflected gains in production of coal, metal
ores, and crude oil. Within manufacturing, utilization in advanced

processing industries fell, while that in primary processing industries rose
slightly to 85.5 percent. Operating rates increased notably for pulp and
paper, petroleum refining, and steel in June and July.
Over the past year, capacity utilization trends have mirrored the
patterns in production. Manufacturing utilization fell 2-1/2 percentage
points between the second quarter of 1989 and January 1990. Since then the
factory operating rate has remained in a narrow range between 82.5 percent
and 83.0 percent. Aside from primary aluminum ingot, which is being
exported in volume, utilization rates for metals, paper, chemicals, plastics
and synthetic fibers, petroleum refining, lumber and stone, clay, and glass
are significantly below earlier cyclical highs.
The runup in crude oil prices, if sustained, is likely to result in an
increase in domestic exploration activity. As of July, 1,071 rotary rigs
were in operation in this country, up from a low of 870 last year but well
below the peak of almost 4,000 in 1981. Similarly, oil and gas well footage
drilled has recovered a bit from its 1989 trough but still is only one-third
of its pace in 1981. Industry contacts suggest that if crude oil prices
were to rise to about the $30 per barrel mark, rotary rigs in use might
increase to a bit more than 1,500 within 12 months. A lack of skilled labor
in the drilling and supplier industries is thought to be a constraint on the
rate at which exploration activity can be expanded.
Personal Consumption Expenditures
Total retail sales are estimated to have edged up 0.1 percent in July
in nominal terms according to the advance report from the Census Bureau. In
the control category, which excludes automotive dealers and building
material and supply stores, sales in July were essentially unchanged from

their June level. The July sales results were mixed across categories of
stores, with increases at food stores, general merchandise outlets, and
furniture and appliance stores offsetting declines at apparel stores, and at
miscellaneous other durable and nondurable goods stores. 4
The July retail sales report also contained large upward revisions to
the estimates for May and June. Growth in sales during those months now is
estimated at -0.2 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, a cumulative upward
adjustment of 0.9 percent. The revisions were concentrated among nondurable
goods stores and were especially large in dollar terms at food stores. For
the second quarter as a whole, previous estimates had shown a decline in the
retail control grouping of roughly 2 percent at an annual rate; the revised
data now show the second-quarter level as about unchanged from the first
quarter. This upward revision likely will be translated by the BEA into a
sizable upward adjustment in second-quarter real personal consumption
expenditures--perhaps as much as $6 billion, which would boost estimated
growth in total real PCE during the quarter from a decline of 1/4 percent at
an annual rate to an advance of about 1/2 percent.
Despite the upward revision to second-quarter PCE, we still expect the
revised data to show real outlays for goods declining during the first half
of 1990 at about a 1 percent annual rate. In contrast, outlays for services
are estimated to have grown so far this year at a 3-1/2 percent average
annual rate.

II-17
Autos and Light Trucks
In contrast to spending on other goods and services, demand for motor
vehicles has been well maintained so far this year, and apparently it firmed
a bit in June and July. Sales of domestically produced and imported autos
during the past two months averaged 9-3/4 million units, while sales of
light trucks averaged slightly more than 4-1/2 million units.
As of mid-July, 95 percent of vehicles sold by the Big Three automakers
were covered by incentive programs; the average value of the incentives per
vehicle was $1,010--nearly equal (in nominal terms) to the record-high
average for the third quarter of 1989. The low level of inventories
currently on hand suggests that the domestic automakers probably will not
have to sweeten current programs substantially to clear out 1990 stocks.
Indeed, inventories of domestically produced automobiles at the end of July
stood at an estimated 1.1 million units (BEA basis), the lowest level since
mid-1983. In recent years, the only time that automakers did not stage a
big end-of-model-year clearance sale was in 1988, when inventory
accumulation had been held in check by cautious scheduling of assemblies
after the 1987 stock market crash.
Although production schedules for the third quarter currently call for
a substantial increase in assemblies to 7.8 million units (BEA seasonals),
production was likely held down in August by a five-day walkout of workers
at a General Motors plant in Flint, Michigan, which ended this week.
Consistent with the corporation's move in recent years toward just-in-time
inventory control, the disruption in the supply of parts began almost
immediately to affect assembly operations, and, over the course of the

strike, total vehicle assemblies are estimated to have been reduced by about
300,000 units at an annual rate.
Business Fixed Investment
According to BEA's advance estimate, real business fixed investment
fell 6 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter--reflecting moderate
declines for both equipment and structures. Decreased purchases of
industrial equipment accounted for more than half of the second-quarter fall
in equipment spending, although almost every other major category of
equipment edged down as well. In nonresidential structures, office and
other commercial construction continued to fall in the second quarter, with
some offset from institutional building.
Although not as weak as last quarter's decline would suggest, the
underlying trend in investment is decidedly sluggish (chart). From the
second quarter of 1989 to the second quarter of this year, equipment outlays
posted no growth, as increases in spending on computers offset declines in
purchases of industrial equipment and motor vehicles. Similarly, second-
quarter outlays on nonresidential structures were essentially unchanged from
the level of a year earlier as modest gains in drilling and mining and
industrial building offset declines in the commercial sector.
Recent indicators suggest that business investment will continue to
post little or no growth in the near term. With regard to equipment, the
nominal value of orders for nondefense capital goods (excluding aircraft)
5. The recent revisions to shipments of nondefense capital goods during
May and June were small and suggest little change in BEA's estimate of PDE
spending in the second quarter. In contrast, construction put-in-place in
June was much stronger than BEA's assumption, and data for April and May
were revised up. This implies about a $2-1/2 billion upward revision to
real NRS in the second quarter, producing a growth rate of about 2 percent
at an annual rate.

fell 1-1/2 percent (not an annual rate) in the second quarter, after
increasing 1/2 percent in the first quarter. The second-quarter decline
reflected reduced nominal orders for virtually every type of nonelectrical
machinery, although in real terms, computer purchases are likely to rebound.
Moreover, outlays for aircraft should remain on an uptrend, providing some
support for gains in real equipment purchases in the current quarter.
Advance indicators for nonresidential structures paint a generally weak
picture. Construction permits and contracts have trended down during the
past year in most sectors (chart). Although office construction activity
reportedly rose in June, the sector remains quite weak. In contrast, the
Baker-Hughes count of oil and gas rigs in use is up significantly this year.
The outlook for increases in drilling activity over the near term is quite
favorable given the recent oil price developments.
In addition to the indicators discussed above, potential constraints on
both internal and external finance also may be affecting investment spending
in the near term. Growth in real gross business fixed investment and real
cash flow have moved together in recent years (chart), with cash flow
generally leading investment in the 1980s by one or two quarters. The
decline in internal cash flow during the past year likely has been a factor
restraining capital spending thus far in 1990, and is likely to restrain
expenditures in coming months. With regard to external finance, anecdotal
reports suggest cutbacks in lending for commercial real estate developments,
and construction put-in-place data for the second quarter indicate
reductions in building activity in this area. Outside of the commercial

construction sector, however, tightened lending standards or reduced
availability of external funds do not appear to have had a significant
effect on investment in the first half of this year.
Business Inventories
Business inventory investment was moderate in the second quarter, and,
at the current pace of sales, imbalances do not seem to be widespread.
Excluding retail auto dealers, manufacturing and trade inventories rose in
the second quarter at a $12.3 billion annual rate, a pace similar to the
average pace of stockbuilding in the first three months of 1990. The
inventory-sales ratio edged down to 1.45 months in the second quarter, at
the low end of the range over the past year. Nonetheless, there was
substantial variation in the pace of inventory accumulation over the course
of the second quarter, as manufacturing and trade stocks excluding auto
dealers fell at a $42.3 billion annual rate in current-cost terms in June,
after an average increase of about $40 billion in April and May.
In the retail trade sector, nonauto inventories fell at a $1.3 billion
annual rate in current-cost terms in June, following average increases of
about $13 billion per month in April and May. For the second quarter as a
whole, nonauto retail trade stocks increased $8 billion, with the bulk of
the increase occurring at stores that sell durable goods, food, and apparel.
With the gains in sales, stock-sales ratios dropped back in June after
widespread increases in April and May. On the whole, there did not appear
7. In its advance report of GNP, BEA assumed a $5 billion current-cost
increase in June in manufacturing and trade inventories excluding retail
autos. Based on the actual current-cost data, the staff expects a sizable
downward revision to nonfarm inventory investment (in constant dollars) in
BEA's preliminary GNP estimate for the second quarter.

to be serious imbalances in retail inventories at the end of the second
quarter.
In wholesale trade, machinery and miscellaneous nondurable goods
accounted for the bulk of the second-quarter accumulation. Because roughly
one-fourth of the machinery stocks at the wholesale level consists of
construction machinery, the accumulation of inventories in this category
may, in part, reflect the widespread weakness in the construction industry.
As for the diverse miscellaneous nondurable goods category, the rise in
stocks in the second quarter reversed declines during the previous two
quarters. Indeed, the level of wholesale nondurable miscellaneous stocks at
the end of June was little changed from a year earlier.
In manufacturing, inventory drawdowns in June (in current-cost terms)
more than reversed buildups in April and May. The bulk of the liquidation
occurred in stocks held by two key industries--machinery and transportation
equipment. Moreover, stage-of-processing data indicated that a significant
portion of the June reduction was in materials and work-in-process
inventories in the machinery industry. Given the relatively large
accumulation of machinery stocks at the wholesale level in April and May,
the runoff in the manufacturing sector in June may reflect some intended
inventory adjustments upstream in the overall channel of machinery
production and distribution. Thus far, there has been no evidence of excess
buildup of finished goods inventories in the manufacturing sector, and the
overall inventory-to-shipments ratio has continued to trend down (chart,
upper panel).

Housing Markets
Residential construction activity remained weak in June, as total
housing starts edged down further to an annual rate of 1.18 million units.
In the single-family sector, starts were about unchanged at 892,000 units in
June--despite a decline in mortgage interest rates during May. On the
demand side, sales of new homes increased somewhat in June, but remained at
a comparatively low level. The firming of sales resulted in some drawdown
in the stock of homes for sale; however, for the second quarter overall, the
weakness of sales caused the months' supply of new homes to rise to its
highest level since mid-1982.
More than likely, the reduced demand for single-family homes partly
reflects damped expectations of house price appreciation. The constant-
quality new home price index was about unchanged in the second quarter from
its year ago level. In June the average price of new homes sold (not
quality adjusted) was down slightly from its year-earlier level, while the
median price of new homes was up 6 percent. This pattern of larger
increases in median prices indicates that new home demand is relatively weak
in the upper part of the price distribution and is consistent with anecdotal
reports of weak sales and swollen inventories of homes for sale in that
8price range.
On a regional basis, new home sales in the Northeast were about
5 percent lower during the first half of 1990 than their 1989 average, while
sales declined 10 to 18 percent in other areas of the country. During the
same period, median new home prices increased 5 to 8 percent in the Midwest,
8. This pattern holds for each region as well as nationally. Therefore,
shifting geographic composition of sales does not account for the different
rates of increase in average and median prices.

II-30
South, and West but have fallen 4 percent in the Northeast. The weakness of
prices in the Northeast suggests that the relative stability of sales there
may reflect the price concessions being offered by builders to help reduce
bulging inventories of new homes.
In the multifamily sector, construction activity remained weak. Starts
dropped 9 percent further in June to 285,000 units--the lowest level since
early 1982. However, with multifamily construction slow for the past three
and one-half years, some progress seems to have been made toward working off
the persistent overstock of rental units. The vacancy rate for multifamily
rental properties during the second quarter declined almost 1 percentage
point to 8.5 percent.
Federal Sector
According to BEA's advance estimates, real federal purchases of goods
and services, excluding the CCC, rose at an annual rate of 5.4 percent
during the second quarter. Nondefense purchases grew at an annual rate of
11.7 percent during this period, owing partly to spending on the decennial
census. Real defense purchases increased more than 3 percent at an annual
rate. Increases in defense are not expected to continue, given that nominal
spending in this category is constrained by flat budget appropriations for
procurement and for operations and maintenance over the past five years.
"Operation Desert Shield" is expected to have only a small effect on defense
spending in the near term because it is composed mainly of personnel and
operations and maintenance expenditures that have already been incorporated
into this year's budget or can be accommodated by reallocating existing
outlay plans. As yet, no "imminent danger pay" has been authorized for the
vast majority of the military personnel involved in the operation.

II-31
In June, the federal government recorded an $11 billion deficit,
compared with an $8 billion surplus in the same month of 1989. Rising
payments by the Resolution Trust Corporation for the thrift bailout
accounted for the increase. For the October-to-June period, the deficit
stood at $163 billion, compared with $105 billion during the same period a
year earlier. The increase reflects sluggish receipts growth, surging
deposit insurance outlays, and growth in most other outlay functions with
the exception of defense and agriculture.
Net spending by the RTC totaled $23 billion in the second quarter,
compared with a $4-1/2 billion average pace during the previous two
quarters. The Oversight Board approved a $36 billion net spending plan
($41 billion in resolutions and advances less $5 billion in REFCORP
borrowing) for the July-to-September period to resolve another 77 cases.
Both RTC Chairman Seidman and Under Secretary of the Treasury Glauber have
suggested that RTC will hit its obligation limits in the fourth quarter. 10
The Office of Management and Budget released its Mid-Session Review of
the Budget showing a deficit estimate of $219 billion for FY1990--$161
billion excluding RTC (see appendix B for details). The GRH baseline
deficit estimate for FY1991 of $148 billion implies an $84 billion sequester
if no further legislation is passed by October 15, or roughly $100 billion
9. Deposit insurance outlays were $31 billion higher than a year earlier.
10. Under the currently implemented interpretation of FIRREA's "note cap"
provision, RTC is essentially required to keep a 15 percent capital cushion,
denominated in unused REFCORP funds, against working capital borrowing.
This requirement effectively prevents full use of the original $50 billion
spending authority and could stop RTC activity in early October if planned
third-quarter resolutions are carried out and Congress does not approve
additional budget authority.

if the Food Stamp program is reauthorized. 11 Most spending is protected
from sequestration by law, and the President has exercised his option to
exempt military personnel as well; thus, a $100 billion (7 percent) cut in
baseline outlays, if it were to occur, would make a sizable dent in affected
programs: Outlays of affected nondefense programs would be cut 38 percent
while affected defense accounts would be reduced 41 percent. Budget
negotiators made little progress before Congress adjourned, and none of the
thirteen regular appropriations bills that control discretionary spending
has been passed.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
were essentially flat in the second quarter, after having risen for three
years. During the second quarter, construction spending fell 9.5 percent as
highway construction declined substantially following the earthquake-related
surge last winter. Revenues appeared to have been little changed with both
sales tax accruals and federal grants declining. As a result, the deficit
of operating and capital accounts, which excludes social insurance funds, is
estimated to have widened further. As a share of state and local government
expenditures, the deficit currently stands in the range last seen during the
1973-1974 recession.
A recent survey by the National League of Cities suggests that local
governments, along with state governments, are facing more fiscal pressure
11. The GRH baseline deficit estimate essentially uses current laws to
estimate revenues and mandatory spending and estimates discretionary
spending by boosting FY1990 spending by the rate of inflation. The OMB
presented an alternative baseline that includes the reauthorization of the
Food Stamp program and RTC spending and adjusts for the end of the decennial
census. These adjustments yield an FY1991 deficit of $231 billion, or $169
billion excluding RTC.

than they did last year. The problems are widespread but appear to be most
severe in the Northeast. To cope with these pressures, many cities have
increased or implemented new fees and charges and raised property tax rates.
On the expenditure side, more than 50 percent of the cities have cut the
growth of operating outlays and nearly 40 percent have reduced the level of
capital spending. Even with these adjustments, 54 percent of cities,
compared with between 24 and 40 percent during the prior six fiscal years,
reported expenditures outstripping receipts in FY1990.
Energy Prices and Supplies
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait resulted in a significant runup in crude
oil prices. Although U.S. crude and product prices had been rising since
12early July following an OPEC accord to reduce overproduction, the recent
invasion so far has added $5.75 to both the spot and contract prices of West
Texas Intermediate crude oil (chart). On balance, spot and contract prices
of WTI have risen $10 and $9.50, respectively, since their trough in early
July.
These movements in crude oil prices already have resulted in a runup in
spot prices for gasoline and heating oil. Data from the most recent
Lundberg survey point to a substantial increase at the wholesale level in
August. While prices at the retail level usually lag wholesale prices by
about a month, surveys of gasoline stations by Lundberg and the AAA indicate
that retail prices nationwide rose 14 cents per gallon in the first two
weeks after the Iraqi invasion. Thus, the price response is occurring much
12. See the International Developments Section for the details of the July
OPEC accord.

faster than usual, and the surge in the consumer price index for energy is
likely to be spread over both August and September.
Prior to the OPEC accord and Iraqi invasion, energy prices were
weakening somewhat. In the July PPI, which was sampled in the second week
of the month, finished energy prices fell 0.5 percent. PPI gasoline prices
dropped 5.3 percent in July, reflecting the lagged response to earlier
declines in crude oil costs as well as some pickup in production after a
series of refinery shutdowns in the spring. However, this drop in gasoline
prices was partially offset by a jump in natural gas prices and a small
increase in the price of home heating oil. Energy prices also were down in
the July PPI at the intermediate and crude stages of processing.
The United States appears better prepared to weather a disruption of
crude oil supplies than it was in either 1973 or 1979. Although oil imports
have returned to 1979 peak levels, oil inventories, including the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, are significantly higher than in 1979. Privately held
inventories amount to about 65 days of supply, as in 1979, but the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve now adds another 35 days of consumption.
Food Prices and Agricultural Conditions
Food prices jumped 0.8 percent in the June CPI--after changing little
in April and May. Prices for fresh vegetables picked up substantially,
owing mainly to a sharp runup in tomato prices. In addition, the CPI for
meats, poultry, fish, and eggs rose 1-1/2 percent in June, and this index
now is 7 percent higher than a year earlier. Much of the recent increases
can be traced to farm prices for hogs, cattle, and poultry, which were quite
strong through June; however, farm prices for hogs and poultry have slipped
downward in recent weeks. Indeed, prices for finished consumer foods in the

PPI for July were flat, as substantial declines in prices for beef, pork,
and eggs offset a surge in fresh fruit prices. USDA production estimates
indicate that the trend in output of red meats should pick up in coming
quarters, and futures prices for cattle and hogs seem to corroborate a
general expectation of expanding supplies and falling prices near the end of
1990. In addition, broiler prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks,
reflecting a return of seasonal weather patterns in the Southeast which
reduced the production problems that were associated with excessive heat and
drought in June and July.
Developments in markets for the major grains help shape, to a large
degree, the longer-term outlook for livestock production, and according to
August estimates of production by the USDA (table), output of corn and
soybeans now is expected to be smaller than was indicated in June, prior to
the last Greenbook. This weakness reflects poor weather conditions in the
Cornbelt while the crops were being planted, as well as the hot, dry weather
in the South. In terms of months' supply of grain, inventories of both corn
and soybeans are near the low end of the range seen during the past decade.
As a result, prices of both crops have been particularly sensitive to
reports of crop conditions of late, and news of fluctuations in demand or
production prospects have caused considerable swings in farm prices for
grain. In contrast, wheat stocks now are rebuilding, and this year's bumper
crop in the United States, along with good harvests abroad, is depressing
prices.

Prices
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI advanced 0.4 percent in June.
Service prices rose 0.6 percent, boosted by a jump of about 1 percent in the
index for owners' equivalent rent. Prices of commodities less food and
energy edged up only 0.1 percent, despite a sharp increase for tobacco
products, owing to discounting for house furnishings, apparel, and motor
vehicles.
Over the first six months of the year, the CPI less food and energy
rose at a 5-3/4 percent annual rate, a percentage point or more above the
increases in 1988 and 1989. Prices of nonenergy services registered a
6-1/4 percent rate during the first half of the year, compared with 5 and
5-1/4 percent, respectively, in 1988 and 1989. This acceleration reflected
large increases for a variety of items, including airfares, cable
television, and medical, legal, and financial services. The index for
commodities less food and energy rose at a 4-1/4 percent rate through June,
up from the reduced 2-3/4 percent pace last year but not much above the 1988
increase of 4 percent. Apparel prices more than accounted for the
acceleration in this component.
Producer prices of finished goods excluding food and energy fell
0.1 percent in July following a 0.6 percent increase in June. Much of the
movement between these two months reflects swings in tobacco prices, which
are distorted by inappropriate seasonal factors. In addition, car prices
fell 0.5 percent in July, after a large runup in June, as the enhancement of
incentive programs more than offset announced increases in sticker prices on
1990 model vehicles. Prices of intermediate materials less food and energy

were little changed over the two months and have risen at about a 1 percent
annual rate so far this year.
More recently, however, prices on spot commodity markets have turned up
markedly for most industrial metals as well as for gold. Most of the
increases for industrial metals occurred before the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. The Journal of Commerce index for industrial metals (upper panel of
chart) moved back around its recent high reached early in April but
remained, nonetheless, below its levels during most of 1989. Supply
disruptions have contributed to upward pressures on some metals, notably
copper; and, according to market reports, world metal markets generally have
been supported by continued demand from Europe and East Asia. Prices of
steel scrap surged in late July and are currently just below their most
recent highs reached in 1988-1989. Although aluminum prices also turned up
sharply in late July, they have retraced just a fraction of their steep
decline from mid-1988 until early this year.

APPENDIX A
ANNUAL REVISION TO THE NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS
The Commerce Department released its annual revision to the National
Income and Product Accounts on July 27. This revision incorporated new
source data and revised estimates of seasonal factors back to the first
quarter of 1987. The new figures show that growth in real activity was
somewhat slower over 1987-89 than was previously estimated. Real GNP growth
was revised down 0.4 percentage point over 1987 and 0.8 percentage point
over 1989, while the estimate for 1988 was little changed. The revision did
not greatly affect BEA's estimates of inflation. The GNP fixed-weight price
index continues to show increases of about 4 percent over 1987 and 1989 and
about 4-1/2 percent over 1988.
With this revision, real growth over 1989 now stands at 1.8 percent.
A sharply lower estimate of real consumer spending accounts fully for the
downward adjustment to output growth last year. Most of the revision to
real PCE occurred in spending for services and reflected the results of the
Census Bureau's Service Annual Survey for 1989. This adjustment was
concentrated in medical care services, though there were smaller downward
revisions for various other nonhousing-related services. Outside the
consumer sector, revisions to spending growth last year were small on the
whole. For 1987, the lower estimate of real GNP growth reflects, in large
part, a downward adjustment to growth in business purchases of computing
equipment, along with smaller estimated increases in purchases by state and
local governments. State and local purchases were revised down in 1988 and
1989 as well, and the trend growth in this sector is now shown to have been
lower in recent years than previously estimated.
On the income side of the accounts, the most significant change was the
$58 billion downward adjustment to the level of wages and salaries in 1989.
The revised figure is based on fairly comprehensive tabulations of payroll2data submitted by firms to state unemployment insurance offices. As a
result primarily of the new figures on wages and salaries, disposable
personal income was revised down $53 billion last year. Because this
downward adjustment to income substantially exceeded that to personal
outlays, the estimate of the personal saving rate in 1989 was lowered
0.8 percentage point to 4.6 percent. This revision considerably mutes, but
does not eliminate, the pickup in the saving rate over the past two years.
Among other components of income, the level of corporate profits was raised
about $10 billion across the entire 1987-89 period. Accordingly, the share
of corporate profits (with the inventory valuation and capital consumption
adjustments) in nominal GNP was revised up 0.2 percentage point in each
year. However, this level adjustment did not alter the sharp decline in the
profit share over the four quarters of 1989.
1. Excluding the 1989-Q1 rebound in farm output from the 1988 drought,
real GNP growth over 1989 is only 1.3 percent.
2. The downward-revised level of wages and salaries suggests that
employment growth over 1989 may have been somewhat weaker than is now
reported in the BLS data on payroll employment. Revisions to the BLS
employment data will be available in early September.

APPENDIX B
MID-SESSION REVIEW OF THE BUDGET
The Administration has released its Mid-Session Review of the Budget.
The document contains new deficit estimates, which are substantially higher
than those presented in last January's budget; it also provides a
preliminary assessment of the sequester amounts that are required to meet
the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets for FY1991. The Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) has issued its usual summer report, The Economic and Budget
Outlook: An Update, as well; apart from spending by the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC), CBO's deficit projections for FY1990 and FY1991 are
similar to those of the Administration.
Near-Term Budget Developments and Prospects
The Administration now projects a baseline deficit of $219 billion in
FY1990, compared with a figure of $122 billion in the January budget
(table 1). Higher outlays by the RTC account for about half of the
increase. But the expected deficit excluding the RTC also has been raised
substantially; at $161 billion, it stands a bit above the actual deficits
that were recorded during FY1987-89. For FY1991, the Administration now
estimates the baseline deficit--including the reauthorization of the food

consolidated baseline deficit." The CBO baseline includes
"additional RTC spending needs." Both baselines include
the extension of the food stamp program, which is scheduled
to expire at the end of FY1990.

II-B-2
stamp program and full funding for the RTC 1 --at $231 billion; the deficit
excluding the RTC also is expected to edge up further.
As table 2 shows, OMB has raised its projections of baseline outlays
$68 billion in FY1990 and $96 billion in FY1991. The largest change is in
net outlays for the RTC, which are now expected to total $57 billion this
year and $63 billion next year; in the January budget, these outlays were
$2 billion and $7 billion respectively. A substantial rise in projected
interest outlays--especially in 1991--reflects the larger projected deficits
and higher interest rates (table 3), which now are assumed to be roughly a
percentage point above those in the January budget. Other notable upward
revisions this year are for defense, the financing of foreign military
sales, and the FDIC.
OMB has made a significant downward revision to its estimates of
receipts for this year and next--$29 billion and $35 billion respectively--
largely in response to the information on incoming collections. In
particular, the level this spring of final settlements of 1989 individual
income tax liabilities was lower than expected. The shortfall probably
reflects, in part, the lower level of personal income now estimated for
1989. (See Appendix A for a discussion of the revisions to personal
income.) But it also suggests that temporary phenomena were a bigger factor
in the strong final payments in early 1989 than had been thought previously
and hence that the permanent component was somewhat smaller. Moreover, OMB
has reduced its projection of corporate taxes, based not only on a
reassessment of the effects of tax reform but also on the lower profits now
expected for 1990 and 1991.
As noted above, the revisions to interest rates and to corporate
profits add significantly to the deficits in FY1990 and in later years.
Among other key economic assumptions, real growth this year has been slower
than OMB had forecast in January, and inflation has been more rapid. On the
1. Under current law, the food stamp program is scheduled to expire at the
end of FY1990. In addition, the estimates of RTC net outlays in the G-R-H
baseline are constrained by the $50 billion provided by FIRREA to cover
losses and by provisions limiting borrowing for working capital. The latter
will likely become binding within the next few months and would hold RTC
spending essentially to zero next year. Given the virtual certainty that
additional funding will be authorized for these programs, OMB provides some
alternative baselines, one of which includes the continuation of food
stamps, full funding for RTC, and other accounting adjustments and shows a
deficit of $231 billion in FY1991. CBO also offers an alternative baseline
(with "additional RTC").
2. Over the first three quarters of FY1990, net RTC outlays totaled
$32 billion, and for the July to September period, the Oversight Board has
approved a $36 billion net spending plan. For FY1991, the Administration
has developed three scenarios based on different assumptions for loss rates
and for the number of thrifts to be resolved. The estimated budget effects
in these scenarios range from $32 billion to $63 billion. OMB uses the
higher number, which is based on 1,027 failed thrifts and a "medium" loss
rate, in the adjusted baseline and policy estimates.

whole, however, the changes to the forecasts of real growth and inflation
are relatively small and thus have only a modest effect on the overall
deficit projection.
Apart from the RTC, the latest estimates from the CBO are similar to
those of the Administration. Its baseline deficit--excluding RTC spending--
edges up to around $160 billion in both FY1990 and FY1991, a bit above the
actual deficits of the past few years. CBO's figures show RTC spending in
FY1990 at only $36 billion; this estimate was developed in June and now
looks low in light of the sharp pickup in resolutions since late spring; its
RTC estimate for FY1991--$70 billion--is close to the Administration's.

3. OMB's July forecast anticipates a pickup in real activity in the second
half of 1990, while prices are expected to rise less rapidly than in the
first half. In the past few weeks, however, private forecasters generally
have raised their inflation projections and have become more pessimistic
about the outlook for real GNP.

II-B-5
The President's Deficit-Reducing Proposals
The Mid-Session Review also presents the outlook for the budget on the
assumption that the deficit-reducing measures presented by the
Administration to the Budget Summit on June 20 are enacted. As table 4
shows, these measures add $12 billion to the proposals outlined in the
January budget and bring the Administration's total package for 1991 to
$53 billion. Nonetheless, the resulting deficit--assuming full funding of
the RTC--would still be more than $100 billion above the GRH target.
The Administration's June proposals include $7 billion of reductions in
defense spending in FY1991. Recent events do not rule out the prospect of a
cut of about that size. However, they clearly lessen the odds that
significantly larger reductions--such as those proposed earlier by some
members of the Congress--will be enacted this year.
GRH Accounting: RTC and the Size of a Possible Sequester
The ultimate size of a sequester will depend, of course, in part on how
the Congress decides to modify the GRH calculations, as well as on spending
and tax actions taken between now and mid-October. In presenting its
sequester calculations, the Administration assumes that RTC spending will be
excluded from the baseline totals--in part because current law limits RTC
spending and in part because many believe that RTC expenditures should be
excluded from Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) sequester calculations. With this
assumption, the baseline deficit will be $169 billion--if, as seems likely,
the food stamp program is reauthorized. The Administration will issue an
initial sequester report on August 25 and a final report on October 15. If
no deficit-reducing actions are taken and the GRH procedures are not
modified before the final report is released, a sequester of roughly $100
billion will be required.
The cuts would fall primarily on defense and on nondefense
discretionary programs. Under the GRH law, Social Security and many other
benefit programs, as well as net interest and outlays from commitments
already in place, are exempt from the sequester; cutbacks also are limited
in several nonexempt programs, notably Medicare, Stafford student loans, and
veterans' medical care. Thus, the sequester would be concentrated on a
relatively small portion of the budget. A sequester of $100 billion, which
would be split equally between defense and nondefense programs, would impose
across-the-board cuts of 38 percent on affected nondefense programs. The
President has exercised his option to exempt military personnel from the
4. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act provides for the expedited consideration
of a joint resolution suspending the act in the event that (1) the
Department of Commerce reports real GNP growth of less than 1 percent at an
annual rate during the immediately preceding two quarters or (2) either CBO
or OMB projects that real GNP will decline for two consecutive quarters. A
joint resolution must be passed by the Congress and signed by the President.
However, a final sequestration order issued before the enactment of a joint
resolution is not suspended.

II-B-6
sequester; as a result, cuts in the rest of the defense budget would reach
41 percent.
The Long-Run Budget Outlook
As tables 5 and 6 show, the Administration and CBO both expect the
baseline budget to remain in substantial deficit through the mid-1990s. The
Administration now projects the baseline deficit (excluding the RTC) to fall
only to about $100 billion in FY1995, in contrast to the small surplus shown
for that year in the January budget. CBO, using less favorable economic
assumptions (table 7), expects the deficit (excluding the RTC) to remain
above $150 billion through FY1995.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Financial markets experienced some notable turbulence as the
intermeeting period unfolded, with investors responding first to a System
easing move, next to soft economic data and finally to the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. On July 13, the System acted to offset an apparent crimp in credit
availability by easing reserve market conditions; short-term rates quickly
incorporated the resulting 1/4 percent decline in the federal funds rate,
and bond yields eased a bit. Bond yields backed up after a disappointing
report on consumer prices, but rates fell across the maturity spectrum later
in July, when the release of data on second-quarter GNP and revisions to GNP
estimates for earlier quarters provided fresh evidence of a weak economy.
Market conditions changed dramatically in the wake of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait on August 2. Short-term rates dropped further, with Treasury
bills benefiting from a "flight to quality" and from the perception that
higher energy prices might tip the economy into recession. Bond yields
surged, however, as investors reassessed the inflation outlook. In
addition, hopes for a budget compromise faded as market participants
perceived that the combination of a weaker economy and higher gasoline
prices might make it more difficult for policymakers to reach agreement on
steps to achieve significant deficit reductions. With the inflation outlook
less favorable and more uncertain, the yield curve has steepened
significantly (chart); implicit forward rates for three years and beyond
have risen by 1/2 to 3/4 of a percentage point. On balance, the thirty-year
bond rate is up nearly 40 basis points since the July FOMC meeting, while
bill rates are down about 25 basis points.

After recording new highs early in the intermeeting period, equity
prices began to retreat late in July in response to weak second-quarter
earnings reports and economic data suggesting a torpid economy. Selling
pressures intensified in the first week of August as the market concluded
that the sharp rise in oil prices would depress future corporate earnings
and prevent interest rates from falling. Price declines were quite steep at
times, triggering price limits on stock index futures as well as program
trading restraints in the cash markets. Equity prices managed to recover
from their lows, but most major indexes remain about 5-1/2 percent lower
than they were at the time of the July FOMC meeting.
M2 expanded at only a 1 percent rate last month, moving near the lower
bound of its annual target range. Total core deposits remained quite weak
as the restructuring of the thrift industry continued to weigh on the
aggregates. M3 was again flat in July, as bank credit slowed and thrifts
apparently continued to pare their balance sheets. The latest data suggest
some strength in M2 in early August, including a boost in the second week of
this month from the transfer of balances from stock and bond funds to money
funds.
Private credit market borrowing apparently tailed off last month.
Business loans and outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial firms
contracted in July, and bond issuance slumped after a surge in June. State
and local governments cut back on their security offerings, while available
data suggest that both consumer credit and mortgage credit were soft again
last month. By contrast, the federal government has been borrowing heavily
in the third quarter, largely driven by funding needs to close ailing
thrifts.

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Growth in Ml and M2 remained sluggish in July, continuing the trend of
recent months. M1 was virtually unchanged in July and M2 expanded at only a
1 percent clip. The continued lethargic growth of these aggregates in July
owes, in part, to an innovative funding strategy
that pared 3-1/2 percentage points off Ml growth and 1 percentage point off
M2 growth.
In early
July, the subsidiary banks began to sweep funds out of NOW accounts each day
and place them with a nonbank affiliate; the funds were then returned to the
banks in the form of large time deposits, with lower reserve requirements.
The maturities of the time deposit contracts were staggered so as to cover
daily checks drawn against the OCDs. The transfer of funds from OCD
accounts to large time accounts had no effect on M3, which grew at an annual
rate of 1/4 percent in July, about in line with its recent behavior.
Growth of M2 in July continued to run well below staff econometric
forecasts. These forecasts, based primarily on income and opportunity
costs, began overpredicting M2 growth in the second quarter. Spreads
between yields on six-month Treasury bills and CDs, shown in the
accompanying chart, have narrowed in recent months, especially at thrifts,
where higher relative rates may be symptomatic of the suspension of RTC
efforts to replace high-cost thrift deposits. However, households typically
respond with a lag to changes in the opportunity costs of holding retail
deposits, and staff models suggest the rise and subsequent fall of deposit
opportunity costs since late last year provided little net boost to M2 in
July. The weakness in M2 in recent months has coincided with continued

strong demand in noncompetitive tenders for Treasury securities. The
strength in noncompetitive tenders has been more than would normally be
expected given prevailing rate spreads, perhaps signalling reduced demand
for retail deposits in M2. Preliminary data for August show some rebound in
M2, partly owing to narrower opportunity costs, but also to a surge in M2
money funds fueled by transfers from stock and bond funds.
M3 was flat in July, despite a pickup in institutional MMMFs,
reflecting some slowing in bank credit and an apparent further retrenchment
of thrifts. The continuing slide in M3 has placed it at the 1 percent lower
limit of its new annual target range. The runoff of managed liabilities at
thrifts accelerated somewhat in July, and abstracting from the
effects of action, managed liability growth remained tepid at
commercial banks. Weak credit demands, tight credit standards on some types
of bank loans, and rapid inflows of deposits from thrifts have reduced
banks' need for managed liabilities. So far this year, banks have funded 85
percent of their total credit growth with retail deposits, about double the
proportion of recent years.
Bank credit growth in July continued to show the effects of restraint
in the supply of credit and subdued demand, expanding at an annual rate of
5-1/2 percent. Much of the July increase in bank assets can be attributed
to a jump in security loans at several large banks and to the transfer of
real estate loans to banks by the RTC at the beginning of the month. Apart
from the RTC real estate loan transfer and the continuing popularity of home
equity lines, real estate credit was softer in July, reflecting the
depressed residential and commercial real estate markets. Consumer loans
continued to contract, largely because of an increased pace of

securitization. Securitization of consumer loans has been trending up for
some time, as some banks have sought to reduce assets in order to meet the
new risk-based capital standards. Even adjusting for securitizations,
however, bank loans to consumers remained soft in July, likely owing to
continued restraint in household credit demands.
Business loans contracted in July, with weakness especially pronounced
at small banks and in the Northeast, Southeast, and Southwest. An August
survey of senior loan officers at large banks revealed a further tightening
of credit standards for business borrowers since the last survey in May,
which had already pointed to some firming of standards for midsized and
smaller firms. Over 40 percent of the respondents reported that they had
applied tighter standards to applications from midsized firms for non-
merger-related loans, while about one-third reported tighter standards for
larger and smaller firms. Terms on credit extensions were also tightened,
with a sizable minority of respondents reporting they had cut the maximum
size of credit lines and increased their cost, raised spreads of loan rates
over base rates, and imposed more stringent loan covenants and more
extensive collateral requirements. The survey also addressed, for the first
time, lending practices at U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks.
About 60 percent of these respondents reported that they had tightened
standards for nonmerger credits to U.S. businesses during the last six
months.
In response to the more cautious bank lending posture, businesses
apparently have been seeking credit from other sources or applying for loan
guarantees. For example, business loans at finance companies increased at a
26 percent annual rate in June and 15 percent in the second quarter, far

outstripping growth at banks. The Small Business Administration has
recorded a pickup in the demand for its loan guarantees in recent months,
suggesting that some small business borrowers may be coping with
availability constraints by seeking credit enhancements.
Business Finance
Borrowing in the commercial paper and bond markets by nonfinancial
firms paralleled the lagging growth in business credit at banks. Gross
public bond issuance in July fell to its slowest pace of the year, and
commercial paper also ran off. The fall in commercial paper outstanding may
be due partly to the delayed effects of the June surge in bond issuance,
when several firms saw the drop in long-term yields as an opportunity to
substitute bonds for short-term debt.
Concerns about credit quality have continued to loom large in
securities markets. Downgrades exceeded upgrades by more than 6 to 1 in
dollar terms in the second quarter. Nationwide, commercial real estate
difficulties and regional residential property problems have helped spur the
downgradings of many banks. In the nonfinancial sector, downgrades were
concentrated among speculative-grade issues.
Even more creditworthy borrowers have been subject to closer scrutiny
by the market. For example, rate tiering in the A2/P2 commercial paper
category has become more marked, with lower quality paper reportedly trading
at rates up to 15 basis points higher than more desirable A2/P2 issues. 1
This has been due in part to increasing concern about possible defaults.
The same concern led the SEC to propose a rule restricting money fund

ratings ranging from A+ to BBB. Nearly 15 percent of total commercial paper
outstanding falls in the A2/P2 category.

III-12
ownership of A2/P2 paper to 5 percent of total assets. Currently, money
funds face no restrictions on total holdings of A2/P2 paper, although they
may not hold lower-rated securities. Money funds have reportedly become
selective in purchasing A2/P2 paper. However, because money fund holdings
of A2/P2 paper appear to be relatively small, their reduced presence in the
A2/P2 market should not by itself create funding problems for issuers. In
the below-investment-grade bond market, there were some encouraging
developments, including the steps announced by RJR to buy back some of its
junk bonds and by Columbia Savings and Loan to sell its large junk
portfolio. The spread between high-yield bonds and the 10-year Treasury
note rate narrowed a bit as a result. Issuance of new junk bonds remained
negligible throughout July.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms remained quite strong in
July. Initial public offerings exceeded $1 billion, the largest figure for
the year, as many high-tech firms took advantage of the high level of stock
prices in July to go public. However, the recent steep declines in stock
prices chilled the new issue market, reportedly resulting in the
postponement of several planned issues.
Thrift Industry Developments
First-quarter losses for nonintervened thrifts fell sharply from the
last quarter of 1989, driven largely by reduced loan-loss provisions.
However, loan-loss provisions tend to be larger at year-end, so the
improvement in earnings may be illusory. Compared to the first quarter of
1989, provisions for loan losses were up slightly. Total assets declined
about 1 percent during the quarter, contributing to a small improvement in
the ratio of tangible capital to assets. Thrifts likely continued to shed

III-13
assets at a rapid pace in the second quarter, judging by the sizable runoffs
of thrift liabilities.
Because complete data are not yet available, the overall performance of
thrift earnings in the second quarter is hard to discern. Several
California institutions have released second-quarter reports that indicated
relatively healthy earnings, but the trend in loan-loss provisions among
them is disturbing. Losses at Coast Savings, HomeFed, CalFed, and Great
American Bank were driven mainly by large loan-loss provisions for loans on
real estate in Arizona and Texas, but problems on California loans have
begun to surface. As much as 37 percent of HomeFed's nonperforming assets
are now in California, and CalFed cited a deterioration in its California
loan portfolio as the main reason for its loss. H.F. Ahmanson, widely
considered the healthiest thrift in the country, also experienced an
increase in nonperforming loans on California real estate. While the
California market is still considered strong relative to the rest of the
nation, these increases in nonperforming loans and similar experiences at
California banks have raised questions concerning the underlying strength of
the state's real estate market.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
Staff projections put the third-quarter federal government deficit at
about $60 billion, bringing the total for the fiscal year to a record $223
billion. RTC's third-quarter needs for working capital are estimated at $34
billion, although its outlays to this point in the quarter amount to only
about $5 billion. The Treasury is expected to finance the deficit with a
record $68 billion of marketable borrowing in the third quarter, including
$32 billion in the bill market and $36 billion in the coupon market. The

gross sizes of the weekly bill auctions have already crept up over the
intermeeting period from an average of $17.2 billion to $18.4 billion, while
the auction sizes of other issues have been boosted as much as $1 billion.
Results of the Treasury's August midquarter refunding were mixed, with the
three- and ten-year note issues meeting a cool reception, while the thirty-
year bond sold surprisingly well, contributing to a brief 12-basis-point
rally in the market.
REFCORP returned to a thirty-year maturity in its July auction. The $5
billion offering came at a 38-basis-point spread over the thirty-year
Treasury bond, about 10 basis points higher than the spread for the original
$4-1/2 billion thirty-year REFCORP bonds auctioned in October 1989.
Overall, however, spreads for the agency market remained tight as total
agency debt outstanding has grown slowly. The total debt of government-
sponsored enterprises increased only $10 billion over the last four
quarters, about $25 billion lower than the pace in the preceding few years.
Much of this slowdown is due to the decline in Home Loan Bank debt
outstanding, which stemmed from paydowns of advances by thrifts.
In recent weeks, the Student Loan Marketing Association has suffered
from its relationship to the troubled Higher Education Assistance Foundation
(HEAF). 2 About $2-1/2 billion of Sallie Mae's $16 billion loan portfolio
is guaranteed by HEAF, and Sallie Mae has extended about $800 million in
2. HEAF is one of the largest of 47 state and nonprofit agencies that
insure Guaranteed Student Loan Program loans, insuring about 10 percent of
the $50 billion in loans outstanding. In case of losses, the guarantor
agencies have recourse to the Department of Education at a rate dependent
upon the loss rate of the guarantor agency's loan portfolio. The higher the
loss rate, the lower the reimbursement rate from the Department of Education
on any nonperforming loans. HEAF's loss rate entitles it to only 80 percent
reimbursement of its losses.

III-16
loans to HEAF and HEAF-related entities. However, Sallie Mae reportedly
believes its risk of loss is minimal because its HEAF loans are fully
collateralized, and the Department of Education has recently reaffirmed its
backing of HEAF guarantees. The market, though, is still wary; spreads on
Sallie Mae's debt have widened about 5 basis points, and its stock price is
down 18 percent since HEAF's difficulties came to light.
Concerns about government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) prompted the
Treasury to submit a proposal at the ongoing budget summit negotiations that
would require GSEs to obtain a triple-A debt rating by at least two
nationally recognized rating agencies. The ratings are to be based solely
on the GSEs' financial health without reliance on implicit federal
guarantees or other advantages of agency status--a more stringent standard
than was proposed in the Treasury's May GSE report. GSEs failing this test
within a prescribed period would be subject to restrictions and oversight by
the Treasury.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term tax-exempt securities is estimated to have
slackened in July from its strong June pace. Offerings to finance new
capital expenditures and to refund outstanding debt were both off. Short-
term volume, which had been boosted in June by New York State's heavy
issuance, returned to a more normal level in July but may jump again in
August as California recently announced plans to issue $4.1 billion in
short-term debt.
The credit quality of municipal issuers deteriorated further in the

downgrades were especially widespread among housing issues, owing to a
decline in the ratings of banks providing credit support.

p--preliminary.
The Congress recently amended federal legislation to allow issuers of
tax-exempt securities to invest a sizable proportion of proceeds in taxable
securities for more than two years. As a result, tax-exempt entities
undertaking construction projects have a much stronger incentive to issue
tax-exempt bonds in advance of the projects' completion dates in order to
earn arbitrage profits. California, the largest of these issuers, has
already announced its plans to pursue this strategy, and other states are
expected to follow suit.
Mortgage Markets
Available indicators suggest that mortgage borrowing remained subdued
in July. Growth of real estate loans at commercial banks decelerated after
allowance for transfers of mortgage assets in thrift resolutions. Sharp

declines in thrift liabilities continued last month, suggesting that thrifts
further pared their mortgage assets.
Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages have generally trended lower
relative to Treasuries in recent months (chart), partly reflecting a sagging
demand for credit in the housing sector. Issuance of fixed-rate mortgage-
backed pass-throughs (table) has remained strong, however, as FRMs have
accounted for about 70 percent of new mortgage production in recent months.
ARMs, meanwhile, accounted for 32 percent of all conventional home
loans closed in June, up a bit from the May level. In contrast with fixed-
rate mortgage pricing, spreads between ARM rates and short-term Treasuries
widened slightly over the intermeeting period. ARM rates respond to short-
term Treasury yields with a lag and yields on short-dated Treasuries dropped
sharply in recent weeks, responding to the System easing in mid-July and the
unsettling movements in equity and bond prices in early August. In
addition, initial rate discounting of ARMs has moderated in recent months,
probably because banks are concerned about the creditworthiness of loan
applicants and perhaps because they feel less competitive pressure.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit grew less than 1 percent at an annual rate
in June, holding its second-quarter growth to a 2-1/2 percent pace. This
performance marked little increase over the first quarter, so that the first
half of 1990 was the weakest two-quarter period since 1980.
Automobile credit accounted for most of the drag on installment credit
growth, both in June and in the second quarter, reflecting the modest pace
of retail sales at auto dealers over the same period. While the sales and
credit series often diverge on a month-to-month basis, partly because of

lags between the recording of an auto sale and the booking of the related
loan, they track fairly closely over a longer period. Last year, dealer
sales slid to a 1-3/4 percent rate of growth, a pace at least two-thirds
slower than in any of the previous six years. Auto credit experienced a
similar slowdown, expanding only 1-1/4 percent during the year (see table).
The story in 1990 is much the same. Sales have declined on balance over the
first half of the year, and auto credit at midyear had contracted about 1
percent since year-end.
Revolving credit remained the strongest component of consumer credit,
although June's 7-1/2 percent pace was less than half the rate recorded in
May and well below that of recent years. Robust growth recorded in April
and May kept revolving credit climbing at a 12 percent rate during the
second quarter, up from 10-1/2 percent in the first.
The meager advance in consumer credit this year appears generally
consistent with the pattern of consumer spending (see chart). In the early
stages of an economic expansion, growth in consumer credit typically
outstrips the growth in spending, then gravitates toward the spending path
as the expansion matures. This pattern of initial fast growth in credit and
subsequent moderation reflects two major factors. First, spending on
durable goods, the element of consumption most closely related to consumer
borrowing, is generally a higher proportion of total spending early in the
expansion than it is later. Second, the stream of debt repayments is
relatively small at the outset of an expansion, reflecting the lower levels
of borrowing in the previous recession. As the expansion matures,
repayments accelerate and serve as a larger offset to new borrowing, thereby
slowing the growth of the debt stock.

III-24
The use of home equity lines of credit to finance consumer outlays has
also damped the growth of consumer credit during the past few years,
possibly trimming its rate of growth by 1 to 2 percentage points. At banks,
borrowing against home equity lines through July of 1990 has been growing
about 20 percent at an annual rate, bringing the total amount of home equity
credit to $55 billion at banks and possibly as much as $100 billion at all
lenders. Some banks have been tightening standards for granting home equity
lines and offering less liberal terms, particularly in the Northeast where
real estate values have weakened and delinquency rates have risen on home
equity lines (see table). However, the pinch of tighter rules appears to
have been relatively modest and the stricter guidelines are likely to exert
little restraining effect on already existing accounts. Household surveys
taken last year indicated that one in five line holders had not drawn
against their lines at the time of the survey. Moreover, those who had
tapped their lines had used only 40 percent of their lines on average. As a
result, there appears to be ample scope for home equity credit to continue
its recent rapid growth despite tighter lending standards.

The deficit on merchandise trade increased slightly in May to $7.7
billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis), from the revised $7.3 billion
deficit recorded in April. Increases in non-agricultural exports in May
were more than offset by increases in imports of oil and non-oil products.
Trade data for June will be released on August 17 and will be reported in
the Greenbook supplement.
Oil imports increased slightly in May, as a surge in quantity was
partly offset by a fall in prices. The increase in the quantity of imported
oil resulted from further additions to oil stocks, since consumption was

about unchanged from the beginning of the year. The decline in oil prices
during May continued the downward trend that began early in the year,
reflecting strength in OPEC production. From May through early July, the
spot price of West Texas Intermediate declined from $18.24 to $16.50 per
barrel, with OPEC showing little inclination to limit the flow of oil.

Oil prices reversed their decline in the middle of July, when the
Persian Gulf OPEC producers announced an informal production agreement that
became a formal OPEC accord in late July. The agreement called for
production restraint of 1 mb/d relative to July rates of crude production
(23.2 mb/d); this brought the spot price of West Texas Intermediate close to
$19 per barrel by July 12th. The price increased a further $2.50 per barrel
in response to threats from Iraq and movement of Iraqi troops towards the
border with Kuwait. Following the invasion of Kuwait, oil prices peaked at
nearly $30 per barrel on August 7. Over the past week, prices have settled
at roughly $26.50 per barrel as tensions in the Middle East continue.
The trade deficit continued to narrow in April/May, improving by
roughly $9 billion on a balance of payments basis from the first-quarter
deficit. The improvement in the April/May balance relative to the first
quarter was due entirely to the significant decline in the value of oil
imports that more than offset lower agricultural exports. Declines in
shipments of wheat, corn, soybeans, and cotton were responsible for the drop

IV-3
in agricultural exports during April/May. A small decline in exports of
nonagricultural products was about offset by a decline in imports of non-oil
goods.
While there were essentially no changes in the composition of non-oil
imports from the first quarter to April/May, there were some shifts across
the categories of nonagricultural exports. Automotive exports increased

declines in the prices of non-oil industrial supplies and automotive
products. Prices of imported capital goods also dropped slightly. The
small decline in non-oil import prices in the second quarter resulted partly
in response to an appreciation of the dollar against the Japanese yen that
was largely offset by depreciation against other currencies.
Prices for U.S. exports increased 1.4 percent in the second quarter,
led by increases in agricultural prices. Prices of exported corn and
soybean rose significantly, and cotton prices edged up slightly. For non-
agricultural exports, increasing prices for capital goods, automotive
products, and consumer goods were largely offset by a decline in prices of
industrial supplies.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Available data for the second quarter indicate that net private
capital outflows exceeded net official inflows by almost $4 billion. While
these data do not include direct investment flows and are subject to
revision, it is likely that recorded capital inflows for the quarter will be
quite modest in relation to the current account deficit, resulting in a
large positive statistical discrepancy. The statistical discrepancy in the
first quarter was also very large and positive.
One partial explanation for the large positive statistical discrepancy
this year is the rapid increase in currency held by foreigners. Reports
from several large U.S. currency shippers indicate net currency shipments
abroad totaled $3-3/4 billion in 1989, about one-half of which occurred in
December. In the first half of 1990, these banks report net shipments of
$6-3/4 billion. Since the Department of Commerce makes no attempt to
estimate currency flows in the international transactions accounts, these
outflows necessarily contribute to a positive statistical discrepancy.

IV-7
Private net purchases of foreign securities by U.S. residents
accelerated in May and June, bringing the total net purchases for the
quarter to $11-1/2 billion (line 2c of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table). The pick-up from April was primarily in net purchases
of foreign stocks. In May, stock purchases were concentrated in Japan, as
U.S. residents rebuilt their portfolios after reducing them in March and
April, coincident with the break in the Japanese stock market. In June, net
purchases of foreign stocks were concentrated in the United Kingdom,
although net purchases of Spanish stocks were almost $1/2 billion. U.S.
residents on net sold German stocks in May and June, reversing the sizable
purchases in the first quarter.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds picked up in May and
accelerated further in June (line 2a). This increase accompanied an
increase in new issues in the domestic market and a surge in Euromarket
offerings by U.S. firms. Private foreigners continued to sell U.S. stocks
in May and June, bringing the net sales for the second quarter to $3-1/4
billion.
Foreign purchases of Treasury obligations rebounded in May and rose
further in June. Italian residents purchased more than $2 billion in
Treasuries in May. Japanese residents also registered large purchases of
Treasuries in May ($3-1/2 billion), but sold Treasuries in April and June;
this pattern coincides with Treasury's refunding schedule for long-term
bonds. For the second quarter as a whole, Japanese residents sold $3-1/4
billion in Treasuries, accelerating the trend of net sales evident since the
fourth quarter of 1989. Net purchases in June were concentrated in Mexico
and the United Kingdom.
Official inflows (line 4) resumed in June as G-10 countries increased
their assets in the United States by $2 billion. Other European countries

also registered inflows, bringing the total net inflow from Europe to $5-1/2
billion. Offsetting this was a $4-1/2 billion decrease in official holdings
by Taiwan
Banks reported net outflows of $12-1/2 billion in June, reversing the
inflow recorded in May and bringing the net reported outflow for the second
quarter to $4-1/2 billion (line 1). Most of the outflow in June was
associated with an increase in net claims on foreign affiliates. While
these end-of-quarter data are quite volatile and can be reversed in the
first days of a new quarter, monthly average data for July (line 1 of the
International Banking Data table) indicate that the level of net claims on
own foreign offices rose further in July.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average exchange value of the dollar, in terms of the
other G-10 currencies, has declined nearly 5 percent since the July 3 FOMC
meeting, as shown in the accompanying chart. The dollar declined 5-1/2
percent against the mark and 2-1/2 percent against the yen. Signs of
weakness in the U.S. economy, the slight easing of U.S. monetary policy, and
some tightening of conditions on foreign money markets combined to weaken
the dollar. Late in the intermeeting period, the dollar received some
temporary support from uncertainty generated by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. However, flight to the dollar as a safe haven does not seem to have
been extensive.
Three-month interest rates rose 1/4 percentage point during the
intermeeting period in both Germany and Japan, while declining by an
equivalent amount in the United States. The Bank of Japan nudged up short-
term market interest rates in response to perceived inflationary pressures
stemming from strong Japanese economic activity and a tight Japanese labor

market. In Germany, the call money rate remained near the 8 percent Lombard
rate, where it has been since German monetary union in early July, as market
participants speculated that the Bundesbank would decide to tighten at its
next meeting on August 23.
As shown in the accompanying table, stock and bond prices declined
sharply in most major countries following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and
the subsequent $5 per barrel increase in spot prices of oil (for a total
increase of $10 per barrel since early July). Japanese stock prices
declined about 4-1/2 percent before the invasion and another 6-1/2 percent,
on balance, after the invasion. The yield on the Japanese bellwether
government bond rose about 60 basis points over the period, to almost
8 percent. German stock prices declined 9 percent, all since the invasion,
while the German bond yield rose 25 basis points. The price of gold rose
nearly $40, with three-quarters of that coming after the Iraqi invasion.
The U.S. Treasury purchased over $400 million in the market
Those dollar purchases enabled the Exchange
Stabilization Fund to repurchase marks that had been warehoused with the
System, leaving $7 billion equivalent of marks outstanding.
The currency grid of the European Monetary System became fully
extended during the intermeeting period, with the Spanish peseta nearly
6 percent above its central rate, and the Italian lira 2-1/4 percent above
its central rate, against the bottom-most EMS currencies (variously the
mark, the French franc, and the Dutch guilder).

Sterling rose nearly 2 percent against the mark over the intermeeting
period, benefiting from speculation that it may join the Exchange Rate
Mechanism of the EMS in the near future and from official indications that
U.K. monetary policy will remain tight until there is evidence of declining
U.K. inflation.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Although indicators from the second quarter in Japan and Germany
suggest a continued robust underlying rate of growth, real economic activity
in the rest of the industrial countries has apparently slowed from the first
quarter, with Canada particularly weak. Domestic demand, particularly
consumer spending, has slackened somewhat with drops in retail sales in
Canada and the United Kingdom.
Sluggish growth is reflected in a smaller trade deficits in France,
Italy, and the United Kingdom. Compared with the first half of last year,
the Canadian and German external trade positions were about the same, while
the Japanese surpluses have narrowed.
Except in the United Kingdom, measures of inflation have slowed,
although pressures from tight capacity utilization in France and Japan,
relatively large wage increases in Canada and Italy, and issues related to
credit and fiscal policy and currency unification in Germany may push
inflation rates higher. Real exchange rate appreciation in Japan and France
has tempered some of the upward pressure implied by increases in costs.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, recent data suggest that the pace
of real activity remained strong. Industrial production (s.a.) in the
second quarter was 1.9 percent higher than in the first quarter, although
growth in June declined from the 2.5 percent increase recorded in May. The
capacity utilization rate (s.a.) rose 2.8 percent in May to its highest
level in 16 years. Retail sales (s.a.) posted a 12-month increase of

11.9 percent, rising 2.9 percent in June. Housing starts (s.a.) jumped 8.4
percent in May, the largest monthly increase since 1983. The unemployment
rate (s.a.) remained close to its 10-year low of 2 percent, edging up only
to 2.2 percent in June. The ratio of job offers to applicants (s.a.) rose
to a 12-year peak of 1.41 in May.
Despite the growing evidence of strains on production capacity and in
the labor market, recorded inflation rates have remained stable. Consumer
prices in Tokyo (n.s.a.) increased 0.1 percent in July, while the 12-month
change was only 2.6 percent. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) declined by 0.1
percent in July and were up only 0.8 percent on a 12-month basis.
Reflecting a stronger yen and lower oil prices, the wholesale price of
imported goods declined by 6.1 percent over the May-July period, almost
entirely reversing the 6.2 percent increase in import prices in March-April
when the yen weakened.
Both the trade and the current account surpluses (s.a.) increased in
June. Over the first half of the year, the cumulative current account
surplus was $47.4 billion (s.a.a.r.), little changed from the second half of
last year, but substantially lower than in the first half of 1989.
Economic developments in West Germany have been dominated by the
process of unification with East Germany. The Treaty implementing an
economic and monetary union between the two Germanys went into effect on
July 1 with the initial adjustment progressing relatively smoothly.
Withdrawals of DM currency by East Germans were significantly below
expectations, suggesting that the introduction of the DM in the GDR will not
generate immediate inflationary pressures because of increased spending.
However, the demand for short-term credit from state-owned enterprises in
the GDR exceeded expectations with requests in August for credit guarantees
more than double the DM 10 billion provided under the trust fund set up to

IV-19
manage state-owned property. Fiscal deficits in the GDR will also be
somewhat higher than had previously been expected, in part because the
number of East Germans that are either unemployed or working part-time has
expanded to more than 10 percent of the labor force.
Political developments generated considerable uncertainty in the first
two weeks of August. It now appears likely thatall-German elections will
be held on December 2, but the timing of formal political unification
remains under negotiation.
The growth of industrial production (s.a.) in West Germany moderated
in the second quarter, increasing 1.6 percent (adjusting for a weather-
related correction in construction) to a level 4.7 percent above where it
was one year earlier; including construction, industrial production declined
0.9 percent. The June increase was only 0.3 percent after an increase of
3.2 percent in May. The unemployment rate remained at 7.3 in July,
unchanged since February.
Inflation remains low. Consumer prices (n.s.a) were unchanged in
July, and on a 12-month basis, consumer price inflation held at 2.4 percent
in July after being 2.3 percent in April, May and June. Wholesale prices
fell in June to a level below where they were one year ago. Producer prices
fell in July and remained just 1.4 percent above year-earlier levels.
Import prices fell 0.6 percent in April after falling 0.9 percent in May.
June import prices were 5.4 percent below their year-earlier level.
M3 growth for 1990 (s.a.a.r.) was 4.3 percent through June, at the low
end of the Bundesbank's 1990 target range of 4-6 percent, although when
Euro-DM deposits are included, M3 growth has been more than 6 percent. An
announcement of how the target for M3 growth in 1990 will be adjusted in
light of monetary union is expected on August 23. Bundesbank officials have

IV-20
indicated that the level of M3 will probably play a less important role in
short-run monetary policy decisions.
West Germany's external surpluses (excluding transactions with East
Germany) fell sharply in the second quarter as exports fell by about 5
percent. However, comparing the first half of 1990 to the same period in
the previous year, West Germany's external surpluses are little changed.
Economic activity has slowed in France in comparison to the quick pace
of 1989. Industrial production (measured on a 12-month basis) was 1.5
percent higher in May, compared with a 5.1 percent increase a year earlier.
French inflation has been moderate despite tight capacity utilization
in part because the strength of the franc has intensified import
competition. Consumer prices (n.s.a.) rose 0.2 percent in June although
inflation has fallen from 3.6 percent on a twelve-month basis at the end of
last year to 3.0 percent in June. The franc measured on a weighted-average
basis appreciated 9.9 percent in the year to June. Despite the appreciation,
the merchandise trade deficit has remained relatively stable.
Real economic activity in the United Kingdom has been sluggish.
Retail sales in June fell 2.4 percent while manufacturing output declined
0.6 percent to a level 2.5 percent above its level a year ago. Although
industrial production rose 2.1 percent in June, the increase was due
entirely to deferred maintenance of North Sea oil platforms raising energy
output above its normal seasonal level. Unemployment rose for the third
month running, although the unemployment rate remained at 5.7 percent in
June.
Consumer prices continued to rise rapidly. The overall 12-month rate
of retail price inflation was 9.8 percent in June. Excluding mortgage
interest payments and the poll tax, the "underlying" rate of inflation was
6.9 percent in May. Output prices for manufactured goods (n.s.a.) rose

IV-21
0.3 percent in July to a level 6.1 percent above year-earlier levels. In
May, the underlying annual rate of increase in average earnings remained at
9-3/4 percent.
Sluggish economic activity has narrowed the cumulative trade deficit
for the first half of the year to $17.2 billion compared with a $20.8
billion deficit for the same period last year. The cumulative current
account deficit remained about the same as last year ($14.9 billion) as the
invisibles surplus continued to erode. In recent weeks, the pound has
strengthened as a result of rising oil prices and rumors that entry of
sterling into the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS is imminent.
Recent data suggest some slowing of economic activity in Italy after
somewhat stronger than expected first-quarter growth of GDP of 3.6 percent
(s.a.a.r.). Industrial production (s.a.) declined 2.5 percent in May to a
level only 0.7 percent above its level of a year earlier. For the first
five months of the year, industrial production was up only 1.9 percent from
the corresponding period of 1989.
The Italian consumer price index in July was 5.7 percent above its
level a year earlier, little changed from the increase in June. Wholesale
price and producer price increases in May of 3.9 and 3.6 percent,
respectively, from their levels a year earlier were smaller than the April
increases. However, in May the overall index of wages and salaries (n.s.a)
increased sharply to a level almost 8 percent above its level a year
earlier, reflecting the impact of recent public sector wage settlements.
These are likely to contribute to inflationary pressures in the coming
months.
Indicators from Canada for the second quarter point to a slower rate
of growth following the first quarter when domestic demand rose by 1.8
percent compared with the fourth-quarter figure of 6.3 percent. Retail

IV-22
sales (s.a.) fell 1.0 percent in May after dropping 1.4 percent in April and
wholesale trade (s.a.) was off 1.6 percent in May after falling 0.9 percent
in April. Housing remains a particularly weak sector with starts (s.a.)
falling 7.3 percent in June to stand 5.8 percent below a year earlier. The
number of consumer and corporate bankruptcies was more than 30 percent
higher in the first half of 1990 than last year, and was even higher than in
the 1982 recession year. The unemployment rate (s.a) rose in July to 7.8
percent from 7.5 percent in June.
First-quarter growth in real GDP (s.a.a.r) of 2.2 percent was
sustained by a positive contribution of real net exports. Although Canada's
current account deficit increased from $4.0 billion in the fourth quarter to
$4.3 billion in the first quarter, this increase was more than accounted for
by the forgiveness of developing country debt by the government of Canada.
Canada's merchandise trade surplus increased almost $500 million in May to
$808 million, as imports fell and exports rose modestly.
Inflation as measured by the consumer price index (n.s.a) continued to
come down, in part as the impact of last summer's increase in excise taxes
on the index wore off. In June, the year-over-year increase was 4.3
percent. More disturbing, however, was news that major wage settlements
(s.a.) contained increases of 6.2 percent in the first quarter, up from the
5.3 percent rate over 1989 as a whole. Finance Minister Wilson recent
warned that poor performance in holding unit labor costs down was harming
Canada's international competitiveness.
Developments in East European Economies
Hungary, which has never rescheduled its $21 billion of international
debt, emerged from its recent bout of illiquidity in the international
markets with substantial additional credits available -- a $280 million
bridge loan from the industrial countries arranged by the Bank for

IV-23
International Settlements and the United States, a West German government
guarantee of a DM 800 million 12-month revolving credit line from a
consortium of banks led by Deutsche Bank, and a World Bank guarantee of the
principal at maturity of a $200 million Eurobond private placement by
Hungary's State Development Institute.
Progress under the economic reform program is mixed. New cuts in
subsidies moved relative prices towards market-clearing levels and restored
the fiscal budget to its target range, but they caused inflation to surge
well beyond the objective of 20 percent for the year as a whole. Efforts to
remove enterprises from state control received a boost with the reopening of
the Bourse and the successful floating of stock in the travel agency IBUSZ.
In July, the government of Poland moved from focussing on fighting
inflation to revitalizing and restructuring the economy. Wage indexation
will be eased (although not eliminated) and an emergency welfare program
will aid the nearly one-third of Polish families worst hit by the lay-offs
and price increases associated with the shock program. Recent data indicate
that industrial sales by state firms (representing almost all of industrial
sales) continued to decline in June, although the rate of decline has
moderated. Based on 90-day notifications, unemployment is expected to rise
substantially over the coming months from the rate of 5.2 percent registered
in July. The government budget has been increasingly in surplus over the
first half of 1990, but expenditures on revitalizing the economy and
providing a social safety net are likely to take the budget into deficit for
the second half year; a zero balance for the year as a whole is the aim.
Private sector development is proceeding apace with both a "small
privatization program" -- that is sales or leasing of retail and small
commercial facilities directly to individuals (8 percent of state retail
shops have been so privatized this year) -- and a two-step privatization

IV-24
process for handling larger state-owned enterprises; the first step
transforms enterprises into joint-stock companies and the second step allows
citizens to purchase shares with "privatization vouchers".
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
At the end of July, Mexico prepaid the $674 million balance of the
bridge loan received in March from the Federal Reserve System and the U.S.
Treasury. Increased public confidence in Mexico's economic prospects has
been reflected in rising international reserve levels and in a decline in
interest rates and the short-term forward premium on the dollar. At the
same time, however, the trade balance has deteriorated. In Brazil, economic
activity and interest rates appear to have stabilized. Fiscal and monetary
policy remain relatively tight, but the prospects for the additional reforms
needed to sustain progress on the fiscal deficit remain uncertain. Argen-
tina has continued to run fiscal surpluses and has registered progress in
its privatization program. However, inflation has not declined as rapidly
as anticipated, despite weak aggregate demand. Venezuela's fiscal position
and the outlook for economic growth improved in August due to higher oil
export revenues. Alberto Fujimori, inaugurated as Peru's new president on
July 28, has announced severe economic adjustment measures in response to a
rapidly deepening economic crisis.
Individual country notes. Mexico took advantage of rising inter-
national reserves to prepay, on July 31, the $674 million balance of the
bridge loan received in late March from the Federal Reserve System and the
U.S. Treasury. The reserve gain from the end of March to the end of July is
estimated to have been roughly $3 billion. It reflects a strengthening of
public confidence brought about by the implementation of the bank financing
agreement in late March, by an announcement in May that the nationalized
commercial banks are to be privatized, by the speedy passage of a

IV-25
constitutional amendment that paves the way for bank privatization, by
favorable first-quarter fiscal results, by a decision not to increase
minimum wages when the anti-inflation pact was extended at the end of May,
and by the general improvement in prospects for private investment
associated with the structural adjustments carried out in recent years.
In addition, the assurance that the exchange rate will not undergo a sharp
depreciation for at least several more months, coupled with the high rates
of return from investment in financial instruments in Mexico, is providing a
strong incentive to move funds to Mexico.
The strengthening of public confidence is evident also in the
reduction of the forward premium on the dollar to 6.3 percent on August 8
from 10.5 percent in March for 180-day contracts and in the narrowing of the
spread between the free market and controlled exchange rates to 0.57 percent
on August 8 from 1.4 percent on April 2.
Inflows of private capital have been accompanied by a fall in interest
rates. At the August 7 Treasury auction, the rate for 28-day bills was
about 30 percent, 17 percentage points lower than at the mid-March peak.
This decline is likely to stimulate economic activity in the second half of
1990. The CPI rose by 1.8 percent in July, when it was 27 percent higher
than a year earlier. This is the highest 12-month increase since February
1989. However, price inflation this year is largely the result of attempts
to correct relative price distortions and restore price flexibility
gradually in order to facilitate the elimination of price controls at a
later date.
Mexico's trade balance deteriorated during the first half of 1990. In
January-May, total exports were only about 3 percent higher than in the same
period of 1989, but imports were nearly 16 percent higher, and in May Mexico
recorded its first monthly trade deficit since September 1988. The rate of

IV-26
growth of non-oil exports has fallen steadily for over two years, reflecting
a slowing of real GDP growth in the industrial countries since 1988 and some
deterioration in Mexico's international competitiveness. Moreover, the fall
in world oil prices during the first half of 1990 depressed oil export
earnings. Recent increases in these prices will provide some relief, but a
further slowing of economic activity in the industrial countries would hurt
the outlook for non-oil exports.
In Brazil, limited weekly employment data indicate that the economy
appears to have stabilized in June and July after industrial production
declined by about 4 percent between March and May. However, consumer prices
rose 13 percent in July, compared with 10 percent in June. The government
continues to run budget surpluses, and monetary policy has been relatively
tight since June. In late July, President Collor vetoed a congressional
proposal to index wages monthly and issued a provisional measure, which is
subject to congressional approval, calling for wage adjustments to be made
every six months. Brazil's trade surplus was $1.17 billion in June. The
accumulated surplus for the first half of 1990 was $6.3 billion, compared
with $9.2 billion over the same period in 1989.
Financial markets have been relatively calm in recent weeks. Domestic
short-term interest rates have remained stable at about 11 percent per
month. The spread between the dollar exchange rate in the parallel and
official markets has narrowed to about 16 percent, as the government has
reportedly sold reserves to support the cruzeiro in the parallel market.
Consultations are underway to prepare a possible IMF stand-by arrangement,
and the Brazilian government is arranging to meet individually with its
commercial bank creditors in late August and early September.
Argentina is continuing to run budget surpluses on a cash basis, but
the inflation rate has not declined as rapidly as anticipated when its

IV-27
stabilization program was launched five months ago. After rising from 13.6
percent in May to 13.9 percent in June, consumer price inflation registered
10.8 percent in July. These price increases in part reflect continued
adjustments in public sector prices and "catch-up" increases in wage rates;
they have occurred in spite of continued weakness in aggregate demand.
Industrial production in June is estimated to have been roughly 12 percent
below average monthly production in 1989 and 20 percent below the average in
1988. This weakness is attributable not only to reduced domestic demand,
but also to depressed industrial exports stemming from the overvaluation of
the free-floating Austral since March, a result of strong agricultural
export revenues and short-term capital inflows.
Argentina has made progress in its privatization program in recent
months. In late June, 60 percent of the shares in ENTEL, the state
telephone company, were awarded to two foreign consortia for a total of
$5 billion in debt paper (at face value) and $214 million in cash; Bell
Atlantic, in association with Manufacturers Hanover, will operate ENTEL's
northern operations, while Telefonica de Espana, with Citibank, will run
operations in the southern part of the country. In mid-July, an 85-percent
share in Aerolineas Argentinas, the state airline, was awarded to an
investment group led by Spain's Iberia Airlines in exchange for $2 billion
(at face value) in debt paper, $130 million in cash, and $130 million
financed over the next five years. It is expected that both companies will
be handed over to their new owners within the next few months.
On August 9, the World Bank's Executive Board approved the release of
the second $150 million tranche of the Bank's $300 million Second Trade
Policy Loan to Argentina. This loan was approved initially in October 1988,
but following disbursement of the first tranche, it was suspended in March
1989 due to Argentina's failure to implement macroeconomic reforms.

IV-28
Venezuela's fiscal position improved this month. Until the recent oil
crisis, Venezuela appeared unlikely to achieve its original goal of a zero
fiscal deficit for 1990. Weak economic activity and lower oil export prices
had depressed revenues, while outlays were boosted by a delayed realization
of losses due to foreign exchange guarantees provided for private sector
debts by the previous government. With the 1990 fiscal deficit threatening
to reach 4 percent of GDP, the government has prepared (but has not yet
implemented) measures to trim the deficit to about 2-1/2 percent of GDP.
The recent rise in oil export prices, coupled with an expected temporary
increase of crude oil production and exports of up to 500,000 barrels per
day, could boost 1990 revenues by up to 3 percent of GDP, potentially
restoring budget balance.
The Venezuelan authorities implemented long-delayed increases in the
domestic prices of petroleum products in July. However, prices remain well
below world market levels. The government's program to reform public
enterprises has been moving forward very slowly. Last month, a bank
controlling one percent of banking system assets became the second public
enterprise to be put up for sale to private investors. A July shake-up of
the Venezuelan cabinet reinforced the position of the members of the
government who have argued for accelerated privatization.
Alberto Fujimori, Peru's new president, was inaugurated on July 28 in
the midst of a rapidly deepening economic crisis. Fujimori inherited a
record level of hyperinflation (running at a daily rate of 6 percent when he
assumed office), a shortage of food (following a sharp dropoff in imports
and the continuing impact of a severe drought), and declining international
reserves. The new government has announced several elements of a
stabilization program, including a 3,000 percent increase in domestic
gasoline prices, and has asked foreign donors to support a "social emergency

IV-29
program" designed to buffer the most exposed strata of society from the
shock of long overdue macroeconomic adjustment.
