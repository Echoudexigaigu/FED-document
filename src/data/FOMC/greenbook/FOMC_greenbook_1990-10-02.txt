DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Incoming data on spending and labor demand have had a predominantly
negative cast in recent weeks, but they have yet to show the degree of
weakness suggested by survey results and much of the anecdotal information
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. On the inflation front, the August
price reports were dominated, as expected, by the surge in prices of
petroleum products, but the upward trend in prices of items other than food
and energy also appears to have steepened somewhat in recent months.
Energy Prices
After easing a bit in the second half of August, the spot prices of
crude oil surged higher again in September, moving above the peaks reached
shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The spot price of West Texas
Intermediate, as of September 25, was about $37.50 per barrel; this price is
more than $10 per barrel above the average for August and is more than
double the level of June, when spot prices were at their most recent low.
With only short lags, other oil prices (such as refiners' posted prices)
have followed spot prices upward.
The passthrough of rising oil costs was quickly reflected in the prices
of petroleum products in August, at all stages of processing. The PPI index
for finished energy was up 9-1/2 percent in that month, while the CPI for
energy rose 4-1/4 percent. Increases in gasoline and fuel oil prices were
huge in both measures; spillover to the service fuels (natural gas and
electricity) was not apparent, however.
1. In the PPI, natural gas prices are lagged one month; thus, the
9 percent drop reported for August reflects the prices of July. In the CPI,
the prices for natural gas and electricity were unchanged in August.

With the additional rise in oil prices in recent weeks, further large
advances at retail are virtually certain, probably stretching at least into
October. The surge in spot prices for oil since June translates into a rise
of more than 50 cents per gallon, less than one-fourth of which was
reflected in the August CPI. It is not clear at this point, however, that
all of the rise in crude oil prices will actually be passed on. The stocks
of gasoline, which had been relatively low over the summer, have risen in
the last three weeks into a range fairly typical for this time of year. If
stocks are maintained, or boosted further, there might well be some downward
pressures on margins, which have been very large since late spring when the
tightness of gasoline stocks was first emerging. Even with relatively
optimistic assumptions about margins, however, some further big price
increases for refined products seem likely at retail in the next month or
so.
Prices Excluding Energy
Even apart from energy, the recent price reports depict a worsening
inflation trend. The CPI excluding food and energy was up an additional
0.5 percent in August to a level about 5-1/2 percent above a year earlier.
Prices of nonenergy services rose sharply in both July and August, boosted
by hikes for lodging out of town and further large increases for owners'
equivalent rent and medical care. By contrast, the prices of commodities
less food and energy flattened out in August, after a moderate increase in
July. Prices of most key items within this category, notably apparel and
motor vehicles, were little changed in August. On a year-to-year basis, the
CPI for nonenergy services moved up to 6-1/2 percent in August, while the

In August, there was only a small spillover of higher crude oil costs
into the prices of a broader range of goods and services. However, a more
substantial spillover may start to show up in September. Airfares, for
example, were raised at the end of August, and further increases have been
announced to take effect at the beginning of October. The two rounds likely
will boost airfares more than 10 percent, although slack demand may dictate
various forms of discounting from these fares. For commodities, the
spillover of higher oil prices was not yet visible at either the consumer or
producer levels in August, the latter of which reflects only mid-month
prices. However, announcements of price increases have been showing up in
recent weeks for petroleum-based materials such as petrochemicals. Previous

II-7
oil-price shocks triggered widespread increases in prices of goods and
services at all levels, typically led in timing and magnitude by the
petroleum derivatives.
With such spillover effects still largely absent in August, the
increase in producer prices of finished goods excluding food and energy was
0.3 percent, similar to the average monthly pace earlier this year; year-
over-year increases in this measure have been somewhat below those in 1989.
The PPI for intermediate materials (less food and energy) also was up
0.3 percent in August--more than in recent months--owing mainly to a marked
firming in prices of nonferrous metals. Prices of crude nonfood materials
less food and energy were up 1.8 percent, boosted by large increases for
metal scrap and ore, and were about 2-1/2 percent above their level of a
year earlier.
After surging 0.8 percent in June, consumer food prices rose
0.4 percent in July and 0.3 percent in August. Despite the slowing in these
months, the year-to-year trend in food prices remained above the 5 percent
mark, where it has been lodged ever since the 1988 drought. During this
two-year period, inflation pressures have been the most persistent for
cereals, meats, and dairy products. With grain prices down sharply in
recent months, one source of pressure on the prices of these foods has
eased. Nevertheless, the anticipated slowing of prices at retail could be
delayed if rising energy costs are passed on readily to consumers or if,
facing a potentially soft economy, livestock producers were to be more
cautious in expanding supplies than would seem to be warranted by the drop
in feed costs.

Since mid-August, the Journal of Commerce index of industrial prices
has moved up about 3 percent, largely reflecting the "miscellaneous"
component, which includes crude oil (with a weight of about 7 percent in the
index total). The commodity price indexes produced by the Commodity
Research Bureau have exhibited a generally sideways trend since the last
Greenbook.
Employment and Unemployment
Data for August and early September indicated a further weakening in
the labor market. The unemployment rate rose an additional 0.1 percentage
point to 5.6 percent, and private payroll employment declined 12,000,
offsetting July's meager advance. Labor input, as measured by aggregate
hours of production or nonsupervisory workers, now is reported to have
declined in both July and August, and for the two months together, average
hours were unchanged from the second-quarter level. In the weeks since the
August surveys, initial claims for unemployment insurance have increased
further, moving into a range a little higher than was seen over the
preceding few months.
In the goods-producing sector, declines in payroll employment were
widespread in August. Construction lost about 40,000 jobs for a second
month. Manufacturing employment also fell further as producers of durable
goods shed nearly 50,000 workers; about half of those losses came in
electrical equipment and motor vehicles. In contrast, producers of
nondurable goods posted a small increase, owing in part to gains in food ana
petroleum processing. The manufacturing workforce has shrunk by more than
450,000 jobs since employment cutbacks began early last year.

Employment gains in the service industry were relatively small in July
and August--about 65,000 per month, on average. Much of the recent slowing
has been in business services, which had been a strong performer early in
the year but was flat in July and August. In contrast, health services
continued to expand almost as rapidly as earlier this year. Over the past
twelve months, health services have accounted for nearly 40 percent of the
total gain in private payrolls.
Details of the August household survey also gave fairly widespread
indications of a weakening labor market. Total employment continued to
contract, and the number of unemployed persons rose 189,000 in August. The
labor force participation rate fell further to its lowest level since late
1988, owing in part to a sharp decline in the participation of teenagers.
In the past year, participation rates for teens have dropped off more than
5 percentage points, possibly reflecting a growing perception that jobs are
difficult to find. The participation rate of women aged 20 to 24 climbed
higher in August, but still remained below its average level in 1989. 2
For adult men and women (aged 25 and older), participation rates held steady
or edged higher.
The August report on payroll employment incorporated annual benchmark
revisions derived from March 1989 unemployment insurance tax records and
updated seasonal adjustment factors; these revisions affected data going
back to 1985. As shown in the table, the effects of the benchmark were
relatively small in the aggregate, as downward adjustments in construction,
2. The participation rate of women aged 20 to 24 dipped sharply in
December of 1989 to 70.3 percent from 72.0 percent in November. It averaged
72.4 percent in 1989. Since that time, their participation rate has
gradually returned to 72 percent, while the participation rate of men in the
same age group has generally moved lower.

manufacturing, and finance, insurance, and real estate were partially offset
by an upward revision in services. Overall, these revisions, which were
based on unemployment insurance tax records for the first quarter of 1989,
were substantially smaller than would have been expected based on more
recent unemployment insurance tax data.
The employment surveys in coming months will be affected to some degree
by the call-up of the military reserves.3 Essentially no reservists had
been activated at the time of the August survey, but by September 25, about
25,000 had been called for active duty, and an additional 15,000 are
expected to be called up in the next several weeks. For the most part,
reservists will serve 90-day tours of duty, which could be extended another
90 days. Employers are required by law to hold open a reservist's job until
he or she returns from active duty. Although many employers will hire
temporary workers to fill the gap, some temporary declines in payrolls may
be evident. Industries expected to be hardest hit are airlines, protective
services (including police, prison guards, and private security guards), and
health care, where the nursing shortage already is a significant problem.
Issues Related to the Growth of Potential GNP
Over the past year, several developments have emerged that, taken
together, suggest that the growth of potential GNP may not be as high as the
staff--and others--had previously estimated. This issue is of central
concern because the estimate of potential GNP growth--the rate at which the
3. Reservists are excluded from the payroll survey of employment. The
household survey of the civilian noninstitutional population also excludes
reservists, although the "total labor force" and "total noninstitutional
population" include figures obtained from the Department of Defense on
members of the Armed Forces stationed in the United States.

II-15
economy can expand without generating systematic pressure on inflation--is a
key element in tying down the staff's price and output projections.
The developments that have called the earlier estimates of potential
GNP into question are the following: (1) the persistence of the
unemployment rate at a level of around 5-1/4 percent throughout 1989 and the
early part of 1990, a period in which the actual growth of real GNP was, on
average, well below the staff's estimate of potential GNP growth; (2) a
flattening out of the labor force participation rate, which has held the
growth of actual labor input below its estimated potential pace; and
(3) disappointing productivity growth over the period, seemingly a departure
from the gradually improving trend that had become evident earlier in the
expansion.
At mid-year, it still appeared possible that upcoming revisions in the
data might allay these concerns, as had happened in similar circumstances in
some previous years. However, the July revisions to real GNP were downward
rather than upward and led the staff, in the August Greenbook, to
tentatively lower its point estimate of potential GNP growth from
2.7 percent to 2.5 percent. In terms of a "growth accounting" decomposition
of potential GNP, we currently see the pieces adding up in the following
way:
Contribution to the growth
of potential GNP
(percentage points)
Growth of the working-age population .8
Trend growth in labor force participation .4
Trend growth in the average workweek 0
Trend growth of labor productivity 1.3
Total 2.5

II-16
We still regard these estimates as being tentative. Although the
August benchmark revisions to the payroll employment data did not lead to
further adjustment of our numbers, some additional refinement is possible
when the BLS's upcoming reestimates of total hours worked and labor
productivity become available in early November. More fundamentally, our
current models suggest that, with regard to labor productivity and the
participation rate, temporary cyclical influences can account for much, but
not all, of the differences between the trend estimates and the actual
figures we have seen in recent quarters. If incoming data over the next few
months continue to show unexpected shortfalls in labor force growth or
productivity, then our current estimates of potential GNP growth may need to
be revised still further. In view of the difficult conceptual and empirical
issues that are involved, a range of uncertainty will continue to surround
any particular point estimate, even in the best of circumstances.
Wages and Collective Bargaining
Little statistical information on labor costs has become available
since the last Greenbook. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in
August after a downward-revised increase of 0.4 percent in July. Over the
twelve months ended in August, average hourly earnings rose 4.0 percent--
about the same pace as recorded during the previous twelve months.
On the collective bargaining front, the United Auto Workers (UAW) and
General Motors announced a tentative agreement on September 17. The
proposed three-year contract covers about 300,000 workers and calls for wage
increases of 3 percent in the first year and lump sums of 3 percent in the
second and third years--the same package as in the 1987 agreement. This

pay package is a bit smaller than those in other major collective bargaining
agreements reached so far this year, but the benefits package is
substantially more generous than that seen in other contracts.
Job security was the focus of the negotiations this year. The new
agreement permits GM to shut more plants and does not require it to reemploy
the 30,000 workers already on layoff. In return, the proposed contract
guarantees the income of workers for a period of one to three years,
depending upon seniority. As with the 1987 contract, this tentative
agreement requires GM to hire one worker for every two who quit, retire, or
die. But, to induce more workers to leave the company, monthly pensions
were raised for those selecting early retirement, and restrictions on non-
pension income were relaxed. Workers who leave under this early retirement
program do not have to be replaced by GM under the one-for-two rule. For
GM, where the average worker is 44 years old and only six years away from

early retirement, this exemption is significant; according to GM, quits and
early retirements could cut the workforce by 80,000 by 1995. Little change
was made in the health care package, which is among the most comprehensive
in the country. Other details of the proposed pact include an enhanced
profit sharing program, higher penalties paid into the company training fund
for use of "excessive" overtime, and the same COLA protection as under the
1987 agreement (the effective passthrough of prices into wages amounts
to about 95 percent).
Industrial Production
Industrial production was flat in July and declined 0.2 percent in
August. Nevertheless, because of strong gains in May and June, the average
level of production in July and August was nearly 2 percent at an annual
rate above the second-quarter average.
Assemblies of autos and light trucks, which had risen sharply in the
spring, turned down in July and were little changed in August. In both
months, assemblies came in considerably below the schedules that automakers
had announced at the beginning of the month. This shortfall resulted in
part from a number of temporary plant closings to control inventories. In
addition, a strike at a GM parts supplier cut into the output of trucks.
Outside of the motor vehicles sector, the recent trends have been mixed.
Production of consumer goods excluding motor vehicles has firmed a bit in
recent months after falling earlier this year. However, output of capital
goods excluding motor vehicles has softened in recent months after a strong
first-half gain of 8 percent at an annual rate, which was boosted, in part,
by a rebound from the strike at Boeing. Production of construction supplies

declined further in July and August, reflecting weakness in building
activity.
The September index levels will be pushed up by a rebound in auto
production. Automakers' current plans for September call for a
1-1/4 million unit increase in auto assemblies to a 7-3/4 million unit
annual rate and a 300,000 unit rise in truck assemblies to a 4-1/4 million
unit rate (based on FRB seasonal factors); physical product data for the
first three weeks of September indicate that actual assemblies are about on
schedule. At this pace, these increases would boost the total industrial
production index a bit less than 1/2 percentage point in September. In
addition, data on electricity generation showed a substantial increase
through mid-month, and unless generation plunges in the second half of the
month, this will provide a further lift to September IP. Even allowing for
possible weakness in other components, total IP seems likely to register a
noticeable increase for the month.
Capacity utilization in total industry has edged down in recent months,
and the August operating rate of 83.1 percent, while still 1 percentage
point above its longer-run average, was nearly a point below the level of a
year earlier. A notable exception to the general pattern is petroleum
refining, where the August operating rate was up a little from a year
earlier and about 4-1/2 percentage points above its historical average.
Utilization also has held up in primary metals, where production has been
maintained this year, in part, by increased demand from the motor vehicle
industry; U.S. producers have benefited, too, from a recent strike that has
idled two major Canadian steelmakers.

Personal Consumption Expenditures
Since the runup in energy prices, households perceive the state of the
economy to have deteriorated. The Michigan and Conference Board measures of
consumer sentiment dropped sharply in August, with both indexes reaching
their lowest readings since 1983. More negative responses were registered
to all of the major questions in the indexes, as consumers apparently.
associated the events in the Middle East with a less robust view of current
and expected conditions for both their personal financial situations and
aggregate economic activity. In a preliminary, confidential reading based
on an incomplete sample, the Michigan sentiment index edged off 2 more index
points in September.
This deterioration in surveyed consumer sentiment apparently has not
translated into a marked retrenchment in spending. In constant-dollar
terms, real PCE edged down 0.1 percent in August. Averaging spending in
July and August, the level of total real PCE was more than 3 percent at an
annual rate above its second-quarter level. Spending on motor vehicles and
parts fell 3-1/2 percent last month, roughly in line with unit sales
figures. However, real gasoline purchases rose moderately, and outlays for
other consumer goods also posted moderate increases, on balance. Spending
on services rose 0.1 percent in August, a pace well below the average
increases registered over the past several months.
Real disposable income fell 0.3 percent last month, leaving the July-
August average fractionally above the second-quarter level. The weakness in
real personal income in August reflected a flattening of wage and salary
income and a deterioration in purchasing power associated with the increases
in consumer prices. Pressure on the real incomes of households is, of

course, a primary channel through which the effects of rising oil prices are
expected to exert their adverse influence on real activity. In this regard,
given that direct energy outlays currently account for about 5-1/2 percent
of total nominal consumption expenditures (down from 9-1/4 percent in 1980),
each 10 percent increase in consumer energy prices cuts about 1/2 percent
out of household purchasing power; the loss is greater still when account is
taken of potential indirect price and output effects.
Autos and Light Trucks
The demand for motor vehicles appears to have held up quite well on
balance since the jump in oil prices. Total sales of autos and light
trucks (both domestic and imported), at an annual rate of 13.8 million units
in August, were down only moderately from the pace of 14.4 million units in

July and the second-quarter rate of 14 million units. In the first twenty
days of September, sales of domestically produced units picked up from the
August pace, to a higher rate than in any of the previous few months; the
September numbers should be viewed with extra caution, however, in view of
the problems of seasonal adjustment around the end of the model year. The
inventories of cars at the end of August were near the normally desired
level of 60 days' supply, but stocks of light trucks seemed to be on the
high side of desired levels.
Price increases announced by automakers on 1991 models have been
relatively moderate. 4 However, these announced price increases come on
the heels of price hikes that were implemented earlier in the summer by some
car makers. Furthermore, because car inventories have been leaner than in
many recent autumns, car manufacturers have not turned to the "fire sale"
pricing strategies that were used in those years. The companies' strategies
still are in flux, though. All automakers have announced incentives on some
1991 model-year cars. Ford has scaled back its earlier price increases,
while, in a change of marketing strategy, it trimmed some rebates that it
announced earlier and simultaneously enhanced dealer incentives.

investment picture since the oil shock is clearly one of increased
uncertainty and heightened caution. As yet, however, reports of marked
cutbacks in spending plans are not widespread.
The recent indicators of equipment spending still seem to show a
relatively flat trend overall, with a wide range of positives and negatives
across sectors. In August, shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding
aircraft rose 3-1/4 percent, but this gain reversed only part of a large
July decline; for the two months together, average shipments were
1-3/4 percent below the second-quarter level. Within this category, nominal
shipments of office and computing equipment in July and August were
4 percent below the second-quarter average; thus, even with prices
continuing on their downward trend this quarter, an increase in real
computer outlays seems unlikely. By contrast, some strength has been
evident in the spending indicators for aircraft and motor vehicles.
Shipments of complete aircraft in July were 5 percent above the second-
quarter average; moreover, because exports were down, a larger than usual
fraction of these aircraft likely were shipped to domestic airlines.
Average sales of heavy trucks in July and August were 9 percent above the
second-quarter level.
Looking ahead, new orders for nondefense capital goods other than

July and August was little changed from that of the second quarter and
suggests continued sluggishness in spending for these categories in coming
months. Similarly, the recent run-up in gasoline and diesel prices, and the

part by buyers delaying orders in anticipation of new IBM mainframe
products.

heightened uncertainty about their future course, augurs poorly for
increased investment in motor vehicles. In contrast, the persistence of a
large backlog of unfilled orders for aircraft should ensure increases in
future production of planes, although these gains are likely to be limited
by capacity constraints.
Construction put in place increased in both June and July, if one
takes the preliminary data for those months at face value. Virtually
all other indicators--as well as the anecdotal evidence--suggest that the
trend in nonresidential building is downward. The advance indicators of
office and other commercial construction continue to look generally weak,
reflecting both the persistence of high vacancy rates for commercial
properties and the financial pressures that the slump in real estate has put
on builders and lenders. In addition, the reduced pressures on industrial
capacity since late 1988 have been accompanied by a downturn in the
commitments for new factory construction. On a brighter note, the outlook
for increases in drilling activity would seem to have improved of late,
given the recent oil price developments; footage drilled in July, before the
price surge, was about 4 percent above the second-quarter average.
The latest Commerce Department survey of business plans for spending on
plant and equipment indicates a 5.4 percent rise in nominal outlays this
year. These plans, which were tallied in July and August, are nearly
1-1/2 percentage points lower than those reported in the spring, with the
6. The BEA calculates the advance estimate of the growth in drilling and
mining from a weighted average of the change in total footage drilled and of
the Baker-Hughes count of drilling rigs in use. For later estimates, the
BEA couples the footage-drilled series with information on regional drilling
activity. Regional differences can be important because the cost of
drilling varies so widely; indeed, a foot drilled in, say, Alaska costs
about 10 times as much as one drilled in Texas.

downward revision concentrated in the nonmanufacturing sector. By this time
of year, of course, the annual figures for 1990 are being heavily influenced
by developments in past quarters; small changes in the annual averages thus
are consistent with a wide range of second-half growth rates.

Business Inventories
Data on business inventories currently are available only through the
end of July. At that point, there was little evidence of any serious
inventory imbalances, as inventory-sales ratios for major sectors were all
within the ranges observed over the past year. Given the cautious inventory
practices that have been apparent throughout the expansion, it would seem
likely that businesses were poised to respond quickly to any sign of
emerging softness in sales in the period since July. Indeed, anecdotal
evidence suggests that retailers have been ordering conservatively for the
coming months.
Manufacturing inventories expanded at a $29 billion annual rate
(current cost) in July, after falling $20 billion in June--a modest net

accumulation that kept the stock-shipments ratio near the lows of the
current expansion. Much of the fluctuation in these two months is explained
by sharp inventory swings in a few industries--aircraft, motor vehicles, and
office and computing machinery--apparently the result of unusually large
month-to-month fluctuations in shipments from these industries.
After widespread reductions in June, wholesale and non-auto retail
trade inventories expanded again in July, at a pace similar to the average
rate of accumulation over the second quarter. For most types of trade
establishments, especially those carrying consumer goods, inventory-sales
ratios in July were either little changed or down somewhat from their spring
levels. In particular, the inventory position of the broad range of retail
stores in the "GAF" grouping (general merchandise, apparel, and furniture
and appliances) improved despite slow sales; their overall inventory-sales
ratio, at 2.38 in July, was near the low end of the range posted over the
past year.
Housing Markets
The slide in residential construction activity continued in August.
Total private housing starts fell 2 percent to a 1.13 million units annual
pace, the seventh consecutive monthly decline.
In the single-family sector, starts dropped back 3 percent to
840,000 units in August, and permit issuance also slowed 3 percent. The
pace of single-family starts has remained in close alignment with permits in
recent months, so the two series give a consistent indication of a gradual
contraction in home building. For the most part, the slowing can be traced
to weak demand for new single-family homes. New home sales in July were
estimated at 548,000 units at an annual rate; sales now have been below

600,000 units for five successive months, the weakest performance since late
1982 and early 1983. Consumer attitudes toward homebuying fell sharply in
August, according to the Michigan Survey Research Center; preliminary
results for September show little change in attitudes from those expressed
in August. The one slightly encouraging development in the market for new
homes is that inventories continued to inch down in July. Meanwhile, sales
of existing homes edged up 2 percent in August to 3.4 million units at an
annual rate from a downward-revised July level; this figure is about the
same as the 1989 pace.
Home price increases have continued to diminish in recent months. The
median price of new homes in July was up 4 percent from a year earlier, well
below the average year-to-year increases seen in the first half of 1990.
The year-to-year rise in the median price of existing homes was 1.3 percent
in August, somewhat less than in the first half. The year-to-year rise in
the price series that controls for shifts in the quality and geographic
distribution of homes sold was up only 0.5 percent in the second quarter of
1990, the last available reading.
In the multifamily sector, starts averaged 283,000 units at an annual
rate in July and August. This level of starts is down two-thirds from the
peak of the current housing cycle and about equals the cyclical lows reached
in the 1981-82 recession. Issuance of multifamily permits in July and
August remained at the very low second-quarter pace, suggesting no real
upturn is in train. As in the single-family sector, however, the persistent
overstock of rental units has lessened somewhat; the multifamily rental
vacancy rate declined nearly one percentage point to 8.5 percent in the

second quarter, but still stands near the high end of the range of vacancy
rates seen over this housing cycle.
Federal Government Sector
In August, the federal government recorded a $53 billion budget
deficit, as more than $25 billion of outlays were shifted from September
into August because the first three days of September fell on non-business
days. Excluding this payments shift, the deficit for the October-August
period stood at $215 billion, compared with a $146 billion deficit for the
year-earlier period. Rising payments by the Resolution Trust Corporation
for the thrift bailout have accounted for more than half of this year's
increase.
Abstracting from the payments shift, outlays for the first eleven
months of the fiscal year were 10 percent above a year earlier, and outlays
excluding deposit insurance were up 7 percent, mainly reflecting increases
for net interest, Medicare and health, and social security and income
security. National defense spending for the same period was about the
same as a year earlier.
Year-to-year growth of federal receipts appears to have picked up in
the final quarter of the 1990 fiscal year. The July and August monthly
Treasury statements, together with daily data for September, indicate that
7. Payments were made on August 31 for social security ($21 billion), some
military pay ($3 billion), supplemental security income ($1 billion), and
veterans' benefits ($1 billion). The social security payments normally are
made on the third day of the month, and the others go out on the first day
of the month.
8. Deposit insurance outlays totaled $48 billion for the October-August
period compared to $13 billion a year earlier. As of September 18, the RTC
had spent $17 billion of the $41 billion approved by the Oversight Board for
resolutions and advances in the July-September period. Net spending was
only $12 billion, as the RTC received $5 billion from REFCORP in July.

II-40
tax receipts for the quarter may be 6 or 7 percent above a year earlier.
Over the three previous quarters, the year-to-year rate of growth had been
held to 4 percent, on average, because of declines in collections of
corporate profits taxes and weak final payments on 1989 personal income tax
liability in the second quarter of 1990.
The Department of Defense has released preliminary estimates of the
incremental cost of Operation Desert Shield: $1.9 billion for August and
September and $11.3 billion for FY1991, assuming currently projected force
9levels throughout the year. This estimate includes the effects of a
$10 per barrel increase on the Department's normal fuel bill; subtracting
this amount yields a net cost for Desert Shield of $1.6 billion for the
third quarter and $9.6 billion for FY1991. However, not all of this expense
is expected to be borne by the U.S. Treasury, and some of the costs will not
even be recorded in government accounts. For instance, some of the
"in-country" support costs, such as fuel and food, are being absorbed by the
host countries, and financial contributions from allies seem likely.
In-kind contributions are not expected to enter into either the unified
budget or the NIPA accounts. In addition, sale of about $2.5 billion to
Saudi Arabia of F-15 aircraft, tanks, and munitions are scheduled to take
place between September and December. Because this equipment will come out
of existing Department of Defense inventories, reducing defense purchases
and increasing exports by equal amounts, the sale will have no net effect on
GNP.
9. Neither official nor unofficial estimates of current or projected force
levels are being released by the Department of Defense.

II-41
As of September 26, budget negotiators had not yet resolved several of
the major issues that have held a bipartisan agreement in abeyance since
talks resumed earlier in September. The House Appropriations Committee has
begun to consider a continuing resolution that is required to fund the
government beginning October 1. The measure includes a provision that would
delay implementation of the sequester until October 20. However, it is
likely that the temporary suspension of the sequester will occur only if the
major budget issues are resolved. If the sequester is not suspended or
repealed, then furloughs and cutbacks in government services will begin the
first week of October.
State and Local Government Sector
Indicators of activity in the state and local sectors have shown a bit
of an up-and-down pattern this year, but the underlying trend seems one of
sluggishness, with spending constrained by widespread fiscal difficulties.
Construction spending by state and local governments appears to have
stabilized around mid-year, at least for a time, as construction put in
place in July, in real terms, was 1/2 percent above the second-quarter
average; construction had surged in the first quarter of this year, when
damage from Hurricane Hugo and the earthquake was being repaired, but it
fell in the second quarter. Employment growth in the state and local
sector picked up in July and August, but the pace seems unsustainable given
the apparent financial pressures on these governmental units.
The combined state and local deficit in the operating and capital
accounts, excluding social insurance funds, edged up to $30.4 billion in the
second quarter. As a result of growing budgetary shortfalls over the year,
24 states enacted tax hikes in fiscal 1990; the National Conference of State

Legislatures estimates that these increases will pull in $8.6 billion in
additional receipts, the largest increase in percentage terms since 1983.
Many states also have cut expenditures from the levels previously planned.
Indicators of the Probability of Recession
The staff's recession-probability measure that is based on the Commerce
Department's index of leading economic indicators covers only the data
through July, and puts the probability of a recession starting in the next
six months at 8 percent. An update will be included in the Greenbook
Supplement on Friday, after the release of the leading indicators for
August. The most recent reading of the NBER recession-probability measure
showed a 3 percent probability of recession; this figure was based on
exchange rates and interest rates through August 24, as well as the
nonfinancial data through July.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Developments in financial markets since the August FOMC meeting have
continued to reflect a high degree of uncertainty and growing stress.
Participants have been focusing on developments in the oil market, signs of
both rising domestic inflation and weakening economic activity, and
deliberations on the federal budget. Federal funds generally have traded
near 8 percent; nevertheless, Treasury bill rates have declined, reflecting
heightened investor preference for liquidity and safety, while rates on
commercial paper and bank CDs of similar maturities have risen. The net
effect of market responses has been a further steepening of the Treasury
yield curve; the yield spread between thirty-year Treasury bonds and three-
month Treasury bills is more than 40 basis points greater than at the time
of the last meeting. Lately, subordinated debt obligations of some major
banking institutions have moved effectively into the junk price class, as
the health of these organizations has become an increasing concern of
investors and recently released government reports have highlighted problems
of large banks and the deposit insurance fund.
Monetary expansion has been more rapid in the past two months, but
evidently in large part because of increased liquidity preference and
special factors. A considerable part of M2 growth has been in MMMFs and
might only be reflecting some parking of funds awaiting calmer capital
markets. Similarly, the spurt in bank credit in August appears to have been
largely ephemeral; increases in basic business, real estate, and consumer
loan categories remained sluggish.

Overall borrowing by nonfinancial businesses in recent months has been
weak. Investment-grade firms as a group have issued a moderate volume of
commercial paper in recent weeks, while delaying bond offerings in the hope
that rates will decline in the months ahead; the market has remained
essentially closed to below-investment-grade offerings. Elsewhere,
increasing budget difficulties experienced by states and localities are
showing up in a widening of quality spreads among issuers. Only a few
downgradings have occurred thus far, however, and overall issuance of tax-
exempt debt has continued at a pace near that of the first half. In the
household sector, the demand for mortgage and consumer credit probably has
remained relatively subdued.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The monetary aggregates posted relatively large advances in August, and
preliminary indications are that the growth spurt continued in September.
However, the pickup seems to be largely attributable to several special
factors, including a heightened demand for both liquidity at home and
currency overseas following the Iraqi invasion.
M1 growth jumped to a 10-3/4 percent annual rate in August, after
little change in July. Currency growth surged to a 15 percent pace,
apparently bolstered by shipments to the Middle East. Demand deposit growth
also rose at a double-digit average rate in August, owing in part to the
multi-day power outage that delayed completion of funds-transfer operations
at some large banks in New York City. In addition, OCDs resumed expanding
in August, after a decline arising from the introduction of a NOW account
sweeping service at a major regional bank in July. Evidence for September
suggests some slowing, but still rapid growth in Ml; currency growth remains

brisk, and faster growth in OCDs is partially offsetting a slowing in demand
deposits.
Growth of M2 picked up to a 6-3/4 percent annual rate last month, and
appears to have remained near that rate in September, reflecting both the
strength in M1 and a sharp rise in inflows to money market mutual funds, as
investors continue seeking a refuge from the uncertainties of the stock and
bond markets. Yet, despite the boost to growth provided by these factors in
the third quarter, M2 is estimated to have expanded at only a 3 percent
annual rate on a quarterly average basis, a rate that is about 2-1/2
percentage points below the pace implied by the staff's model of money
demand, and would suggest a further increase in velocity.
M3 accelerated to a 4-3/4 percent rate of increase in August. The
relative inactivity of the RTC in August served to slow both the growth of
retail deposits at commercial banks and to stanch the runoff of such
deposits at thrifts. Nonetheless, because the Treasury continued to borrow
heavily to finance expected thrift resolutions, Treasury balances at
commercial banks ballooned. This allowed banks to cut back on their managed
liabilities--including large time deposits, which posted a considerable
monthly decline. Still, the pickup in M2 largely showed through to M3, as
the runoff of large time deposits at both thrifts and banks was mostly
offset by a firming in the other non-M2 components of M3. Growth of M3 in
September is expected to slow somewhat from that experienced in August, but
the broad aggregate will still be well above the lower limit of its current
annual target range.

III-6
Paced by a surge in security loans, bank credit strengthened to a
10-1/4 percent annual rate of expansion in August. Banks may have chosen to
deploy a portion of the bulge in government deposits in reverse repurchase
agreements--a form of a security loan that has short duration and
flexibility. Security loans constitute only a small portion of total bank
lending, but accounted for about one-third of the total increase in bank
credit during August. Neither lending to nonfinancial businesses nor to
households showed much spark. The 3-3/4 percent annualized increase in
business loans for August reflects a spurt in merger-related lending at
large and foreign-related banks, so that abstracting from identifiable
merger-related financing, business loans declined at a 4-1/2 percent pace.
At small banks, business loans continued to decline last month, as they have
since early spring. Sorting out the demand from the supply factors holding
down business loan growth is especially difficult. Given that a substantial
amount of lending is done under prior commitments, the effects of some
supply responses on loans made may be delayed.
Real estate loans at banks grew at about a 5 percent annual rate in
August--only 4 percent, after subtracting home equity loans--and were off
sharply from the average growth for the first half of the year. Although
consumer loan growth picked up from July, much of the gain is attributable
to reduced securitization activities during August. When adjusted for
securitizations, consumer loans grew 7 percent in August, down from the
9 percent pace in July. The preliminary second-quarter data from bank call
reports, as discussed more fully later in the consumer credit section,
indicate further deterioration in asset quality--particularly for real
estate loans--as delinquency rates have risen to their highest levels of the

III-7
past seven years. The rise in real estate loan delinquencies, however,
would appear to be in loans other than residential mortgages, as other
evidence on residential mortgages at all lenders shows little change in
delinquencies in recent quarters.
Bank Financing
Financing problems in the banking sector have been mounting. Both the
GAO and CBO issued reports questioning the financial health of large banks
and the FDIC insurance fund. Recently these problems were further
highlighted by difficulties besetting Chase Manhattan. 1 In mid-September,
Chase encountered problems in the resetting of the coupon rate for a
subordinated issue, paying a very large premium over Treasury yields. The
growing disenchantment of investors with the banking sector had already been
evident in the short-term market. So far in 1990, there have been
27 downgradings of bank holding company commercial paper programs rated by
Moody's, accounting for more than half of all such actions. Facing a higher
cost of funds and investor skittishness about defaults, banking entities
have reduced substantially their outstanding commercial paper: The paper of
banks and their holding companies has fallen from $49 billion outstanding in
March to $37 billion recently, with nearly all of this decline having been
in issues with credit ratings less than A1/P1.
Moreover, banks have had little success replacing their commercial
paper funds with long-term financing in the bond market. Indeed, spreads
1. On September 17, Chase announced a number of measures to shore up its
financial position, including setting aside $650 million in additional
reserves, reducing staff by 5,000, and cutting its dividend. Despite these
efforts, on September 25, Moody's announced a downgrading of the debt of
Chase Manhattan bank and its holding company. The rating on commercial
paper was reduced to P3 and on subordinated issues to below-investment
grade.

between yields on bank debt and Treasury rates widened over the summer for
several large banking entities (chart). In 1990, only seven banking firms
have issued underwritten bonds with maturities of seven years or longer in
the U.S. public market, compared with an average of about 40 per year in the
past five years. Moreover, all but one of the bank companies that issued
long-term bonds in 1990 are viewed by the market as being strong or
improving credit risks. As yield spreads on long-term debt of lower-rated
banks have continued to widen, the prospects of raising tier-2 capital have
deteriorated further. On the brighter side, though, some banking firms have
had success issuing shorter maturity senior debt in the medium-term note
market and asset-backed securities through well-secured special purpose
subsidiaries.
Several banks reportedly have plans to raise capital with preferred
stock, but these plans could be derailed by the pronounced weakness in
equity prices. Underwritten offerings of common and preferred stock, which
were running well behind their 1989 pace through the first half of 1990,
have dried up completely since July. The Dow Jones index of money center
bank stock prices has dropped about 20 percent since August 1, and nearly
twice that amount since the end of 1989. In contrast, the S&P 500 is down
about 13 percent since both the first of August and the end of 1989.
Japanese banks also have been under increasing pressure, in part the
result of sharp declines in stock prices in Tokyo that have eroded their
capital bases. With several of these institutions having recently been
downgraded or under public notice that their ratings are being reviewed,
they are likely to become less aggressive lenders in the U.S. market.

III-ll
Indeed, lending by branches and agencies of Japanese banks slowed sharply in
July and August.
Business Finance
Total borrowing by nonfinancial firms has remained weak over the
intermeeting period, with moderate growth in bank loans and short-term paper
being accompanied by very light public bond issuance. Outstanding
commercial paper of nonfinancial corporations rose over the past month and a
half, reversing the decline registered in July, but growth remained subdued
in comparison with earlier in the year. Publicly underwritten offerings of
bonds by U.S. nonfinancial corporations fell in August to the slowest
monthly pace since May of 1984, and volume in September is very light as
well. While a few companies have tapped the private placement market for
financing, most would-be issuers reportedly are delaying new bond offerings
in anticipation of lower rates.
Issuance of junk bonds has remained sparse, with little likelihood of
near-term revival, especially in light of deteriorating performance of
outstanding issues. Thus far in 1990, defaults and distressed exchange
offers have totaled some $9-1/2 billion--exceeding the $8-3/4 billion for
all of 1989. These developments, coupled with the decline in equity prices,
have had a devastating effect on the secondary market prices of most junk
bonds, which dropped more than 3-1/2 percent on average in August and have
declined further in September. Until now, the RTC has been selling off only
moderate amounts from its junk bond portfolio, with sales totaling about
$550 million for 1990. Columbia Savings and Loan's proposal to sell its
junk bond portfolio to a private investment group for $3 billion fell

and Treasury bonds remain narrow, in part reflecting the reduced likelihood
that call features on corporates will be exercised by issuers in the near
term. The quality spread between indexes of Baa and Aaa nonfinancial
corporate bonds has increased nearly 20 basis points since the August
meeting, and although not wide historically, it is now larger than at any
time in the past two years.
Stock prices are off more than 4 percent from levels at the time of the
August FOMC, and prices of shares remain about 13 percent below their year-
end 1989 levels. Equity issuance in August and early September has been
running at less than half the monthly rate recorded earlier in the year,
with several firms announcing postponements of planned September offerings.
Retirements of equity are estimated to have picked up a bit in the third
quarter, as several large mergers were completed, so that nonfinancial
corporate leverage has risen somewhat further.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
Treasury borrowing in the third quarter is expected to exceed
$68 billion, against a budget deficit of nearly $58 billion. This
relatively large borrowing total reflects, in part, anticipated needs of the
RTC for additional working capital. The RTC had announced plans to resolve
77 thrift institutions over the quarter; so far 67 resolutions have been
completed and the RTC expects to reach its third-quarter goal.
The Treasury is meeting its third-quarter financing needs by raising
$29 billion in the bill market and $36 billion in the coupon market. Since

III-14
the beginning of the quarter, the gross sizes of the weekly bill auctions
have risen from $17.2 billion to $18.4 billion. In contrast, weekly
auctions of a year ago included only $14.4 billion of bills. Gross auction
sizes for coupon issues also has increased but, on average, by less than
that for bills. Further increases in gross auction sizes are anticipated
during the fourth quarter, particularly because the RTC's needs continue to
loom large.
In the market for securities of government-sponsored enterprises
spreads on debt relative to Treasury issues have remained narrow. Both the
Federal Home Loan Bank System and Freddie Mac have reduced their outstanding
levels of debt recently. Advances to member thrifts continued to wane, and
Freddie Mac used some of its cash to pay down a sizable portion of its
short-term indebtedness. Also, the Financial Assistance Corporation (a GSE
set up by Congress in 1988 to aid the financially troubled Farm Credit
System) has announced plans to issue $90 million of debt in late September,
which will bring its total debt to roughly a third of its $4 billion in
authority, with no foreseeable need to issue any more debt. In the equity
market for GSEs, prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are both down
about 8 percent since mid-August, substantially more than the decline in
broad market indexes. Proposals to increase regulation of, or reduce
implicit subsidies to, these entities are thought to be under consideration
at the budget summit. In addition, the softening real estate market also

the debt ceiling. Without additional legislation by October 3, the current
debt ceiling of $3.2 trillion is scheduled to revert to $3.12 trillion,
necessitating a Treasury paydown of maturing debt.

III-15
may be contributing to the relative decline in these two agency's stock
prices.
Municipal Securities
Over the intermeeting period, the Bond Buyer index of municipal yields
has followed Treasury rates, rising about 20 basis points. Moreover, as
investors generally have reacted to the greater economic uncertainty by
seeking safer havens for their funds, quality spreads within the market for
municipal securities have tended to widen. The spread between Aaa and Baa
yields for municipal securities of similar maturities increased about 15
basis points since early August.

f Forecast.
1. Includes issues for public and private purposes; also includes

2. Includes all refunding bonds, not just advance refundings.
The issuance of municipal securities jumped sharply in August, with
long-term volume of $10 billion being sold along with almost $7-1/2 billion
of short-term issues. Almost all of the long-term offerings were for new
capital, as refundings fell to only $700 million. The short-term volume was

III-16
largely composed of sizable tax and bond anticipation notes brought to
market by the states of California, Massachusetts, and Texas. So far in
September, the pace of new offerings appears to have moderated, with no
large short-term issues and a more subdued volume of long-term issuance.
The number of states and localities announcing revenue shortfalls has
been increasing and previously disclosed problems appear to be worsening.
Indeed, this month Philadelphia was forced to delay their $375 million stop-
gap sale of nine-month notes, because it could not secure a $50 million
letter of credit to replace an earlier agreement that was rescinded by the
Swiss Bank Corporation. With no other banks immediately willing to step in
and provide such credit enhancement, market participants suggested that the
issue might have had to offer a yield of more than 10 percent. (In
contrast, California's recent 10-month note sale, which carried Moody's
highest rating, sold at a yield of about 6 percent.) A successful note sale
in the near future is still possible; it would be needed to provide funds to
the city to enable it to avoid default later this year.
Other major cities also have begun to face major financial
difficulties, including New York, Washington, and Detroit. Detroit stands
to lose major sources of revenue if the final Census count shows that the
city's population has slipped below 1 million. The preliminary count
indicates that the city fell short by about 30,000 persons. Under state
law, Detroit would no longer be able to levy higher income taxes nor impose
any excise taxes on utility services.
Many of the state budget problems have been concentrated along the
eastern seaboard, and they are generally being attributed to unanticipated
shortfalls in tax revenues. The range of projected deficits runs from $1.5

III-17
billion for New York state to $380 million for Connecticut, with deficits
for the states of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and
Florida expected to fall somewhere in between. Thus far, however, only for
New York state and Massachusetts have these conditions led to reductions in
their credit ratings.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage debt growth appears to have remained subdued in the third
quarter. As noted above, the increase in real estate loans at commercial
banks slowed to about a 7-1/2 percent annual rate in the first two months of
the quarter, while the runoff of mortgage assets at SAIF-insured
institutions apparently has continued.
Despite the apparent decline in home mortgage lending, issuance of
federally related mortgage-backed pass-through securities has been brisk,
with such pools providing about two-thirds of the growth in residential
mortgage debt. In recent quarters, the repackaging of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac pass-throughs into CMO issues has picked up to an annual rate of
about $11 billion. A steepening of the yield curve in August and early
September has created a favorable environment for increased issuance of
these securities with differing maturity tranches, because of enhanced
opportunities for earning yield-curve "arbitrage" profits. Indeed, recent
trade reports indicate that, during August, a record volume of these
derivative products were priced for sale by underwriters.
In the past, a steeping of the yield curve has been associated with an
increase in the proportion of primary mortgage loan originations that carry
adjustable rates, and recently the share has risen to 30 percent from a low
of 20 percent at the beginning of the year (chart). During the month of

August, the initial rate advantage of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) over
fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) widened almost 50 basis points to 194 basis
points, largely reflecting a rise in contract rates on FRMs. Although rates
on FRMs have receded a bit lately, the latest ARM rate advantage remains
about 186 basis points--enough to suggest some further rise in the share of
ARMs.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding rose at a 7-1/2 percent annual
rate in July, after no change in June. The advance in July was driven
primarily by revolving credit gains, with outstanding automobile loans
declining in the month. Monthly changes have been bumpy this year, but the
growth trend in installment credit has been consistent with the decelerating
pattern of the past few years. Indeed, the rise of total consumer
installment credit through the first seven months of 1990 was at a meager 3
percent annual rate, with most of this slowdown resulting from paydowns of
auto credit. In contrast, revolving credit has grown at a 13 percent annual
rate so far this year--only slightly below its 14 percent pace in the
previous two years.
The downtrend in consumer credit growth during the past several years
has roughly paralleled a slackening in household purchases as the economic
expansion has matured. Tax considerations also may have been a factor as
well as growing difficulties in meeting debt-servicing obligations.
Consumers are highly leveraged by historical standards, as indicated by the
elevated relationship of installment debt to disposable income and by the 12
percent share of disposable income that is required to service existing
consumer credit indebtedness (chart). A still more comprehensive measure of

household debt servicing burden is provided by the measure that combines both
mortgage and consumer loan repayment requirements; this measure has risen to
around 19 percent in 1990--up almost 5 percentage points since its latest trough
in 1983. The increasing debt burden may be contributing to the continued rise
in personal bankruptcy filings.
Recent data on loan delinquencies present a mixed picture, with those at
commercial banks showing marked deterioration but others indicating little
change or even improvement. Call Report data on delinquencies for consumer
loans at banks with assets in excess of $300 million continued the steady climb
that began in mid-1988 (chart). The latest reading of 3.82 percent is the
highest in the eight-year period covered by these data. In contrast to this
picture of significant deterioration at commercial banks, other indicators show
unchanged or improved credit quality in the household sector. Delinquencies on
car loans at the captive auto finance companies have declined for three
consecutive quarters. Furthermore, unpublished data show that repossessions at
these companies, which had risen from late 1988 through early 1990, have since
receded and continue to be low. In the mortgage market, troubles with real
estate loans have not extended to home loans. Delinquencies (60 days and up) on
home mortgages were essentially unchanged in the second quarter, according to
data compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association. This series has been
generally on a downtrend since peaking in the first half of 1986; at 1.49
percent in the second quarter, the delinquency rate was at its lowest level
since 1980. At commercial banks, however, the delinquency rate on all real
estate loans (single and multi-family, farm, nonfarm-nonresidential, and
construction and development) in the second quarter continued the trend up that
began early last year.

in July. In addition, there was a 12 percent drop in exports of automotive
products (partly to Canada and partly to other countries).
The value of imports increased 4-1/2 percent in July. About two
thirds of the increase was in imported consumer goods (largely apparel,

from a drop in the value of oil imports. In addition, the value of
nonagricultural exports rose somewhat.

The value of total exports rose slightly in the second quarter. There
were increases (largely in quantity) of exported automotive products (to
Canada and to other areas), civilian aircraft, and consumer goods, that were
nearly offset by declines in agricultural shipments (primarily wheat,
soybeans, and cotton), computers, and industrial supplies. Exports of
machinery other than computers (accounting for about one-fourth of
nonagricultural exports) have been flat on average in recent monthsII- ImportsImports

apparently reflecting in part some slowing of economic growth in major
markets abroad.
The value of imports in the second quarter declined to levels recorded
in the second and third quarters of last year. Non-oil imports rose very
little in the second quarter (in both value and quantity); increases in the
value of automotive products from Canada, aircraft, and industrial supplies
(metals) were offset by declines in other categories. The drop in the value
of oil imports in the second quarter was about three-fourths in price and
one-fourth in quantity.

The decline in the price of imported oil in the second quarter and
July reflected continued strong OPEC production. Between January and July
the average price of imported oil dropped 27 percent (by more than $5.50 per
barrel). When the Persian Gulf OPEC producers announced a production
agreement in July, spot prices began to move up. Differences in price data
for imported oil reported by BLS and by the Commerce Department (in the
trade figures) occur because of differing commodity composition, sources of
reporting, and coverage.
World Oil Prices since the Iraqi Invasion
Since the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq (August 2), spot oil prices have
fluctuated sharply. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate has risen in
an erratic pattern from $31.50 per barrel (at the time of the last
Greenbook) to current levels of $38 per barrel. Prices generally declined

during the last half of August as it became clear that other members of OPEC
would increase production to offset much of the shortfall from Iraq and
Kuwait. After drifting in the $29-$31 per barrel range through the middle
of September, prices surged recently (at times approaching $40 per barrel),
as the market's perception of a heightened probability of war apparently led
to an increased demand for stocks.
Prices of Exports and Non-oil Imports
The rise in prices of exports was largely in agricultural products,
capital goods, and consumer goods. (See the table on the next page.)
Prices of non-oil imports in July decreased for the fourth consecutive
month, with much of the decline attributable to industrial supplies and
consumer durables. Note: Data for August will be released on September
27, and will be included in the Greenbook supplement.
For the second quarter, the decline in prices of non-oil imports was
largely in industrial supplies, automotive products, and to a lesser extent
capital goods. Part of the downward pressure on prices in the second
quarter was the effect of an appreciation of the dollar against the Japanese
yen that was not fully offset by the dollar's depreciation against other
currencies. For U.S. exports, price increases in the second quarter were
led by agricultural products with smaller increases in most other trade
categories. The exception was in nonagricultural industrial supplies where
price declines were recorded for most items.
U.S. Current Account in 1990-02
The U.S. current account deficit was $87.4 billion (seasonally
adjusted annual rate) in the second quarter, $0.7 billion larger than in the
revised first quarter (see table below). A reduction in the merchandise
trade deficit in the second quarter was offset by increased outflows of
investment income (both portfolio and direct) and unilateral transfers.

IV-7
Most of the change in net portfolio income was a reduction in receipts
reflecting both lower interest rates and a lower level of claims outstanding
during the quarter. For direct investment income, most of the change was a
small increase in payments from very depressed first-quarter levels. The
increase in net unilateral transfers was accounted for by government grants.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
In July, there were large recorded net capital inflows into the United
States, both official and private. (See Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table.) In contrast, in the first half of 1990, recorded net
capital inflows were small and the counterpart to the current account
deficit was a huge positive statistical discrepancy.

IV-8
Foreign official monetary authorities added over $2 billion to their
holdings in the United States in July (line 4). The countries adding to
their holdings were a diverse group, including Spain and Taiwan; holdings
of OPEC declined, as did the aggregate for the G-10 countries. Partial
information from the FRBNY indicates that G-10 holdings increased by about
$2 billion in August.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities (line 3)
amounted to more than $5 billion in July, larger than net purchases in any
other month in 1990. Financial centers in the Caribbean and the United
Kingdom accounted for the bulk of the net purchases, providing little
indication of the identity of the ultimate purchasers.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. corporate and government agency
bonds (line 2a) were also strong in July; Japan accounted for more than one-
quarter of the total, purchasing net $.7 billion in U.S. government agency
bonds. In August, however, issuance of bonds by U.S. corporations in both
the United States and Euromarkets declined sharply, suggesting that
subsequent capital inflows through this channel are likely to be smaller.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. stocks (line 2b) were also substantial
in July, the first month to show net purchases since last October. Japanese
residents accounted for about two-thirds of the total. U.S. net purchases
of foreign securities (line 2c) declined in July from the very high rate
recorded in May and June.
Banks reported large net inflows in July (line 1), reversing the
outflows reported in June; transactions with own offices outside the United
States accounted for most of this shift. However, on a monthly average
basis, claims of U.S. banking offices on their own foreign offices and IBFs
showed only small changes in July and August (see line 1 of the
International Banking Data table).

IV-10
The Department of Commerce recently released data on U.S. capital flows
in the second quarter of 1990. Foreign direct investment in the United
States was very small for the second successive quarter, amounting to $10.5
billion in the first half of 1990 compared with $38.4 billion in the first
half of 1989. Although there have been few huge takeovers by foreign
companies to date in 1990, partial information on the value of takeovers
does not indicate such a sharp decline and suggests that a change in funding
patterns may also have played a role. U.S. direct investment abroad in the
first half of 1990 was robust, although the second-quarter total was far
below the first quarter. Both plant and equipment expenditures by U.S.-
owned affiliates abroad and acquisitions of foreign firms remained strong.
The statistical discrepancy in the U.S. international transactions
accounts for the first half of 1990 amounted to more than $45 billion (not
at an annual rate). Part of this discrepancy is accounted for by the
failure of the accounts to include data on increases in foreign holdings of
U.S. currency. Information from a group of major banks indicates that the
pace of their net currency shipments abroad increased from $3.7 billion in
1989 to $6.8 billion in the first half of 1990 alone and another $4.2
billion in July and August combined. However, the size of the statistical
discrepancy for the first half indicates that there are other substantial
errors and omissions in the accounts in addition to omitted currency
shipments.

Foreign Exchange Markets
After having declined steadily between mid-June and the August 21 FOMC
meeting, the trade-weighted, foreign exchange value of the dollar against
the other G-10 currencies ended this intermeeting period little changed on
balance.
The dollar followed a sinusoidal pattern against the major European
currencies during the period, as the market's assessment of the short-term
stance of the Federal Reserve alternated between easing and holding steady.
Safe haven concerns may have provided some support for the dollar late in
the period.
While the dollar rose on balance against most of the major currencies
since the August FOMC meeting, it depreciated more than 6-1/4 percent
against the yen. The yen moved up in reaction to signs that economic
activity in Japan remains strong and indications that Japanese authorities
are keeping monetary conditions tight. On August 30 the Bank of Japan
raised the official discount rate 75 basis points to 6 percent, ratifying a
round of tightening that began in June. During the intermeeting period, the
interest rate on three-month CDs in Japan rose 35 basis points to 8.4
percent. The yield on the bellwether bond in Japan rose more than 60 basis
points to about 8.7 percent.
On balance, the dollar appreciated 1 percent against the mark and 3
percent against sterling. Sterling declined as expectations that the pound
would enter the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS in early September were
unrealized. The dollar firmed 1-3/4 percent against the Swiss franc, as
Swiss authorities moved to offset the additional monetary restraint caused
by the runup in the franc in early August with an easing of interest rates.
The three-month interbank rate in Switzerland declined 75 basis points

during the period to 8 percent. The dollar rose about 1-1/2 percent against
the Canadian dollar, as the Canadian dollar moved down from its 12-year high
against the U.S. dollar early in the period. Signs of weakness in Canadian
economic activity and an easing of interest rates in Canada prompted the
decline in the currency. The Canadian three-month interbank interest rate
declined about 55 basis points during the period to just above 12-1/2
percent. Also contributing to downward pressure on the Canadian dollar was
the surprise election victory of the New Democratic Party in Ontario.
Within the EMS, the lira and peseta declined relative to the other
currencies, as both economies were perceived to be relatively more
vulnerable than the other EMS countries to the recent oil price increases.
Furthermore, Italian authorities allowed interest rates to decrease during
the period. Since the August FOMC, the three-month interbank interest rate
in Italy fell more than 85 basis points to 10-3/4 percent. Comparable
interest rates in France and Germany were little changed.
Stock prices in the major industrialized countries, shown in the
accompanying table, continued to move down in the intermeeting period, as
oil price increases associated with the Iraqi invasion on August 1 prompted
downward adjustments in prospective earnings for oil-consuming businesses
worldwide. Contributing to the downward pressure on German stock prices was
some disappointment with the increasing cost of unification and the pace of
economic development in East Germany. Stock prices in the United Kingdom,
the Netherlands, and Canada--countries that are net exporters of energy
products--fared better than the rest. However, perceptions that economic
activity is slowing in the United Kingdom and especially in Canada probably
prevented stronger performances by stock prices in those countries.

IV-15
There was no Desk
activity for official U.S. accounts.
The price of gold moved down nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting
period from its peak levels in mid-August to just under $402. However, the
price of gold is still up more than 8-1/4 percent from the beginning of
August.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Real GDP growth slowed in the second-quarter in most major foreign
industrial countries. In Germany and Japan, however, this slowing was from
exceptionally rapid first-quarter rates, and recent monthly indicators
suggest that activity remains robust. In the other G-7 countries growth
does not appear to have rebounded since the second quarter. Economic reform
programs have contributed to declines in output in most East European
economies. A shift in demand towards western goods in East Germany caused
industrial production to fall sharply, but contributed to an increase in
economic activity in West Germany.
Consumer price inflation increased sharply in August in most
industrial countries, as higher prices for oil added roughly 1/4 percent to
consumer-price indices. Governments appear to have decided not to interfere
with the pass-through of oil price increases to consumers. In July, before
the oil-price increase, inflation rates were relatively stable in most
industrial countries.
The Japanese current account surplus declined in July, reflecting
strong import demand. In Canada and the United Kingdom, external deficits
narrowed due to a weakening of economic activity. In Germany, the
Bundesbank began publishing consolidated East and West German balance of
payments statistics, which showed for July a German current account surplus

IV-16
of $36 billion (a.r.), roughly equal to the West German surplus in July
1989.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, real GDP (s.a.) grew 3.6 percent
(a.r.) in the second quarter, down from a revised 11.4 percent in the first
quarter. The slowing of growth from the first to the second quarter was
accounted for entirely by a sharp swing in the contribution of the external
sector from positive to negative. Domestic demand growth increased to 10
percent in the second quarter, led by strong growth in consumption and
investment. Relative to its level a year earlier, second-quarter GDP was up
7.5 percent. Recent economic indicators suggest on balance that the pace of
economic activity has been rapid, despite increases in Japanese interest
rates. In July, industrial production (s.a.) rose 1.5 percent to a level
6.7 percent above that of a year earlier. Retail sales (s.a.) fell in July,
however, by 1.2 percent, and housing starts moved down in July for the
second consecutive month. The index of capacity utilization (s.a.) rose
1.4 percent in July returning to near its record level of May. The labor
market continued to be tight as the unemployment rate (s.a.) edged down to
2.1 percent in July. Following two sluggish months, new machinery orders
(s.a.) rose 16 percent in July to their highest level this year. A new
quarterly survey of business conditions by the Bank of Japan (conducted in
early August) revealed that business confidence is still high and capital
spending plans by leading corporations remain strong.
In August, the Tokyo consumer price index (n.s.a.) rose 0.3 percent to
a level 3.0 percent above its level a year earlier, up from 2.5 percent in
July. The wholesale price index (n.s.a.) in August rose 0.3 percent to a
level 1.1 percent above that of a year earlier. These increases were
attributed mainly to higher oil and food prices.

IV-20
The Japanese current account surplus narrowed in July by nearly $2
billion (s.a.) to $1.8 billion, its smallest value since December; the
merchandise trade surplus declined in August to $3.5 billion as exports
edged down and imports increased.
In West Germany, real GNP fell 3.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second
quarter, after increasing a revised 15.4 percent in the first quarter.
However, compared with its level a year earlier, GNP was up 3.4 percent in
the second quarter. The decline in the second quarter was mostly the result
of a correction in seasonally adjusted construction activity, which fell 13
percent, after increasing 20 percent in the first quarter, due to unusually
mild winter weather. Exports of goods and services (s.a.) also contributed
to the sharp swing in GNP, falling 3.1 percent in the second quarter, after
increasing 8.6 percent in the first quarter.
Since the establishment of the German Economic and Monetary Union on
July 1, there appears to have been a shift in demand in East Germany towards
western goods, causing economic activity to slow in East Germany and expand
in West Germany. In West Germany, most indicators of economic activity in
July showed considerable strength. The volume of retail sales (n.s.a.)
jumped 8.4 percent to 14 percent above the level a year earlier; industrial
production (n.s.a.) in July rose to 5.1 percent above the level a year
earlier, with increases in nearly all sectors. Domestic orders (n.s.a.),
which include orders from East Germany, increased 8.6 percent, while foreign
orders declined slightly from their level a year earlier. Unemployment
(s.a.) fell to 7.2 percent in August, down from 7.3 percent where it had
remained since March.
In contrast, economic activity in East Germany contracted sharply in
July and August. Preliminary figures, provided by the Bundesbank, indicate
that East German industrial production (n.s.a.) fell 35 percent in July to

IV-21
42 percent below its level a year earlier. East German industrial
production has declined in every month since March, falling in the second
quarter by 9.3 percent from its level a year earlier. Official unemployment
in East Germany rose to 4.2 percent in August, from virtually zero at the
end of 1989 and 1.6 percent in June immediately prior to monetary
unification. Workers engaged in government-subsidized "short-time" work
increased to 16.1 percent in August from 7.6 percent in July. A substantial
portion of "short-time" workers, 90 percent by some estimates, are believed
to be unemployed in all but name. There were indications in August that
conditions may be stabilizing, partial data suggest that East German tax
collections increased significantly, and that the financial position of
state-owned enterprises improved.
In West Germany, in August, consumer prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.3
percent to a level 2.8 percent above that of a year earlier in August, up
from 2.4 percent in July. Producer prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.6 percent in
August, up 1.9 percent from the level a year earlier. These price increases
were largely due to higher oil prices. In East Germany consumer prices in
August were 5.1 percent below their average level for all of 1989. Prices
have fluctuated significantly since monetary unification, rising 0.4 percent
(n.s.a.) in August and 7.5 percent in July, after falling 12.1 percent in
June.
The West German current account (s.a.a.r.) surplus fell $20 billion in
the second quarter to $45.3 billion, compared with $55.7 billion for all of
1989, due primarily to a sharp decline in exports. In July, the Bundesbank
began reporting balance of payments statistics for East and West Germany
combined. The combined German trade balance (n.s.a.a.r.) was $73 billion in
July compared with a West German trade surplus of $67 billion in July 1989.

IV-22
The combined German current account (n.s.a.a.r.) was $36.1 billion in July,
roughly the same as West Germany's current account surplus in July 1989.
Through August, West German M3 (s.a.) grew 4.5 percent (a.r.) from its
level in 1989 Q4, near the bottom of the Bundesbank's target range of 4 to 6
percent for the year. The Bundesbank recently announced that it will not
alter its monetary growth target for 1990. It will continue to focus on
monetary aggregates for West Germany, based on estimates of the West German
share of total DM currency outstanding, because reliable data from East
German banks are not yet available. The Bundesbank has stated that it will
pay less attention to monetary aggregates in setting German monetary policy
because of these problems.
In response to the deteriorating situation in East Germany, the West
German federal government is expected to approve a third supplemental budget
for 1990 with additional expenditures of roughly DM 20 billion, rasing the
projected 1990 budget deficit by 60 percent. These funds will go,
primarily, to finance additional public sector deficits in East Germany.
Economic activity in France appears to have slowed in the second
quarter. Marketable GDP (s.a.) (a preliminary indicator of total GDP) grew
only 0.4 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, after a rise of 2 percent in
the first quarter. The slowing of GDP in the second quarter is primarily
due to a slowing of investment spending, and to poor export performance,
partly related to a strike at a British supplier for Airbus. Recent
indicators suggest activity has weakened slightly; average retail sales
(s.a.) for July and August fell 2.2 percent from the average for May and
June.
Inflation increased in August. The consumer price index (n.s.a.) rose
0.6 percent, compared with 0.3 percent in July, and was up 3.5 percent from

IV-23
its level a year earlier. Increases in energy prices accounted for two-
thirds of the August price rise.
On September 12, the government announced its 1991 budget. It
envisages a small decrease in the central government budget deficit, from a
projected 1.4 percent of GDP in 1990 to 1.2 percent in 1991. The budget
also contains several supply-side tax cuts, including a reduction in the tax
rate on reinvested profits.
The U.K. economy continues to be beset by slumping activity and rising
inflation. Real GDP (s.a.) grew 1.4 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter,
after rising 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 1990. This slowing was
primarily the result of an 11.9 percent drop in investment, which was only
partly offset by increases in government spending and net exports. In July,
industrial output (s.a.) fell 3.7 percent to stand 0.2 percent above its
level a year earlier. Unemployment (s.a.) rose again in August to 5.8
percent, slightly above its low of 5.6 percent in March.
Retail prices (n.s.a.) rose 1 percent in August, to a level 10.6
percent above that of a year earlier, the largest increase since February
1982. Roughly a third of the increase was due to higher oil prices; also
important was a rise in food prices. Retail prices excluding the effects of
mortgage interest payments and the poll tax increased 7.9 percent in August.
Output prices for manufactured goods (n.s.a.) rose 5.8 percent above their
level a year earlier. In July, the increase in average earnings (a.r.)
remained constant at 10 percent.
The cumulative trade and current account deficits for the first 8
months of the year were $22.6 billion and $20 billion respectively, compared
with a trade deficit of $27.9 billion and a current account deficit of $21.6
billion in the same period of last year.

IV-24
In Italy, recent indicators, such as August auto sales, suggests that
economic activity remains weak. Industrial production (n.s.a.) in June was
only one percent above its level a year earlier. Consumer prices (n.s.a.)
in August rose 6.3 percent from their level a year earlier, up from the 5.7
percent increase in July, largely as a result of the rise in oil prices.
After considering a decrease in the excise tax on petroleum products the
government of Italy has decided to pass oil price increases on fully to
consumers.
In Canada, a decline in real GDP (s.a.a.r.) of 1.7 percent in the
second quarter resulted from a 13.6 percent fall in investment and a 1.8
percent decline in consumption. These declines were partially offset by a
rise in net exports as real exports increased 18 percent, while real imports
rose only 7.8 percent. Recent monthly indicators suggest continued weakness
in economic activity. Unemployment (s.a.) jumped 0.5 percent in August to
8.3 percent. Housing starts (s.a.a.r.) fell 7.0 percent in August, and new
motor vehicle sales (s.a.) declined 1.0 percent in July.
In Canada, consumer price (n.s.a.) were unchanged in August, and the
index remained 4.1 percent above its level a year earlier. Moderate wage
settlements in the second quarter also suggest inflationary pressures are
lessening. Bank of Canada Governor John Crow indicated that monetary policy
may be eased due to the weakness in economic activity and lessening of
inflationary pressures.
The left-leaning New Democratic Party unexpectedly won the provincial
election in Ontario. Although the NDP platform called for major changes in
Ontario's economic policy comments from NDP leaders after the election were
cautious about the nature and pace of implementing new policies.

IV-25
Developments in East European Economies
In Poland, data for August indicates a possible recovery in economic
activity from recent recessionary levels, along with continued declines in
monthly inflation rates. Industrial sales by state-owned firms in July and
August were 18 percent below their levels a year earlier, an improvement
over the 30 percent average decline registered in the first six months of
1990. In August, the monthly inflation rate was only 1.8 percent (n.s.a.),
continuing the downward trend. Unemployment increased to 6.1 percent in
August.
Poland has met all IMF performance criteria as of the month of June,
and in August obtained a World Bank loan of $300 million to support
enterprise restructuring and banking reform.
During 1990, Hungary made an impressive switch from trade within the
CMEA to trade with hard-currency areas. Fully 70 percent of trade was with
the hard-currency area during the first six months of 1990, up from 58
percent in 1989. The hard-currency trade surplus in the first six months of
1990 was $550 million, contributing to a hard-currency current account
surplus of $200 million, compared with a deficit of $986 million for the
same period in 1989. However, an offsetting contraction of trade to soft-
currency areas (principally the Soviet Union) contributed to a decline of 8
percent in industrial production in the first half of 1990. Consumer prices
rose 26 percent in June from their level a year earlier, exceeding the IMF
objective of 20 percent for the year as a whole.
Disagreement over the approach to economic reforms among officials are
evident in the new government of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic
(CSFR). President Vaclav Havel wants to maintain a measured pace of reform
that avoids disruptive adjustment and assures an adequate safety net.
Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus, joined recently by Prime Minister Marian

IV-26
Calfa, is promoting a program of rapid price liberalization and currency
convertibility for current account transactions beginning on January 1,
1991. The CSFR recently rejoined the IMF and World Bank.
Gross industrial output fell 3 percent in the first half of 1990,
compared with a year earlier, in part because declining trade within the
CMEA (roughly 65 percent of the total) outweighed increased trade with the
West. Trade with CMEA countries fell 15.3 percent in the first six months
of 1990, while overall trade fell 5.9 percent. CSFR authorities estimate
that German unification may cost CSFR about $375-$500 million in lost trade.
Yugoslavia was out of compliance with IMF performance criteria as of
the June review, despite sharp declines in inflation and rising
international reserves, because it exceeded its public spending targets.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
During the first week of September, the Argentine government announced
a series of additional fiscal measures to bolster its stabilization program
initiated in March 1990. The IMF and Brazil agreed to a letter of intent in
mid-September for an SDR 1.449 billion (approximately U.S. $2 billion)
stand-by arrangement through February 1992. In Venezuela, the holders of at
least 90 percent of the public-sector external debt to commercial banks have
committed to participate in the country's financing package. Mexico's
current account is expected to improve this year, mainly due to increased
oil revenues. Mexico's inflation has risen in recent months, as a result of
increases in administered prices and a fiscal policy stance that is probably
not restrictive enough. The Chilean government reached a rescheduling
agreement with creditor banks in late September. On September 11, the Paris
Club rescheduled Morocco's bilateral debt on precedent-setting terms.
Individual country notes. During the first week of September, the
Argentine government announced a series of additional fiscal adjustment

IV-27
measures to bolster its stabilization program initiated in March 1990. The
measures include sharp hikes in public sector prices, the payment of 10-year
bonds to eliminate domestic arrears to suppliers, the cutting of services
provided by public enterprises to customers with overdue payments, the
reduction of public payrolls, the re-negotiation of collective bargaining
agreements with public enterprise employees, and the centralization of
control over public enterprises under the Ministry of Economy.
The announcement of new fiscal measures followed Central Bank actions
at the end of August to tighten liquidity by raising reserve requirements
from 82 percent to 86 percent on demand deposits held at private banks and
from 88.5 percent to 100 percent on demand deposits held at publicly owned
banks. In response, short-term interest rates rose to over 25 percent
(monthly basis) in the first week of September compared with under 15
percent in the previous week; in the past week these interest rates declined
to between 10 percent and 15 percent due to scheduled repayments of short-
term central bank obligations. The austral price of the dollar has fallen
from 6400 to 5800 since the end of August. This exchange rate is the same
in nominal terms as that registered at the end of February, but consumer
prices have risen 180 percent since then. As a result, the real exchange
rate is at its most appreciated level since early 1982.
The tightening of fiscal and monetary policy represents a response to
the failure to make sufficient progress toward inflation reduction and
fiscal adjustment in recent months. After registering 10.8 percent in July,
the monthly inflation rate rose to 15.3 percent in August. It is expected to
be at least as high as that in September, as a result of recent public
sector price hikes.
The IMF management and Brazil agreed to a letter of intent in mid-
September for an SDR 1.449 billion (approximately U.S. $2 billion) stand-by

IV-28
arrangement through February 1992. The stand-by program may be approved by
the Executive Board in October. The IMF's formal approval of the letter of
intent has been held up pending progress in the Brazilian government's
negotiations with commercial bank creditors. Brazilian debt in the
secondary market has been recently selling for about 20 cents on the dollar,
compared with 17 cents in mid-August.
Inflation in Brazil has hovered around 10-13 percent per month since
June, despite continued treasury cash surpluses and a tight monetary policy.
The monetary base rose less than 3 percent in August. Interest rates have
been high in real terms since late August in response to news that monetary
policy would be substantially tighter after mid-September. The overnight
rate rose from 14 percent on August 31 (monthly basis) to 22 percent on
September 11, and was 26 percent on September 21.
Industrial output and sales continue to be substantially lower than
they were at the beginning of the year, although industrial output
stabilized in July. The fall in industrial output and a lower agricultural
harvest this year are expected to reduce real GDP by between 3 and 5
percent.
In late August, Congress failed to override President Collor's July
veto of a wage bill that would have effectively reintroduced wage
indexation. The failure to override the veto was seen as a victory for
President Collor's anti-inflation effort. Although employers have granted
some wage increases since the program began, real wages of most workers,
particularly government workers, are believed to be substantially lower than
they were at the beginning of the program. The current recession and
prospects that economic activity will continue to be depressed has limited
strike activity.

IV-29
Brazil continues to register trade surpluses despite a significant real
appreciation of the cruzeiro. The real effective exchange rate appreciated
24 percent in 1989 and a further 29 percent in the first quarter of 1990.
The cruzeiro has appreciated slightly against the dollar in real terms since
the stabilization program was announced in mid-March. Brazil's trade
surplus was about $1 billion in August. The accumulated surplus for the
first eight months of 1990 was $8.5 billion, compared with a $12 billion
surplus over the same period in 1989.
In Venezuela, the holders of at least 90 percent of the public-sector
external debt to commercial banks have committed to participate in the
country's financing package. The new-money option (with a 20 percent
increase in exposure) was chosen by holders of $5.7 billion in base debt,
more than was expected when the term sheet was distributed last March. The
par-bond option (carrying a fixed interest rate of 6-3/4 percent) attracted
$6.9 billion in base debt. $1.6 billion in base debt was allocated to a
principal-reduction-bond option with a 30 percent discount of principal at
13/16 over LIBOR, and holders of $1.4 billion chose to accept a buyback at
45 cents per dollar of face value. Commitments are still being accepted,
and the package is expected to close later this year. Technical problems
with the government budget caused Venezuela to accumulate $300 million in
interest arrears to banks in August and September, but these arrears were
cleared in the second half of September.
The limited monthly economic data available suggest that Venezuela's
sharp recession, which brought about an 8 percent decline in real GDP in
calendar 1989, has bottomed out. Motor vehicle sales, for example, were 46
percent higher during the first eight months of 1990 than in the same period
last year, and 19 percent greater in August than in July. After declining
sharply in 1989, inflation has been stable through August. The Caracas CPI

IV-30
rose 3.2 percent in August. Since mid-August, domestic interest rates have
remained roughly constant and are moderately positive in real terms. The
bolivar has remained at about 48 per U.S. dollar, with the government
reportedly intervening to prevent capital reflows from bringing about a
nominal appreciation.
Venezuela is gradually increasing petroleum output from the 2 mbd level
that prevailed in the first half of 1990 to a projected level of 2.5 mbd
by the end of the year. As a result of the recent surge in oil prices and
production increase, the projection for the current account surplus in 1990
has been revised upward from $1 billion to $4 billion.
Mexico stands to earn about $1.6 billion more from crude oil exports
this year than appeared likely before the onset of the Gulf crisis. As a
result, a $1.3 billion current account deficit will probably result in the
second half of 1990. The current account deficit reached $3.2 billion in
the first half of 1990, when the oil export price averaged about $14 per
barrel. The improved oil export earnings will strengthen public sector
revenues, but pressures to increase public expenditures are strong, partly
because the rate of inflation exceeds the forecast on which the budget was
based, and partly because Congressional elections are scheduled for next
July. Mexico met with ample margin the fiscal performance criteria of its
EFF program for March 31 and June 30, but compliance with the year-end
criteria is not assured.
In August, the CPI was 28 percent higher than its level a year earlier,
compared with a 20 percent increase in the 12 months ending in December
1989. The rise in inflation reflects adjustments in administered prices
aimed at correcting relative price distortions and a fiscal policy stance
that is probably not restrictive enough. The sharp decline in interest
rates under way since mid-March came to an end in mid-August. The 28-day

IV-31
Treasury bill rate was 30.3 percent at the September 18 auction, up 100
basis points from four weeks earlier. The rate had declined 18 percentage
points from mid-March to mid-August. The government sold less than 60
percent of the amount of debt it offered at the September 18 auction;
prospects for higher inflation resulting from the Gulf crisis caused the
market to expect higher rates than the authorities were willing to pay.
Private capital inflows contributed to a rise in international reserves of
almost $300 million in the first seven months of the year, in spite of the
large current account deficit.
The Chilean government and creditor banks reached a rescheduling
agreement in late September. The agreement reschedules $1.8 billion in debt
due between 1991 and 1993 over a 7-year period (including 3 years of grace)
at 13/16 over LIBOR (7/8 over LIBOR for Chile's previous new money
packages). Banks have also indicated an interest, in principle, to provide
$320 million in 5-year bonds at 1.5-1.75 percentage points over LIBOR. The
new bonds, if issued, will signal progress towards Chile's return to
voluntary capital markets.
On September 11, Paris Club creditors granted Morocco the most generous
repayment terms offered to a lower middle-income country, following up on
proposals for more generous terms that were discussed during the Houston
summit in July. Similar terms were granted to Congo, El Salvador, and
Honduras. About $1 billion of debt was rescheduled, with payments on
official development assistance loans extended to 20 years, including 10
years of grace, and non-development assistance loans were rescheduled over
15 years, with 8 years of grace. This rescheduling extends through the
first quarter of 1991, when Morocco's current IMF stand-by arrangement
expires. Morocco is negotiating with the IMF for an EFF to follow the
stand-by. Commercial banks have already reached an agreement with Morocco

IV-32
that will enable the country to engage in debt- and debt-service reduction
options after an EFF arrangement is in place and certain conditions are met,
such as remaining current on interest payments and establishing a debt-for-
equity program.
