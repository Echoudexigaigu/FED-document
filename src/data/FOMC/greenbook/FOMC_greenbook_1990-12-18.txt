The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Incoming data suggest that economic activity has fallen appreciably in
the past couple of months. The motor vehicle and construction sectors have
been especially weak, and the downturn appears to have affected a broad
range of other industries to some degree. Consumer and business confidence
evidently has been at a low ebb, owing in part to concerns about the
consequences of the Gulf situation; consumer spending apparently has been
weak, and businesses have been moving aggressively to avoid an inventory
buildup.
On the price front, the inflationary effects of the oil price shock
have continued to dominate the incoming data. Consumer energy prices jumped
further in October, and higher fuel and feedstock costs have begun to spill
over into the prices of other goods and services. Prices of non-oil imports
also have risen noticeably, owing to the depreciation of the dollar.
Despite the substantial increases in living costs this year, wage gains seem
to have moderated a bit in recent months, under the influence of
deteriorating business and labor market conditions.
Labor Markets
After a progressive weakening during the first three quarters of this
year, labor market conditions deteriorated sharply in October and November.
Private payrolls declined 270,000 in November after a downward-revised drop
of 206,000 in October. The civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.9 percent
last month. Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers in
private industry edged up in November following a precipitous October
decline (chart); still, the October-November average was 1-1/4 percent below

the level in the third quarter (not at an annual rate). Since the November
survey week, initial claims for unemployment insurance have fluctuated
around 450,000.
The employment decline in November was widespread across industries.
The diffusion index of employment change over a three-month span in
356 private industries declined to 36.5 percent, its third month below the
50 percent mark and its lowest reading since 1982. The largest job losses
occurred in the goods-producing sector. Construction and manufacturing shed
60,000 and 200,000 jobs, respectively. Manufacturing as a whole has
eliminated about 535,000 jobs since last December; about one-half of this
decline (270,000 jobs) has occurred in the past two months. In the motor
vehicles industry--where employment moved down about 20,000 jobs in the
first three quarters of 1990--some 55,000 layoffs occurred in November. The
service-producing sector, which earlier in the year had generated most of
the employment gains in the economy, registered a small employment loss in
November. Retail trade lost 70,000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis,
with hiring lower than usual at the start of the holiday season. Health
services was one of the few industries to post significant employment gains.
In the household survey, nonagricultural employment fell 470,000 in
November. The number of unemployed persons rose nearly 300,000, and with
the weakness in labor demand, the labor force participation rate continued
to decline. Most of the newly unemployed appear to have been job losers,
not entrants into the labor force; as a result, job losers as a percent of
1. Potential labor force entrants have been more discouraged recently.
According to the Conference Board's November consumer confidence survey,
only 14 percent of respondents believe jobs to be plentiful, down from about
25 percent this summer and 35 percent in early 1989.

household employment moved up to 3.1 percent in November, the highest since
mid-1987 (chart). Demographically, the increase in the unemployment rate
largely reflected increased joblessness among people 25 years and older; in
contrast, in September and October the unemployment rate for this group had
remained about flat. In addition, the number of persons working part-time
for economic reasons rose in November.
Other labor market indicators also displayed significant weakness in
recent months. The Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising,
which had been declining steadily since the turn of the year, began a
sharper decline in July. In addition, according to the Manpower, Inc.,
Employment Outlook Survey of plans to hire in the first quarter of 1991, the
number of firms intending to reduce their workforces exceeds the number of
firms intending to increase their workforces. This is the first time since
1983 that the net number of hiring firms was negative.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector as a whole grew only
0.2 percent in the third quarter (a large downward revision from the
preliminary estimate of 1.6 percent) reflecting flat output and a small
decline in hours worked. In contrast, output per hour in the manufacturing
sector increased at a 5.1 percent annual pace, as firms moved aggressively
to cut costs. In both the broader measure and in manufacturing separately,
the levels of productivity are below their estimated, cyclically adjusted
trends (chart); historically, this relation has been associated with efforts
to trim workforces, which certainly has been the pattern this fall.
Scattered reports of salary plans for 1991 do not suggest a major
downshift from what firms budgeted in 1990. However, announcements of pay
freezes and other efforts to restrain compensation costs at companies facing

difficulty suggest that the weakness in the economy is having some effect.
The November reading on average hourly earnings of production or
nonsupervisory workers points in that direction. Because this series has
limited coverage and does not adjust for industry or occupational shifts, it
must be read cautiously as an indicator of general patterns. That said, it
is noteworthy that average hourly earnings were flat on average in October
and November, and that for the three months ending in November, they
increased 1.6 percent at an annual rate, a slowdown of about
2-1/2 percentage points from the pace earlier in the year.

Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial activity has declined sharply in the current quarter. The
available indicators suggest that total industrial production in November
contracted more severely last month than the 0.8 percent drop in October.
In November, motor vehicle assemblies fell 2-1/4 million units to
8.4 million units (annual rate; FRB seasonals)--an 18 percent underbuild
from the plans that were announced at the beginning of the month. The drop

rubber and plastics, may have reduced November IP growth by around
1 percentage point.
The widespread declines in production worker hours and in the available
physical product data suggest that production outside of the motor vehicle
sector contracted in November for the third consecutive month. As in
October, factory labor input was especially weak in industries related to
construction and household durables. Production of business equipment
excluding motor vehicles also appears to have declined a bit further in
November. The available physical product data indicate a large drop in
electricity generation, owing mainly to unseasonably warm weather, but also
to declines in the production of lumber, plywood, gasoline, and coal.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing has plunged, and operating rates
at most advanced processing industries are moving below their averages over
the 1967-89 period. The utilization rate for primary processing industries
likely fell again in November, reflecting widespread production curtailments
among these basic industries.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal income growth has slowed substantially, and real income has
been falling. In October (the most recent data available), nominal personal
income rose $5-3/4 billion at an annual rate, well below the average monthly
change of $22-1/2 billion observed through the first three quarters of this
year. The growth in overall personal income would have been even weaker in
October but for a large increase ($7-1/4 billion at an annual rate) in

II-12
transfer income. The wage and hours figures for November imply another
month of very slow income growth.
Real PCE fell 0.7 percent in October, owing in part to a large drop in
expenditures on new cars and trucks. Spending on goods other than motor
vehicles fell 0.7 percent, reflecting a sharp reduction in real outlays for
gasoline and fuel oil and a further decline in expenditures for furniture,
which were at their lowest level this year. Outlays for energy-related
services (electricity and natural gas) declined a bit in October, while PCE
for other services increased 0.3 percent, about the average monthly pace in
the first three quarters of 1990.
The personal saving rate edged up in October, but remained at a low
level--3.8 percent. Prior to the invasion of Kuwait, the personal saving
rate had averaged 4.9 percent in 1990. Thus, as of October, consumers had
not cut back their spending as sharply as their income had fallen. Such
behavior could be consistent either with a sluggish adjustment of spending
to changes in income, or with an expectation that the runup in energy prices
will be reversed shortly and real income growth restored; sentiment indexes
suggest that consumers are pessimistic about the future, and thus would tend
to support the former explanation of the low saving rate.
2. The October increase in transfer income reflected three special
factors: First, payments to Japanese-Americans in compensation for their
internment during World War II accounted for about $3-1/2 billion at an
annual rate. Another $200 million is scheduled to be spent during the rest
of the current fiscal year; according to an analyst at BEA, about half of
this--or $1-1/4 billion at an annual rate--was scheduled to be disbursed in
November, and the rest is scheduled to be paid between now and March.
Second, the State of Alaska made a large payment to citizens of the state
under its program of remitting earnings from a fund of accumulated oil tax
revenues; this factor accounted for about $1-1/2 billion of the October
increase. Third, disbursements under the food stamp program increased about
$1 billion at an annual rate, reflecting the annual adjustment of the
program's benefit schedule.

II-13
Consumer sentiment remained at depressed levels in November. After
registering sizable declines in each of the preceding three months, the
University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment ticked up slightly.
But, at 66, the level of the index remained about 25 points below the
average seen during 1989 and early 1990 and was comparable to the readings
taken during the 1980 and 1981-82 recessions. The Conference Board's
Consumer Confidence Index slipped a bit lower in November and also was at
recession levels.
Pending receipt later this week of the November retail sales release,
there is little hard information on which to base an assessment of recent
consumer spending. Chain store reports for last month, Beige Book stories,
and the Board staff's conversations with major retailing concerns all
suggest, however, a distinctly soft picture. Although retailers evidently
were cautious when they placed their orders prior to the holiday season,
sales have been sluggish enough to force heavier discounting than had been
planned.
Autos and Light Trucks
Total unit sales of new cars and light trucks moved down notably in
November from the October pace, to about a 12-3/4 million unit rate. Sales
of domestically built cars were at a 6-1/4 million unit annual pace, down
about 3/4 million units from October, while sales of imported cars fell to a
2-1/4 million unit annual rate. Sales of light trucks were flat in
November, with a further decline in sales of domestically produced models
offset by a pickup in imports.
Auto sales at the beginning of the 1991 model year would have been even
weaker had there not been an increase in fleet sales. Fleet purchases often

II-14
are made under an agreement that the manufacturer will buy back some of the
cars at a contracted price. This year, manufacturers broadened buy-back
programs to cover all vehicles in the fleet purchase, up from the 25 percent
or 50 percent coverage ratio of previous programs. After the cars are
repurchased, they are sold at auction. Under a relatively recent
arrangement, the automakers' own dealers have the right of first access in
these auctions. When fleet cars are purchased by the auto dealers at
auction, they go into the dealers' inventories as used cars. Nonetheless,
these "nearly new" cars are seen by customers as close substitutes for new
cars, in part because they have low mileage and still carry the
manufacturer's warranty. Given the lower prices and close substitutability,
these "nearly new" cars probably reduce household demand for new cars.
While retail demand for new motor vehicles has weakened this year, the
auto companies reportedly have used fleet sales as a short-term strategy for
maintaining production at a faster pace than would otherwise have been
possible. Eventually, the increased volume of fleet sales (and the reported
move of auto rental companies to "cycle" their fleets back to the
manufacturers more frequently) will result in more "nearly new" cars on
dealers' lots. This factor apparently has combined with reduced credit
availability and concerns about the economy to cause dealers to trim their
orders for new cars. As a result, manufacturers are cutting their
production schedules sharply even though inventories of new cars are well in
line with conventional rules of thumb.
3. The repurchase price is calculated as a function of depreciation, which
is figured at 40 cents per mile. At Ford and General Motors, the minimum
purchase to qualify for the buyback program is 10 vehicles; at Chrysler, the
minimum is 250 vehicles.

Inventories of domestically built cars were at about 1.35 million
units--65 days' supply--at the end of November. Production of domestically
built cars dropped 1 million units at an annual rate in November to a
5-1/2 million unit pace (BEA seasonals). Since the beginning of November,
the domestic automakers have slashed their assembly schedules for the
five-month period from November through March by 1/2 million units at an
annual rate. Moreover, schedules in the first quarter of 1991 may be pared
back still further, with manufacturers extending the traditional holiday
shutdowns.
Housing Markets
Housing activity continued on a downward path through October. Total
housing starts fell to an annual rate of 1.04 million units, while building
permit issuance also was down sharply. The multifamily sector accounted for

almost all of the October decline. Starts of multifamily units in October
were at the lowest level in the 31 years for which data are available; in
addition to high rental vacancy rates and declining real rents, regulatory
restrictions on construction lending and uncertainty about federal
requirements for handicapped access have been depressing influences on
4apartment construction this year.
In the single-family sector, starts have been reasonably stable since
early summer. However, permits, which are statistically more reliable, have
drifted lower, suggesting that there has been further erosion of building
activity. Demand for new single-family homes has declined noticeably this
year; both the volume of new home sales and quality-adjusted prices have
been weak, a pattern that points to soft demand rather than to shortages of
construction credit as the primary cause of the slow pace of production.
Reduced demand is evident in the market for existing homes as well:
Existing home sales fell in both September and October. This pattern would
be consistent with an unwillingness of sellers to cut prices as much as bid
prices have fallen. The increased caution on the part of prospective buyers
of both new and existing homes likely reflects declining real incomes,
general economic uncertainty, and reduced expectations of investment returns
from home ownership. Both the University of Michigan and the Conference
Board found less positive attitudes toward homebuying in October and
November; the Michigan survey found attitudes less favorable than at any
time in the last six years.
4. Most multifamily developers starting projects this fall will be subject
to new federal regulations regarding handicapped access. However, the final
regulations have yet to be issued, and the uncertainty about the
requirements is causing some builders to delay starts.

Residential investment expenditures have held up unusually well
relative to housing starts in recent years (chart). Expenditures are down
only 13 percent from their peak in 1986, although starts have fallen more
than 40 percent. During past downturns, home improvements fell less rapidly
than other residential expenditures or did not fall at all, cushioning
cyclical downturns in new construction (middle panel). Since starts began
trending down in 1986, home improvements have contributed to the relative
stability in total residential expenditures, but expenditures have declined
less rapidly than housing starts largely because the falloff in starts has
been concentrated in multifamily units (bottom panel). Multifamily starts
involve less than half as much construction spending per unit as single-
family homes.
Business Fixed Investment
Outlays for both business equipment and structures posted gains in the
third quarter. Equipment purchases jumped 10 percent (annual rate), led by
surges in outlays for aircraft and motor vehicles, which likely reflected
transitory factors and may be partly reversed in the current quarter. 5
The declines in cash flow in recent quarters (chart), along with the
slowdown in sales, underscore the weakness in underlying determinants of
business fixed investment. Given the tightening of credit availability, the
reduced volume of internally generated funds may be particularly important
for capital spending at this juncture.
5. Aircraft purchases rose because aircraft shipments were bunched in the
third quarter and a larger-than-usual share of these shipments went to
domestic--rather than foreign--airlines. The gain in motor vehicle
purchases reflects, in part, strong fleet sales.

The most recent orders and shipments data for nontransportation
equipment point to a continuation of this year's lackluster trend (chart).
These data remain on the essentially flat path that has persisted since the
end of last year. Shipments excluding aircraft and weighted to reflect only
final business purchases rose 2.5 percent in October but remained below the
levels reached earlier this year (table).
Computers have been a notable area of strength recently. Nominal
shipments of computers rose nearly 3-1/4 percent (monthly rate) in October
to a level 7-1/2 percent above the third-quarter average. However, the
surge may be short-lived: Orders for computers, after averaging through a
recent swing induced by IBM's announcement of a new line of mainframe
computers, have been relatively flat.
Real outlays for nonresidential structures, which advanced
2-1/2 percent at an annual rate for the third quarter as a whole, now appear
to have turned down. After falling sharply in August, nominal construction
put in place decreased about 1 percent in both September and October to a
level 2-3/4 percent below the third-quarter average. The October decline
was led by drops in office and other commercial construction.
Commitments for future building have continued the steep downward trend
that began at the end of last year (chart). Permits for office construction
dropped further, pushed down by high vacancy rates, falling rents, and tight
lending standards. Contracts for other commercial construction also have
trended down recently; anecdotal reports suggest that financing constraints
have tightened in this sector, particularly for strip shopping centers.
Although industrial building continued to post gains through the third
quarter, the recent decrease in new commitments for industrial construction

as well as the decline in capacity utilization rates suggests future
weakness.
Business Inventories
Businesses remain cautious in the management of inventories. In all
manufacturing and trade, stocks rose at an annual rate of $4.1 billion (1982
prices) in the third quarter, not much different from the moderate second-
quarter pace of $6.2 billion. By major sector, the inventory-sales ratio in
manufacturing continued to edge down and in retail and wholesale trade
remained within a relatively narrow band (chart).
Within manufacturing, the Persian Gulf crisis has directly influenced
inventories in the petroleum refining industry, and production adjustments
in most industries outside of petroleum refining are being accompanied by
reduced inventory investment. From August through October, inventories held
by oil refineries were drawn down substantially.
The change in inventories in manufacturing outside of petroleum
refining was only $2 billion (annual rate) in current-cost terms in October,
following an average accumulation of $4-1/2 billion over the first nine
months of this year. As a result of the conservative inventory stance, the
inventory-to-shipments ratio for all manufacturing has trended down since
the beginning of this year (chart, upper panel). Moreover, stage-of-
processing data have shown little net buildup of materials stocks since

July, suggesting that production in manufacturing will remain restrained in
coming months. 6
In the wholesale trade sector, inventories rose at an annual rate of
$2.3 billion in constant-dollar terms over the third quarter--only slightly
above the second-quarter pace. In October, wholesale inventories excluding
petroleum rose at just a $2.3 billion annual rate in current dollars, about
the same as in September and less than half of the average pace in the
preceding six months. Wholesale stocks of machinery and capital equipment--
which accounted for a sizable part of the accumulation in wholesale
inventories through the third quarter--were reduced at a $5-1/2 billion
annual rate in October.
In retail trade, non-auto establishments were able to trim their stocks
in August and September despite weak sales. In particular, at stores that
carry nondurable goods other than food (largely apparel and general
merchandise), inventories were reduced at an annual rate of $6 billion in
August and September. Indeed, stocks held by stores in this category showed
a net decline over the first nine months of this year--in line with the
anecdotal information that general merchandisers and apparel stores have
been extremely cautious in placing their orders this year, in an attempt to
keep their inventories at acceptable levels.
6. In constant-dollar terms, manufacturers' materials and supplies
inventories declined at a $4.2 billion annual rate during the third quarter
of this year. Although, in current-cost terms, Census data showed a
$7.7 billion accumulation of materials stocks in October, more than
one-third of the increase was in petroleum and petrochemical industries and
probably reflects higher prices.

programs evolve according to laws in effect at the time the projections are
made, and that appropriations for other programs are consistent with the new
discretionary spending caps. The projections include Social Security and
the Postal Service, which are off-budget.

II-29
Federal Government Sector
In October the federal government recorded a $31 billion budget
deficit, about the same as a year earlier after accounting for last year's
$6 billion shift in payments from October to September. Receipts totaled
$78.7 billion in October, including $1.6 billion for the Defense Cooperation
Account in which foreign contributions to Operation Desert Shield are
8
recorded. Excluding these contributions, receipts were about the same as
the average for the third quarter, allowing for the payments of estimated
personal and corporate income taxes that were due in September.
Outlays totaled $110 billion in October, boosted, in part, by higher
expenditures for deposit insurance. Net deposit insurance outlays were
$7 billion, including $6 billion in net outlays by the RTC and about
9$1 billion by the FDIC. RTC outlays have surged in the first month of
recent quarters, owing to the completion of end-of-quarter deals that flow
over into the following month.
Hard, up-to-date information on the cost of Operation Desert Shield
still is limited. Press reports vary, and the Pentagon does not give troop
strengths, but it appears that force levels will grow from more than 200,000
to more than 400,000 by mid-January. The Pentagon has not yet released a
revised estimate for Desert Shield outlays, but the Congressional Budget
7. When the first of the month falls on a weekend, as it did in October
1989, about $3-1/2 billion in military pay, $1 billion in supplemental
security income payments, and $1-1/2 billion in veteran's benefits payments
are shifted into the preceding month.
8. In November, the Defense Cooperation Account received $2.3 billion of
contributions.
9. In deriving net outlays of the RTC from gross outlays, $5 billion of
receipts from REFCORP were subtracted. The net outlays of the FDIC include
transactions in both the Bank Insurance Fund and the FSLIC Resolution Fund.

II-30
Office's estimates now show budget authority of $12 billion and outlays of
$9 billion.10
The CBO has released an interim assessment of the outlook for the
federal budget that takes into account the recent laws enacted by Congress,
including the new budget rules included in the reconciliation bill. The new
estimates also incorporate an informal--and rather dated--economic forecast
prepared by the CBO in October (table). The CBO now projects a $253 billion
budget deficit in FY1991, excluding Operation Desert Shield, and an FY1992
deficit of $262 billion, assuming that Congress abides by the new
discretionary spending caps. Excluding deposit insurance, the deficit is
projected at $162 billion in FY1991 and $155 billion in FY1992. The CBO
estimates that the new budget agreement reduces the deficit (relative to
CBO's July baseline) by $35 billion in FY1991 and $496 billion over five
years.
On an NIPA basis, real federal government purchases of goods and
services (excluding CCC) fell at a 2 percent annual rate in the third
quarter. Real defense purchases were unchanged in the third quarter, held
down by sales of defense inventories to Saudi Arabia. 11 To date, Operation
Desert Shield has had little net effect on real federal purchases, as the
10. The CBO estimate assumes no hostilities and full deployment for the
rest of the fiscal year. In September, under the smaller force level
assumption the Pentagon estimated $15 billion in budget authority and
$11-1/2 billion in outlays. This included $2 billion (of both budget
authority and outlays) for the effects on its normal fuel expenditures of a
$10 per barrel increase in the price of oil. Press reports indicate that
the $15 billion figure may be increased by $10 billion to reflect the
further buildup in the Gulf.
11. These sales did not affect real GNP in the third quarter because they
came out of inventories rather than current production. In the national
income and product accounts, the offsetting entry was an increase in
exports.

II-31
increased spending for this operation has been accompanied by reductions in
defense spending in less critical areas. Real nondefense purchases
(excluding CCC) fell at an 8 percent annual rate in the third quarter,
reflecting the termination of temporary Census workers.
State and Local Government Sector
Lower-than-expected revenues appear to be restraining the spending of
state and local governments, especially in states along the East Coast. A
recent informal survey taken by the National Conference of State
Legislatures indicates that so far in FY1991 revenues have been coming in
below expectations in twelve of the twenty-one states for which data are
available. Among major programs, states dealing with fiscal constraints are
likely to reduce spending on education, grants to local governments, and
medicaid. However, because much of medicaid is mandated by the federal
government, only those states offering optional services will be able to cut
medicaid outlays.
The October surge in state and local construction spending--to a level
nearly 6 percent (not at an annual rate) above its third-quarter average--
likely reflects noise in the data, rather than a higher underlying path for
these outlays. Indeed, spending is expected to slow as governments respond
to budgetary shortfalls. The results of November bond referenda seem to
indicate that taxpayers prefer spending restraint. The percentage of bonds
approved--at 40 percent of the total on state and local ballots--was the
lowest for any general election since 1975, a clear signal of taxpayer
reluctance to fund new projects. Even in California, where general
obligation issues typically fare relatively well, only 24 percent were

approved; among those rejected were bonds for higher education facilities
and water projects.
Prices
Higher crude oil prices continued to boost inflation in October, both
directly through their influence on the prices of refined petroleum products
and indirectly as a number of energy-intensive industries raised prices.
The CPI rose 0.6 percent in October, and the PPI for finished goods was up
1.1 percent further, somewhat less than in the previous two months.
Retail energy prices rose 4-1/2 percent in October, as prices of
gasoline and fuel oil climbed 7-3/4 and nearly 13 percent, respectively.
Gasoline prices were 27 percent--and fuel oil 51 percent--above their July
levels. Private survey data suggest that retail gasoline prices rose a bit
further in November, about completing the passthrough of the surge in crude
oil prices into the prices of refined petroleum products.
Spot and posted prices of crude oil have continued to fluctuate widely,
as political developments have altered the market's perception of the risk
of war. Posted prices of West Texas Intermediate crude averaged $31.32 per
barrel--and spot prices $32.30--in November, both about $3.50 below their
average levels in October (chart). Spot prices have dropped sharply since
late November, to $26.40 per barrel as of December 11; however, survey data
suggest that retail gasoline prices held up through early December (on a
seasonally adjusted basis), as the federal excise tax was increased by
5 cents per gallon.
The CPI for food rose 0.4 percent in October. Meat prices were up
markedly, reflecting higher livestock prices, but prices of fruits and
vegetables edged down. More recently, hog prices have declined in spot

markets, while steer prices have remained high. Wholesale prices of some
fresh vegetables also spurted temporarily in November. As of October, the
year-over-year increase in the CPI for food continued at about
5-1/2 percent. Nevertheless, both current supply conditions and futures
prices for agricultural commodities point to a slowing of retail food price
increases in the coming year.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI advanced 0.3 percent in
October, the same as in September. Prices of nonfood, nonenergy commodities
rose only 0.2 percent as apparel prices declined, reversing part of the
large increase recorded in September. However, the index for new cars was
up 0.5 percent, reflecting higher prices for the 1991 models included in the
sample.
The CPI for nonenergy services rose 0.3 percent for the second month
after three months of increases of 0.6 to 0.8 percent. In large part this
recent monthly pattern reflects the index for owners' equivalent rent, which
12rose sharply from May to August but then about leveled off. Over the
twelve months ending in October, owners' equivalent rent has registered an
increase of 5-1/2 percent, about 1/2 percentage point less than its annual
pace during the summer. Nevertheless, in October the CPI for services less
energy remained 6-1/4 percent above its level of a year earlier, owing to
sharply higher prices for a variety of services, including medical care,
airfares, cable television, and automobile fees.
12. To compute owners' equivalent rent, the BLS adjusts contract rents--the
amount tenants actually agree to pay landlords--to exclude the value of
utilities provided by landlords. CPI indexes for utility charges, rather
than the actual utility charges to tenants from landlords, are used in the
adjustment; this procedure (together with the relative fixity of rents on a
monthly basis) might explain part of the recent deceleration in the index
for owners' equivalent rent.

Higher energy prices are beginning to spill over into the prices of
other goods and services (table). The effect is most visible at the
intermediate goods level where the prices of a variety of petrochemicals and
derivatives have risen sharply over the past three months. Among producer
prices of finished goods and consumer prices, some pickup is evident for
cosmetics and tires. However, the spillover to date at the consumer level
has been mainly in the prices of transportation services.
Spot prices for industrial metals have continued to weaken since early
November, though not as rapidly as in the preceding weeks. The Journal of
Commerce sub-index for metals has fallen about 2-1/4 percent since the
November FOMC meeting, and the CRB spot index for industrials has declined
1/4 percent.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Signs of a weakening economy, hopes of avoiding a disruption of oil
supplies, and an easing of monetary policy have caused market interest rates
to fall since the November FOMC meeting. The federal funds rate has dropped
to 7-1/4 percent, for a decline of roughly 1/2 percentage point since mid-
November, and most other market interest rates are down 20 to 45 basis
points.
For a time late last month, concerns about potential year-end pressures
and bank funding needs intensified dramatically, pushing yields on bank-
related securities sharply higher relative to those on Treasury obligations.
Partly in reaction to the Board's decision to reduce reserve requirements,
however, these spreads narrowed, and bank stock prices rose. This action
apparently was interpreted by market participants as possibly signalling a
more accommodative monetary policy stance, the Federal Reserve's willingness
to take steps to prevent a funding crunch at year-end, and the Federal
Reserve's sensitivity to stresses in the banking sector.
Although quality spreads in bank funding markets are now below the
levels of the previous FOMC meeting, many remain higher than a few months
ago (chart). Further deterioration in the credit quality of bank loan
portfolios, along with capital considerations, has induced banks to widen
interest rate margins on some loans; in addition, the prime rate has
remained unchanged despite further easing of the federal funds rate. In the
commercial paper market, risk premiums have increased, on balance, since
mid-November. A2/P2 issuers have faced strong investor resistance, causing

quality spreads to widen (chart) and inducing some issuers to tap their
backup lines of credit at banks.
Drawdowns of these lines may be one factor behind the turnaround in C&I
loans last month, at a time when nonfinancial commercial paper was
declining. The fall-off in commercial paper also may reflect some
substitution with public bond issuance, which has picked up substantially in
response to the drop in long-term rates. Overall, business credit demand
appears to have firmed of late, while for households available data suggest
that mortgage borrowing has remained subdued and consumer credit has
weakened further.
M2 edged down in November, despite a further reduction in opportunity
costs of holding monetary assets. The continued weak expansion in bank
credit, along with the ongoing retrenchment in the thrift industry,
contributed to a second straight monthly decline in M3.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
After falling in October, M1 grew at a 4 percent rate in November,
reflecting a bounceback in transactions accounts. Currency growth, which
had been running at a 12-1/2 percent rate through October, came in at about
one-third the rate in November. In previous months, shipments abroad had
fueled much of the rapid expansion in currency.
M2 edged down last month after barely increasing in October. Nearly
all of its nontransactions components were weak. Money market mutual funds,
which had grown rapidly in the three preceding months, fell in November,
perhaps reflecting the rebound in stock prices. Monthly flows into M2 money

1990, suggesting that individual investors tend to tilt the composition of
their portfolios away from safer assets during a market upturn (chart).
More important, however, slow M2 growth in the fourth quarter reflects
a weak underlying trend in nontransactions deposits--savings, small time,
and money market deposit accounts--which make up almost two-thirds of this
aggregate. These deposits decelerated in September from an already sluggish
August pace and have declined in the two most recent months. At commercial
banks, which previously benefited from the exodus from thrifts,
nontransactions deposits grew at only a 2-1/4 percent rate in November--the
slowest pace in nearly two years.
Even after allowing for weak income growth, the deceleration in retail
deposit growth since August is puzzling because opportunity costs have been
declining since earlier in the year. Money demand models suggest that the
decline in opportunity costs should have raised nontransactions deposit
growth more than a percentage point in the third quarter and by a comparable
amount in the fourth quarter. Instead, deposit growth has slowed, perhaps
reflecting a shift in asset preferences toward other instruments, as
suggested by the strong pace of noncompetitive tenders for Treasury
securities and by a pickup in inflows to stock and bond funds.
In November, M3 declined at a 1 percent rate for a second consecutive
month. Large time deposits continued to fall, owing to weak credit demand
and the desire of many depositories to shrink their balance sheets ahead of
year-end statement dates.
Consistent with this pattern of M3 growth, thrift credit likely
contracted at a good clip last month, while bank credit remained anemic.
Although business loan growth at banks turned positive, other major

components were weak. As part of their downsizing efforts, banks ran off
securities and securitized large amounts of consumer and home equity loans
in November.
Reflecting the cautious attitudes of borrowers and lenders, real estate
loans grew at a 5 percent rate in November, down from 8 percent in October.
Although about $1 billion of home equity loans and other second mortgages
were securitized in November, this occurred late in the month and
consequently had little effect on the overall growth rate of real estate
loans. Excluding home equity lines, real estate lending was even weaker at
about 2 percent.
Consumer loans fell at a 3 percent annual rate in November, marking
their second straight monthly decline. Adjusted for securitizations,
consumer loans grew at only a 2 percent rate, down sharply from the rates
prevailing throughout much of the year. Survey results suggest that this
deceleration may reflect an increased reluctance on the part of consumers to
take on new debt, as income growth becomes both slower and more uncertain,
rather than a recent tightening in lending standards. Surveys of bank loan
officers taken during 1990 indicate that the change in banks' willingness to
make consumer installment loans has only turned from slightly positive, on
balance, a year ago to about unchanged recently.
Business loans rose at a 5-3/4 percent annual rate last month after
declining in both September and October. The November gains partly reflect
a drop in commercial paper outstanding of nonfinancial businesses, as some
medium- and lower-rated firms turned to bank backup lines to avoid higher
costs of issuing paper relative to borrowing from banks. In addition, some
issuers reportedly tapped their backup lines to test their availability.

All of the increase in business loans occurred at foreign-related
institutions, principally Japanese branches and agencies, where loan
commitments had grown rapidly in the past few years.
Adding to pressures on bank capital positions and a reluctance to lend
have been growing asset quality problems. Preliminary data from the third
quarter Call Reports show that loan chargeoffs and delinquencies continued
to mount, especially for real estate and consumer loans (chart). The
deterioration in the performance of real estate loans was concentrated in
the east coast districts.
Nonfinancial Business Finance
Total borrowing by nonfinancial corporations appears to have firmed a
bit in November. After growing in previous months, the sum of commercial
paper and C&I loans was flat last month. Gross public bond issuance was up
significantly in November and has been robust thus far in December, as
corporations have taken advantage of the decline in interest rates. Some of
the funds have been used to pay down commercial paper or to refund
outstanding long-term debt. The pickup was concentrated in investment-grade
issues, while junk issuance has been nil. Business credit at finance
companies rose about 10 percent at an annual rate in October, down
significantly from September's pace. Virtually all October's slowdown
reflected a large decline in the growth of wholesale auto financing, which
had previously been growing rapidly.
Participants in the commercial paper market have feared that normal
year-end pressures will be exacerbated by increased bank reluctance to lend
and by money funds' efforts to reduce holdings of medium-grade paper. The
anticipation of these pressures was especially evident during the last week

of November when Japanese banks moved aggressively to lock in funding over
the statement date, causing the forward rate on turn-of-the-year federal
funds to soar to 25 percent or more. These pressures subsided somewhat with
the lowering of reserve requirements, but rates on such funding still have
been around 14 percent in recent days. In the commercial paper market, the
rate on 30-day, top-rated paper rose about 1/2 percentage point as the
maturity date moved into the new year. In addition, some A2/P2 issuers of
commercial paper are paying as much as 90 basis points more than A1/P1
firms to fund into early January, in contrast to a spread of 55 basis points
for paper maturing in the last week of December. Tiering has occurred even
in the top-rated A1/P1 category, as investors have become less willing to
purchase bank-related, asset-backed issues and paper relying on bank letters
of credit.
The availability of credit to small businesses, as indicated by the
National Federation of Independent Business' monthly survey, was little
changed in November, although credit conditions remain tighter than those
prevailing earlier in the year. In the private placement market, life
insurance companies apparently have been shifting bond purchases toward
investment-grade issues and away from private placements by small and
medium-sized borrowers. This shift has been reinforced by the new rating
categories established by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, which become effective at year-end and may result in a
substantial portion of insurers' current bond holdings being reclassified
from investment grade to speculative grade. Market reports also suggest a
movement by pension funds away from corporate bonds toward government
securities. On the other hand, some large finance companies are reportedly

looking to increase their lending to those firms that might face trouble
placing their debt with other lenders.
According to preliminary NIPA data, before-tax economic profits from
domestic operations of the nonfinancial corporate sector are estimated to
have fallen $21.5 billion in the third quarter or 36.5 percent at an annual
rate, extending the slump begun in early 1989. Declines apparently were
registered throughout the nonfinancial sector. As a share of gross domestic
nonfinancial corporate product, before-tax economic profits declined from 8
to 7.2 percent, largely owing to increases in the share to labor and to
indirect taxes. Taxes rose, as book profits were boosted by inventory
gains, and dividends increased. As a consequence, undistributed profits--
after IVA and CCA--turned negative last quarter and cash flow fell more than
$25 billion.
In equity markets, major stock indexes have risen 2 to 4-1/4 percent
over the intermeeting period, buoyed by lower interest rates and improved
prospects for a peaceful resolution in the Middle East. Nevertheless,
offerings of new shares by nonfinancial firms remained scarce in November
and initial public offerings all but dried up. Completions of mergers and
acquisitions continue to be light, with small and middle-level deals
constituting the bulk of the activity. With the MCA and NCR acquisitions
not likely to be completed until next year, net equity retirements in the
fourth quarter are estimated to be lower than their third-quarter pace.
Financial Firms
The Dow Jones index of financial stock prices was up about 4-3/4
percent over the intermeeting period. After matching the overall stock
market's advance in the last half of November, bank stock prices soared

following the reduction in reserve requirements--and by more than estimates
of the direct impact of lowering requirements on profits would imply--
suggesting the policy change was seen as a sign of a more favorable attitude
on the part of federal regulators. Prices of insurance companies, which had
been battered of late, also improved. Equitable Life's announcement on
December 11 to convert from a mutual to a stock company, along with the
downgrading of its claims paying ability, reportedly had little immediate
effect on stock and bond prices of publicly traded stock insurance
companies. In contrast to the upward movement in stock prices of most
financial firms, thrift stock prices fell nearly 5 percent over the
intermeeting period.
Several major bank holding companies chose to redeem portions of their
outstanding auction-rate preferred stock rather than pay sharply higher
rates. Dividends on some of these issues were recently reset at rates
exceeding 100 percent of the benchmark commercial paper index, and market
participants reportedly expected rates to move still higher at year-end.
Asset-backed issuance continued at a healthy pace in November, as banks
attempted to improve their capital ratios. After widening significantly in
October, spreads on asset-backed securities have since increased another 10
basis points. Spreads on the unsecured debt of finance companies have
followed a similar pattern.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
Seasonal influences are expected to increase the deficit to about $96
billion in the fourth quarter from $58 billion last quarter. The Treasury
is expected, as usual, to finance the bulk of the deficit by borrowing.
Gross sizes of bill and coupon auctions have been increased progressively

over the past year to finance the widening federal deficit. Coupon issues
have provided $30 billion to $40 billion in new cash each quarter, while net
bill issuance has been more variable to meet seasonal and other special
funding needs.
In the market for government sponsored enterprise debt, changes in
spreads on securities have been mixed and erratic since the last FOMC
meeting. Overall borrowing by the federal agencies appears to have picked
up in October. The outstanding debt of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs)
showed a small increase in October, breaking with a trend of sixteen
successive monthly declines. The FHLBs' borrowing has been concentrated in
short-term securities, reflecting the shortening of maturities on advances
to member institutions caused partly by the tendency of new commercial bank
and credit union members to borrow for very short periods. An additional
factor that has shortened the maturity of advances is the thrift industry's
greater use of so-called pipeline funding, whereby mortgages need to be
funded for only 90 days or so until they can be sold into the secondary
market. The Resolution Trust Corporation's practice of repaying advances
with little or no notice also has pushed the FHLBs toward shorter-term debt.
Municipal Securities
Issuance of long-term state and local government securities remained
sluggish in November, running at an estimated $8.7 billion pace. Refunding
issuance slowed to a trickle, because few eligible outstanding issues are
attractive for refunding at current yields. Reflecting the paucity of

Budget problems in the Northeast have continued to worsen. New York
City announced revisions to its 1991 fiscal plan, including budget cuts and
a hiring freeze. The rating agencies criticized the revised plan, however,
suggesting that the savings would only cover half of the $600 million
prospective 1991 deficit, with the remainder being pushed into fiscal year
1992. Despite having imposed large budget cuts and tax increases last
fiscal year, New Jersey faces a $600 million projected deficit in the
current fiscal year stemming from a decline in tax revenues. The projected
1991 budget deficit for Connecticut is nearly as large as New Jersey's, and
its fiscal 1992 deficit is estimated to be $2.1 billion. The District of
Columbia faces a budget deficit of $200 million this year that could rise to
$700 million by 1996, according to a report by an independent commission.

III-18
Philadelphia's budget problems remain the most severe in the Northeast.
According to the city controller, funds in a special escrow account
established to ensure debt service on the city's revenue bonds will suffice
only through February, although from March onward, operating fees will be
sufficient to cover debt service in the current fiscal year. To avoid
failing to make scheduled debt service payments on both revenue and general
obligation debt, the city is negotiating with local banks, the state
treasurer, and the city pension fund for a $300 million loan, which also
would be used to cover normal operating expenses. If these negotiations
break down, the city finance director has promised to limit spending only to
debt service when the city's cash reserves fall to $52 million, which is
expected to occur in late December. As a result of these developments,
Moody's downgraded the city's revenue bonds, with airport bonds dropping to
speculative levels.
The municipal sector also has been affected by the downgrading of
commercial banks. In late November, Standard & Poor's dropped the credit
rating of $4.5 billion in municipal revenue bonds backed by Citicorp letters
of credit, and it placed another $2.3 billion of state housing agency debt
associated with Citicorp on CreditWatch. In addition, $14 billion of
municipal debt was downgraded when the ratings of four Japanese banks were
reduced by Moody's.
Mortgage.Markets
Rates in the residential mortgage market have declined in recent weeks,
to the lowest levels since the beginning of the year. Yields on both fixed-
and adjustable-rate mortgages generally have moved with yields on Treasury

III-19
securities of comparable maturity, and spreads remain about 20 to 30 basis
points above their late summer levels (chart).
Reports suggest that real estate loan quality continued to deteriorate
in the third quarter, especially in the Northeast. Preliminary data from
the Mortgage Bankers Association indicate that the average delinquency rate
on all mortgages past due for at least 60 days increased in the third
quarter to 1.53 percent from 1.39 percent in the second quarter. Problem
commercial loans were cited as major factors underlying the third quarter
losses reported by several large thrift institutions in the Northeast, while
charges to reserves for residential mortgage losses led to reduced earnings
or losses at other thrifts and commercial banks. At life insurance
companies, the delinquency rate on all mortgages increased slightly in the
third quarter to 3.35 percent, the highest level since March 1988; at 3.36
percent, the delinquency rate on their commercial real estate loans is at
the highest level in the past decade.
Problem loans have been rising at the government sponsored
institutions, as well. Freddie Mac, which suspended purchases of
multifamily loans in October to stem continued losses, reported a
significant increase in delinquencies among the single-family ARMs held
2either in its investment portfolio or as collateral for its securities.
Freddie Mac attributed the pickup in ARM delinquencies to weakening economic
conditions and normal seasoning effects, as loans acquired in 1986 and 1987
approach the peak period of delinquency. Fannie Mae reported that a

percent as of September 30, up from 0.95 percent in June and 0.84 percent a

percent in September, up slightly from 0.57 percent in June and 0.60 percent
a year earlier.

weakening regional economy and instances of declining property values led to
a doubling in its acquisitions of foreclosed property in the Northeast
during the first three quarters of 1990, although its foreclosures
nationwide were down about 20 percent from a year earlier.
Lenders' concerns about credit quality and regulatory scrutiny are
frequently mentioned in trade reports as contributing to the slowing in
overall mortgage lending in recent months. Real estate loan growth at banks
averaged less than a 7 percent annual rate in October and November, little
changed from the subdued third quarter pace, while SAIF-insured institutions
likely continued to reduce their asset holdings, judging from monthly
changes in liabilities at these institutions. The runoff of mortgage assets
at thrifts had occurred disproportionately in holdings of mortgage-backed
securities late last year and early this year. More recent information,
however, suggests that these institutions have been running off holdings of
whole mortgage loans, reflecting efforts by capital-deficient institutions
to meet the interim risk-based capital requirement that becomes effective at
year-end. The drop in multifamily and commercial mortgage loans on the
books of thrifts has been the largest factor (in dollar terms) underlying
the sluggish aggregate growth rates of these two types of loans in recent
quarters. Despite their own pullback, commercial banks and life insurance
companies have accounted for the bulk of the net increase in these mortgage
debt categories in recent quarters.
In home loan markets, the proportion of loans being securitized has
continued to expand, as reflected in the secondary market activities of
Fannie and Freddie. Despite generally weak mortgage lending, issuance of
federally related pass-through securities has been running well ahead of

last year's pace, and issuance of multiclass securities by the agencies is
on a record-setting pace (table). Fannie and Freddie recently completed
arrangements to streamline their application process, making it easier for
credit unions to sell them mortgages. The RTC, meanwhile, has announced
plans to begin securitizing loans from its portfolio.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer credit growth in October weakened further. Installment credit
outstanding grew at a 2-1/2 percent annual rate--down from the 4-1/2 percent
increase in September. The gain in October was in revolving credit, which
advanced at a slower pace than in September, and in the "other" category,
which expanded at a slightly more rapid pace. Auto loans outstanding
declined in the month, as they have throughout most of the past year,
consistent with the reduced volume of auto purchases. Total consumer credit
(installment plus noninstallment) rose at about a 1 percent annual rate,
close to the September pace of 1-1/2 percent.
Over the six months ending in October, consumer borrowing for
automobiles declined at a 3 percent annual rate; to some extent this
reduction may be due to alternative financing, such as home equity loans or
leasing. At finance companies the drop in auto lending was an even sharper
9-1/2 percent. 3  In large measure, the steeper decline in consumer
borrowing at finance companies may reflect the continued reliance by
automakers on rebates, rather than reduced loan rates, as their major form
of incentive. Although there are some reports of banks tightening their
standards on auto loans, this type of credit appears to be generally

available at normal pricing at most banks, and so the captive auto finance
companies have not had to step up their lending.
Movements in consumer loan rates at commercial banks were mixed between
August and November. The most common rate on a 48-month new car loan
declined 17 basis points to 11.72 percent, while rates on credit cards and
24-month personal loans moved up.
Available measures of consumer loan quality suggest some deterioration,
on net, during the third quarter. The American Bankers Association (ABA)
series on delinquencies on all closed-end consumer loans edged down 6 basis
points in the third quarter--mainly on the strength of a large drop in
4delinquencies on personal loans. Delinquencies on credit cards inched up
8 basis points to 2.54 percent--about in the middle of their range over the
past 15 years. Call Report data for large commercial banks indicated a
continued upward movement in the overall consumer loan delinquency rate.
Personal bankruptcy filings increased slightly in the third quarter and
continue to run about 15 percent above the 1989 pace.
Recently, concerns have arisen that large defaults on credit cards
could trigger an early call on some credit card-backed securities, thus
exposing buyers of these securities to possible prepayment risk. 5 The
likelihood of such prepayments, however, appears quite remote because
defaults would have to rise very sharply to trigger an early call. Spreads

sample panel which may not be consistent over time--to find the number and

APPENDIX
GROWTH OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN 1990
After a reasonable first-quarter showing, growth of the broader
monetary aggregates weakened markedly over the balance of the year. M2 has
grown at barely a 2-1/4 percent annual rate since March, bringing its
increase from the fourth quarter of 1989 through November to 3-3/4 percent,
and leaving this aggregate in the lower quartile of its annual target range.
The growth of M2 so far this year is well below both what the staff had been
expecting earlier in the year and what money demand models suggest would be
implied by historical relationships with income and interest rates. The
slowdown in M3 growth from last year to a 1-1/4 rate this year is more
pronounced than that for M2, but it is more explicable: Pressures on bank
capital positions and last year's thrift legislation, which set in motion a
rapid contraction of the thrift industry, have cut into depository credit
expansion, and thus reduced these institutions' needs for funds--a reduction
that shows through in lower M3 growth. By contrast, Ml growth picked up
from near zero in 1989 to 4 percent this year.
The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors decelerated further in 1990
despite a pickup in its federal component associated with RTC resolutions.
At a 7 percent rate through October, growth in the debt aggregate appears
poised to come in at its lowest level in two decades.
M1
Despite the slower growth in nominal income, Ml grew somewhat faster
this year than last, responding in part to the effects of lower market
interest rates on incentives to hold transactions balances. In addition,
about half of the pickup in Ml growth for the year reflected stronger growth
of currency. Currency growth more than doubled from last year and, at 11
percent, was the most rapid of the postwar period. Perhaps a third of the
pickup in currency growth reflected a lagged response to the drop in market
interest rates from the peak in early 1989, but the bulk of the acceleration
appears attributable to increased demands for U.S. currency outside our
borders. Information on shipments overseas suggests that demands for U.S.
currency were particularly heavy in areas experiencing economic and
political turmoil, especially Eastern Europe, Latin America, and, after the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August, the Middle East. In November, currency
expanded at just a 5 percent rate, probably reflecting a dropoff of demands
from abroad.
Besides foreign demands for currency, several other special factors
influenced the growth of Ml at various times through the year, some of which
showed through to the broader aggregates. For example, restructuring of
accounts and new practices by individual large banks sometimes had
significant effects. OCDs dropped by about $2.5 billion at the beginning of
July after the subsidiary banks began to sweep
OCD accounts into a trust account, with the funds then returned to the banks
as a series of large time deposits. (At least one such CD matures daily to
fund checks drawn on the OCD accounts.) This action by a single entity

pared 1/4 percent off the annual growth of M1 and a negligible amount off
M2, while leaving M3 unaffected. A few weeks later, Security Pacific scaled
back its securities clearing operation in order to boost its capital-asset
ratio. This action increased demand deposits, and the monetary aggregates,
by about $3 billion because Security Pacific's accounting for certain
securities clearing activities had been reducing its reported demand
deposits.
Overall, despite the boost from Security Pacific, demand deposits
contracted again this year. For several years, demand deposits have
exhibited a weak underlying trend, probably reflecting the movement by firms
away from compensating balance arrangements and toward fee-based payments
for bank services. This has left more firms holding their marginal balances
for pure transactions needs, so that innovations that allow firms to
economize on their cash balances are showing through to overall demand
deposits. Moreover, transactions balances would be much less sensitive to
changes in interest rates than compensating balances, in part explaining why
the drop in interest rates since early 1989 has had less effect on demand
balances than would be implied by historical relationships.
OCDs increased 3-1/4 percent through November--higher than the 1989
growth rate. Nevertheless, the pace of OCD growth this year reflected the
restraining influence of slow income growth and still-wide opportunity
costs. One puzzle about the behavior of this component, however, was the
slow growth evident late in the year--even accounting for the dropoff in
nominal income growth--at a time when opportunity costs had narrowed
appreciably.
M2
M2 expanded along the 7 percent upper bound of its target cone in the
first quarter, but slowed notably thereafter. Currently, there is no fully
satisfactory explanation for the anemic pace of recent quarters. While the
weaker income growth this year is, no doubt, one of the factors pulling M2
growth down to its lowest level in several decades, money demand models
indicate that something else must be at work as well. One force possibly
involved in the slowdown could be the shifting of intermediation flows
associated with the contraction of the thrift industry and the increased
reluctance of commercial banks to expand their balance sheets. These
trends, which have their primary effect on the M3 aggregate, also may have
damped M2 by lessening commercial banks' and thrifts' need to bid for retail
funds. As a result, opportunity costs were somewhat higher than might have
been expected from the pattern of market rates for part of the year.
However, money demand models using actual opportunity costs badly
overpredict M2 growth since the first quarter, with the largest error in the
current quarter, when the recent decline in opportunity costs has failed to
revive M2 growth. Some of the changes in effective opportunity costs may
not be well measured by the indexes used in the models; for example,
advertising may have been cut back, and the RTC has allowed high-rate
contracts to be abrogated as deposits at failed thrifts were assumed by
banks and other thrifts. The slump of M2 growth--and shortfall relative to
traditional demand models--began around the time that RTC activity picked

III-A-4
up, suggesting some disturbance related to the shift of deposits and the
overall decline in depository institution funding needs.
Nevertheless, even taking account of possible misspecification of
opportunity costs, M2 growth remains much slower than seems explainable,
indicating a downward shift in demand as well. To some extent damped M2 may
have reflected weak saving, as households sought to maintain spending in the
face of higher prices for energy products and the softening of real income
growth. The slack pace of consumer credit--even relative to spending--
suggests households may have turned in favor of drawing down liquid assets
rather than accumulating debt to support spending. But the strength of
noncompetitive tenders at Treasury auctions--a rough index of retail demand
for Treasury securities--may indicate some decline in demand for depository
obligations in particular. Perhaps the publicity about the demise of the
S&L industry and about credit quality problems at banks have caused some
investors to shy away from deposits.
M3
M3 growth through November was only 1-1/4 percent, slightly above the
lower edge of its target range. That range itself had been lowered in
midyear by 1-1/2 percentage points amid evidence that the drop in thrift
assets was proceeding more rapidly than had been expected and that credit
flows were being redirected away from depository institutions. On top of
the shrinkage in thrift assets--as marginal institutions retrenched and the
RTC transferred large amounts of assets onto its own books in the course of
closing failed institutions--commercial banks became less willing to expand
their balance sheets. With asset quality problems mounting, new capital
standards phasing in at year-end, and capital markets giving a poor
reception to bank offerings, commercial banks generally increased their
efforts to securitize loans, raised price and nonprice costs of credit, and
tightened lending standards. As a result, banks' needs for funds were
limited.
In dollar terms, the entire increase in M3 so far this year can be more
than accounted for by growth in currency and money fund obligations; overall
depository liabilities in M3 registered a small decline. M2 inflows into
depositories were more than sufficient to fund their credit growth. As a
result, they ran off managed liabilities rapidly, including large time
deposits, which fell nearly 10 percent.
Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt
Through October, the debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors grew at
a 7 percent annual rate, marking a fourth straight year of deceleration.
This pace still exceeded the growth of nominal GNP, but only because of the
strong increase in U.S. government debt that largely reflected financial
intermediation associated with RTC resolution activity. RTC's net outlays
contributed about 2-1/4 percentage points to the growth of federal sector
debt and about 1/2 percentage point to the growth of total domestic
nonfinancial debt.
Nonfederal debt growth slowed to about a 5-3/4 percent rate, and data
suggest that, for the year, all major components will grow more slowly than

III-A-5
in any year since 1983. Consumer credit was sluggish, especially auto
loans; home mortgage borrowing also ebbed over the course of the year as
real estate markets deteriorated and housing activity slumped. State and
local governments cut back on the amount of new borrowing they undertook,
and there evidently were sizable retirements of debt that had been advance-
refunded earlier. Also, late in the year, certain municipalities were
losing access to the credit markets amid financial distress.
Business borrowing slackened further in 1990 as needs to finance
corporate restructuring diminished. Even so, the corporate financing gap
increased in the second half of the year in the face of declining profits.
A tightening of credit availability for all but the top-rated firms became
increasingly evident as the year progressed: Banks reported raising lending
standards at the same time that downgradings increased and the new issuance
market for junk bonds evaporated.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
Preliminary data for September indicate that the deficit in U.S.
merchandise trade was little changed at $9.4 billion (seasonally adjusted,
Census basis) from an upward revised deficit in August of $9.7 billion. The
small reduction of the deficit in September reflected a sharp decline in
non-oil imports that was nearly offset by an increase in the value of oil
imports and an easing in exports. For the third quarter, the deficit
increased to a level unmatched since the third quarter of last year.

Several elements contributed to the large deficit in recent months.
The value of oil imports rose nearly 30 percent in September following an
equally large increase in August; for the third quarter oil imports were 30
percent higher than in the second quarter with nearly all of the increase
attributable to higher prices. Between July and September the average price
of imported oil rose $10 per barrel to just under $25 per barrel. The rise
in import prices lagged the sharp increases in posted and spot prices,

following the same pattern as in previous oil market disruptions. Allowing
for shipping lags, posted and spot prices suggest that the price of imported
oil will have approached $30 per barrel in October. The quantity of oil

imported increased about 3 percent in the third quarter, reflecting small
recorded increases in both oil consumption and inventories (with the former
including secondary and tertiary inventories as well). Recent weekly data
on oil imports reported by the Department of Energy indicate a sharp drop in
imports in both October and November, likely the result of a slowdown in
refinery runs to undertake necessary maintenance.
For the third quarter non-oil imports were 2 percent higher than in
the second quarter (see the table below), despite a sharp drop in September.
Much of the third quarter increase was in quantity, largely in consumer

goods and automotive products, with smaller increases recorded for
industrial supplies and computers; the growth in non-oil imports was roughly
in line with the increase in domestic demand. Part of the higher value of
non-oil imports was from an increase in prices that was associated, in part,
with the recent decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Most
of the increase in non-oil imports in the third quarter came from countries
in Asia (the NIEs, China, other developing countries, and Japan).
The value of nonagricultural exports in the third quarter was about
the same as in the second quarter. Increased exports to Latin America and
Japan were offset by declines in shipments to Canada and Western Europe.
The quantity of nonagricultural exports increased slightly in the third
quarter led by expanding exports of consumer goods and computers; exports of
automotive products and aircraft declined. Nonetheless, the quantity of
nonagricultural exports in the third quarter was 8-1/2 percent higher than a
year earlier. Agricultural exports declined for the second quarter in a row
in both quantity and value; most of the decrease was in corn and soybeans.
Prices of Imports and Exports
Prices of imported oil jumped again in October, more than doubling
since July, according to data released by the BLS. Prices of non-oil
imports rose 0.4 percent in October, following a stronger increase in
September; the rise in October was led by higher prices for passenger cars.
(See the table below.) For the third quarter, prices of non-oil imports
rose 5.4 percent (annual rate) over the second quarter, the largest
quarterly increase in two years. The rise was spread among most major trade
categories, reflecting the effects of the depreciation of the dollar.

Export prices rose slightly in October following a 3.6 percent (annual
rate) increase in the third quarter. For the third quarter, gains in prices
of exported industrial supplies (especially fuel and petroleum-based
chemicals) were partly offset by a drop in prices for agricultural exports.
U.S. Current Account in 1990-03
The U.S. current account deficit was $102.3 billion (seasonally
adjusted annual rate) in the third quarter, $12.4 billion larger than in the
revised second quarter (see table below). An increase in the merchandise

investment income reflected an increase in receipts from foreign petroleum

affiliates. The decline in net service transactions was accounted for by a
boost to direct defense expenditures resulting from the stationing of U.S.
troops in the Middle East that was larger than an increase in deliveries to
the Middle East under military agency sales contracts.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Net recorded capital inflows reached $26 billion in the third quarter,
an amount roughly equal to the recorded current account deficit. Large
inflows through private bank transactions and increased holdings in the
United States by official foreigners were offset by a sharp increase in U.S.
direct investment abroad. Private securities transactions registered small
net outflows in the quarter. In October official holdings in the United
States continued to rise. Bank transactions switched to net outflows in the
month and outflows through private security transactions continued.
Recorded capital inflows through the banking system totaled more than
$26 billion in the third quarter (line 1 of the Summary Table). About two
thirds of the inflow reflected increased liabilities to related foreign
offices; foreign-based banks in general, and Japanese-based banks in
particular, accounted for a large share of the inflow. The inflow from
abroad tended to offset weak growth in demand deposits and a decline in
large time deposits at all banks. Data for October, measured on a month-end
basis, show an outflow of about $6 billion. However, data reported to the
Federal Reserve on banks' net claims on their own foreign offices and IBFs
indicate a continued reliance on related foreign offices as a source of
funds in during October and November on a monthly average basis (see line 1
of the International Banking Table).
In addition to the interbank inflows, loans to U.S. nonbanks booked
offshore also increased during the third quarter. On a month-end basis
foreign banks increased their loans to U.S. nonbanks by over $4 billion and

the offshore offices of U.S.-based banks increased their loans to U.S.
nonbanks by almost $2 billion. As shown in line 2 of the Banking table, on
a monthly average basis loans from foreign offices of U.S.-based banks
increased further in October and November.
In contrast to the banking flows, private security transactions
registered outflows of $3 billion in the quarter (line 2 of the Summary
Table). Foreigners on net sold U.S. corporate and agency bonds in August
and September (line 2.a). Foreigners also sold U.S. stocks in August and
September as share prices were generally declining (line 2b). U.S.
residents purchased net $1.8 billion of foreign securities in the quarter.
Foreign transactions in Treasury obligations (line 3) mirrored the
activity in corporate and agency bonds; large net purchases in July were
mostly offset by sales that began in August and accelerated in September
(line 3).
In October foreign transactions in both Treasury bonds and corporate
and agency bonds swung to net purchases. However, foreign net sales of
stocks accelerated in the month to $3.5 billion.
Foreign official holdings in the United States increased further in
September, bringing the increase during the third quarter to $14.3 billion
(line 4). Two thirds of the increase was attributable to G-10 countries,
In October foreign official holdings in the United States increased $3.9
billion further. Partial data from FRB New York indicate official holdings
in the U.S. increased $4 billion in November.
U.S. direct investment abroad increased by more than $19 billion in
the third quarter (line 6). This large outflow reflected the financing of
several takeovers, including the purchase of Jacobs Suchard by Philip Morris
and the purchase of the New Zealand Telephone Company by the Bell Atlantic

IV-11
Corporation. In addition to the takeovers, plant and equipment expenditure
by the foreign affiliates of U.S. corporations have remained strong. By
contrast, foreign direct investment in the United States was $7.6 billion in
the third quarter, only slightly above its second quarter level and far
below its 1989 pace.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign-exchange value of the dollar in terms of
the other G-10 currencies differs little from its level at the November 13
FOMC meeting, as shown in the accompanying chart. The dollar fluctuated
during the period as perceptions changed regarding Middle East tensions.
Around the time of the U.N. Security Council's vote authorizing the use of
force against Iraq, the dollar rose sharply, but it retreated somewhat when
Saddam Hussein announced that he intended to allow foreigners held in Iraq
and Kuwait to leave. The dollar retreated further when the weaker-than-
expected U.S. employment figures for November were released and the federal
funds rate declined. The dollar changed little, overall, against the mark
over the intermeeting period, while it appreciated about 1-3/4 percent
against the yen.
German short-term interest rates increased about 30 basis points from
their levels at the time of the last FOMC meeting. Indications of continued
strong economic growth in Western Germany heightened perceptions that the
Bundesbank was adopting a tighter monetary policy. Late in the intermeeting
period, the Bundesbank returned to the use of variable rate tenders in its
one-month RP allocations, which were made at or above the Lombard rate of 8-
1/2 percent and well above the prior fixed rate tender of 8 percent. The
yield on the German bellwether bond declined slightly, though not as much as
long-term yields in Japan and the United States, and German stock prices
increased more than 5 percent.

IV-12
In late November, the yen depreciated and Japanese stock prices
declined amid rumors of financial difficulties at Japanese real estate
firms; however, stock prices recovered to their previous levels after oil
prices declined sharply. The yield on the Japanese bellwether bond declined
about 75 basis points, and Japanese short-term interest rates changed
little.

Amid heightened expectations of monetary tightening in Germany,
spreads among the EMS currencies widened. The French franc became the
weakest of the EMS currencies within the narrow band, and its spread against
the mark exceeded 1 percent.
Official
interest rates in the Netherlands and in Belgium were increased about 40
basis points in response to the rise in short-term German interest rates.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Real GNP growth slowed somewhat in Japan in the third quarter from its
rapid second-quarter pace, but it was negative in the United Kingdom and
Canada. More recent indicators such as industrial production, orders and
sales, point to a continued general slowing in the fourth quarter in these
countries. Economic activity continues to be weak in Eastern Europe. In
contrast, real GNP in Western Germany grew almost 7 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
the third quarter and French growth appears to have rebounded as well.
Inflation appears to be moderating in most foreign industrial
countries, as the increases in oil prices have now been largely passed
through. However, inflation has continued to rise in most Eastern European
countries. Gradual progress towards the reduction of external imbalances
has continued, although some countries, notably France, have recently
recorded larger external deficits. Eastern European nations continue to run
surpluses in hard-currency trade, but the higher cost of oil imports and the
decline in CMEA trade have begun to have a negative impact.
On December 9, Lech Walesa won the second round of the Polish
elections. On December 2, Chancellor Helmut Kohl won a clear victory in the

IV-14
first election for a democratic United German parliament since 1932. After
failing to win a large enough majority in the Conservative party leadership
contest, Margaret Thatcher announced her resignation as U.K. Prime Minister
on November 22. The new Prime Minister is John Major, former Chancellor of
the Exchequer.
Individual Country Notes. There is increasing evidence that the pace
of Japanese economic activity may be slowing. Real GNP grew 4.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter after growing more than 6 percent in the
first half of the year. Slower growth in the third quarter was mainly due
to weak consumption (up 1.4 percent) and less buoyant plant and equipment
investment (up 7.2 percent, the first single-digit rise in over a year).
Most recent monthly indicators of activity also suggest some slowing of
growth. Retail sales (s.a.) declined 3 percent in October, and new
machinery orders (s.a.) fell 10.6 percent in September. New passenger car
registrations (s.a.) were down 1.7 percent in October, their second
consecutive monthly decline. The rate of capacity utilization (s.a.)
declined 2.5 percent in September. Business bankruptcies (n.s.a.) jumped
21.4 percent in October, registering their first increase from year-earlier
levels in nearly six years. Housing starts (s.a.) declined 3.2 percent in
October, the fourth decline in five months. In contrast to these weaker
indicators, industrial production (s.a.) rose 2.5 percent in October.
Recent evidence on inflation trends has been somewhat ambiguous.
Although the consumer price index in the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) fell 0.1
percent in November, the 12-month increase jumped to 3.9 percent, the
highest since August 1982. However, seasonally-adjusted consumer prices
excluding perishable food products registered a 12-month increase of only
2.9 percent in October. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) were unchanged in October
and were only 1.5 percent above year-earlier levels. The yen's appreciation

and higher oil prices have had a varied impact on wholesale prices of
different goods. In October, the wholesale price of exported goods fell 2.8
percent while the price of imported goods rose 2 percent and the wholesale
price of domestically produced goods increased 0.3 percent.
The current account surplus (s.a.) continued to decline in the third
quarter and in October was only slightly above its third-quarter rate.
Through the first 10 months of this year, the current account surplus was
$39.5 billion (s.a.a.r.), $23 billion below the surplus rate in the same
period last year.
West German real GNP increased 6.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third
quarter, after falling 3.5 percent in the second quarter. The strongest
component of final demand was exports, which rose almost 30 percent due to
an acceleration of shipments to Eastern Germany. Equipment investment rose
11 percent, but this was the only category of domestic demand that showed
significant strength. Total domestic demand was up only 1.8 percent.
Industrial production in Western Germany (s.a.) fell 1.1 percent in October
to a level 5.2 percent above the same period in 1989. However, the
Economics Ministry stated that an upward revision of the October figure was
very likely. The volume of new orders for manufactured goods (s.a.)
increased 0.2 percent in October. Most of the recent strength in orders
came from domestic orders (including orders from Eastern Germany) which were
16 percent above year-earlier levels in October, while foreign orders were
up only 1.9 on the same basis. The unemployment rate (s.a.) fell in
November to 6.7 percent.
Unofficial estimates suggest that East German real GNP (n.s.a.) fell
24 percent in the third quarter to a level 31 percent below that of a year
ago. All categories of domestic demand declined except public consumption.
The bulk of the decline in real GNP was accounted for by a sell-off of

IV-19
inventories and a sharp increase in imports. After collapsing in July and
August, industrial production in Eastern Germany (n.s.a.) actually increased
2.2 percent in September. Nevertheless it remained 51 percent below its
year-earlier level. Official East German unemployment (n.s.a.) was 6.7
percent in November, up from 6.1 percent in October. The number of workers
engaged in government subsidized "short-time" work (n.s.a.) increased only
0,8 percent in October to 20 percent of the labor force.
West German consumer prices (n.s.a.) fell 0.1 percent in November to a
level 3.1 percent above a year ago. In October, wholesale and producer
prices were only 1.6 and 2 percent above year-earlier levels, respectively.
West German import prices (n.s.a.) increased 2.4 percent and 1.3 percent in
September and October, respectively, due almost exclusively to increases in
oil prices. They are up only 1.1 percent above year-earlier levels partly
as a result of the strong appreciation of the mark over the last year.
The combined German trade balance (n.s.a.) was $66 billion (a.r.) in
October, compared with $55 billion in the third quarter. This compares with
a West German trade balance of $75 billion for the third quarter of 1989.
The combined German current account (n.s.a.) was $41 billion (a.r.) in
October compared with $35 billion in the third quarter.
Initial data for the third quarter indicate that activity in France
picked up somewhat after a very slow second quarter. Marketable real GDP (a
preliminary indicator of total GDP) grew 5.3 percent (s.a.a.r.), after a 0.4
percent rise in the second quarter. Third-quarter activity was boosted by
investment and exports, which rebounded from poor second-quarter figures,
and stockbuilding, which surged. French consumer prices (n.s.a.) rose 0.5
percent in October, to a level 3.9 percent above a year ago. Non-energy
prices rose 0.3 percent. Wage growth (n.s.a.) slowed to a 0.9 percent pace
in the third quarter after a 1.7 percent rise in the second quarter. On a

IV-20
twelve-month basis, wages in the third quarter were up 4.8 percent, while
consumer prices were up 3.4 percent.
French trade and current account data remain erratic, but point to a
deterioration in recent months. The trade deficit (s.a.a.r.) deepened to
$15.2 billion in the third quarter from a $4.7 billion annual rate in the
first half of the year, although the deficit moderated in October. Imports
have surged, partly due to appreciation of the franc against the dollar.
In Italy, monthly indicators suggest that the pace of economic
activity slowed in September and October. Industrial production (n.s.a.)
was roughly constant (after an adjustment for working days) in September and
for the third quarter as a whole, relative to a year earlier. Capacity
utilization in September was 78.1 percent (n.s.a.), down from 80.8 percent
in June. Other indicators for October, such as orders and retail sales, are
down from year-earlier levels. Consumer prices (n.s.a.) were up 6.5 percent
in November from their level a year earlier.
As a result of rising oil prices, Italy's trade deficit was $1.8
billion (s.a.) in October, compared with an average monthly deficit of $750
million in the third quarter. The trade deficit for the first 10 months of
1990 was down 8 percent from the same period last year. Despite this
improvement in the trade balance, a doubling of the deficit in services
caused Italy's current account deficit to increase to $12 billion (n.s.a.)
in the first half of 1990, from $9 billion a year earlier.
The United Kingdom appears to be in recession. The output measure of
real GDP fell 4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter after growing 2
percent in the previous quarter. Manufacturing production fell 1.1 percent
in September, the fifth successive monthly decline. In the third quarter,
manufacturing output was 1.8 percent lower than in the previous quarter.
Total industrial production declined somewhat less as oil production

IV-21
recovered. The unemployment rate edged up to 6 percent in October while
retail sales volume fell 1.1 percent to a level slightly below a year ago.
The year-over-year rate of consumer price inflation remained at 10.9
percent in October, but the underlying rate of inflation (excluding the
effects of the poll tax and mortgage interest payments) rose to 8.3 percent.
Producer price inflation has been more moderate and stood at a 12-month rate
of 5.8 percent in November. Wages have continued to rise rapidly; the
underlying rate of increase was 10.2 percent in the year to October.
Canadian real GDP declined 1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter,
about equal to its fall in the second quarter. Final domestic demand fell
1.7 percent (s.a.a.r.), although consumption expenditures rose 1.1 percent.
Investment spending was particularly weak, declining 20 percent (s.a.a.r.)
in the third quarter. Signs of fourth-quarter weakness are abundant.
Unemployment (s.a.) rose again in October to a rate of 9.1 percent, up 2
percentage points from April. In October, housing starts (s.a.a.r.) fell 35
percent and bankruptcies were up 61 percent from a year ago.
The external sector did not contribute to growth in the third quarter,
as the fall in real imports was matched by a decline in real exports.
Canada's current account deficit (s.a.), however, stood at $3 billion in the
third quarter, down from $3.6 billion in the second quarter. The deficit is
likely to narrow further this quarter as higher oil prices boost export
earnings and weak demand reduces import growth.
Led by higher gasoline prices, the consumer price index (n.s.a.) rose
0.8 percent in October to a level 4.8 percent above its year earlier level,
up from 4.2 percent in the three previous months. Excluding food and
energy, the CPI rose 0.5 percent in October, and inflation remained at 4.0
percent on a year-over-year basis. Major wage settlements (n.s.a.)

IV-22
accelerated to 6.5 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, compared with a
pace of 5.4 percent in the second quarter.
Developments in East European Economies
Poland's first presidential elections have left the economic reform
program in limbo. The pattern of voting in the first round of elections on
November 25 demonstrated dissatisfaction with current economic policies, but
Walesa, who won the runoff on December 9, has indicated that he will
continue the general thrust of the current program.
In October industrial sales by state-owned firms advanced 10 percent
over September, but remain 21 percent below October last year. Monthly
inflation continued to rise; prices were up 5.7 percent in October, in part
due to wage acceleration and the pass-through of higher world oil prices.
The National Bank of Poland raised interest rates again in November to 55
percent to combat inflation; this is the second increase since August.
Poland's hard-currency trade surplus improved to $3.7 billion through
October. Following declines earlier this year, imports posted positive
growth in September and October. The oil bill was the primary cause, but
imports of capital goods have also been strong.
Faced with a rapidly deteriorating situation caused by the Gulf
crisis, dissolution of CMEA trade, and drought, Hungarian authorities
proposed completing the transformation to a market economy with a shock
program of further liberalization of prices and foreign trade and
accelerated transfer of state-owned enterprises. The plan was rejected by
the Cabinet, however, and Finance Minister Rabar threatened to resign
because of policy differences with the administration's top economic adviser
Matolcsy.
Industrial production contracted about 10 percent in the first eight
months of 1990. However, production at smaller enterprises increased 21

IV-23
percent over the same period. Inflation will likely exceed 30 percent at an
annual rate by the end of this year as subsidies are eliminated and energy
prices are passed through. The National Bank of Hungary tried to keep the
underlying rate of inflation low by restricting domestic credit growth
through September to about 5 percent, about half that for last year.
Hungary achieved a hard currency trade surplus of $890 million in the
first ten months of 1990. Export performance was strong despite poor
agricultural performance due to drought. Imports increased only 2 percent.
Exports to Germany were particularly robust, up 41 percent.
In the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, gross industrial output by
the state-owned sector fell 3.7 percent in the first eight months of 1990
compared with a year earlier. The decline was concentrated in the mining,
heating and power, and arms-producing sectors. Consumer prices have
increased markedly in recent months as subsidies have been removed. The
average level of the CPI in the third quarter was 14.1 percent above a year
earlier. In contrast, production prices were flat measured on that basis.
To combat inflation, the State Bank increased the discount rate from 5 to 7
percent in September after increasing it from 4 percent in August.
Negotiations on a letter of intent for a stand-by arrangement of 90
percent of quota (about $844 million) and drawings under the newly created
oil element of the compensatory and contingency financing facility (CCFF)
have been completed. The program is expected to be approved by the IMF
Executive Board on January 7. The World Bank is preparing three types of
loans: a Structural Adjustment Loan of $450 million, a Financial Sector
Rehabilitation project loan of $150 million, and technical assistance loan
of about $50 million to be focussed on energy, the environment, and
telecommunications.

IV-24
The CSFR has normalized trade relations with the United States; a
trade agreement that provides for most-favored-nation treatment including
GSP was signed, a bilateral investment treaty is being negotiated, and OPIC
coverage is available. President Bush, on his recent visit to the CSFR,
indicated that he would ask Congress to authorize a $60 million investment
fund for the CSFR, similar to the Hungarian-American and Polish-American
Enterprise Funds.
Economic Situation in Major Developing Countries
After failing to meet third-quarter performance criteria, Argentina
obtained IMF approval of a second modification to its stand-by arrangement
and resumed drawing on a reduced arrangement. Negotiations between the
Brazilian government and the commercial banks are held up by a disagreement
over payment of a portion of the interest arrears. Economic and political
conditions there are deteriorating. The Mexican anti-inflation pact has
been extended to the end of 1991 with a reduced rate of peso crawl and
increases in minimum wages and energy prices. Real appreciation of the peso
and a resumption of moderate growth this year have helped to fuel a surge in
imports. The bank financing and debt reduction package for Venezuela is
scheduled to close on December 18. Agreement in principle has been reached
on a bank financing package for Colombia. The Philippines and the IMF have
tentatively agreed on a stand-by arrangement to replace the discontinued
Extended Fund Facility. In Korea, real GDP is continuing to grow rapidly,
while inflation and the current account deficit are worsening due to the
rise in oil prices. In Taiwan, industrial production turned up in October.
Narrower trade surpluses in October and November, due to the rising value of
oil imports, portend a lower fourth-quarter current account surplus.
Individual Country Notes. In late November, Argentina obtained IMF
approval of a second modification to its stand-by arrangement, after failing

IV-25
to meet third-quarter performance criteria, owing to large shortfalls in
revenue collection. A waiver for a small deviation from the second-quarter
performance criteria was also obtained, allowing the drawing for that
quarter to take place. However, the SDR 184 million drawing contingent on
third-quarter performance was eliminated.
The authorities have continued to implement their program of economic
reform. On November 21, the state airline, Aerolineas Argentinas, was sold
to a consortium led by the Spanish airline Iberia for $2 billion in debt
paper and $250 million in cash. A decree approved November 26 is intended
to eliminate roughly 120,000 state jobs over the next few years; progress to
date in cutting public payrolls has been slow, but the authorities are
believed to be more serious about implementing this latest measure.
Since September, Argentina's economic performance has improved to some
extent. Monthly inflation declined from 15.7 percent in September to 7.7
percent in October, and to 6.2 percent in November. The fiscal operating
balance, which was in deficit by about $8 million in September, is believed
to have been in surplus by roughly $80 million in October. The November
fiscal accounts are expected to benefit from the cash payments associated
with the privatization of Aerolineas Argentinas and of ENTEL, the state
telephone company, which was sold in early November. The December 3 revolt
by a dissident military faction, which was suppressed quickly, is not
expected to have adverse consequences for economic performance or policy.
Negotiations between the Brazilian government and the commercial banks
are held up by a disagreement over payment of a portion of the interest
arrears. The government maintains that no agreement on the interest arrears
is possible until an overall debt restructuring package has been drawn up.
The banks are pressing for a Brazilian commitment to pay a part of the
arrears before discussions continue. Lack of progress in the negotiations

IV-26
has held up IMF Executive Board consideration of a stand-by arrangement of
SDR 1,449 million (about $2 billion). However, inflation has not fallen to
levels expected when the nominal targets were set under the arrangement, and
it is likely that new targets will have to be negotiated. Lack of progress
also held up consideration of IBRD and IDB loans totaling $700 million.
These loans were approved in late November, but no further loans are
expected to be considered until the bank negotiations show progress.
Economic and political conditions in Brazil are deteriorating. Real
GDP is estimated to have been 4.5 percent lower in the third quarter of 1990
than a year earlier. In September, industrial output was 7.5 percent less
than a year earlier. Monthly inflation was 16.7 percent in November, up
from 14.2 percent in October. The trade surplus for the first ten months of
this year was $9.7 billion, down from $14.1 billion in the same period of
1989. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a large number of firms continue to
seek protection from creditors because of the high real interest rates and
low product demand. Real interest rates have fallen as a result of the
central bank's easing of monetary policy. However, they continue to reflect
expectations that the government will attempt another confiscation of
financial assets in lieu of a fiscal reform. Indications are that the
government lacks the support needed to carry out the needed reforms. The
president's standing in opinion polls is down, and his supporters lost key
governorships in the November elections.
On November 11, the Mexican anti-inflation pact among government,
business, and labor, which was scheduled to expire at the end of January,
was extended to the end of 1991 with a reduced rate of peso crawl, an 18
percent increase in minimum wages, and increases in energy prices of from 10
to 30 percent. The new rate of crawl is 40 centavos per dollar per day,
half as high as it had been since late May.

IV-27
The pact extension was followed by a sharp drop in interest rates. At
the November 13 auction, the rate for 28-day Treasury bills fell by 2.95
percentage points to 23.9 percent (about 2 percent per month). However, the
market soon judged that this was likely to yield a negative real return,
given the prospect of higher monthly inflation rates in the near term
following the wage and price increases. As a result, upward pressure on
interest rates developed. At the December 4 auction, the 28-day rate was
25.5 percent, and the authorities kept the rate from rising further by
issuing only half of the 28-day bills they had offered. In fact, the CPI
rose by 2.7 percent in November, and is now 30 percent above a year earlier.
The peso price of the dollar was only about 12.2 percent higher at the
end of November than a year earlier, resulting in a real appreciation of the
peso in 1990, which, together with a resumption of moderate growth, helped
to fuel a surge in imports. Imports were 30 percent higher in August and
September than a year earlier. As recently as January-April, they were only
14 percent higher. For January-September, imports were 22 percent higher
than in the same period of 1989, whereas non-oil exports were only 9 percent
higher. With the recovery of oil prices, oil exports were 10 percent higher
in January-September than a year earlier, but the nine-month trade surplus
was only $1.1 billion, half as large as in the same period of 1989.
The surge in imports reflects a rise in demand that has helped real
GDP growth to recover from its first quarter low of 1.8 percent. Compared
with a year earlier, growth was 2.3 percent in the second quarter and an
estimated 3 percent in July-August. For January-August, it was 2.3 percent.
The 1991 public sector budget calls for an overall deficit of 1.9
percent of GDP, down from an estimated 4.3 percent in 1990. The entire
reduction reflects an expected decline in public sector interest payments to
7.9 percent of GDP from 10.4 percent in 1989.

IV-28
The bank financing and debt-reduction package for Venezuela is
scheduled to close on December 18. As of December 5, banks holding about 99
percent of the public sector medium- and long-term debt have subscribed to
one of the five options. They have committed $1.4 billion for a buyback at
a 55 percent discount (completed on October 18), $1.8 billion for principal
reduction, $7.5 billion for permanent interest reduction, $3 billion for
temporary interest reduction, and $6 billion for the new money option.
In November, pressure for appreciation of the bolivar stemming from
the Gulf crisis eased. This enabled the central bank to reverse its
decision of last August to resist this pressure by allowing the annual yield
on three-month bills to fall below the rate of inflation. The annual yield
on these bills rose to 28 percent last month from 17 percent in early
October. However, the real yield remains negative, since the CPI rose by
2.9 percent in November, or by nearly 41 percent at an annual rate.
On November 9, Colombia and its bank advisory committee reached
agreement in principle on a commercial bank financing package providing up
to $1,775 million to help refinance the $1.9 billion in maturities coming
due during 1991-1994. The loan will consist of a $200 million bearer bond
issue and a syndicated loan for as much as $1,575 million. Subscriptions to
the loan are expected to be completed by February 1991.
The Philippines and the IMF have reached tentative agreement on a new
stand-by arrangement to replace the discontinued Extended Fund Facility.
Final IMF approval of the new arrangement, which is expected to free about
$700 million in funds for the Philippines from various sources, is to occur
after the government has fulfilled preconditions of the proposed program by
enacting new tax measures, raising domestic fuel prices, and taking other
specified actions. Congressional leaders, who had blocked earlier tax
proposals, have agreed to enact new tax measures.

IV-29
Korea's real GDP was 9.6 percent higher in the third quarter than in
the same period of 1989. In November, consumer prices were 9 percent higher
than a year earlier, down from 10 percent at the peak in July. However,
wholesale prices have increased fairly rapidly since July, partly reflecting
higher oil prices. Retail oil prices were raised by about 28 percent on
November 25, the first increase in nine years, signaling higher consumer-
price inflation rates ahead. There was a record current account deficit in
October, due to deliveries of oil contracted for after the Gulf crisis
began. The January-October current account was in deficit by nearly $1.3
billion, in contrast with a $3.8 billion surplus in the same period of 1989.
In Taiwan, industrial production was 1.7 percent higher in October
than a year earlier, after falling below year-earlier levels for most of the
year. The 12-month inflation rate was 3.9 percent in November. The current
account surplus for January-September was $8.4 billion, nearly unchanged
from the same period of 1989. However, the trade surplus narrowed in
October and November, as the value of crude oil imports surged, suggesting a
smaller current account surplus in the fourth quarter.
