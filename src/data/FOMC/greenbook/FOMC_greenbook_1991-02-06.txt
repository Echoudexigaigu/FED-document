The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The Commerce Department's advance estimate indicates that real GNP fell
2.1 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. The dearth of first-
quarter data makes the rate of contraction after year-end difficult to
gauge. However, a few considerations suggest that the steepest part of the
decline in output may be behind us. In particular, motor vehicle
assemblies, which reached a very low level in December, apparently moved up
a bit in January. Production cuts elsewhere have kept inventories under
good control in most sectors. Furthermore, although much uncertainty exists
about the effects of the Persian Gulf conflict, the drop in oil prices
following the Allied attack, if sustained, should provide some support for
economic activity. Wage increases slowed last quarter, suggesting an easing
of domestic cost pressures. Nonetheless, the trend in underlying inflation
of retail prices has receded only slightly in recent months.
Employment and Unemployment
The labor market softened further in December, but apparently not as
sharply as in the preceding two months. Although the civilian unemployment
rate rose an additional 0.2 percentage point to 6.1 percent, the decline of
76,000 in total payroll employment was considerably smaller than the job
losses posted in October and November. An increase in the average workweek
pushed up aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers for a
second consecutive month in December, after the extraordinary plunge in
October. For the fourth quarter as a whole, both the workweek and
employment declined significantly, pushing down aggregate production-worker
hours at a 4.2 percent annual rate (chart on payroll survey).

Although the payroll employment losses in December were not so deep as
those of the preceding two months, they were again widespread. The
diffusion index of one-month employment changes, which has remained below
50 percent since last August, stood at 42.6 percent in December.
Manufacturing lost an additional 33,000 jobs in December, and construction
employment fell 28,000 after job losses averaging about 75,000 per month in
October and November. In the private service-producing sector, employment
fell 23,000 in December, largely because of another sizable drop in retail
trade, where hiring for the holiday season was slower than usual.
Employment also fell in finance, insurance, and real estate, the fourth
consecutive monthly decline. Only the services industry posted an
employment increase in December, boosted by the 56,000 jobs added in health
services.
Unemployment rates increased in December for virtually all major
demographic groups. The number of job losers and the number of individuals
involuntarily employed part-time continued to rise (chart on household
survey). In addition, although the labor force participation rate ticked up
in December, it remained below its year-ago level. Part of the continued
weakness in labor force growth reflects a rise in the number of discouraged
workers--those who believe that no jobs are available to them.
In recent weeks, initial claims for unemployment insurance continued
to fluctuate around the 450,000 mark. Week-to-week movements in this series
must be regarded with some caution because they are inherently noisy and
because seasonal adjustment is especially difficult around year-end.
Moreover, historically, the cyclical position of the economy has proved hard
to infer from initial claims alone. In the postwar period, claims have

As a result of the Persian Gulf crisis, about 157,000 reservists are
currently on active duty, and the military expects to call up as many as
1. Initial claims are included as a component of the index of leading
economic indicators because they lead business cycle peaks; however, claims
are considered by BEA as a coincident indicator around troughs.

II-7
2170,000 more in coming weeks. At least half of the reservists already
called to duty are estimated to remain on private payrolls; thus, the call-
up accounted for no more than about 75,000 of the 565,000 drop in private
nonfarm payroll employment between August and December. The employers
facing the largest call-ups appear to be airlines, police departments,
private security services, and health services. There is little information
on whether employers have kept these positions vacant or filled them with
temporary help. 3
Industrial Production
Industrial production fell nearly 8 percent at an annual rate in the
fourth quarter of last year. A 1-3/4 million unit drop in motor vehicle
output directly accounted for about one-fourth of the decline in IP last
quarter; cutbacks at suppliers to the motor vehicle industry probably
accounted for about another fourth. Most other industries also cut back
production last quarter; declines were especially sharp for computers,
construction supplies, and a wide range of consumer durables excluding motor
vehicles. Although we cannot quantify the effect of the Persian Gulf
operations on production last quarter, output likely was supported by an
increase in military orders for such goods as food products, chemicals,
clothing, and some types of ordnance. 4
2. On January 18, President Bush signed an executive order raising the
number of reservists who can be on active duty from approximately 200,000 to
1 million. In addition, the tour of duty for reservists was extended from
ninety days to two years. However, the government has stated that tours
will last a maximum of one year.
3. Employers are required by law to hold open reservists' jobs for four
years, and for an additional year at the request of the government.
4. Production of defense and space equipment is estimated to have fallen
in the fourth quarter. Although orders for defense capital goods spurted in
December, the level of bookings for the fourth quarter as a whole fell 12
percent from the third-quarter average.

By slashing fourth-quarter output, domestic automakers appear to have
kept inventories under reasonably tight control; absent a further erosion in
demand, auto production is likely to stabilize or possibly pick up somewhat
in the coming months from the low December rate. Through late January,
domestic producers are estimated to have assembled autos and trucks at a
pace slightly above the 7-1/2 million unit rate recorded in December (FRB
seasonals).
Other weekly IP data for the first couple of weeks in January were
mixed: Production of steel continued to decline while output in energy-
producing industries increased slightly. More generally, the staff's series
on adjusted durable goods orders, which tends to lead IP by a month or two,
edged lower in December, continuing the downtrend evident since the middle
of last year. On balance, these indicators point to further declines in
industrial production in the near term, though the rate of contraction may
be slower than in the fourth quarter.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing fell further in December to
79.3 percent, down nearly 6 percentage points from its peak in early 1989.
In most industries, operating rates at year-end were down substantially not
only from their recent peaks but also from their averages during 1967-90.
Utilization in primary processing industries, which was still fairly high by
historical standards last summer, has dropped more than 5 percentage points
since July.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal personal income rose nearly $34 billion at an annual rate in
December. An increase of $27 billion in wages and salaries, which more than
reversed the declines in the preceding two months, accounted for the bulk of

II-12
this rise. In real terms, disposable personal income increased 0.5 percent
in December, after edging up in November. However, even with these
increases, real DPI declined at about a 1-1/2 percent annual rate over the
last six months of 1990, depressed by the spurt in consumer energy prices
between July and October.
Consumer demand during the holiday shopping season was lackluster.
Real PCE for goods other than motor vehicles was about flat in December and
remained considerably below the levels seen earlier in the year. Real
outlays for apparel were notably weak in December, falling 2 percent, not at
an annual rate. There is some evidence from the BEA data that consumers
bought tobacco, alcohol, and jewelry in advance of the January 1 effective
date of the new taxes on those items. Although spending increases in those
categories were modest, we believe that spending for these items would have
been substantially weaker absent the influence of the new taxes. This
hypothesis can be reexamined a month from now when we receive revised data
on spending in December and new data for January.
Moving beyond the so-called control category, consumer demand for motor
vehicles remained tepid in December. Spending for consumer services rose
nearly 1 percent in December, boosted by a jump in outlays for electricity
and natural gas from the low November levels. However, for the fourth
quarter as a whole, real spending on services increased only 0.7 percent at
an annual rate, well below the gains registered earlier in 1990.
With nominal income and personal outlays up by roughly comparable
amounts in December, the personal saving rate held steady at 4.2 percent.
Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the personal saving rate has averaged
about 4.0 percent--nearly 1 percentage point below the average of the first

II-13
seven months of 1990. In an arithmetic sense, about half of this decline
reflects the higher gasoline prices that have prevailed since August:
Nominal PCE for gasoline increased from 2.2 percent of nominal disposable
personal income in the first seven months of 1990 to 2.6 percent in the
period since August.5 An increase in gasoline prices could reduce the
saving rate either if the non-gasoline components of consumer spending
adjusted with a lag to changes in real income or if the runup in energy
prices were expected to be short-lived. 6 Note that both explanations
point to a rebound in the saving rate, provided that the jump in energy
prices indeed proves to be temporary.
Consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board index, fell in
January from the already low December level. The Conference Board provided
separate tabulations of the responses received before the January 16 Allied
attack and those received thereafter. Although the index rose about 4 index
points after the attack, the post-attack level--at 56.7--was still below the
December reading, with further deterioration evident in almost all
components of the index. At this point, the results from the Michigan
survey for January are still incomplete. Based on the 70 households polled
over January 16-20, consumer sentiment improved markedly just after the
Allied attack and expectations about inflation moderated somewhat. However,
5. The increase since July in prices for fuel oil and coal has been even
sharper than for gasoline, but real consumption of these items has declined
dramatically, leaving nominal spending about unchanged relative to nominal
DPI. In comparison with the price increases for either gasoline or fuel oil
and coal, the increases since August in prices for electricity and natural
gas have been modest.
6. It is difficult to assign precise weights to these two hypotheses,
though both probably have some merit. Surveys of consumer long-term
inflation expectations, which showed a marked increase in August, provide
some evidence against the explanation that households treated the energy
price increase as temporary.

II-14
we would caution against reading much into this apparent improvement in the
consumer's outlook because of the small sample and because the euphoria
evident early in the war might not have been sustained.
Autos and Light Trucks
Unit sales of new cars and light trucks were about unchanged in
December from their November level, at a 12.7 million unit annual rate.
Domestically produced cars sold at a 6.6 million unit annual pace--up about
1/4 million units from the previous month. In the first twenty days of
January, the average selling pace for these cars is estimated to have been
around 6 million units at an annual rate. Even accounting for the
apparent downward bias in the first twenty-day figures--due to difficulties
in seasonal adjustment of transplant sales--the sales pace thus far in
January appears to have been slightly below the fourth-quarter average.
Sales of domestically built light trucks weakened in December and stayed at
that lower level through the first 20 days of January.
Sales of imported cars slowed in December to a 2.3 million unit rate
even though purchases of high-priced cars soared as consumers bought aheadof
the January 1 introduction of the excise tax on vehicles priced over
$30,000. On a not-seasonally-adjusted basis, unit sales of Mercedes were
up 37 percent from the November level; BMWs, up 27 percent; and Jaguars, up
64 percent. All told, unit sales of imported models with base prices over

January incorporates an estimate for Chrysler that is based on the
assumption that Chrysler sales in the first 20 days were the same fraction
of GM and Ford sales that they were in the past year.
8. The existing "gas-guzzler" tax on low-mileage cars was doubled
effective January 1, but this tax reportedly affects relatively few models.

II-15
$30,000 jumped about one-third in December; in contrast, sales of lower-
priced imports declined 6 percent. Sales of high-priced domestic makes also
increased in December, though apparently by a lesser amount, in part because
fewer of these domestic cars are priced substantially above $30,000.

In December, domestic automakers cut production from the anemic
November pace of 5.4 million units (annual rate, BEA seasonals) to
4.8 million units. With sales outpacing production by a substantial margin,
inventories of new cars fell at the end of the month to 1.29 million units,
or about 60 days' supply at the average selling pace for December; however,
by failing to count the large stock of nearly-new cars soon to be recycled
by the rental companies to dealers, this figure tends to understate the
effective inventory of cars. In contrast to the largely satisfactory
inventory situation for new cars, inventories of light trucks continued to

run quite heavy. At the December sales pace, the year-end stock of light
trucks on dealers' lots represented nearly a 100-day supply.
Business Fixed Investment
Real spending for business fixed investment fell 4-1/2 percent at
an annual rate in the fourth quarter, according to BEA's advance
estimate. Business outlays for motor vehicles dropped sharply, after the
third-quarter spike in fleet sales, while aircraft purchases stayed at the
robust third-quarter level. 10 Excluding the transportation sector,
equipment investment rose at a 7-3/4 percent annual rate, mainly because of
strong increases in spending for computers; in contrast, outlays on
industrial equipment were flat. Investment in structures plummeted,
reflecting large declines in the commercial, industrial, and institutional
sectors.
Recent data point to softness in equipment spending in the current
quarter. In nominal terms, new bookings for nondefense capital goods
excluding the aircraft group were down 1/2 percent (not an annual rate) in
the fourth quarter. Bookings for office and computing equipment have
been especially weak, with the recent declines pushing the fourth-quarter
level of this series 6-1/4 percent below the third-quarter average.
Moreover, based on the January sales figures for autos and light trucks,
9. December shipments of nondefense capital goods were close to what BEA
had assumed and suggest little revision to the advance estimate of PDE.
10. The Census Bureau was unable to release data on shipments of complete
civil aircraft from the Current Industrial Report (CIR) for either October
or November 1990 because the composition of shipments by manufacturer was
such that public release would have violated confidentiality restrictions.
Thus, for the advance estimate of fourth-quarter PDE, BEA used shipments of
complete nondefense aircraft as reported in the M3 survey.

business purchases of motor vehicles likely were sluggish early in the
current quarter.
The near-term outlook is even weaker for structures, as indicated
by information on building permits and contracts. As shown in the top panel
of the chart, contracts for total private building have trended sharply
lower for the past year and a half. This series has proved to be a fairly
reliable leading indicator, signaling each of the three downturns in
nonresidential construction during the 1980s. The falloff in contracts
likely reflects several factors. Most important, office and other
commercial space continues to exceed current demand, even though the pace of
total commercial construction already has fallen more than 20 percent from
its peak at the end of 1985. In addition, with the rate of capacity
utilization in manufacturing down sharply since early 1989, the pace of
industrial construction appears to be softening Aside from these demand-
side factors limiting activity, anecdotal reports suggest that some
worthwhile projects--particularly in the commercial sector--have been denied
financing as part of the general shift to tighter lending standards. We
have no way of estimating the extent of the financing constraint; however,
we believe it to be of secondary importance when compared with the negative
fundamentals on the demand side.
According to the recent Commerce Department survey of business
capital spending plans--taken in October and November of last year--firms
expect to increase nominal outlays 2.4 percent this year, after an estimated
5.2 percent rise in 1990. Much of the expected slowdown occurs in
manufacturing, where the Commerce survey estimates a 4.6 percent gain for
1990 but only a 0.7 percent rise in 1991. Although the survey has been a

Business Inventories
Since late last summer, businesses have trimmed their stocks in
reaction to sluggish sales and to expectations of additional economic
weakness. From August to October, constant-dollar inventories in
manufacturing and trade were reduced at an annual rate of $9.6 billion.
Inventory adjustments apparently continued in November as industrial
producers slashed their output further. Nonetheless, with the sharp
decline in factory shipments and in sales at many types of wholesale
distributors in that month, total manufacturing and trade inventories
increased somewhat on net.
In manufacturing, real stocks declined at an average annual rate of
$5.9 billion between August and November. Virtually all of the recent
decumulation was in stocks held by petroleum refineries--likely the result

of the Persian Gulf developments and not directly related to domestic
demand. Outside of petroleum, factory stocks were little changed, on net,
from August to November. Stocks of finished goods also were flat, even with
the large decline in shipments. The absence of a sharp runup in inventory-
sales ratios for most industries suggests that factory stocks continued to
be tightly managed through late last year.
In the trade sector, real inventories outside of auto dealers rose at a
$13.8 billion annual rate, on average, in October and November after
moderate liquidations in the preceding two months. The Census current-cost
data suggest that this increase largely reflected the notable accumulations
of machinery inventories at the wholesale level and of general merchandise
stocks at the retail level. In each case, the accumulation was accompanied
by flat sales and likely was unintended. Elsewhere in the trade sector,
stocks seemed to be generally under control late last year.
By historical comparison, businesses adjusted their inventory positions
11relatively promptly over 1990 (chart). Assuming that the BEA's estimated
inventory changes for the fourth quarter hold up, it appears that stock
imbalances at present probably are less serious than in the early phase of
previous cycles and will not require as much correction. Inventories also
should be less of a restraint on production when the recovery in final
demand begins.
11. The chart includes the cycles only since 1959 because no constant-
dollar inventory data exist for earlier cycles. The 1973:Q4-1975:Q1
recession was excluded, as inventory decumulation was delayed until the
sixth quarter after the cyclical peak.

Housing Markets
Housing construction declined further in the fourth quarter. Total
housing starts fell to an annual rate of 987,000 units in December, more
than reversing the gain of a month earlier; the average pace of starts in
the fourth quarter stood about 7 percent below that recorded in the
preceding quarter. In addition, the issuance of building permits declined
during each month of the fourth quarter.
In the multifamily sector, starts moved erratically through the fourth
quarter, but, on average, were down 5 percent from the third-quarter pace.
This drop was considerably smaller than those posted earlier in the year.
The cumulative decline in starts since 1985 has reduced the pace of activity
by two-thirds, and the current level of activity may be near the floor in
the market, given the diversity of demands across regional markets and the
need to replace the existing stock. Although the vacancy rate for
multifamily rental housing units declined from 9.5 percent in the third
quarter to 9.0 percent in the fourth quarter, the most recent observation
remains high by historical standards.
Starts in the single-family sector edged down to 755,000 units at an
annual rate in December, the lowest figure since October 1982, and permit
issuance decreased slightly. In the fourth quarter, single-family starts
were down 8 percent and remained generally well in line with permit
issuance.
Despite the continued decline in single-family construction, recent
sales developments raise the possibility that demand has begun to firm.
Sales of existing homes edged up 2 percent in December, following a
3 percent rise in November. New home sales also increased 3 percent in

November. In part, the pickup in sales may reflect improved housing
affordability. Home prices have trended lower in recent months, as
indicated by median and average pric s of existing homes after seasonal
adjustment by the Board's staff (chart). 12 Affordability also has been
enhanced by a decline of about 50 basis points in interest rates on fixed-
rate mortgages during November and December.
The slowing pace of construction, combined with small increases in
sales, is gradually helping to align the inventory of unsold homes with
sales; the inventory-to-sales ratio for new homes edged down from 8.3 months
in September and October to 7.8 months in November. However, even with this
decline, the supply of homes relative to sales remains high by historical
standards and likely will continue to limit new construction of single-
family units in the near term.
Tighter requirements for construction loans have been mentioned as
another factor likely constraining residential construction. A survey of
homebuilders in January suggests that lending restrictions have tightened
since last spring. The proportion of respondents reporting that changes in
lending practices affected building or development plans rose from 60 to
70 percent. The perceived effect was particularly strong in the Northeast
and for firms engaged in multifamily or commercial construction or in land
development. Small builders seem to have been affected less than medium-
sized and large firms. According to builders, tough actions by regulators
12. The recent price declines could reflect, in part, a shift in sales
composition toward smaller, less expensive units, because the price series
do not account for changes in the structural characteristics or geographic
mix of homes sold. Constant-quality new home prices for the fourth quarter,
which adjust for changes in the mix of structural attributes, will not be
available until early February.

and examiners were the reason most frequently cited by thrifts and
commercial banks in explaining the stiffer lending policies. Although the
loans-to-one-borrower limit was cited by two-fifths of the builders noting a
tightening of credit by thrifts, this factor had been even more widely cited
in the earlier survey.
Federal Government Sector
The Administration announced that Operation Desert Shield cost
13$10 billion in calendar year 1990. 13 For the year ahead, the total cost of
the Gulf military operations obviously will rise far above that figure now
that war is under way. However, the ultimate cost still cannot be estimated
with any precision, largely because of uncertainty about the duration and
intensity of the air and ground action. Before the Allied attack, the
Congressional Budget Office released cost estimates for the Persian Gulf
military operations based on different war scenarios. These are estimates
of the costs incurred since last August, not just the costs of the war
itself. The CBO estimates range from $28 billion to $86 billion; the lower
figure assumes a war lasting several weeks with limited ground action, and
the higher figure assumes a war lasting several months with repeated ground
assaults.
For any given war scenario, the CBO estimate assumes the full
replacement of lost equipment and munitions drawn down from defense stocks.
However, full replacement of most items is unlikely, because of the planned
reductions in the size and readiness of the military. Even if the desired
stocks of certain "smart" weapons increase because of their apparently

have been incurred in normal circumstances.

II-30
impressive performance, the build-ups in these areas probably will not
offset the more general trend toward downsizing.
Whatever the ultimate cost of the Persian Gulf operation, only a
portion of it will be reflected in this year's defense outlays. So far, the
Department of Defense has increased orders for some items--such as the
Patriot missile--to support the ongoing war effort. Over the coming months,
additional orders are likely to be placed to replenish stocks drawn down in
the war. The long lead times for acquisition of missiles and aircraft
suggest that the increased production would be spread over several years.
The CBO assumes, for example, that only $13 billion to $26 billion in
additional outlays would show up in FY1991. 14
The financial assistance recently offered by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Germany, and Japan--on the order of $40 billion since the war began--will
offset a substantial portion of the cost of the war. These pledges augment
the $8 billion in cash and in-kind contributions pledged last year, of which
$6 billion already has been received.
Turning to other fiscal developments, the CBO and the Administration
announced their economic assumptions for the FY1992 budget. Both sets of
assumptions include two consecutive quarters of negative real GNP growth,
which activates the recession provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act. The
Senate must vote, and the House may vote, on suspending the budget targets.
The Senate Budget Committee voted unanimously against suspending the
enforcement provisions. However, the measure still must be considered by
the full Senate. If it and the House vote to suspend the targets, the

resolution will go to the President, who has said that he would veto such
legislation.
The Treasury's data on outlays and receipts for the first three months
of FY91 show a deficit of $87 billion, compared with a $71 billion deficit a
year earlier. Outlays were $41 billion, or 14 percent, higher than a year
earlier. The major entitlement programs for health, low-income support, and
retirement accounted for $15 billion of the increase, with outlays for
deposit insurance--at $15 billion--representing another $8 billion of the
rise. National defense expenditures were $7 billion higher, but nearly half
of the increase was due to a shift in military pay dates. Among smaller
programs, international affairs, agriculture, and education showed
substantial increases over a year earlier.
Receipts in the first quarter of FY1991 were 11 percent above a year
earlier, largely reflecting stronger corporate profits tax receipts and
social insurance contributions; receipts also were boosted by the $4 billion
in cash contributions from our allies to support Operation Desert Shield.
Gross corporate income tax collections totaled $23 billion in December,
about $4 billion above the year-earlier total. Nonetheless, for the
calendar year as a whole, these collections were a bit below the 1989
level.
Real federal government purchases of goods and services, excluding CCC,
grew at almost a 10 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter (NIPA basis).
Real defense purchases rose at a 15 percent annual rate, reflecting
Operation Desert Shield and accelerated deliveries of aircraft. Real
purchases of nondefense goods and services, excluding CCC, declined at a

II-32
6 percent annual rate because the employment of temporary Census workers
ended.
State and Local Government Sector
The deficit of state and local operating and capital accounts rose
sharply, to about $45 billion, in the fourth quarter, largely because of
slower growth in personal and indirect business receipts. 15 In addition,
real purchases of goods and services climbed 4 percent at an annual rate
largely because of a surge in construction spending in October and November.
The increase in the NIPA deficit measure reflects widespread
deterioration in the finances of state and local units. According to a
December survey by the National Conference of State Legislators, 29 states
are facing potential deficits in their general fund accounts. Much of the
recent fiscal erosion is directly related to weakness in economic activity
and the consequent shortfall in tax collections relative to the continued
uptrend in outlays. To balance their budgets, many states are expected to
institute broad spending cuts. For example, in Michigan, the governor has
proposed that most functions be reduced about 9 percent from previously
planned levels.
At the local level, New York City is planning layoffs, a property tax
hike, and other measures to deal with a projected budget gap of more than
$2 billion in fiscal year 1992. Among governmental authorities, the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, charged with cleaning up Boston
Harbor, is cutting spending by 10 percent; however, court-ordered
construction projects are expected to proceed on schedule.
15. An official fourth-quarter deficit has not been published; however,
the given estimate is implicit in BEA's 1990 annual figure.

II-33
Labor Costs
Recent data on labor costs have been relatively favorable.
Compensation per hour, as measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI), rose
3.8 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter after
a rise of 4.3 percent in the third quarter. These moderate gains offset
larger increases earlier in the year such that, over the year as a whole,
hourly compensation in private industry rose 4.6 percent, a bit more slowly
than in 1989. Slightly smaller wage increases in 1990 accounted for the
deceleration compared with a year earlier; benefit costs rose more rapidly.
The deceleration in compensation costs over the second half of 1990 was
evident both in wages and salaries and in benefits. Wage and salary
inflation has come down markedly since June, and stood at 3.1 percent (at an
annual rate) in the September-to-December period. Benefits costs continued
to outpace wages in the fourth quarter, owing in large part to health
insurance costs; however, benefits costs also increased more slowly than
earlier in the year (which saw a boost in contributions for social
insurance).
By industry, the goods-producing and service-producing sectors
registered similar increases in compensation costs in the fourth quarter,
but this masks large differences at the more disaggregated industry level.
In particular, compensation costs in construction decelerated to 1.5 percent
in the fourth quarter, apparently reflecting the weakness in activity in
that industry. Compensation costs in manufacturing also decelerated. In
the service-producing sector, compensation gains in services and in
transportation and public utilities picked up a bit, while gains in
wholesale trade remained low, and gains in finance, insurance, and real

estate plummeted. The slow compensation gains in these last two industries
owe largely to a sharp deceleration in the earnings of sales workers. In
fact, weakness in earnings of sales workers in a variety of industries
contributed importantly to the slowdown in the ECI in this past year. While
compensation costs as a whole decelerated slightly between 1989 and 1990,
compensation costs for workers other than sales workers increased slightly.
By occupation, the recent deceleration in compensation costs was
particularly large for white-collar workers; in the fourth quarter,
compensation gains for white-collar occupations were smaller than gains for
blue-collar occupations. For the year as a whole, however, compensation
increased 1/2 percentage point faster in white-collar occupations than in
blue-collar occupations. Similarly, by bargaining status, the recent
deceleration comes from non-union workers only; the ECI for workers in the
unionized sector has not slowed in recent months.
Separate data on major collective bargaining agreements indicate that
wage adjustments in new union contracts last year were about the same as in
1989. First-year wage adjustments averaged 4 percent in both years
(excluding lump-sum payments and COLAs). When the parties that bargained in
1990 last negotiated--two or three years ago--first-year wage adjustments
averaged 2.3 percent. The distribution of first-year wage adjustments in
1990 was more tightly concentrated around the mean of 4 percent than in
1989. Last year, 85 percent of the settlements had first-year increases
between 0 and 6 percent, up from 73 percent in 1989. Continuing the trend
of recent years, only 4 percent of the agreements in 1990 called for wage
cuts or no wage change in the first year, down sharply from the figure of
about 30 percent when these parties last negotiated.

Although private employers are under no legal obligation to continue
pay or benefits to reservists called up for active duty, one private survey
indicates that more than half of employers will continue some salary
payments, generally making up the difference between workers' military and
private salaries. This practice will tend to raise unit labor costs.
However, to date, the effect has been small--probably raising the level of
labor costs at most 0.1 percentage point over the period of the call-up.
Prices
Inflation slowed toward the end of last year as prices eased for energy
and food. The CPI rose 0.3 percent in both November and December, and the
PPI for finished goods declined 0.6 percent in December, more than retracing
its November increase. Over the twelve months of 1990, these measures rose
about 6 percent and 5-1/2 percent, respectively, the largest increases
registered since 1981, mainly because of the surge in energy prices.
The CPI for energy fell 0.4 percent in December, the first monthly
decline since the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis. With the retreat in
crude oil prices, the retail price of fuel oil fell about 3-1/2 percent.
However, the decline in gasoline prices was only 0.3 percent in December
because of an offsetting 5 cents per gallon increase in the federal excise
tax. Even with the downturn in December, prices of both fuels remained
30 percent or more above their levels at the end of 1989. In contrast, the
prices of electricity and natural gas were up less than 2 percent over the
year.
Survey data suggest that retail prices of petroleum products declined
further through late January. Spot and posted prices of crude oil have
moved wildly since December, both before and after the outbreak of war.

This month, through January 29, posted prices of West Texas Intermediate
crude oil have averaged about $24 per barrel, and spot prices have averaged
a bit above $25, approximately $2 below their December levels (chart). With
the decline in crude oil prices, margins for petroleum products have widened
in recent weeks to a relatively high level. Further discussion of recent
events in oil markets is provided in the International Developments section.
Food prices edged up only 0.1 percent in the December CPI, as large
declines for fresh vegetables and dairy products about offset increases for
meats, fresh fruits, and other foods. However, over 1990 as a whole, the
CPI for food rose 5.3 percent, similar to the increases posted in 1988 and
1989. The January index is likely to be boosted by higher prices for citrus
fruit and some vegetable crops because of the crop losses sustained during
the December freeze in California. By contrast, increases in dairy
production have been pushing milk prices down sharply at the farm level, and
the passthrough of these declines seems likely to carry over into 1991. In
addition, this past year's plunge in wheat prices has led to a slowing of
the price trend for cereals and bakery products. Meat prices continued to
rise rapidly in the fourth quarter, as supplies remained below the levels of
a year earlier; however, steer prices have dropped back in January, and
futures prices for steers currently point to further declines in the months
ahead.
Apart from food and energy, the CPI rose 0.3 percent in November,
0.4 percent in December, and 5.2 percent for 1990, as compared with annual
increases of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent for the preceding three years. Prices
of nonfood, nonenergy commodities, which were unchanged in November,
advanced 0.4 percent in December, boosted by a sharp increase for tobacco

products. Despite numerous reports of holiday season discounting by
retailers, the discounts appear, on average, to have been about in line with
seasonal norms and thus had little effect on the December CPI. In January,
higher federal excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and
luxury items are expected to add an extra 0.1 percentage point to the total
CPI.
The CPI for nonenergy services advanced 0.3 percent in December. The
December rise included further large increases for airfares, reflecting the
continued passthrough of earlier rises in fuel costs. During 1990, the
prices of nonenergy services rose 6 percent, 3/4 percentage point more than
in the preceding year; airfares were responsible for about half of this
acceleration, rising 23 percent. The acceleration also reflected a pick-up
in inflation for medical services, lodging away from home, and a variety of
other services. Despite the sharp increase in owners' equivalent rent over
the first half of 1990, this component of the CPI did not accelerate over
the year as a whole; the 4.8 percent rise over 1990 compares with a
5.1 percent increase over 1989.
At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for intermediate materials
less food and energy edged down 0.2 percent in December, as declines for
nonferrous metals and industrial chemicals more than offset increases for
other materials. However, prices rose sharply further for some petroleum-
related materials, such as plastic resins and materials. Prices of crude
nonfood materials less energy fell 1-3/4 percent, mainly reflecting
declines--for the third consecutive month--in prices of metal scrap and
ores. This index was little changed, on net, over the past year.

APPENDIX
NBER DATING OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE PEAK FOR 1990
The NBER Committee on Business Cycle Dating has indicated that a
recession began sometime during the summer or early fall of 1990. This
appendix examines recent data on economic activity in order to narrow the
range of dates that the NBER might select as the latest business cycle peak.
To determine the dates of business cycle turning points, the NBER
committee examines the co-movements of a large number of macroeconomic
series. The turning points of these individual series tend to be clustered
together, and the month in which the central tendency of this cluster falls
is designated by the NBER as the general business cycle turning point.
Previous applications of the NBER methodology indicate the macroeconomic
series that are especially important in determining cyclical timing. 1 These
series are listed in table 1, along with a chronology of their recent
individual cyclical peaks. In the past, a few of these series have
experienced small but fairly regular deviations from coincident timing that
should be taken into account. In particular, the inverted unemployment rate
and number of unemployed (both of which peaked in March 1989) tend to lead
at business cycle peaks because employment typically rises more slowly than
the labor force in the late stages of expansion. Similarly, employee hours
often lead at peaks by a short interval, a tendency that reflects the much
longer and more systematic lead in the average workweek. Apart from these
series, turning points for most series are grouped in a fairly tight
"clustering zone" running from June through September, with employment
peaking first, in the early summer, followed by income, sales, and
2production.
1. For example, see Victor Zarnowitz and Geoffrey H. Moore, "The
Recession and Recovery of 1973-1976," Explorations in Economic Research,
vol. 4 (Fall 1977), pp. 471-557; and Victor Zarnowitz and Geoffrey H. Moore,
"The Timing and Severity of the 1980 Recession," in Geoffrey H. Moore, ed.,
Business Cycles, Inflation, and Forecasting, 2d ed. (Cambridge, Mass.:
Ballinger, 1983), pp. 11-17. In contrast to popular belief, the NBER's
criterion for declaring a recession has never been the occurrence of two
consecutive quarterly declines in real GNP.
2. The NBER committee focuses on the broadest measures of economic
activity; it has taken into account the effects of the temporary federal
Census hiring but has not necessarily excluded these effects from its
analysis. In any case, excluding the income generated by the temporary
Census employment (which peaked in June 1990 according to BEA estimates),
fails to change the dates of the peaks of any of the personal income
measures. Excluding Census employment (which peaked in May 1990) does
change the cyclical peaks in the employment series but not in a consistent
way: The peak in nonfarm payroll employment shifts from June to September,
the peak in nonfarm employment from the household survey moves from March to
February, and the peak in total civilian employment shifts from May to
March.

2. Following NBER convention, the monthly date for a peak in a quarterly
series is generally identified with the middle of the peak quarter.

II-A-3
According to the NBER methodology, the cluster of individual series
peaks in table 1 narrows the choice of the date of the 1990 business cycle
peak to either July or August. June appears to be too early, as three of
the components of the BEA's composite index of coincident indiators turned
down in later months. Furthermore, a June peak would be difficult, although
not impossible, to reconcile with the increase in real GNP in the third
quarter. September 1990 appears to be too late, as almost all of the
monthly series peaked earlier.
The choice between July and August requires an examination of the
magnitudes of movements in the data. In table 1, relatively flat peaks,
which may be consistent with closely neighboring dates, are not
distinguished from relatively sharp peaks. In addition, a look at the size
of the movements in the monthly data avoids reliance on peaks that may be
misdated because of spurious volatility in the series.
Table 2 examines the monthly movements in the composite coincident
index and its four components between April and November 1990. The level of
each series is shown along with its three-month centered moving average,
which smooths through some of the volatility but has little effect on
timing. Individual series peaks are shown in boldface type. The cluster of
individual turning points for the smoothed series is in July (table 2, last
row). Indeed, most of the percentage changes in table 2 are positive or
zero through July and are almost uniformly negative from August onward.
Thus, although August cannot be ruled out, July is the more likely date of
the business cycle peak in 1990, assuming that the NBER committee follows
its past procedures. However, the flatness that characterizes the peaks of
most of the series makes the choice of the overall cyclical peak more
sensitive to data revisions than would be the case if the individual peaks
were sharper.
3. Geoffrey H. Moore, a member of the NBER dating committee, has
expressed some preference for June as a cyclical peak, a selection that
appears to apply a large weight to the labor market data.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Financial markets were buffeted during the intermeeting period by year-
end pressures and by the prospect and reality of war in the Persian Gulf.
On balance, however, long-term interest rates are little changed and stock
prices are up slightly. Yields on Treasury bills have fallen about 1/2
percentage point, in line with easing steps by the System. Other private
market rates, especially very short-term, fell more than Treasuries as year-
end effects unwound. These year-end pressures, shortfalls in reserve
availability at the ends of maintenance periods, and the effects of
reductions in required-reserve balances have contributed to unusually
erratic movements in the federal funds rate.
Evidence of financial stress continues to mount. Defaults on low-rated
bonds, debt downgrades, and adverse dividend actions in 1990 were at their
highest levels in twenty years; deterioration was most acute at financial
institutions and below-investment-grade nonfinancial corporations.
Downgradings of municipal credits also rose markedly. Concerns about the
health of depositories probably were heightened recently by the closing of
privately insured depositories in Rhode Island, the takeover of the Bank of
New England, reports by several banks of sharply lower earnings in the
fourth quarter, and continuing discussion of the FDIC's solvency.
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses in both long- and short-term
categories has remained light in recent months. In municipal markets,
issuance of long-term debt has fallen sharply after a December pickup.
Available data on the household sector suggest that mortgage borrowing and
consumer credit have stayed subdued.

Growth in the monetary aggregates has remained sluggish. M2 has
advanced at only an estimated 2 percent annual rate this month, with the
increase accounted for by strong growth in money funds and currency.
Weakness in retail deposits has been particularly notable in the Boston
District, perhaps reflecting public concerns about asset-quality troubles in
those banks as well as the soft economy in the Northeast. Paced by rapid
growth in large time deposits, M3 increased at a 4 percent rate; however,
this growth did not seem to be associated with a pickup in depository
credit.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit 1
The weakness in M2 this month reflects in part a decline in
transactions accounts; OCDs have been flat, and demand deposits dropped at a
17 percent rate. A falloff in demand deposits has occurred in January for
several years; a new seasonal pattern appears to be evolving related to the
increasing dominance of transactions motives relative to compensating
balances in corporate demand deposits and may be behind the pronounced
2January decline. Meanwhile, retail nontransaction deposits are little
changed for the month, despite further declines in their opportunity costs.
Led by runoffs at the Bank of New England, the weakness in core deposits is
especially marked in the Boston District (chart). Weakness in retail
deposits continues to be accompanied by large purchases of Treasury
securities, as indicated by substantial noncompetitive tenders, and
1. The monetary data in this document incorporate benchmarks and updates
to seasonal adjustment factors that will not be made public until
February 7, 1991.
2. Evolving seasonal factors have tended to damp the declines, but
apparently are lagging behind the actual change in seasonal patterns,
leaving negative January growth rates for demand deposits in five of the
last six years.

III-4
according to industry sources, efforts by households to pay down revolving-
credit balances.
Partially countering the weakness in other components of M2 has been a
surge in money market mutual funds and currency. Inflows to money market
funds probably are attributable to a widening in the spread between money
fund yields and market interest rates, but concerns about the health of the
banking system also may be playing a role. The war in the Middle East
apparently contributed to an increased demand for U.S. currency abroad and
helped boost its growth to a 24 percent rate in January.

III-5
The modest show of strength in M3 in January owes primarily to a
rebound in large time deposits, which grew at an estimated 10 percent rate
after declining steadily over the last half of 1990. Rather than reflecting
any strengthening of demands for bank credit, however, the pickup in M3
growth owed to a shift in funding patterns away from nondeposit sources,
particularly borrowing from foreign offices.
Bank credit rose at a 2-1/2 percent annual rate in December, but
partial data for January show it declining this month. Holdings of
government securities fell at an 11-1/2 percent rate last month with banks
apparently running off investments to trim their balance sheets and to
realize capital gains before year-end. Total loan growth strengthened
slightly in December, with the increases recorded in real estate and
consumer loans. However, all of the gain in real estate loans was
associated with acquisitions by commercial banks of thrift assets rather
than new lending. The pickup in growth of consumer loans resulted, in part,
from a slowdown in securitization, as the higher rate spreads required by
the market on asset-backed securities around year-end led several banks to
postpone issuance. In January, consumer and real estate lending appears to
have weakened. Preliminary evidence from the January Senior Loan Officer
Opinion Survey of Bank Lending Practices indicates that banks tightened
somewhat their lending standards both for residential mortgages and consumer
loans in the October to January period.3 The survey also found that
demand for residential mortgages slackened a bit further in the last three
months of 1990.

presented in the supplement to the Greenbook.

III-7
C&I loan growth strengthened moderately late in November and December
when some lower-rated commercial-paper issuers borrowed from banks ahead of
year-end to avoid sharply higher costs in the paper market. Most of this
loan growth took place at branches and agencies of foreign banks, which have
been most active in the market for backup lines of credit in recent years.
Business loans at commercial banks dropped back early in January, perhaps
reflecting an unwinding of year-end borrowing; scattered reports suggest,
however, that some banks have had success retaining these A2/P2 credits by
bettering loan rates.
Nonfinancial Business Finance
Total borrowing by nonfinancial corporations appears to have weakened
somewhat in January. Gross public bond issuance was robust in December but
has fallen off in January as uncertainty increased about how interest rates
would respond to events in the Gulf. Business loans likely contracted this
month, and commercial paper outstanding has been flat.
Business credit at finance companies fell in November to a 4-1/2
percent annual rate from the double-digit rates recorded since summer.
Virtually all of the slowdown reflected a large decline in financing of
auto-dealer inventories. Contacts at finance companies suggest that
aggregate demand for business credit softened recently; however, finance
companies are gaining some market share relative to banks, particularly in
equipment financing and working-capital lending. Most recent data on bank
willingness to lend, from the January Senior Loan Officer Survey, indicated
further tightening in bank lending standards for all sizes of business firms
in the October to January period.

Access to nonbank intermediaries such as finance companies likely has
shielded many businesses from the cutbacks in bank lending. The overall
availability of credit to small businesses, as indicated by the National
Federation of Independent Business' monthly survey, was little changed in
December from its level in earlier months; although availability reportedly
tightened last year--especially in some parts of the country--the survey has
not suggested the existence of a substantial credit squeeze. Indeed, credit
access ranks low on the NFIB survey respondents' list of concerns.
Concern about the ability of firms to obtain financing at year-end was
significant, but pressures on interest rates waned quickly with the turn of
the calendar. Quality spreads in the commercial paper market, which widened
in late December to levels not seen since 1983, narrowed dramatically in
January (upper panel of chart). The reported willingness of the SEC to
consider less stringent limits on money funds' holdings of A2/P2-rated paper
also may have contributed to the reduction in spreads. Quality spreads on
longer-term investment-grade debt increased about 25 basis points over the
intermeeting period to about 140 basis points, steadily widening since the
invasion of Kuwait but much narrower than in the early 1980s (lower panel of
chart).
In equity markets, major stock indexes fell 4 percent or so from mid-
December to mid-January, reflecting concerns about the prospects for war and
generally disappointing earnings reports. With the start of the Gulf war
and the first optimistic assessments of its progress, major indexes
recovered around 4 percent on January 17, tripping circuit breakers in both
the cash and stock-index futures markets. Since then, stock prices are up

slightly, but the market continues to react skittishly to news about the
war.
Offerings of new shares by nonfinancial firms remained low in December
and January, and initial public offerings were extremely scarce. The MCA
acquisition was completed late in the fourth quarter of 1990, leaving a
light calendar of proposed mergers and acquisitions for the first few months
of 1991. Nonetheless, net equity retirements in the first quarter of 1991
could run at about the same moderate pace as in the previous quarter if the
acquisition of NCR by AT&T occurs.
Bond markets also were affected by uncertainty created by events in the
Persian Gulf. Some underwriters broadened "war-out" clauses, standard
fixtures in corporate-bond sales agreements between underwriters and
issuers. These clauses allow underwriters to cancel sales if hostilities
escalate and markets are disrupted. Underwriters also reportedly shortened
settlement periods to enhance further their protection against increases in
interest rates. The uncertainty generated by events in the Gulf likely
would have depressed issuance independent of these actions: Many issuers
and investors apparently were unwilling to enter the market at the start of
the conflict, but some issuers returned as the situation clarified.
Issuance of all types of asset-backed securities was a strong $5.1
billion in December, despite record spreads that caused several prospective
issuers to postpone their offerings. Banks and thrifts accounted for about
a third of this total as they sought to remove assets and enhance balance-
sheet ratios by year-end. Issuance fell sharply in January, again primarily
because of increased uncertainty about the effects of the Gulf war on
interest rates.

Financial Stress
Events in the Middle East are occurring against a background of
mounting financial stress in both the nonfinancial and financial sectors. A
record estimated $18.35 billion of corporate bonds defaulted in 1990,
representing 8.7 percent of the par amount of outstanding noninvestment-
grade bonds, the highest default rate since the Penn Central default in 1970
and more than double the rate in 1989 (chart). The number of debt
downgrades continued to far exceed the number of upgrades in the fourth
quarter, and for the year as a whole, downgradings reached a record high.
Most of these downgrades were attributable to deteriorating conditions
affecting financial institutions and below-investment grade nonfinancial
corporations. Signs of stress also were reflected in the number of
corporations reducing, omitting, or deferring dividends. While the number
of positive dividend actions was the smallest fourth quarter in more than
three decades, adverse dividend actions were only surpassed in 1958. These
dividend reductions and omissions also appear to be concentrated in
financial firms.
Stress in depository institutions in particular mounted over the
intermeeting period. Confronted with runs prompted by the failure of Rhode
Island's largest privately insured credit union, the governor of that state
ordered the closure of all privately insured depository institutions until
they obtained federal deposit insurance. Thirty-five credit unions and ten
banks having book assets of $1.7 billion were closed on January 1. Twenty-
three credit unions subsequently reopened with insurance provided by the
National Credit Union Administration. The failure of the insurance fund has
created political pressure at the national level for the termination of

III-14
private state insurance and for a closer monitoring of the federal credit
union insurance fund.
A week after the closure of the Rhode Island credit unions, the FDIC
took over the Bank of New England Corporation following announcement of an
estimated $450 million loss in the fourth quarter. Bond and stock prices of
other banks perceived to have serious asset-quality problems fell sharply
after the FDIC move. Among these troubled institutions was MNC Financial,
which was able to avoid defaulting on maturing bonds in mid-January by
borrowing from its bank subsidiaries. The loans to MNC were to be paid off
through the sale of credit-card operations in an initial public-stock
offering. This offering was brought to market in mid-January and raised
$950 million. Recently, Moody's downgraded the commercial paper, long-term
debt, and preferred stock of Citicorp. Immediate market reaction to the
downgrading was limited and did not extend to the debt of other bank holding
companies. Citicorp's preferred stock fell below investment grade, however,
likely constraining further this avenue for raising capital. Spreads on the
debt of money center banks relative to Treasuries have narrowed a little
over the past month, and despite the initial reaction to the Bank of New
England failure, bank stock prices are up slightly over the intermeeting
period.
Moody's recently completed a review of insurers' mortgage portfolios
that resulted in the downgrading of financial-strength ratings of four
firms: Equitable Life, Mutual of New York, Mutual Benefit Life, and Home
Life. These and other insurers reportedly have become more cautious in
extending new loans. A board member of one major firm recently noted that
his company has stopped making commercial real estate loans altogether. The

III-15
company's pullback partly reflects a sharp deterioration in the quality of
its own real estate portfolio, but it also reflects an expected
deterioration in the commercial real estate market more generally.
First Executive, the largest holder of junk bonds among life insurance
companies, is taking several steps to restructure its liabilities to both
senior debtholders and policyholders. Meanwhile, Executive Life is
discussing an assumption-reinsurance transaction with Hartford Life whereby
the latter would assume Executive Life's entire book of annual-premium life
insurance policies. These liabilities are valued at $2.3 billion, roughly
19 percent of Executive Life's total policy reserves. Company officials
fear that, in the absence of such an arrangement, continued unfavorable
publicity surrounding the company's investment portfolio will lead to
further surrenders of policies.
Treasury and Sponsored-Agency Financing
The federal deficit is expected to total $91 billion in the first
quarter of 1991, up $4 billion from last quarter. The staff expects that
the Treasury will hold constant the gross sizes of the weekly bill auctions
and forgo issuing cash-management bills. By contrast, borrowing in the
coupon sector is expected to increase somewhat. The Treasury recently
announced the decision to hold monthly auctions of five-year notes in lieu
of quarterly auctions of notes with five-year-and-two-month and four-year
maturities; the change will not have a large effect on borrowing in the
coupon sector for this quarter, however.
Spreads of government-sponsored-enterprise debt remain relatively
narrow by historical standards. In January, REFCORP exhausted its $30
billion borrowing authority by issuing $7 billion of bonds. The offering

consisted of $5 billion of new 30-year bonds and a $2 billion reopening of a
previously-issued 40-year bond. At the time of the pricing, the spread
relative to Treasuries on the 30-year debt was 29 basis points, in line with
previous offerings. However, that on the reopened 40-year issue, at 19
basis points, was considerably lower than any of the earlier 40-year issues.
Stock prices of FNMA and FHLMC have risen more than 10 percent since mid-
December. FNMA announced record earnings for the fourth quarter and, unlike
many depositories, does not appear to be plagued by asset-quality problems.
The RTC is requesting an additional $77 billion from Congress to
continue its cleanup of the thrift industry through the end of this fiscal
year. Thirty billion dollars would cover thrift losses, and the remaining
appropriation would cover working-capital needs. Without additional
funding, the RTC will exhaust its resources in February. Funding problems
have contributed to a slowing in RTC activities thus far in the first
quarter, but the agency continues to have difficulties disposing of assets
because of legislative restrictions, weak real estate markets, and
administrative problems within the agency. Nonetheless, RTC's portfolio
grows: Columbia Savings and Loan, with assets of some $7 billion at its
June quarterly report, was placed in conservatorship recently.
Municipal Securities
Issuance of long-term tax-exempt securities picked up in December,
buoyed by a rash of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds for
transportation services and for public buildings, correctional facilities,
and redevelopment agencies. The drop in yields during the month also
boosted refunding issuance, which had been little more than a trickle in the
preceding three months. Since December, long-term issuance has fallen off

III-18
sharply, owing to the uncertainty surrounding developments in the Middle
East. A backup in yields prior to the outbreak of war also damped refunding
volume. After falling in December, quality spreads on municipal securities
jumped in anticipation of the outbreak of war and, on net, are slightly
above mid-December levels.

Philadelphia averted bankruptcy in mid-January by selling $105 million
in three-month notes to city and state pension funds and local banks. The
notes yield 9.5 percent on an annual basis, but the annualized all-in cost
to the city is approximately 24 percent as a result of fees required by the
purchasers. The $105 million obtained by the initial sale will be enough to
bridge a gap in receipts and avoid default through the remainder of the
fiscal year ending in June.
After showing mild deterioration over the previous three years,
pressures on municipal credit ratings intensified in 1990 as the economy
slipped into recession. Standard & Poor's downgraded 474 ratings on $48.2

III-19
billion in debt, while only 131 ratings on $13.4 billion of debt were
upgraded. The bulk of the reductions was accounted for by 290 housing
ratings suffering from the downgrading of several banks and insurance
companies that provided credit enhancements. States and their agencies
fared best; 42 issues were upgraded, while only 26 were downgraded.
The credit quality of states is not likely to fare as well this year.
Budget woes continue to escalate and threaten to make fiscal year 1991 the
worst in nearly a decade. Twenty-eight states have stated that they must
cut spending or increase taxes to balance their budgets. Rhode Island,
which already had a large budget deficit, now is under pressure to reimburse
depositors suffering from the closure of its privately-insured credit unions
and banks. Fiscal troubles facing states are spreading from the East into
the West, and California and Arizona now project budget shortfalls of
approximately 5 percent of outlays.
Mortgage Markets
Given the continued weakness in housing activity, mortgage lending
volume likely remained subdued, and may have slowed, in the fourth quarter.
Growth of real estate loans at commercial banks was little changed from the
moderate third-quarter pace, while the disinvestment in mortgage assets at
SAIF-insured institutions proceeded. Reports continue to surface
periodically about the reluctance of lenders to extend credit in view of
concerns about credit quality of borrowers and stricter regulatory
oversight. According to recent trade reports, small- to medium-sized
mortgage bankers that are not affiliated with parent financial institutions
are the latest victims of credit stringency. Several such firms apparently
are experiencing difficulties obtaining warehouse lines of credit from

III-20
depositories to finance loan originations, although this credit restraint is
not thought to be a major problem in the industry. Indeed, there is no
indication, most notably in the spreads of mortgage rates over Treasury
rates, that potential homebuyers have faced any constriction of credit
availability.
The steepening in the Treasury yield curve over the intermeeting period
has been reflected in a widening in the initial rate differential between
fixed- and adjustable-rate loans. Yields on fixed-rate mortgages have risen
about 5 basis points, on net, while initial rates on ARMs indexed to the
one-year Treasury yield have declined about 20 basis points. The initial
rate spread has widened to about 190 basis points, but remains well below
the levels reached in 1987 and 1988 when the ARM share of loans closed
peaked at nearly 70 percent. Evidence of refinancings of ARMs into FRMs has
not appeared, despite reports that borrowers might find it attractive with
rates on FRMs now relatively low.
In secondary mortgage markets, yield spreads between agency pass-
through securities and comparable-duration Treasuries remain tight, despite
fairly heavy issuance of mortgage-backed securities. Monthly issuance of
federally related pass-throughs has averaged about $18 billion since mid-
1990, pushing total issuance for the year as a whole to near-record levels.
The new-issue volume has been augmented by large sales of securities
associated with thrift restructurings. The RTC, for example, has sold
roughly $17 billion of securities since March 1990, including a record block
of $883 million in December. This large volume was handled without adverse
effect on price spreads for mortgage-backed securities. Demand by
traditional investors other than thrifts has been strong, and new investors

III-21
reportedly continue to enter the market. Multiclass securities, primarily
REMICs and CMOs, have continued to absorb a sizable volume of pass-throughs,
with agency issuance in 1990 on a pace that should surpass the record 1989
volume. Issuance by securities dealers of multiclass pass-throughs also was
stronger last year than in 1989, despite tailing off toward the end of the
year.
A factor expected to help some lenders securitize their mortgage
originations is the recent increase in the ceiling on the size of
conventional loans eligible for purchase by federal agencies. FNMA and
FHLMC announced in late December that the maximum original-loan amount on

Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit grew at 2-3/4 percent seasonally adjusted
annual rate in November, near its October pace. Installment credit was
supported by a pickup in the non-auto, non-revolving category. Auto loans
outstanding contracted in November, the tenth decline in the past thirteen
months, although at a slower pace than October. Revolving credit growth
slowed further in November, in part reflecting larger-than-normal repayments
according to some lenders. Industry sources suggest this trend in paydowns
may be continuing into the new year.
For the first eleven months of 1990, growth in outstanding consumer
installment credit, at 3-1/4 percent, was the slowest since 1980 when credit
controls and a recession held the increase to a mere one-half of one
percent. The deceleration in 1990 was most noticeable in automobile credit,
which actually declined for the first time since 1980. In part, the decline
in auto loans reflected a general slackening in sales; however, the weakness
also may have been indicative of the availability or tax advantage of other
forms of financing, such as leasing or home-equity loans.
Gross public issuance of consumer asset-backed securities was about
$35 billion in 1990, some $10 billion stronger than the pace in 1989
(table). The preponderance of new public issues was securities backed by
credit cards and originated by commercial banks. GMAC also issued

the national-average home-purchase price as calculated by the FHFB's Monthly
Interest Rate Survey. According to the FHFB, the average price for a
single-family nonfarm home financed with a conventional mortgage was
$139,600 in early October, about 2 percent higher than in October 1989.

securities after several years' absence from the market. Some market
participants have suggested that fears of rising consumer delinquencies and
bankruptcies are lowering demand for credit-card-backed securities because
these problems lead to chargeoffs that trigger early amortization with the
associated prepayment risk for holders. However, only a few issues appear
to be close to the level of chargeoffs that would trigger early
amortization.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In November, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $9.7
billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis) from a revised deficit in
October of $11.0 billion. For October-November combined, the deficit was
larger than in any quarter since 1988-Q1. Exports increased faster than
non-oil imports, but these changes were exceeded by a sharp run-up in the
value of oil imports (a result of rising oil prices).

Nonagricultural exports in October-November were 6 percent above the
third-quarter average, with strong increases recorded in all major trade
categories except aircraft and computers. About half of the rise was in
industrial supplies, of which one-third was fuels. (See the table on the
next page.) By area, the largest increases were to Canada, Western Europe,
and developing countries in Asia. Much of the increase in nonagricultural
exports in October-November was in quantity.

Agricultural exports in October-November were 2 percent less than in
the third quarter, with much of the decrease attributable to prices
(especially for wheat). In addition, exports of corn and soybeans got off to
a slow start after the harvest, in part reflecting weak sales to the Soviet
Union.
Non-oil imports for October-November were 4 percent higher than in the
third quarter, with about half of the increase in quantity. The increase in
value was strongest in capital and consumer goods. The increase in
industrial supplies was primarily in chemicals and precious metals other
than gold. There was also a jump in imports of foreign-type passenger cars.
Most of the increase in non-oil imports came from Japan, Western Europe, and
Canada. Some of the higher value of non-oil imports resulted from an
increase in prices that was associated, in part, with the decline in the
foreign exchange value of the dollar. (See the discussion of prices below.)

In November, the value of imported oil dropped 8 percent following
sharp increases in the previous three months. The November decline was more
than accounted for by quantity. (See the table on the next page.) The
average quantity (mbd) for October-November was nearly 15 percent less than

in the third quarter. This decrease reflects the decline in U.S. economic
activity, the effects of mild weather, and slowdown in refinery runs in
order to perform maintenance. The price of oil in November was about the

same as published in October, and about $10 per barrel higher than the
average for the third quarter. The rise in prices of imported oil lagged
the sharp increases in posted and spot prices, following the same pattern as
in previous oil market disruptions.
Prices of Imports and Exports
BLS prices of imported oil dropped 6.7 percent in December, the second
month of decline. (See the table on the next page.) Nonetheless, the price
of imported oil in December was still nearly 90 percent higher than in July.
For the fourth quarter on average, oil prices rose 47 percent (not an annual
rate) above the third-quarter level.
Prices of non-oil imports rose at an annual rate more than 6 percent
in the fourth quarter, after having shown only small increases earlier in
the year. The strongest rises were in automotive products, capital goods,
and consumer durables (particularly professional and scientific apparatus);
part of these increases were associated with the depreciation of the dollar.
There were also increases in the prices of petroleum-related goods. Smaller

increases were recorded for prices of imported consumer nondurables, foods,
and industrial supplies (increases for fuels more than offset price declines
for other supplies and materials).
Prices of nonagricultural exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent
in the fourth quarter on a quarterly average basis according to BLS (4
percent on a fixed-weight GNP basis). Most of that increase was associated
with rising prices of exported fuels and other industrial supplies
(especially petrochemicals). Price increases for exported capital goods,
automotive products, and consumer goods were in the 2 to 4 percent annual
rate range in the fourth quarter. Prices of agricultural exports dropped
for the sixth time in the last seven quarters, led by declining prices of
grain, especially wheat.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Large net foreign official inflows into the United States were
recorded in October and November. (See the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions, line 4.) The G-10 countries increased their net holdings in
the United States as the result of intervention purchases of dollars and the
accumulation of interest earnings. Certain oil producing countries,
particularly in Latin America, also increased their holdings, as higher oil
prices produced larger export earnings. In addition, Spain and Isreal
increased their reserve holdings in the United States. Reports that Taiwan
shifted $35 billion out of U.S.-based banks and into U.S. Treasury
securities and foreign-based banks in late 1990 were false and subsequently
were denied in a press release by Taiwan's central bank.
Apart from official transactions, the net capital inflows that were
the counterpart of continuing U.S. current account deficits were not
apparent in the data available for October and November. Monthly data on
private securities transactions (lines 2 and 3) show only small net inflows

for these two months together. Net private purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities (line 3) were less than $1 billion. Foreign net sales of U.S.
corporate stocks (line 2b) were substantial in October, but ended in
November, as the U.S. stock market began to recover. U.S. residents bought
foreign securities net over the two months (line 2c). In contrast, there
were substantial net private foreign purchases of U.S. corporate and other
bonds (line 2a). However, new issues of Eurobonds by U.S. corporations,
which in October and November were only slightly below monthly averages for
the last several years, dropped sharply in December and do not appear to
have picked up in January.
Banks reported substantial net capital outflows on a month-end basis,
particularly in November (line 1). However, on a monthly average basis,
there were net inflows from own foreign offices and IBFs in October and
November, and again in December. (See line 1 of the International Banking
Data table on the next page.) Foreign-chartered banks more than accounted
for the December inflow.
Matsushita's $6 billion purchase of MCA was completed on December 29.
However, little direct investment capital inflow is likely to result
initially because about two-thirds of the necessary funds were raised in the
U.S. commercial paper market by Matsushita's U.S. subsidiary, Panasonic
Finance. Multinational companies in general apparently found it
advantageous to borrow in the United States in 1990; compared to earlier
years, foreign interest rates were high relative to dollar rates. As a
result of the shift in the location of funding, direct investment capital
inflows dropped sharply in the first three quarters of 1990 compared with
1989, despite the fact that the value of acquisitions of U.S. companies by
foreigners remained strong.

IV-10
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign-exchange value of the dollar, in terms of
the other G-10 currencies, is virtually unchanged on balance since the
December 18 FOMC meeting, as shown in the accompanying chart. The dollar
declined 1 percent against the yen and sterling but rose 3/4 percent against
the mark. The dollar showed wide swings over the period. The dollar rose
more than 3 percent in thin pre-Christmas markets amid concerns about dollar
funding for the year-end and remained firm until trading began for the new
year. Concerns about the deteriorating political situation in the Soviet
Union also contributed to the dollar's temporary strength, especially
against the German mark. Soon after year-end, the dollar rose sharply once
again as a Persian Gulf war began to look increasingly likely. Once the war
actually began, the dollar initially rose to highs of about ¥138 and DM1.55,
but within two hours the dollar had fallen 2 percent from its highs as news
of the strong first strike by Allied forces was seen as reducing uncertainty
about the outcome of the war and the extent of damage to oil supplies.
Short-term interest rates abroad were not greatly changed over the
period, except Canadian short-term rates, which declined by a full
percentage point. Japanese interest rates declined 5 to 10 basis points at
short maturities and about 30 basis points on the long end. German short-
term interest rates rose by as much as 25 basis points as the mark weakened
before January 16, but the subsequent strengthening of the mark and
disappointed expectations of an imminent Lombard rate hike reversed the
interest rate gains. In both Germany and Japan, stock prices declined
considerably in the run-up to war, rose sharply after fighting began, then
eased somewhat over the next two weeks. On balance, Japanese stock prices
are 4 percent lower than at the time of the last FOMC meeting while German

stock prices have declined about 6 percent, the latter weighed down in part
by Soviet political turmoil.
U.S. authorities did not intervene, but the Desk did convert yen funds
received from Japan to help the financing of the Persian Gulf war.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Growth in most major foreign industrial countries appears to have
slowed in the fourth quarter. Industrial production (s.a.) declined in
November in Japan and Western Germany and again in December in Japan. Other
recent indicators in these two economies have been mixed. After strong
growth in the third quarter, France and Italy showed signs of slowing in the
fourth quarter. In Canada and the United Kingdom, which both saw decreases
in GDP (s.a.) in the third quarter, preliminary data indicate continuing
weakness in the fourth quarter.
In most countries, data for November and December pointed to a
moderation of consumer price inflation, mostly because of lower oil prices,
although in January inflation picked up in Japan and Western Germany. Trade
and current account surpluses have decreased in recent months in Japan and
Germany. Trade deficits in France and the United Kingdom have moderated,
while Italy's has increased sharply.
Individual Country Notes. The pace of economic activity in Japan may
be slowing, although evidence remains preliminary and inconclusive. Housing
starts (s.a.) fell 5.4 percent in November, after four declines in the
preceding five months, and were 3.7 percent below their year-earlier level.
The number of new passenger car registrations (s.a.) declined by 2.8 percent
in December, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. Industrial production

IV-16
(s.a.) was down 0.5 percent in December, after declining 0.8 percent the
previous month. On a twelve-month basis, however, industrial production was
up 6.3 percent in December. In contrast, new machinery orders (s.a.) rose
3.8 percent in October, but remained 2.8 percent below year-earlier levels.
The capacity utilization rate (s.a.) increased 3.1 percent in October,
reaching its highest level since 1973. Labor market indicators also show
near-record degrees of tightness. The unemployment rate (s.a.) moved down
to 2.1 percent in November.
The consumer price inflation rate has moved higher in recent months.
Much of this increase has been attributed to transitory factors, especially
a jump in perishable food prices, but officials have also expressed concern
over underlying inflationary pressure arising from tight labor and capital
markets. Consumer prices in the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) increased by 0.9
percent in January, after remaining unchanged in December. The twelve-month
increase moved up to 4.2 percent in January, but was only 3.3 percent
excluding perishables. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) rose by 0.3 percent in
December, due partly to the weakness of the yen over this period, and the
increase from year-earlier levels rose to 2.2 percent.
The Japanese current account surplus has continued to decline. The
surplus in November was lower than in the same month a year earlier, as it
has been in all but two months since the beginning of 1989. In the first
eleven months of 1990, the current account surplus (s.a.) was $38.6 billion
(a.r.), $23 billion less than in the corresponding period in the previous
year.
On December 24, the Ministry of Finance presented to the cabinet its
draft budget for fiscal year 1991 (beginning in April). The proposed
general accounts budget (covering most spending programs) calls for a 2.7
percent expenditure increase from estimates for the current fiscal year

IV-17
(including supplemental spending measures). The proposed budget contains no
major tax initiatives. However, the additional $9 billion Persian Gulf
contribution announced last week appears likely to be financed by higher
taxes. (Japan also made a $4 billion Gulf contribution last year.)
Real GNP in Western Germany increased 4.6 percent in 1990. All
elements of final domestic demand were up sharply, while net exports
declined slightly. Although official figures for the fourth quarter will
not be released until April, the annual figures suggest that there was a
sharp deterioration in net exports in the fourth quarter.
Industrial production in Western Germany (s.a.) fell 0.5 percent in
November, but this is a provisional figure that is likely to be revised
upward. In November industrial production was 5.6 percent above the same
period in 1989. The volume of new orders for West German manufactured goods
(s.a.) fell 3.4 percent in November, although they remained 6.1 percent
above year-earlier levels. The West German unemployment rate (s.a.) fell
another 0.1 percentage point in December to 6.6 percent.
Industrial production in Eastern Germany (n.s.a.) increased 3 percent
in November, after small increases in September and October. For the third
quarter as a whole, however, industrial production was 48 percent below
year-earlier levels. East German third-quarter retail sales (n.s.a.) were
45 percent below their level in the same period of 1989. Official East
German unemployment (n.s.a.) was 7.3 percent in December, up from 6.7
percent in November. The number of workers engaged in government subsidized
"short-time" work (n.s.a.) increased 1 percentage point in October, to 20.3
percent of the labor force.
West German consumer prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.7 percent in January,
after being almost unchanged the previous two months. On a year-over-year
basis, consumer price inflation fell from 3.3 percent in October to 2.8

IV-18
percent in December, and then rose slightly to 2.9 percent in January. The
year-over-year change in consumer prices excluding energy remained between
2.4 and 2.6 for all of 1990. West German wholesale prices (n.s.a.) and
producer prices (n.s.a.) both fell 0.3 percent in December and were 0.3 and
1.5 percent above year-earlier levels, respectively.
The combined German trade balance (s.a.) dropped sharply in November
to $4 billion (a.r.). Exports (s.a.) were up 6 percent in November from the
average for the previous four months, but imports (s.a.) increased 21
percent over the same period. The combined German current account surplus
(n.s.a.) was $11 billion (a.r.) in November, compared with $39 billion
(a.r.) in July-October.
In December the Bundesbank announced that it will shift in 1991 from
targeting West German M3 to targeting M3 in all of Germany. The current
target range of 4-6 percent annual growth will be maintained. West German
M3 (s.a.) grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent from the fourth quarter of
1989 through December 1990.
The Federal budget deficit is estimated to have widened from DM 20
billion in 1989 to about DM 50 billion in 1990, somewhat lower than
previously expected. Virtually the entire increase can be attributed to
additional expenditures related to unification. If no changes in current
policies are made, the Federal deficit is expected to increase further to DM
105 billion (3-3/4 percent of GNP) in 1991. In recent negotiations over the
formation of a new government, however, policy changes were accepted that
will reduce the 1991 Federal deficit by DM 35 billion. In contrast with
statements prior to the December election, anticipated increases in revenues
(DM 20 billion) are larger than cuts in spending (DM 15 billion). The
agreed changes also include special tax breaks for Eastern Germany.
(Recently Germany announced that it will contribute $5.5 billion to the

IV-19
United States for expenditures related to the Gulf War, increasing Germany's
total contribution since the Gulf crisis began to $9.2 billion.)
In France, after a strong third quarter, preliminary data indicate
that activity slowed sharply in the fourth quarter. GDP (s.a.) grew 5
percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, although inventory accumulation
contributed 3.5 percentage points to this figure. After a 0.1 percent rise
in October, industrial production (s.a.) fell sharply in November and was
down 2.8 percent from its average level in the third quarter.
French inflation has remained moderate. The CPI (n.s.a.) fell 0.2
percent in November and another 0.1 percent in December. Inflation on a
twelve-month basis was 3.4 percent in December, down from 3.9 percent in
October and 3.6 percent in November. Excluding energy prices, twelve-month
inflation was 3.1 percent in December, the same as in October and slightly
above the November figure of 3 percent.
The French merchandise trade deficit (s.a.) narrowed from $15.6
billion (a.r.) in the third quarter to $12.8 billion (a.r.) in the fourth
quarter. For the year as a whole, the deficit expanded from $6.6 billion in
1989 to $11 billion in 1990.
Preliminary data from Italy indicate that GDP (s.a.) rose 2.8 percent
(a.r.) in the third quarter of 1990, following a small drop in the previous
quarter. Consumption spending and inventory accumulation were the prime
contributors to this growth. Industrial production (s.a.) declined 2.9
percent in October and another 0.8 percent in November.
Consumer prices rose 6.3 percent in December from their level a year
earlier, down from a 6.5 percent increase in November. Wholesale prices in
November rose 9.4 percent from their level a year earlier, down from 12.1
percent in the previous month.

IV-20
The trade deficit (s.a.) increased sharply in November to $33.6
billion (a.r.). The cumulative trade deficit for the first eleven months of
1990 increased roughly 25 percent from the same period a year earlier, in
part reflecting a deterioration in the energy balance.
According to preliminary data, the 1990 budget deficit was 10.7
percent of GDP, exceeding its target by 0.4 percentage points. In December,
Parliament passed the 1991 budget, which includes deficit-reduction package
of 3-3/4 percent of GDP.
Recent data provide evidence that the recession in the United Kingdom
is deeper than had been expected. Real GDP (s.a.) contracted 4.7 percent
(a.r.) in the third quarter, after rising 1.6 percent in the second quarter
of 1990. The decline in GDP was dominated by the largest drop in investment
since 1985. Exports, private consumption, and government consumption also
fell. In November, industrial output (s.a.) declined 1.4 percent to stand
2.8 percent below its year-earlier level. Unemployment rose for the ninth
consecutive month in December, reaching a rate (s.a.) of 6.5 percent.
Retail prices fell slightly in December to a level 9.3 percent above a
year earlier. This followed a marked decline in the year-over-year rate of
inflation in November, as the mortgage rate increase of 1989 dropped out of
the calculation and the 1990 mortgage rate cut took effect. Excluding
mortgage interest payments and the poll tax, the "underlying" rate of
inflation edged down to 7.7 percent in December from 8 percent the previous
month.
In December, U.K. external deficits narrowed, bringing the cumulative
trade and current account deficits for 1990 to $30 billion and $27 billion,
respectively, down from $38 billion and $31 billion in 1989.
Real GDP (s.a.) in Canada declined 1 percent (a.r.) in the third
quarter, following a slightly larger decline in the second quarter. All

IV-21
components of domestic demand except consumption fell, with real gross fixed
investment (s.a.a.r.) dropping 16.6 percent.
Continued weakness in economic activity is evident from fourth-quarter
indicators. Manufacturing shipments (s.a.) fell 3 percent in November
October retail sales (s.a.) decreased 0.3 percent in both October and
November. Unemployment (s.a.) rose for the sixth consecutive month in
December to 9.3 percent. Housing starts (s.a.) were down nearly 40 percent
in December from a year earlier.
Seasonal factors and lower fuel prices pushed the consumer price index
(n.s.a.) down 0.1 percent in December, while the index remained 5 percent
above its year-earlier level. Excluding food and energy, consumer price
inflation on a twelve-month basis fell to 4 percent in December from 5.5
percent rate a year earlier. Major wage settlements (n.s.a.) accelerated to
6.5 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, after moderating in the second
quarter to a 5.4 percent rate.
The controversial Goods and Services Tax went into effect on
January 1. The 7 percent, broadly based value-added tax replaces the
13-1/2 percent manufacturers' sales tax. Official government estimates
maintain that the tax will add 1-1/4 percent to the level of consumer
prices, although preliminary reports indicate that many retailers are
absorbing the tax in an effort to promote sales.
Developments in East European Economies
In Poland, data for November indicate that the recession is bottoming
out, although inflation continues to exceed the objectives of the reform
program, largely because of increases in real wages. Hungarian industrial
production continued to contract, but increasing production at medium-sized
firms suggests that industry restructuring is beginning to take effect. The
Czech and Slovak Federal Republic embarked on a program of sweeping economic

IV-22
reform on January 1. Industrial production in the CSFR for the first nine
months of 1990 was down compared with a year earlier.
Individual Country Notes. Poland's new government is taking shape.
President Walesa's choice for Prime Minister, Jan Krysztof Bielecki, has
indicated that he will conform to the Balcerowicz program in substance,
although with some greater priority to financial sector reforms. The
extended period of political uncertainty set key elements of the
macroeconomic program off-track. The IMF stand-by arrangement was allowed
to lapse when it was clear that renegotiated targets for wage and domestic
credit growth for the fourth quarter would not be met.
November data confirm the bottoming-out of the recession with
industrial sales by state-owned firms only 15.7 percent below November 1989
levels; on a month-over-month basis, sales have been rising the past two
months. The unemployment rate (in the non-agricultural sector) was 8.3
percent at the end of the first year of the reform program. Monthly
inflation continued to run higher than programmed, in part because of oil
prices, but more importantly because of a continued increase in real wage
costs.
Poland was required to dip into reserves after posting a hard-currency
trade deficit in November of $162 million, the first monthly deficit of
1990. International reserves remain comfortable, totaling $5.2 billion at
the end of December, up from about $2.5 billion at the end of 1989. Poland
has not used the $1 billion multilaterally sponsored Stabilization Fund,
which has been extended for another year.
The Hungarian government is negotiating two agreements with the IMF:
a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth about $1.5 billion and a
Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF) worth about $450
million. Key provisions of the EFF agreement are that the government budget

IV-23
deficit should not exceed 78 billion forints ($1.2 billion, about 3 percent
of GDP) and that growth in net domestic assets for 1991 should be limited to
14.6 percent. Parliament has passed the budget underpinning this program.
Industry restructuring is evident in production data. While
industrial production contracted about 10 percent in the first eight months
of 1990, production at enterprises employing between 50 and 300 people
increased 21 percent over the same period. The unemployment rate stood at
1.7 percent at year end. Inflation for the year was estimated to be 29
percent.
Hungary achieved a hard currency trade surplus of $0.9 billion in
1990, compared with a surplus of $0.6 billion in 1989. Trade is
increasingly oriented toward the European Community (EC), which now accounts
for about half of Hungary's trade. As part of its program to reach current
account convertibility by 1992, Hungary devalued the forint by 15 percent on
January 7.
The EC has approved the disbursement of the second tranche of the
$1 billion loan to Hungary that it arranged last year. In addition, the
G-24 is considering funding another $700 million loan.
January 1 marked the starting date for sweeping changes in the
structure and functioning of the economy of the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic. The most obvious changes involved liberalization of wages,
prices, foreign exchange, and trade. While price increases are apparent,
they are much less widespread and much smaller than when Poland freed prices
on January 1, 1990. The koruna exchange rate was unified at 28K/$, implying
a devaluation of about 14 percent of the business rate and a revaluation of
about 7 percent of the tourist rate. Import licensing and quota
restrictions were reduced (and are scheduled to be eliminated in May 1991),

IV-24
but a GATT-legal import tax of 20 percent was imposed on some consumer goods
to support the move to a convertible currency.
To back the reforms, the CSFR made drawings from its recently
negotiated IMF stand-by arrangement and CCFF agreement totalling about
$755 million. In the first two weeks of January, the CSFR State Bank spent
$170 million defending the new koruna rate. The EC is coordinating efforts
within the G-24 to design a $1 billion loan for the CSFR that would be
similar to the one for Hungary.
In the first nine months of 1990, gross industrial output fell 3.7
percent from a year earlier. In the same period, hard-currency exports and
imports were flat, yielding a trade deficit of about $88 million; the hard-
currency trade surplus was $419 million in 1989. As of mid-year 1990, more
than one-half of trade was with hard-currency countries, up from 35 percent
in 1989.
Economic Situation in Major Developing countries
In Brazil, rising inflation underscored the need for renewed
adjustment effort, but no steps have been taken to implement additional
stabilization policies. Lack of progress in negotiations between Brazil and
the commercial banks led the IMF to continue to hold up consideration of a
stand-by program. The Mexican economy registered stronger-than-expected
growth in 1990, and the government has not moved to restrain this activity;
inflation rose toward the end of the year, in part due to boosts in energy
prices. In Argentina, a run on the currency at the end of January
prompted a replacement of the economic team and may portend a rise in
inflation, which had continued to decline in December. In December 1990,
Venezuela completed its financing package covering almost all the country's
$19.7 billion medium- and long-term commercial bank debt. A debt
restructuring package for Uruguay is expected to be signed at the end of

IV-25
January 1991. The Philippines plans to sign a Letter of Intent for an IMF
package of stand-by and CCFF loans by early February, while the IMF approved
a 15-month stand-by loan for Nigeria. In Taiwan, a large drop in interest
rates led to a rebound in industrial production and exports during the
second half of 1990, while 1990 inflation reached 4.5 percent, the highest
rate since 1981. Inflationary pressures also increased in Korea in 1990,
and the Korean current account deficit widened substantially as well. The
governments of both these East Asian economies announced measures to
increase foreign access to domestic securities markets.
Individual Country Notes. In Brazil, inflation has been rising amid
fiscal pressures and skepticism about the prospects for the survival of the
Collor government's stabilization program launched last March. Monthly
inflation was 18.3 percent in December, compared with 15.6 percent in
November and 14.2 percent in October. Economic activity has continued to
decline. GDP registered an estimated 4.3 percent decline in 1990, and
industrial production in November was 9.4 percent lower than a year earlier.
Real interest rates remain high despite easing of monetary policy since
October, about 5 percent per month for 30-day corporate borrowing. Brazil's
trade surplus fell to $11.3 billion in 1990 from $16.1 billion in 1989.
President Collor's popular support appears to remain solid, despite
the worsening economic situation. The government has continued to resist
the reintroduction of mandatory wage indexation; Collor vetoed the latest
proposal from Congress in early January. However, observers believe that in
the coming months, after the newly elected Congress takes office in early
February, the government will need to announce new disinflation measures.
These are expected to include a wage and price freeze, but it is not known
what fiscal measures will be included.

IV-26
Brazil and its bank creditors remain far apart on the terms of an
agreement on the estimated $9 billion in interest arrears that have
accumulated through December 1990, and whether implementation of an
agreement on the arrears should be linked to an agreement on the remaining
stock of debt. Banks warned that short-term credit lines would continue to
decline if no agreement were reached. The IMF management continues to hold
up Executive Board consideration of a negotiated stand-by arrangement, the
Letter of Intent for which was signed last August, until Brazil makes
satisfactory progress with bank creditors. Disbursements on over 30 World
Bank loans totalling $3 billion are suspended, pending a report on overall
World Bank relations with Brazil that is scheduled to be ready in February.
Indications are that Mexico's 1990 real GDP growth may have been
around 3.5 percent, more than the 2.8 percent forecast. Recently released
data show a third-quarter annual growth rate of 5.5 percent and an upward
revision of the second-quarter rate to 2.8 percent. Fourth-quarter growth
is also thought to have been high. Imports through November were 26 percent
above the year-earlier level, up from 19 percent through June. Apart from
catch-up energy price increases in November, there has been no move to curb
growth. On the contrary, part of the windfall from the higher-than-expected
oil revenues is being spent on an anti-poverty program. With congressional
elections this summer, restraining actions are unlikely in the near term.
Domestic interest rates have fallen since mid-December. At the
January 22 auction, the 28-day Treasury bill rate was 23.5 percent, down
from 26.1 percent on December 18. Since mid-November, the 28-day rate has
been negative in real terms. Following the energy price increases, the CPI
rose 2.7 percent in November and 3.2 percent in December after rising by
only 1.4 percent each in September and October.

IV-27
The assurances provided by the anti-inflation pact that the peso price
of the dollar will increase by only 5 percent during 1991 appear to have
boosted demand for Mexican interest-bearing assets. However, the fall of
oil prices to pre-Gulf crisis levels and the ongoing real appreciation of
the peso portend a widening of the current account deficit that could
trigger an outflow of capital unless macroeconomic policies are tightened.
In December, a controlling interest in the state-owned telephone
system was sold for $1.76 billion to a conglomerate in which Southwestern
Bell and a French telecommunications company are investing $485 million and
$412 million, respectively. Half of the purchase price was paid in December
and the other half is due by the end of January.
In Argentina, a run on the exchange rate has clouded the future of the
disinflation program. The austral price of the dollar rose from roughly
6,200 on January 23 to 7,800 on January 28, after which a two-day bank and
exchange holiday was declared. The sharp run-up in the dollar reflected
strong monetary growth and poor fiscal performance in previous months, a
seasonal downturn in money demand, and the perception that the exchange rate
was overvalued and would have to depreciate to restore Argentina's
competitiveness. Economy Minister Antonio Erman Gonzalez and Central Bank
President Javier Gonzalez Fraga resigned in response to the exchange rate's
move; current Foreign Minister and former Central Bank President Domingo
Cavallo has been named as the new Economy Minister, but the new Central Bank
head has yet to be selected. These developments follow an earlier cabinet
reshuffling in mid-January, when a corruption scandal led the Ministry of
Public Works, long thought to be tainted by corruption, to be dismantled and
taken over by the Economy Ministry.
Consumer price inflation registered 4.7 percent (monthly basis) in
December, down from 6.2 percent in November and the lowest rate since

IV-28
December 1987. The decline reflected a seasonal strengthening of money
demand associated with the holidays, and took place in spite of rapid
monetary emission linked to extensive purchases of foreign exchange and
central bank financing of troubled provincial banks and the Social Security
System. In the coming months, inflation is likely to rise in response to
the sharp depreciation of the exchange rate and continuing fiscal problems
that will make monetary restraint difficult. In January, the government
also increased partial interest payments to commercial banks from $40
million to $60 million per month, compared with monthly interest obligations
in excess of $250 million; total interest arrears to commercial banks were
roughly $8 billion at end-1990.
In December 1990, Venezuela completed a financing package covering
almost all of the country's $19.7 billion in medium- and long-term external
debt to commercial banks. The package included a buyback (at 45 cents per
dollar of face value), a par bond swap (with a 6-3/4 percent fixed interest
rate), a discount bond swap (at a 30 percent discount), and a new money
option (20 percent increase in exposure over three years). Also in
December, the IMF approved a Venezuelan purchase of over SDR 1 billion
(about $1.4 billion). This total includes disbursements under Venezuela's
Extended Fund Facility and funds to support the reduction of commercial bank
debt and debt service.
Preliminary data indicate that Venezuela's real GDP grew about
4 percent last year after falling 8.3 percent in 1989. Annual consumer
price inflation declined from 81 percent in 1989 to 36.5 percent in 1990,
but monthly inflation jumped to 3.5 percent in December. A larger-than-
expected increase in oil export revenues last year contributed to a current
account surplus of $7.4 billion (about 13 percent of GDP) and international
reserve growth of $4.1 billion.

IV-29
The Philippines plans to sign a Letter of Intent for an 18-month IMF
stabilization program to replace the discontinued Extended Fund Facility by
early February, after it meets IMF policy pre-conditions. The financing
package will total SDR 543 million (about $765 million) and consists of a
SDR 264 million stand-by arrangement and SDR 279 million from the
Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility. The IMF Board is scheduled
to consider the program on February 20, and approval of the program is
expected to lead to the provision of additional funds to the Philippines
from non-IMF sources amounting to about $700 million. The Philippines will
also be seeking funds from its major official donors at a pledging
conference in Hong Kong on February 25-26.
Following prolonged negotiations, Nigeria received IMF approval of a
15-month SDR 319 million ($450 million) stand-by arrangement from the IMF on
January 9. As in its two previous stand-bys, Nigeria is not expected to
draw on this arrangement due to domestic political considerations.
By the end of January 1991, Uruguay is expected to have signed the
debt restructuring package with its commercial bank creditors originally
agreed to in October 1990. By mid-December 1990, all creditor banks had
agreed to participate, with $535 million (33 percent of debt) committed to
swaps, $628 million (39 percent) to buybacks, and $447 million (28 percent)
to a base for new money loans.
In Taiwan, a large drop in interest rates in the second half of 1990
contributed to a recovery in industrial production and exports. Industrial
production was 2.5 percent higher in November than a year earlier, and
exports were over 11 percent higher, the largest increase in over a year.

investment in Taiwan securities by foreign institutions starting in the
first quarter of 1991. In addition, the authorities will allow two foreign
securities firms, both U.S., to establish branches in Taiwan and to sell
foreign securities directly to local investors beginning this quarter.
In Korea, consumer price inflation rose to 9.4 percent in 1990 from
5.1 percent in 1989. The increase reflected strong domestic demand
stimulated by rapid money growth over most of 1990, as well as the pass-
through of oil prices to consumers at end-November. Korea's current account
deficit soared to $1.2 billion in November, bringing the cumulative January-
November current account deficit to $2.5 billion compared with a surplus of
$4.3 billion in the same period of 1989. The Korean Ministry of Finance
announced it will begin taking applications from foreign securities firms
for the establishment of domestic branches or joint ventures on February 1,
1991.
