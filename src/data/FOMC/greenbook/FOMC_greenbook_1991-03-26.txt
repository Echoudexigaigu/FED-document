The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Signals on the economy have become more mixed in recent weeks. Data
on employment and industrial output through February point clearly to a
further significant decline in real gross national product this quarter,
but there are hints that a bottom to the recession is near--the end of the
Gulf war has bolstered sentiment, consumer spending evidently turned up in
February, and housing activity has revived as well.
Wage increases seem to be abating, but news on the price front has
been ambiguous. In the producer and consumer price indexes, energy
prices have dropped sharply, but other prices rose faster in January and
February than in the preceding several months.
Labor Markets
Labor market conditions continued to deteriorate in February. Private
payroll employment fell 208,000, and the unemployment rate jumped
0.3 percentage point to 6.5 percent. Although aggregate hours of production
or nonsupervisory workers rose 0.3 percent in February because of a rebound
in the average workweek, the advance in aggregate hours retraced only part
of the sharp January decline; as a result, the February reading was about
1 percent below its fourth-quarter average.
The decline in employment in February was widespread across industries.
Manufacturing employment dropped 127,000, with the largest losses in durable
goods industries. Employers have eliminated more than 1 million factory
jobs since their number peaked in January 1989, with about 650,000 of the
jobs lost since last July. Employment in the construction industry edged up
in February, after falling especially sharply in January, when the weather

was unusually adverse; the average decline over the two months was similar
to that in the fourth quarter. Employment also fell in most service-
producing industries in February. Reductions were largest in retail trade,
the airline industry, and business services, while health services continued
to be the only major industry to post a notable job increase.
In the household survey, employment was about unchanged in February
following a large January decline, while the number of unemployed surged
443,000. The increase in unemployment in February largely reflected job
losses among adult men, whose unemployment rate rose 0.5 percentage point to
5.6 percent. In addition, job losers continued to account for a growing
proportion of the unemployed, and the number of individuals working part-
time for economic reasons increased sharply.
In recent weeks, initial claims for unemployment insurance (UI) have
moved above 500,000, and the number of unemployed workers covered by UI has
risen to 3.31 million. Shortages of administrative funds for the UI system
evidently have caused some problems in the functioning of the program.
Measures are being taken to add funds to the system; in the meantime, the
funding shortfalls have resulted in understaffing, and sometimes closings,
of state benefit offices. These problems do not appear to have had much
1. Although the UI program is administered by the states, and most
benefits are funded by state taxes, the administrative expenses of the
program are a federal responsibility. Under current budget procedures,
these administrative expenses--which total roughly $2 billion per year--are
funded by discretionary annual appropriations. This year's appropriation
was passed last fall--before the full extent of the recession and the rise
in joblessness became clear; as a result, the system is facing a substantial
shortage of administrative funds. The House has passed legislation that
would provide an additional $200 million in FY91, and the Administration
recently agreed to $150 million. The Administration also agreed to
designate the UI funds as "emergency spending" that would not have to be
offset by reductions in other discretionary programs.

effect on the filing of initial claims. However, delays in the processing
of claims have significantly lengthened the lag between the initial filing
and certification for benefits, thus slowing the payment of benefits.
Revised data indicate that productivity in the nonfarm business sector
grew at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1990, reflecting
large and nearly offsetting declines in output and hours worked. If these
preliminary data hold up, productivity performance actually will have turned
out to be somewhat better than typically occurs in the first quarter
following cyclical peaks, as employers have moved rapidly to trim payrolls
in light of falling demand. For 1990 as a whole, productivity was flat in
the nonfarm business sector, while manufacturing productivity increased
2.9 percent. In both sectors, productivity performance was better than in
1989, but the gains in 1990 were smaller than in any other year since 1981.
Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers were
essentially flat in January and February. Over the twelve months ended in
February, average hourly earnings increased 3.3 percent, about
1/2 percentage point below the pace recorded during the previous twelve
months. According to the Bureau of National Affairs, the median first-year
wage increase in collective bargaining contracts (including lump-sum
payments) has been running about 4 percent so far in 1991, down
1/4 percentage point from the pace recorded over 1990 as a whole. These
data provide further evidence of a slackening in wage inflation since the
unemployment rate began to rise.

Industrial Production
Industrial production continued to fall sharply during the first two
months of this year. In February, total output was down 0.8 percent; as a
result, it now seems likely that the decline in industrial production for
the first quarter as a whole will be at least as great as the 7 percent
annual rate drop recorded in the fourth quarter.
Reductions in output were widespread in February. Production of motor
vehicles and parts fell nearly 4 percent, as assemblies of cars and trucks
dropped back to 7-1/2 million units. Excluding motor vehicles, industrial
production fell 0.7 percent, about the same rate of decline as in December
and January. Output of nonauto consumer goods dropped further, mainly
because of decreases in appliances, furniture, and electricity for
residential use. In the capital goods sector, output of computers advanced
for a second month, but production of industrial machinery and farm
equipment continued to decline. Output of materials dropped again, led by
sharp decreases in output of durables, particularly steel.

On balance, output in industries for which we have weekly physical
product data picked up slightly in early March, largely because of stronger
2output of steel and energy-related items. Current schedules call for a
moderate rise in assemblies of motor vehicles this month, to an 8 million
unit annual rate; however, while auto production through mid-March tracked
close to the 5 million unit pace scheduled for the month as a whole, the
planned step-up in truck production had not materialized.
Assembly schedules call for motor vehicle production to increase to a
9 million unit annual rate in the second quarter. These plans incorporate
only a small rise in auto assemblies, to a 5-1/2 million unit rate, which
seems very conservative relative to the recent sales pace and the low level
of stocks, even adjusting for imports from Canada and Mexico. Reportedly,
the Big Three are basing their plans more closely than usual on dealer
orders, which apparently have yet to firm decisively.3  In contrast, truck
output plans seem a bit optimistic, given that sales have been sluggish and
inventories--although down appreciably over the past few months--remain on
the high side.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing slipped further in February to
78 percent--7 percent below the recent high in 1989. Operating rates have
fallen especially sharply since last September, after edging down over the
summer. Last month, operating rates continued to fall in most major
2. These industries include electricity generation, crude oil, motor
vehicles, steel, coal, and paper. They represent less than 20 percent of
the total index.
3. The slowing in sales of cars and light trucks since mid-1990 appears to
have affected the domestic Big Three and foreign nameplates about equally.
Since last July, the Big Three's share of total light vehicle sales has
averaged about 63 percent--not much different than the average during the
first half of 1990.

industries, with the largest declines at primary processing industries,
particularly steel and lumber.
Personal Income and Consumption
Household income remained weak in early 1991. Real disposable personal
income fell an estimated 0.9 percent at a monthly rate in January, largely
reflecting the cutbacks in employment and hours. In addition, the meager
rebound in aggregate hours worked in February, combined with flat average
hourly earnings, suggests that wages and salaries probably recovered little
last month. There were sizable, but offsetting, changes in other components
of personal income in January. Farm proprietors' income fell $16 billion at
an annual rate, as federal subsidy payments to farmers plummeted; at least
part of this decline is likely to be reversed in coming months. Meanwhile,
transfer income jumped nearly $17 billion as social security benefits and
otner government transfers were boosted by the annual COLAs.
Consumer spending at the turn of the year now appears to have been even
weaker than indicated previously, reflecting downward revisions to estimates
of December and January sales at the retail control group of stores--that
is, those excluding automotive dealers and building material and supply
stores. These data, which now show sizable declines in nominal terms in
both months, imply that real outlays for goods other than motor vehicles in
January were more than 1 percent below their fourth-quarter average. In
addition, expenditures for services other than electricity and natural gas
appear to have slowed; as estimated by BEA, the increase between September
and January was only 2 percent at an annual rate, down from more than
3 percent over the first nine months of 1990.

More recently, there have been hints that household spending may be
starting to firm. One such hint came in the advance retail sales report for
February, which showed that sales at the retail control grouping of stores
were little changed in nominal terms and were about flat in real terms as
well. Notably, sales at general merchandise, apparel, and furniture
outlets, a grouping that often is taken as an indicator of discretionary
purchases, jumped 2 percent in nominal terms last month, after posting
sizable declines over the preceding few months. Sales of automobiles and
light trucks in February rose to a 12 million unit annual rate from the
abysmally low January pace; sales of domestic models were about 9-1/2

II-15
According to preliminary readings from the Michigan survey, consumer
sentiment rebounded sharply in early March, after plunging to low levels
upon Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the commencement of the recession. Much
of the pickup in sentiment reflected consumers' more optimistic assessment
of prospective business conditions, both one year and five years ahead. In
addition, substantially more consumers thought it was a better time to buy
automobiles, household durables, and homes.
Our research suggests that measures of consumer sentiment probably have
some predictive ability for future changes in consumption, even controlling
for the information contained in other macroeconomic variables. However,
the informational advantage provided by the surveys in previous episodes
does not appear to have been great. Nonetheless, the extraordinarily large
changes in sentiment in the current period--seemingly out of proportion to
actual economic events--may make such historical comparisons somewhat
unreliable. As a result, although average historical relationships suggest
that the plunge in sentiment should not have been the most important factor
in generating the observed slowdown in household spending, we cannot rule
out a greater effect. Conceivably, given the widespread news reports about
consumer pessimism, firms may have lowered their sales expectations, and
hence reduced production and employment--making that pessimism almost a
self-fulfilling prophecy. We could see a reversal of that pattern now. Be
that as it may, we would not expect that the recent rebound in sentiment
would represent a sustainable stimulus to consumer spending unless it were
accompanied by a prompt resumption of growth in real income.

Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment appears to have been weak in early 1991. On
the equipment side, shipments of nondefense capital goods other than
aircraft--weighted to include only final business purchases--edged down in
January to a level 1-3/4 percent below their average in the fourth quarter.
And for nonresidential construction, both the current and leading indicators
point to a further sizable drop in building this quarter.
Outlays for office and computing equipment--a major component of
equipment--rose sharply in real terms in the fourth quarter after showing
little growth over the first three quarters of last year. In January,
nominal computer shipments were about 1 percent below the fourth-quarter
average; new orders for computers surged in January, but this increase
followed several months of weak readings. Shipments and orders for
equipment other than computers (and aircraft) both fell fractionally in
January, suggesting that outlays for these goods will remain on the
essentially flat path that has been evident for some time. Meanwhile,
business purchases of cars and trucks apparently were down, on balance, in
January and February.
Incoming orders for commercial aircraft slowed somewhat in January--
perhaps because of the effects of the weak economy, high fuel prices, and
fears of terrorism on the health of the airline industry. Nonetheless,
purchases of aircraft should continue to buoy equipment outlays well into
the future. None of Boeing's orders has been cancelled, although a few
bookings from domestic airlines have been deferred. Moreover, Boeing has an
order backlog of 1,800 planes, worth about $100 billion, which will take
several years to produce at current rates.

Real expenditures for nonresidential structures plummeted in the fourth
quarter, with declines of more than 20 percent at an annual rate for most
types of buildings. In January, construction put in place edged up from a
downward-revised December level but remained below its fourth-quarter
average. The outlook remains bleak for this sector. Contracts for total
construction have been dropping since late 1989. In addition, office
vacancy rates have remained close to 20 percent as absorption of office
space has fallen nearly as rapidly as new construction. 4 Furthermore,
tight lending standards remain in place for many types of commercial
construction.
The crisis in the Persian Gulf does not appear to have induced a large
pickup in drilling activity. Real outlays for drilling and mining increased
only slightly in the fourth quarter. More recently, footage drilled, a very
volatile series even on a quarterly basis, showed little net change between
last fall and January, and the Baker-Hughes rig count continued to hover
around 1,000 through the first week in March.
Inventory Investment
Manufacturing and trade inventories rose at an annual rate of
$41 billion in current-cost terms in January, after little net change in the
fourth quarter. In real terms, stocks had fallen $19 billion in the fourth
quarter, reflecting sizable liquidations at manufacturers and at auto
dealers. With sales and shipments down sharply around the turn of the year,
the ratio of inventories to sales in manufacturing and trade continued to
move up through January.
4. At the end of last year, the Coldwell-Banker office vacancy rate was
19.5 percent, the same as at the end of the third quarter still down
slightly from a year earlier.

Manufacturers made intermittent inventory adjustments through much of
1990, and liquidations became more widespread in the fourth quarter;
inventory reductions in real terms were reported by the machinery, aircraft,
and petroleum refining industries, and only the motor vehicles industry
reported a significant increase in stocks. Factory inventories were little
changed, on balance, in current-cost terms in January. However, by
January--despite efforts to hold the line on stock building--slumping sales
had pushed the inventory-to-shipments ratios for many manufacturers near the
high end of the range observed over the past year, especially for primary
metals and several nondurable goods industries.
In the trade sector, wholesale and non-auto retail inventories
increased in January at a $32 billion annual rate in current-cost terms
after a net increase of $19 billion during the fourth quarter, and stock-
sales ratios for these groups currently stand at the high end of the range
observed in recent years. For the broad range of retail establishments
carrying discretionary consumption goods (general merchandise, apparel, and
furniture and appliances), inventories rose substantially in January, when
sales fell 1 percent. The jump in sales at these stores in February likely
helped to ease the inventory overhang; even so, the stock-sales ratio
probably remained high by the standards of recent years. The inventory-
sales ratio for wholesalers also moved up sharply in January; stocks were
especially heavy at distributors of machinery and equipment, partly because
of the continued weakness in the construction industry.
Housing Markets
In February, permits and starts for single-family homes more than
retraced surprisingly sharp January declines. Additional evidence that

construction may have bottomed out came from builders surveyed by the
National Association of Homebuilders, who reported an unusually sharp
increase in shoppers and sales during the month.
Media reports and other anecdotal accounts add to the perception that a
recovery in housing demand and homebuilding may be commencing. To be sure,
distinguishing between seasonal and cyclical changes in housing activity is
particularly difficult as spring arrives; the normal seasonal rise from
February to March is about 25 percent for new home sales and about
45 percent for starts. Nonetheless, that demand could be firming is
plausible in light of the fact that lower mortgage rates and weak house
prices have made houses much more affordable. The Michigan Survey of
Consumer Sentiment, taken in early March, indicated a jump in the number of
consumers who thought it was a good time to buy a home, because of both
lower home prices and mortgage rates.
Meanwhile, multifamily construction continues dormant; starts in this
segment of the market were little changed in February and remain near their
lowest level since the 1950s. With vacancies still high and with investors
and lenders both on the sidelines, multifamily construction shows no signs
of near-term revival.
The Federal Government
The federal government accounts showed a small unified budget surplus
in January, reflecting a seasonal bulge in receipts and a temporary lapse in
funding for the RTC. Nevertheless, the $85 billion deficit that cumulated
through January is a record for the first four months of a fiscal year.
Nonwithheld income tax receipts in January, which are primarily

a bit below year-earlier collections. For the fiscal year to date, wage-
related tax collections--withheld income taxes and social security taxes--
rose about 7 percent. This increase exceeded the growth in aggregate
wages and salaries over this period by about 2-1/2 percentage points,
primarily because of the January 1990 hike in the social security tax rate.
Fiscal-year-to-date corporate tax receipts appear surprisingly strong, given
the performance of profits in 1989 and 1990, but may represent a catch-up
for low estimated tax payments in the first three quarters of last year.
Contributions from allies for Operation Desert Shield/Storm, deposited in
the Defense Cooperation Account, added $5.3 billion to receipts for the
months of October through January; the Defense Department reports that an
additional $8 billion was deposited in February. Substantial contributions
also are expected in March.
On the outlay side of the budget, congressional delays in authorizing
new funding halted most thrift resolution activity by the Resolution Trust
Corporation in January and February. Senate and House conferees have agreed
to a bill that provides an additional $30 billion of loss funds for the RTC;
the measure is scheduled for a final vote in both chambers before the Easter
recess. Defense spending for the fiscal year through January increased
7-1/2 percent from levels one year ago, because of expenses for Desert Storm
and shifts in the timing of military pay. Other spending increased
12 percent from year-earlier levels, partly because of continuing sharp
5. Withheld income taxes and payroll taxes are aggregated because precise
data are initially available only for total employer deposits. The withheld

II-30
increases in health expenditures and recession-related outlays for income
support.
The House and the Senate have approved similar versions of a
supplemental appropriation bill for Desert Storm that would provide
$43 billion of defense budget authority; this follows a $3 billion
supplemental passed last fall. Both versions specify that the spending is
to be funded first by foreign contributions. They also provide up to
$15 billion of Treasury funding--either to be used as working capital or to
make up the shortfall if the foreign contributions are less than
$43 billion. The $43 billion of budget authority is much smaller than the
Administration's request on February 22, which was based on the assumption
of a longer war. Funding for Operation Desert Storm and for items that the
Administration and the Congress label "emergencies" is not subject to the
spending limitations in the new budget procedures. 6
Real defense purchases are estimated to have increased at an 8 percent
annual rate in the fourth quarter, largely because of outlays related to the
Persian Gulf crisis; the spending was concentrated in petroleum and
ammunition purchases and military compensation. Nondefense purchases,
excluding CCC, were flat in the fourth quarter as a reduction in spending on
the census was offset by increases elsewhere.
6. Other spending legislation also is making its way through the
Congress. The Administration requested an FY91 supplemental appropriation
of $2.8 billion, about half for food stamps and the rest scattered through a
variety of programs. The House boosted the request to $4.1 billion,
primarily by adding money to defense (apart from direct Desert Storm
expenses) and aid to Israel. The ultimate effect on the deficit will depend
on whether the Congress and the President designate this spending as an
emergency measure, which would not require offsetting reductions elsewhere.

II-31
State and Local Governments
After trending up through much of last year, real outlays by state and
local governments for construction fell back in December and dropped sharply
in January. The decline was concentrated in spending on highways, which
dropped 23 percent between November and January. Construction spending is
very volatile month to month; nevertheless, the recent data may be signaling
the beginning of a period of constraint on building for some governments,
triggered by revenue shortfalls and budgetary pressures. Most governors
apparently will attempt to close their potential FY91 budget gaps primarily
with spending cuts rather than tax increases. In addition to reductions
in construction, many state governments have announced plans to cut
employment, furlough employees, and reduce aid to local governments. Growth
in outlays for day-to-day operations for the sector as a whole already has
slowed noticeably: Over the four quarters of 1990, real purchases for
nondurable goods and services rose 1.5 percent, the smallest increase since
1982.
With the rise in fiscal difficulties, a number of states with high
credit ratings have come under greater scrutiny by the credit rating
agencies. In particular, Standard and Poor's has placed six states rated AA
and AAA on "CreditWatch" for possible downgrading: California, Connecticut,
Maine, Michigan, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. Concern about the quality of
the states' debt centers on potential deficits in both the current fiscal
year, which ends on June 30 for all of these states, and in fiscal 1992. If
the governments of these states are not able to come up with plausible plans
to erase the deficits, downgradings could occur. Even without an actual

change in credit ratings, debt service costs for states and localities
experiencing erosion in their budgets likely will increase relative to what
they otherwise would have been, as capital markets adjust to the weakened
fiscal conditions and rates on new offerings rise.
Prices
Increases in consumer prices have slowed in recent months, but that
slowing is almost entirely the result of a retracing of the earlier runup in
energy prices. Excluding food and energy, the CPI posted sizable increases
in early 1991, reflecting hikes in excise taxes as well as an unusual
bunching of price increases at the beginning of the year. As a result, the
twelve-month percent change in the CPI excluding food and energy rose to
5.6 percent in February--1 percentage point higher than in the year-earlier
period. Even adjusting for the influence of these special factors, it is
hard to reconcile recent price behavior with the observed slowing in wage
inflation and the overall level of slack in the economy.
The CPI for energy declined about 2-1/2 percent in January and another
4 percent in February. Reflecting the sharply lower cost of crude oil,
retail gasoline prices fell 14 percent over the first two months of the
year. However, gasoline inventories have tightened, and private survey data
for early March suggest that prices will decline less sharply this month.
Elsewhere, prices of fuel oil and natural gas also posted large declines in
February, while electricity rates edged up.
Food prices at the consumer level jumped 0.6 percent in January, but
then fell 0.2 percent in February. About half of the January rise was
accounted for by a sharp increase in the prices of fruits and vegetables;
most of that increase was reversed in February. Large January advances in

the prices of some other foods--such as cereals and bakery products and
nonalcoholic beverages--probably reflected a bunching of price increases at
the start of the year, as prices of these items flattened out in February.
In total, the food price data of recent months suggest that the trend
in food price inflation has slowed. The twelve-month percentage change in
the CPI for food, which had stayed well above 5 percent over most of the
1989-90 period, recently has dropped back to just over 3 percent. A big
factor in this deceleration has been the sharp turnabout of dairy prices in
recent months, from a year-to-year rate of change of about 10 percent as
late as last September to a decline of about 1-1/4 percent as of February of
this year. A sustained increase in dairy production largely explains the
swing. In addition, increases in the prices of food away from home, the
category with by far the biggest weight of any category in the CPI for food,
have been quite moderate in recent months, and its year-to-year trend has
dropped a full percentage point since last summer, a meaningful deceleration
in a series that often displays considerable inertia. The twelve-month rate
of change in meat prices also has slowed of late, but only to the 5 percent
mark, as expansion of beef and pork production appears to be proceeding
rather cautiously at this point. Futures prices of farm commodities have
strengthened moderately since the last FOMC meeting, from what had been a
slightly declining trajectory overall to one that looks relatively flat over
1991 as a whole.
Heavy precipitation in California in recent weeks has provided a little
breathing room in that state's battle against drought, but the year still
promises to be one of tight water supplies. The impact of the drought on
agricultural production and food prices nationally will depend on several

factors: the degree to which California acreage might have to be
constrained or herds reduced; the degree to which yields might be cut on the
remaining acreage; and the degree to which producers in other states might
lift acreage in anticipation of reduced harvests in California. With regard
to field crops, a special USDA survey of prospective plantings, taken in the
last half of January, pointed to increased acreage in 1991 for most major
crops for the nation as a whole (wheat was the exception); although state
detail was not provided in the report, the anticipated increases in national
acreage did extend to field crops that are important in California, such as
cotton and rice. Additional USDA reports on prospective plantings will
become available in the last ten days of March, both for field crops and for
vegetables that are processed; a USDA report on the prospective second-
quarter acreage of fresh vegetables will be released in early April.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI jumped 0.8 percent in January and
another 0.7 percent in February. Higher federal excise taxes contributed to
large increases in both months in the prices of tobacco and alcoholic
beverages, while a 16 percent rise in postal rates boosted the index in
February. In addition, problems with seasonal adjustment probably
overstated somewhat the rise in inflation in the first two months of the
year. Apparel prices rose almost 3 percent in total over this period, as
the BLS began to sample spring merchandise earlier than was expected by the
seasonal factors; some reversal of these increases is likely in coming
months. Similarly, changes in BLS' method of pricing lodging while out of
town caused this subindex to surge, adding as much as 0.3 percentage point
to the rise in the overall CPI over the past year.

II-40
Nonetheless, even outside of these areas, the acceleration in prices
appears to have been fairly widespread. Prices of new cars were up
1.3 percent in January and another 0.5 percent in February, reflecting the
continued introduction into the CPI sample of 1991 models and some scaling
back of incentive programs. Prices of light trucks rose a similar amount
despite an extensive supply of those vehicles. In addition to motor
vehicles, price increases have picked up for a variety of public services,
and airfares have continued to rise despite some moderation in jet fuel
costs.
At the producer level, the PPI for finished goods less food and energy
increased 0.5 percent in January and 0.4 percent in February. Increases in
motor vehicle prices were large in both months, while prices of alcoholic
beverages jumped sharply in January before giving back some of the increase
in February. Prices of intermediate materials (nonfood, non-energy) were
little changed in February for the third consecutive month as declines--
notably for nonferrous metals and some petroleum-based materials--about
offset increases for most of the more processed materials. Price changes
for crude nonfood materials less energy were mixed and, on average,
relatively small after substantial declines over the last four months of
1990.
The prices of some commodities--notably grains and precious metals--
jumped sharply after the end of hostilities in the Middle East. But the
increases did not become widespread and, in some cases, already have been
partly reversed. These patterns of price change have showed through most
clearly in the CRB futures index, a measure in which food commodities and
precious metals are heavily weighted. In contrast, both the CRB spot index

for industrials and the Journal of Commerce index of industrial metals
prices have moved in narrow ranges for more than a month, as price movements
in spot markets for industrial materials have been mixed.
Leading Indicators of Expansion
The composite index of leading economic indicators, which declined more
moderately on average in December and January, appears likely to record an
increase in February. The lead time for this measure has been erratic in
the past seven business cycles; turns in the LEI precede the reference cycle
trough by an average of about 4-1/2 months, but with a standard deviation of
almost four months.
The lead times of the individual LEI components vary considerably in
their length and reliability. The table lists the mean lead times at
troughs and the associated standard deviations. Among those indicators with
significant lead times, several turned upward awhile ago. Stock prices
reached a low point in October and have posted strong gains recently; given
its lead time of almost five months, and the relatively small standard
deviation, the stock index would appear to be providing a strong signal of
an imminent upturn in the economy. Consumer expectations turned up in
November, suggesting, again with comparatively high reliability, that the
business cycle trough is at hand. In contrast, the real money stock and
building permits turned up only last month, which would suggest a cyclical
turn in the second quarter. One other indicator that is both available and
characterized by a relatively low standard deviation, sensitive material
prices, has yet to display a clear trough.
Given the relatively short or irregular lead times of the other six
components of the LEI, their recent behavior probably tells us little about

II-43
the timing of the prospective cyclical trough. However, the fact that the
average workweek, (inverted) initial claims, and vendor performance all
continued to fall through February tends to reinforce the sense that the
turning point probably has not yet been reached, but it does not by any
means rule out the possibility that the trough could occur shortly.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The System eased pressures on reserve positions slightly further in
early March, just after the release of the weak February job report, but the
quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate turned out to be a comparatively
minor factor in financial market developments during the intermeeting
period. The more powerful forces were the hopes of stronger economic
performance in the wake of the allied military success in the Gulf,
indications of some firming in consumer demand and housing activity, and
disappointingly large increases in the "core" components of the February PPI
and CPI.
Most short-term market rates are marginally lower now than at the time
of the February FOMC meeting, but at the long end of the maturity spectrum
Treasury bond yields are up around 40 basis points. Reflecting the
perceived reduction in default risks, high-grade corporate bond yields are
little changed and junk bond rates have fallen more than 150 basis points.
The stock market, too, has benefited from the better economic outlook; after
backing off in the past few days from what were record highs for many
popular indexes, share prices are still up about 2 to 5 percent over the
intermeeting period. Gains in private securities of bank holding companies
prompted a number of institutions to tap the markets for new debt and equity
capital.
The more upbeat assessment of prospective credit risks contrasts with
continued signs of financial distress. Most measures of delinquencies and
charge-offs of loans to households and businesses increased in the fourth
quarter, and there has been little falloff in announcements of fiscal
III-1

III-2
difficulties at state and local governments. Downgradings of bonds remain
frequent, and some of the renewed enthusiasm for junk bonds relates to the
prospect of gaining more valuable equity positions in restructurings of
overleveraged and otherwise financially distressed companies.
Aggregate borrowing by nonfinancial firms appears to have risen in the
past couple of months as offerings of investment-grade bonds have more than
offset the weakness in bank loans and commercial paper; many corporations
apparently have been anxious to strengthen balance sheets and unwilling to
bet on a significant decline soon in long-term interest rates. A dip in
tax-exempt interest rates in early February led to a rejuvenation in long-
term municipal debt issuance; short-term borrowing also has picked up, to
cover budgetary shortfalls. Evidence on household borrowing is limited and
mixed. Consumer credit was decidedly weak as spending collapsed around
year-end, but bank data hint at an upturn in February. In the mortgage
market, trade reports point to a renewed interest in home loans, especially
refinancings, in February.
Monetary expansion picked up in February, and the latest data indicate
that the stronger growth trend has extended into this month. M2 has moved
well within its annual growth cone, the bulk of the recent acceleration
reflecting a rise in liquid retail deposits; although this may simply be a
lagged adjustment to the sizable decline in opportunity costs since last
summer, there are signs, too, that the decline in public confidence may be
abating. M3 growth was pushed to double digits in February on the continued
strength of inflows to institution-only MMMFs and a surge in large time
deposits at foreign branches and agencies. Bank credit posted a sizable
gain in February, although business loans remained weak.

III-3
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 accelerated to an 8-1/2 percent annual rate of growth in February,
its most robust performance in a year. The turnaround owed somewhat to a
rebound in demand deposits but primarily reflected a surge in liquid retail
deposits--OCDs and savings plus MMDAs. The opportunity cost of holding
these deposits had been falling since early last summer but with little
apparent impact on this component of M2 until recently (chart). Inflows to
liquid deposits had perhaps been restrained by concerns of households about
the soundness of the depository system, particularly in view of bank and

thrift institution crises in New England. Indeed, the Boston District
experienced substantial outflows in December and January. More recently,
however, retail deposits have rebounded, especially in New England, and
household purchases of Treasury securities, as indicated by the volume of
noncompetitive tenders, fell off sharply in February. The rise in retail
deposits apparently did not come at the expense of stock and bond funds,
however, inflows into which reportedly continued at a strong pace in
February.
Growth of currency and money market mutual funds slowed in February,
although continuing at a brisk pace. Currency shipments to the Middle East
have slowed considerably in recent weeks from their frenetic January pace,
but shipments to other foreign countries have continued unabated. M2-type
MMMFs continued to grow strongly as well, bolstered by their favorable
yields relative to other market instruments. Small time deposits, in
contrast, remain in the doldrums, as depositories have lowered rates on
retail CDs much more quickly than on other deposits.
M3 jumped 10-1/2 percent in February, putting this aggregate at the
upper bound of its annual growth cone. In addition to the revival of M2
growth, M3 was driven by continued strength in institution-only MMMFs and in
large time deposits.
Large time deposits have expanded at double-digit rates in the past two
months after contracting for much of last year. This recent strength has
been accounted for entirely at branches and agencies of foreign banks and
reflects their substitution away from other liabilities following the
December change in reserve requirements. Previously, foreign branches and
agencies had been required to hold reserves against all nonpersonal time

deposits, but only against those net Eurodollar borrowings that exceeded
8 percent of their capital, as measured by their assets. Owing to this
exclusion, the reserve requirement on net Eurodollar borrowing had not been
binding on many branches and agencies. For these institutions, therefore,
the change in reserve requirements amounted to a reduction in the relative
cost of funding with large time deposits. In addition, representatives of
several foreign branches indicate that they have turned to large time
deposits as a vehicle for locking in funds over the quarter-end rather than
use shorter-term liabilities such as federal funds.
Bank credit expanded at a 6-1/4 percent annual rate in February, its
strongest showing since last summer. Growth of security holdings rose,
mainly U.S. government securities at large domestic banks. The loan
categories also strengthened. Consumer loans rebounded smartly following a
large decline in January; adjusted for securitizations, such loans increased
at a 9 percent annual rate last month, after no change in January. Real
estate loans also increased briskly in February, despite some slowing in
home equity lending; about half of the growth, however, was due to banks'
acquisition of loans from thrift institutions. Business loans grew
slightly last month, but some of the increase owed to a foreign bank's
transfer of loans from its Nassau branch to its U.S. branches.
Business loan growth may have been restrained to a degree by the
failure of some loan rates to decline in tandem with market rates:
According to the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending, the average spread of
prime-based loans over the federal funds rate widened considerably further
between November and February. Banks apparently have continued to tighten
lending standards for C&I and commercial real estate loans. According to

the March Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices,
about one-half the number of banks that had reported tightening in the
preceding survey, covering the three months ending in late January,
indicated further tightening in the six weeks ending in mid-March. For
consumer lending, however, banks on balance evidenced no further tightening
in the most recent survey.
Through the end of last year, charge-off and delinquency rates on real
estate and consumer loans at commercial banks continued to rise (chart).
Business loan delinquencies also rose further, while charge-offs remained
elevated. Regionally, loan problems at banks were spread over most
Districts, although the greatest concentration continues to be in the
Northeast and Texas.
Nonfinancial Business Finance
The weakness in business loans in February was accompanied by a decline
in commercial paper and at least partially reflected a desire by firms to
shift to longer-term financing. Bond issuance has been heavy in recent
weeks, apparently because many corporate treasurers believed that long-term
rates were unlikely to fall much further. Issues with maturities longer
than ten years have accounted for a large share of total nonfinancial
offerings.
The commercial paper market was largely unaffected by restrictions
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission on taxable money funds'
holdings of so-called second-tier securities, partly because the
restrictions had been long anticipated. Beginning June 1, 1991, a taxable
money fund can hold no more than 5 percent of its assets in second-tier
securities--generally those carrying the second-highest rating of the credit

rating agencies--and no more than one percent of its assets in any single
second-tier company. The SEC imposed these limits out of concern for the
safety of money funds in view of the defaults on commercial paper over the
past two years. While affecting some funds, the new rule is not likely to
have much impact on the industry in the aggregate, as the SEC estimated that
money funds held only about $6 billion of second-tier commercial paper at
the end of 1990--roughly 1-1/2 percent of the total assets of money funds.
Yield spreads in the corporate sector have narrowed across the board,
suggesting that investors' concerns about credit quality have diminished in
recent weeks. Within the investment-grade sector, spreads between
intermediate-term corporate bonds and Treasury issues have been reduced 5 to
10 basis points from their early January highs, while spreads for longer-
term bonds have narrowed as much as 50 basis points. Industrial bonds have
outperformed utility bonds, and medium-grade bonds rated A and BBB have
rallied more than higher-rated bonds, restoring the alignment of last
summer.
The improvement of credit quality spreads was especially evident in the
junk bond market, as spreads relative to Treasuries narrowed nearly 200
basis points; nonetheless, these spreads, at roughly 950 basis points, are
still very high. Strong inflows to high-yield mutual funds in recent weeks
reportedly have helped fuel the improvement. In spite of the rally,
issuance of new junk bonds has remained light, and a pickup in volume is not
likely as long as yield spreads remain so wide and LBO activity subdued.
1. A second-tier security is one that has received no rating lower than
the second-highest and no more than one top rating.

III-12
The recent rally in the junk bond market differs from last spring's
rally in that bonds rated B and CCC have recently outperformed the stronger
BB-rated credits--as the lower-rated bonds have benefitted most from several
de-leveraging initiatives. For example, RJR-Nabisco successfully completed
an equity-for-debt tender offer that reduced its leverage ratio to 4:1,
compared with 25:1 when the buyout was completed two years ago. A number of
other highly leveraged companies have announced or are considering similar
exchange offers or buybacks. In addition, bond prices of some highly
leveraged companies, surged in response to merger offers by investment-grade
companies. These merger offers typically are contingent on bondholders'
agreeing to receive less than par value for their bonds but more than the
deeply discounted market prices.
Exchange and restructuring proposals are expected to be numerous in
1991. Last year thirty-one exchange offers (involving $11.7 billion of
high-yield securities) and twenty-three tender offers (amounting to $4.3
billion) were announced. Most of the exchange offers involved replacing
outstanding debt with combinations of cash, common stock, and new debt
securities that had lower, pay-in-kind, or deferred interest payments.
Fifteen exchange offers were completed during the year, including two that
had been announced in 1989. Overleveraged and distressed situations were
the cause of most of the exchange proposals.
New high-yield securities issued through exchange offers were down
markedly last year. This reduction primarily reflects the difficulties that
issuers face when negotiating with increasingly demanding bondholders.
Several transactions, such as Southland's, were terminated because holders
did not tender the minimum amounts needed for the offers to be successful,

III-13
forcing some companies into bankruptcy under chapter 11. More recently, a
growing number of issuers are seeking bondholder approval of prepackaged
bankruptcy reorganization plans concurrent with distressed exchange offers.
Prepackaged bankruptcies usually require the approval of only two-thirds of
bondholders, compared with a typical 90 to 95 percent for exchange/tender
offers.
Stock prices have risen about 3 percent on average since early
February; the S&P 500, NYSE composite, and Wilshire indexes posted record
highs during the intermeeting period before dropping back more recently. In
response to price gains, gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations
rose in February but only to a quite moderate $1 billion; offerings in March
have been a bit stronger than in February. The pace of net equity
retirements in the first quarter of 1991 is expected to be noticeably slower
than that of the previous quarter, with AT&T's proposed acquisition of NCR
unlikely before the end of March.
Financial Firms
In the market for subordinated bank debt, yield spreads over Treasuries
have narrowed about 100 basis points on average for regional banks since
January with even greater improvements posted by the weaker money center
banks. In response to lower rates, nine banking firms raised $1.7 billion
in subordinated debt between late January and mid-March, compared with $1.4
billion for all of 1990. Bank borrowing in the unsecured senior note market
also has rebounded, as more than $550 million came to market in late
February and early March. Furthermore, borrowing in the medium-term note
market appears to have been strong of late.

III-14
Equity issuance by banking firms also has picked up in recent weeks.
New offerings included common stock issues by Norwest and KeyCorp and
preferred stock offerings by Barnett and Security Pacific. In the private
placement market, Citicorp raised $1.19 billion with two offerings of
convertible preferred stock; roughly half was purchased by institutional
investors under SEC rule 144a, which allows free trading of privately placed
securities among institutional investors that have at least $100 million in
investment assets.
Issuance of asset-backed securities rebounded in February and continued
strong in March. During the final five months of 1990, investor resistance
to heavy supply and concern about rising delinquencies and charge-offs
caused a 50 to 75 basis point wideningin the spreads on AAA-rated
securities backed by credit card receivables and auto loans. Since the last
FOMC, however, spreads have narrowed about 20 basis points.
Recent bond offerings by other financial firms included two issues by
MBIA, Inc., the parent company of the largest municipal bond insurer. The
spreads on MBIA issues were fairly wide relative to comparable corporate
rates and reportedly were more indicative of investors' lack of familiarity
with MBIA than of concern about the health of the firm, whose debt is rated
Aa2/AA+.
Reported junk bond holdings of insurance companies may show a
substantial increase due to a reclassification under the new rating system
that was recently adopted by the National Association of Insurance
Companies. Indeed, the reclassification may largely explain why the junk
bond holdings at First Executive's two insurance units increased from 55

III-15
percent of their total bond holding at year-end 1989 to 79 percent at year-
end 1990. The new rating system also requires companies to maintain larger
reserves against lower-rated bonds, leading to reports that some insurance
companies are exploring ways to restructure their portfolios. For example,
insurance companies may be able to reduce such reserves by repackaging their
junk bond holdings in a collateralized bond structure. Such a repackaging
also would reduce the impact of a proposed 20 percent cap on junk bond
holdings, which already have been imposed by some state regulators.
Treasury and Sponsored-Agency Financing
The federal deficit is likely to be substantially smaller in the first
quarter of 1991 than projected at the time of the last Greenbook. The main
reason is the unexpectedly slow pace of RTC resolutions and larger foreign
contributions to the funding of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. Given
the reduced borrowing requirement, the Treasury has slashed the gross sizes
of its bill auctions. Since the beginning of February, weekly bill auctions
have been cut from $20 billion to $16 billion, and the one-year bill
auctions have been reduced by $1 billion. In the coupon sector, only the
gross size of the two-year note auction has been reduced, while the
thirty-year bond auction was increased marginally.
The slowing in RTC activity reflects, in part, the failure of the
Congress to enact additional funding, although the Congress is expected to
pass a bill reconciled by a conference committee in the near future. The
Adminstration requested an additional $30 billion for the RTC loss fund for
the remainder of the fiscal year. Net RTC spending in the first quarter
through mid-March totaled about $14 billion--$8 billion in loss funds and $6

billion in working capital. For the current fiscal year as a whole,
spending has totaled $24 billion, of which $11 billion was to cover losses.
Thus far, the RTC has made little progress in selling assets. Of the
352 thrifts resolved through year-end 1990, 266 were deposit payouts, of
which 51 resulted in no transfer of assets to the private sector; in the
remaining 215 resolutions, less than half of the assets were transferred to
the acquiring institutions. The RTC has sold only $45 billion of the $190
billion of assets that have been added to the RTC balance sheet since August
1989; half of the assets sold were mortgages and a third were securities.
Another sign of the difficult task facing the RTC is the drop in premiums
for deposits it has sold. Last fall, premiums ranged from 3 percent to 6
percent; more recent sales have had premiums of less than 1 percent.
In the market for the debt of government-sponsored enterprises, spreads
on new issues remained narrow in February and March. The Federal National
Mortgage Association continued to borrow heavily in January; since September
its outstanding debt has risen 6 percent, to $126 billion. Borrowing by
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation also was strong in the fourth
quarter. Stock prices for Fannie are about unchanged while those for
Freddie are roughly 15 percent above their levels at the time of the
February FOMC meeting.
The Administration's FY92 federal budget document contains an analysis
of government-sponsored enterprises that focuses primarily on interest-rate
and credit risk. The analysis concludes that the direct risk to taxpayers
from the implicit guarantee "is not large." However, the report cites
specific weaknesses regarding the insurance fund of the Farm Credit System.

III-18
In addition, it questions the viability of the FHLB System in light of its
shrinking membership and FIRREA-mandated assessments.
Municipal Securities
Issuance of long-term tax-exempt securities jumped in February as state
and local governments took advantage of reduced rates; yields dropped to
their lowest levels in eighteen months early in the intermeeting period
before backing up. Some of last month's offerings had originally been
slated for January but were delayed in hopes of lower rates. Refunding
issuance remained low in February, however, as many of the outstanding
issues with coupon rates higher than current bond yields have previously
been refunded.
Short-term issuance rose to approximately $2 billion in February and
likely will be boosted further in coming months, as states and
municipalities contend with continuing budget difficulties. Connecticut is
likely to issue approximately $700 million in notes this spring to cover its
fiscal 1991 shortfall. California is preparing to issue a record $5 billion
in revenue anticipation notes, and New York State will enter the note market
with a $3.9 billion issue in June.
Moody's Investors Service lowered New York City's rating from A to Baal
in February, affecting about $16.5 billion in debt. The credit agency
indicated that the city's fiscal 1992 financial plan did not represent a
reasonable program to achieve a balanced budget. At about the same time,
the New York State Financial Control Board, created in the mid-1970s to
oversee the city's finances during that fiscal crisis, reported that New
York City's four-year financial plan will result in the spending of
$10.7 billion more than revenues will permit over the period. According to

the report, the prospective budget deficits would increase debt service
costs from 12 percent of tax revenue to 20 percent by the end of the plan.
Deficits of the size predicted would permit the board to take control of the
city's finances.
Although the number of states and municipalities facing budgetary
deficits remains large, the pace of rating downgradings has slowed so far in
1991. A total of 59 state and local government units have been downgraded
through mid-March, compared with an average of 120 per quarter in 1990.
Downgradings in 1991 have continued to exceed upgradings by a sizable
margin, but by less than in 1990.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage lending appears to have remained weak in the first quarter,
although it may have begun to pick up recently, sparked by declines in

III-21
mortgage rates. Commitment rates on both FRMs and ARMs generally have
fallen in recent months, both in absolute terms and relative to
comparable-duration Treasuries (chart). Contract rates on conventional FRMs
dropped as much as 30 basis points in mid-February from their levels at the
time of the February FOMC meeting, but have since moved back up.
In the ARM sector, the average commitment rate on loans indexed to the
Treasury one-year constant maturity yield declined about 30 basis points
through mid-March, reducing the spread over the index by a comparable
amount. Nonetheless, the spread remains quite wide by the standards of
recent years as ARM lenders have been much less aggressive in pricing loans.
Moreover, in recent months, fully indexed ARM rates (that is, the rate in
effect after the initial period) for new loans have exceeded rates on
comparable FRMs by as much as 1-1/4 percentage points, while in late 1987
and early 1988 fully indexed ARM rates were well below rates on FRMs. The
ARM share of new loans closed has averaged about 30 percent recently, less
than half the portion in 1987 and 1988.
Total mortgage debt is estimated to have grown at an annual rate of
only 4 percent in the fourth quarter, the slowest pace since 1982. Credit
expansion was concentrated in single-family loans, where growth was little
changed from the third-quarter rate. As noted above, bank real estate
loans, which were flat in January, rose in February--even after adjusting
for aquisitions from thrift institutions. Moreover, trade reports note a
marked surge in refinancing volume that has boosted recent loan
originations. Refinancing activity apparently has accounted for as much as
30 to 40 percent of total loan applications at some lenders, close to the
record levels registered during the refinancing wave of 1986-87. A pickup

III-22
in refinancing volume has been widely anticipated, given the decline in
recent months in contract rates on FRMs to an average near 9-1/2 percent.
Estimates suggest that about 16 percent of FRM debt outstanding at year-end
1989 carried rates in excess of 11 percent, making many of them candidates
for refinancing. Moreover, borrowers who initially received ARM teaser
rates well below the costs of fixed-rate credit and whose discount period
has expired now have a financial incentive to refinance.

securities. The decline in January likely reflected uncertainty associated
with the Persian Gulf war and is thought to have been temporary.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit contracted in January for the second
consecutive month, a development that usually occurs only during periods of
3recession. The contraction was marginal in December but deepened to a
4 percent annual rate in January, reflecting weakness in auto credit and the
"all other" component, of which unsecured personal loans make up the largest
share. Revolving credit, which had contracted sharply in December, bounced
back in January, although its growth remains notably weak relative to much
of last year.
The sharp slowing in revolving credit growth appears to be due more to
damped demand than to curtailment of the supply of credit. Although
delinquency rates have been rising on credit cards (the main element of
revolving credit), that form of credit remains one of the most profitable
for banks, which are the dominant issuers of credit cards. There are no
indications that banks are generally imposing significantly tougher criteria
for opening new accounts. (Although First Chicago made headlines in late
February by cancelling cards or reducing credit limits for certain accounts
in the Northeast, this restrictive action against existing cardholders
appears to be the exception among major issuers.) On the demand side,
3. Consumer installment credit declined in three consecutive months from
December 1986 through February 1987, but part of that contraction was
attributable to large paydowns of consumer debts through exercise of home
equity lines of credit induced by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The last
previous period of sustained decline in consumer credit occurred in April
through July 1980, a period that encompassed both a recession and the Carter
Administration's credit controls program. The cumulative decline for those
four months was 8-1/2 percent at an annual rate.

retail sales have been sluggish, and consumer surveys suggest caution on the
part of households in borrowing. Nonetheless, some major issuers have noted
a pickup in credit card usage in recent weeks.
As noted, delinquency rates on bank credit cards have been rising in
recent months. In the fourth quarter of 1990, as reported by the American
Bankers Association (ABA), credit card accounts with payments past-due for
thirty days or more rose to 2-3/4 percent of total accounts, up
1/4 percentage point from the preceding quarter and 2/3 percentage point
over the course of the year. Some other delinquency measures, however, have
shown little or no deterioration recently. The ABA's average delinquency
rate for several types of closed-end consumer loans was virtually unchanged
in the fourth quarter. At approximately 2-1/2 percent for both the year and
the fourth quarter, this rate is near the upper end of its range for the
past twenty years.
On home mortgages, delinquencies declined in the fourth quarter,
according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). The proportion of
loans past due 60 days or more dropped back 0.05 percentage points to
1-1/2 percent after a fairly sharp rise in the third quarter. Despite the
earlier increase, the delinquency rate at year-end 1990 was around the
lowest levels of the past ten years. The downtrend in the MBA's series for
home mortgages contrasts with an ongoing rise in delinquencies on real
estate loans taken from bank call reports. In addition to home mortgages,
however, the latter encompass commercial mortgages and construction loans,
for which repayment problems have been more severe. Delinquency rates also
rose in the fourth quarter on mortgage loans at life insurance companies;

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In January, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit increased slightly to
$7.0 billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis) from a revised deficit in
December of $6.3 billion. Exports increased 3-1/2 percent in January with
most of the increase in automotive products (from a low December level) and
in industrial supplies. The level of exports in January was nearly 1
percent higher than the monthly average for the fourth quarter. Imports
rose 5 percent in January, with nearly all of the increase in automotive
products (also from a low level) and non-oil industrial supplies. The value
of oil imports rose only slightly as a decline in price of $3 per barrel was
more than offset by a 15 percent increase in quantity imported; the quantity
of oil imported in January was at about a 3 percent higher rate than the
fourth-quarter average.

(largely fuels and chemicals). (See the table on the next page.) The
growth rate of exports of capital goods and consumer goods was also strong
in the fourth quarter, but exports of automotive products declined. Over
the entire year, the quantity of exports expanded 9 percent (Q4/Q4), with
sharp rates of increase recorded for industrial supplies, capital goods, and
consumer goods. By area, the largest increase in value was to Western
Europe, which accounts for 30 percent of nonagricultural exports. There was
also a sharp increase in nonagricultural exports to Mexico, particularly
automotive parts for use by Ford, GM, and Chrysler in their Mexican plants.
Nonagricultural exports to Canada, which account for nearly one-quarter of
U.S. shipments, rose at a much slower rate reflecting the sagging Canadian
economy. Agricultural exports in the fourth quarter were 4 percent less

than in the third quarter, with much of the decrease attributable to prices
(especially for wheat).
In the fourth quarter, the quantity of non-oil imports was about
the same as in the third quarter; a sharp decline in imported automotive
products was largely offset by an increase in imported computers and parts.
There were only small changes in other trade categories. Prices of non-oil
imports rose nearly 6 percent AR in the fourth quarter, led by increases in
prices of imported automotive products and capital goods.
The value of imported oil rose sharply at the latter part of 1990
despite a drop in the quantity imported by more than 15 percent in the

weaker U.S. economic activity, mild weather, and a slowdown in refinery runs
in order to perform maintenance. As measured by the Department of Energy,
the quantity imported continued to be held down in January and February.
Price of Oil
Even though prices of oil began to decline in November, the price of
imported oil in January was still about 50 percent higher than the lows
recorded in June and July. Developments in spot markets suggest that import
prices in February were about $20. (BLS data for February will be released
on March 28.)

OPEC agreed at the March 11-12 meeting of its Price Monitoring
Committee to hold production in the second quarter of 1991 to 22.3 million
barrels per day and affirmed its commitment to a $21 per barrel reference
(export) price. Announcement of the accord moved West Texas prices up
slightly to just over $20 per barrel, which is consistent with an OPEC
export price of roughly $18 per barrel.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
BLS prices of non-oil imports were about the same in January as in
December and about 1/2 percent above the fourth-quarter average. (See the
table on the next page.) Except for sharp increases in prices of
agricultural products and chemicals, prices of imported goods showed only
small changes from December levels. In the fourth quarter, prices of non-
oil imports rose at an annual rate of 6 percent, after having shown only
small increases earlier in the year; part of the rise was related to the
depreciation of the dollar earlier in the year. The strongest rises were
for imported capital goods and consumer durables. There were also increases
in the prices of imported automotive products (new model year as well as the
dollar's depreciation), and petroleum-related goods. Smaller increases were
recorded for prices of imported consumer nondurables, foods, and industrial
supplies (increases for fuels more than offset price declines for other
supplies and materials).
Prices of nonagricultural exports in January were little changed on
average from levels recorded in December, as declines in prices of exported
fuels, paper, and building materials were offset by increases in prices of
such exported goods as agricultural machinery, telecommunications equipment,
textiles, and steelmaking materials. In the fourth quarter, nonagricultural
export prices rose at an annual rate of 8 percent. Most of that increase
was associated with rising prices of exported fuels and other industrial

supplies (especially petrochemicals). Price increases for exported capital
goods, automotive products, and consumer goods were in the 2 to 4 percent
annual rate range in the fourth quarter. Prices of agricultural exports
moved up in January despite continued declines in wheat and other grains.
In the fourth quarter, agricultural export prices dropped for the sixth time
in the last seven quarters, led by declining prices of grain, especially
wheat.
U.S. Current Account through 1990-04
The U.S. current account deficit has been and will continue to be
buffeted by events in the Middle East. The deficit was $111 billion (SAAR)
in the fourth quarter, $5 billion (AR) larger than in the revised third
quarter. (See the table on the next page.) For the year the deficit was
$99 billion, the smallest deficit recorded since 1984.
In the fourth quarter, a narrowing of the merchandise trade deficit,
increases in net investment income receipts, and continuing increases in net
receipts from other service transactions (especially receipts from
foreigners traveling in the United States), were more than offset by larger
net military payments and a jump in unilateral transfers.
Unilateral transfers in 1990-Q4 were affected by several special
transactions that were partly offsetting. These included (1) receipt by the
U.S. government of $4.3 billion (not annual rate) in cash contributions from
the coalition partners in Operation Desert Shield to help defray the costs
of operations in the Persian Gulf, (2) grants by the U.S. government of $7
billion (not annual rate) to the Government of Egypt in debt forgiveness,
essentially allowing Egypt to repay principal ($5 billion) and interest ($2
billion) owed to the U.S. government, and (3) grants to Israel of $2.9
billion (not annual rate) from regular Congressional appropriations.

r--revised p--preliminary
Military exports and imports were both affected in the fourth quarter
by Operation Desert Shield. Transfers under U.S. military agency sales
contracts (exports) were boosted by accelerated sales of equipment to
coalition countries in the Middle East. There were also increased direct
defense expenditures abroad in support of operations in the Persian Gulf.
On balance, expenditures rose more than sales.
Much of the increase in net investment income receipts in the fourth
quarter was attributable to U.S. government receipts, which included an
accounting entry for the implicit receipt of interest on the Egyptian debt
(described above under unilateral transfers).
U.S. International Financial Transactions
The recently released BOP data for the fourth quarter did nothing to
reduce or explain the unprecedented statistical discrepacy registered for
the first three quarters of 1990. (See line 10 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table.) As anticipated, the fourth quarter

IV-9
figure was large -- $19.4 billion -- leading to a preliminary statistical
discrepancy for the year of $73 billion. This figure is more than twice as
large as the previous high of $3' billion observed in 1982. As discussed in
earlier Greenbooks, net currency shipments by banks contributed
approximately $15 billion to the increase in the discrepancy, but the major
part is, at present, unexplained. Currency movements have continued at a
high rate in 1991: net outflows were $2.9 and $1.4 billion, respectively, in
January and February.
For the fourth quarter, the only substantial recorded capital inflow
was the increase in foreign official reserve assets held in the United
States (line 4). Inflows of $20.1 billion in the quarter brought the annual
total to $31.4 billion. European countries, particularly Spain,
Switzerland, and Germany, accounted for almost 3/4 of the increase; Mexico
and Venezuela accounted for much of the remainder.
For the year, the net inflows in official capital and banking were to
a large extent offset by large net outflows related to private portfolio
capital (lines 2 and 3) and moderate net outflows associated with direct
investment (lines 6 and 7). With respect to portfolio capital, U.S.
residents continued large net purchases of foreign securities in the fourth
quarter, leading to a record annual outflow (line 2c). A large part of the
outflow was the result of a large increase in the issuance of foreign bonds
in the U.S. market. Foreigners sold $13.9 billion net of U.S. stocks for
the year (line 2b). Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury obligations'and U.S.
corporate bonds did increase, but by amounts that were not large
historically (lines 2a and 3).
Unlike 1989, when there was a net direct investment inflow of $41
billion (lines 6 and 7), in 1990 a net outflow of just over $10 billion
emerged. Direct investment outflows reached a new annual high of $36.4

billion; this was primarily the result of high levels of acquisitions and
capital spending by existing foreign affiliates of U.S. companies.
Preliminary estimates of capital spending plans for 1991 suggest continued
large direct investment outflows this year.
Direct investment inflows, on the other hand, were very low in the
fourth quarter and fell over 60 percent for the year to $26 billion (line
7). Preliminary data for the value of acquisitions by foreign direct
investors in the United States show a much smaller fall-off in 1990 of
approximately 25 percent. The implication is that direct investors are
still acquiring U.S. assets at a rapid rate, but that, because of favorable
interest rates, a much larger percentage of this expansion is being financed
in the United States.
Data for January show significant recorded capital inflows in banking,
foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury obligations, and official capital
(lines 1, 3 and 4). Preliminary data from the FRBNY indicate a small
decrease in February for foreign official reserves held in the United
States, more than accounted for by Germany's $2 billion payment for
Operation Desert Storm. Additional substantial contributions by other
governments to cover the costs of Operation Desert Storm are likely to be
reflected in declines in official reserves in coming months. Data on
banking flows in February, reported on a monthly average basis in the
International Banking Data table, show a resumption of significant capital
outflows (line 1). The reduction in net borrowing by agencies and branches
of foreign banks, shown in line 1b, coincided with strong growth of large
time deposits at their U.S. offices.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign-exchange value of the dollar, in terms of
the other G-10 currencies, has risen 11 percent since the February 6 FOMC
meeting, as shown in the accompanying chart. The dollar was supported by
euphoria over the successful end of the Persian Gulf war and by expectations
that an upturn in consumer confidence will help the U.S. economy rebound.
These changed expectations, coupled with perceptions of some weakening of
growth abroad, led the market to expect movements in relative interest
differentials more favorable to the dollar. In Germany, proposed tax
increases were seen as reducing the need for a further tightening of
monetary conditions. Signs of a slowdown in the Japanese economy fed
speculation that the Bank of Japan might lower its official interest rates,
contributing to downward pressure on the yen. Later in the period, concern
about events in the Soviet Union weighed particularly heavily against the
mark. Overall, the dollar rose 13-1/2 percent against the mark, 11 percent
against sterling, and 8 percent against the yen.
During the first week of the intermeeting period, with the dollar near
all-time lows against the mark
The Desk purchased about $850
million, all against marks,
The dollar's sharp rise later
prompted official dollar sales,
The Desk sold $330 million, $300 million of that against
marks and the rest against yen. The Desk's dollar sales were the first
since April of last year.
The strength of the Spanish peseta within the EMS stretched the
currency grid to near its limit. Maintaining current parities imposed a
constraint on monetary policy for the countries at the bottom of the band,

the United Kingdom and France, where economic slowdown created pressure to
ease interest rates. In mid-February, the Bank of Spain cut its money
market intervention rate 20 basis points and the Bank of England took
advantage of the opportunity by lowering its money market dealing rate 50
basis points. The Bank of England later eased another 50 basis points after
sterling moved away from the lower limit. Near the end of the period, after
evidence of slowing Spanish consumer price growth, the Bank of Spain lowered
its money market intervention rate a full percentage point to 13-1/2
percent. However, the peseta eased only slightly following that move, as it
was accompanied by the removal of a 30 percent deposit requirement on
foreign borrowing, which effectively had been a tax on inflows of capital
into Spain. The Bank of France followed by easing its money market
intervention rate 1/4 percentage point, but kept its 5-10 day RP rate
unchanged.
Foreign stock prices surged along with U.S. stock prices amid the war-
end euphoria. Stock prices rose most sharply in the United Kingdom (nearly
13 percent), but also rose strongly in Japan (10 percent) and Germany (7
percent).
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data on real GNP growth in the major foreign industrial countries in
the fourth quarter in general indicated a weakening of activity, although
conditions varied among individual countries. In both Japan and Germany,
real GNP growth slowed in the fourth quarter from its very strong third-
quarter rate, but growth remained positive and there have been tentative
indications of stronger activity early in the first quarter. In contrast,
in France, the United Kingdom, and Canada, real GNP declined in the fourth
quarter, in the latter two cases extending third-quarter reductions.

IV-16
Indicators of fourth-quarter activity in Italy also suggest continued
weakness.
Movements of inflation rates in the major industrial countries have
been mixed in recent months. Underlying price trends have been distorted by
special factors in several countries, with prices of perishable food falling
in Japan and the new Goods and Services Tax raising prices in Canada. The
recent weakness of foreign currencies against the dollar has not yet become
apparent in foreign price data. The most recent monthly figures show a
reduction in the German trade surplus and larger trade deficits in Italy and
the United Kingdom. In contrast, the trade surplus in Japan increased in
February.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, real GNP (s.a.) in the fourth quarter
increased 2.1 percent (s.a.), less than half the rate in the previous
quarter. Domestic demand fell slightly due to weak consumption (a rate of
decline of 1.1 percent), housing investment (down 6.3 percent), and a drop
in inventory investment by the private and, especially, government sectors.
Net exports made a positive contribution to fourth-quarter growth as exports
rose 12 percent and imports declined 2.3 percent.
Indicators of activity early in the first quarter have been mixed.
Some monthly indicators seem to be signaling weakness. New machinery orders
(s.a.) declined 4.2 percent in January, after falling 7.5 percent the
previous month, and were only 1.8 percent above year-earlier levels.
Corporate bankruptcies (s.a.) in February were 51.1 percent above their
level of a year ago. Monetary growth continues to fall dramatically, with
the 12-month rate of M2+CD growth dropping to 5.4 percent in February, well
below the peak rate of 13.2 percent reached last May, reflecting some
slackening of business loan demand. In contrast, other economic measures

suggest strong growth. Industrial production (s.a.) rose 1.3 percent in
January and showed a 7.5 percent increase from year-earlier levels. Retail
sales (s.a.) jumped 4.4 percent in January, raising their 12-month increase
in 8.2 percent. The unemployment rate (s.a.) declined to 2 percent in
January, its lowest level in over 10 years.
Recent measures of inflation have also been mixed. Consumer prices in
the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) declined 0.3 percent in February, lowering the 12-
month inflation rate to 3.8 percent from 4.3 percent in the previous month.
However, this movement was distorted by sharp swings in perishable food
prices. Excluding these items, the 12-month consumer price inflation rate
rose from 3.3 percent to 3.5 percent in February. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.)
declined by 0.4 percent in February and their 12-month rate of increase
eased to 1.6 percent. The closely watched spring wage round is about to
begin. Most private forecasts suggest that the government's goal of holding
increases to about last year's rate of 5.9 percent is likely to be achieved.
Provisional data indicate that real GNP in Western Germany (s.a.)
increased 1.5 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter. All elements of
domestic demand increased strongly; private consumption increased 3.1
percent, public consumption grew 4.8 percent, and fixed investment increased
6.6 percent. Net exports fell sharply, however, reducing the growth in
total GNP. This steep decline was due largely to a 38 percent (a.r.)
increase in imports.
Industrial production in Western Germany (s.a.) increased 3.6 percent
in January after declining slightly in November and December. The volume of
new orders for West German manufactured goods (s.a.) increased 2.8 percent
in January, partially reversing the decline over the preceding two months.
Retail sales (s.a.) in Western Germany increased 6.9 percent in January.

IV-21
West German unemployment (s.a.) fell to 6.2 percent in February, the lowest
rate in 10 years.
Unofficial estimates suggest that East German nominal GNP (n.s.a.)
increased about 5 percent in the fourth quarter, after falling about 25
percent in the third quarter. Private consumption is estimated to have
increased about 10 percent in the fourth quarter, and fixed investment to
have risen about 25 percent. Another substantial increase in imports and a
further sharp sell-off of inventories were the two most important factors
constraining growth in the fourth quarter. Industrial production in Eastern
Germany (n.s.a.) fell 10.5 percent in December, and for the fourth quarter
was 51 percent below year-earlier levels. Official East German unemployment
(n.s.a.) was 8.9 percent in February, up from 7.3 percent in January. The
number of workers engaged in government subsidized "short-time" work
(n.s.a.) increased 0.7 percent in October to 21.5 percent of the labor
force.
The combined German trade balance (n.s.a.) fell sharply in January to
just $10.4 billion (a.r.). This compares with a surplus rate of $40.6
billion in the fourth quarter. Exports (n.s.a.) fell 1.7 percent in January
relative to the average for the fourth quarter, while imports (n.s.a.)
increased 5.4 percent over the same period. The combined German current
account (n.s.a.) was in deficit by $9.5 billion (a.r.) in January, compared
with a surplus rate of $30 billion in the fourth quarter.
The Bundesbank announced that M3 (s.a.) in Western and Eastern Germany
combined increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in January. This figure
was depressed, however, by declines in M3 held in Eastern Germany. Given
this fact, the pace of M3 growth was unacceptably high, according to the
Bundesbank.

IV-22
Chancellor Kohl's government has accepted a 1991 Federal budget with
an anticipated deficit of 2-1/2 percent of GNP (DM 70 billion). Anticipated
increases in revenues (DM 35 billion) are larger than cuts in spending (DM
15 billion). What is notably absent is any substantial cut in subsidies. In
addition, Finance Minister Waigel has stated publicly that an increase in
the VAT, probably in connection with EC-1992 tax harmonization, will
probably be implemented after 1992.
Activity in France slowed sharply in the fourth quarter. Marketable
GDP (s.a.), an early indicator of total GDP that excludes most government
services, contracted 1.6 percent (a.r.). Fixed investment fell 3.2 percent,
and inventory accumulation fell precipitously after a rapid run-up in the
third quarter. The slowdown in activity was concentrated in the industrial
sector, with industrial production (s.a.) falling 10.4 percent (a.r.) in the
fourth quarter. Industrial production rose 3 percent in January, but survey
evidence indicates that it is likely to have contracted again in February.
Recent data show little sign of recovery from recession in the United
Kingdom. Real GDP (s.a.) fell 3.8 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter,
after contracting 5.1 percent in the third quarter. The decline in fourth-
quarter GDP stemmed mainly from sharp falls in consumption (down 6.1
percent) and fixed investment (down 9.6 percent). In January, industrial
output (s.a.) fell 0.3 percent to stand 3.8 percent below its year-earlier
level. Unemployment (s.a.) rose for the eleventh month in a row in
February, reaching a rate of 7 percent.
The 12-month retail price inflation rate (s.a.) eased to 9 percent in
January, the third successive month in which inflation declined. Excluding
mortgage interest payments and the poll tax, the 12-month rate of inflation
has fallen to 7.4 percent from a peak of 8.4 percent in October.

IV-23
On March 19, the government presented its budget for the fiscal year
beginning next month. The proposed budget appears to have a broadly neutral
fiscal impact, but, because of the recession, is forecast to swing into
deficit by £8 billion (1.3 percent of GNP) following a small surplus in the
fiscal year just ending. The unpopular poll tax is to be reduced
significantly, and probably will be replaced by a property tax. The VAT
rate is to be raised from 15 percent to 17.5 percent in order to finance a
central government takeover of many local government expenditure
responsibilities.
In Italy, indicators of economic activity continue to show weakness.
Industrial production (ns.a.) in December was 0.9 percent below its level a
year earlier. Capacity utilization (n.s.a.) rose slightly in the fourth
quarter, but remained below its level of a year earlier.
The 12-month change in the consumer price index (n.s.a.) in February
rose to 6.7 percent. This increase was due in large part to one-time
increases in administered prices in the communications, transportation, and
energy sectors. To offset the inflationary impact of these price increases,
the government has announced that it will reduce VAT rates on fuels and
railway tickets.
The recession continues in Canada, where real GDP (s.a.) fell 4.1
percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter, the third consecutive quarterly
decline. All components of domestic demand except government purchases
contracted. Unemployment (s.a.) rose to 10.2 percent in February, up from
9.3 percent in December.
Consumer prices (n.s.a.) rose 2.6 percent in January, increasing on a
year-over-year basis to 6.8 percent from 5 percent the previous month. This
increase was almost entirely due to the implementation of the Goods and
Services Tax on January 1.

IV-24
Finance Minister Michael Wilson presented the government's budget for
fiscal year 1991-92 in late February. Despite spending restraints, the
recession and high interest payments on debt have pushed the projected
federal budget deficit up to C$30.5 billion (4.5 percent of GDP). Wilson
also announced with Bank of Canada Governor John Crow the setting of
inflation targets in an effort to reduce inflation expectations on the path
to price stability. These targets provide for a year-over-year rate of
increase in the consumer price index of 3 percent by the end of 1992 and 2
percent by the end of 1995.
Developments in East European Economies
Paris Club creditors have agreed to write off about half of Poland's
official debt. The IMF has completed negotiations with governments in the
region on the terms of Extended Fund Facilities (Poland and Hungary), Stand-
by Arrangements, (Bulgaria, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, and
Romania) and Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facilities (for all five
countries). The IMF programs amount to between $1 and $2 billion each.
Despite declines in production by state-owned enterprises in 1990, increased
private sector activity is evident in the region, and growth in exports to
hard-currency markets was substantial in 1990.
Individual Country Notes. Paris Club creditors have agreed to a two-
phase reduction of Poland's official debt payments, to be followed by
further reductions upon successful completion of the three-year IMF program.
The Extended Fund Facility and a Compensatory and Contingency Financing
Facility amount to about $2 billion total. IMF Board approval is expected
in April. The Paris Club agreement sets the stage for similar debt relief
by commercial creditors.
Polish gross domestic product fell 12 percent in 1990. However, while
industrial output sold by the state-owned sector fell 23 percent, private

IV-25
sector output rose by 8.5 percent. Inflation measured on a December-over-
December basis was 250 percent, although only about 80 percent, on an annual
basis, over the second half of the year. Preliminary data for the year
indicate a hard-currency trade surplus of $3.8 billion. Hard currency
exports rose about 57 percent to $11.9 billion, while imports rose only 11
percent to $8.1 billion.
Hungary and the IMF have completed negotiations for a three-year
Extended Fund Facility for about $1.6 billion and a Compensatory and
Contingency Financing Facility with a potential for $490 million if oil
prices rise above those specified in the program.
In the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, the auction of small
businesses began in Prague in late January with the sale of 17 retail shops.
The final prices were well above the minimum asking price, and press
coverage noted that most of the successful bidders had access to foreign
capital.
In January, the IMF approved a 14 month stand-by arrangement of about
$880 million. Additional funds of about $210 million may be available
through the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility.
The price level rose about 25 percent in January over December,
reflecting the freeing of prices on January 1 as part of the move to a
market-oriented economy.
Economic Situation in Major Developing countries
In February, the Mexican government placed an international bond issue
in its own name for the first time in nine years. Mexico's current account
deficit rose in 1990 and is likely to climb further this year unless
remedial action is taken, particularly on the fiscal front. In Brazil, new
economic measures, including controls on wages, prices, and financial
investments, were implemented at the end of January. Progress has been made

IV-26
recently in negotiations with bank creditors on the payment of interest
arrears, and Brazil is following through on a promise to pay 30 percent of
current interest accruals. In Argentina, inflation rose to 27 percent in
February from 7.7 percent in January due to a sharp depreciation of the
austral. The exchange rate stabilized in February in response to tax
increases and the establishment of a trading band for the austral, but
additional fiscal adjustment is needed. In Venezuela, a $1.2 billion
aluminum smelter project was selected to receive substantial financing
through debt-equity swaps. Subscriptions to a $1,775 million commercial
bank loan to Colombia are largely complete. Nigeria and its commercial bank
creditors reached preliminary agreement in March on a debt reduction
arrangement covering $5.7 billion in external debt. In February, the IMF
approved a new financing package for the Philippines totaling SDR 629
million. Taiwan's cumulative trade surplus has remained unchanged in the
first two months of 1991 from the same period last year, while Korea
experienced a record current account deficit in January.
Individual Country Notes. In February, for the first time in nine
years, the Mexican government placed an issue in the international bond
market in its own name. The five-year, DM 300 million issue was priced to
yield 10.37 percent. The same week, the state oil company, PEMEX, placed a
two-year issue in the market and raised $125 million.
Moody's assigned a Ba2 rating to the new DM issue and commented that
the widening current account deficit, the large external debt burden, and
ongoing political uncertainty contributed to a rating below investment
grade. The current account deficit rose by an estimated $500 million in
1990 to nearly $6 billion, as imports rose 27 percent. The larger deficit
occurred in spite of a 28 percent increase in oil export earnings, a 13

IV-27
percent increase in non-oil exports, and savings on external interest
payments stemming from last year's bank financing package.
The current account deficit was more than offset by capital inflows,
including substantial capital repatriation by the private sector, and
international reserves rose by an estimated $2 billion. Foreign direct
investment inflows were large, but much capital flowed into short-term paper
and it could flow out rapidly if market perceptions of Mexico's prospects
should deteriorate as the current account deficit grows further. The lower
oil prices now prevailing, a monetary and fiscal policy stance that favors
relatively low real interest rates, and the continued real appreciation of
the peso against the dollar portend a widening of the current account
deficit in 1991. The deficit may rise to as much as $10 billion unless
remedial action is taken, particularly on the fiscal front.
Real GDP growth in 1990 was 3.9 percent, boosted by fourth-quarter
growth of 5.9 percent at an annual rate. Meanwhile, interest rates have
continued to decline. At the March 12 auction, the 28-day Treasury bill
rate was 21.7 percent, down from 23.5 percent on January 22. At the end of
November, the four monetary aggregates showed increases from year earlier
levels ranging from 45 to 69 percent.
In Brazil, at the end of January, the government announced a new
package of measures, called Collor II. Major elements of the package,
including new controls on prices, wages, and financial investments, seem
inconsistent with the government's pledge to reduce public sector
intervention in the economy. Anticipation of a price freeze, together with
continuing fiscal pressures, helped to spur inflation to 22 percent in
February, with the price index mainly reflecting price increases that
occurred in late January, just before the freeze was imposed. The price
controls have not yet led to widespread shortages, probably because of the

IV-28
recession and because the controls are not highly effective; prices are
believed to be rising by about 10 percent on a monthly basis.
In a speech on March 14, President Collor stated his intention to make
the private sector the motor of economic growth. He proposed a tax on large
fortunes, and an end to job guarantees for public-sector employees, which
will require amending the constitution. Collor also stated his intention to
privatize 27 government firms by 1992.
Brazil's real GDP fell 4.6 percent in 1990, according to revised data.
Industrial output fell 8.6 percent. The trade surplus in January 1991 was
$1.4 billion, up from $1 billion in December, and compared with $500 million
in January 1990.
Negotiations on the payment of interest arrears on medium- and long-
term debt to commercial banks have made progress recently, after Brazil
dropped its insistence on linking payments on these arrears to a
comprehensive debt restructuring. In March, Brazil followed through on an
earlier pledge and paid $352 million towards current interest, bringing
total payments to about 30 percent of interest accrued in the first quarter
of 1991. Discussions on a comprehensive debt restructuring are continuing.
In Argentina, consumer price inflation rose to 27 percent in February
(monthly basis) from 7.7 percent in January, due to a 59 percent run-up in
the austral price of the dollar during January. However, the exchange rate
stabilized in February in response to economic measures announced at the
beginning of that month by newly appointed Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo;
consumer price increases were concentrated at the beginning of February and
are believed to have moderated significantly thereafter. The new economic
measures included increases in the value-added tax and in various asset
taxes, as well as the establishment of a trading band for the exchange rate.
When the austral price of the dollar pierced the 10,000 austral ceiling of

IV-29
the band at the end of February, the central bank defended the band with a
record $252 million in foreign exchange sales and a five percentage point
increase in reserve requirements, causing the value of the dollar to sink to
about 9,600 australs in recent trading.
The tax hikes announced in February are not expected to be sufficient
to balance the budget. Due to transfers to the provinces, pension system
deficits, and a deterioration in tax revenues, the central government ran
non-interest operating deficits in both January and February. As a result
of earlier weak fiscal performance, Argentina missed the 1990 fourth-quarter
performance criteria under its IMF stand-by program, and therefore will not
receive a $240 million disbursement conditioned on achieving those targets.
Argentina currently is negotiating with the IMF on a new stand-by program.
In spite of set-backs in achieving macroeconomic stability, progress
toward structural adjustment is continuing. In February and March, the
World Bank and the IDB approved loans totaling $523 million to support
reforms in provincial administration and in the public enterprise sector.
Additionally, the government announced steps to eliminate non-tariff import
barriers and reduce significantly the average tariff level and the degree of
tariff dispersion.
A $1.2 billion aluminum smelter project was selected by the
authorities in Venezuela to be the first participant in a planned program of
large-scale investment projects to receive financing from debt-equity swaps.
The 300,000 metric-ton-per-year smelter is to be developed by a joint
venture owned 70 percent by Alcoa Aluminum and 30 percent by Venezuelan
companies. Morgan Guaranty is putting together the financing in the form of
$321 million in ordinary equity, $372 million in debt-equity conversions,
$100 million in supplier credits, and $448 million in bank credits.

IV-30
Subscriptions to a $1,775 million commercial bank loan to Colombia
were largely completed in February. The package includes a $1,575 million,
12.5-year loan paying LIBOR plus 1 percent, and a $200 million, 5-year
bearer-bond issue paying LIBOR plus 1.5 percent. In contrast to prior
concerted loan efforts for Colombia, the current syndication may be
oversubscribed, pending the decisions of a few remaining banks. The signing
of the loan, which will refinance 93 percent of maturing obligations on
Colombia's medium- and long-term commercial bank debt during 1991-94, is
expected in early April.
On March 2, Nigeria and its commercial bank creditors reached
preliminary agreement on a debt restructuring arrangement covering $5.7
billion of external debt. The arrangement is to include three options: a
Nigerian buyback of at least 60 percent of the debt at a price to be
determined by Nigeria; a par exchange for 30-year bonds paying 6.25 percent
interest with collateralized principal and 12 months of interest support;
and an exchange for 20-year bonds carrying market interest (without
enhancements) together with the lending of new money equal to 10 percent of
exposure. As part of the package, Nigeria has agreed to clear about $340
million of interest arrears to banks.
On February 20 the IMF approved a new financing package for the
Philippines totaling SDR 629 million. The package includes an 18-month
SDR 264 million stand-by credit, a SDR 277 million Compensatory and
Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF) to cover higher oil costs and an
expected export shortfall, as well as SDR 88 million in contingent CCFF
funds if a larger payments deficit occurs than is currently expected. The
IMF will set aside 25 percent of each drawing under the stand-by to support
operations involving debt reduction. The main aims of the current

IV-31
stabilization program are to reduce the rate of inflation, cut the balance
of payments deficit, and increase the level of international reserves.
In Taiwan, consumer prices rose 5.4 percent in the twelve months
ending in February, compared with 2.8 percent in the previous twelve months.
Taiwan's current account surplus fell slightly to $10.9 billion in 1990 from
$11.4 billion in 1989. In the first two months of 1991, the cumulative
trade surplus (on a customs basis) was unchanged at $1 billion from the same
period last year.
In Korea, consumer prices were 10.6 percent higher in January than a
year earlier, partly due to strong domestic demand stimulated by rapid money
growth over most of the previous year. Korea's current account deficit was
$1.5 billion in January, compared with $2.1 billion in all of 1990. In
1990, imports rose rapidly relative to exports due to strong domestic demand
and a large increase in oil imports.
