Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Incoming data point to a bottoming out of the recession during the
early spring and a subsequent upturn in economic activity. Domestic final
demand appears to be rising moderately, led by solid gains in consumer
spending. Inventory liquidation continued through April, helping to move
inventory-sales ratios back to more comfortable levels in many sectors.
With stocks sharply reduced, the production of motor vehicles has moved up
appreciably from its first-quarter low. Elsewhere in the manufacturing
sector, output appears to be leveling off or edging up slightly. "Core"
inflation has eased from its very rapid pace at the beginning of 1991.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor demand appears to have firmed. Total payroll employment edged up
59,000 in May, and the average workweek jumped 0.3 hour. As a result,
aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers moved up
0.9 percent--more than offsetting the April decline of 0.7 percent. After
dipping to 6.6 percent in April, the unemployment rate more than retraced
that movement in May, rising to 6.9 percent. However, averaging through the
last two readings, the unemployment rate has been essentially flat since
March. Filings for initial claims for unemployment insurance reached a
cyclical high of 535,000 (FRB seasonals) in late March and have fluctuated
narrowly just below 450,000 since the week ended May 11.
The May increase in payroll employment was fairly broad-based. The
diffusion index of monthly employment changes in 356 private industries
1. The unemployment rate when seasonally adjusted using a concurrent
method dropped 0.2 percentage point to 6.6 percent in April but returned to
6.8 percent in May.

moved up--indicating that, for the first time in a year, the number of
industries gaining jobs equalled the number losing them. Manufacturing
employment edged up in May. Recalls of workers in the motor vehicle
industry more than accounted for the increase, but most manufacturing
industries registered greatly moderated job losses or small job gains. The
notable exception was the machinery industry, where employment dropped
another 10,000. Construction employment turned up in May; that industry had
shed about half a million jobs since last June.
In the private service-producing sector, hiring rose in May, the first
increase since January. Business services gained 14,000 jobs, about equal
to its loss over the past three months, and employment in health services
continued its steady increase. Although employment fell further in
wholesale and retail trade, the pace of job losses slowed markedly.
Swings in employment as measured by the household survey were unusually
large over the April-May period, principally because of large swings in the
counts of individuals reporting themselves to be government workers or self-
employed (table). However, the household survey estimate of employment
changes for private wage and salary workers (excluding private household
workers) has flattened out in the past two months and is not sharply at odds
with the pattern in the establishment survey.

1. Components may not sum to totals because of independent seasonal
adjustment of the total and its components.
Other indicators from the household survey also point to a
stabilization of labor market conditions. Persons who reentered the
workforce or who were entering the labor force for the first time accounted
for almost half of the May increase in unemployment; earlier in the year,
job losers had dominated the net change in unemployment. The number of
individuals involuntarily employed part time for economic reasons also
declined over the past two months.
Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector grew at a 0.3 percent
annual rate in the first quarter of 1991, reflecting large and nearly
offsetting declines in both output and hours worked. The behavior of
productivity in this recession has differed somewhat from the typical
cyclical pattern. The typical pattern is that productivity flattens out or
declines near the end of an expansion; it subsequently declines sharply
early in a recession as production first slows and then is cut back while
labor continues to be hoarded. Productivity usually begins to stabilize in

the middle of recessions as firing becomes more aggressive and finally rises
sharply during the initial phase of a recovery as production snaps back.
In the current episode, however, productivity fell more than is typical
in the late expansion period--at a 1.6 percent annual rate between the
fourth quarter of 1988 and the first quarter of 1990--as output growth
decelerated sharply and firms continued to hire at a relatively rapid pace.
Productivity then began to stabilize prior to the cyclical peak, as firms
attempted to control labor costs and halt the slump in profits. This was
particularly true in manufacturing industries where competitive pressures
were greatest. These cost-cutting efforts continued during the recession
and were reflected in a prompt and aggressive shedding of labor as output
fell. This has been quite evident in construction and wholesale trade,
while manufacturers continued the process begun in early 1989.
Industrial Production
Industrial production rose in April and May, after declining sharply
earlier this year (table). The gains resulted, in part, from an increase in
motor vehicle output and a firming in industries that produce construction
supplies. In addition, unseasonably warm weather in May provided a
transitory boost to output at utilities, which raised the total IP index
more than 1/4 percent in that month.
From September to February, motor vehicle assemblies plunged 3-3/4
million units at an annual rate (FRB seasonals) and, when allowance is made
for both direct and indirect effects, accounted for nearly one-half of the
decline in total IP during this period. However, motor vehicle assemblies
have increased 1-1/4 million units since February, which has boosted the
total index by more than 1/4 percentage point in each month. Currently,

II-8
domestic makers have scheduled motor vehicle assemblies in June at a
9.2 million unit annual rate. However, in the first three weeks of June,
auto production was running about 4 percent short of the scheduled assembly
rate; truck production was about on schedule. If that pace continues for
the remainder of the month, domestic motor vehicle production for June would
likely be up slightly from the May level (table).

Domestic production:
Autos 6.9 5.6 5.1 5.1 5.3 5.3
Trucks 4.1 3.2 2.6 3.3 3.4 3.6
1. The estimate of domestic auto and truck production in June is based
on actual assemblies through the week ended June 21, as seasonally adjusted
by FRB staff.
Output of construction supplies, which dropped sharply late last year
and early this year, turned up in April and May, consistent with the pickup
in housing starts in recent months. In addition, part of the rebound in
output of consumer durables excluding motor vehicles (for example,
appliances, carpeting, and furniture) probably is attributable to a firming
in the housing sector.
Output of business equipment has continued to decline in recent months,
owing in part to weakness in production of office and computing machines and
industrial equipment. Although output in this sector continued to weaken
through May, production of capital goods typically continues to decline in
the initial months following a trough in the total index.

II-9
Capacity utilization in manufacturing edged down a bit further in May
and has declined nearly 6 percentage points since July 1990. During this
period, the operating rate in primary processing has dropped about
8 percentage points to 78.3 percent; while the current operating rate in
advanced processing industries, at 76.9 percent, has declined 5 percentage
points since last July.
Available physical product data for June are mostly pointing upward.
The expected increase in motor vehicle assemblies should contribute about
0.1 percentage point to total IP in June, and electricity generation through
mid-month is down only slightly from the May average. The most recent
observations on other physical product data, which include steel, plywood,
and paper, are up, on net, from their May averages; if these gains hold up
through the remainder of the month, these series would contribute about
1/4 percent to total IP in June. Adjusted durable goods orders rose
1-1/2 percent in May after a 5-1/4 percent increase in April. In recent
months, increases in new bookings have been fairly widespread--consistent
with an increase in June IP.
Personal Income
Although growth in personal income remained weak early in the second
quarter, signs of a pickup have begun to emerge. Private wages and salaries
rose $5.6 billion in April, the largest increase since December, and the
available labor market data indicate a sizable increase in May.2 Higher
subsidy payments to farmers boosted income growth substantially in March but
were partly reversed in April; growth in the remaining components of income
2. Revised labor market data indicate a sharper decline in employment and
the workweek in April than originally reported, which likely will cause the
wages and salaries component of personal income to be lowered for the month.

$4.3 billion in April. However, the decline follows a $9.5 billion rise in
March.
On balance, real DPI fell 1-1/4 percent in the first two quarters of
this recession--a relatively large decline by historical standards compared
with the contraction in real GNP. On average, real DPI as a percent of real
GNP has risen 0.9 percentage point in the first two quarters of a recession,
while in the recent downturn, it fell 0.2 percentage point (table). Part of
this difference reflects shifts in relative prices associated with the
increase in excise taxes and the oil price shock. 3 But the bulk of the
discrepancy lies in the growth of nominal DPI relative to GNP and can be
traced principally to two components: private wages and salaries and
personal interest income.
Private wages and salaries fell more in this recession than would be
expected given the movements in GNP. In large part, this is the flip side
of the better-than-average, peak-to-trough productivity performance: Hours
fell more rapidly than is typical, as firms moved aggressively to trim
payrolls and cut costs. In addition, slow growth in average hourly earnings
in 1990:Q4 and 1991:Q1 contributed to sluggish growth in private wages and
salaries.
3. Technically, higher energy prices boosted consumer prices (the PCE
deflator), which are used to deflate nominal disposable income, more than
the GNP deflator. Prices of the goods consumed in the United States rose
more rapidly than the prices of goods produced, in part because of the
U. S. position as a net importer of petroleum products.

Changes in interest income also have been unusual during this downturn.
Rather than rising strongly as in previous recessions, the level of interest
income has fallen slightly. Interest income is affected by both the growth
in assets and interest rates, and it is the behavior of interest rates that
appears atypical. Most previous recessions were preceded by periods of
rising interest rates, resulting in a rise in interest income during the
first two quarters of the downturn. However, in the current episode, the
cyclical peak was preceded by falling interest rates, which has generated
declines in interest income over the course of this recession.
Tax policy may have been slightly less effective at stabilizing
disposable income in the recent recession and boosting DPI in the early
phases of the recovery. Only during the initial phase of the 1973 recession
did personal federal tax payments fall more slowly. Although this result is
partially explained by the decline in marginal tax rates legislated in the
1986 Tax Reform Act, the more important explanation concerns discretionary
tax policy. Tax cuts occurred in each of the past three recessions,
although taxes were not reduced until six quarters after the onset of the
1973 recession. In contrast, discretionary fiscal policy has been
restrictive in the current recession, and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act passed in October 1990 is estimated to have raised revenues $32 billion,
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, in the first two quarters of FY1991;
$13.5 billion of this increase represents higher income and social insurance
taxes.
Consumer Spending
Incoming data suggest that personal consumption expenditures are
continuing on the upward course that has prevailed since the apparent trough

II-14
in spending in January. Sales of cars and light trucks picked up in May and
rose further in the first 20 days of June. Spending on goods other than
motor vehicles rose sharply in May, while the consumption of services also
has strengthened noticeably.
Nominal sales at stores in the retail control category, which provide a
reading on consumption expenditures for goods other than motor vehicles,
rose 1.0 percent in May.4 Sales were particularly strong for the second
consecutive month at general merchandise stores, apparel outlets, and
furniture and appliance stores, where spending is thought to be largely
discretionary. With prices for comparable items rising about 0.4 percent in
last month's CPI, May retail sales likely will translate into a sizable
increase in real PCE for goods other than motor vehicles. Sales at gasoline
stations also increased, but the rise appears to reflect higher prices for
gasoline.
Although sales of motor vehicles have strengthened in recent weeks,
they remain quite weak by historical standards. Domestically produced light
vehicles sold at a 10.4 million unit annual rate in the first twenty days of
June, up from a 9.6 million unit annual pace in May. The recent pickup was
particularly notable in the market of light trucks and vans, where sales
were especially sluggish last winter. Sales of imported autos also have
recovered from their weak January-February pace.
4. The retail control category is calculated by subtracting sales at auto
dealers and building materials and supply stores from total retail sales.

Service outlays were estimated to have increased 0.5 percent in April
and 0.9 percent in March; spending in both months was boosted by a rebound
in energy outlays, further strong gains in medical services, and increases
in net foreign travel. Information on spending on services in May is not
yet available, but with temperatures unseasonably warm in many parts of the
country, outlays likely were boosted by higher spending on electricity for
air conditioning.
Because the recent increases in personal consumption expenditures have
come against a backdrop of continued weakness in real disposable personal
income, the personal saving rate dropped to around 3-1/2 percent in March
and April. That reading is a touch below the rates that prevailed early in
the third quarter of last year, when consumers dipped into their saving to

spend through what apparently was perceived as a transitory surge in energy
prices following the invasion of Kuwait. The rebound in the saving rate
this winter roughly coincided with the beginning of the downturn in consumer
energy prices and likely also was supported by households' increased
uncertainty about future employment prospects because of the deepening
recession. Some of the recent decline in the saving rate may reflect
increased consumer optimism about the economy. The unusually large decline
in personal interest income also may account for a small portion;
historically, consumption expenditures have not been very sensitive to
fluctuations in interest income, and as a result, a decline in interest
income tends to lower the saving rate in the short run.
Housing Markets
The housing sector has been on a path of gradual recovery in recent
months. Single-family housing starts strengthened in April and May, and
sales of new and existing homes moved higher. However, construction
activity in the multifamily sector remains quite weak. Starts of
multifamily units fell further in May. Regionally, data for April and May
suggest that construction in each of the four Census regions now may have
bottomed out (table).
By May, single-family housing starts stood 28 percent above the January
level when starts hit a recent low. The pickup in production is consistent
with this year's gradual expansion of demand for single-family homes. The
volume of new home sales rose for the third consecutive month in April,
reaching the half-million unit pace for the first time since last September
5. Construction first began to decline in the South, and the contraction
has been most severe in the Northeast.

and rising 21 percent above the eight-year low recorded in January. In the
market for existing homes, sales rose an additional 6 percent in May to
their highest monthly volume in a year and a half. Recent sales prices of
existing homes also suggest some firming in demand. Surveys of housing
market participants indicate a pickup in activity in the single-family
sector. Homebuilders surveyed by their national association at the end of
May reported about the same improved volume of current sales and
expectations for the year ahead as they had reported in late April.
Consumer attitudes, meanwhile, remain more favorable toward homebuying than
at any time since 1988, according to the University of Michigan's surveys in
May and June.
In the still-depressed multifamily sector, starts fell to an annual
pace of 150,000 units in May, the lowest monthly reading since the 1950s.
However, the average level of permit issuance for multifamily construction
in recent months suggests that the true level of apartment and condominium
construction might be somewhat higher than the May estimate of starts would
indicate. Nevertheless, multifamily construction clearly is quite weak and
is unlikely to recover in the near term. More than 80 percent of all newly
built multifamily housing units are rental apartments, and vacancy rates
remain high at almost 9-1/2 percent. Until these rates come down
substantially, a sustained increase in developer interest in construction of
multifamily housing is unlikely. Even then, lenders are likely to remain
cautious.
Inventories of unsold new homes have continued to trend down in part
because of a falloff in speculative construction. While most of the drop-
off in speculative construction reflects normal cyclical movements, the

decline as a share of single-family starts has been somewhat greater than in
previous cycles and may indicate that lenders have been particularly
cautious (chart). By the end of April, inventories had dropped
20 percent from the cyclical peak in 1989.
Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for business fixed investment fell 16-1/4 percent at an
annual rate in the first quarter. 7 Declines were registered in almost
every major category, with double-digit drops posted by spending on motor
vehicles, industrial equipment, and office and other commercial building.
However, recent indicators suggest some flattening out of the path for both
equipment and structures.
For equipment, the most recent orders and shipments data suggest that
spending may have stabilized somewhat in the current quarter. Indeed, the
average level of nominal PDE shipments in April and May, including aircraft
and weighted to reflect only final business purchases, was 1.2 percent above
the first-quarter level. Much of this rise reflects greater shipments of
complete aircraft, but spending on other types of equipment edged up as
well. In addition, although nominal computer shipments have been soft
6. Speculative construction represents new homes that are built before

7. Nominal BFI fell at a 14-3/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter;
in contrast, the latest Commerce Department survey of nominal plant and
equipment expenditures (P&E) reported a 5 percent increase at an annual rate
in the first quarter. Such a discrepancy reflects the fact that the two
investment series are obtained from very different sources. BFI reflects
the actual shipment of equipment and the progress made in new construction,
while P&E is measured from the recorded expenditures of firms. In addition,
there are differences in coverage that can only be reconciled on an annual
basis. For example, capital expenditures by the farm sector and outlays for
new motor vehicles held for less than one year are included in BFI but not
in P&E. Thus, the P&E estimate for the first quarter provides little
evidence that BFI was stronger than reported.

recently (chart), computer prices have been falling quite rapidly because of
competitive pressures, and real gains in spending are likely in the current
quarter. Finally, with total auto and light truck sales rebounding this
quarter, business purchases of motor vehicles are likely to stabilize as
well.
On the nonresidential construction side, excluding drilling and mining,
outlays fell rapidly between the middle of last year and 1991:Q1. A large
overhang of commercial space along with recessionary declines in most other
sectors depressed spending. However, a pause in this decline is suggested
by the nominal construction put-in-place data for April, which stood almost
1 percent above the first-quarter average. Although the construction
estimates are subject to large revisions, it also appears that total
contracts for new construction flattened out a bit last quarter as well.
The current-quarter outlook for drilling and mining is decidedly
negative. Although this sector was supported through the recession by the
run-up in oil prices, a retrenchment now appears to be in progress. Footage
drilled dropped sharply in April, and the May level of rigs in use was
10 percent below that in the first quarter.
Excess supply remains a problem in the real estate market. Coldwell-
Banker estimates that national vacancy rates for office buildings stood at
19.5 percent at the end of the first quarter, close to its record high of
21.5 percent in early 1987. Similarly, the industrial vacancy rate was
7 percent--above its average of the past few years. Thus, it is likely that
8. Recent reports indicate that computer manufacturers have cut prices on
personal computers in order to maintain or regain market share. As a
result, the April and May average of the new PPI measure of prices for
electronic computers fell 12 percent (at an annual rate) relative to
1991:Q1.

II-26
nonresidential construction will provide some drag to the economy over the
next year. Nonresidential building typically lags the business cycle at
troughs and does not play an important role in spurring the economy during
the initial phase of a recovery (chart). Indeed, averaging across the last
six recessions, nonresidential building (excluding drilling and mining) has
fallen almost 1-1/2 percent in the four quarters following a business cycle
trough.
Inventories
Business inventory liquidation continued through April. Inventories in
manufacturing and trade were depleted at a $53.5 billion (current-cost)
annual rate in April, following a $29.3 billion rate of liquidation in the
first quarter. These sharp inventory corrections have returned inventory-
sales ratios for most industries to the middle portions of the ranges of
the past year.
After a sharp runoff around the turn of the year, factory stocks posted
a net decline of $2 billion in real terms during the first quarter as a
whole. Preliminary current-cost data suggest that manufacturers' inventory
corrections continued in April. Since the recession began last summer,
manufacturers' inventory imbalances have been concentrated in upstream
industries--primary metals, chemicals, rubber and plastics--likely
reflecting the reduced demand for production materials as industrial
producers trimmed their output. The absence of excess stocks at final goods
industries at present suggests that production may rise quickly once
companies are confident that the recovery in final demand is firmly
established.

II-27
Real automotive inventories were reduced at an annual pace of
$18.2 billion in the first quarter, and because of conservative assemblies
so far this year and recent increases in sales, dealers' inventories have
been drawn down further. At the May pace of sales, this level of stocks
amounts to only 46 days of supply--the lowest since September 1986, when
inventories dropped sharply after automakers put into place massive consumer
buying incentives. 9 Days' supply of light trucks stood at 72 in May.

1. FRB seasonal factors.
The pace of nonauto retail inventory liquidation appears to have
slowed early this spring. In response to substantial drawdowns since
January, inventory-sales ratios for most types of nonauto retail
establishments have eased. In particular, for the broad range of stores in
the GAF grouping, a sizable gain in sales in April helped to lower the
inventory-sales ratio to the lowest level since early 1990. Given the
further pickup in GAF sales in May, non-auto retailers may need to replenish
their stocks. Indeed, the recent increases in orders received by domestic
9. The low reading on days' supply is affected to some extent by
automakers' recent incentive programs to commercial rental fleets. This
causes auto dealers to hold fewer new cars in inventory.

producers of home goods, apparel, and household durables suggest that this
process already may be under way.
Merchant wholesalers reduced their stocks at a faster pace in April
than earlier in the year, and wholesale inventories currently appear, on
balance, to have returned to satisfactory levels. The bulk of the wholesale
liquidation was in stocks of business and industrial machinery. Over the
preceding year, wholesale machinery inventories had risen persistently as
shipments weakened. The sharp liquidation in April reduced the inventory-
sales ratio for wholesalers in this category to 2.36 months in April,
markedly lower than the recent high of 2.47 months registered in February.
The Federal Government
The federal government posted a $23 billion deficit in April and May
(table). This was up substantially from the $1 billion deficit recorded
during the same period of 1990, owing to a combination of increased outlays
and lower receipts. Relative to a year ago, outlays in April and May
increased 8 percent despite a $3 billion reduction in deposit insurance
outlays and $11 billion in offsetting contributions to the Defense
Cooperation Account (DCA). The growth in outlays is largely attributable to
strong growth in defense spending (excluding DCA), and health and income
security related spending. However, much of the increase in defense
spending reflects shifts in military pay dates. Receipts declined 2 percent
in April and May relative to a year ago, as weak nominal income growth cut
into personal tax collections. Nonwithheld income and social insurance
taxes fell, and refunds rose relative to last year. This reflects, in part,
reduced final settlements on 1990 liabilities as a result of the recession.

Taxes in 1990 were withheld at rates based on the anticipation of a full-
year's pay; therefore, employees who were laid off for part of the year
tended to be overwithheld. For the fiscal year through May, the deficit
stands at $175 billion, up $23 billion from the year-earlier period.
On May 22, the House and Senate passed the FY1992 Congressional. Budget
Resolution. As expected, the resolution adheres closely to last October's
budget agreement and contains no significant new tax or spending
initiatives. Real defense expenditures, excluding those attributable to
Operation Desert Storm, are slated to fall about 4 percent. Other real
discretionary spending is held approximately constant, and tax revenues and
mandatory spending are set to their baseline levels.
State and Local Governments
Recent data indicate that growth in real purchases of goods and
services by state and local governments has remained weak in the second
quarter, reflecting efforts by many governments to check spending in
response to severe revenue shortfalls. Employment growth was slow again in
May, and over the first five months of 1991, was only about half the pace of
last year. Real outlays for construction fell in April to a level 2 percent
below their first-quarter average.
During the past six months, almost every state has anticipated
imbalances between current receipts and expenditures for fiscal 1991, as
eroding budgets became more widespread (chart). In addition, revenue
shortfalls remaining from FY1991 will be carried forward into the next
fiscal year, which begins July 1 for most governments. For the upcoming
fiscal year, some governments are being forced to make deep cuts in spending
and to hike taxes substantially to correct structural imbalances that have

been building for some time and were exacerbated by the recession. Whereas,
earlier, some governments had tried to balance budgets by making minor tax
and spending changes, selling assets, or transferring funds, many states
(including California, Pennsylvania, New York, and Connecticut) will likely
see major tax increases in coming months. In some states, like New Jersey,
which raised taxes substantially last year, sizable spending cuts are in
train. Among the cities, Philadelphia is planning to both reduce outlays
and to raise the sales tax; in the meantime, a $130 million payment into the
pension fund has been postponed, and construction fund balances are being
drawn down. In Bridgeport, Connecticut, where the choices included another
round of reductions in services and an 18 percent hike in property taxes,
the Mayor opted to file for bankruptcy, which would allow the city time to
restructure its liabilities. (See the financial portion of Part 2 for a
more detailed discussion of the Bridgeport bankruptcy.)
Labor Costs
Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers moved
up 0.4 percent in May (table). Over the twelve months ended in May, average
hourly earnings increased 3.4 percent, about 1/2 percentage point below the
pace recorded during the previous twelve months (chart).

The BLS recently published data on employer costs--including detailed
data on benefits--from a once-a-year survey conducted in March. 10 Growth
in both wages and benefits between March 1990 and March 1991 decelerated
markedly from their pace over the previous twelve months. The deceleration
was evident in most components of benefit costs, with the notable exception
of insurance costs, which includes health care premiums. These increased
nearly 10 percent over the twelve months ended in March. Continuing the
trend of recent years, benefit costs (constituting 28 percent of total
compensation) rose more rapidly than wages, driven by higher insurance
costs.
Food Prices and Agricultural Conditions
Swings in prices of fruits and vegetables have continued to dominate
the monthly pattern of food prices. The CPI for fresh vegetables retreated
2-1/4 percent in May, after climbing 15-1/2 percent in April. The recent
run-up in fresh vegetable prices has reflected supply problems--in part
weather-related--that are expected to be relatively short-lived. In
contrast, the prices of livestock products were nearly flat in May and have
registered little change, on balance, so far this year; increases in the
price of beef were largely offset by declines in the price of pork. Price
increases for other food categories have maintained an average monthly pace
of about 0.2 percent since late last year.
10. In contrast to the procedure used for computing pay changes in the
Employment Cost Index (ECI), which uses fixed employment weights from the
1980 Census, this survey uses current employment weights in each year. Over
the past three years, employer costs increased at a somewhat slower rate
than the ECI, suggesting a shift toward lower-paid occupations and
industries.

Despite planting problems in some areas of the country, almost all of
the 1991 crop now is sown. Growing conditions have been excellent for the
bulk of the acreage planted to corn this year. However, estimates by the
USDA call for the production of wheat to be down about 25 percent in 1991
from last year's above-average harvest (table), owing to a combination of
altered government programs, low prices for wheat, and poor growing
conditions late in the winter wheat season in some areas. The production of
soybeans also is projected to fall this year.
The recent flooding in some parts of northern Iowa and southern
Minnesota adds uncertainty to projections about the mix of crops that will
be grown in 1991. Although corn is traditionally the major crop in these
areas, crop specialists claim that corn yields fall precipitously if planted
after mid-June. As a result, some acreage that would have been planted to
corn may be switched to soybeans. Flooding along the Gulf Coast also is
reported to be causing problems with the cotton crop. However, famers in
these areas had planned to expand acreage sharply in response to higher
prices and less restrictive government programs on cotton. As a result,
even with some flood damage, production at this point appears likely to
surpass the bumper crop of last year.
Recently, the United States extended an additional $1.5 billion in
export credits to the Soviet Union, which are likely to keep grain
inventories lean by historical standards. Nonetheless, this year's
anticipated harvest for total grains in the U.S. appears to be large enough
to meet consumption demand and to keep domestic inventories fairly stable.
This was reflected in futures prices for grain, which did not react to the
announcement of the export credits.

In livestock markets, the USDA projects that the production of meats
and poultry will rise about 3 percent in 1991. Growth in the output of
poultry is expected to slow, although production still is expected to be up
about 4-1/2 percent. Production of both beef and pork are expected to
rebound in 1991 as producers respond to the high prices seen during the past
several years.
Energy Prices and Supplies
Energy prices were up 1.4 percent in the May CPI, after five months of
declines. Prices of motor fuel rose 2.5 percent, reflecting higher refinery
prices associated with critically low levels of gasoline inventories.
According to private survey data for early June, gasoline prices at retail
have moved up further. However, inventories of gasoline have rebounded to
the low end of the normal seasonal range, and prices of crude oil have
receded. These developments point to a near-term easing of the recent
upward pressures on gasoline prices.
Prices
The CPI excluding food and energy rose 0.1 percent in March and
0.2 percent per month in April and May, down significantly from the
3/4 percent increases in the first two months of this year. This dropoff
has reflected, in part, reversals of some of the large increases that
boosted this measure early in the year. In the services component, airfares
have fallen in the last three months, particularly in April, and have
largely retraced their preceding climb. The index for lodging while out of
town also has retreated since February, but remained about 16 percent above
its level of a year earlier. Among goods, apparel prices moved down in
March and April but were up in May. The prices of new vehicles decelerated

in recent months but have not reversed the large increases registered in
January and February. In addition, the CPI for nonenergy services was held
down in May by a relatively small increase in the index for owners'
equivalent rent.
Despite this recent slowing, significant progress in reducing the
trend of inflation has been rather difficult to discern in the data over
longer time spans: For example, in the twelve months ended in May, the CPI
excluding food and energy rose 5.1 percent, up from 4.8 percent during the
comparable period ending in May 1990 and 4.6 percent in May 1989 (table).
Part of this pickup reflects higher federal excise taxes on alcoholic
beverages and tobacco, and the increase in postal rates in February; the
January-February increases in these components added about 0.3 percent to
the level of prices. But the pace of price increases is up as well for a
number of other goods and services. Prices of both new vehicles and used
cars have accelerated over the past year. In addition, the cost of medical
care and the prices of educational services continue to rise rapidly.
Although, when looked at this way, the core inflation rate has changed
little over the past year, recent trends in the factors thought to influence
prices bode well for the outlook. Considerable slack now exists in labor
markets, which has begun to put downward pressure on the growth in
compensation costs. In addition, inflation expectations appear to have
moved down to about 4-1/4 percent--1/4 percentage point lower than a year
earlier--and the appreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar in
1991 likely is restraining price increases on imported goods and their
domestic substitutes.

At the producer level, prices of intermediate materials less food and
energy edged down 0.1 percent further in May. Widespread declines--notably
for petrochemicals, plastics, and metals--more than offset increases for
softwood lumber, plywood, and some more processed materials. The PPI for
crude nonfood materials less energy fell 0.8 percent, mainly reflecting
lower prices for scrap metals. This index has declined in seven of the last
ten months and is about 5-1/2 percent below its level of a year earlier.
Measures of commodity prices, although erratic, have tended to bottom
out around or soon after recession troughs. 11 The Journal of Commerce
index for industrial metals has edged down 1/4 percent, on balance, since
the week of the last Greenbook, and the CRB spot index for industrials has
declined about 2-3/4 percent (chart). Among the major industrial metals,
spot prices are down, on net, for steel scrap and copper, but may have
bottomed out for aluminum, which had registered steep declines from its 1988
peak. In contrast to metals, prices of lumber and plywood have soared over
the past two months, accounting for the increase in the Journal of Commerce
index total. 12 Although there has been some pickup in demand, market
observers attribute most of the upward pressures to problems with timber
supplies--logging restrictions in the Pacific Northwest and heavy rains in
the South.
11. However, in 1975, several commodity price measures declined for four
months after the March trough designated by the NBER. The index of leading
economic indicators includes a measure for "sensitive materials prices"
based on smoothed commodity price changes; it appears to have leveled off in
the past few months.
12. Plywood has a substantial weight in the Journal of Commerce index but
is not included in the CRB spot industrials measure.

'Each probability represents the likelihood that an expansion will begin during the next three months.

II-47
Probability of Expansion
The Commerce Department's composite index of leading economic
indicators rose 0.6 percent in April--its third consecutive monthly
increase. Movements in the composite index can be translated into
probability forecasts of the start of an expansion. The April reading
implies an 86 percent probability that a cyclical trough already has
occurred or will occur by July (chart).
Indeed, recent data suggest that the economy already may have bottomed
out. Identifying an exact month of the most recent cyclical trough remains
somewhat tenuous given the preliminary nature of much of the data in hand;
however, a variety of coincident indicators can be used to narrow the range
of likely dates. The coincident indicators include real income and
consumption, which bottomed out in the first two months of 1991 (table).
Industrial production and manufacturing and trade sales troughed in March,
and the employment series reached low points in April and May. If the low
values reached by these individual series are confirmed in later data
releases, March and April are likely candidates for the latest cyclical
trough.
1987-Based Real GNP
At the end of November 1991, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will
release its quinquennial revision to the National Income and Product
Accounts. In addition to incorporating data from the 1987 Economic Censuses
and the 1982 input-output table, the BEA will shift the base year of the
accounts from 1982 to 1987. This section briefly reviews the likely effects

of rebasing on the record of economic growth and inflation. 13 The analysis
uses the BEA estimate of 1987-based real GNP through the preliminary figure
for 1991:Q1 and extends the series over the Greenbook projection horizon
using a staff estimate derived from our projections of twenty key components
14of GNP. The focus is on how the depth and duration of the 1990-1991
recession and the dimensions of the ensuing recovery are expected to be
influenced by the shift to the 1987 base year. -
Real GNP. In moving to a 1987 base year, the BEA will deflate all
nominal expenditure components by price indexes that are normalized to
reflect the structure of relative prices prevailing in 1987 rather than
1982. Such a renormalization has the effect of eliminating the changes in
relative prices that have occurred between the 1982 and 1987 base years.
For example, computer prices fell 60 percent between 1982 and 1987, reducing
the level of the 1982-based computer deflator to 0.4, while the deflator for
the remainder of GNP rose 19 percent to 1.19. The shift in base years will
reset all deflators to 1.0 in 1987. As a result, given unchanged current-
dollar (nominal) computer expenditures, the deflation process (i.e.,
dividing by 1.0 rather than 0.4) will yield less "real" computer
expenditures relative to other goods and services on the 1987 basis than on
the 1982 basis.
As a general rule, a measure of real GNP based on the prices of a more
recent year increases less rapidly than a measure based on prices of an
earlier year. This reflects both the arithmetic of the deflation process as
13. For a detailed discussion of these issues, see Allan H. Young,
"Alternative Measures of Real GNP," Survey of Current Business, April 1989,
pp. 27-34.
14. BEA's measure of real GNP is calculated at significantly greater levels
of disaggregation than the FRB staff estimate.

well as the tendency, over time, for categories of expenditure that have the
smallest price increases (or the largest price declines) to experience the
fastest growth in volume. Thus, as the computer example above suggests,
when real GNP is recalculated on the more-recent base, the share in real GNP
of those goods declines. In effect, a smaller weight is given to the
fastest-growing items; because the growth rate of real GNP is a weighted
average of its components, the shift to the more-recent base year reduces
the historical rate of growth in real GNP.
The table presents the expenditure shares of key components of real GNP
in the fourth quarter of 1990 when measured in both 1982 and 1987 dollars.
The critical differences (shown in bold type) occur in two areas, computers
and energy. The share in real GNP of business purchases of computers falls
2.2 percentage points, while the shares of computer exports and imports
decline 1.6 percentage points and 1.4 percentage points, respectively. In
the energy sector, the price of imported crude oil and refined products fell
from $31.50 per barrel in 1982 to $17.30 per barrel in 1987. As a result of
this significant shift in relative prices, rebasing to 1987 reduces
the share in real GNP of imported crude oil and petroleum products
1.1 percentage points and the share of consumer purchases of gas and fuel
oil 0.6 percentage point.
GNP prices. Inflation, as measured by the GNP fixed-weight price
index, is lower with the 1987 base year. The reason for this is the same as
for real GNP: Over the 1982-87 period, substitution took place that lowered
the weight of those items in the fixed-weight price index whose prices were
rising rapidly. In contrast, the shift in the base year to 1987 raises the
rate of increase in the GNP deflator; this is just the counterpart of the

II-52
slower real GNP growth. Assuming no change in the growth of nominal GNP,
the slower real GNP growth implies larger increases in the GNP deflator. 15
The 1990-91 recession on a 1987 base. The depth and duration of the
current recession are not likely to be significantly different on a 1987
basis than measured currently. As shown in the table below, the decline in
real GNP in the fourth quarter of 1990 is larger in 1987 dollars, and the
drop in the first quarter of 1991 is about the same. On balance, assuming
the second quarter shows a zero or small positive real GNP change on both
measures, the peak-to-trough decline in real GNP is 1 percent in 1982
dollars and 1.4 percent in 1987 dollars. Inflation over the most recent two
quarters, as measured by the GNP fixed-weight price index, is about
1/4 percentage point lower than on the 1982 basis. Increases in the GNP
deflator average about 3/4 percentage point higher over this period, but
given the lower weight assigned to oil imports, the gyrations associated
with the swings in oil prices during the fourth and first quarters are
smoothed considerably in the 1987-based measure.
15. The mathematics of index numbers ensures that movements in the 1987-
based GNP deflator over the 198.2-87 period are the same as those of the
1982-based GNP fixed-weight price index. In effect, computing the percent
change in the 1987-based GNP deflator between 1982 and 1987 uses the
expenditure shares prevailing in 1982; this raises the weight in the GNP
deflator of those items whose prices rose rapidly over this period.

GNP growth in the recovery. Looking ahead, the rebasing of real GNP is
not expected to have a significant effect on the projected dimensions of the
economic recovery. The lower weight given to computer purchases likely will
hold down real GNP growth when measured in 1987 rather than 1982 dollars,
but this may be partially offset by the larger weight given to PCE services.
In general, growth in this recovery is expected to be relatively well
balanced across sectors, and as a result, the shifting of weights associated
with rebasing is not expected to have a significant effect on real GNP
growth over the Greenbook projection horizon.
Rebasing also will affect the staff's estimates of potential output.
The slower growth between 1982 and 1990 in real GNP in 1987 dollars likely
will result in a small downward adjustment to the estimated trend in the
growth of labor productivity over this period and, hence, to the historical

II-54
growth rate of potential output. Judging by prior experience with the
rebasing of real GNP, the levels of actual and potential GNP tend to be
revised downward proportionally, leaving the estimated margin of slack in
the economy little changed by the shift in base years. Looking ahead,
revisions to the projected growth in potential output will depend on the
extent to which historical downward revisions to trend growth in labor
productivity are carried forward. Given that the other determinants of
potential output (e.g., growth in potential labor input) are unaffected by
the rebasing, downward revisions to projections of trend productivity growth
would have a one-to-one effect on potential output growth.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Since the May FOMC meeting, federal funds have traded in a narrow range
around 5-3/4 percent. Most other market interest rates have risen somewhat
over the period, however, in response to accumulating evidence that the
economic recovery has begun and therefore that no further monetary easings
are in the offing. On balance, most yields are up 5 to 25 basis points.
Despite the apparent firming in income and spending, growth in the
broader monetary aggregates has been sluggish in May and June. M2 has
expanded at about a 3-1/2 percent pace over the two months, placing this
aggregate a little below the midpoint of its annual range. M3 has grown
little since March, leaving this aggregate also in the middle portion of its
1991 target range. Damped monetary expansion, especially in M3, probably
reflects continued weakness in asset expansion at banks and thrifts.
Borrowing at banks and in the commercial paper market by nonfinancial
businesses remains weak, partially offsetting continued strong issuance of
bonds. Many corporations have apparently sought to take advantage of
relatively favorable capital market conditions to strengthen their balance
sheets. In the federal sector, Treasury net borrowing from the public has
been restrained by the reduced activity of the RTC in the current quarter.
Issuance of tax-exempt securities has been strong in recent months; June's
volume was bolstered by unusually large short-term issues of New York State
and Los Angeles. Limited data in the second quarter suggest a slight pickup
in net borrowing by the household sector.

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
In May, M2 expanded at a 4-3/4 percent annual rate, which was slightly
faster than its pace from the fourth quarter of last year through April.
Preliminary data, however, point to a slower pace in June. One factor
holding down the growth of M2 may be shifts by households to higher yielding
non-M2 assets.
Liquid retail deposits--OCDs, savings, and MMDAs--have remained the
strongest component of M2; they have benefitted from the sluggish response
of their offering rates to the cumulative declines in short-term market
rates over the past several months. But small time deposits, whose yields
have largely tracked the downward trajectory of money market rates, have
continued to contract. With rates on most maturing small time deposits
substantially above those currently available, households with maturing CDs
may be looking outside M2 for better returns. Indeed, flows into both bond
and equity mutual funds have been robust of late. Previous episodes of
sharp declines in rates on small time deposits have been followed by strong
inflows to long-term mutual funds (chart). Sluggish inflows to money market
mutual funds may also be symptomatic of investors' reaching for the higher
yields available at the longer end of the maturity spectrum.
M3 barely increased in April and in May, and partial data suggest no
significant change in June. With institutional MMMFs no longer benefiting
from the lagged response of their yields to declining market interest rates,
the only component of non-M2 M3 that has shown any strength lately has been
large time deposits at branches and agencies of foreign banks. Evidence
continues to suggest that the surge in large time deposits at foreign

branches since the change in reserve requirements reflects substitution away
from other liabilities, the rebooking of assets formerly held offshore, and
lending to overseas affiliates.
By contrast, large time deposits continued to decline at a brisk pace
at thrifts in May and June, and were relatively flat at domestically
chartered banks. Domestic depositories ran down other managed liabilities
as well, as inflows of retail deposits were adequate to support lackluster
credit growth. Indeed, overall bank credit decreased slightly in May, after

remaining unchanged in April, as a contraction in loans for the second
straight month offset a buildup of U.S. government securities. The shifting
composition of bank asset flows is reminiscent of behavior around previous
business cycle troughs, when loan demand tended to lag the incipient revival
in economic activity, and banks were induced temporarily to invest retail
deposit inflows in securities. This cyclical swing from loans to securities
may have been augmented during the current business cycle by the increased
rate of asset securitizations, which has partly been prompted by pressures
on depositories' capital positions. Consumer loans, for example, which
contracted again in May, actually posted a modest increase when adjusted for
securitizations. Increased securitizations have also weakened growth of
real estate loans at banks, which expanded at a 4-3/4 percent in May.
Overall, real estate lending, though down sharply from the pace prevailing
through the middle of 1990, was the only component of bank loans to show
continual growth through the recession.
Business Finance
Aggregate borrowing by nonfinancial corporations appears to have slowed
somewhat from its reduced first-quarter pace, at least partly reflecting a
pickup in equity issuance and probably declining needs to finance inventory.
Borrowing has been concentrated in long-term markets. While new bond
offerings by nonfinancial firms in May and June were off somewhat from
April's extraordinary level--the highest in four years--issuance this
quarter still should exceed the first-quarter pace. Corporate treasurers
appear to have moved aggressively to lock in relatively favorable longer-
term rates and, in many instances, have used the proceeds to pay down

commercial paper. Outstanding commercial paper declined at nearly a 35
percent annual rate in May and dropped further in early June.
While most recent corporate offerings have been by investment-grade
firms, issuance in the junk bond market has reopened to some extent in the
past few months. Most recent junk issues have been near investment-grade
and have been concentrated in noncyclical industries such as food products.
Financial institutions also have been tapping capital markets heavily of
late, with a number of issues backed by credit cards and other receivables.
Issuance of asset-backed securities reached a record high in May and
remained strong in June.
Corporate bond spreads have narrowed further during the intermeeting
period, particularly over the past few weeks. As is typical of early
recovery periods, diminished concerns about credit quality have led to
tighter spreads over comparable Treasuries. Spreads on investment-grade
industrial and A-rated utility bonds have narrowed more than 50 basis points
since December and are now close to their levels in June 1990. The average
spread on financial issues also has narrowed considerably since year-end
but, at 104 basis points, is still high relative to a year ago when it was
73 basis points. Spreads on credit-card backed securities, which
experienced a runup of 65 basis points between October and February to over
120 basis points, are currently only about 75 basis points above Treasuries,
nearly as narrow as they were a year ago.
Most major stock market indexes are little changed over the
intermeeting period. The Dow Jones Industrials reached a record high of
3035 on June 3, but along with other major indexes, retreated with the
increase in Treasury bond yields the first week of June. The stock market

III-9
has been particularly receptive to initial public offerings, having absorbed
$2 billion of them in May, the strongest issuance since September 1987.
May's volume included $1.3 billion issued by nonfinancial corporations and
several issues by former LBOs.
Treasury and Sponsored-Agency Financing
The staff estimates a relatively small federal deficit of about
$17 billion in the second quarter, owing largely to seasonal tax inflows,
but also reflecting the slow pace of RTC activity. 1 The decline in the
deficit has not been matched by a commensurate reduction in marketable
borrowing, however, because the Treasury has continued building its cash
balance in anticipation of very large deficits over the next few quarters.
Marketable borrowing in the second quarter will raise about $38 billion
in new cash, with bills paying down $12 billion and coupons raising
$50 billion. Much of the pressure to increase the gross sizes of the
regular auctions was diminished by a 335-day, $16 billion cash management
bill auctioned in mid-May. Nevertheless, over the quarter, weekly bill
auctions have been increased on balance from $15.2 billion to $20.8 billion,
while coupon auctions have been raised as much as $750 million.
Available data indicate that outstanding debt of the government-
sponsored enterprises continued to shrink in April and May, keeping rate
spreads on new GSE debt over Treasury issues tight during the intermeeting
period. In late May, the Treasury sent the Congress a package of proposed
reforms intended to improve the safety and soundness of the GSEs. The

package, comprising three separate bills, would increase regulation of the
Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation, the Student Loan Marketing Association, and the Farm Credit
System. Treasury, however, did not propose any changes in the regulatory
structure for the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
To regulate FNMA and FHLMC, Treasury proposed establishing a separate,
arms-length bureau within the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
effective January 1, 1992. The two GSEs would be assessed fees to fund the
oversight office. In addition to legislatively mandated minimum leverage
ratios, minimum risk-based capital ratios would be established by the
director of the oversight office. Failure to meet the capital standards
would require a GSE to develop and implement a capital restoration plan, and
would allow the oversight office to limit a GSE's activities, assets and
liabilities, capital distributions, and executive compensation. However, a
GSE that received the highest investment grade rating from two private
credit-rating agencies would be exempt from the minimum risk-based capital
ratios.
The proposal would make Treasury itself the regulator of SLMA, with
authority and responsibility similar to that proposed for the oversight
office in HUD. For the FCS, Treasury's proposal would create an independent
Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation that would charge FCS banks risk-
based insurance premiums, which would replace the current statutory premium
formula. The proposal would also give explicit authority to the Farm Credit
Administration to regulate the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation.

III-12
Municipal Securities
Issuance of tax-exempt securities picked up in May and looks to be
strong in June. The increase in June owes to a sharp rise in short-term
volume, as both New York State and Los Angeles have come to market with
large issues of revenue anticipation notes. Long-term issuance in June,
although slightly below its pace in May, remains robust.
Over the intermeeting period, the rise in yields on municipal
securities of nearly 25 basis points reflected the heavy volume and the
general rise in long-term yields. Quality spreads widened only slightly in
the wake of the bankruptcy filing by Bridgeport, Connecticut, the largest
city ever to file for protection under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code.
Yields on uninsured Bridgeport bonds reportedly jumped 200 to 400 basis
points the day after the city filed, but the filing, which had been widely
discussed ahead of time, is expected to have only a limited effect on the
market as a whole.
Bridgeport's petition for relief followed three years of fiscal crisis.
The city chose bankruptcy rather than allowing its state-appointed financial
control board to force through an 18 percent increase in property taxes to
close the $12 million deficit projected for fiscal year 1992. Reportedly,
the primary purpose of the filing is to lower the city's high labor costs,
by drawing upon the bankruptcy court's power to reject collective bargaining
3agreements. In response to the filing, Standard & Poor's lowered ratings
2. The state of Connecticut opposes Bridgeport's filing, and a court date
has been set for mid-July to determine whether or not the petition will be
accepted.
3. Whereas Congress amended Chapter 11 to make such tactics more difficult
after Continental Air Lines employed bankruptcy to break its union contract
in 1983, it did not change Chapter 9.

on Bridgeport's $77.7 million of outstanding uninsured debt to CCC from BBB,
and Moody's dropped the city's ratings to B from Baa. Both agencies
retained triple-A ratings on the city's $100 million of insured debt. In
any event, none of Bridgeport's bonds are likely to default soon, if ever,
because the city's financial control board makes debt service payments
before turning over tax receipts to the city. Funds for the next debt
service, due in August, already have been placed in escrow.
Budget problems continue to plague states, as well as municipalities.
Over the intermeeting period, one state rated AAA by S&P, Maine, was
downgraded, and four of the remaining eight were listed as troubled, owing
to declines in key financial indicators and continued softness in local
economies.
After a considerable delay, the New York State budget finally was
passed by the legislature and signed by Governor Cuomo, incorporating nearly

III-14
$1 billion in line-item veto spending cuts. Among the items cut was about
$300 million in aid to New York City. These funds were included in the
city's plan to close its own fiscal 1992 gap. The impasse over the state's
budget had already delayed sufficiently the city's receipt of some proceeds
to force it to sell $1.2 billion in short-term notes; the sale prompted
S&P's downgrading of the city's short-term debt. Now, with the deadline for
the 1992 fiscal year rapidly approaching, a $3.5 billion budget deficit
remains. The city plans to raise property taxes, and is laying off more
than 5,000 city workers and is contemplating major cuts in city services.
New York City's fiscal problems have led investors to demand a large risk
premium to hold its securities. When the city came to market recently with
$600 million in long-term debt, yields on the bonds, although lower than
expected, were still nearly 150 basis points higher than similarly rated
tax-exempt instruments.
In June, legislation was passed in Pennsylvania creating an "inter-
governmental cooperation authority" empowered to approve Philadelphia's
financial plan and to issue long-term bonds to erase the city's fiscal 1991
and 1992 budget deficits, which currently total more than $250 million. The
legislation also allows Philadelphia to defer a payment to its municipal
pension fund due on June 30. That payment, as well as large debt service
payments coming due in July, had threatened to send the city into default.
In response to the legislation, S&P has suggested that an upgrade from the
current CCC rating may be forthcoming for the city's obligations.
Mortgage Markets
Available data suggest that mortgage debt growth may have edged up a
bit in the second quarter, consistent with the pickup in sales of new and

existing homes. In the first quarter, mortgage credit for all property
types grew at an estimated 4-1/2 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate.
Credit expansion was concentrated in loans on single-family properties,
which grew at about a 6-3/4 percent rate. Growth in multifamily mortgage
lending came to a halt, while commercial mortgage debt outstanding fell for
the second consecutive quarter. Limited data for the second quarter show
growth of real estate loans at commercial banks moving up slightly to about
a 4-1/2 percent annual rate in May, boosted in part by borrowing against
home equity lines of credit.
Issuance of federally related mortgage-backed pass-through securities
increased for the third consecutive month in April to a seasonally adjusted
$19.3 billion. Issuance of multiclass securities also has been running well
ahead of the first-quarter pace, as the steepness in the yield curve has led
to an increase in CMO arbitrage transactions. Most of the growth in pass-
through issuance is accounted for by fixed-rate securities, while ARM
issuance remains light. With initial rates on FRMs close to their lowest
levels of the past five years, the ARM share of loans closed remained low in
the first quarter, averaging about 20 percent, based on the Federal Housing
Finance Board's monthly interest rate survey. More recently, the initial
rate advantage of ARMs has widened to over 2 percentage points, which may
enhance ARM demand. In late 1988, the last time the FRM-ARM initial rate
spread was at its current level, ARMs accounted for 55 percent of
conventional loan originations (chart).
In other developments, recent reports indicate that delinquency rates
for home mortgages increased a bit in the first quarter for most property
types. According to seasonally adjusted data from the Mortgage Bankers

Association, the 30-day "all loan" delinquency rate rose .25 percentage
point in the first quarter to 4.95 percent, generally retracing the previous
quarter's decline. The proportion of single-family loans 60 days or more
past due, a measure of more serious payment problems, edged up .06
percentage point to 1.54 percent in the first quarter (chart). Despite
their recent upticks, both measures of payment difficulties remain well
below the averages of the past decade. At life insurance companies, the
delinquency rate on all types of mortgages rose to a series high of 4.68
percent in the first quarter; as in other recent quarters, loans on
commercial properties accounted for much of the increase.

The number of problem real estate loans also has been rising sharply at
commercial banks, where the average delinquency rate on all property types
in the first quarter was the highest rate in eight years. Delinquency rates
on construction and development loans in the first quarter far exceeded
those of other loan categories.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding registered a small increase in
April after four months of small declines (table). The revolving credit
component grew less rapidly than in March, but has apparently recovered from
the unusual weakness it displayed in the fourth quarter and early this year.
Turnarounds in the nonrevolving components from sharp declines in March to a
slight decline (auto credit) or a moderate increase ("all other" loans)
contributed to the modest rebound in the installment credit total in April.
The behavior of consumer credit in recent months, both before and
during the economic downswing, has been quite consistent with previous
cyclical experience. Typically, consumer credit growth has slowed
progressively in advance of a cyclical peak, before sliding to a negative
rate sometime during the ensuing recession. Past upturns in consumer credit
usually have begun at or shortly before the onset of economic expansion.
Interest rates on consumer loans (other than credit cards) at
commercial banks declined about 1/4 percentage point in early May from
levels recorded in the February survey. Up to that time, declines in
consumer rates had been shallow relative to yields on other instruments of
comparable maturity. Early this year, the spreads between rates on consumer
loans and the yield on 2-year Treasury securities were around their widest
levels in the 15-year period they have been calculated. The widening in the

spreads mainly reflected typical lags in adjustment of consumer rates to
movements in market rates, but also efforts by banks to protect against loan
losses during a period of economic slowdown.
Increases in delinquency rates on consumer loans in the first quarter,
though moderate in some cases (chart), likely fueled such concerns.
According to the American Bankers Association, the average delinquency rate
on closed-end consumer loans at banks reached a level close to, but still
somewhat below, the highs of the 1973-75 and 1980-82 recession periods.
Delinquencies on automobile loans at the "captive" auto finance companies
also were near previous highs in the first quarter, although they increased
only slightly during the quarter. Previous patterns suggest that both
series may register sharp declines as the turnaround in economic activity
continues.
Delinquencies on bank credit cards have climbed much more steeply over
the past year than have these other series. As measured by the ABA, the
credit card delinquency rate jumped .40 percentage points to 3.19 percent,
more than one percentage point above its recent low in 1989-Q4. To some
extent, the upsurge reflects an earlier relaxation of credit standards by
card-issuing banks intent on expanding card programs that had become highly
profitable by the mid-1980s. In particular, large issuers with nationwide
distribution have been following a strategy of making cards available to
higher-risk individuals and charging higher than average interest rates.
Many of these large issuers also have been active in securitizing parts
of their credit card portfolios. The higher delinquency rates at these
issuers are evident in a series prepared by Moody's, showing the average
rate for credit card accounts that have been pooled as backing for

III-22
securities. At an average of 6.2 percent in the first quarter, it was about
double the rate estimated by the ABA for banks in general. 4Like the ABA
series, Moody's index has experienced a sharp rise recently, climbing from
4.0 percent in the spring of 1989.
4. The gap between the two series is also partly explained by differing
methods of calculation: the Moody's series is based on dollar amounts of
delinquent and total loans, and the ABA series is based on numbers of loans.
Because delinquent balances are typically larger than the average balance
for a given portfolio, a dollar-based delinquency rate would be higher than
a number-based rate for the same set of accounts.

U.S. Merchandise Trade
In April, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was $4.8 billion
(seasonally adjusted, Census basis), slightly larger than the revised March
deficit of $4.1 billion, but smaller than the average for the first quarter.
The value of both exports and imports rose in April; exports were 5 percent,
and imports 2 percent, above the first-quarter average.
For exports, the increase in April was primarily in capital goods and
automotive products (in both categories it was the second consecutive month
of expansion from low levels recorded earlier in the year). There was also
a pick up in a broad range of exported industrial supplies. Agricultural
exports were little changed from the average levels of the past year.

products increased slightly as rising deliveries from Canada (from low
levels recorded in January-February) were about offset by a drop in
shipments from Japan. Oil imports also rose slightly in value, as a 13
percent rise in volume was largely offset by a 50 cent per barrel decline in
the price of imported oil.
In 1991-Q1 the merchandise trade deficit was substantially smaller
than in previous quarters, resulting almost entirely from a $36 billion (7
percent) drop in the value of imports, split about equally between oil and

quantity reflecting weakening U.S. demand; one exception was imports of
computers and parts, which continued to move up. While there was little
change in value of exports between the fourth and first quarters, quantity
expanded at a 7 percent annual rate (primarily computers, industrial
supplies, and agricultural products). Both exports and imports of
automotive products fell in the first quarter, reflecting primarily sagging
sales in the United States.

Oil Imports: Quantities and Prices.
The pace of oil imports (mb/d) picked up slightly in the first
quarter, but remained well below rates recorded in the first three quarters
of 1990. Continued stock drawdowns (especially in January) and weak
economic activity restrained imports. In April, oil imports increased to
7.9 mb/d, largely the result of stockbuilding; this was the first increase
in stocks since September of last year. Weekly indicators suggest that oil
imports increased again in May as stocks continued to be rebuilt at a rapid
pace.
From a peak in November 1990, the price of oil dropped nearly $12 per
barrel to average about $17.90 per barrel in both March and April. Spot

prices point to a modest increase (about $0.60 per barrel) in import prices
in May. In June, spot prices of West Texas Intermediate crude oil have
fallen about $1.00 per barrel. The decline occurred as stocks continued to
rise in late May and early June, and in the absence of a cut in production
quotas at the June 4th OPEC meeting.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
The fixed-weight price index for non-oil imports, reported in the GNP
accounts, rose 4.0 percent at an annual rate during the first quarter, a
slightly slower rate of increase than recorded during the fourth quarter.
The deceleration in prices was evident in most major end-use groupings, and

likely reflects, in part, the shift in the dollar from depreciation during
the fourth quarter to a moderate appreciation on balance during the first
quarter. With the continued rise in the dollar, prices of most major trade
categories of non-oil imports declined in April, especially prices of
imported capital goods.
Prices of agricultural exports moved up 7.8 percent at an annual rate
in the first quarter, led by increases in the prices of exported fruits,
feedgrains, and rice. In contrast, the average price of nonagricultural
exports declined, as price increases for exported capital goods, consumer
goods, and automotive products were more than offset by declines in the
prices of exported industrial supplies. In April, the price index for
nonagricultural exports fell 0.2 percent (not at an annual rate), its third
consecutive monthly decrease, led by a continuing fall in the index for
industrial supplies (especially fuels, chemicals, and paper). This decline
was offset, however, by a 1.0 increase in prices for agricultural exports
(especially wheat).
BLS import and export prices for May will be released on June 27 and
will be discussed in the Greenbook supplement.
U.S. Current Account through 1991-Q1
The U.S. current account shifted to a surplus of $40.9 billion SAAR in
the first quarter of 1991 from a revised deficit of $93.6 billion SAAR in
the fourth quarter of 1990. (See the tables below.) The change resulted
from two factors: a $104 billion shift in unilateral transfers from net
payments to net receipts (largely reflecting cash contributions from
coalition partners in Operation Desert Storm), and a $29 billion decrease in
the deficit on goods, services, and investment income (primarily a drop in
merchandise imports).

Cash contributions from coalition partners in Operation Desert Storm
amounted to $22.7 billion (not an annual rate) in the first quarter,
compared with $4.3 billion (not an annual rate) in the fourth quarter. In
addition, data for the fourth quarter included a $7 billion U.S. government
grant to Egypt to repay debt to the United States ($2.1 billion for interest
payments and $4.9 billion for repayment of principal). Excluding the cash
contributions and the special grant to Egypt, the current account moved from
a deficit of $82.8 billion in the fourth quarter to a deficit of $49.9
billion in the first quarter.
The merchandise trade deficit narrowed $37.4 billion SAAR in the first
quarter. The level of exports was about the same as in the fourth quarter;
about half of the drop in imports was in the value of oil.
Net service receipts declined slightly in the first quarter from a
high fourth-quarter level. Most of the change was in travel and passenger
fares; U.S. receipts from foreigners fell more than U.S. payments to
foreigners during the war in the Middle East. Both exports and imports of
military goods and services declined a bit from strong fourth-quarter
levels, leaving the balance little changed.
Net portfolio income (excluding transactions related to the
forgiveness of Egyptian debt) strengthened $3.5 billion SAAR in the first
quarter; the general decline in interest rates reduced payments on our net
liability position.
Net direct investment income declined in the first quarter. This
small decline was the net of the elimination of large fourth-quarter losses
reported by foreign direct investors in the United States (which raised U.S.
payments) and a substantial increase in income receipts from U.S. direct
investments abroad. The losses reported by foreign investors in the fourth
quarter were largely by banking and finance companies. Although U.S. direct

IV-10
investment payments to foreigners shifted from losses to profits in the
first quarter, they remained at a depressed level (near zero) as the U.S.
recession held down profits. U.S. income receipts on direct investments
abroad were strong in the fourth quarter and increased further in the first
quarter, partly reflecting transitory positive effects of the Persian Gulf
crisis on the earnings of U.S. oil companies abroad.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
In the first quarter of 1991, recorded net capital inflows and a
current account surplus (line 9 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table) combined to produce a large negative statistical
discrepancy (line 10) in the U.S. international transactions accounts.
Foreign official holdings of reserve assets in the United States (line
4) increased by about $6 billion in the first quarter, despite large
payments by a number of countries to cover the costs of Desert Storm. While
payments by Germany and Japan reduced their assets held in the United
States, holdings of the OPEC countries in the United States did not decline.
Official assets in the United States of "other" countries increased sharply;
about one-third was accounted for by Spain, and most of the rest was
contributed by Singapore, Taiwan, and Mexico. In April, foreign official
reserves in the United States declined about $6 billion, but preliminary
information from the FRBNY indicates that the decline was reversed in May.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities (lines 2a, 2b, and 3)
were about matched by U.S. net purchases of foreign securities (line 2c) in
the first quarter. In April, however, there was a small net capital inflow
as the result of private securities transactions. In both March and April,
foreigners added to their holdings of U.S. stocks (line 2b), the first
substantial increases since October 1989.

Capital outflows associated with U.S. direct investment abroad (line
6) were very strong in the first quarter of 1991. The bulk of the
investments were in the countries of the European Community. The capital
inflows associated with foreign direct investment in the United States (line
7) fell further in the first quarter from the depressed 1990-fourth quarter
level. BEA revised the inflow for the year 1990 up to $37 billion (compared
with the earlier estimate of $26 billion), but it remained far below the $71
billion reached in 1989. A shift in financing patterns appears to be the
major explanation for this dramatic decline; according to data recently
released by BEA, outlays by foreign direct investors to acquire U.S.
businesses declined by only $3 billion, from $60 billion in 1989 to $57
billion in 1990. Apparently, a far smaller fraction of the financing was
provided by foreign parent companies in 1990, and a larger fraction by
borrowing by U.S. affiliates of foreign direct investors. Data on foreign
acquisitions of U.S. businesses in 1991 are not yet available, so it is not
possible to judge whether the depressed level of capital inflows in the
first quarter of 1991 reflects a continuation of 1990 financing patterns or
whether it indicates a significant decline in the rate at which foreigners
are acquiring U.S. businesses.
Banks reported small net inflows in the first quarter, but large net
outflows in April (line 1). In contrast, monthly average data on banks' net
claims on their own foreign offices and IBFs are far less volatile (line 1
of the International Banking Data table). The volatility of reported bank
flows on a last-day-of-the-month basis, and the large swings in the
statistical discrepancy in the international transactions accounts, suggest
that there may be problems in the reporting of transactions that occur at
the end of quarters; either the counterpart to window dressing that occurs
at the end of some quarters is not reported in the balance of payments

accounts or the two sides of the transaction are reported in different
quarters. While these reporting problems may be a source of swings in the
discrepancy, as in the first quarter, they would not explain the cumulative
positive statistical discrepancy in recent decades.
The U.S. International Investment Position
BEA recently released revised estimates of the U.S. net international
investment position for 1982 to 1989. Data for 1990 are scheduled to be
released at the end of June. Last year BEA ceased publishing gross totals
for U.S. assets abroad and foreign assets in the United States; they argued
that, because some components of the investment position were measured at
historical cost (particularly direct investment) while others were measured
at current market value, adding components based upon such a mix of
valuations would not provide a useful indicator of the level of the
investment position.
Over the past year, BEA has developed alternative estimates of the
value of direct investment assets. In addition to book value (the old
measure, based largely on historical cost), BEA has made two new estimates.
One is based on the current replacement cost of U.S. and foreign direct
investors' share in their affiliates' investments in tangible assets --
property, plant, equipment, and inventories. The other is based on the
stock market value of U.S. and foreign parents' share of equity in their
direct investment affiliates. In addition, BEA has revalued gold held in
U.S. reserves to the market price.
BEA now estimates that the U.S. net international investment position
was between -$281 billion and -$464 billion at the end of 1989 and that the
position deteriorated by anywhere from $540 billion to $828 billion between
the end of 1982 and the end of 1989. These estimates are based on recorded
capital flows and valuation changes only and take no account of the

IV-15
statistical discrepancy in the U.S. international transactions accounts,
which cumulated to about $175 billion in the years 1960 to 1989. The
negative U.S. net investment position is understated to the extent that part
of the cumulative statistical discrepancy is explained by unrecorded net
capital inflows.
Movements in the net international investment position are of interest
largely as a crude indicator of future servicing burden and as a component
of national wealth. However, because rates of return on various components
differ, the composition and gross level of U.S. assets abroad and foreign
assets in the United States influence investment income as well; movements
in the net investment position are likely to indicate the direction of
change in net investment income, but not the level. U.S. net investment
income is currently around zero despite the large negative net investment
position.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average value of the dollar moved up about 4-1/4 percent
since the May 14 FOMC meeting. Early in the intermeeting period, the dollar
rose sharply but briefly against the mark as market participants readjusted
their portfolios following Sweden's announcement on May 17 that it would peg
the krona to the ECU. Subsequent data releases suggesting that U.S.
economic activity may have begun to turn around pushed the dollar higher.
The dollar rose more than 5-1/4 percent on balance against the mark,
reaching a high of DM 1.8190 on June 24 in early Far Eastern trading. In
contrast, the dollar edged up about 1/4 percent against the yen on balance
during the period, although it had been higher--around ¥ 142--in early June.
Near the end of the intermeeting period, the dollar declined a bit amid
uncertainty about the implications for exchange rate policy of the June 23
G-7 meeting in London.

IV-16
Changes in interest rate differentials reflected the bilateral
currency movements. While short-term and long-term interest rates in the
United States moved higher during the period, comparable interest rates in
Germany moved slightly lower, even though the Bundesbank shifted to
variable-rate repurchase operations at the beginning of June and nudged up
the minimum rate in these operations. The three-month interbank rate in
Germany declined 10 basis points since the May 14 meeting, and the
bellwether bond yield edged down about 5 basis points. In contrast, the
yield on the bellwether bond in Japan rose more than 15 basis points, nearly
matching the increase in the comparable U.S. yield, and the three-month CD
rate in Japan moved up 12 basis points. First-quarter GNP growth was strong
in Japan, and that, combined with expressed concerns over the weakness of
the yen against the dollar, led market participants to expect that the Bank
of Japan may delay easing a while longer.
The dollar's rise prompted intervention sales of dollars on two days
by the Bank of Japan
The Desk did
not intervene during the period.
During most of the period, the Spanish peseta remained near its
6-percent intervention limit with respect to the French franc in the
exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. Even after Spanish short-term interest
rates declined, as authorities reduced the official repurchase rate 3/4
percentage point, the French franc failed to gain ground against the peseta.
Weighing on the franc were concerns about the direction of policy in France
under the new Prime Minister.

interest rates to move up. While the three-month rate in Spain declined
nearly 60 basis points during the period to about 12-1/2 percent, the
comparable rate in France rose 80 basis points to 9-7/8. Later in the
period, pressure on the peseta-franc spread eased amid expectations that a
proposed Spanish government wage pact, if enacted, might produce a sharp
reduction in inflation and interest rates, and speed the peseta's entry into
the group of narrow-band currencies. Prospects for the wage pact now appear
to be bleak, and the peseta-franc spread rebounded somewhat, though it is
still below the 6-percent limit.
Sterling declined 6-1/2 percent against the dollar and more than 1
percent against the mark since the May FOMC meeting. Contributing to the
decline were increasing uncertainties about the political future of the
Conservative Party as the recession persists and progress on inflation
remains slow. Several reports during the period showed the Labour Party
with a significant lead in the polls. Perhaps partly in response to these
political pressures, U.K. authorities reduced money-market dealing rates
another 1/2 percentage point in May, and the U.K. three-month interbank
interest rate declined nearly as much during the period to end at about 11-
1/4 percent. The yield on the bellwether bond in the United Kingdom rose
almost 40 basis points to more than 10-1/2 percent, possibly reflecting an
increase in inflation expectations.

IV-19
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Signs of a strengthening in economic activity in the major industrial
countries have been mixed. Large increases in German and Japanese GDP
occurred in the first quarter. They were partly due to special factors, and
there have been signs of weakness in some second quarter monthly indicators.
First-quarter GDP declined in Canada and United Kingdom, although Canada is
showing some signs of a second-quarter recovery. First-quarter activity in
France and Italy is likely to have been flat, but there have been some
tentative signs of recovery in the second quarter.
Inflation was stable or declined in most industrial countries except
Germany. In the United Kingdom, measured inflation continued to decline,
reflecting the effect of lower mortgage interest rates on the retail price
index. In Italy and Canada, inflation appears to be slowing following
recent increases in indirect taxes.
German unification has continued to influence the pattern of external
imbalances within Europe. Germany's trade and current account balances
deteriorated sharply in the first quarter, with payments related to the Gulf
war contributing to a current account deficit. First-quarter improvements
in trade balances in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom were partly due
to substantial increases in exports to Germany. Japan's trade surplus in
May declined slightly, but remained well above its level last year.
Individual Country Notes. Recent evidence on the pace of economic
activity in Japan has been mixed. Real GNP (s.a.a.r.) increased 11.2
percent in the first quarter. Domestic demand increased 5.1 percent, while
consumption registered a more moderate 3.1 percent increase. Plant and
equipment investment registered a strong 11 percent increase, while housing
investment declined a further 10.9 percent. Inventory investment made a
positive 1.3 percent contribution to growth, following a 2.1 percent

negative contribution in the previous quarter. Net exports made a strong
5.9 percent positive contribution to growth, boosted by several temporary
factors, in particularly a surge in income from foreign assets, a drop in
the travel deficit, and a 25 percent increase in exports that is partly due
to a change in the seasonal pattern of auto exports. A decline in imports
of 9 percent also contributed.
Monthly indicators of economic activity suggest less underlying
strength. The index of leading indicators (s.a.) signaled a weakening
economy for the eighth consecutive month in April. Housing starts (s.a.)
dropped sharply for the third consecutive month in April and were 16.2
percent lower than in December last year. The number of corporate
bankruptcies (s.a.) rose for the fourth consecutive month in May, and were
25.2 percent above their level of last December. Retail sales (s.a.)
declined 0.3 percent in April. The capacity utilization rate (s.a.) rose
1.8 percent in April, but remains 2.9 percent below its peak level last
October. Industrial production (s.a.) increased by 1.7 percent in May, but
was still only 1.1 percent above its level of last December. Labor market
conditions remain tight; the unemployment rate (s.a.) eased to 2.1 percent
in April, only slightly above the 10-year low of 2 percent reached in
February.
Inflationary pressures appear to have eased somewhat in recent months.
The consumer price index for the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) was 3 percent above its
level a year earlier, down from the previous month. Wholesale prices
(n.s.a.) in May were only 0.6 percent above their level a year earlier.
Wholesale prices have been held down until recently by falling import prices
(n.s.a.), which fell 12 percent since December, reflecting, in large part,
lower oil prices. The recently completed "shunto" spring wage round

IV-24
resulted in average wage agreements of 5.6 percent, down slightly from 5.9
percent last year.
The trade surplus (s.a.) declined in May to $5.8 billion from $6
billion in the previous month. Through the first five months of this year,
the cumulative trade surplus was $70.1 billion (a.r.), well above the $53.1
billion surplus rate in the same period last year.
Real GNP in western Germany (s.a.a.r.) increased 9.7 percent in the
first quarter. Another mild winter caused seasonally adjusted construction
investment to increase 87.5 percent in the first quarter. The strong first
quarter also reflects a continuation of the factors that accelerated growth
in the second half of 1990, as virtually all elements of final domestic
demand increased strongly. Private consumption increased 9.5 percent, and
equipment investment increased 31.5 percent. Public consumption fell 10.5
percent in the first quarter due to a change in reporting concepts in the
west German national accounts. Government expenditure for eastern Germany
was shifted from the category of government consumption to exports (no
corrections were made to previous data). West German net exports were up
sharply in the first quarter, due only in part to the reporting change,
increasing the growth of total GNP in the first quarter by 4.2 percentage
points. A sharp decline in inventory accumulation reduced the growth of
total GNP by 8.3 percentage points.
Industrial production (s.a.) in western Germany fell 1.8 percent in
April to a level 1.5 percent below the average for the first quarter. The
largest component of the April decline was a 7.9 percent decline in
seasonally adjusted construction activity.
The volume of new orders for west German manufactured goods (s.a.)
fell 3.6 percent in April. Total orders have now declined 3.5 percent since
the beginning of the year. Foreign orders have marginally out performed

IV-25
domestic orders in both March and April, reversing earlier trends. In April
the volume of retail sales (s.a.) in western Germany increased 0.2 percent,
after increasing 1.7 percent in March. The west German unemployment rate
(s.a.) increased 0.1 percent in May to 6.3 percent, the first increase since
1989.
Industrial production in eastern Germany (n.s.a.) fell 24 percent in
January and 1 percent in February, to a level 38 percent of the average
level in 1989. Official east German unemployment (n.s.a.) was unchanged in
May at 9.5 percent. The number of workers engaged in government subsidized
"short-time" work (n.s.a.) fell 0.6 percent in May to 22.1 percent of the
labor force.
West German consumer prices (n.s.a.) increased 2.9 percent in May from
their level a year earlier, up from 2.8 percent in April. West German
wholesale prices (n.s.a.) increased 1.3 percent in May from their level a
year earlier, up from 1 percent in April. West German import prices were
unchanged in May, after increasing 1.1 percent in April. On a year/year
basis import prices were unchanged in March, but in May they were up 2.7
percent.
The combined German current account (n.s.a.a.r.) improved in April due
largely to a decline in payments related to the Gulf War. The current
account deficit was $19 billion in April, compared with $23 billion for the
first quarter. Excluding payments related to the Gulf War the German current
account showed a surplus of $5 billion in the first quarter, compared with a
surplus of $47 billion for 1990 as a whole. The combined German trade
balance (n.s.a.a.r.) ran a deficit in April of $9.8 billion. (The last time
western Germany had a monthly trade deficit was in the early 1980s.) This

IV-26
compares with a first-quarter surplus of $17.6 billion and a surplus of $65
billion for all of 1990. In April exports (n.s.a.) were down 12 percent
relative to the first quarter, while imports (n.s.a.) fell only 5.9 percent.
The Bundesbank announced that M3 (s.a.) in western and eastern Germany
had increased 3.5 percent through May relative to the fourth quarter, up
from 3.4 percent for April. Although the May figure is below the 1991
target of 4 to 6 percent M3 growth, it appears that the low level of
economic activity in eastern Germany, and the gradual portfolio shifts into
previously unavailable long-term assets are depressing monetary growth in
eastern Germany, and, consequently, the overall measure.
Recent data confirm that activity in France stagnated in the first
quarter. Marketable GDP (s.a.), an early indicator of total GDP that
excludes most government services, was unchanged. Consumption and inventory
accumulation expanded, while exports and fixed investment contracted.
Early indicators for the second quarter are mixed. Industrial
production (s.a.) grew 3.2 percent in April, after declining in March, but
household consumption (s.a.) of manufactured products fell 0.9 percent.
Business confidence, measured by near-term industrial production plans
(s.a.), rose for the third consecutive month in May.
French consumer inflation remains moderate. The CPI was up 3.2
percent on a twelve-month basis in May, the same as in April. The
differential with German inflation narrowed to 0.3 percentage points in May.
Prime Minister Rocard resigned in May and was replaced by Edith
Cresson, who assumes leadership of the minority Socialist government. The
government remains intent on hitting its 1991 budget deficit target of FF80
billion ($13 billion equivalent). In the face of slow revenue growth and
unexpected expansion in expenditures, it announced plans at the end of May
for spending cuts, tax increases, and one-time levies totaling FF16 billion.

IV-27
In Italy, signs of a recovery in economic activity, following a
stagnant first quarter, are mixed. Industrial production (s.a.) declined
2.1 percent in April, after a slight increase of 0.3 percent in the first
quarter. However, unemployment (n.s.a.) declined in April to 10.9 percent
from 11.3 percent in January and was below its level of a year earlier.
Consumer prices (n.s.a.) increased 6.8 percent in May from:their level
a year earlier, roughly the same as the increase in the previous month.
This high level of inflation, up from 5.6 percent a year ago, reflect the
effect of recent increases in indirect taxes and administered prices. In
contrast, wholesale and producer price inflation declined in April, with
wholesale prices (n.s.a.) rising 7.2 percent, down from 8.6 percent in
March. Producer prices (n.s.a.) rose only 4 percent in April from their
level a year earlier, down from 4.1 percent in March.
The trade deficit (s.a.) increased sharply in April, to $1.8 billion,
exceeding the $1.3 billion deficit for the entire first quarter. This
deterioration should prove temporary, as it results from a surge in imports
following a customs strike in March.
In the United Kingdom, the average measure of real GDP (s.a.) declined
by 2.5 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter. Consumption increased at a 1.6
percent rate, following two consecutive quarters of decline. However, fixed
private investment remained very weak, falling a further 11.7 percent. Net
exports made a small negative contribution to growth. Preliminary
indications are that the recession continued into the second quarter.
Industrial production declined 2.7 percent in April. The volume of retail
sales (s.a.) declined by 0.3 percent in May. The unemployment rate (s.a.)
increased to 7.9 percent in May, the tenth consecutive monthly rise.
Recent data show some easing of inflation. The retail price index
(n.s.a.) rose only 0.2 percent in May, and on a 12-month basis the increase

IV-28
was 5.6 percent, down sharply from 9.3 percent at the end of last year.
Excluding mortgage interest payments, the 12-month increase in the index was
6.6 percent. Output prices for manufactured goods (n.s.a.) rose 6 percent
in May from their year-earlier level.
The current account deficit (s.a.) decreased in May to $0.9 billion.
Through the first five months of this year, this deficit was $10.1 billion,
down sharply from the $31.9 billion deficit over the corresponding period
last year.
First-quarter GDP (s.a.a.r.) fell 4.8 percent in Canada, extending the
recession to a full calender year. All components except government
expenditures fell. However, several recent indicators suggest a recovery is
beginning. Retail sales (s.a.) rose 0.4 percent in April. Housing starts
(s.a.), which have been at very low levels, increased for the third
consecutive month in May, rising 16.4 percent from the previous month.
Motor vehicle sales (s.a.) rose 6.8 percent in April. Manufacturers'
shipments (s.a.) increased 2.2 percent in April following a 0.5 percent rise
in March. New orders (s.a.) jumped 5 percent in April, and unfilled orders
(s.a.) rose for the first time since August 1990. Unemployment (s.a.)
dropped to 10.3 percent in April from a recent peak of 10.5 percent in
February.
Consumer prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.5 percent in May to a year-over-
year rate of 6.2 percent, the same as the core rate that excludes food and
energy. Canada's current account deficit (s.a.) stood at $4.7 billion in
the first quarter.
Developments in East European Economies.
High and rising unemployment shows signs of interfering with economic
reform programs in Eastern Europe. In Poland, members of the Solidarity
labor union are becoming increasingly restive. The CSFR, where unemployment

IV-29
in certain regions of Slovakia is more than double the national average,
witnessed the downfall of Slovakian Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar who had
threatened to march on Bratislava with the unemployed. Hungary faces
different concerns, as problems with Soviet payments detract from an
otherwise positive trade picture.
In Poland, industrial output continued to contract 4.8 percent in May
and 8.6 percent since the beginning of the year. Inflation may be
responding to tight policies, as the monthly rate fell to 2.7 percent in
April (almost half the March figure and one of the lowest monthly inflation
rates since the beginning of the stabilization program in January 1990).
The Polish National Bank announced a cut in interest rates from 72 percent
to 59 percent, which yields a positive real rate of around 10 percent.
Government spending has expanded in an effort to revive economic activity,
and the budget deficit through April exceeds IMF targets.
Poland devalued the zloty by 14.4 percent in May, the first change in
the exchange rate since it was pegged, on January 1, 1990, at the beginning
of the stabilization program. Exports increased 30 percent in May from
April, yielding the first monthly trade surplus in 1991 of $159 million.
For the year through May, the trade deficit stands at $367 million.
April inflation in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic decreased to
2 percent, down from 4 percent in March. The monthly inflation rate has
fallen each month since the initial 25 percent increase in the price level
at the start of the reform program in January 1991.
Industrial production declined 13 percent over the first four months
of 1991 compared with the same period in 1990. In an effort to restart
production, the State Bank reduced the maximum surcharge that commercial
banks may charge over the 10 percent discount rate.

IV-30
The balance of payments deficit for the first quarter totaled $300
million. While total trade has contracted since the first quarter of 1990
(exports and imports fell 22 and 17 percent, respectively), trade with
market economies increased 7.7 percent to 57 percent of total trade. The
CSFR reforms are being supported by an ECU 375 million loan from the
European Community to strengthen foreign currency reserves. The loan is the
EC's share of a $1 billion G-24 package.
Unemployment in Hungary, although still expected to rise, decreased
slightly in May to a rate of 3.4 percent. Industrial production for firms
employing more than 50 workers dropped 19.9 percent in April from its level
a year earlier. The seeming inconsistency between the unemployment figures
and the industrial production figures could indicate either that firms are
hoarding labor or that workers are moving into small enterprises in the
private sector.
Hungary's convertible currency current account surplus totaled $159
million in the first quarter, fueled by strong exports and tourism. Exports
to traditional Western markets nearly doubled, offsetting a 50 percent
decline in exports to CMEA countries. Lagging trade payments from the
Soviet Union are a developing concern; of $500 million in exports delivered,
only $100 million have been paid for. In contrast, Hungary has paid $400
million to the U.S.S.R. for imports though the end of May.
Monthly inflation decreased slightly in April to 2.4 percent although
the annual rate is still over 35 percent. Given the strong export
performance, Central Bank President Gyorgy Suranyi has suggested a possible
revaluation of the forint to ease inflationary pressures.
Economic situation in other countries
The Brazilian Senate approved on June 19 the agreement with bank
creditors reached in April to restructure $8 billion in interest arrears.

IV-31
Brazil now seeks a Brady-style debt-reduction plan for its remaining $60
billion commercial bank debt. Mexican interest rates declined further as
U.S. Congressional approval of fast-track procedures for the proposed North
American Free Trade Agreement spurred investor confidence. In Argentina,
inflation has continued to decline in response to the stabilization measures
announced in March, but additional fiscal adjustment is needed. In
Venezuela, a loosening of fiscal policy has led to increased inflation and
failure to qualify for the 1991-Q1 drawing on its IMF Extended Fund
Facility. In Korea, real GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was 9.1 percent
above its year-earlier level, accompanied by a sharp rise in the current
account deficit. Taiwan's economic growth also appears to be recovering
from its 1990 slowdown.
Individual Country Notes. On June 19, Brazil's $8 billion interest
arrears agreement, reached with creditor banks in April, was approved by the
Brazilian Senate, as required by the Constitution. The new economic team
headed by former Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Marques Moreira
announced intentions to speed progress on negotiations on Brazil's remaining
estimated $60 billion debt owed to foreign commercial banks. Minister
Moreira also wants a Brady-style debt-reduction plan, which will require IMF
support. It is anticipated that negotiations on an IMF program will begin
shortly. However, the government has not yet introduced proposals necessary
for fiscal reform, which should be an integral component of an IMF program.
The government reported a 1990 operational surplus equal to 1.2 percent of
GDP, compared with an operational deficit as high as 7.8 percent of GDP in
1989, but most of that improvement was due to one-time government revenue
gains from a freeze of bank assets in March 1990.
There are indications that economic activity is recovering from the
steep recession over the past year. Industrial output rose 13 percent

IV-32
between March and April, but remains at a low level. Despite the imposition
of price controls in January, inflation was over 5 percent in April and
almost 7 percent in May. It is expected to be 9 percent in June. The
government announced that it will phase out the controls over the next
month.
Brazil's trade surplus for the first five months of 1991 was $6.2
billion, compared with $4.7 billion over the same period in 1990. The
spread between the official and parallel market exchange rates has been
steady at about 11 percent in recent weeks.
Mexican interest rates fell sharply in May, as the U.S. Congress moved
toward approval of fast-track procedures for the proposed North American
Free Trade Agreement, and fell further in early June after approval was
secured. At the June 18 auction of Mexican Treasury securities, the rate
for 28-day bills was 17.51 percent, down 373 basis points from April 23.
The decline reflected not only the growing capital inflows that are being
stimulated, in part, by the prospects of successful free trade negotiations
but also the slowing of inflation. The CPI rose by only 1 percent in both
April and May, down from 1.7 percent in February and 1.4 percent in March,
and the June increase is widely expected to be 1 percent as well. The
Mexican authorities are sterilizing only a part of the reserve gains derived
from the capital inflows, being concerned that sterilizing most or all of
them would raise interest rates, increase the government's indebtedness, and
therefore increase the cost of servicing the internal public debt.
The first quarter trade results show that, in comparison with a year
earlier, imports were up by 37 percent, with increases spread across all
categories of goods. In part, this growth reflects the relatively low level
of imports in the first quarter of 1990, which were followed by relatively
high imports and inventory accumulation in the third and fourth quarters.

IV-33
Therefore, the year-over-year growth of imports is likely to decline during
the balance of 1991 as inventories are reduced. First quarter exports grew
only 6 percent above their year-earlier level, but manufactured exports were
up by 14 percent.
In May and early June, the government sold more than 1.7 billion
shares of TELMEX, the telephone system, in the U.S., Japanese, and European
stock markets for a total $2.27 billion. This amount was added to the
contingency fund held by the Mexican authorities as a cushion against future
balance-of-payments problems, bringing its total to more than $4 billion.
The contingency fund is not included in the officially reported reserves of
Mexico.
On June 10, the Finance Secretariat accepted the bid of Grupo
Financiero Probursa, a brokerage house, to purchase 77.2 percent of the
shares of Multibanco Mercantil de Mexico for the peso equivalent of about
$200 million, 2.66 times book value. This was the first of the nationalized
commercial banks to be privatized. The sale of 100 percent of the shares of
a second bank for the equivalent of about $182 million, more than 3 times
book value, was announced on June 17.
In Argentina, financial markets continue to be stable following the
legal fixing of the exchange rate to the dollar in late March. The
expectation that the authorities will be able to maintain the fixed exchange
rate, if only for the next few months, has boosted the demand for austral-
denominated assets. To keep the austral from appreciating, the authorities
purchased $544 million in the foreign exchange market in May and have
purchased over $200 million thus far in June. Short-term call money rates
of interest have registered roughly 2 percent (monthly basis) in recent
weeks, extremely low by the standards of the past few decades. Consumer

inflation has continued to decline, falling to 2.8 percent (monthly basis)
in May from 5.5 percent in April.
After running fiscal deficits, excluding interest payments, for the
first quarter of 1991, the government has achieved estimated surpluses
equivalent to between $100 million and $150 million in April and May.
However, these fall short of the roughly $300 million surplus required
monthly to finance its debt-service obligations. As a stop-gap measure, the
government sought Congressional approval to spread the twice-yearly bonus
for public sector workers, equal to a half-month's salary and scheduled for
June, across the second half of 1991. However, heavy political opposition
forced the government to withdraw the proposed legislation. The government
also has initiated tax reform legislation that will strengthen the powers of
the tax collection agency, as well as encourage the return of flight
capital.
Talks with the IMF are continuing on a new program to replace the
stand-by arrangement that became inoperative at the beginning of the year.
However, IMF concerns that the adjustment measures proposed by Argentina are
insufficient to close its fiscal gap have slowed negotiations. Executive
Board approval of a stand-by will not be forthcoming until late July at the
earliest.
Monthly consumer price inflation in Venezuela averaged 2.6 percent in
April and May, up from an average of 1.9 percent in the first three months
of 1991. This increase is mainly due to robust economic growth spurred by a
fiscal expansion and led by public sector investment. In an attempt to
contain the rise in prices, the Venezuelan central bank has maintained a
relatively tight monetary policy in recent months. The level of M2
increased an average of 1.8 percent per month in the first third of 1991,
compared with 5.4 percent per month in the last half of 1990. This slower

IV-35
growth in liquidity helped to push the average bank lending interest rate
from 29.8 percent in December 1990 to 36.8 percent in April.
Having failed to implement a promised value-added tax, Venezuela was
not permitted to make the 1991-Q1 drawing under its IMF Extended Fund
Facility. As a consequence, Venezuela had to seek waivers from the
commercial banks supplying new money under last year's financing package in
order for the second new money tranche to be released. The necessary two-
thirds majority of the banks agreed to provide the waivers, allowing the
$300 million in new money to be disbursed.
In Korea, real GDP increased 9.1 percent in the first quarter of 1991
over the first quarter in 1990. First-quarter growth continued to be led by
the construction sector. Chemicals and heavy industry output expanded over
10 percent as exports from those industries picked up relative to the first
quarter of 1990. Korea's current account deficit rose to $4.8 billion in
the first four months of 1991 from $1.2 billion in the same period last
year, as a steep rise in imports of oil and capital goods more than offset a
recovery in exports.
In Taiwan, economic growth appears to be recovering somewhat from the
slowdown in 1990. Industrial production was 5.5 percent higher in the first
five months of 1991 than a year earlier. In the first five months of 1991,
the cumulative trade surplus (on a customs basis) fell slightly to $3.6
billion from $3.8 billion in the same period last year despite a large
increase in exports. Imports of industrial raw materials, including crude
oil, grew rapidly in the first five months of 1991.
