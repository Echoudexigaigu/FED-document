DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The news on the economy continues to be mixed. Business
establishments reported a rebound in the aggregate hours of
production workers in August, and manufacturing output rose further
despite what seems to have been a temporary drop in motor vehicle
assemblies. However, non-auto retail sales in August retraced part
of a large July gain, recent data on residential construction have
been lackluster, and businesses remain cautious about investing in
either inventories or fixed capital. Wages and prices appear to be
on a path of gradual deceleration.
Employment and Unemployment
Payroll employment rose 34,000 in August; and, with a rebound
in the workweek, aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory
workers increased 0.7 percent, after a drop of 1.1 percent in
July. However, signs of weakness in labor demand also continued
to be evident: The payroll survey showed further declines in
construction, trade, and state and local government in August; and,
in the household survey, employment fell almost 300,000 to a new
cyclical low. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.8 percent.
Since mid-August, when the employment surveys were taken, weekly
filings of initial claims for unemployment insurance have held
steady at about 420,000 per week (on FR seasonals), suggesting that
the growth of payrolls probably has remained sluggish into
September.
1. The initial reading on aggregate hours in July showed a
deeper decline of 1.4 percent.

Private payrolls rose 65,000 in August and now are estimated to
have been little changed in July instead of down 40,000. The
manufacturing sector added 42,000 jobs, with gains in a large number
of industries. Manufacturers also boosted the factory workweek to
40.9 hours, the highest it has been in nearly a year. In the
private service-producing sector, employment rose 41,000 in August,
owing mostly to employment increases in health and business
services. The rest of the service-producing sector, especially
wholesale and retail trade, remained weak.

The cumulative rise in private payroll employment from April to
August amounted to only 0.2 percent (table). This showing is within
the range of results seen in previous postwar recoveries, but it is
well to the low side of the average. While employment in
manufacturing has been following a path fairly close to that of the
average recovery, gains in the service-producing sector since April
have been exceptionally low relative to earlier postwar recoveries.

The weakness has been concentrated in the trade sector, especially
among retailers of general merchandise and wholesalers of durable
goods; firms carrying industrial machinery and farm machinery have
been particularly hard hit.
In August, the payroll and household measures of employment
diverged sharply, as they often do on a monthly basis. But the two
series seem to be tracing out fairly similar pictures of the changes
in labor demand if viewed in a somewhat longer time frame,
particularly if adjustment is made for the differences in coverage
between the two measures (table). For example, the household and
payroll surveys show quite similar declines in employment between
July 1990 and May 1991, and they are in agreement in showing labor
demand to have been essentially flat since May. 2
The labor force participation rate fell further in August to
65.7 percent, down about 3/4 percentage point from its highs of 1989
and early 1990. Much of the drop in participation appears to
reflect increases in the number of individuals reporting themselves
as retired and in the number of persons who have postponed
employment in order to attend school. Although it is difficult to
2. During the expansion of the 1980s, growth in payroll jobs
outpaced the household count of persons employed by a wide margin.
Much of that gap, adjusted for differences in coverage, was
attributable to increases in multiple jobholding. Between May
1985 and May 1989, the dates of the last two BLS surveys of dual
jobholding, the number of persons with more than one
nonagricultural job rose 1.1 million; this rise was equal to about
two-thirds of the gap between gains in the payroll survey and
gains in the adjusted household survey over that period. Between
May 1989 and July 1990, the gap between the two series widened at
an even faster pace, with the payroll series up about twice as
much as the adjusted household measure. The similarity in the
size of the changes in the two series since last July likely owes
to an ebbing of multiple jobholding, which tends to level off or
decline during periods of weak labor demand.

determine how much of the recent drop is cyclical, econometric
research by the staff suggests that the softness in the
participation rate has been somewhat greater than can be explained
by cyclical factors alone.
Wage rates, as measured by average hourly earnings, increased
0.4 percent in August (table). In the manufacturing sector, hourly
earnings rose 0.5 percent, partly reflecting an increase in the
number of hours worked at premium overtime rates. Over the twelve
months ended in August, average hourly earnings increased
3.2 percent--almost 3/4 percentage point below the pace of a year
ago.

Industrial Production
Industrial production rose 0.3 percent in August; in addition,
production data for June and July were revised up and now show gains
of 0.8 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. Since its most recent
trough in March 1991, total industrial production has grown at an
average monthly pace of 0.6 percent, compared with an average of

II-8
0.9 percent over the first five months of the previous seven
recoveries. The somewhat less vigorous behavior of the total index
relative to previous cyclical episodes has reflected slower than
usual growth in consumer durable goods, construction supplies, and
materials.
Last month, growth in the total index was held down about
1/4 percentage point by a sharp drop in assemblies of motor
vehicles, which fell to an annual rate of 8.7 million units (FRB
seasonals). Industry sources attributed this drop to difficulties
in modifying assembly plants for model changeover as well as to
weakness in orders both from dealers and from rental fleets.
Domestic auto and truck manufacturers have scheduled a substantial
rise in motor vehicle assemblies in September, to an annual rate of
10.4 million units. In the first three weeks of the month, auto
production proceeded about on schedule, but truck production fell
about 10 percent short of the scheduled assembly rate. Even so, if
the pace of the first three weeks were to continue for the remainder
of the month, the September rise in domestic motor vehicle
production would directly boost the total IP index about 0.4
percentage point.

Dealers' inventories of cars inched up in August, but this rise
reversed only a tiny portion of the liquidation of the previous nine
months, and stocks remain historically low relative to sales. The
August level of inventories amounted to 47 days' supply, well below
the traditional norm of nearly 60 days' supply. Inventories of
light trucks have risen slightly over the past two months; the
latest reading amounts to 87 days' supply (FRB seasonals).
Production of consumer durables other than motor vehicles
continued to post noticeable gains in July and August, mainly
because of gains in output of carpeting, furniture, appliances, and
other household goods. In addition, production of most types of
nondurable consumer goods was up in August. By contrast, business
equipment, which dropped sharply late last year and in early 1991,
remains weak; overall, production of equipment has changed little
since the spring, as gains in output of aircraft and equipment
primarily used outside of the industrial sector, such as farm and
service industry equipment, have been offset by continued
sluggishness in the production of industrial equipment and
computers.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing edged up in August but
has retraced only one-fourth of the decline of 6 percentage points
that occurred between July 1990 and March 1991. Since the spring,
operating rates have increased in most primary processing
industries, especially textiles, lumber, steel, and nonferrous
metals. By contrast, utilization at advanced processing industries
has risen only slightly; increases in operating rates at industries

products have been offset by further declines in nonelectrical
machinery and instruments.
Personal Income and Consumption
The monthly changes in income and consumption have been erratic
as of late. Nominal personal income weakened in July, because
of a deterioration in labor income brought on by a substantial drop
in aggregate hours worked; real disposable income, which had
registered strong gains in May and June, was down 0.1 percent.
However, with the August employment report showing sizable increases
in both hours worked and hourly wages, labor income probably more
than recovered from the July drop. Given the small rise in consumer
prices last month, much of this nominal increase should translate
into real gains.
In real terms, spending on durable and nondurable goods lifted
personal consumption expenditures 0.4 percent in July (not an annual
rate); spending on services declined slightly as energy usage fell
from the abnormal levels reached during the hot weather in May and
June. In August, nominal retail sales declined 0.7 percent. Most
of the drop reflected a 2.7 percent decline in the sales of
4. Some fairly sizable revisions have been made to the second-
quarter data since the last Greenbook. The personal saving rate
for the second quarter, which is now estimated to have been
4.2 percent, was revised up an unusually large 0.5 percentage
point from the initial estimate of 3.7 percent. Of the total
revision, roughly 0.3 point reflected a higher estimate of
disposable personal income and 0.2 percentage point reflected a
lower estimate of personal consumption expenditures.
Most of the downward revision in growth of PCE in the second
quarter, from 3.6 percent to 2.8 percent, resulted from a reduced
estimate of consumer outlays for motor vehicles. Incoming vehicle
registration data showed that businesses had purchased many of the
automobiles originally attributed to household purchases. The
strength of sales to the business sector reportedly was the result
of a surge of auto purchases by the daily rental fleets in June.

spending at automotive dealers and at building material and supply
stores, sales edged down 0.1 percent last month after a nominal rise
of 0.7 percent in July. Altogether, the data for the retail control
category suggest that the August level of real personal consumption
expenditures for items other than autos was close to 1 percent above
the second-quarter average (not an annual rate).

sales of domestic autos evidently was a reflection of a bunching of
purchases around mid-year by the daily rental fleets, in response to
impending changes in automakers' fleet repurchase programs. In the
first twenty days of September, sales of domestic cars retraced part
of their August decline, and sales of domestically produced light
trucks strengthened considerably.
Housing Markets
The recovery in housing activity showed signs of stalling this
summer. In the single-family market, starts edged up 0.6 percent in
August, while permits--a more reliable indicator of the onset of
construction--declined 2.9 percent. The flattening of production
appears to be a response to some softening in demand for single-
family housing. New home sales declined 8 percent in July; sales of
existing homes fell 7 percent in July and then declined another
2 percent in August. The falloff in sales is consistent with trade
association reports from home builders.
Sales have been weak despite relatively favorable cash-flow
housing affordability as gauged by the customary measures of
mortgage payments relative to income. However, the impetus from
this positive factor has been damped, perhaps by diminished
expectations of capital gains from homeownership, an oversupply of
apartments that keeps downward pressure on rents, and uncertainties
about the economic outlook and job security.
In the multifamily sector, construction has remained near its
thirty-year low. Multifamily starts were at 173,000 units in
August; activity has been close to this level all year. Permit
issuance for multifamily construction fell 12.3 percent in August,
to a level about in line with starts. The low level of construction

has diminished the importance of multifamily housing in total
residential investment. Only 8 percent of residential investment
expenditures (and 0.3 percent of GNP) now is attributable to
multifamily construction. 5 These percentages were about twice as
large in 1986, before multifamily construction began its decline.
Business Fixed Investment
A hint of firming is evident in the indicators of business
equipment spending. Recent data suggest that growth in real outlays
for equipment probably has been slightly positive again in the
quarter now ending; these outlays grew at a 2 percent annual pace in
the second quarter, after plunging in the first quarter of 1991.
The composition of growth this quarter has remained much the
same as in the second quarter: Declines in spending on industrial
equipment have been more than offset by increased investment in
computers and, to a lesser extent, transportation equipment. In
nominal terms, average shipments in July and August of nondefense
capital goods excluding aircraft and computing equipment were
1-1/2 percent below the second-quarter level, suggesting a
significant decline in real outlays for these items. However, the
nominal value of computer shipments during the past two months have
averaged slightly above the second-quarter level. With continuing
declines in computer prices, the gains in real spending on computers
this quarter probably have been fairly robust. 6 Furthermore,
5. By comparison, new single-family construction accounts for
46 percent of residential investment and 1.7 percent of GNP. The
remaining 46 percent of residential construction mainly reflects
spending for residential improvements and commissions paid to real
estate agents.
6. The average level of the PPI for electronic computers in
July and August was 30 percent below the second-quarter level
(annual rate).

II-18
during July and August, average shipments of complete aircraft and
average sales of heavy trucks were both above their second-quarter
levels, suggesting that spending on transportation equipment
continued to increase this quarter as well.
Looking ahead, the prospects for a near-term improvement in the
growth of equipment investment appear to be favorable. New orders
in August for nondefense capital goods other than aircraft and
computers fell 4 percent but, on the basis of earlier increases,
remained about 2 percent above the second-quarter level. In
addition, the persistence of a large backlog of unfilled orders for
aircraft should ensure increases in future production of planes.
Indeed, with many start-up problems resolved and a new system of
production management in place, McDonnell-Douglas is doubling the
pace of production--to a rate of one aircraft per week--of the new
MD-11 tri-jet, thus facilitating a speed up of deliveries. In
addition, Boeing continues to make small, steady increases in
aircraft production.
Significant increases in real spending on computers are likely
during the rest of this year. In the past two weeks, IBM has begun
to ship the two most powerful models of the new generation of
8mainframes that the company unveiled a year ago. Analysts
expect IBM to ship about 250 to 300 of these machines this year at
an average (current-dollar) cost of about $15 million apiece.
7. American Airlines recently announced that it would cancel
some of its options to buy aircraft, but this cancellation applies
to deliveries in 1993 and beyond. Also, this action will have no
immediate effect on the reported backlog of orders (which is
reported net of cancellations) because options are not entered in
manufacturers' official order books.
8. The new computers are water-cooled models in the ES/9000
line.

II-19
Although many of these shipments undoubtedly will displace sales of
other mainframes, total investment in computers still seems likely
to rise.
Real outlays for nonresidential structures appear likely to
continue to plunge in the near term. The nominal value of
construction put in place in July was almost 4 percent below the
second-quarter level (not an annual rate). Although industrial
construction appears to have stabilized, the overwhelming influence
on construction is the ongoing reduction in office, other
commercial, and hotel building. The prospects for construction put
in place over the long term also remain bleak, as the value of new
construction contracts has been trending down since 1989.
Drilling and mining, which declined 12-1/2 percent during the
first half of this year, is likely to fall even further in the
current quarter. Indeed, the number of drilling rigs in use during
July and August was 7-3/4 percent below the second-quarter level.
This decline largely reflects the spectacular drop in natural gas
spot prices this year; if these prices remain close to their current
levels, drilling appears likely to suffer further declines in the
near term.
The latest Commerce Department survey of business plans for
plant and equipment indicates a 0.5 percent rise in nominal outlays
this year (in terms of annual averages). These plans, which were
collected in July and August, are 2-1/4 percentage points lower than
those reported in the spring. By now, of course, these annual
figures are reflecting the weight of past quarters to a substantial
degree; their usefulness in gauging future trends in outlays is
quite limited. For example, when used to forecast the increase in

plant and equipment spending between the second and fourth quarters
over the past three decades, the July-August survey has a mean
absolute error of more than four percentage points (annual rate).
Thus, while the latest survey is pointing to a rise in nominal P&E
spending of 6 percent at an annual rate over the last two quarters
of 1991, the confidence interval around that figure is very
wide.
Inventories
Business inventories continued to decline rapidly early in the
third quarter. In July, stocks in manufacturing and trade fell at
an annual rate of $31.8 billion in current-cost terms, after
drawdowns averaging $50 billion at an annual rate during the second
quarter. Excluding the stocks of retail auto dealers, the July
reduction amounted to almost $40 billion, about the same as the
second-quarter pace. The inventory-sales ratio for manufacturing
and trade excluding retail autos was about the same in July as that
observed last year before the beginning of the downturn; it thus
would appear that the intensive liquidation efforts of recent months
have eliminated most of the imbalance that developed last winter.
Manufacturing stocks were liquidated in July at about the same
rapid pace as in the second quarter. The decline in July was
accompanied by sizable gains in shipments, and the sector's
inventory-to-shipments ratio moved down another step, into the lower
portion of the range seen over the past year (chart). At the
9. The July-August P&E survey may overstate investment plans
because of its low sample coverage in several crucial industries
that likely have posted large declines. In particular, a large
component of commercial construction activity is excluded from
this survey because spending plans for the real estate industry
are reported only annually, in the January-March survey.

industry level, nearly one-third of the July inventory runoff was in
stocks of transportation equipment, in part reflecting a sharp
(7.3 percent) rise in shipments of motor vehicles and automotive
accessories in that month. Inventories in major materials-producing
industries (primary metals, chemicals, paper and paper products, and
rubber and plastics), where shipments were unusually brisk in July,
also were reduced substantially. As a result of continued
corrections since early spring, the inventory positions of these
materials industries have shown marked improvement; nevertheless,
except for rubber and plastics, their inventories remain above
prerecession levels.
Wholesale inventories were trimmed further in July after
sizable drawdowns in the preceding several months. The July
liquidation was concentrated in a few categories of durable goods,
particularly in stocks of machinery and business equipment. Before
the second quarter of this year, wholesale machinery inventories had
been rising persistently while shipments weakened. The sharp
declines in machinery stocks in July, as well as drawdowns during
the second quarter, helped to lower the inventory-sales ratio for
this group of wholesale distributors; the July ratio was the lowest
of the past year.
In retail trade, non-auto inventories expanded only slightly
from April to July as sales advanced moderately. The inventory-
sales ratio for retail establishments outside of auto dealers moved
down to 1.46 months in July, quite a bit below the recession high of
1.52 months registered in January. For most types of retail
establishments, especially the broad range of stores in the GAF

II-25
grouping that sell largely discretionary consumption goods,
inventory-sales ratios have fallen below their pre-recession levels.
Federal Sector
The federal unified budget deficit for July and August totaled
nearly $85 billion, bringing the deficit for the first eleven months
of the fiscal year to $261 billion; it was $241 billion for the
first eleven months of the last fiscal year. In September, the
final month of the fiscal year, the budget frequently shows a
surplus--or a very small deficit--because receipts bulge with the
filing of quarterly estimated personal and corporate income tax
payments. This year, however, daily Treasury data indicate that a
pickup in RTC outlays and continued weakness in tax collections will
result in a moderate budget deficit for September. (Last year,
September's social security benefits were paid in August, creating a
record August deficit and a record September surplus.)
Receipts for July and August were 3 percent above a year
earlier. Withholdings of income and social insurance taxes also
increased about 3 percent, boosted, in part, by the legislated
increase, from $51,000 last year to $125,000 this year, in the
annual wages that are subject to Medicare taxes. The growth in
these receipts, relative to a year earlier, will pick up in the
second half, as workers whose earnings exceeded the old cap by this
time last year now will be paying the tax through year-end. An
extension of social insurance tax coverage to additional state and
local workers also began adding to withholdings as of July 1.
Federal receipts from excise taxes in July and August were
54 percent higher than a year earlier, partly reflecting the
increases in the gasoline tax and other excise taxes enacted last

fall. Nonwithheld personal and corporate income taxes in September
are running about 4 percent above a year earlier, according to the
daily data.
Outlays in July and August were 14 percent above a year
earlier, after adjusting for last year's shift in the timing of
social security benefit payments. Deposit insurance outlays account
for much of the increase. Outlays by the RTC, the FSLIC Resolution
Fund, and the Bank Insurance Fund totaled $19 billion in July and
August compared with $7 billion a year earlier. Daily data indicate
that approximately another $16 billion have been spent by these
entities in September. Elsewhere, the incoming data show continued
increases in defense outlays (excluding foreign contributions for
Desert Storm), rapid growth for Medicaid and income security, and
increased outlays for some discretionary spending areas, such as
administration of justice, education, and international affairs.
The Congress has passed only 3 of the 13 regular appropriations
bills. Although most money issues have been resolved, many of the
remaining bills have been delayed by disagreements over provisions
concerning abortion. If these bills are not completed and signed by
the President by October 1, a continuing resolution will be required
to fund the government until the regular appropriations bills are
passed. The bills, as they stand, appear to conform to last year's
budget act. The Congress also is considering a five-year
reauthorization of transportation programs and an extension of
unemployment benefits. 10

The CBO issued its summer update of the budget outlook in mid-
August. The near-term deficit estimates are similar to OMB's July
projections. Specifically, the CBO projects a $279 billion deficit
(5.0 percent of GNP) for the 1991 fiscal year, including $77 billion
of deposit insurance outlays (chart). Data received since mid-
August indicate that deposit insurance outlays and the deficit may
be lower, however. The 1992 fiscal year deficit is projected to
rise to $362 billion, even if the new budget law is adhered to,
largely because of increases in net outlays for deposit insurance
and the end of foreign contributions for Operation Desert Storm.
The CBO has become more pessimistic about the longer-term outlook
for the budget; it now expects the deficit, excluding deposit
insurance, to fall only to $200 billion (2.6 percent of GNP) by
1996. In contrast, the Administration projects that this measure of
the deficit will decline continuously and fall below $100 billion
(1.2 percent of GNP) by 1996 (chart). The lower deficit forecast
reflects the Administration's more optimistic assumptions for real
GNP growth.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local
governments apparently have continued to contract in the third
quarter. Employment in the sector fell sharply in both July and
August; the total decline amounted to about 100,000, according to
preliminary data. Although cuts in hiring appear to have been
widespread, the largest declines, purely in terms of the number of
workers, seem to be in education employment at the local level, a
category that makes up about 40 percent of state and local
employment. Real outlays for construction, which account for

13 percent of state and local purchases, fell again in July to a
level about 1 percent below the second-quarter average. Further
large reductions in spending for highways and sewer systems were
reported. Apparently, many governments have postponed expenditures
on construction projects and have laid off workers to cope with
recent fiscal difficulties.
According to a recent survey by the National Association of
Counties, about 40 percent of all large counties--those with
populations of 100,000 or more--are facing deficits in fiscal year
1991.11 About half are trying to close their budget gaps through
expenditure reductions alone; another 40 percent are cutting
spending and raising revenue; and only 8 percent are attempting to
balance their budgets solely through revenue-raising measures. The
current budget problems have resulted from a "structural fiscal gap"
and from the effects of the recession. The counties blame the
underlying problems on a period of declining federal assistance, an
escalation in the number and costs of services, and a wave of
unfunded federal and state mandates.
Prices
Inflation appears to be slowing gradually. Both the CPI and
the PPI for finished goods rose 0.2 percent in August, held down in
part by declines in food prices. Although the CPI excluding food
and energy has risen faster in recent months than it did in the
spring, the twelve-month change in this indicator of core inflation
has continued to edge down; the slowing over the past year amounts
11. Around half of all counties begin their fiscal year on
January 1, another 25 percent begin the year on July 1, and the
remainder start the year on September 1 or November 1. Spending
at the county level accounts for 13 percent of total state and
local outlays.

II-32
to nearly 1 percentage point. Moreover, the elements of a gradual
deceleration of inflation still seem to be in place: The
unemployment rate is well above the estimated "natural" rate; the
trend of wage increases has slowed; expectations of inflation are
easing; and upward pressures from import prices, energy prices, and
commodity prices have been virtually absent.
Food prices fell in August for a second month. As in July, a
steep drop in the prices of fruits and vegetables more than
accounted for the August decline. Excluding the prices of fruits
and vegetables, which have been enormously volatile from month to
month, the CPI for food has risen 0.1 to 0.2 percent in almost every
month since the start of the year. Overall, food prices have slowed
sharply this year after rising 5 percent or more in each year from
1988 to 1990; in August the index for food was only 2.3 percent
above the level of a year earlier. Increases in supplies in some
areas--notably, of meats and poultry--have helped to shape this
deceleration. However, the slowdown also has extended to most other
food groups, including many for which prices typically are affected
much more by the costs of nonfarm inputs than by supply conditions
in agriculture. Thus, much of the deceleration in food prices this
past year probably is, in fact, a reflection of many of the same
forces that are contributing to a gradual deceleration of prices in
the general economy. In the farm sector, futures prices for grain
have been firming of late; production prospects diminished a bit
further in August, and traders are speculating that farm exports,
which have been weak, will be boosted by increased aid to the states
emerging from the break-up of the Soviet Union.

II-33
Energy prices edged down 0.2 percent further in the August CPI,
as declines in natural gas and electricity rates more than offset a
pickup for motor fuels and fuel oil. Gasoline prices posted a small
increase (after seasonal adjustment) at retail and were up sharply
at the refinery level. The recent upward pressures on gasoline
prices mainly have reflected a tight inventory situation owing to
reduced imports and some domestic refinery problems. Now, according
to private surveys, the inventory tightness appears to be easing and
retail prices in September were little changed, before seasonal
adjustment, although the CPI for gasoline may post a small increase
on a seasonally adjusted basis.
August was the third consecutive month in which the CPI
excluding food and energy items rose 0.4 percent; increases in the
three preceding months were 0.1 percent or 0.2 percent. The recent
increases reflect, in part, problems with seasonal adjustment and
some recent bunching of increases in prices and in state and local
sales and excise taxes. The apparel index was raised in both July
and August by the early introduction of higher-priced fall and
winter clothing into the CPI sample; these increases accounted for
about half or more of the advances in the CPI for goods other than
food or energy in those two months. Large increases also were
registered in August for some other goods, notably for prescription
drugs. Prices of new motor vehicles were up 0.2 percent, reflecting
somewhat less discounting than usually occurs near the end of the
model year. In the services component, tuition and other school
fees rose more than 1 percent, as higher charges for the new
academic year were introduced into the sample earlier than
"expected" by the CPI seasonal factors. Medical service costs also

posted a large increase, and airfares turned up. Nevertheless, the
index for nonenergy services rose a moderate 0.3 percent, held down
by the rent components.
This past year has brought a marked deceleration in the CPI for
nonenergy services. The twelve-month change in this index (chart)
has eased, as of August, to less than 5 percent; from the summer of
1990 into the early months of 1991, the pace had been 6 percent or
more. A sharp slowing in rent increases, reflecting weak rental
markets, accounts for most of this deceleration. 12 The CPI for
both residential (tenants') rent and owners' equivalent rent rose
only about 3 percent over the twelve months ended in August,
compared with increases of about 4-1/2 percent and 6-1/4 percent,
respectively, over the preceding twelve-month period. There has
been much less deceleration, on average, in price increases for
other services.
In contrast to services, the CPI for nonfood, nonenergy
commodities has risen faster over the past twelve months than it did
during the preceding year--about 4-1/2 percent compared with
3-3/4 percent. A portion of this acceleration can be attributed to
the higher federal excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco
products effective in January as well as to the recent increases in
excise and sales taxes at the state and local levels. However,
prices of new motor vehicles have risen 4-1/4 percent over the
year--more than 2 percentage points above the increase during the
preceding year--contributing about 0.4 percentage point to the
12. As of December 1990, rents had a relative importance weight
in the CPI for nonenergy services of almost one-half.

acceleration in this CPI goods component. Slowing in some other
goods categories, notably apparel, was partially offsetting.
At the producer level, the twelve-month rise in the PPI for
finished consumer goods (nonfood, nonenergy), although down from the
first-quarter pace, does not appear markedly different from that
posted over the year ended in August 1990. However, capital
equipment prices were up less than 3 percent over the past year,
compared with an increase of about 3-1/2 percent over the preceding
year. This deceleration reflects smaller price increases for
agricultural machinery, construction machinery and equipment,
machine tools, commercial furniture, and some other capital
equipment items.
At earlier stages of processing, prices of intermediate
materials less food and energy were unchanged, on average, in August
and appear to be flattening out after retreating earlier in the
year. The PPI for crude nonfood materials less energy posted its
first increase since January, mainly owing to higher prices for some
nonferrous metal scrap and ores. The index remained about 10
percent below its level of a year earlier. More recently, price
movements in spot commodity markets, have been mixed, with the
changes relatively small, on balance. The Journal of Commerce index
of industrial prices, has changed little, on net, since the August
FOMC meeting; the sub-index for metals, while remaining in a narrow
13range, has edged down somewhat further, on net. 13
13. The CRB futures index has been boosted since mid-August by
increases in the prices of some foodstuffs.

APPENDIX
THE DEBATE OVER EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Congress is considering legislation that would extend
additional unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to long-term
unemployed workers who have exhausted their regular UI benefits.
The current proposals follow passage of similar legislation in
August. The President signed the earlier legislation but negated
its effectiveness by failing to declare the budget emergency
necessary to provide funding for an extended benefits program. This
appendix describes the existing laws covering extended UI benefits,
discusses the issues surrounding the current debate, and summarizes
the changes proposed in the legislation now under consideration.
Background
The extended benefits program for unemployment insurance was
first established in the 1970 amendments to the Social Security Act.
The program offered an additional thirteen weeks of unemployment
compensation to unemployed workers who had exhausted their regular
UI benefits (usually lasting twenty-six weeks), with the additional
benefits jointly funded by the state and federal governments.
In the original program, extended benefits were triggered nationally
when the insured unemployment rate (IUR) for the United States rose
above 4.5 percent. In addition, extended benefits were triggered
for an individual state if the state's IUR exceeded 4 percent for a
thirteen-week period and the state IUR was 120 percent of its
average in the same period in the preceding year or, at the state's
option, if the state IUR exceeded 5 percent regardless of its level
in the preceding year.
In 1981, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act revised the
criteria used to trigger the extended benefits program. The
national trigger was eliminated, and the basic state IUR trigger was
raised to 5 percent with the provision that the state IUR was at
least 120 percent of3its average in the corresponding weeks in the
preceding two years. In addition, the optional trigger was
raised from 5 percent to 6 percent. Currently, extended benefits
1. The strict rule is that no claimant may receive more than 39
times their regular weekly benefit from the regular and extended
benefits programs. In most states, the weekly extended benefit
payments are the same as under the regular state program and last
for one-half the number of weeks that the regular payments were
received.
2. The revisions to the extended benefits program did not take
effect until October 1, 1982. At the same time, the Congress
enacted the Federal Supplemental Compensation program, which was in
effect from September 1982 through March 1983. This program paid
additional benefits of up to six weeks in all states, up to eight
weeks in states with an IUR at or above 3.5 percent, and up to ten
weeks in states that had offered extended benefits after June 1,
1982.
3. Once the trigger has deactivated extended benefits in a state,
the state must remain in that status for at least thirteen weeks.

are available only in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico, although the
program was activated at some point this year in seven other
states.
Issues Underlying the Current Debate
The impetus for the recent proposals to expand the extended
benefits program appears to stem from three developments. First and
most obvious, the economic recession and the resulting rise in
unemployment have led to real and clearly visible hardships for many
individuals. The new proposals represent a straightforward way to
aid the unemployed population.
Second, there is clear evidence that the unemployment insurance
system over the past decade has been less effective than it was in
the 1970s as an income support program for the unemployed. Although
the fraction of employed workers covered by the UI system has risen
to more than 90 percent, the percentage of the unemployed receiving
unemployment insurance benefits trended down through the mid-1980s;
in the latest recession about 45 percent of the unemployed received
UI benefits, compared with nearly 70 percent in 1975 (chart, top
panel). Similarly, whereas the insured unemployment rate stood at
nearly 80 percent of the civilian jobless rate in the mid-1970s, it
was less than half the level of the civilian unemployment rate in
the recent recession (middle panel).
Researchers have identified several likely causes of the
decline in the ratio of UI recipients to total unemployment,
although no study has been able to account completely for the
decline. Among the reported causes are changes in state and
federal laws in the late 1970s and early 1980s--most notably,
tighter state eligibility requirements, partial taxation of UI
benefits, and the incorporation of compulsory pension-offset
provisions. However, other factors also have been linked to the
decline in the use of the UI system. Most notable among these are
the shrinkage of the manufacturing sector (where laid-off workers
apparently are more likely to file UI claims), shifts in the
geographic distribution of unemployment away from high-coverage
regions such as the Northeast toward low-coverage regions such as
the South-Central, and a puzzling decline in the proportion of the
UI-eligible unemployed who file for UI benefits (the so-called
takeup rate).
4. Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Vermont, and
West Virginia.
5. The three most comprehensive studies available are Gary
Burtless, "Why is Insured Unemployment So Low?," Brookings Papers on
Economic Activity, 1983:1, pp. 225-49; Walter Corson and Walter
Nicholson, An Examination of Declining UI Claims During the 1980s
(U.S. Department of Labor, 1988); and Rebecca Blank and David Card,
"Recent Trends in Insured and Uninsured Employment: Is There an
Explanation?" Working Paper 2871 (National Bureau of Economic
Research, March 1989).
6. Indeed, Blank and Card argue that the decline in the takeup
rate is the major factor behind the lower percentage of unemployed
receiving UI benefits. In part, this decline can be traced to a
(Footnote continues on next page)

II-A-4
A third source of concern among members of the Congress has
been the limited availability of extended benefits during the
recession. As noted above, only eight states and Puerto Rico
activated the extended benefits program in 1991, and the share of
unemployed workers receiving extended benefits was much lower than
in previous recessions (chart, bottom panel). In part, this
reflects a smaller rise in the unemployment rate in the recent
downturn than is typical in a recession. However, the 1981 changes
to the trigger mechanism and the relative decline in the insured
unemployment rate (the trigger variable) also helped to limit the
number of states offering extended benefits. For example, if the
insured unemployment rate had remained at 80 percent of the civilian
unemployment rate in each state, twenty-nine states would have
offered extended benefits during the recession. Had the trigger
levels not been raised in 1981 as well, the number of states
offering extended benefits at some point this year would have risen
to forty.
The Current House and Senate Bills
The legislation currently before the Congress generally is
intended to increase the availability of additional UI benefits to
long-term jobless workers by altering (either temporarily or
permanently) the criteria used to trigger the offering of extended
benefits in each state. In the House version of the bill, which was
passed on September 17, five weeks of extended benefits would be
provided in all states through 1992, so long as the national total
unemployment rate remains at or above 6 percent. In addition, the
bill would permanently change the extended benefits program to allow
for an additional ten, fifteen, or twenty weeks of benefits if a
state's total unemployment rate is 6, 7, or 8 percent respectively
and if a state's total unemployment rate is equal to or exceeds 120
percent of its average for the corresponding three-month period in
each of the preceding two calendar years. The House bill, which is
estimated to cost $6-1/2 billion over five years, would waive the
pay-as-you-go requirements of the budget law and would automatically
trigger an emergency designation if the President signs the
legislation or if the Congress overrides a veto.
(Footnote continued from previous page)
shift in the distribution of unemployment from states with higher
average takeup rates to states with lower takeup rates. The
remainder is unexplained by the existing studies, although it may,
to some extent, reflect reduced incentives to collect UI benefits in
the 1980s because of the changes in the tax and pension provisions
of the federal law, described above.
7. In contrast to the existing extended benefits program, the
costs of the legislation now being considered would be borne by the
federal government. Democrats argue that the $7.7 billion surplus
currently in the extended unemployment benefit trust fund is more
than enough to fund the proposed additional UI benefits and should
be used for that purpose. However, the trust fund is included in
the pay-as-you-go requirements of last year's budget agreement, and
an emergency declaration would still be needed to authorize
additional benefits unless budgetary offsets were made elsewhere.

II-A-5
The Senate version, which was passed on September 24, would
establish a temporary nine-month program of additional benefits.
Seven weeks of extended benefits would be made available in all
states under the Senate plan; extended benefits of thirteen or
twenty weeks would be available in states with an unemployment rate
of 7 or 8 percent respectively. In contrast to the House version,
the Senate plan does not automatically waive the pay-as-you-go
requirement of the budget law, and hence an emergency declaration by
the President would be needed to fund the program; the cost of the
Senate plan is estimated at about $6 billion. The House and Senate
versions will now go to a joint conference committee for
reconciliation. The President has expressed support for a more
modest self-financed plan proposed by Senator Dole but is likely to
veto any bill that violates last year's budget agreement.
Estimates of the number of unemployed who would receive
additional benefits vary by proposal and by assumptions about the
employment status of persons who have exhausted their regular UI
benefits. About 2-1/4 million individuals exhausted their regular
UI benefits between January and August, according to the Department
of Labor, and some observers argue that the cumulative total could
reach 3-1/2 million by the end of the year. However, neither the
number of exhaustions nor the corresponding exhaustion rate
(exhaustions as a percentage of first payments) is especially high
by historical standards (chart). Moreover, many of these potential
claimants are likely to have taken jobs since that time; indeed, the
number of persons unemployed for twenty-seven weeks or longer was
only 1.2 million according to the August employment report. In
addition, the House and Senate bills differ as to who would be
eligible for the new program. Both bills would make additional
benefits available to those who exhaust their regular benefits after
October 1991, and both contain a reachback provision to cover
individuals in states with an unemployment rate above 6 percent.
However, the reachback provision of the House plan is somewhat more
generous than in the Senate bill, and the length of time extended
benefits would be available in all states is somewhat greater; in
addition, the House plan would permanently ease the trigger for the
extended benefits program.
8. Dole's proposal would offer between six and ten weeks of
additional UI benefits and would be funded by permanently extending
the IRS tax refund offset program (which is used primarily to
collect unpaid student loans) and by auctioning unused radio
frequencies owned by the federal government.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Weak monetary growth and mixed economic indicators have
provided the backdrop for a broad rally in fixed income markets.
Supported by a reduction of the discount rate to 5 percent on
September 13, and an associated 1/4 point drop in the federal funds
rate, most interest rates have declined by 10 to 20 basis points
since the August FOMC meeting. Treasury bill rates have been an
exception, posting small increases, but they had been depressed at
the time of the August meeting by uncertainties surrounding events
in the Soviet Union. Immediately after the discount rate
announcement major banks cut their prime lending rate 50 basis
points to 8 percent. Nevertheless, the prime remains unusually high
in relation to funding costs. Major stock indexes set record highs
in the week following the August meeting but have given back some
gains as the near-term outlook for earnings has dimmed. Still, most
major indexes are up 2 to 4 percent.
Weakness in M2 and M3 persisted in August and appears to have
carried over into early September, dropping these aggregates down to
the bottom of their annual ranges. M2 was about unchanged last
month, and for the third quarter as a whole its velocity appears
likely to decline at around a 4 percent rate, despite the decline in
market interest rates over the past several quarters. Some of the
weakness in M2 can be attributed to shifts to higher yielding non-M2
assets, such as bond funds. In addition, households may be drawing
down M2 balances to pay off outstanding debt or to avoid building up
additional debt at a time when yields on M2 assets have fallen
relative to borrowing costs. The contraction in M3 moderated in

August; with depository credit still shrinking, runoffs of large
time deposits continued but were partly offset by sizable inflows to
institution-only money funds.
Borrowing by the private sector evidently has remained
sluggish recently. In the business sector, heavy public bond
issuance since the beginning of August has been offset by declines
in bank loans and commercial paper. The proceeds of equity
offerings, which have been near record levels, also have been used
by many firms to reduce short-term indebtedness. Incoming
information suggests a continued subdued pace of household mortgage
borrowing this quarter, while consumer credit posted a decline in
July and remained weak at banks in August. Borrowing by the
Treasury, in contrast, is expected to reach a record in the third
quarter, and borrowing by state and local governments appears to
have picked up recently.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 was unchanged in August, placing the aggregate around
the lower bound of its target growth cone. Data through mid-
September suggest little recovery in this aggregate, implying a
small decline in the third quarter. M2 velocity will register a
sizable advance this quarter, perhaps at more than a 4 percent pace,
despite the decline in market rates and opportunity costs over the
past several quarters. The shortfall in M2 growth in the third
quarter relative to that forecast by the Board's models of money
demand is likely to be on the order of 6 percentage points at an
annual rate.
The weakness in M2 growth appears in part to reflect shifts
by households into higher-yielding non-M2 instruments. Bond funds,

in particular, registered sizable inflows in July, and inflows to
such funds reportedly were again brisk in August. Shifts into non-
M2 assets have become increasingly attractive as depository
institutions, facing weak loan demand and regulatory and capital
market pressures to strengthen capital positions, have been
reluctant to bid aggressively for retail deposits. In addition, low
yields on M2 assets relative to the cost of consumer credit may be
inducing households to pay down debt or to finance spending by
drawing down their M2 balances.
M3 ran off further in August, at a 1-1/2 percent rate, and
data for early September provide scant evidence of a rebound.
Institution-only money fund shares surged in both months as
institutional investors sought to exploit the funds' yield advantage
during episodes of falling short-term market yields. This increase
was more than offset, however, by continued shrinkage in the stock
of large time deposits, particularly those issued by thrift
institutions. Like M2, M3 remains near the lower bound of its
target cone for September.
Bank credit declined at about a 3/4 percent annual rate in
August, reflecting continued weakness in loans. As in July, loans
in the three major categories--business, real estate, and consumer--
continued to fall. Loan runoffs at domestic banks continued at
about their July pace and were widespread, both geographically and
among size classes of banks; in addition, business loans at foreign
banks contracted after rising earlier this year. These declines
appear to reflect an overall weak demand for short-term business
1. After adjustment for securitization (not shown), consumer
loans posted a slight increase August, though smaller than the
meager increases observed in most previous months this year.

credit arising in part from the liquidation of inventories and from
heavy issuance in capital markets.
The contraction of real estate loans quickened in August,
even after adjustments for observed loan sales, securitizations, and
charge-offs. The weakness was widespread across the country,
although apparently somewhat less severe in the Midwest. Bank
holdings of U.S. government securities continued to increase in
August, a common pattern during the first quarter of an economic
recovery. Securities holdings may also have been boosted by the
substitution of mortgage-backed securities for mortgage loans. In
particular, call report data for the second-quarter (the most recent
data available) show that purchases of agency CMOs accounted for
nearly one-half of the total increase in U.S. government securities
during that period.
Business Finance
Borrowing by nonfinancial firms has remained weak over the
intermeeting period, as strong bond issuance offset declines in bank
loans and commercial paper. Throughout most of 1991, firms have
been shifting financing from the shorter-term markets to the equity
and long-term bond markets. Business loans at banks have declined
in each month since April; at the same time, commercial paper
outstanding has fallen nearly 10 percent, whereas the public bond
and equity markets have posted near-record volumes of gross
issuance.
The shift toward longer maturities apparently reflects
efforts by many corporations to lock in current long-term rates,
which have dropped to their lowest level since early 1987. In
addition, some issuers reportedly are lengthening debt maturities to

III-8
lessen liquidity risks. Indeed, the lengthening of debt maturities
also has been noticeable within each broad category. The average
maturity of outstanding commercial paper, for example, has increased
to forty days from thirty-five days in February. In the bond
market, offerings with maturities of thirty years or longer have
accounted for 34 percent of nonfinancial issuance during the third
quarter, compared with 21 percent over the previous year. Firms
rated Aaa and Aa, which have the greatest flexibility to time market
borrowings and change the maturity structure of their liabilities,
have since April accounted for an unusually large share of
nonfinancial borrowing in the bond market. Despite the heavy
issuance, yield spreads on investment-grade bonds have remained
relatively narrow.
The spread between yields on junk bonds and 10-year
Treasuries has remained at about 625 basis points since June, as a
combination of sizable corporate buybacks and cash inflows at high-
yield mutual funds have offset the potential impact of efforts by
insurance companies to reduce holdings of junk bonds. With the
narrowing of yield spreads in the first half of 1991, the junk bond
market has absorbed a small but steady supply of new offerings. For
example, in August, American Medical International sold a twenty-
year note with a yield spread of 569 basis points, and Dr. Pepper
Company issued a five-year secured note with a yield spread of 425
basis points. These were the first offerings of straight debt by B-
rated companies since February 1990. However, the high-yield market
remains open primarily to issuers of generally higher quality and to
those that have deleveraged.

III-9
In the market for privately placed bonds, below-investment-
grade firms are facing serious difficulties in placing bonds,
largely because of the withdrawal of life insurance companies from
the market. The withdrawal started last year with the
implementation of regulatory changes by the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners that broadened the definition of junk bonds
and increased reserves for lower-rated bonds. In addition to
regulatory changes, liquidity concerns have added to the pressure on
insurance companies to shift to investment-grade bonds, which
generally are more readily marketable than lower-grade securities.
Other investors, such as pension funds and finance companies, play
only a minor role in the private placement market, and issuers
apparently have had limited success in tapping other sources of
funds, including the equity market.
On balance, stock prices are up about 2 to 4 percent since
the August FOMC meeting, and some indexes set record highs during
the intermeeting period. With the strength in the market, the ratio
of prices to four-quarter trailing earnings for the S&P 500 has
moved to around 20 since mid-August, while the dividend-price ratio
has fallen to about 3.1 percent (chart). While the price-earnings
ratio is somewhat high compared to levels attained on the heels of
the three most recent recessions, similar levels have been recorded
during earlier recoveries (chart).
Reflecting strong share prices, public issuance of equity
by nonfinancial firms amounted to $5.4 billion in August--the second
highest month ever recorded--and continued to be heavy in September.
Favorable equity valuations and the rewards associated with
deleveraging have continued to draw a large, steady flow of IPOs and

reverse LBOs to the equity market. However, the exceptionally heavy
volume in August and September can be traced mainly to a few large
offerings by Fortune 500 corporations. For example, the August
total includes a $2.5 billion rights offering by Time-Warner, the
proceeds of which were used to reduce bank debt. September's equity
volume includes a $650 million offering by NCR, which was related to
its $7.5 billion merger with AT&T. In recent months, several
companies have issued Preferred Equity Redemption Cumulative Stock
(Percs), which are hybrid convertible securities that offer
investors a dividend yield above that on the underlying common stock
in return for a cap on appreciation potential. Together, General
Motors, K Mart, and Texas Instruments have raised just over $2
billion from Percs offerings. Given the large volume of new equity
securities and the continued cool climate for leveraged
restructurings, net equity issuance is expected to be positive in
the third quarter for the second straight quarter.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
Borrowing in marketable securities by the Treasury is
expected to run at a record $102 billion pace in the third quarter,
with about $43 billion in bills and the remainder in notes and
bonds. To accommodate this borrowing, the sizes both of weekly bill
auctions and of coupon auctions have been increased: Gross bill
auctions have been boosted $800 million, and gross sizes of some
coupon auctions have been increased as much as $500 million.
Fallout in the Treasury auctions from the investigation of
Salomon Brothers' bidding violations appears limited. Recent
auctions generally have gone smoothly, with active bidding and
strong investor interest. The Treasury recently announced several

steps that should make violations of its auction rules easier to
detect. Written confirmation of large bids by customers of primary
dealers and banks will be required before securities awarded in an
auction are delivered. Projects under way to automate the auction
process are being accelerated, and a permanent surveillance group,
consisting of representatives from the Board, the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, the Treasury, and the SEC, has been established.
Partly motivated by the need to extend the Government
Securities Act (GSA), which expires on October 1, hearings in both
the House and the Senate have examined Salomon Brothers' violations
and the regulation of the Treasury market. Rep. Edward J. Markey,
Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and
Finance, has indicated a desire to require new internal control
systems by dealers and new reporting by holders of large positions
in Treasury securities, in addition to the sales practices and
information dissemination provisions previously proposed for the
renewal of the GSA. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd and others have
introduced a bill that would make the submission of false written
statements in connection with the issue of government securities
explicitly illegal.
Salomon Brothers also admitted overstating the size of its
customer orders in conjunction with new issues of agency securities
and acknowledged purchasing agency securities on its own account
that it had reported were for its customers. Similar abuses related
to the allotment of agency securities involve several firms,
according to the SEC.

III-14
Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term municipal securities rose
sharply in August to more than $15 billion, the highest level in
four years. Municipal issuance of short-term debt also was brisk,
totaling $5.6 billion. Issuance of both short- and long-term
securities has remained strong in September. Market participants
suggest that some of the surge in borrowing is attributable to
relatively attractive yields, which stand at their lowest point
since February. While refunding announcements did pick up in mid-
September, the drop in rates has yet to boost refunding volume to an
appreciable extent. Because of the relative stability of municipal
bond yields over the past several years, most of the bonds suitable
for refinancing at current yields have already been refunded. The

modest pickup in refunding in August owed largely to an offering
from the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. 2
Connecticut has announced its intention to refinance short-
term obligations, issued to fund last year's deficit, with a $1
billion bond issue that likely will come in September. This action
prompted Standard & Poor's to lower the state's credit rating to AA-
from AA. The credit quality of many other states also continues to
decline. Moody's recently downgraded the general obligation debt of
Illinois to Aal from Aaa, the rating it had held since 1941; S&P had
taken similar action earlier in August. Both rating agencies
suggested that the state's accumulated deficit from fiscal years
1990 and 1991, amounting to more than $1 billion, left it more
vulnerable to negative developments. Other states downgraded
recently include Maine and New Jersey.
The mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, announced that she
would not raise taxes to close the city's fiscal-year 1992 budget
deficit of $16 million. To finance the deficit, the city plans to
draw on a $27 million cash reserve. At the same time, the city
announced that it plans to appeal the dismissal of its bankruptcy
filing, suggesting to market participants that the city may be
depleting the reserve in order to strengthen its case for
bankruptcy. The availability of reserve funds was the primary
factor cited by the bankruptcy judge in dismissing Bridgeport's
petition. The city's financial control board contends that the cash
reserves, formed in part by a 1988 $58 million bond issue backed the

state, helping the state balance its fiscal 1992 budget. The
purchase violates the covenants on much of the Authority's
outstanding debt, forcing a full refunding on all outstanding
debt.

state, can be used only to provide short-term liquidity, not to

Mortgage Markets
Available data on mortgage lending thus far in the third
quarter suggest that the pace of borrowing remains fairly slow.
Mortgage credit outstanding for all property types grew at an
estimated 4-1/4 percent in the second quarter, reflecting a 6-1/2
percent growth in loans on single-family properties and a 1 percent
decline in outstanding commercial mortgage credit. More recently,
however, the volume of FHA loans has declined, and home-purchase
applications at mortgage banking companies have been flat.
Meanwhile, real estate loans at commercial banks declined at a 4
percent annual rate over July and August, and initial reports for
early September indicate continued weakness.
In secondary mortgage markets, issuance of federally
related mortgage-backed securities so far in the third quarter
continues at a record pace, despite recent declines in home sales
(table). Issuance in August likely exceeded $1 billion. The higher
level of agency pass-through issuance may be attributable to
continued sales of mortgages by thrifts, the swapping of real estate
loans for CMOs by banks, the growing market shares of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, and a rising rate of mortgage refinancings. Moreover,
in June and July combined, the RTC issued $1 billion of securities
backed by single- and multi-family mortgages from the RTC's
portfolio.
In the multiclass sector, issuance declined in July for the
first time since January but subsequently rebounded to another
record level in August. For the year as a whole, CMO issuance is

expected to be at a record high. As banks and other investors have
increased their demand for CMOs and other multiclass securities,
such issues have absorbed a growing proportion of agency pass-
throughs and increased the demand for pass-through collateral.
Consequently, fixed-rate mortgages have commanded higher prices when
sold into the secondary market, enabling lenders to extend fixed-
rate mortgage credit at narrower spreads to Treasuries (chart).
Mortgage refinancing activity, which declined in early
summer as mortgage interest rates rose, apparently has revived in
recent weeks. The weekly survey of the Mortgage Bankers Association
indicates that refinancing rates have nearly doubled since the end
of June. Various industry reports also suggest that mortgage
refinancing currently accounts for one-quarter or more of total loan
applications at some lenders, with a substantial number of borrowers
switching from adjustable-rate mortgages to conventional fixed-rate
loans. Indeed, at 8.95 percent, the average commitment rate on
conforming conventional FRMs is at its lowest level since January
1978. In addition, the Department of Veterans Affairs' latest cut
in its ceiling rate on VA-guaranteed loans to 8.50 percent puts that
benchmark at its lowest point since April 1987. Moreover, despite
an initial rate advantage on ARMs of more than 2 percentage points
the reduced costs of fixed-rate financing continue to be reflected
in a large FRM share of conventional home loan originations, as
shown by the survey of major institutional lenders conducted by the
Federal Housing Finance Board (chart).

average rate of decline since the stock of debt peaked in November.
The deceleration in consumer debt last year and the contraction this
year largely reflect the general weakness in consumer durables
purchases. Auto credit has been the weakest component of
installment credit for several quarters; it declined at a 3-3/4
percent rate in July, following an 8-3/4 percent drop in the second
quarter. New-car sales in August declined from their July rate,
pointing to further runoffs in auto loans, and other indications
suggest that installment credit may have continued to decline in
August. Loans to consumers by commercial banks (adjusted to include
securitizations) rose at less than a 1 percent annual rate last
month, the weakest performance since March.
Households are showing signs of increased difficulty in
making mortgage and consumer loan payments. Delinquency rates on
consumer loans have climbed to levels higher than those in the more
severe recessions of the early 1980s; the mortgage delinquency rate
also has risen sharply but remains below the highs reached in the
mid-1980s (chart). Furthermore, personal bankruptcies have surged
far above historical rates (chart), partly in reflection of changes
in bankruptcy law and court interpretations. By establishing larger
asset exemptions, revisions to federal law in 1978, and subsequent
revisions to state law, have increased the relative attraction of
formal bankruptcy proceedings for households having trouble meeting
debt repayments.
Despite rising delinquencies, providers of consumer credit
do not appear to have altered credit availability in the past
several months. Indeed, the August reading on an index of
willingness to lend, based upon responses to the Senior Loan Officer

III-24
Opinion Survey is little changed from the May level (chart). The
index did not decline as much during the recent recession as it did
during previous recessions, and it bounced back in February,
suggesting that credit conditions for consumers have not been
unusually restrictive. Recent movements in consumer loan rates are
mixed; since May, auto loan rates have declined along with
Treasuries of comparable maturities, while personal loan rates have
moved up a few basis points. The resultant spreads remain wide
relative to much of the previous decade but are in line with such
measures after previous recessions.

Merchandise Trade
In July, the preliminary U.S merchandise trade deficit increased to
$5.9 billion from the revised June deficit of $3.8 billion. The
deterioration in July was driven by growth in imports, which increased 4
percent over the low second quarter average. Exports in July were about the
same as the second quarter average, which itself was high by recent
historical standards.

In the second quarter the merchandise trade deficit continued to
improve. This improvement was driven by strong growth in the value of
exports (about 3 percent) from the first to second quarters and only a small
increase in the value of imports (less than 1/2 percent).
Merchandise Exports. The most significant development in exports in
recent months has been the strong performance of exports of capital goods,
which rose 9-1/2 percent (not at an annual rate) in the second quarter
whereas other exports fell slightly on average.

Analysis,
The rise in capital goods exports reflected both a transitory bunching
in exports of aircraft and stronger investment demand in a number of markets
abroad. Deliveries to Germany and other developed countries accounted for
most of the increase in aircraft exports. However, various developing
countries, particularly Mexico, and Canada accounted for most of the
increase in exports of capital goods other than aircraft. Investment growth
has been strong in Mexico and clear signs of economic recovery emerged in
Canada in the second quarter. Computer exports did not play a major role in
the second quarter increase in capital goods exports when measured in
current dollars. In real terms however, computer exports increased 3
percent, and accounted for abo t one-fifth of the real increase in exports
of capital goods.
In July, aircraft export fell 10 percent from the average rate in the
second quarter, but exports of other capital goods remained at about their
high second quarter rate.
Another strong component of exports in the second quarter was
automotive products, which inc eased 18 percent from an abnormally low rate

IV-3
in the first quarter. Much of the second quarter increase was in
intermediate trade with Canada, and reflected an anticipated rise in U.S.
domestic auto sales. Part of the increase was also in exports of trucks to
replenish stocks in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
Merchandise Imports. The quantity of non-oil imports increased more
than 3-1/2 percent between the first and the second quarters and
substantially further between the second quarter average and July. The
second quarter increase was mostly attributable to computers (including
accessories and parts), which rose by 11 percent. The further increases in
July were concentrated in consumer goods, autos and computers.
In July, the value of oil imports fell 5 percent from the June rate,
the result of declines in both the price and quantity of imported oil. In
the second quarter, the value of oil imports fell 2 percent from the first
quarter, as declining prices more than offset a large increase in the
quantity of oil imported. The increase in quantity in the second quarter
was the result of a rapid runup in stocks, as market participants rebuilt
inventories in the wake of lower prices. Prior to the second quarter,
stocks had been drawn down for 8 consecutive months. Preliminary Department
of Energy data show further stockbuilding in August, suggesting that imports
remained above the 8 mb/d pace during the third quarter.
Since April, oil import prices have moved in a very narrow band. The
general firming in the spot and posted markets in June and early July should
add the same amount to the price of oil imports over the next two months.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
In July, the price of non-oil imports fell 0.5 percent (at a monthly
rate), the fourth consecutive month of decline. The decline was widespread

through all major trade categories. Export prices fell 0.7 percent in July,
following smaller decreases in the previous two months. Most of the decline
was in agricultural products. Data for August will be released September
26, and will be included in the Greenbook supplement.
In the second quarter, non-oil import prices (fixed-weight basis
reported in the GNP accounts) declined 3.7 percent at an annual rate. Price
declines occurred in all major trade categories except foods. The declines
are attributable to the combined effects of dollar appreciation and sluggish
U.S. demand during this period.
Prices of agricultural exports in the second quarter moved up 15
percent at an annual rate for the second quarter in a row. In contrast, the
average price of nonagricultural exports declined in the second quarter
following a smaller decrease in the first quarter, as price increases for
exported capital goods, automotive products, and consumer goods were more
than offset by declines in the prices of exported industrial supplies
(especially fuels, chemicals, and paper).
U.S. Current Account through 1991-Q2
The U.S. current account balance was in surplus by $12 billion at an
annual rate in the second quarter, compared with a surplus of $42 billion in
the first quarter. Unilateral transfers from coalition partners in
Operation Desert Storm were considerably smaller in the second quarter

than in the first, and more than accounted for the decrease in the surplus.
Excluding unilateral transfers, the deficit of all other current account
transactions (goods, services and investment income) narrowed by $5 billion.
Improvements in the balances for merchandise trade, military
transactions, and other services, were nearly offset by a weakening in net
investment income receipts. There was a substantial reduction in receipts
on U.S. direct investments abroad, both from petroleum and nonpetroleum
affiliates.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Banks reported a small net capital inflow in July (see line 1 of the
Summary of U.S. International Transactions table). The inflow was more than
accounted for by a reduction in bank claims on foreign public borrowers and
other nonbanks. Brazil accounted for almost $3 billion of the inflow, in
part as a result of the outcome of the negotiations with banks on interest
arrears. Repurchase agreements (RPs) with the World Bank accounted for

another $2 billion inflow (RPs are treated as loans and not purchases and
sales of securities).
Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities were very strong in July,
although below the levels of May and June (line 2c). U.S. residents
purchased net $1.8 billion of stocks in the United Kingdom and another $.6
billion of stocks in Japan. Foreigners also continued to add to their
holdings of U.S. stocks and corporate bonds in July (lines 2a and 2b).
However, more recent data indicate that new issues of Eurobonds by U.S.
corporations have fallen below the levels reached in the first half of 1991.
Net private foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities were modest in
July (line 3).
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States increased
somewhat in July (line 4). Spain, Taiwan, and Mexico continued to increase
their holdings here. In contrast, OPEC and G-10 holdings were virtually
unchanged.
Data recently released by the Department of Commerce indicate only
small direct investment capital flows in the second quarter. Foreign direct
investment in the United States was depressed in the second quarter, as it
had been in the first quarter, by lower takeover activity as well as by
negative reinvested earnings (losses) reported by U.S. affiliates in a
variety of industries including nonbank finance, insurance, real estate, and
wholesale trade (line 7). U.S. direct investment abroad dropped sharply in
the second quarter. The value of acquisitions abroad by U.S. companies has
been lower in 1991 than in 1990. The shift from large capital outflows in
the first quarter to a small outflow in the second in part reflected a shift
in the pattern of intercompany debt with European affiliates.
The adjustment of foreign-based banks to the earlier Federal Reserve
Board decision to eliminate reserve requirements on large time deposits had

a noticeable impact on several components of the U.S. international
transactions accounts in the second quarter. First, foreign-based banks
continued to expand their large time deposits outstanding in the United
States while sharply reducing their net borrowings from their own foreign
offices and from the Euro-interbank market. These adjustments resulted in a
large net capital outflow reported by banks (part of line 1 of the Summary
of U.S. International Transactions table). Second, commercial paper
outstanding in the United States issued by foreign parent banks or by their
U.S. finance affiliates declined sharply (by $9 billion and $3.5 billion
respectively during the second quarter). Without the inflow to foreign bank
finance affiliates (reported in the direct investment accounts) to pay down
commercial paper, foreign direct investment in the United States would have
been virtually zero in the second quarter (see line 7). Third, some U.S.
investors in large time deposits issued by foreign banks in the United
States appear to have shifted out of Eurodollar deposits; Federal Reserve
data show a $9 billion average decline in U.S. nonbanks' Eurodollar holdings
between March and June (see line 3 of the International Banking Data table
on previous page). Since BEA's U.S. international transactions data do not
adequately cover changes in U.S. nonbanks' holdings of foreign commercial
paper and deposits, the decline in these holdings in the second quarter
contributed significantly to the large positive statistical discrepancy in
the U.S. international transactions accounts (line 10).
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average value of the dollar declined about 5-1/2 percent
since the August 20 FOMC meeting. A large part of that decline occurred in
the first two days of the intermeeting period, as the sharp runup of the
dollar in response to the ouster of Soviet President Gorbachev was reversed
when it became clear that the coup attempt had failed. The dollar moved

lower later in the period amid disappointment with the pace of the U.S.
recovery and expectations that continued weakness in U.S. money growth would
prompt the Federal Reserve to ease. These expectations were realized on
September 13, but, because they had been so widespread, there was little
further rate movement in reaction to the discount rate cut itself or the
decline in the federal funds rate. In the days following, however, the
dollar drifted somewhat lower amid commentary that the Fed may ease further.
The dollar's decline was more pronounced against the mark--7 percent--
than against the yen--3-1/4 percent. Because of Germany's ties with Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union, the mark was particularly volatile during the
days of the coup, and part of the mark's stronger performance can be
explained by the coup's failure and perhaps also the resulting improvement
in the outlook for political reform and trade in the region. Changes in
interest rate differentials during the intermeeting period also contributed
to the mark's relative strength. The interest rate on three-month CDs in
Japan declined 70 basis points in the period since the August FOMC meeting,
while the comparable rate in Germany declined only 10 basis points. The
movement in the Japanese interest rate reflects some actual easing of
monetary policy there as well as market expectations that further easing is
on the way, while further monetary tightening in Germany appears to be on
hold. The yield on the bellwether bond in Japan moved down nearly 45 basis
points during the intermeeting period to 6.05 percent, while the bellwether
yield in Germany declined only 15 basis points to 8.43 percent.
Sterling declined about 1-1/4 percent against the mark during the
intermeeting period. Sterling had been buoyed early in the period by polls
that showed the Conservative Party pulling ahead of Labour and by favorable
press reports on Prime Minister Major's trips to Moscow, Beijing, and Hong
Kong. The pound remained firm against the mark despite a sooner-than-

IV-14
expected 1/2-point cut in the Bank of England's money-market dealing rate on
September 4. However, the bullish sentiment was overturned subsequently as
market participants began to focus on the possibility that Prime Minister
Major might call an early election and push U.K. interest rates down further
prematurely. The likelihood of this scenario diminished late in the period,
however, as the most recent polls show Labour once again ahead of the
Conservatives by a small margin. Both the three-month interbank interest
rate in the United Kingdom and the bellwether yield declined 45 basis points
during the intermeeting period to about 10.30 percent and 9.55 percent,
respectively.
The Desk did not intervene during the
period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent monthly data suggest that economic activity grew slowly in
foreign industrial countries during the third quarter, following positive
surprises in recently released national accounts data for the second
quarter. After double-digit growth in the first quarter, GNP growth in
Japan and western Germany fell sharply in the second quarter, although the
decline in Japanese growth was less than expected. Monthly indicators
suggest that economic activity in these two countries continued to grow
slowly in the third quarter. Canadian GNP and French marketable GDP grew
strongly in the second quarter, but other indicators do not confirm a robust
recovery. The recession in the United Kingdom continued into the second
quarter, but other recent data show suggest the start of recovery.
Recent data on prices show some gains in reducing inflation abroad.
Inflation in both Canada and the United Kingdom has declined in recent
months partially in response to the lagged impact of their recessions.

IV-18
After a sharp increase in July, due in part to increases in excise taxes,
west German inflation moderated in August.
The pan-German current account deficit did not decline significantly
in the second quarter despite the ending of payments connected with the Gulf
War. Japanese trade and current account surpluses continue to increase.
Individual Country Notes. Recent indicators of economic activity in
Japan have been mixed. Real GNP (s.a.) increased 2 percent (a.r.) in the
second quarter, following very rapid 11 percent growth in the first quarter.
Domestic demand growth eased to 4 percent in the second quarter from 5.2
percent in the first quarter. Consumption grew strongly (7.2 percent),
while plant and equipment investment was weak (down 0.2 percent) and housing
investment dropped further (down 24.3 percent). Inventory investment made
only a small contribution to second-quarter growth (0.3 percent). The main
reason for the slowing of overall growth between the first and second
quarters was a swing in the contribution of net exports from positive 5.6
percent to negative 2.1 percent. Exports declined 10.6 percent in the
second quarter, while imports were down 1.1 percent.
Other recent indicators of activity, on balance, have been suggested
some weakening. Industrial production (s.a.) increased 3.2 percent in July,
but this followed a 2.8 percent drop in June. The unemployment rate (s.a.)
rose 0.1 percentage point in July to 2.2 percent. The capacity utilization
rate (s.a.) fell 3.9 percent in June and was 5.6 percent below its peak
level of last October. The Bank of Japan's latest short-term ("Tankan")
corporate survey indicated that perceptions of future business conditions
declined further in August. The index of leading indicators (s.a.) was
below the level designated as indicating weakness for the eleventh
consecutive month in July. New manufacturing orders (s.a.) dropped sharply
in June, falling 13.5 percent below their level of last December. Housing

IV-19
starts (s.a.) declined in July for the fifth month out of the last six and
were 15.7 percent lower than in December last year. New passenger car
registrations (s.a.) increased slightly in August, but were below their
year-earlier level for the sixth consecutive month. The strongest recent
indicator has been retail sales (s.a.), which jumped 4.8 percent in June to
6.9 percent above their level at the end of last year.
Inflationary pressures appear generally to have remained moderate in
recent months. The consumer price index for the Tokyo area increased 0.4
percent in August, and its 12-month increase rose to 3.6 percent. However,
over the first eight months of this year, Tokyo consumer prices, seasonally
adjusted and excluding perishable food items, increased at only a 2.5
percent annual rate. Wholesale prices were unchanged in August, and their
12-month rise was only 0.1 percent.
The trade surplus (s.a.) increased further in August. Over the first
eight months of the year, the trade surplus was $74 billion (a.r.), well
above the $57 billion surplus in the same period last year. The volume of
imports and exports increased 3 percent over this period, while the unit
value of imports fell 6 percent, due in large part to lower oil prices, and
the unit value of exports declined only 2 percent.
Real GNP in western Germany (adjusted for seasonal and calendar
variations) fell at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter,
after increasing 10.1 percent in the first quarter. Final domestic demand
fell sharply. After increasing 87 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter
because of mild weather, seasonally adjusted construction investment fell 32
percent in the second quarter. Private consumption was also weak due, in
part, to an increase in payroll taxes. West German exports (including
shipments to eastern Germany) fell 7.7 percent in the second quarter, while

IV-20
imports increase 2.6 percent. These declines in final demand were partially
offset by an increase in inventory investment.
Other data are mixed, but they suggest that growth remained depressed
in the third quarter. Although industrial production in western Germany
(s.a.) fell 1.2 percent in July, it had increased 3.8 percent in June, and
the average level of industrial production for June and July was 2.8 percent
above the average level for April and May. The volume of new orders for
west German manufactured goods (s.a.) fell slightly in July after increasing
strongly in May and June; foreign orders have out performed domestic orders
over the past four months. In July, the volume of retail sales (s.a.) in
western Germany fell 0.2 percent, after increasing 1.8 percent in the
previous month. The west German unemployment rate (s.a.) was unchanged in
August after increasing 0.1 percent in July to 6.4 percent.
Official east German unemployment was unchanged in August at 12.1
percent, after increasing 2.6 percentage points in July. The July increase
was expected as a number of important employment guarantees expired at the
end of June. Labor-market conditions appear to have improved over the past
two months as the number of workers engaged in government subsidized
"short-time" work has fallen by more than the increase in unemployment. It
now appears that recovery in the construction sector is well underway. New
construction orders in eastern Germany have increased steadily since
February, and May's level was 27.5 percent above the average level for the
second half of 1990.
West German consumer prices were unchanged in August, after increasing
0.5 and 0.9 percent in June and July respectively. On a year-over-year
basis, consumer-price inflation fell from 4.4 percent in July to 4.1 percent
in August. Excluding energy products, west German consumer prices (s.a.)
increased 0.4 percent in August, after monthly increases of 0.6 percent in

IV-21
both June and July. West German wholesale prices fell 0.9 percent in August
after increasing 0.8 percent in July. On a year-over-year basis WPI
inflation was 1.3 percent in August compared with 3.1 percent in July.
Unit labor costs in western Germany continue to accelerate. Average
hourly earnings in western Germany (s.a.) increased 3.2 percent in the
second quarter, up from a quarterly increase of 2.7 percent in the first
quarter. In contrast, output per hour in west German industry (s.a.) was
essentially unchanged in the second quarter, after increasing 1.5 percent in
the first quarter.
The combined German trade balance (s.a.) deteriorated slightly in
July, falling to a deficit of $2.7 billion (a.r.). For the second quarter
as a whole, the trade deficit was $1.8 billion, compared with a trade
surplus of $18.2 billion in the first quarter. (The last time western
Germany had a quarterly trade deficit (s.a.) was in 1965.) The combined
German current account (s.a.) improved slightly in the second quarter. The
current account deficit fell from $27.6 billion (a.r.) in the first quarter
to $23.1 billion in the second quarter. The current account showed a small
surplus in the first quarter, however, when payments related to the Gulf
war, most of which occurred in the first quarter, are excluded. On a
non-seasonally adjusted basis the current account deteriorated further in
July.
Marketable GDP (s.a.) in France rose 3.2 percent (a.r.) in the second
quarter. (This preliminary measure excludes most government services.) The
second-quarter increase was largely due to strong net exports. Consumption
and investment made small positive contributions, while a decline in
inventories made a significant negative contribution. Industrial production
(s.a.) remained constant in June, and the unemployment rate (s.a.) increased
0.1 percentage point in July to 9.5 percent.

IV-22
French consumer prices in August were 3 percent above their level a
year earlier. This decrease in inflation from 3.4 percent in July is
largely due to the fact that last August's energy price increase is no
longer reflected in the 12-month change of the CPI.
France's 1992 draft budget, adopted on September 18, maintains the
restrictive fiscal stance of previous years. Expenditures are budgeted to
rise 3.1 percent, only slightly more than the projected 1992 inflation rate.
The target budget deficit has been set at FF89 billion, about 1.3 percent of
GDP and well below the current estimate for the 1991 deficit of FF100
billion. The budget offsets significant increases in expenditures on
education and research with a cut in real defense expenditures. Associated
with the budget is a reform of corporate income taxation, in which a single
tax rate of 34 percent is applied to retained earnings, dividend payments,
and capital gains. President Mitterrand announced on September 11 that
private-sector firms would be permitted to acquire a stake in public
enterprises of up to 49.9 percent. This partial renunciation of his "Ni-Ni"
policy (neither privatization, nor nationalization) reflects the need to
increase capitalization of public enterprises without resorting to
government transfers.
In Italy, preliminary data indicate that industrial production (s.a.)
rose about 2 percent in June, after rising 1.1 percent in May. Consumer
demand appears to have increased recently; auto sales were up 7.2 percent in
August and 5.6 percent in July on a year-over-year basis.
Consumer prices in August were 6.3 percent above their level a year
earlier, down considerably from the 6.7 percent rise of July and the 6.9
percent rise of June. This slowing of inflation reflects the fact that
higher energy prices arising from the August 1990 Gulf crisis and higher
indirect taxes introduced a year ago are no longer captured in the 12-month

IV-23
change in the CPI. Wholesale price inflation continued to slow in July,
rising 6.9 percent above the level a year earlier, down from 7.2 percent in
the previous month.
Italy's 1991 cumulative trade deficit (s.a.) was $13 billion (a.r.)
through July, up from $10.5 billion during the same period of 1990.
Italy's fiscal deficit is running well above the government's target,
in part because of the slowing economy. During the first eight months of
1991, the deficit was reportedly 82 trillion lire ($66 billion), about 25
percent above its level during the same period last year. Most observers
expect the actual 1991 deficit to be 140 to 150 trillion lire, or roughly 10
to 10-1/2 percent of GDP, well above the deficit target of 9.1 percent of
GDP.
The United Kingdom has been in a recession since the third quarter of
1990. Real GDP (s.a.) fell 2.4 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter and is
3.7 percent below its level at the onset of the recession. Private
consumption was down slightly in the second quarter, and gross fixed capital
formation fell 11.4 percent. Significant destocking of inventories occurred
for the third consecutive quarter. Exports grew strongly (13 percent) and
imports were up (3.4 percent) for the first time in a year.
Recent data provide some support for the view that the United Kingdom
is emerging from its recession, but the recovery is still tentative.
Housing starts rose 12 percent in May-July compared with the previous three
months. Retail sales were up strongly in June and July, but fell back in
August. Industrial output of manufactured products rose gradually between
May and July, but remained 5.2 percent below its pre-recession level of July
1990.
The inflation rate has dropped considerably during the past year.
After peaking at a year-over-year rate of 10.9 percent in October 1990,

IV-24
consumer-price inflation fell to 4.7 percent this August. Almost half of
the decline in measured inflation has stemmed from cuts in mortgage rates.
Producers' output prices inched up in August to a level 5.6 percent above a
year ago. This year-on-year increase is the lowest since March 1990. As
unemployment swelled (to a rate of 8.5 percent in August), the rate of wage
inflation fell to 7-1/2 percent (year/year) in July compared with a peak
rate of 10-1/4 percent a year earlier.
The recession has led to a narrowing of Britain's current account
deficit. The cumulative current account deficit (s.a.) for the first eight
months of 1991 was $12.2 billion (a.r.) compared with a $31.2 deficit for
the same period in 1990.
In Canada, real GDP (s.a.) rose 4.9 percent (a.r.) in the second
quarter, ending four consecutive quarters of decline; the level of GNP was
still 1.7 percent below its peak in the first quarter of 1990, however. The
stronger-than-expected rebound in output was led by a 20.6 percent increase
in exports, a 7.8 percent increase in real consumption expenditures, and a
6.4 percent increase in investment. Final domestic demand grew 6 percent
but inventories dropped sharply.
Recent monthly data, however, suggest that the recovery is fragile.
Housing starts (s.a.) fell 3.2 percent in August, manufacturer's shipments
fell 0.3 percent (s.a.) in July, and retail sales (s.a.) were virtually
unchanged in June. Unemployment (s.a.) increased from 10.5 percent to 10.6
percent in August, a figure exceeding any recorded during the recession.
Industrial production (s.a.) increased 0.4 percent in June, however, and new
car sales (s.a.) were up 0.8 percent in July.
Recent price data suggest that the government's anti-inflation efforts
are beginning to bear fruit. The consumer price index posted consecutive
increases of only 0.1 percent in July and August, but twelve-month inflation

IV-25
fell 0.5 percentage points in July to 5.8 percent due to the surge in oil
prices in August 1990. Industrial product prices fell 0.3 percent in July,
the sixth straight monthly decline. Private sector wage settlements (s.a.)
increased 0.4 percent in June and 0.2 percent in July.
The current account deficit (s.a.) was virtually unchanged in the
second quarter at $19.3 billion (a.r.). A slight increase in the
merchandise trade surplus (s.a.) to $11.2 billion (a.r.) was offset by an
increasing deficit in non-merchandise transactions.
Developments in East European Countries
Economic adjustment in Eastern Europe is progressing. In recent
months inflation rates in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic have declined to their lowest levels since reform programs were put
in place, and trade with the west continues to expand. However, data for
July and August provide little evidence of a turnaround in economic activity
in the region. On September 6, EC Ministers tabled a proposed package of
trade liberalization measures that would have sharply expanded Eastern
European access to EC markets, particularly for agriculture and textiles.
In Poland, industrial sales were stable in August following a sharp
drop in July. For the first eight months of the year, industrial sales were
off 22 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. The August
unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage points to 9.8 percent. One positive
development was that monthly inflation was 0.1 percent in July and 0.6
percent in August. These inflation rates are the lowest since the start of
the adjustment effort 1-1/2 years ago. Also, the trade balance registered a
small surplus in August, the fourth consecutive monthly surplus following
the May devaluation.
A weakening economy, coupled with the poor financial condition of
state enterprises, contributed to a shortfall in government revenues and

IV-26
caused Poland to miss its end-June IMF budget targets. Measures proposed by
the government that would put the economic program on track have run into
heavy opposition in the Parliament (SEJM), which has also stalled
government-sponsored legislation on privatization and central banking
reform. It is unlikely that these measures will be approved before the SEJM
elections on October 27.
In Hungary, industrial production contracted 21 percent in the first
seven months of 1991 compared with the same period a year ago. The decline
was concentrated in large state firms, while output of small firms (mostly
private) increased. The unemployment rate rose to 5.2 percent in August
from 4.6 percent in July. Inflation was 0.9 percent in July and has
declined steadily since the beginning of the year.
In the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, industrial production was
essentially stable in July, but it was 22 below year-earlier levels. The
unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent in July from 3.8 percent in June. One
bright spot was that prices fell 0.1 percent in July. Prices appear to have
stabilized after a 25 percent increase since January when a broad
liberalization was implemented. With the decline in inflation, the Central
Bank announced a lowering of the discount rate by 1/2 percentage point to
9-1/2 percent.
The dramatic events in the Soviet Union in late August have further
complicated an already fragile economic situation. Industrial production
has fallen 6.4 percent in the first eight months of 1991 compared with the
same period in 1990, and GNP is expected to fall 15 percent in 1991. Soviet
trade with the West has fallen from already low levels, and there are fears
of a collapse of inter-republic trade in coming months. Despite severe
import compression, recent events have raised concerns about whether the

IV-27
Soviet Union's $60-$65 billion external debt will continue to be serviced.
(Germany remains the largest single creditor of the Soviet Union.)
Economic situation in other countries
The rise in Mexico's real GDP in the first half of this year exceeded
expectations, but the rate of inflation continued to decline. An
improvement in Mexico's public finances allowed the Bank of Mexico to ease
banks' liquidity reserve requirements in September. Brazil paid $470
million in mid-September to commercial banks pursuant to an arrears
agreement that was signed last April. The IMF staff are now exploring the
possibilities for negotiating a program. However, it remains to be seen
whether Brazil can present a policy package that will meet IMF requirements.
The macroeconomic situation in Argentina has continued to improve, with the
inflation rate declining, industrial activity recovering, and money market
rates dropping. Peru made substantial progress in repairing its relations
with the international financial community. In mid-September the IMF
approved a "rights accumulation" program for Peru, and the Paris Club
rescheduled $6.6 billion of Peru's foreign debt. The Philippines missed
some end-June IMF program targets, and an IMF Board review has been
postponed to November. Real GDP increased rapidly in Korea in the first
half of the year, but the current account deficit rose to a record level.
Taiwan's authorities eased monetary policy in September to stimulate private
domestic investment and to decrease pressure on the appreciating NT dollar.
Individual Country Notes. Mexico's real GDP was 4.8 percent higher in
the first half of this year than in the same period in 1990. This rate of
increase exceeded expectations. However, the monthly CPI increase has
continued to decline. In August, the CPI was 0.7 percent higher than in
July and 20.7 percent higher than a year earlier. The merchandise trade
deficit for the first half was $2 billion, compared with a $0.7 million

IV-28
surplus in the same period in 1990. The current account deficit was $4.6
billion.
Interest rates eased further in August, but turned up late in the
month and the first half of September. At the September 17 auction of
treasury securities, the rate for 28-day bills was 17.25 percent, 150 basis
points higher than at the low point on August 27. In part, the recent
upturn in rates--which occurred in spite of heavy open market purchases by
the Bank of Mexico--was associated with a scramble by commercial banks to
cover end-of-month liquidity reserve requirements, when the first payment on
the privatization of the National Bank of Mexico (BANAMEX), equal to 20
percent of the purchase price, fell due on September 2. A large brokerage
house, Acciones y Valores, won the bidding for BANAMEX, with a bid
equivalent to almost $3.2 billion for about 70 percent of the stock. The
rest of the stock is held by the private sector.
On September 12, the Bank of Mexico eased the banks' liquidity reserve
requirement by instituting an absolute ceiling in terms of peso amounts on
their required holdings of government securities. The Bank explained that
the improvement in the country's public finances made it unnecessary to
require banks to continue buying government securities. This is expected to
result in a stimulation of additional bank credit to the private sector,
which may prove to be inconsistent with the need to avoid overheating of the
economy.
In the mid-term congressional elections held August 18, the PRI (the
government party) increased its majority in the lower house of the Mexican
Congress from 52 percent to approximately 64 percent, mainly at the expense
of the leftist opposition parties.
In late August, Brazil opened negotiations to restructure its $60
billion medium- and long-term external debt to commercial banks. Creditor

IV-29
banks responded very favorably to the proposal and Brazilian debt in the
secondary market rose from 35 cents to 39.5 cents on the dollar. Several
options in the proposal envision enhancements on the principal, which are
likely to require that Brazil agree to an IMF program. Brazil also paid
$470 million in mid-September pursuant to the interest arrears agreement
that was signed last April. The amount includes 30 percent of interest due
plus a cash payment. The remaining payments on the $2 billion cash
settlement will be spread out through the end of the year.
Discussions with IMF staff on a possible program are in progress, but
it remains to be seen whether Brazil can assemble a policy package
acceptable to the IMF. Due to continuing budget deficits and the public's
reluctance to hold government debt, Brazil is currently in a severe
budgetary crisis. In August and September, the government returned about $1
billion in funds it had frozen in March 1990, but imposed high commercial
bank reserve requirements in order to force the domestic banks to hold
public debt. The government's expected return of an estimated $24 billion
(equivalent) in frozen savings over the next twelve months is putting strong
pressures on government spending.
Reflecting the budget deficits, the rate of inflation has been rising
and is expected to increase further. Consumer prices rose 15.5 percent in
August, and are expected to rise by 18-19 percent in September. Economic
activity appears to have risen in recent months, although it is below levels
attained in 1989. The Sao Paulo index of industrial activity rose 5.4
percent in July compared with June, and was 6 percent above its level in
July 1990. Brazil's cumulative trade surplus through July was $7.9 billion,
compared with $7.5 for the same period in 1990.
The status of budgetary reforms proposed by the Brazilian economic
team is uncertain. Many of the proposed reforms require changes in Brazil's

IV-30
constitution, which need a three-fifths majority vote in congress.
President Collor rejected congress' proposal to reindex wages, and a new law
with partial wage controls was passed earlier this month. Over the past few
weeks, there have been rumors that the present economic team that has been
in power since mid-May would be replaced and that price controls would be
imposed once again.
In Argentina, the macroeconomic situation has continued to improve.
Consumer price inflation on a monthly basis declined from 2.6 percent in
July to 1.3 percent in August, the smallest monthly increase since 1974.
Monthly short-term call money rates have declined to close to 1 percent per
month, also very low by historical standards. In recent months industrial
activity has begun to recover from its low in 1990, although it has yet to
regain the levels reached in the mid-1980s.
Based on increased optimism concerning the prospects for the
stabilization program, the secondary market price of the government's BONEX
(10-year dollar-denominated bonds) has increased from 65 percent of face
value in April to 80 percent in recent days. During the same period, the
secondary market price of commercial bank debt increased from 20 percent to
almost 40 percent of face value, while the Buenos Aires' stock exchange
index increased by more than 80 percent. On September 10, the Argentine
government successfully issued a two-year Eurobond offering underwritten by
J.P. Morgan. On the basis of strong initial demand, the size of the
offering was increased from $100 million to $300 million. The bonds will
pay 11 percent annually, or about 500 basis points above LIBOR. On
September 18 the Paris Club rescheduled $1.6 billion in Argentine bilateral
debt, covering most interest and all principal coming due through June 1992,
over 10 years with six years grace. As part of the agreement, Argentina

IV-31
must clear by the end of 1991 about $267 million in arrears to the Paris
Club creditors.
The key to sustaining the stabilization program is balancing the
budget. Under the IMF stand-by arrangement approved at the end of July,
Argentina is projected to achieve a fiscal surplus, excluding interest
payments and capital revenues, of 1 percent of GDP, or about $350 million,
during the third quarter of 1991. A $30 million deficit was registered in
July, although, in part, this reflected the payment of about $200 million in
traditional mid-year bonuses to government employees. While the July
shortfall was offset by receipts of $240 million from the sale of oil
concessions, it is clear that various fiscal problems must still be
addressed. These include the financial problems of the provincial
governments and the social security system, as well as continued, widespread
tax evasion.
On September 13, Peru cleared its arrears with the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) with the help of a four-year loan from the Latin
American Reserve Fund, which is funded by regional central banks, and is
scheduled to receive the first $100 million disbursement of an IDB foreign
trade sector loan in October. On September 12, the International Monetary
Fund approved a "rights accumulation" program for Peru for up to a maximum
of SDR 623.7 million (about $825 million). Under such a program, an IMF
member with protracted arrears can earn "rights," based on sustained
performance over a certain period monitored by the IMF, toward future
financing once its arrears to the IMF have been cleared. In addition, on
September 17, the Paris Club rescheduled $6.6 billion of Peru's foreign
debt, allowing repayment over 20 years, among other terms.
The Philippines was unable to draw in August the $50 million third
tranche of its 18-month stand-by arrangement with the IMF because it

IV-32
exceeded the base money target at the end of June. Accordingly, a review of
the program by the IMF Board was postponed to November. On August 30, a
tentative agreement was reached with the foreign commercial banks on a
restructuring of part of the $5.3 billion in public sector commercial bank
debt. The agreement includes four options: new loans through the purchase
of 17-year bonds and the conversion of existing Philippine debt into bonds;
new loans through cofinancing with the Asian Development Bank; and swaps of
outstanding loans either into 15-year interest-reduction bonds, or 25-year
collateralized interest-reduction bonds.
Korea's real GDP rose 9.2 percent in the first half of 1991, led by an
investment boom. The current account deficit rose to a record $7 billion in
the first seven months of 1991 from $1 billion in the year-earlier period,
as a steep rise in imports of oil and capital goods more than offset a
recovery in exports. In order to slow import growth, the government has
reduced the private sector's access to foreign currency loans. Rapid growth
of economic activity in excess of potential has continued to put pressure on
consumer prices, which were up 9.5 percent in August over a year earlier.
In Taiwan, economic activity has picked up moderately this year due to
stronger exports and rising public investment. In the first eight months of
1991, exports increased 12.7 percent, with large increases in exports to
Europe and to Asia, particularly China (through Hong Kong). The cumulative
trade surplus was $7.9 billion over that period, essentially unchanged from
the same period last year. Inflation has decelerated this year and consumer
prices were only 3.3 percent higher in August than a year earlier. On
September 9 and September 20, Taiwan's central bank cut its rediscount rate
by a total of 3/4 of a percentage point to 6.6 percent and reduced reserve
requirements.
