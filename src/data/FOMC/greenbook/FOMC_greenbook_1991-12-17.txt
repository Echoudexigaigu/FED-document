created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The recovery in economic activity has stalled. Payroll
employment fell substantially in November, and industrial production
likely turned down. Consumer spending has softened, commercial
construction still is in free-fall, and the federal and state and
local sectors continue to be mired in budgetary imbalances.
Elsewhere, spending for housing and business equipment has been
rising, but the current momentum is uncertain. The incoming data on
wages and prices have continued to suggest that inflation is
trending down.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor market conditions weakened in November. Private payroll
employment, which had edged down 30,000 in October, fell an
additional 230,000 last month. And, despite a slight
lengthening of the workweek, which came mainly in retail trade, the
aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers slipped
another 0.1 percent last month, after a drop of 0.7 percent in
October; these declines left the average level of hours worked in
October and November about equal to that for the third quarter.
Job losses were widespread in November. In manufacturing, a
third month of decline brought the cumulative reduction of factory
jobs since August to 100,000. Employment in retail trade also was
down again last month--and at a much faster pace than in the
previous month. In construction, underlying weakness was compounded
during the November survey week by shutdowns due to bad weather; the
1. The Bureau of Labor Statistics points out that introduction of
new seasonal factors affected the size of the November payroll
decline. The BLS used updated seasonal factors on the November
data, but reported October employment based on the old factors. If
the new factors also had been used to adjust the October data, the
November reduction in total payroll employment would have been about
170,000 rather than 240,000. A consistent set of seasonal factors
will be introduced with the benchmark employment revision in the
spring.

result was an unusually large employment decline of 95,000.
Employment in wholesale trade continued to trend lower in November,
and employment in business services turned down after three months
of increase. The number of jobs in health services continued to
grow, however.
The monthly survey of households also showed a weakening of
labor market conditions in November. Total employment fell 200,000.
In addition, the size of the labor force shrank 300,000 last month
and was only fractionally above its year-earlier level. The absence
of growth in the labor force has reduced the upward pressure on the
unemployment rate, which held steady in November at 6.8 percent.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
After remaining essentially unchanged from July to October, the
index of industrial production likely fell appreciably in November.
Motor vehicle assemblies dropped about 5 percent last month to an
annual rate of 9.5 million units, and weekly data for selected other
industrial products and materials were flat, on balance. In
addition, many other manufacturers, particularly those in durable
goods industries, trimmed their labor input further. 2 New orders
for industrial products also have been sluggish, with the staff's
measure of real adjusted durable goods orders edging down a bit, on
net, over the past few months (chart). With production declining in
November, capacity utilization likely fell to its lowest level since
last spring.
2. Data from the November establishment survey, adjusted using
FRB seasonal factors, show a decline of 0.2 percent in total hours
worked by production workers in manufacturing excluding motor
vehicles (chart). However, when industry detail on hours are
aggregated using value added weights--consistent with the
construction of the industrial production index--hours worked in
manufacturing excluding motor vehicles were down 0.7 percent in
November.

1. Figures beyond November are based on current manufacturers'
schedules.
Production restraint in the auto sector now appears likely to
persist into the early months of 1992. In late November, motor
vehicle manufacturers slashed the output of domestic cars and trucks
planned for December and the fir t quarter of next year; the cuts
likely were a response to the weak pace of sales, the plunge in
consumer confidence, and slow ordering by dealers. The level of car
and truck assemblies now planned for December is just a touch above
the November level; assembly plans for the first quarter of next
year are, on average, a little below the November pace.
Production has slackened in other industries as well,
especially those for durable goods. In October, production of
consumer durable goods other than autos and light trucks dropped for
the first time since February, and production of durable materials
contracted. Output of construction supplies has been falling since
mid-year, after strong growth during the spring. Cutbacks in
defense and space production have proceeded almost without
interruption for more than a year now.
The production of business equipment other than motor vehicles
has shown little improvement since its low in March as production of
office and computing machinery and industrial equipment has remained
weak. The early indicators for November provide no hint of a
significant upturn. The strike at Caterpillar reduced output of

business equipment by about 0.5 percent last month, and production-
worker hours remain sluggish, on balance, in other equipment-
producing industries.
Personal Income and Consumption
Assessment ofrecent trends in real income and consumption is
hampered this month by the absence of rebenchmarked monthly data;
those data are not scheduled to be available until December 23.
Assuming, however, that the patterns of change in the existing
monthly data are accurate to at least a first order of
approximation, the picture in recent months is basically one of
sluggish consumption and the virtual absence of real income
growth.3  Taking the data as they stand, real personal
consumption expenditures measured in 1982 dollars fell 0.4 percent
in October, putting its level in that month slightly below the
average level for the third quarter, which itself has been revised
down since the last Greenbook. The October drop was concentrated in
expenditures on motor vehicles.
The weakness of consumption has been paralleled by virtually
nonexistent income growth. Between June and October, real
disposable personal income rose at an average monthly rate of less
than 0.1 percent. Although the October data did show a rise in
nominal disposable income of almost $10 billion at an annual rate,
more than all of this increase was attributable to a temporary bulge
in farm subsidy payments and a $10 billion rise in transfer income.
Total wages and salaries fell by about $5 billion in October, the
first drop since July, and interest income continued to contract.
3. Nominal retail sales, which were not affected by the NIPA
revisions, declined in October, and the estimates for the two
previous months were revised down. Retail control, a category that
excludes autos and other nonconsumption items, declined in August,
September, and October.

In November, wages and salaries appear to have increased moderately
in nominal terms.
The weakness in spending on motor vehicles extended into
November. Unit sales of autos and light trucks, which had dropped
from a 12.9 million unit annual rate in September to a 12.1 million
unit rate in October, retraced only a little of that decline in
November (chart). September sales of domestic models had been
boosted by temporary purchasing incentives on light trucks, and
probably by temporary increases in sales to the daily rental fleets.
However, even allowing for these special factors, sales of domestic
models have been soft recently. Sales of imported autos and trucks
also have been sluggish; sales of imported cars declined further in
November to the lowest level since January, while sales of imported
light trucks were flat.
Consumer confidence took another sharp step downward in
November according to both the Conference Board and the Michigan
Survey Research Center (SRC) indexes. The Conference Board index
fell below its low point of the 1981-82 recession, and the SRC
index retreated to the levels of last winter. Consumers'
assessments of their current financial situation, employment
opportunities, and business conditions soured further last month, as
did their views about the future. Also, consumers again expressed
reluctance to use savings or credit for major purchases.
The comprehensive revision of the NIPA has altered the recent
pattern of consumption growth a little. Real personal consumption
expenditures now are estimated to have grown at annual rates of 1.4
percent in the second quarter and 2.3 percent in the third quarter
of this year, in each case more than 1 percentage point below the
previously estimated growth rates. The downward revisions were
mainly in nondurables and services. Revisions to the consumption

data for previous years generally were small. In particular, the
data still show a huge rise in household spending on durable goods
over the course of the 1980s. Although this buildup apparently left
households well-stocked with these goods coming into the 1990s,
during the past year purchases of durables have dropped well below
the earlier trend.
The level of the personal saving rate was revised up over most
of the last decade, but it continues to exhibit a sharp drop from
1981 through 1987 and a moderate rebound thereafter (chart). For
the period from mid-1990 to the third quarter of 1991, the revised
saving rate shows little net change, in contrast to the previously
estimated decline of 1 percentage point. The revised pattern since
early 1990 is more in line with movements in the fundamental
determinants of the saving rate over the period--such as the limited
increase in the ratio of wealth to income and flagging consumer
confidence--than was the case prior to the revisions. As before the
revision, however, the recent saving rate is low by historical
standards, suggesting that there is little room for increased
consumption from a downward adjustment of saving.
Business Fixed Investment
With the revision to the NIPA, the reported magnitude of the
recovery in real outlays for producers' durable equipment since the
first quarter has been muted considerably, while spending for
nonresidential construction is still estimated to have been on a
4steep downtrend over the past year. Recent indicators suggest
4. However, the level of nonresidential construction outlays was
adjusted up markedly in the new estimates; in current dollars, the
average level of outlays now reported for 1990 is 35 percent above
that previously estimated, with the largest upward revision in
industrial construction. BEA made this adjustment because the 1982
Census of Construction indicated that payments to contractors were
much higher than the nominal value of construction put-in-place,
which had been used in previous benchmarks to tie down the level of
nonresidential construction.

that aggregate real outlays for equipment have flattened out during
the current quarter and that nonresidential construction has
weakened further.
In 1987 dollars, equipment spending is estimated to have risen
at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent between the first and third
quarters of 1991, well below the 11-1/2 percent increase published
before the benchmark revision. The weaker recovery mainly reflects
the shift in the base year for real outlays from 1982 to 1987, which
reduced the weight attached to the sizable rise in purchases of
computing equipment since the first quarter. Apart from this weight
shift, the benchmark revision conveys roughly the same picture of
equipment spending as did the earlier data. Business spending for
motor vehicles still is estimated to have risen from the depressed
first-quarter level, while outlays for most other types of equipment
(except computers) remained sluggish through the third quarter.
Recent indicators of equipment spending have been mixed and
point to little change in total real outlays in the current quarter.
Shipments of office and computing equipment jumped 12.7 percent in
October, the largest monthly increase in nearly eleven years. This
rise meshes with reports that IBM began large-scale shipments of its
new generation of mainframe computers in late September. These
units were ordered as much as a year ago. More recently, though,
bookings for computing equipment have been lackluster: the level of
nominal orders in October, while up sharply from that of September,
differed little from the average over the preceding six months. For
nondefense capital goods excluding computing equipment (and aircraft
and parts), orders have trended up in a choppy fashion since March.
Shipments of this broad aggregate of equipment have risen somewhat
on net since July, leaving the October level of shipments about 1-
1/3 percent above the third-quarter average. In contrast, purchases

of heavy trucks fell 8-1/2 percent in October, and business spending
on cars and light trucks likely has declined as well since the third
quarter.
Signs of weakness also have emerged in domestic demand for
aircraft. Orders from domestic carriers for Boeing commercial
aircraft have plummeted since mid-year, and American Airlines
announced last month that it was scaling back capital expansion
plans through 1995. Although Boeing's backlog of domestic aircraft
orders has begun to contract, domestic deliveries could rise
somewhat during the first half of next year, because of the increase
in monthly production of 757s scheduled to begin in January.
However, the longer-term outlook for aircraft deliveries is
decidedly more negative. Boeing already has announced its intention
to cut the monthly production of 737s by 20 percent next September,
and recent comments by company officials suggest that further
cutbacks could be forthcoming if orders do not rebound.
Turning to nonresidential construction, recent indicators
suggest that activity in this sector has continued to shrink.
Nonresidential construction put-in-place fell another 1.3 percent in
October, with further sharp declines for office and "other
commercial" buildings. Even though real outlays for office
construction dropped 25 percent over the year ended in the third
quarter, the vacancy rate for office buildings nationwide was still
19-1/2 percent at the end of September, indicating that the sector
remains badly overbuilt. Real outlays for "other commercial"
buildings, primarily stores and warehouses, declined more than
30 percent over the year ended in the third quarter; however, in
contrast to the office market, forward-looking indicators of other
commercial construction--such as newly signed contracts--suggest
that the steepest declines may be behind us. In the manufacturing

sector, the rate of capacity utilization continues to be relatively
low by historical standards and limits the need for new factory
construction. Overall, the outlook for total nonresidential
construction during the next several quarters remains bleak, with
the value of contracts signed for all nonresidential buildings still
on a sharp downtrend through October.
Business Inventories
After many months of decline, business inventories turned up
sharply in September, with sizable increases in both manufacturing
and retail trade. In manufacturing, the September increase in
stocks was followed by a month of virtually no change in October,
and serious overhangs of factory stocks are not apparent. However,
the buildup of retail stocks has gone on longer and has been more
pronounced than in manufacturing; the inventory-sales ratio moved up
in the retail sector in early autumn, perhaps into a range that is
undesirably high in light of the sluggishness of final sales.

much smaller increases in July and August. Rough staff estimates
indicate that something on the order of 40 percent of the
substantial pickup in the rate of retail inventory investment
resulted from increased supplies from overseas. Merchandise trade
data show that, in nominal terms, imports of consumer goods rose
sharply in September; the rise was especially large in apparel and
toys. As a result, foreign producers may bear much of any
subsequent adjustment.
In the auto sector, retail dealers' stocks of passenger cars at
the end of November amounted to about a 47-day supply relative to
the sluggish sales pace for that month. Although this ratio is well
below the 55- to 60-day standard once considered generally
acceptable by the industry, it is up a little from the very low
levels of early last summer. Given the uncertain outlook for sales,
the industry may have viewed even this small uptick in stocks as
cause for concern. Meanwhile, the inventories of foreign cars have
been backing up on dealers' lots; these stocks amounted to an 80-day
supply at the end of November. Inventories of light trucks also
have become burdensome of late, as sales have dropped off
considerably after the promotion-induced surge in September; this
rise in stocks no doubt was a factor in the assembly cutbacks
announced for light trucks in late November.
After a surge in September, manufacturers' inventories were
little changed in October. In the durable goods category, machinery
stocks continued to decline, while inventories held by motor vehicle
and aircraft industries expanded moderately. At nondurable goods
industries, a sharp drawdown in petroleum stocks was more than
offset by an accumulation of food, apparel, and paper products. The
manufacturers' inventory-to-shipments ratio continued its downtrend

in October; at the end of that month, the ratio was close to its
trough posted just before the onset of the 1990 recession.
Wholesale inventories were up slightly in October after a
sizable decline in September. Wholesale data at the industry level
showed a notable accumulation in stocks held by distributors of
apparel and miscellaneous durable goods. By contrast, stocks of
machinery fell for the third month in a row.
Housing Markets
After declining in September, housing starts and sales of new
and existing homes turned back up in October. However, November
surveys of the attitudes of builders and consumers suggest no
subsequent improvement, and the housing market remains remarkably
soft against the backdrop of the lowest mortgage rates in many
years.
In October, starts of single-family units more than recouped
their September decline. A comparable increase in the issuance of
building permits corroborates this pickup. Slightly more than half
of all single-family starts are nonspeculative or built-to-order, so
the increase in starts suggests some firming in demand. New
home sales rose 2 percent in October, and the September estimate was
revised upward to an unusual extent. While these sales data also
suggest some firming in demand, the volume of sales is still
quite low (chart, top panel, "Single Family Starts").
Construction of single-family housing has remained well below
the average of the 1980s, even though low interest rates and flat
house prices have made new homes more affordable on a cash-flow
basis than at any time since the mid-1970s (middle panel). However,
6. New homes built and sold by merchant builders--who sell both
the structure and the lot--typically account for about 60 percent of
all single-family activity. The remaining 40 percent of single-
family starts are units built-to-order on the buyer's land, either
by contractors or by the landowners themselves.

the recent weakness in house prices apparently has caused consumers
to reduce their expectations of capital gains from homeownership.
If consumers base their expectations of house price increases on the
recent past, they might in fact be perceiving the overall cost of
homeownership still to be relatively high. (Measures that factor in
such expectations are shown in the bottom panel of the chart.)
In the multifamily segment of the housing market, starts jumped
in October. But it is unlikely that this pickup signals the start
of a sustained recovery. Vacancy rates for multifamily rental
housing rose again in the third quarter, and real rents show no
signs of turning up. Until the low production of recent quarters
begins to tighten market supply appreciably, starts in this segment
of the market are likely to remain in the depressed range of 150,000
to 200,000 units per year.
Hard data on housing activity in November are not yet
available, and the various straws in the wind are providing mixed
signals. Based on a national sample of 400 builders interviewed
during the first half of November, the National Association of Home
Builders reported lower sales, but this decline appears to have been
largely seasonal (top panel, "Builders' Ratings"). By contrast, the
Home Builders' report of a falloff in expectations of sales six
months hence (middle panel) was a bit more than seasonal. Consumers
responding to the Michigan survey in November (bottom panel)
continued to be relatively positive about conditions for home
buying, but overall sentiment fell for the second month. Concerns
about employment and poor conditions for home selling may be keeping
trade-up home buyers out of the market.

quarters; however, federal receipts were revised down substantially.
For real purchases of goods and services, the revised figures still
show a sharp increase in defense spending during the Persian Gulf
war but a sizable decline since then. The recent quarterly pattern
of real nondefense expenditures was little changed by the revisions
and continues to show a moderate uptrend in recent quarters. The
downward adjustment in receipts was concentrated in personal taxes,
which were lowered substantially in each of the past five quarters;
as a result, receipts are now estimated to have risen only
1.8 percent since the second quarter of 1990, less than the rise in
nominal GDP. For fiscal year 1991, total federal receipts were
revised down $19 billion, federal expenditures were revised up
$1 billion, and the NIPA measure of the federal budget deficit was
revised up $20 billion to $190 billion.

In October, the federal government ran a unified budget deficit
of $36 billion, up about $5 billion from a year earlier. Over the
past three months, the deficit has totaled $86 billion, compared
with a $63 billion figure for the same three months in 1990. The
widening of the deficit reflects both relatively slow growth in
receipts, which were up only about 2 percent, and a rise in outlays
of nearly 9 percent. Year-over-year increases in outlays in recent
months have been concentrated in the categories of medicare and
health, social security, and income security. On the receipts side,

personal income tax collections have been running a little below
year-ago levels. For social insurance taxes, however, the expanded
medicare tax base legislated last year has led to relatively strong
year-over-year revenue growth recently.
The final days of the congressional session that ended
November 27 brought several new pieces of legislation: the extension
of unemployment benefits; financing of the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF)
and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC): extension of several
expiring tax breaks; and the appropriation of $5.8 billion in
emergency supplemental spending. The last of these pieces of
legislation has not yet been signed by the President.
The unemployment bill, as amended November 26, extends benefits
either thirteen weeks or twenty weeks depending on employment
conditions in the state of residence. Extended benefits are
available for workers who exhausted their regular benefits after
March 1, 1991, and the program is scheduled to continue until
June 13, 1992. The projected cost of the bill is $5.3 billion; in
keeping with existing budget rules, this spending was financed by
enacting measures that boost individual estimated taxes, by
permanently extending the law withholding tax refunds from taxpayers
in default on government loans, and by delaying for one year the
scheduled 1996 drop in the unemployment compensation tax.
The Congress authorized loans totaling approximately $70
billion for BIF. The fund will be able to borrow working capital
from the Federal Financing Bank of up to 90 percent of the estimated
market value of assets that the FDIC has and will acquire from
failed banks; these funds are expected to come to about $40 billion.
Another $30 billion is a direct loan from the Treasury that is to be
repaid over fifteen years out of deposit insurance premiums.
Separate legislation appropriated $25 billion of the RTC's

II-28
$80 billion request, an amount projected to satisfy needs through
April 1, 1992.
The Congress extended, for six months, twelve popular tax
breaks that were set to expire in January, most notably the research
and experimentation tax credit and the low-income housing tax
credit. The revenue loss, about $3 billion over five years, was made
up by enacting measures to accelerate corporate tax payments.
Twelve of the thirteen regular appropriations bills for fiscal
1992 are complete. Foreign operations, for which an appropriations
bill has not yet been passed, are being funded under a continuing
resolution. The $5.8 billion emergency supplemental appropriation
includes $4 billion to replenish stocks used during Operation Desert
Storm, $995 million for agriculture disaster assistance, and $800
million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency; these
appropriations will be spent over several years and, because of the
"emergency" designation, are not subject to the spending caps set in
last year's budget agreement.
State and Local Government Sector
The comprehensive NIPA revision did not alter the recent
pattern of state and local spending very much. Purchases of goods
and services are now estimated to have declined at a 0.5 percent
annual rate in the third quarter, after falling at a 1-1/4 percent
annual rate in the first half. The slowing this year follows back-
to-back increases of more than 3-1/2 percent in 1989 and 1990 and
has encompassed all major types of purchases.
State and local employment rose slightly, on net, in October
and November. However, these data are volatile and frequently have
been revised substantially. When viewed over a slightly longer time
period, employment has fallen, on balance, since midyear, after only
small monthly increases, on average, in the first half. By

II-30
contrast, job gains in 1989 and 1990 averaged about 35,000 per
month.
The slowing in spending this year, along with record tax hikes,
has contributed to an improvement in the sector's fiscal position.
Indeed, on an NIPA basis, the deficit of operating and capital
accounts for all state and local governments, excluding social
insurance funds, fell to $33 billion in the third quarter, about
$14 billion below the peak reported in the fourth quarter of 1990.
Nonetheless, about half the states have reported revenue shortfalls
and spending overruns for the current fiscal year, setting the stage
for another round of budget-balancing measures, and, thus, greater
fiscal restraint. In California, the governor's office projects a
fiscal 1992 budget gap of around $4 billion, with the size of the
prospective deficit having mounted since mid-year. In New York, the
governor has announced a prospective shortfall of about $900
million.
Not surprisingly, the fiscal imbalances of state and local
governments have been most severe in those regions that have
suffered the largest employment losses over the past year. The
largest declines in payrolls, in percentage terms, were in New York,
New Jersey, and the New England states, with smaller reductions
elsewhere in the mid-Atlantic region and the South. Payroll
employment also has fallen in California. By contrast, employment
has grown in more than half the states, with a scattering of
midwestern states experiencing relatively rapid growth in jobs
(map).
Wage Developments
The incoming data on labor costs suggest that the rate of
increase in wages is on a downtrend. Over the past twelve months
the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers

II-31
have risen 3.0 percent; they had increased 3.6 percent in the
previous 12-month period. The rate of increase since June has been
less than 2 percent at an annual rate.

1. Changes over periods longer than one month are measured from final
month of preceding period to final month of period indicated.
Other than slack in the labor market, probably the most
important determinant of labor costs is actual and expected
inflation. One forward-looking indicator of inflation is provided
by the Michigan survey of consumers. According to this survey, the
mean expected price change over a twelve-month forecasting horizon
has come down substantially from the late 1990 highs that followed
the oil shock. But in the past two months, the mean expected price
change has moved back up somewhat (chart).
More light can be shed on the meaning of these findings by
examining not just the mean expected price increase but the full
distribution of responses (table). This distribution is extremely
diffuse, spanning a wide and nonsymmetric range of possible
outcomes. The standard deviation in the recent past has been at
least 5 percentage points; in addition, more than 20 percent of the
respondents expect prices to remain flat or to fall over the next
twelve months, and more than 10 percent of the respondents expect
inflation of 10 percent or higher. The sharp drop in the mean last
summer and the more recent rebound can be traced to a swing in the

proportion of respondents who think inflation will be unusually
high--15 percent or more. By contrast, the median, which is less
sensitive to extreme observations, has shown a gradual and fairly
steady downward drift recently. The November readings for both the
mean and the median were toward the low end of the ranges of the
past several years (chart).
Prices
Like inflation expectations, the actual rate of price increase
appears to be trending gradually lower, although the monthly
patterns of change have been somewhat erratic in both the CPI and
PPI. In October, the consumer price index rose only 0.1 percent,
after an increase of 0.4 percent in September. Food prices edged
down in October, energy prices were up only slightly, and the rise
for items other than food and energy was unusually small--just 0.1
percent. At the producer level, the prices of finished goods rose
0.7 percent in October, but this jump followed four months of small
advances or declines. Large price increases for energy and motor
vehicles accounted for much of the October rise.
Monthly changes in the CPI for food this year have largely
reflected short-run volatility in the prices of fresh fruits and
vegetables, superimposed on a very moderate trend rate of increase
in the prices of other foods (chart). That pattern continued in
October, when widespread price declines were reported for fresh
fruits and vegetables; prices of fresh oranges dropped back
especially sharply and began to retrace the climb that followed the
freeze in California last winter. Meat prices also were down
7. The October PPI also included some sharp increases in
prescription drugs, soaps, and detergents that reflected the end of
temporary discounts; these discounts had helped to hold prices down
in the September report. Moreover, according to the BLS, the
October rise in consumer durable goods may have been overstated
because of problems with seasonal adjustment.

somewhat further in October, while prices of other foods again rose
moderately, on average, although a bit more than in September.
Some upward pressures on retail food prices may emerge in the
next few months. Prices of some fresh vegetables, notably lettuce,
have been boosted recently by an infestation of whiteflies in the
desert areas of California and Arizona; these areas normally supply
a large share of the nation's fresh produce from November to
February. In addition, the effects of recent increases in farm
prices of milk and wheat probably have not yet been fully seen at
retail. However, with average farm prices well below the levels of
a year ago, livestock producers apparently locked into expansion,
and futures prices subdued, the odds of a sustained runup in food
prices seem small.
Energy prices rose 0.2 percent in the October CPI as declines
for gasoline offset most of the increases in other components.
Private survey data point to sizable increases in retail gasoline
prices in November, and retail prices of fuel oil also are likely to
move up, reflecting the passthrough of earlier increases in crude
oil costs. However, these upward pressures should be short-lived;
prices of crude oil have retreated markedly since October and by
early December had more than reversed their runup of early autumn.
The October rise of 0.1 percent in the CPI excluding food and
energy followed a four-month stretch in which the monthly increases
in this indicator of core inflation had held stubbornly at 0.4
percent. Goods prices edged down, on average, in October, with
8. A huge runup in lettuce prices in the first half of November
was partially reversed later in the month. According to some
trade reports, the initial price runup may have been caused in part
by panic buying in the wake of sensational media stories. Growers
anticipate that supplies of produce will continue to be available
from the desert areas this winter, albeit in smaller amounts than in
the absence of the whitefly. As of early December, the wholesale
prices of the vegetables were in a normal range overall but up
sharply from the very low levels of October.

declines in several categories. Apparel prices retreated for the
second month, on a seasonally adjusted basis, after large increases
in July and August that had reflected the early introduction of fall
and winter apparel. Prices of new motor vehicles also registered
seasonally adjusted declines. In addition, the CPI for nonenergy
services rose a moderate 0.3 percent in October, held down in part
by large declines in airfares and auto financing costs. Moreover,
rent increases slowed after picking up in September.
The October CPI probably overstates the slowing in the core
inflation rate, and increases in the next few months may not be as
small. For example, the declines for apparel in part reflected
problems with seasonal adjustment. In addition, the October PPI
showed the prices of cars and light trucks moving up markedly
further, to levels about 4-1/2 percent and 5-1/2 percent,
respectively, above those a year earlier. In the absence of a
marked enhancement of incentive programs, these increases at the
manufacturers' level point to sizable advances in the CPI for new
vehicles in coming months. While there have been widespread
reports of early discounting for a variety of other consumer goods,
it is impossible to know at this point if the actual degree of
discounting this year has been any greater than usual.
In the markets for industrial materials, upward price pressures
have not been apparent of late. The PPI for intermediate materials
(nonfood, nonenergy) was little changed in October for the fifth
consecutive month, and the level of this index was somewhat below
that of a year earlier. Prices of crude nonfood materials less
energy were down 0.5 percent in October, reflecting large declines
9. In the CPI, new-model cars and trucks are phased into the
sample over several months, starting in October, as they replace
previous models on the dealers' lots. By contrast, the new-model
vehicles enter the PPI sample--which reflects manufacturers'
prices--in October and remain through the following September.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Treasury bill rates have dropped more than 50 basis points
since the November FOMC meeting, in association with actual and
anticipated policyeasings. The federal funds rate fell 1/4 point
in early November in connection with a 1/2 point cut in the discount
rate, and another 1/4 point in early December. Most private money
market rates have declined by similar amounts, but concerns about
securing funding over year-end have muted the decline in one-month
rates, as maturity dates moved across the end of the year. Treasury
bond rates have fallen about 25 basis points over the intermeeting
period, resulting in a further steepening of the yield curve.
Shortly after the cut in the discount rate, the prime rate was
reduced 1/2 percentage point, to 7-1/2 percent, yet the spread
between the prime rate and bank funding costs remains quite large.
Broad stock price indexes are down 3 to 5 percent over the
intermeeting period. Negative news on the recovery weighed on the
market, and a Senate vote to cap interest rates on credit cards
precipitated a 120-point drop in the Dow on November 15. Bank
stocks have been hit hard, with money center equity prices falling
by about 11 percent since the last FOMC meeting.
M2 and M3, boosted by strength in their most liquid components,
accelerated slightly in November, but remained close to the bottom
of their target ranges. Meanwhile, M1 continued to expand briskly.
Bank credit grew moderately again in November, as loans posted their
first increase since June.
Overall borrowing by nonfinancial firms picked up slightly in
November but was not robust. Gross bond issuance was strong, as
firms took advantage of receptive markets to lengthen debt maturity
and retire high-coupon issues. Despite the setback in the stock
market, equity issuance set a record. Commercial paper expanded for

the first time since July, but bank business loans ran off.
Installment borrowing by consumers remained sluggish through October
as household spending on durables was weak, and data from commercial
banks for November point to another slack month. Available data
suggest some rebound in mortgage borrowing thus far in the fourth
quarter.
Fourth-quarter borrowing by the federal government, though down
on a not seasonally adjusted basis from the third quarter's torrid
pace, is expected to remain heavy. Now that the Congress has
authorized funds for the RTC and FDIC, auction sizes should increase
around year-end. Borrowing by state and local governments
accelerated in November, reflecting a step-up in bond issuance for
both new capital and refunding and efforts to cope with budget
deficits.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 grew at a 4 percent annual rate in November, and M3 at a 3
percent pace, each about a percentage point above their October
growth rates. The uptick in M2 growth came from its liquid deposit
components, reflecting the further narrowing of opportunity costs
that has accompanied policy easings. A 14 percent rate of expansion
of M1 in November was sustained by accelerations in demand deposits
and OCDs, while currency growth slowed because of decreased
shipments abroad. Anecdotal evidence suggests that inflows to stock
and bond mutual funds, which were very heavy through October, may
not have abated in November, despite the break in stock market
prices. Outflows from small time deposits and M2-type money market
mutual funds stayed heavy last month. M3 growth benefited from a
resumption of large CD issuance at branches and agencies of foreign

banks and continued strong inflows to institution-only money market
mutual funds. 1
Bank credit grew at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in November,
with loan growth turning positive after several months of declines.
Real estate loans advanced moderately for a second month, as runoffs
at large domestic banks slowed. Despite an estimated 2-1/2
percentage point boost from rebookings of off-shore loans by foreign
branches and agencies, business loans resumed their decline in
November, with large domestic banks leading the way. Business loans
at small banks dropped at a 10 percent annual rate, in line with the
rapid declines seen recently. Over the past two quarters, C&I loans
have contracted more rapidly at small than at large banks. November
data from the Survey of the Terms of Bank Lending show that, since
early this year, loan rates at small banks have softened relative to
those at very large banks, suggesting that the unusual weakness at
smaller banks owes importantly to slack demand. The weakness in
business loans likely also reflected repayments of bank debt from
the proceeds of reverse LBOs and other equity offerings. Total loan
growth comprised strong advances in two volatile components,
security loans and other loans. In view of the up-and-down nature
of these series, the turnaround of bank lending in November may
prove to be short-lived.
Acquisitions of U.S. government securities slowed in November,
but again accounted for most of the growth in bank credit. At large
banks, holdings of mortgage pass-throughs declined slightly on the
month, continuing a pattern of runoffs in this instrument seen since
spring. Data from bank call reports through September (table) show
that acquisitions of pass-throughs stalled, on balance, over the
second and third quarters. The stagnation in pass-throughs stemmed

acquisitions of U.S. government securities, as banks seem to have
bypassed pass-throughs for CMOs. Pass-throughs give the holder a
share in a pool of mortgages whose average life may be quite long,
but CMOs can offer banks the flexibility to add to their securities
portfolio at particular maturities, while also offering a yield
advantage over comparable Treasuries. According to the October 1991
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, the average maturity of CMO
tranches held by domestic respondent banks was about three years.
Chargeoffs net of recoveries rose for all three major

continued to level out after rising markedly in 1990 and early this
year.
Business Finance
The decline in business loans at banks in November was about
matched by the first increase in nonfinancial commercial paper since
July. Issuance of paper may have been boosted by firms selling
paper with maturities in 1992 to avoid potential problems with the
availability of funds at year-end. Indeed, the average maturity of
outstanding commercial paper increased to an extremely high 43-1/2
days.
Underlying demands for financing, though, continued to be
directed at the capital markets, as firms took advantage of low
long-term rates and attractive share prices. Gross public bond
issuance by nonfinancial corporations rose from $9 billion in
October to $10.5 billion in November, and issuance so far in
December also has been strong. Despite the strong issuance, spreads
of investment-grade issues over Treasuries narrowed somewhat and may
have benefited from increased demand from life insurance companies.
Junk bond issuance about doubled in October and again in November,
as stronger speculative-grade firms took advantage of lower yields
to refinance more costly debt. The drop in rates probably reflected
recent paydowns of junk bonds with the proceeds of equity issues, as
well as strong demand from junk bond mutual funds, which have
experienced significant inflows so far this year.
Nonfinancial corporations issued equity at a record pace in
November despite a midmonth drop in stock prices, and issuance in
December continues at a rapid pace. Several large issues have
accounted for most of the volume of new equity. For example, early
in November, Ford Motor Company raised badly needed new capital with
a $2.2 billion offering of convertible preferred stock, the size of

III-10
which was increased threefold because of strong investor demand. In
the first week of December, General Motors completed a sale of $1
billion in preferred stock. Some firms took advantage of generally
high stock prices to deleverage, even after the mid-November market
decline. Moreover, the calendar of new issues remains full,
although several scheduled IPOs have been withdrawn or postponed in
the wake of increased price volatility.
Evidence of problems at major life insurance companies
continued to emerge in the intermeeting period. Aetna announced its
expectation that $740 million of its real estate loans will become
delinquent in 1992 and another $530 million will require
restructuring. In the first such move in decades, Metropolitan Life
cut its dividend to policyholders. The 8 percent cut was attributed
to reduced earnings stemming from lower interest rates and losses on
real estate loans.
Insurance companies, with varying success, have tried to
enhance liquidity and raise the average credit quality of their
assets. An attempt by Mutual of New York to reduce reliance on
guaranteed investment contract liabilities with pension funds, a
highly volatile source of funds, was mostly unsuccessful. MONY
offered its pension fund customers an opportunity to transfer these
contracts to Metropolitan Life, but the pension funds balked at
Metropolitan Life's harsh terms. Acquisitions of junk debt in the
private placement market have been reduced, and firms have sought
ways to remove troubled credits from their balance sheets.
Connecticut General securitized $400 million of its junk bond
portfolio but, by retaining the residual piece of $70 million, seems
to have kept most of the risk. In contrast, market sources reported
that Equitable located a buyer for the residual portion of a planned
securitization of some of its junk bond portfolio. Prudential

III-11
securitized, and placed privately, about $350 million of commercial
real estate loans.
Treasury and Sponsored-Agency Financing
The staff anticipates a fourth-quarter federal deficit of $105
billion, up about $14 billion from the third quarter. Despite the
increase in the deficit, the amount of marketable borrowing should
be about $23 billion below that in the third quarter because of
increased drawdowns of the cash balance and swings in nonmarketable
borrowing and other means of finance. This quarter's reduced
marketable borrowing, which is viewed by the Treasury as temporary,
so far has occurred mainly in the bill sector, where the Treasury
typically meets transitory fluctuations in borrowing needs. With
legislative authority for renewed RTC and FDIC spending now in
place, the staff expects substantial increases in both bill and
coupon auction sizes beginning around year-end. 2
In an effort to expand participation in auctions of its
securities, the Treasury announced several rule changes in late
October. These changes allowed all registered government securities
brokers and dealers--not just primary dealers--to bid on behalf of
customers. They also permitted anyone to bid without making a
deposit at a Federal Reserve Bank, provided payment was adequately
assured, and they increased from $1 million to $5 million the
maximum award to any single noncompetitive bidder in note and bond
auctions. It is too early to determine whether these changes will
reduce Treasury borrowing costs. There is some reason for optimism,
2. Legislation passed on November 26, 1991, provided to the RTC
another $25 billion, which must be spent by April 1992. The bill
reorganized RTC by strengthening the role of the chief executive
officer and replacing the current Oversight Board and Board of
Directors with one board that will review policies rather than set
them. Other legislation shored up the FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund by
extending its line of credit with the Treasury from $5 billion to
$30 billion and by providing for additional working-capital
borrowing by FDIC.

None of the bills that would stiffen the regulation of

Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term municipal securities surged to more
than $15 billion in November, the highest monthly pace in five
years. There were strong increases in offerings for both new
capital and refundings. Despite a slight increase in rates on long-
term municipals, yields remained low enough to make cost effective
the refunding of some of the bonds issued in 1985, the market's
heaviest year of issuance. Some refundings, however, reflected
budgetary distress and were motivated by a desire to reduce current
debt service costs by extending the maturity of debt.

take advantage of low yields to replace debt backed by credit
enhancement with unenhanced debt.3 Because of investor
nervousness about the close links between state and city budgets,
the announcement by the state led the city to postpone its bond sale
by a day and may have cost the city 10 basis points on the long end
of the serial issue.
The impact of California's lingering recession on state
finances is a continuing concern for municipal market participants.
Because of persistent revenue shortfalls, Standard & Poor's has
warned that maintenance of California's triple-A rating will depend
on swift adoption of budget-balancing measures.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the tax-exempt status of
two classes of municipal bonds--single-family mortgage revenue bonds
and small-scale industrial development bonds--starting at year-end
1987. Every year since then, the Congress has approved one-year
extensions of tax-exempt status. Although market participants had
thought prospects for another extension were slim, the Congress
recently approved one for six months. Prior to the extension,
however, there was no surge in offerings, partly because many
entities had issued large volumes last year as the previous deadline
approached, and partly because many states had reached the limits
placed on private activity bond issuance by the 1986 tax reform act.
Mortgage Markets
Over the intermeeting period, contract rates on thirty-year,
conventional, fixed-rate mortgages declined about fifteen basis
points to their lowest levels since early 1977. Initial rates on
adjustable-rate mortgages are at their lowest levels since the
series was started in January 1984. The Mortgage Bankers

III-16
Association's weekly survey indicates that applications for
refinancing have nearly quadrupled since midsummer (chart).
Applications for home purchase loans also have been rising, but at a
much slower pace. Industry sources suggest that refinancings now
account for more than half of all mortgage loan applications.
Prepayment rates on some outstanding mortgages rose sharply in
October and November, and the current surge in refinancing
applications suggests that prepayment rates will increase further in
coming months. As a result, yield spreads on mortgage-backed
securities, particularly those with premium coupons of 9.5 to 10.5
percent, have widened since the November FOMC meeting. The
mortgages underlying these premium securities have interest rates of
about 10 to 11.25 percent and are prime candidates for refinancing
at current market rates.
Prepayment rates on conventional mortgages are likely to surge
more than those on FHA mortgages because recent increases in
mortgage insurance premiums and tighter downpayment requirements
have raised the cost of refinancing an existing FHA mortgage with
another FHA mortgage. Despite a relatively slow housing market,
industry sources expect by year-end that the combination of faster
prepayment rates, consumer preferences for fixed-rate loans, and
larger loan origination shares for mortgage bankers will have
resulted in the issuance of more than $260 billion in fixed-rate
agency pass-throughs in 1991, surpassing the previous annual record
of $255 billion in 1986.
In other developments, delinquency rates for home mortgages in
the third quarter were mixed. According to the Mortgage Bankers
Association, which measures the number of delinquent loans rather
than the dollar amounts, the thirty-day "all loan" delinquency rate
declined 0.21 percentage point in the third quarter to 5.07 percent,

III-17
partly retracing the previous quarter's rise. However, the rate for
single-family loans sixty days or more past due, a measure of more
serious payment problems, edged up .03 percentage point to 1.67
percent, owing to increases in delinquency rates for FHA-insured and
VA-guaranteed loans. Although this latest uptick marked the third
consecutive quarterly increase, the sixty-day measure remains well
below the average experience of 1985-86, when levels above 1.90
percent were common.
Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit edged up in October, increasing at
an annual rate of 1-1/4 percent. September growth was revised
upward to virtually no change from an initially reported decline of
2-1/2 percent. Auto credit declined less than originally estimated
in September and was down only slightly in October. However, total
installment debt and its auto component were still weak. Revolving
credit remained the only component exhibiting positive growth.
Installment debt outstanding peaked in November 1990 at $736.4
billion, then dropped about $6.5 billion through October, for an
annual rate of decline of about 1 percent. Although it is too early
to tell whether August represents the bottom in consumer credit, the
nine-month period of decline to that point would still be the
longest contraction since World War II, although credit contractions
in 1958, 1974-75, and 1980 were larger in percentage terms.
Home equity lines of credit (categorized as mortgage rather
than consumer debt) and automobile leasing may have shaved a
percentage point off the growth rate of consumer installment debt
since early last year, but the drop over this period is attributable
mainly to weak consumer spending, particularly for automobiles and
other durables often financed with installment debt. On the whole,

the pattern of consumer borrowing over the most recent business
cycle is roughly in line with the experience of past cycles.
Trends in consumer loan delinquency rates also have mirrored
historical patterns over the past several quarters. After bottoming
out early in the economic expansion of the 1980s and rising steadily
during the rest of the period, delinquency rates in the most recent
recession reached approximately the same peak levels recorded during
the previous two recessions. Data from the American Bankers
Association on the number of delinquent loans in the third quarter
were mixed, with the average delinquency rate on closed-end consumer
loans rising a bit but the credit card delinquency rate unchanged.
Delinquencies at auto finance companies dropped slightly.
Experience indicates that consumer loan delinquencies drop sharply
from their peaks near the beginning of a recovery. By that point,
writeoffs of bad loans and a cautious approach to new lending have
stopped the rise in delinquencies, and a turnaround in debt growth,
as the economy picks up, reduces the delinquency ratio.
Bank willingness to make consumer loans, according to the
October Senior Loan Officer Survey, has increased a bit, and
consumer interest rates at banks, with the exception of credit card
rates, have declined noticeably (table). Rates on 48-month new-car
loans declined 1/2 percentage point between'the August and November
surveys. These rates are down nearly 2 percentage points from their
peak in the second quarter of 1989 (chart). Although these declines
are less than the declines in yields on Treasury securities of
comparable maturity, they are generally in line with changes in
three-year bank retail CD rates, a rough measure of marginal funding
costs for car loans.
The failure of credit card interest rates to retreat in recent
quarters led the Senate to pass, on November 14, a federal ceiling

on these rates. After the Senate vote, issuance of asset-backed
securities slowed considerably. Spreads initially jumped 20 to 40
basis points, as investors feared the prepayment consequences of a
cap on rates. The cap did not become law, and spreads then
narrowed, but they remain 5 to 10 basis points higher than before
the vote. Rates on two large credit card issues sold by Citicorp
at the end of October were raised about 5 basis points before
settlement in mid-November. Spreads on securities backed by assets
other than credit cards were little changed. Although the
likelihood of a rate ceiling becoming law has faded, only one asset-
backed issue, backed by home equity loans, has been placed since the
bill's passage.
The recent rigidity of credit card rates continues a pattern
that has persisted since the development of general-purpose credit
cards in the mid-1960s. The aggregate data mask the variety of
interest rates offered to consumers. They reflect only the "most
common" rate charged, which, when multiple rates are offered, is
usually the highest rate. In the Board's latest semiannual report
on credit card terms at selected institutions, 11 percent of
respondents had rates below 16 percent as of July 31. Another 5
percent offered plans with a tiered rate structure, assessing lower
rates on higher balance levels. It also has'become more common for
issuers to offer several plans, with lower rates made available to
more creditworthy customers. On the other hand, many large national
issuers have been aggressive marketers, lowering credit standards
for their regular cards and keeping interest rates high to
compensate for higher credit risk.
The relative stability of credit card rates probably reflects
interest-inelastic demand for credit card services, giving lenders
little incentive to reduce rates to most cardholders. Reductions of

III-22
1 or 2 percentage points would stimulate little incremental usage by
existing customers and would not attract enough new customers to
offset the decline in interest income from lowering rates for all
cardholders. Competition among issuers has instead focused on
product differentiation through advertising, product enhancements
(auto rental insurance, buyer protection plans, rebates), and
reduction or waivers of annual fees.

APPENDIX
GROWTH OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN 1991
M2 and M3 expanded unusually slowly in 1991, while M1 grew
briskly, according more closely with historical relationships with
income and interest rates. During the first half of the year, the
impetus to money growth from declining opportunity costs and the
nascent economic recovery produced a modest acceleration in M2 and
M3, placing them about at the midpoints of their annual target
ranges. In the third quarter, though, M2 posted its first quarterly
decline in the postwar period and its velocity increased markedly.
M2 growth resumed in October and November--just enough to return its
level to the 2-1/2 percent lower bound of its annual target range.
Several factors appear to have been important in slowing M2's
advance this year. Perhaps most prominent has been the sluggish
growth of nominal income and spending. However, the expansion of M2
fell well short of what would be expected based on historical
relationships with income and opportunity costs; velocity was little
changed over the year despite substantial declines in interest
rates. Bond and stock mutual funds became an attractive alternative
to retail CDs and M2 money funds as the yield curve steepened; net
inflows to bond funds were especially brisk throughout the year.
The wide gap between consumer credit rates and rates on M2 deposits,
along with heavy repayment burdens, may have encouraged households
to pay down debt by drawing on M2 balances. Finally, the abrogation
of time deposit contracts and the general disruption in customer
relationships attending RTC resolutions may have encouraged some
depositors to shift from M2 to non-M2 financial assets.
The restructuring in the thrift industry and banks' efforts to
restrain balance sheet growth were doubtless major factors behind
M3's sharp decline in the third quarter and modest growth for the
year. Since September, M3 has fluctuated around the 1 percent lower
bound of its annual target range, with a little strengthening
evident in the most recent data. The meager pace of M3 growth in
1991 was consistent with picture from the asset side of depository
balance sheets--bank credit through November has edged up only 3
percent while thrift credit through August continued to contract.
Although varying substantially from month to month, M1 this year has
expanded at an 8 percent rate through November; with rates on M1
assets adjusting only sluggishly, or constrained by law, the decline
in M1 opportunity costs was especially sharp.
Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt averaged only 5
percent from the fourth quarter of last year through October,
despite 11-1/2 percent growth in its federal debt component over the
same interval. Nonfederal debt grew at only a 3 percent annual rate
through October, its slowest pace in three decades, with business
loans at banks and consumer credit registering substantial declines.
Also holding business borrowing at bay was a sharp cutback in merger
and LBO activity; indeed equity issuance turned positive after seven
years of large net share retirements as many firms sought to
deleverage their balance sheets. Households also appeared to
"deleverage" during the course of the year, reining in spending,
especially on durables, and trimming debt burdens. Mortgage debt
growth slowed in 1991, owing primarily to the depressed market in
commercial real estate. State and local governments issued debt at
the fastest rate since 1985 with a large portion of new issues going

to refinance existing debt; state and local debt outstanding has
grown only about 4 percent at an annual rate through October.
M1
M1 growth in 1991 has exceeded the pace of recent years. Early
in the year, M1 was boosted by rapid growth in currency, spurred by
safe-haven demands for U.S. currency amid the tensions in the
Persian Gulf. Fueled by strong foreign shipments, currency growth
in the first quarter topped 15 percent, at an annual rate, and was a
substantial element in overall M1 growth. After the Gulf war,
foreign demands for U.S. currency waned and currency growth in the
second quarter slipped to about 4 percent.
Despite the deceleration in currency during the second quarter,
M1 growth picked up as both demand deposits and other checkable
deposits (OCD) began to respond to the substantial decline in
opportunity costs since year-end 1990. Following their typical
pattern, offering rates on OCD accounts responded very sluggishly to
the steep decline in market rates in the first six months of 1991.
The consequent narrowing in opportunity costs made OCD accounts more
attractive relative to small time deposits and short-dated market
instruments; through November, OCD growth has average 12-1/2
percent.
The decline in market rates brought new life to demand deposits
as well. Demand deposits had been on a downtrend since 1987,
apparently reflecting a secular decline in compensating balances as
many businesses and banks opted for direct fee arrangements instead.
This year, demand deposit growth through November has averaged 8
percent, although its path during the year has been quite erratic.
Demand deposits decelerated in the third quarter but surged in
October and November with monthly growth rates of 14 and 20 percent,
respectively. In part, this renewed strength likely reflects
increases in compensating balances occasioned by lower market rates.
In part, it probably also reflect a pickup in mortgage refinancings;
in some instances, mortgage prepayments are held temporarily as
demand accounts by mortgage servicers. In addition, demand deposit
growth in October was boosted by a change in accounting practice at
Security Pacific's trust company subsidiary in New York, which
produced a downward shift in CIPC and an upward level shift in its
demand deposits.
M2
In the first half of 1991. M2 accelerated from its lackluster
growth pace in 1990. Narrowing opportunity costs generated
substantial inflows to liquid retail deposits that outweighed
runoffs in small time deposits. Stronger M1 growth and the pickup
in the nontransactions components of M2 combined to push the June
level of M2 near the middle of its annual target range. Although M2
growth at that point in the year had been a bit weaker than
predicted by the staff's standard M2 model, it was broadly
consistent with the configuration of opportunity costs and various
indicators of economic activity. M2 began to lose its momentum in
June, however, presaging an unprecedented decline in the third
quarter. The decline coincided with modest growth in nominal income
and continued narrowing in opportunity costs. M2 velocity in the
third quarter increased 4-3/4 percent at an annual rate--nearly 6
percentage points more than predicted by the standard M2 model--and

III-A-4
the level of M2 by September had fallen just below the lower bound
of its target range.
Moderate M2 growth resumed in the fourth quarter, at a 3
percent pace in October and close to 4 percent in November. Much of
the turnaround reflected the continued strength in liquid components
--OCD, savings and MMDAs--and a slower rate of decline in M2 money
funds. Part of the increase also reflected a jump in overnight
Eurodollars to a November level that was about $5 billion higher
than the third-quarter average.
The primary factors slowing M2's advance this year, other than
weak income growth, were taking shape near the end of the second
quarter. Short-term market rates had been declining for several
months while rates on longer-term securities had declined only
modestly. M2 money funds, which earlier had boosted M2, began to
decelerate after the uncertainties in the Persian Gulf had been
resolved. By June, money fund investors were finding their returns
far less attractive relative to other market instruments. Yields on
bank and thrift retail CDs also fell sharply during the first half
of the year and small time deposits began running off swiftly toward
the end of the second quarter. In part, this reflected the usual
compositional shift between liquid and small time deposits that
occurs when market rates fall. However, by June, the declines in
small time deposits more than offset inflows to liquid components
such as savings and MMDAs. In the third quarter, money fund and
retail CD holders seemed to be "reaching for yield" by extending the
maturity of their portfolios. Bond and stock funds were major
beneficiaries in this process. In fact, inflows to bond funds have
been brisk throughout 1991 and have proceeded at a near-record pace
since mid-year. Major bond funds actively pursued retail CD
"rollover" money, running full page ads in major newspapers
comparing their recent rates of return with those available on
retail CDs.
In addition to portfolio shifts, it appears that household
deleveraging and depository consolidation were also a drag on M2
growth this year. Low returns available on M2 assets juxtaposed
with the high interest rates on consumer credit--especially
considering the lack of federal tax deductibility--likely encouraged
some households to draw down M2 balances. Indeed, consumer credit
has been on a downtrend throughout most of 1991.
Finally, the rapid pace of RTC resolutions likely depressed M2
and M3 growth in the third quarter and throughout the year.
Statistical evidence suggests that M2 growth may be relatively weak
during quarters in which the RTC resolves a large number of thrifts.
This phenomenon apparently occurs as depositor relationships are
disrupted, most notably when acquiring institutions abrogate the
small time deposit contracts of failed thrifts. Non-RTC mergers of
depositories, including both federally assisted and non-assisted
mergers, also appear to have contributed to runoffs of small time
deposits this year.
M3
Weak loan demand together with the effects of capital
constraints, the consolidation of the thrift industry, and a general
rechannelling of credit flows away from financial intermediaries
severely limited the scope for expansion in bank and thrift balance
sheets during 1991. Early in the year, though, M3 displayed

III-A-5
surprising strength, In part, this reflected the pickup in M2
growth showing through to the broader aggregate. In addition, M3
money funds grew rapidly in the first quarter, as nervous investors
searched for a safe harbor prior to the Gulf war. However, the most
important single factor contributing to early robust growth in M3
was the resurgence of the Yankee CD market sparked by the change in
reserve requirements late in 1990. After the Board cut reserve
requirements on nonpersonal time deposits and net Eurocurrency
liabilities to zero, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks
showed a distinct preference for funding with domestically issued
CDs versus borrowing from their head office or in the federal funds
market. Between December of 1990 and March of 1991, branches and
agencies issued nearly $40 billion in Yankee CDs.
Domestic banks and thrifts shed large time deposits at a rapid
rate throughout the year. In part, depositories were responding to
core deposit inflows by paring more expensive managed liabilities
such as wholesale CDs. The RTC also played a large role by, in
effect, financing the assets it took on its books with Treasury
securities rather than large time deposits.
Even apart from these forces, large time deposits were under
pressure from the trend in financial flows away from intermediaries.
The retrenchment in consumer debt and business reliance on corporate
bond and equity issues to finance weak investment spending were
likely major factors contributing to the 1/2 percent contraction in
bank loans through November of this year. Supply effects also were
important, as tighter capital requirements, higher deposit insurance
premiums, and the increased risk in lending perceived by
depositories and their examiners resulted in wider intermediary
spreads and limited expansion in depository balance sheets.
Domestic Nonfinancial Sector Debt
Overall domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have grown
only 5 percent in 1991, marking the slowest advance in three decades
and placing the level of nonfinancial debt near the bottom of its
monitoring range. Private sector debt growth slowed as both
households and business acted to trim debt burdens. In contrast,
federal debt has grown at a double-digit rate this year as the
recession took its toll on government receipts and boosted some
outlays. Spending associated with deposit insurance programs added
about 2 percentage points to the rise in federal debt this year and
one-half percentage point to total debt growth.
In the household sector, the low level of new home building and
home sales cut mortgage debt growth to less than 7 percent--well
below the pace of recent years. Much new home mortgage credit took
the form of fixed-rate mortgages as homebuyers responded to the
decline in mortgage rates to their lowest levels in nearly 15 years.
Consumer debt declined fairly steadily until the fall; much of the
weakness owed to a downturn in auto credit, consistent with sagging
auto sales and car buyers' growing preference for leasing
arrangements rather than ownership. In addition, households
continued to substitute home equity loans for installment debt and
other consumer credit.
Growth in business debt was especially weak this year. Many
businesses moved to improve their balance sheet--shrinking
commercial paper and bank loans, issuing equity, and relying on
internal funds to finance outlays. The turnaround in equity

III-A-6
financing has been especially striking; net issuance for the year
turned positive for the first time in seven years. Despite the
overall downturn in the growth of business debt, corporate bond
issuance surged throughout the year in response to lower rates.
Bond funds, flush with new money from investors dissatisfied with
returns on bank retail CDs, absorbed much of the increase in
corporate bond issues this year.
Budget pressure on state and local governments intensified
during the year and, although some units financed current deficits
by borrowing, net debt growth in this sector remained weak. Gross
issuance of bonds was substantial over the year, but a sizable
portion went to replace retiring debt or to refund existing debt at
lower rates. Spreads on tax-exempt issues generally have been
narrow this year despite several downgradings and the well-
publicized financial woes of some local governments.

in the first quarter as Big Three producers began shipping for the
new model year. The increase in automotive imports from Japan
partially reversed the sharp decline recorded in the second quarter
and reflected, in part, increased shipments of luxury cars. Imports
of computers continued to climb in the third quarter, reaching a new
high. Aside from computers, imports of machinery declined for the
third consecutive quarter.
The recent rise in imports appears to have been associated with
a large buildup in retail inventories, most notably in September.
Data on industrial production, retail inventories, and imports
suggest that more than three fourths of the increase in inventories
of apparel and miscellaneous non-durable goods (which include toys)
in September was imported goods. To the extent that these
inventories might now be viewed by retailers as excessive (given the
recent slowdown in economic activity), any inventory correction in
these categories is likely to be borne in large part by foreign
producers.
The value of oil imported in the third quarter was about the
same as recorded in the second quarter. The quantity of oil imports
remained near 8.2 mb/d as an increase in domestic consumption was
offset by a lower rate of stockbuilding. Weekly Department of

Energy data indicate that stocks were drawn down rapidly in October
(depressing imports), as market participants apparently expected

IV-4
prices to recede; this expectation was evidenced by a large discount
of long term futures relative to near-term futures over most of
October.
Spot oil prices have fallen almost $3 per barrel since late
October, likely reflecting strong production by OPEC coupled with
sluggish economic activity world wide. However, given past
increases in spot prices and shipping and contract lags, import
prices are likely to have increased through November.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of non-oil imports (as reported by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS)) rose 0.5 percent in October, the second
consecutive month of increase. These increases followed five months
of declining prices. The largest increase in October was in
automotive imports and reflected introduction of the new 1992 model
year vehicles. All other major categories of imports showed small
increases in prices with the exception of consumer goods, which
remained unchanged from September.
Prices of nonagricultural exports increased 0.2 percent in
October, with increases recorded in every major category. October
was the second consecutive month of increase, following seven months
of flat or falling prices. Prices of agricultural exports increased
3.5 percent in October, paced by an increase in the price of wheat.
National Income and Product Account fixed-weight prices will
not be available until December 20th. The fixed-weight prices for
the third quarter from the BLS showed a 3.2 percent decline in
prices of non-oil imports and a 1.8 percent decline in prices of
non-agricultural exports. Both non-oil imports and nonagricultural
exports showed the largest declines in the industrial supplies
category.

U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account balance fell from a surplus of $12.1
(SAAR) billion in the second quarter to a deficit of $41.8 billion
in the third quarter, as the balance on both trade and transfers
deteriorated. Net transfers declined by $36.3 billion (AR), largely
the result of a $28 billion (AR) reduction in cash grants from
coalition partners in Operation Desert Storm and the provision of
$11.6 billion (AR) in debt forgiveness to several countries,
including Poland. (Approximately $1.2 billion (AR) of these grants
was used to pay interest arrears, boosting portfolio receipts). Net
service receipts rose slightly with an increase in receipts from
foreigners traveling in the United States and a small gain in net
military transactions.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Banks and securities firms in the United States reported
substantial capital outflows in October, partially reversing the
inflows reported in the third quarter (line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table). These month-end data have swung
widely this year. Contributing to these swings have been sharp
movements in lending by securities firms to Bermuda and the
Netherlands Antilles to finance holdings of U.S. Treasury securities
by certain mutual funds.
There was a small net outflow of $4.1 billion on securities
transactions for the third quarter, which continued into October
(lines 2 plus 3). A major element was the continued robust level of
net purchases of foreign securities by U.S. residents ($13 billion
for the third quarter and $6.5 billion in October, line 2c). The
cumulative flow for the first three quarters has already surpassed
the previous annual record registered in 1990. Two-thirds of the
third quarter outflow was for net stock purchases, but in October
the share shifted heavily toward foreign bonds. In September and
October, a large share of the stock purchases was in Japan (a total
of $2.4 billion). In October, purchases of foreign bonds by U.S.
residents rose to $4.2 billion; they were primarily from the United
Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, from Canada.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds were substantial,
for both the third quarter and October (line 2a). By contrast,
foreign net purchases of U.S. stocks were small in the third quarter
and virtually zero in September and October (line 2b). Foreign net
purchases of Treasury obligations were also very small (line 3).
Foreign official reserves in the United States fell by $6.2
billion in September, limiting the overall increase in the third
quarter to $3.5 billion (line 4). For the quarter, substantial

increases were registered by Taiwan, Spain and Mexico, with
decreases in OPEC countries and Japan. In October, official
holdings rose an additional $6.3 billion, with major increases
reported for the United Kingdom, the BIS, and Taiwan.
Recently released data show virtually no capital inflow in the
third quarter for foreign direct investment in the United States
(line 7); although the second quarter inflow was revised upward, the
total inflow in 1991 through three quarters ($13.2 billion) is less
than half of the corresponding inflow last year ($32.7 billion).
Direct investment outflows were $5.9 billion in the third quarter
(line 6); given the cumulative outflow through three quarters ($19.6
billion), it is likely that, for the year, U.S. direct investment
abroad will outweigh foreign direct investment in the United States.
The statistical discrepancy for the third quarter was
essentially zero, and the discrepancy for the second quarter was
revised downward by over $13 billion to $8.5 billion (line 10).
More than half of the revision was the result of the correction of a
reporting error, where a bank had reported its customers' claims in
lira rather than dollars.
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting the dollar's weighted average
exchange value has depreciated just over 2 percent, on balance. The
weakness of the dollar reflects the sluggish pace of the U.S.
recovery, which has heightened prospects for further easing by the
Federal Reserve on top of the two easings during the period. Most
of the dollar's decline has come against the mark. The dollar fell
about 3-1/4 percent against the mark while declining only 1/4
percent against the yen. The dollar had been even weaker earlier,
but very late in the period firmed fairly sharply on renewed
tensions in the Soviet Union.

The dollar has tended to fluctuate more in terms of the mark
than the yen during the intermeeting period. This volatility was
in part the result of speculation that an EMS realignment could take
place prior to or following the Maastricht summit meeting, and also
reflects the rapid pace of developments in the former Soviet Union.
While the likelihood of an EMS realignment has subsided for the
short term, developments in the former Soviet Union are likely to
add volatility to dollar/mark rates for the foreseeable future.
The mark has been supported by the expectation that interest
rates will rise in Germany. This speculation has been fed by
statements from Bundesbank officials indicating that the current
level of German inflation is unacceptably high, and that interest
rates in Germany will not be able to come down and may have to rise.
Following the Bundesbank Council meeting on December 5, the
Bundesbank announced that it would raise its target range for M3
growth to 3.5 to 5.5 percent for 1992 from 3 percent to 5 percent
for 1991. An increase of this magnitude was perceived as a slight
tightening, as growth of 4 to 6 percent was judged to be necessary
to accommodate fully the anticipated demand for currency in Eastern
Germany. Although the Bundesbank did not raise official lending
rates at this meeting, perhaps so as not to exacerbate tensions in
the EMS prior to the Maastricht summit meeting, market participants
continue to expect that it will raise the Lombard rate within the
next month or so. Since November 5, three-month interest rates in
Germany have risen by 8 basis points to a level of 9.45 percent; and
the yield on the bellwether bond has come down 10 basis points to
8.28 percent.
The mark has also been affected by developments in the former
Soviet Union. During the intermeeting period, the mark has been
weighed on by predictions of an imminent second Soviet coup,

IV-13
questions over the ability of the Soviets to repay their foreign
debt, and uncertainty over the nature of future government(s) in
that territory. This latter form of uncertainty was exacerbated by
the decision of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of
Byelorussia to form a commonwealth and to end the USSR. Very late
in the period tensions were heightened further by the conflict
between Yeltsin and Gorbachev over the control of the military.
Developments in the former Soviet Union are likely to have a
continuing impact on the mark.
The dollar's smaller decline against the yen was partly due to
the weakness of Japan's economy and the expectation of further
interest rate decreases in Japan. Since the last FOMC meeting, the
Bank of Japan has cut its official discount rate by 1/2 percentage
point to 5 percent, and market participants perceive that it has
eased its target rate for call money 25 basis points to around 6.25
percent. Three month interest rates in Japan have come down 10
basis points to 6.10 percent, and the yield on the bellwether bond
has fallen 36 basis points to 5.65 percent. The yen has also been
weakened by the slumping Japanese equity market; the Nikkei Dow fell
just under 14 percent during the intermeeting period.
The mark's strength has also placed a large amount of
strain on EMS currencies and other currencies pegged to the ECU.
The exchange rate pressure caused by the mark appreciation has
prompted some central banks to increase interest rates to defend

IV-14
their currencies. The Bank of France raised its money market
intervention rate 1/2 percentage point to 9-1/4 percent and raised
its 5 to 10 day RP rate 1/4 percentage point to 10 percent; the Bank
of Italy raised its rate on fixed-term advances by 1/2 percentage
point to 12 percent; and the Bank of Sweden raised its marginal
lending rate 6 percentage points to 17.5 percent.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent data on economic activity in the foreign industrial
countries have provided further evidence of relatively weak growth
in the third quarter, with few indications yet of a revival in the
fourth quarter. Real GNP declined in Germany in the third quarter,
the second consecutive quarterly decline. In Japan, third quarter
real GNP growth eased further to below 2 percent. Real GDP in both
Canada and the United Kingdom grew only about 1 percent in the third
quarter, and, in the case of the United Kingdom, growth was
accounted for entirely by increased oil and gas output. The Italian
recovery appears to have stalled, as industrial production declined
in the third quarter. Only in France, where marketable GDP grew at
more than a 3 percent rate in the third quarter, have there been
clear signs of strength.
The trend of generally reduced inflation rates in the foreign
industrial countries has on balance continued. The most recent
monthly data showed reduced 12-month inflation rates in France, the
United Kingdom, and Canada. However, there were recent monthly
upticks in inflation rates in Germany and Japan.
Individual country notes. In Japan, the pace of real GNP
growth has continued to slacken. In the third quarter, real GNP
grew 1.6 percent (s.a.a.r.), compared with rates of 8.3 percent and
2.8 percent in the preceding two quarters. Consumption growth eased
(to 3.6 percent) in the third quarter while plant and equipment

IV-18
investment resumed positive growth (up 2.6 percent) and housing
investment remained negative (down 8.6 percent). Inventory
investment and net exports both had about neutral impacts on third-
quarter growth.
Recent monthly indicators of activity have been mixed. New
machinery orders (s.a.) rose for the third consecutive month in
September and were 20.8 percent above their year-earlier level. The
index of leading indicators was at its highest level in 13 months in
September. New passenger car registrations (s.a.) rose 3.1 percent
in October, but remained 4.7 percent below their level of last
October. Industrial production (s.a.) declined by 0.4 percent in
October, falling 2.1 percent below its year-earlier level. Housing
starts (s.a.) fell for the fifth consecutive month in October and
showed a cumulative decline of 25.4 percent over the previous 12
months. The unemployment rate (s.a.) declined to 2 percent in
October, returning to its record low level reached earlier in the
year. However, a more sensitive measure of job market conditions,
the job offers to applicants ratio (s.a.), declined for the third
consecutive month in October, falling 9.5 percent below its recent
peak.
Underlying inflationary pressures appear to have remained about
unchanged. In November, the 12-month increase of consumer prices in
the Tokyo area rose to 3.7 percent. However, most of this increase
was due to a weather-related jump in the price of perishable foods.
Excluding these items, the 12-month consumer price inflation rate
eased to 2.6 percent. Wholesale prices showed a 12-month decrease
of 0.9 percent.
The trade surplus (s.a.) remained above its year-earlier level
in November as it has in each month this year. Through the first 11
months of the year, the trade surplus was $77.4 billion (a.r.), over

IV-19
$20 billion larger than the surplus rate in the same period last
year.
Real GNP in western Germany (adjusted for seasonal and calendar
variations) fell at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the third
quarter, after falling 2.4 percent the second quarter. A sharp 7.2
percent decline in private consumption was the main cause of the
third-quarter decline. Increases in payroll and income taxes are
thought to have been major factors behind the drop in consumption in
the third quarter. The decline in consumption was partially offset
by strong west German exports (including shipments to eastern
Germany). West German exports increased 19.5 percent (a.r.) in the
third quarter after falling 7.7 percent in the second quarter. Net
exports contributed 2.2 percentage points to third-quarter growth.
A run-off of inventories reduced third-quarter GNP growth by 0.9
percentage point.
Recent monthly indicators have been mixed. Preliminary data
suggest that industrial production in western Germany (s.a.) fell 1
percent in October after increasing 0.5 percent in September. The
volume of new orders for west German manufactured goods (s.a.) fell
0.2 percent in October after falling 2.5 percent in September.
However, these declines follow a cumulative increase of 4.2 percent
between April and August. In September, the volume of retail sales
(s.a.) in western Germany increased 0.3 percent after falling 4.8
percent over the previous two months. The west German unemployment
rate (s.a.) remained at 6.3 in October and November after declining
0.1 percentage point in September.
Industrial production in eastern Germany (n.s.a.) fell 5.2
percent in August after posting large gains between April and July.
New orders for east German manufactured goods (n.s.a.) increased
19.1 percent in August and were up almost 25 percent since May. New

IV-20
construction orders in eastern Germany (n.s.a.) have increased
steadily since February, and August's level was 77 percent above the
average level for the second half of 1990. The overall status of
the labor market has improved since the second quarter. The east
German unemployment rate (n.s.a.) increased 0.2 percentage point to
11.9 percent in October, but it remained below the July peak of 12.1
percent. Short-time workers declined to 13.6 percent of the labor
force in October, down from 21.5 percent in June.
West German consumer prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.4 percent in
November, and on a year-over-year basis, consumer price inflation
increased from 3.5 percent in October to 4.2 percent in November.
West German wholesale prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.3 percent in
October, and on a year-over-year basis, wholesale price inflation
was 0.7 percent in October, compared with 1 percent in September.
West German import prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.2 percent in October
to a level 2.5 percent below where they were the year before.
Accelerating unit labor costs in western Germany continue to be
a source of concern. Average hourly earnings in western Germany
increased 8.6 percent in the year to September, compared with 6.4
percent at the end of last year. In contrast, output per hour in
west German industry increased only 2.1 percent in the year to
August, compared with 3.8 percent at the end of last year.
Negotiations over wage agreements for 1992 are in the early stages.
Negotiations covering public sector employees and the metalworkers
have not formally begun, but the unions have indicated that they
will demand increases of more than 10 percent.
For the third quarter as a whole, the combined German trade
balance (s.a.) was in surplus by $9 billion (a.r.), compared with a
$1.6 billion deficit in the second quarter. Exports (s.a.)
increased 5 percent in the third quarter, while imports increased

IV-21
2.1 percent. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the trade surplus
increased from $11 billion (a.r.) in September to $16 billion in
October. The combined German current account deficit (s.a.) fell to
$14.2 billion (a.r.) in the third quarter from $22.6 billion in the
second quarter. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the current
account deficit increased from $12 billion (a.r.) in September to
$22 billion in October.
The combined deficit for federal, state, and local governments
is expected to widened to 4-3/4 percent of GNP (DM 135 billion) in
1991. The lower house of the German parliament has approved a 1992
budget with a projected public sector deficit equal to 4-1/4 percent
of GNP (DM 125 billion). However, the upper house, which is not
controlled by Chancellor Kohl's coalition, has blocked final
approval of a variety of tax changes, including a 1 percentage point
increase in the VAT rate that is scheduled to take effect at the
beginning of 1993.
In France, the economic recovery that began in the second
quarter appears to have continued into the third and fourth
quarters. Marketable GDP, a reliable preliminary indicator of total
GDP, rose 3.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in both the second and third
quarters. Monthly indicators of economic activity, which appeared
to weaken at the end of the third quarter, with industrial
production (s.a.) falling one percent in September, have recovered
so far in the fourth quarter. Increases (s.a.) were registered in
October in business output and orders, retail sales, exports, and
consumption of manufactured products. A less favorable development
was a slight increase in the unemployment rate (s.a.) in October to
9.7 percent.
The consumer price index in October was only 2.5 percent above
its level a year earlier, down from 2.6 percent in the previous

IV-22
month. This slowing in inflation is supported by continued moderate
wage growth, with hourly wages rising 4.7 percent in October from
their level a year earlier, down from 4.8 percent in July.
In October, France registered a trade surplus (s.a.) of $1.2
billion, its largest in over ten years. Even after an adjustment to
exports for two special items, the sale of a cruise ship and the
launch of a satellite, this surplus remains substantial at $0.5
billion. This strong trade performance is primarily the result of
strong export growth, suggesting that the external sector has
continued to be a source of strength in the fourth quarter.
In Italy, a modest and uneven recovery appeared to stall during
the summer, following an increase in GDP of 1.2 percent (s.a.a.r.)
in the second quarter. Industrial production (s.a.) rose a
preliminary 3.2 percent in September following two months of
declines. The average for the third quarter was down 0.2 percent
from the previous quarter. Household confidence (n.s.a.) dropped
sharply in October, possibly portending a slowdown in previously
strong growth in consumer spending that was the main source of
demand growth during the first half of the year.
Inflation has slowed in Italy but remains well above rates in
its key EMS partners, Germany and France. Consumer prices in
November were 6.2 percent above their level a year earlier, up
slightly from the 6.1 percent rise of October. Wholesale prices in
September were 2.1 percent above a year earlier, down from 3.1
percent in August.
Italy's trade deficit has widened in the past few months as
exports have fallen noticeably from last year. The cumulative trade
deficit for January through October was $14.2 billion (s.a.a.r.),
somewhat above last year's $12.1 billion. Preliminary data on the
Italian current account show a deficit of $12.3 billion (n.s.a.)

IV-23
during the first half of 1991, compared with a deficit of $11.2
billion in the same period a year earlier.
The United Kingdom appears to have recorded positive growth in
the third quarter of 1991, the first such increase since the second
quarter of 1990. A provisional measure of real GDP grew 1.2 percent
(s.a.a.r) in the third quarter after it fell by a cumulative 3.7
percent since the onset of the recession. However, the growth in
real GDP was entirely accounted for by a rebound in North Sea oil
production; excluding oil and gas, real GDP fell 1.2 percent
(s.a.a.r) in the third quarter. Although most sectors of the
economy, including services and manufacturing, appear to have
bottomed out, there is little evidence of recovery from the
recession in the most recent data. Retail sales (s.a.) fell in
October to a level 0.8 percent below the third-quarter average.
After increasing steadily since the Gulf War ended, consumer
confidence (n.s.a.) fell back a bit in October and November, giving
rise to fears that the United Kingdom could slide into a double-dip
recession. Housing starts were flat in the three months from August
to October compared with the previous three months. However,
unemployment (s.a.) leveled off at a rate of 8.7 percent in October.
The year-over-year inflation rate has more than halved during
the past year; consumer price inflation fell to 3.7 percent in
October compared with a peak rate of 10.9 percent a year ago. The
government's measure of underlying inflation, which excludes
mortgage interest rates, stood at 5.5 percent in the year to
October, down from a rate of 9.5 percent last October. Producer
prices (n.s.a.) rose 0.4 percent in November to stand 5.1 percent
above year-ago levels.
In the annual Autumn statement, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Lamont announced a sharp rise in government spending for the 1992-93

IV-24
fiscal year starting next April. While some of the increase in
spending is due to the cyclical downturn, there also are
discretionary increases in spending on health, transportation, and
pensions.
In Canada, real GDP rose 0.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third
quarter, after increasing at a revised 5.7 percent rate in the
second quarter. However, the level of GDP was still about 1.3
percent below its peak in the first quarter of 1990. Total domestic
demand increased 4.2 percent in the third quarter, but the external
balance was much weaker, as exports were unable .to keep up with the
26 percent growth in imports. The 2 percent increase in investment
was due entirely to continued strength in residential construction,
which grew 17 percent, as spending on non-residential structures and
machinery and equipment declined.
Recent monthly data suggest that the recovery remains
tentative. The unemployment rate (s.a.) rose from 10.2 percent to
10.3 percent in October, partially reversing September's 0.4
percentage point decline. In September, factory shipments (s.a.)
fell 0.4 percent, new orders (s.a.) were down 0.3 percent, and
retail sales excluding automobiles (s.a.) declined 0.4 percent,
erasing a modest increase in August. However, industrial production
(s.a.) increased 0.6 percent in September, housing starts (s.a.)
rose 12 percent in October, and motor vehicle sales (s.a.) were up
13 percent in September.
October price data suggest that the government's anti-inflation
efforts are bearing fruit. The all-items consumer price index
(n.s.a.) posted its second consecutive 0.2 percent decline, causing
twelve-month inflation to fall from 5.4 percent to 4.4 percent. The
CPI excluding food and energy (n.s.a.) was up 0.2 percent in
October, but has increased only 3.5 percent (a.r.) since the 7

IV-25
percent Goods and Services Tax was introduced in January.
Industrial product prices were unchanged after seven consecutive
monthly declines, for a twelve-month decrease of 2.4 percent. Wage
settlements rose 3.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, their
smallest increase in five years.
The current account deficit (s.a.) increased sharply to a
record high $25.1 billion (a.r.) in the third quarter, as Canada's
September merchandise trade balance (s.a.) showed its first monthly
deficit in 15 years.
Developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern European Countries
While the political structure of the former Soviet Union
evolves, the economic situation continues to deteriorate. The
fiscal situation has worsened steadily as expenditures continue to
grow and republics withhold revenues from the central government.
Parliamentary refusal in late November to increase the center's
deficit financing this year provoked a fiscal crisis, as Gosbank
(the central bank) claimed to have insufficient funds. Russian
President Yeltsin subsequently agreed to provide resources to
finance the union budget and guarantee Gosbank credits. The central
government has been weakened by Russian assumption of control of
many functions that were once centrally administered, by Ukraine's
overwhelming vote in favor of independence on December 1, and by the
creation of a Commonwealth of Independent States by the Russian
Republic, Ukraine, and Byelorussia on December 8.
In early December, Gosbank removed controls on the fixed
tourist exchange rate of 47 rubles per dollar. Subsequently, the
Soviet Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs (Vneshekonombank or VEB)
started trading hard currency at market-determined rates of about 90
rubles per dollar. By December 10, the rate was quoted as high as
170 rubles per dollar.

IV-26
In late November, G-7 countries agreed to defer Soviet
principal repayments on foreign debt, to support short-term credit
lines and guarantees provided by G-7 export credit agencies, and to
offer an emergency financing facility of up to $1 billion in a swap
against gold. The republics agreed to seek comparable treatment
from other official and private sector creditors and to cooperate
closely with the IMF to implement appropriate macroeconomic and
structural reform programs. Approximately $3.6 billion in payments
due to G-7 creditors through the end of 1992 are expected to be
deferred. Prior to negotiating this agreement, Soviet republics
agreed to assume joint and several responsibility for servicing the
country's foreign debt that is currently estimated at over $70
billion.
On December 5, VEB informed commercial banks that principal
payments would be halted on all loans contracted before January 1,
1991. At a meeting on December 6, commercial bank creditors and the
Soviets discussed a postponement of principal payments due in the
first quarter of 1992.
In Eastern Europe, Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak
Federal Republic reached agreement with the European Community (EC)
at the end of November to expand market access for their exports to
the EC. The three Eastern European countries have also signed an
agreement setting a framework to free trade among themselves over
the next five years. Further, in early December the United States
passed legislation allowing permanent most favored nation status for
the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, Hungary, and the Baltics.
In Poland, the lower house of parliament (SEJM) elected lawyer
and civil rights activist Jan Olszewski to be the new Prime
Minister. Key differences in economic policy among the members of
the coalition of center-right.parties that backs Olszewski remain to

IV-27
be resolved. Also, President Walesa nominated Hanna Gronkeiwicz-
Waltz, a banking law specialist at Warsaw University, to head
Poland's central bank.
Industrial sales rose 9.4 percent in October (largely
reflecting seasonal factors) but remain 21.5 percent below a year
earlier. The unemployment rate rose 1.0 percent to 11.8 percent in
November. October inflation was 3.2 percent, and prices are 64.8
percent above year-earlier levels.
In Hungary, Prime Minister Antall named Industry and Trade
Minister Peter Akos Bod as president of the Central Bank, succeeding
Gyorgy Suranyi. The replacement of the respected independent
Suranyi was allowed by the recently approved central bank law that
restructured the Central Bank along Western lines. The government
has stated that current policies, which have helped to reduce
inflation substantially since January 1991, will not change.
Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in October to a level 33.9 percent
above their year-ago level. Industrial production fell slightly in
September and has declined 18.8 percent in the first nine months of
1991 compared with the same period in 1990. In October, the
unemployment rate rose 0.5 percentage point to 6.6 percent.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
The Mexican government unified the controlled and free exchange
rates in mid-November and modified its managed exchange rate policy.
At the same time, it renewed its anti-inflation pact with business
and organized labor. On November 18, IMF Managing Director
Camdessus announced plans to complete agreement with Argentina on a
three-year Extended Fund Facility stand-by arrangement by the end of
the first quarter of 1992. The Brazilian congress is considering a
tax proposal that must be approved if Brazil is to have a chance of
receiving a 20-month, $2 billion IMF stand-by arrangement. Drawings

IV-28
by Venezuela on its Extended Fund Facility arrangement with the IMF
have resumed. The Venezuelan government sold 40 percent of the
shares of the national telephone company on November 15. An IMF
mission to the Philippines last month withheld its approval of the
government's 1992 economic program pending congressional passage of
tax measures. In Korea, rapid economic activity has continued to
put pressure on prices and to stimulate import growth. In Taiwan,
economic activity has picked up this year due to stronger exports
and rising public investment.
Individual country notes. On November 11, the Mexican
government unified the controlled and free peso exchange rates and
moved to a "target zone" exchange rate policy whose limits will be
depreciated against the dollar by 20 centavos per day, or 2.4
percent at an annual rate. The controlled rate had been crawling by
40 centavos per dollar per day since November 1990. The free rate
had been very close to it for about a year and often was slightly
above it. Since the new policy was announced, the peso has firmed
against the dollar. On December 9, the rate was 0.4 percent higher
than the controlled rate on November 8.
At the same time, the anti-inflation pact between government,
business, and organized labor, which was due to expire at the end of
1991, was extended until January 31, 1993. The agreement raised
minimum wages by 12 percent, lowered the value-added tax from 15 to
10 percent, and raised various administered prices. With the price
increases, the CPI, which rose by 1.2 percent in October, jumped by
2.5 percent in November and is likely to rise nearly as much again
in December. As a result, interest rates firmed in late November,
but then eased when the authorities allowed market liquidity to
rise. At the December 3 auction, the 28-day Treasury bill rate was
16.11 percent, down from 16.24 percent on November 12.

IV-29
Mexico's cumulative trade deficit for January-September was
$3.95 billion, up from $0.5 billion in the same period of 1990.
Imports were 25 percent higher than a year earlier, and exports were
10 percent higher. While the monthly trade deficit continued to
grow, the capital inflows slowed after the Bank of Mexico, in
August, imposed reserve requirements against Euro-currency
certificates of deposit issued by Mexican banks. As a result,
international reserves, including gold and the proceeds from the
privatization of the telephone system, fell to $16.7 billion on
October 31 from their July peak, estimated at about $18.4 billion.
The 1992 budget, sent to the Mexican congress on November 15,
calls for an overall surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP, excluding
privatization revenues. The 1991 overall fiscal deficit, excluding
privatization revenues, originally budgeted at 1.9 percent of GDP,
is now officially estimated at 1.3 percent of GDP.
In July and August, industrial production was 2.9 percent
higher than a year earlier. This is about the same rate of increase
as in the second quarter.
On November 18, IMF Managing Director Camdessus announced plans
to complete an agreement with Argentina on a three-year Extended
Fund Facility arrangement by the end of the first quarter of 1992.
Argentina seeks to convert its current one-year IMF stand-by, which
was approved in July 1991, into a three-year EFF arrangement in
order to acquire the financing necessary to support a debt-reduction
package with its commercial bank creditors. However, it will need a
waiver to receive the second drawing under its stand-by arrangement,
since a greater fraction of the overall fiscal surplus for the third
quarter derived from asset sales than was specified under the
arrangement. The waiver is expected to be approved, in part because

IV-30
preliminary data show that the deviation from this target was
considerably smaller in October.
In late November, Argentina declared plans to open negotiations
with the commercial banks by January 1992. Argentina currently is
making monthly interest payments of $60 million on its medium- and
long-term debt to commercial banks, compared with interest
obligations of about $170 million monthly; the stock of interest
arrears exceeds $8 billion.
To maintain the pace of fiscal reform, Argentina announced on
November 13 that it aims to complete its privatization program by
end-1992, by selling waterworks, utilities, railways, and other
companies worth an estimated $10 to $20 billion. A decree of
October 31 removes controls in many areas of economic activity and
eliminates some financial taxes.
Monthly consumer price inflation dropped to 0.4 percent in
November from 1.4 percent in October, the lowest rate in several
decades. Industrial activity in September, while still below the
levels reached in 1988, was 9.2 percent higher than a year earlier.
In Brazil, congress is presently considering a tax proposal
that must be approved if Brazil is to have a chance of receiving a
20-month, $2 billion IMF stand-by arrangement. In the letter of
intent supporting its request for the stand-by, the government
proposes to achieve a primary budgetary surplus equal to 3 percent
of GDP in 1992 and 4 percent of GDP in 1993, and promises to reduce
inflation to 2 percent per month by the end of 1992. If Congress
passes the tax package, which is likely, Executive Board approval is
expected in early January.
Negotiations with creditor banks on the restructuring of
Brazil's medium and long-term external debt resumed December 4.

IV-31
Negotiations have stalled since September because banks want rolling
interest guarantees, which Brazil is resisting.
Since the privatization of USIMINAS (steel) for $1.15 billion
in late October, three small government enterprises have been sold.
Inflation is still very high. The "preliminary" General Price
Index, which covers the 30 days through November 20, rose by 25.6
percent, compared with calendar-month increases of 25.9 percent and
16.2 percent in October and September, respectively. Real GDP rose
by nearly 1 percent for the year through September, following a
decline of 4 percent in 1990. Available data and anecdotal evidence
indicate that economic activity since late September has fallen in
response to record high real interest rates (even for Brazil). The
30-day bank certificate of deposit rate was recently 35 percent per
month, or about 10 percent per month in real terms.
The recorded trade surplus for July to October was $2.2
billion, compared with $3.6 billion over the same period in 1990.
The decline in the surplus reflects trade liberalization and
underinvoicing of exports and overinvoicing of imports to facilitate
capital flight. The latest official estimate of liquid inter-
national reserves is $7 billion at the end of September, compared
with a recent peak of $9.2 billion in June. However, high domestic
real interest rates have induced capital inflows recently.
International reserves rose by $400 million in the first week of
December. Capital inflows through the parallel market helped narrow
the spread between the parallel and official exchange rate to less
than 3 percent on December 9, the lowest in years.
Since August, the Venezuelan government has taken steps to
limit the 1991 fiscal deficit to 1.2 percent of GDP. In light of
these corrective measures, the IMF approved a Venezuelan drawing
under its Extended Fund Facility arrangement. The Fund also

IV-32
extended the arrangement for six months, to March 1993, and rephased
two quarterly purchases originally scheduled for this year to the
final half-year of the arrangement. Having been unable to make all
the IMF purchases planned for 1991, Venezuela will need waivers from
the commercial banks providing new money bonds under the country's
1990 debt restructuring agreement in order to issue the third and
last tranche of these bonds, for $300 million, in January 1992.
The Venezuelan government began privatizing the national
telephone company on November 15 when it sold 40 percent of the
shares to a consortium, including GTE and ATT. The winning bid was
$1.9 billion, well above the government's minimum of $800 million.
The government's remaining stake in the company is to be sold later.
Venezuela's strong recovery from the deep recession of 1989 is
continuing. Real GDP growth for 1991 is projected to exceed 7
percent. Partly as a result, inflation has not fallen this year as
the authorities had hoped; in November, the CPI was 32 percent
higher than a year earlier.
An IMF mission to the Philippines in November withheld its
approval of the government's 1992 economic program pending
congressional passage of a package of new tax measures. The
Philippines missed its June and September IMF targets and is
currently out of compliance with its IMF program. The IMF has given
the Philippines until the end of this year to enact the revenue
package, but congress has been reluctant to act until after the May
1992 presidential and congressional elections. Congress will recess
shortly, but may reconvene in January to consider the tax package.
In Korea, rapid economic activity has continued to put pressure
on prices and to stimulate import growth. However, real GNP growth
slowed somewhat to 8.1 percent at an annual rate in the third
quarter of 1991 from 9 percent in the first half, in-part due to a

IV-33
large decline in the growth of export volumes. Consumer prices were
9.8 percent higher in November than a year earlier. The current
account deficit rose to a record $9.2 billion in the first eleven
months of 1991 from $1.2 billion in the same period of last year, as
a steep rise in imports of oil and capital goods more than offset a
recovery in exports.
In Taiwan, economic activity has picked up this year due to
stronger exports and rising public investment. In the first three
quarters of 1991, real GNP expanded 7.3 percent at an annual rate
compared with 5 percent in 1990. In the first eleven months of
1991, the cumulative trade surplus (on a customs basis) was $12.4
billion, up slightly from $11.9 billion in the same period of last
year. Inflation has risen somewhat this year. Consumer prices were
5.3 percent higher in November than a year earlier; this compares
with 3.9 percent in the same period last year.
