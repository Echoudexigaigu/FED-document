The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The economy has continued to struggle. In the fourth
quarter, the only bright spots in final demand were strong growth in
exports and the continued uptrend in homebuilding. With real
incomes flat and confidence depressed, retail sales were weak during
the holiday shopping season. Although there was a spurt in business
purchases of computers in the fall, overall investment spending
continued to be dragged down by weak nonresidential construction
activity. In response to the sluggishness in aggregate final demand
and the emergence of some inventory imbalances, factory output was
flat in December and probably declined in January. Slack in labor
and product markets has damped wage and price increases; underlying
inflation trends appear to be headed downward.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor market conditions remained poor in December. Private
payroll employment fell another 35,000 in December, and the
unemployment rate moved up to 7.1 percent. However, a lengthening
of the workweek led to a small rise in aggregate hours of production
or nonsupervisory workers in December, and the average level of
hours in the fourth quarter was about the same as in the third
quarter.
Payroll reductions were widespread in December. Manufacturing
employment moved down another 32,000, the fourth consecutive monthly
decline. Nearly all of the recent factory job losses have been in
durable goods industries. Construction employment, depressed by
unseasonably severe weather in November, failed to recover much in
December; on net, this industry continued to lose jobs at a rapid
pace in the fourth quarter. In retail trade, hiring for the holiday
shopping season was well below the seasonal norm. The shutdowns of
Pan Am and Midway airlines led to sizable job losses in

transportation. Services was the only private industry to post
notable job gains in December, and health services accounted for all
of the advance.
Local government employment was reported to be up sharply in
December; however, figures for this sector are often revised
appreciably and, given the fiscal problems of local governments, the
size of the increase appears fishy. But even discounting the
December figures, employment in local governments was up for the
fourth quarter as a whole, apparently reflecting continued hiring by
relatively healthy governments at the same time that many planned
layoffs have yet to materialize.
The monthly survey of households also pointed to continued
labor market weakness in December. Total employment registered
another small decline, and the number of unemployed rose nearly
300,000, pushing the civilian unemployment rate up 0.2 percentage
point in December.
Sentiment about the state of the labor market--as evidenced,
for example, by the Conference Board's survey question about whether
jobs are plentiful or hard to get--is currently near the lows of the
1982 recession. However, the data do not seem consistent with such
negative assessments. To be sure, one should view the current labor
market indicators cautiously. The BLS has recently indicated that
it anticipates a sizable downward revision to payroll employment
when it releases its benchmark revisions later this year. In
addition, the dramatic slowing in labor force growth raises
questions about the interpretation of the recent behavior of the
unemployment rate. The accompanying table presents a range of labor
market indicators for the fourth quarter of 1982 (the trough of the
last recession) and for the fourth quarter of 1991. Virtually every
one of these indicators was weaker in 1982 than in 1991.

Perhaps most interesting are the regional data. Even in the
Northeast--where the current recession has been the most severe, and
where the 1982 recession was the mildest--the current unemployment
rate is significantly lower than it was in 1982. Similarly, all six
major occupational groups had lower unemployment rates in late 1991
than in 1982. The same is true of the "U-7" measure of
unemployment, which adjusts the unemployment rate to take account of
discouraged workers and involuntary part-time workers.
The only labor market indicator to deteriorate more in the
current episode than in 1982 is the labor force participation rate,
which has fallen 0.4 percentage point since the business-cycle peak
in the summer of 1990. The December labor market report provided
information on individuals who are out of the labor force--that is,
nonparticipants--during the fourth quarter (table). Since the
fourth quarter of 1989 (when the participation rate reached its
peak), the number of nonparticipants has been growing more than
300,000 per quarter. In contrast, during the three years of labor
market weakness ending in 1982:Q4, the number of nonparticipants
increased, on average, 191,000 persons per quarter. The difference
is even more striking when it is recognized that the working-age
population was growing more rapidly in the earlier period.
The increase in nonparticipation relative,to the 1979 to 1982
period can be traced to those who report that they do not want a job
now, particularly those who characterize themselves as "at school"
or "ill." Comparing the growth in nonparticipation during these two
recessionary periods with the growth during the long expansion from
1982 to 1989 makes clear that some of the components of
nonparticipation--even among individuals who claim not to want a job
now--display cyclicality. For example, during the expansionary
period, stronger job prospects helped draw people out of school,

while the number of nonparticipants in school increased during the
two recessionary periods. Also, the number of nonparticipants
keeping house declined at a faster rate when the economy was
expanding. These findings suggest that, even though many
nonparticipants claim not to want a job now, some nevertheless will
enter the labor market when job opportunities improve.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production contracted somewhat in November and
December and finished the year at about the same level as it reached
in July when the recovery in the industrial sector faltered. Output
has been held down in recent months by a decline in motor vehicle
production; assemblies were 9.3 million units at an annual rate (FRB
seasonals) in December versus 10.0 million in October. In addition,
production at utilities has been held down since September by
unseasonably warm weather, which has damped the demand for natural
gas and electricity.
Total industrial production excluding motor vehicles and
utilities was essentially flat, on balance, in November and
December. Output of consumer durable goods retraced part of the
gains registered during the summer, owing largely to a decline in
demand for appliances and other household goods such as carpeting
and furniture. By contrast, output of nondurable consumer goods
continued to advance, reflecting increases in production of a wide
variety of items, including food, clothing, and chemicals.
Production of business equipment other than motor vehicles was
held down in November and December by a decline in industrial
equipment, reflecting an ongoing strike at Caterpillar, Inc.
However, production in other equipment-producing industries has
begun to firm in recent months after showing virtually no
improvement since its low in March. In particular, computer

production has picked up noticeably, apparently reflecting stepped-
up production of IBM's new generation of mainframes as well as of
other types of information-processing equipment.
Total industrial production may have contracted appreciably
further this month. Through late January, domestic producers are
estimated to have assembled autos and trucks at only an 8-1/4
million unit pace (FRB seasonals)--down sharply from the rate
recorded in December, and considerably less than makers' reported
schedules. Domestic manufacturers are currently planning for a
rebound in motor vehicle assemblies in February to just a touch
under the level during the fourth quarter of last year. Other
weekly measures of industrial activity for the first couple of weeks
in January were mixed: Production of steel and lumber was up
slightly, while output of appliances continued to decline.

Capacity utilization in manufacturing fell almost

rising somewhat from its earlier low in March. The operating rate
for advanced processing industries has fallen back in the past few
months to a level that is about 4 percentage points below the
average during 1967-90. The recent declines mainly reflect reduced
output of motor vehicles and nonelectrical machinery other than
computers. Capacity utilization at primary processing industries

has decreased relatively little since the summer and stands just
slightly below its 1967-90 average.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal personal income rose at a 3-1/4 percent annual rate in
the fourth quarter. However, after adjusting for taxes and
inflation, real DPI increased only 1/2 percent, bringing growth over
the four quarters of the year to an anemic 0.4 percent. Among the
components of nominal income, wages and salaries increased at about
a 2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, as increases in
hourly compensation and the workweek offset sizable job losses.
Although transfer payments increased rapidly in the fourth quarter
of last year, personal tax payments also were up. Elsewhere,
personal dividend income posted a small increase, while personal
interest income continued to trend lower, reflecting the general
reduction in interest rates that has occurred over the past two
years.
Consumer confidence edged down in December and again in January
according to both the Conference Board and the Michigan Survey
Research Center (SRC) indexes, as consumers' assessments of expected
business conditions continued to weaken. By contrast, according to
the SRC survey, consumers' appraisals of current buying conditions
for houses improved sharply in January, with respondents citing
lower interest rates as the main reason. The appraisals of buying
conditions for cars also strengthened relative to their weak autumn
readings, although buying conditions for household durables remained
depressed.
The demand for motor vehicles was uneven in December and
appeared to worsen in the first twenty days of January. In
December, sales of cars and light trucks held up at a 12.3 million
unit annual rate because a jump in sales of domestically produced

light trucks offset lower sales of cars. This year-end surge of
light truck sales reflected intense competition between Ford and GM,
who enhanced their sales incentives in an effort to raise their
market share and become the nation's number one truck maker in 1991.
However, a payback occurred in the first twenty days of January as
sales of domestically produced light trucks dropped substantially.
Sales of domestically produced passenger cars appeared to weaken
further in early January; on average, sales in December and thus far
in January came in at a 5.85 million unit pace, weaker than in the
fourth quarter as a whole.

Widespread declines in nominal retail sales occurred in the
fourth quarter of last year. In the retail control category, which
excludes spending at automotive dealers and at building material and
supply stores, sales fell, on average, 0.2 percent per month. The
largest absolute reduction in sales during this three-month period
was at general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliance
stores; expenditures on items at these stores were lacklusters made in

earlier in 1991 as well. By contrast, relatively small gains over
the final three months of 1991 were posted in sales of "other
durable goods."l
Given the weakness in retail sales and motor vehicles sales,
the goods component of real personal consumption expenditures is
estimated by the BEA to have declined 5.2 percent at an annual rate
in the fourth quarter. However, real personal consumption
expenditures on services rose at a 2.3 percent annual rate; in
total, real personal consumption expenditures declined 1.1 percent
at an annual rate in the fourth quarter.
Business Fixed Investment
According to BEA's advance estimate, real business fixed
investment fell 2.4 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter,
as another sharp drop in nonresidential construction was offset by a
small rise in spending on equipment. On the equipment side, a
40 percent jump in real spending for computers was offset by a
collapse in aircraft investment. The surge in computer spending
largely reflected the initial deliveries of a new generation of IBM
mainframes, while an extraordinary drop in the share of aircraft
deliveries to domestic airlines pushed aircraft investment down to
its lowest level since the middle of 1984. Real outlays for
nonresidential structures were estimated by BEA to have fallen at a
9.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter--led by another
double-digit decline in commercial construction.
Looking ahead, it appears likely that near-term growth in
equipment outlays will be modest. Equipment investment tends to lag
overall economic activity; thus, the early recovery last spring was
followed by a brief resurgence in investment last fall, and the
recent deceleration of economic activity likely will damp investment

goods, sporting goods, books, jewelry, and cameras.

during the first half of this year. Indeed, in the fourth quarter,
(nominal) orders for nondefense capital goods (excluding aircraft
and computers) edged up only 0.1 percent from the third-quarter
level and point to little change in shipments during the current
quarter. Moreover, new orders from domestic carriers for Boeing
jetliners have plummeted since midyear. Although Boeing's backlog
of domestic aircraft orders is still quite high and new orders are
filled with a long lag, the current climate suggests that, even
after a rebound from the low fourth quarter, spending is likely to
remain cautious. Finally, a slowing in the growth of computer
purchases has followed quickly on the heels of the early fourth-
quarter surge at IBM, with computer shipments dropping 10 percent in
December.
Indicators for nonresidential structures continue to paint a
bleak picture. Total construction contracts have not deviated from
the steep downward trend that began in late 1989 (chart).
Commercial construction has borne the brunt of this decline, as the
persistent oversupply of existing space continues to depress
property values and curtail new construction. Appraised values of
office properties trended down further in the third quarter of 1991
(chart) and have declined nearly 30 percent since 1985.2 For the
other commercial sector, which comprises primarily retail and
warehouse properties, values have been dropping steadily since 1989.
Business Inventories
Business inventories began to rise noticeably last fall after
months of substantial liquidation earlier in the year. Total
manufacturing and trade inventories expanded at a $30.7 billion
annual rate (current cost) from September to November, with the

runup concentrated at retail and wholesale outlets. Coming at a
time of sluggish sales, the stockbuilding has caused some
deterioration in trade inventory-sales ratios and points to the
possibility of paring in the coming months.
Among the major sectors, manufacturing inventories at present
are the leanest. Although slowing shipments in October and November
led to some buildup in stocks of finished goods, especially in the
motor vehicle, chemical, and paper industries, manufacturers were
able to reduce their holdings of production materials and work-in-
process inventories. As a result, except for a brief upsurge in
September, manufacturing inventories, on net, have continued the
downtrend that began in December of 1990.
Wholesale inventories expanded sharply in October and November,
rising at an average pace of $17-1/2 billion. A sizable part of the
accumulation was in nonconsumer goods such as machinery, building
materials, chemicals, and farm products. For most types of
wholesale distributors, inventory-sales ratios have moved up in
recent months, but have remained well below their recent peaks
posted last winter.
Outside of motor vehicles, retail inventories continued to
build through November, and the inventory-sales ratios of most types
of non-auto retailers, particularly that for the GAF grouping, have
been moving up since late summer. However, the pace of accumulation
appears to have slowed. Non-auto retail establishments reported an
$8 billion (current-cost, annual rate) buildup in November, less
than half of the $18.3 billion average pace reported in the previous
two months.
Housing Markets
Production and sales of homes continued to expand through year-

sales. Total housing starts rose 2.6 percent in December to
1.10 million units at an annual rate, because of an increase in
single-family home construction. For 1991 as a whole, however,
starts totaled only 1.01 million units, the lowest annual average in
the postwar era.
In the single-family sector, starts increased 4.2 percent in
December, as continued declines in mortgage interest rates further
pared the cash flow burden of home purchases. Also, starts for
November were revised upward by 20,000 units. Permit issuance for
single-family homes rose nearly 7 percent in December,
substantiating the increase in building activity. Sales of existing
homes edged up about 1 percent in December to 3.34 million units,
the highest level since last June. New home sales in November were
unchanged after a moderate increase in October. However, sales in
the Northeast plummeted an inexplicably large 45 percent in
November. The sharp decline in new home sales is in marked contrast
to strong December increases in both total housing starts and
existing home sales in the Northeast. This evidence suggests that
the national estimate of new home sales may bounce back in
December--or that the November figure may be revised upward.
The early indications are that housing demand strengthened in
January. According to preliminary data, consumer attitudes toward
homebuying improved sharply (chart). Furthermore, builders' rating
of new home sales turned more positive in January, suggesting that
some households were acting upon the improvement in homebuying
attitudes (chart). Most prominent among the reasons given by
consumers with a favorable view of homebuying conditions in early
January was the low level of interest rates. Conceivably, the very
recent mortgage rate backup may tip the balance for some potential
buyers even further in favor of purchasing now instead of waiting
for further rate declines.

Multifamily housing starts dropped to 155,000 units at an
annual rate in December, a level just above the series low set last
May. Multifamily starts averaged 173,000 units for the year, the
lowest since the 1950s. Multifamily housing production continues to
be hampered by the persistence of very high vacancy rates on
apartment units and the resulting restraint on rents. After
accounting for seasonal patterns, the multifamily vacancy rate
continued to edge up in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Federal Sector
In the fourth quarter of 1991, the unified budget deficit
totaled $83 billion (not at an annual rate), a bit less than its
level of a year earlier. That figure is deceptive, however: If
outlays for deposit insurance (DI) and contributions to the defense
cooperation account (DCA) are excluded, the fourth-quarter deficit
was up $15.5 billion from its year-ago level. (With the recent
approval of a $25 billion appropriation for the RTC, which is
projected to satisfy RTC needs through the end of March, outlays for
deposit insurance are expected to rise substantially in the current
quarter.) Outlays were boosted in the fourth quarter by continued
sizable growth in spending on social security, income security, and
medicare and health. Revenues were up only about 2 percent relative
to a year earlier, as increases in social insurance and excise taxes
(boosted by legislation enacted in late 1990) were offset by
weakness in personal and corporate income taxes associated with the
weakness in economic activity.
The CBO released its economic and budget outlook on January 23.
CBO's baseline estimates show the federal budget deficit rising
$83 billion to $352 billion in FY1992, and then declining steadily
through FY1995 as economic activity strengthens, outlays for deposit
insurance decline, and spending reductions mandated by the 1990
Budget Enforcement Act take effect. After FY1995, the deficit is

projected to begin an upward drift in response to increased
entitlement spending. Relative to CBO's August projections, the
forecast for the deficit excluding DI and DCA has been adjusted up
in FY1992 and FY1993 about $40 billion, reflecting lower receipts
estimates attributable to slower income growth and lower capital
gains realizations than were forecast in August.
CBO's projections assume adherence to the 1990 Budget
Enforcement Act, which for FY1993 requires that discretionary
defense and domestic outlays be cut $12 billion and $9 billion
respectively from their FY1992 levels. For fiscal years 1994 and
1995, the spending caps apply to total discretionary spending, which
is slated to fall $7 billion in FY1994 and then remain flat in
FY1995.
CBO now projects that deposit insurance outlays in fiscal years
1992 and 1993 will remain essentially unchanged from their FY1991
level. Over the next five fiscal years, the undiscounted total of
projected deposit insurance outlays is essentially unchanged
relative to CBO's August projections, as higher projected spending
on the Bank Insurance Fund about offsets $30 billion of projected
RTC spending that has been pushed beyond the forecast horizon.
The Administration released its FY1993 budget Wednesday
morning. OMB now expects the federal deficit to approach $400
billion in FY1992, before dropping to about $350 billion in FY1993.
The FY1992 deficit projection is up about $50 billion relative to
OMB's July mid-session budget review estimate, primarily because of
the effect on revenues of weaker income assumptions and lower
technical effective tax rate estimates. These same factors, in
addition to higher projections for deposit insurance and medicaid
outlays, have pushed OMB's FY1993 deficit up about $100 billion
relative to the level estimated in July.

Fiscal years

The budget includes proposals to (1) exclude up to 45 percent
of capital gains from tax, the portion depending on the holding
period, (2) accelerate depreciation allowances for equipment
acquired in the remainder of CY1992, (3) make the 20 percent tax
credit for incremental R&D expenditures permanent, (4) create
flexible individual retirement accounts for low- and middle-income
taxpayers, (5) waive the penalty for early IRA withdrawals for the
purchase of a first home and for medical and educational expenses,
(6) grant a 10 percent tax credit (capped at $5,000) on a first home
purchase transacted during the remainder of CY1992, (7) increase the
exemption for dependent children by $500, and (8) cut defense
spending by $50 billion over the next five fiscal years. In
addition, the budget reports that the President has taken action to
permanently reduce withholding taxes by about 5 percent beginning in
March 1992, thereby reducing individual taxes by a projected $21
billion in CY1992. Because a decrease in withholding results in
increased net final payments the following year, this change leaves
revenues in future years approximately unchanged.
State and Local Government Sector
The state and local government sector remains under budgetary
pressure. Real purchases of goods and services were essentially
unchanged in the fourth quarter, and were down 1/2 percent over 1991
as a whole. The slowing in purchases follows several years of
sizable increases; in fact, 1983 was the last year to show a gain
much below 3 percent. Among the major components of spending, real
construction outlays continued to advance in the fourth quarter, but
compensation was essentially unchanged and purchases of other goods
and services fell.
Anecdotal reports and a national survey indicate that state and
local governments are continuing to experience grave fiscal
conditions, and another round of budget-balancing measures can be

expected. According to a December survey by the National
Association of State Legislatures, about thirty states are expecting
revenues--notably sales tax receipts--for FY1992 to come in below
target, and a similar number are experiencing expenditure overruns,
especially for medicaid (chart). Moreover, many of these states
have relatively low reserves in their general and rainy-day funds.
Spending cuts are anticipated to be the most frequently used budget
remedy this year; a few state legislatures reduced outlays during
special sessions held in late 1991, and governors in several states
have ordered cuts. Officials are looking to eliminate and
reorganize programs; for example, Michigan, California, and New
Jersey are revamping their medicaid and welfare programs. In
addition, many states are likely to lay off or furlough employees
and to reduce aid to local governments. So far, only a few states,
notably Maryland and Florida, are considering hikes in taxes;
efforts to roll back recent tax increases in Connecticut and New
Jersey failed.
Labor Costs
The incoming data on labor costs suggest that the rate of
increase in wages continues to trend downward. The employment cost
index for hourly compensation in private industry rose 4.0 percent
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter, and
for 1991 as a whole, compensation costs were up 4.4 percent, only a
little less than in 1990. This gradual deceleration was seen in the
wages and salaries component and in the benefits component, both of
which came down about 1/4 percentage point from their 1990 increase.
By industry, the deceleration in 1991 was evident in both the
goods-producing and service-producing sectors. By occupation,
however, the slowing was most pronounced for white-collar workers.
Hourly compensation for this group of workers decelerated about
1/2 percentage point from its 1990 pace. In contrast, compensation

gains for blue-collar and service workers were about the same in
1991 as in 1990.
By bargaining status, the deceleration in hourly compensation
was most marked for nonunion workers; in contrast, union
compensation gains were a bit higher in 1991 than in 1990. Data on
major collective bargaining agreements from the BLS indicate that
the overall wage change in contracts covering 1,000 or more workers
remained about the same in 1991 as in 1990. However, average first-
year adjustments slowed from 4 percent in 1990 to 3.6 percent in
1991, and the contribution to total union wage inflation from new
settlements was smaller last year. (The contribution from deferred
increases under existing contracts was somewhat greater.) Data from
Bureau of National Affairs (BNA; a private publishing company) on
settlements covering fifty or more workers also point to some
slowing in first-year wage adjustments, although not as much as in
the BLS data. After factoring in lump-sum provisions, the BNA
series estimates median first-year settlements at 4.0 percent in
1991, down from the 4.3 percent average increase negotiated in 1990.
Prices
The consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in December, while
the producer price index--held down by declines for food and
energy--fell 0.2 percent. Excluding food and energy items, these
measures registered moderate increases of 0.3 percent and
0.2 percent respectively. On a twelve-month basis, aggregate
inflation rates slowed sharply from their elevated pace in 1990,
reflecting the swing in energy prices, a marked deceleration for
food, and continued slack in labor and product markets. The CPI
rose only 3.1 percent in 1991, half the increase in the preceding
year, while the PPI edged down.
Food prices toward year-end continued to reflect volatility in
the prices of fruits and vegetables. The rise in the CPI for food

slowed to 0.3 percent in December, as price increases for fruits and
vegetables were down sharply after their November climb. Over the
year, CPI for food rose only about 2 percent, after three years of
increases in the 5 to 5-1/2 percent range. In large part, this
slowing owed to a decline in meat prices; but even excluding
livestock products and fruits and vegetables (about 30 percent of
CPI for food), average food price increases slowed nearly
2 percentage points from their 1990 pace. The rise for food away
from home was the smallest in more than twenty-five years, likely
reflecting soft demand, slowing in labor costs, and reduced prices
for inputs of food products.
The CPI for energy rose 0.4 percent in December, less than in
November, as prices dropped back for heating oil and natural gas.
However, electricity rates turned up. More recent information
points to a marked near-term decline in prices of petroleum
products. Private survey data for January indicate lower prices of
gasoline at both the wholesale and retail levels. Moreover,
wholesale prices for heating oil were down sharply as of mid-
January. The recent steep declines in prices of heating oil likely
reflect the high inventory levels, in part as a result of relatively
warm weather during the fourth quarter, and lower crude oil costs.
Excluding food and energy, goods prices edged down in the
December CPI. Apparel prices fell 0.6 percent, mainly reflecting a
large decline for jewelry, while prices of new vehicles were little
changed. The index for tobacco products posted another large
increase, but prices declined for a second month for house
furnishings and recreational goods. In contrast to goods, the rise
in prices of nonenergy services picked up to 0.5 percent in
December, boosted by large increases for airfares and lodging out of
town.

On a year-over-year basis (table), deceleration was evident
last year in the underlying measures of inflation, reflecting
continued slack in product and labor markets (and the associated
slowing in compensation), smaller increases in import prices, and
markedly lower inflation expectations. However, the pattern of
deceleration was uneven. The CPI excluding food and energy rose
4.4 percent in 1991, 3/4 percentage point less than in the preceding
year; services more than accounted for this slowing. Rent increases
eased markedly last year as a result of the weakness in housing
markets, and auto financing costs fell 7 percent as interest rates
declined. Despite the year-end pickup, airline fares registered a
net decline of 6 percent--after a surge in 1990--in response to the
dropback in fuel costs after the Gulf War as well as sluggish
demand. Prices for medical care and several labor-intensive
services also rose less than in 1990 (not shown).
In contrast to services, the CPI for goods other than food and
energy rose more in 1991 than in 1990--4 percent compared with
3.4 percent. About half of the pickup can be attributed to higher
excise taxes, mainly the hike in federal taxes early last year on
alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and luxury cars. A swing in prices
of used cars, which declined in 1990, can account for the remainder
of this acceleration. The prices of new vehicles were up
3.2 percent in 1991, compared with an increase of 2 percent in 1990.
However, there was a marked slowing for some other goods, notably
apparel. This pattern--acceleration for cars and slowing for other
consumer goods--also is evident in import prices (lower part of
table).
At the producer level, the PPI for finished goods less food and
energy rose 3.1 percent last year, 0.4 percentage point less than in
1990. Deceleration was limited for consumer goods but notable for
capital equipment excluding motor vehicles; prices of imported

capital goods slowed even more sharply. At earlier stages of
processing, in which labor costs tend to have a smaller effect,
prices of intermediate materials (nonfood, nonenergy) receded
0.8 percent last year--affected by sluggish activity in the
industrial sector and the pass-through of the climb and subsequent
dropback of petroleum-based materials costs associated with the Gulf
War. The PPI for crude materials less food and energy fell
8 percent last year, in large part reflecting declines for scrap
metals, as industrial demand weakened and metal supplies remained
ample.
More recently, there are signs that some commodity prices may
be bottoming out. Aluminum prices have picked up markedly from
their recent low levels, and large increases also were posted this
month for lumber, plywood, and silver. The Journal of Commerce
index of industrial prices has turned up in the past few weeks,
largely reflecting the increases for aluminum and plywood; on net,
since the week of the last Greenbook, the index total moved up about
1 percent and the metals component 1-3/4 percent. In contrast, the
CRB spot industrials index has continued to decline, reflecting
weakness in the prices of steel scrap and cotton. The CRB futures
index, based mainly on foods and precious metals, turned up in
recent weeks but has registered little net change over the inter-
meeting period.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Treasury bill rates have declined about 25 basis points since
the December FOMC meeting, responding primarily to the larger than
expected easing action by the System near the end of the year.
Following the full percentage point cut in the discount rate, major
banks slashed their prime rate by 1 percentage point, to 6-1/2
percent. The federal funds rate decreased 1/2 percentage point in
association with the discount rate move, and most other private
money market rates have declined 1/4 to 3/4 percentage points.
Yields on Treasury securities and fixed-rate mortgages fell sharply
early in the intermeeting period, although subsequently most long-
term yields have retraced those declines, as the market's
expectation for additional near-term easing has diminished and
prospects for a fiscal stimulus package have increased.
Equity market indexes are up 7 to 14 percent over the
intermeeting period; the major indexes set record highs in early
January, reflecting lower interest rates and growing optimism about
future corporate earnings. Cyclical stocks posted significant
gains, while bank stocks benefited from lower interest rates and the
more positive tone of the industry's fourth-quarter earnings
reports.
Growth of M2 and M3 slowed further on average in January,
although both aggregates strengthened in mid-month after a period of
unusual weakness around year-end. The nontransactions component of
M2 declined and large time deposits fell sharply. M3 money funds
also weakened considerably from a brisk fourth-quarter pace. Bank
credit growth slowed in December, as loans posted a small decline.
and early data for January point to anemic growth this month.

III-3
In response to low interest rates and high stock prices,
nonfinancial corporations issued long-term bonds and shares in near
record volumes. Public bond offerings soared in January to the
second largest monthly level ever; proceeds are targeted in many
cases for the repayment of short-term debt or callable bonds. Much
of the equity issuance has been by firms seeking to reduce debt and
strengthen balance sheets, and it continues to include a substantial
number of reverse LBOs. Commercial paper dropped slightly in
December but increased again in January, and bank business loans
declined in both months. In the household sector, increased housing
activity near the end of the year and growth in real estate loans at
banks suggest some recovery in net mortgage borrowing in the fourth
quarter, while mortgage refinancing activity has soared. Consumer
credit growth showed signs of firming in December following no
change in November.
Net borrowing by the federal government declined in the fourth
quarter on a not-seasonally-adjusted basis, and is expected to fall
somewhat further in the first quarter. After raising significant
funds in November and December, state and local governments borrowed
much less in January. Borrowing by the sector is expected to
accelerate, however, as the calendar for new municipal bonds has
begun to build.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Creditl
M2 grew at a 3-1/4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter,
leaving its fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter growth in 1991 at
3 percent--somewhat above the lower bound of its target range. M3
grew at a 1-1/4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter and over
1. The monetary data in this document incorporate benchmarks and
updates to seasonal adjustment factors that should be treated as
confidential until their public release, tentatively scheduled for
February 13, 1992.

1991 as a whole, also a bit above the lower bound of its target
range. M2 and M3 continued to expand sluggishly in January.
M1 growth accelerated significantly in January, propelled by
higher growth rates in all three of its major components. By
contrast, the nontransactions component of M2 declined at a
2 percent rate in January, after two months of slight gains. After
a small increase in December, M2 money funds contracted again in
January, largely reflecting declines around year-end. Runoffs of
small time deposits, which had occurred throughout 1991, picked up
this month, as interest rates offered on these deposits fell roughly
in line with market yields. A substantial portion of these time
deposit outflows evidently was shifted to savings deposits
(including MMDAs), which have accelerated sharply in January.
M2 growth would have been stronger were it not for recent sharp
cuts in rates paid on OCDs and on savings deposits. Rates on NOW
accounts and on total savings accounts (including MMDAs) fell by
more than 1/2 percentage point between October and December. Since
mid-December, NOW account rates at commercial banks have tumbled
65 to 75 basis points to an average of just over 3 percent, while
rates on MMDAs have dropped another 60 basis points. The reductions
in total savings deposit rates, which have brought them more in line
with retail CD rates (chart), may have been motivated in part by a
desire to limit internal shifts of funds. Conversations with senior
bank financial officers indicate most banks are not concerned that
lower rates on savings deposits will result in a significant loss of
these funds; in the past, longstanding savings account customers
have not been sensitive to changes in relative interest rates.
The non-M2 portion of M3 declined at a 10 percent annual rate
in January. The decline in large time deposits (net of money fund
holdings) accelerated to nearly a 30 percent annual rate, and

institution-only money market funds contributed less strength. M3
money funds grew at a 20 percent annual pace in January, after
several months of very rapid increases spurred by a widening gap
between their own yields and Treasury rates. However, money fund
balances plunged around year-end, in part as institutions
temporarily shifted funds into short-term money market instruments
to take advantage of an anticipated year-end spike in rates. In
addition, some institutional holders reportedly moved funds into the
stock market so that on their annual financial statements they would
appear to be more heavily invested in equities. The end-of-year
decline was more than recovered by a rebound in subsequent weeks.
Bank credit growth slowed in December to a 4-3/4 percent rate,
a touch stronger than its 3-1/4 percent advance for the year as a
whole. As previously in 1991, bank credit growth in December was
due primarily to acquisitions of U.S. government securities, which
offset declines in total loans. Business loans weakened further in
December and declined 4 percent for the year as a whole, in part a
result of an extraordinary pace of longer-term debt and equity
issuance by nonfinancial firms looking to strengthen their balance
sheets. January data from the Survey of the Terms of Bank Lending
show that only a few respondents indicated any further tightening in
standards for approval of loan applications or the terms of business
loans. Respondents characterized recent loan demand as having
weakened for firms of all sizes.
Real estate loans edged up in December and expanded in 1991 by
only 2 percent, the slowest rate in at least three decades, despite
a nearly 14 percent increase last year in home equity loans.
Reflecting an increase in consumer lending and a slower pace of
securitization, consumer loans on commercial bank balance sheets,
for the first time since last February, did not decline. For the

III-8
year, consumer loans contracted but managed a small gain when
adjusted for estimated securitization. Security loans advanced
briskly again in December, continuing a pattern of stronger growth
that began in July, likely as a result of increased security
positions during the rally in equity and bond markets. Partial data
suggest bank credit growth slowed further in January. Securities
acquisitions decelerated and, aside from security loans, growth of
the loan components remained sluggish.
Some evidence suggests that weak credit demand and restraint on
bank credit also were evident in off-balance-sheet items in 1991
(table). For example, considerable weakness in commercial real
estate through the third quarter was accompanied by a 40 percent
drop in credit lines for this type of loan, as banks aggressively
tightened loan approval standards. Similarly, unused lines for

commercial and industrial (C&I) loans apparently also declined along
with outstanding balances. On the other hand, growth in loans taken
down under home equity lines of credit was about matched in the
growth of unused lines, at least through the third quarter. The
surge in available credit card lines may indicate continued
aggressive marketing of credit cards by banks.

III-9
Business Finance
Over the intermeeting period, financing by nonfinancial firms
continued to be dominated by balance sheet restructuring. In
response to lower interest rates and higher stock prices, firms
issued long-term bonds and equity at near record levels. Reflecting
this substitution into longer maturity financing, commercial paper
declined slightly in December and increased only modestly in
January, while bank loans in December ran off at a 6 percent annual
rate and in January apparently declined slightly again. Overall,
borrowing by nonfinancial firms probably weakened somewhat in
December, but firmed in January as a result of strong bond issuance.
Public bond offerings exploded in January, sparked by the drop
in long-term rates following the discount rate cut in December.
Total gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms in January could
reach $16 billion, the second largest monthly issuance after the
record of April 1986. Most of January's volume has been in the form
of large offerings of non-callable bonds issued by investment-grade
firms, including a number of utilities. Despite the heavy issuance,
yield spreads on investment-grade bonds have remained relatively
narrow. The favorable conditions for bond issuance currently appear
to extend at least into the higher grades of the junk bond market,
where spreads have narrowed somewhat since the last FOMC meeting.
Although still light relative to a few years ago, junk issuance in
December continued to show some strength; offerings in the final two
months of the year constituted almost 40 percent of total offerings
for 1991. Currently, the market appears receptive to BB-rated
issuers and to certain B-rated issuers.
A desire to refinance more expensive debt at lower interest
rates has spurred much of the recent public bond issuance. Of the

$38 billion of investment-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds that
will become callable in 1992, call options on around $25 billion of
these bonds are "in the money" at current interest rate levels and
likely will be exercised. To this end, firms already have announced
calls this year on $10 billion of outstanding issues.
Conversations with participants in the private placement market
suggest that much of the borrowing activity over the last half of
1991 was to refinance short-term bank loans. In addition to locking
in low long-term rates, many borrowers at weaker banks reportedly
are concerned that their lines of credit may not be renewed.
Fueled by rising stock prices, equity issuance by nonfinancial
firms continued at a very strong pace over the intermeeting period.
December issuance totaled more than $5-1/2 billion, bringing the
fourth-quarter total to a record $18 billion. As in the bond
market, much of the equity issuance has been by firms attempting to
raise funds to strengthen balance sheets, and it continues to
include a healthy number of reverse LBOs. December's issuance
included reverse LBOs, each more than $500 million, by Owens-
Illinois and HealthTrust, Inc. In both cases, proceeds were used to
retire outstanding high-yield bonds. In addition, Goodyear,
Tenneco, The Marriott Corporation, and International Paper issued a
combined $1.5 billion of equity in December and January, devoted
primarily toward debt retirement. Plans for additional initial
public offerings (IPOs) have been filed by a large number of
companies, and numerous reverse LBOs are on the calendar. Foremost
among them is Burlington Industries' plan for an $850 million
offering, which, combined with a new bank line, would be used to
retire outstanding junk bonds.
The restructuring of balance sheets by nonfinancial firms is
beginning to show through to some measures of corporate financial

III-12
health. According to staff estimates, gross interest payments by
nonfinancial firms as a share of cash flow have declined to less
than 36 percent in the fourth quarter of 1991 from more than
39 percent a year earlier (chart). The level of gross interest
payments itself appears to have peaked in the first quarter of 1990;
since then, it has fallen roughly $60 billion, or almost 20 percent.
Bond rating changes suggest that financial restructuring also
is paying off in credit evaluations. According to Moody's,
downgrades among nonfinancial firms fell slightly from the third
quarter and were well below the levels of last winter and spring.
Upgrades increased from the third quarter. Many of the upgrades
have stemmed from equity issuance or debt retirement, as well as

actual or expected improvement in operating earnings. The most
prominent upgrade of the quarter was RJR Nabisco, which returned to
investment-grade status after successfully restructuring its balance
sheet through a series of large equity offerings and substantial
high-yield debt retirements.
Reflecting lower interest rates and growing optimism about the
economic outlook, stock prices are up between 7 and 14 percent since
the December FOMC meeting, with the major indexes setting record
highs. Over-the-counter stocks have performed especially well, with
trading activity on NASDAQ often exceeding that on the NYSE. Bank
stocks, benefiting from lower interest rates and the more positive
tone of the sectors' fourth-quarter earnings reports, were up more
than 15 percent over the intermeeting period. "Cyclical" stocks
also have posted significant gains. Reflecting the high level of
the major stock indexes, the S&P 500 price-earnings ratio currently
is at an all-time high of 23.6, while the S&P dividend-price ratio
is at its lowest level since October 1987. Some market analysts are
suggesting that corporate earnings will rebound sharply in 1992
after extraordinary chargeoffs in 1991.
Satisfying a regulatory requirement for approval of its
proposed merger with Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical Bank in late
January took advantage of the rise in stock prices and issued almost
$1.6 billion in common stock. As part of its successful merger with
Security Pacific, BankAmerica in December issued $300 million in
preferred stock and announced plans to issue another $300 million
early in 1992.
Stock prices of the major life insurance companies rose less
than 4 percent over the intermeeting period, reflecting evidence of
continued financial problems. Prudential announced plans to cut its
1992 dividend to policyholders by about 7 percent, citing lower

III-14
interest rates and weak real estate markets. The announcement
followed dividend cuts by Metropolitan and Mutual Benefit in the
fourth quarter. In addition. Prudential was downgraded by Moody's
in January from Aaa to Aal, primarily reflecting Moody's concerns
about Prudential's commercial real estate portfolio and its above-
average holdings of high-yield securities. Another top-twenty life
insurance company, Nationwide, also was downgraded from Aaa to Aal
in January.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff expects a first-quarter federal deficit of
$127 billion, financed by $80 billion of marketable borrowing and a
substantial drawdown in the cash balance. Although first-quarter
marketable borrowing is projected to be about unchanged from the
fourth-quarter level, gross auction sizes will have to be increased
to repay a bulge in maturing debt. The staff anticipates that
weekly bill auctions will be raised to $22 billion, from the current
level of $20.8 billion, and that coupon auctions will be raised
between $250 million and $1.25 billion. A large cash management
bill likely will be needed in early March to bridge seasonal
declines in the cash balance before tax inflows in mid-April. The
Treasury recently stated that it is considering cutting back on
thirty-year bond auctions and shifting its borrowing toward shorter
maturities. Such a move would attempt both to lower borrowing costs
by taking advantage of the unusual steepness of the Treasury yield
curve, and to stimulate the economy by lowering long-term interest
rates.
In the market for government sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt,
spreads remain tight by historical standards as the total debt
outstanding continued to hover near the peak established in

mid-1989. A number of GSEs recently issued new debt on a
competitive-bid basis, rather than through their regular syndication
process. The issues typically are in the $100 million to
$300 million range. The bidding by dealers is reported to have been
quite aggressive, with some looking to enhance their overall bond
sales standings. Indeed, some issues have been purchased at yields
10 basis points below comparable-maturity Treasury securities.
In January, the Securities and Exchange Commission imposed
fines on ninety-eight banks and broker-dealers that admitted to
overstating customer interest in GSE debt offerings. The fines,
which ranged from $5,000 to $100,000 and totaled $5 million, were
based on the amount of business conducted with the GSEs rather than
on the level of infractions. Salomon Brothers, whose admissions of
wrongdoing led to the SEC investigation, did not participate in the
settlement.
In late January, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the SEC
released their joint study of the government securities market,
undertaken in response to the Salomon Brothers scandal. The study
recommends more vigilant enforcement of auction rules, enhanced
surveillance of market rate movements to discern market
manipulation, and reopenings of outstanding securities to offset
unusually severe market shortages. Such reopenings are expected to
reduce the need for added reporting or other restrictions to impede
market manipulation. The study also supports accelerated auction
automation and experimentation with alternative auction formats to
broaden bidder participation, lessen the threat of manipulation,
and, perhaps, provide cost savings to the Treasury. However,
underwriting premiums at recent Treasury coupon auctions have been
very slim, suggesting that bidding currently is extremely aggressive
and that potential cost savings from alternative auction formats

III-17
would be relatively small. For the sixty-six coupon auctions from
January 1990 to September 1991, the average markup of the auction-
average rate over the rate at which investors could have purchased
the same security in the when-issued market at the time of auction
was only 3/4 of a basis point, according to staff estimates. With
regard to GSEs, the study recommended that their equity and
unsecured debt securities not be exempt from federal securities laws
and that they be required to register those securities with the SEC.
Municipal Securities
After heavy issuance in November and December, long-term
municipal bond sales declined in January, but nonetheless remained
strong. With long-term municipal bond yields near twelve-year lows,
refunding issuance also remains strong. The forward calendar has
begun to build again, pointing to a pickup in new offerings in
coming weeks.
For 1991 as a whole, gross issuance of long- and short-term
debt jumped 30 percent to about $204 billion, the second highest
annual total ever. Reflecting widespread budget problems, short-
term issuance surged to a record level of nearly $45 billion.
Moreover, as many financially strapped state and local governments
turned to funding capital expenditures with bond proceeds rather
than tax revenues, long-term issuance surged 28 percent. In
response to lower interest rates, refunding volume also picked up.
Changes in long-term debt ratings in 1991 present a mixed
picture of the overall direction of credit quality in the municipal
sector. Upgrades by Moody's Investors Service exceeded downgrades
by a 2-to-1 margin. Moody's tends to give considerable weight to
the long-term prospects of issuers, and, as a result, its rating
changes are not very sensitive to cyclical changes in financial
conditions. In contrast, Standard & Poor's rating changes seem more

in line with the near-term cyclical financial difficulties of
issuers. Based on preliminary figures, a total of $53 billion of
municipal debt was downgraded by Standard & Poor's, compared with
$8 billion upgraded. Downgrades by Standard & Poor's exceeded
upgrades by a more than 4-to-1 margin. General obligation issues
bore the brunt of Standard & Poor's downgrades. Ratings on more
than $33 billion of general obligation debt were lowered in 1991,
2including that of eight states. Analysts at Standard & Poor's
emphasize that although credit quality eroded in 1991, it remains
relatively high for the sector as a whole. For example, of the
forty-one states rated by Standard & Poor's, twenty-six are rated AA
or better and only one is rated lower than A-.
Standard & Poor's largest downgrade occurred in mid-December,
when it cut the rating of the State of California to AA from AAA,
affecting approximately $15 billion of state debt. The credit
agency cited two consecutive years of operating deficits as the
primary cause of the downgrade. The deficits resulted from rising

Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont were downgraded during the

social service costs and reduced tax receipts; they led to
elimination of budget reserves and to sharp tax increases last July.
The credit agency expressed concern that the unpopularity of the tax
increases would hamper the ability of the state to take further
prompt action to correct the state's widening budget gap. A recent
projection by the state indicates that California faces a
$2.2 billion deficit in the current fiscal year. Market
participants were not surprised by California's downgrade; however,
they had thought it unlikely that California would drop below AA+.
Nevertheless, secondary market yield spreads on California issues
have widened only about 10 basis points since the downgrade.
Standard & Poor's joined with Moody's in lowering ratings of
New York State issues in early January. Standard & Poor's dropped
the rating on the state's general obligation debt from A to A-.
Moody's action was less dramatic; the credit agency reduced the
rating of New York State appropriation debt--revenue debt backed by
leases--from A to Baal and placed the state's general obligation
debt on review for a possible downgrade. Both credit agencies cited
the state's inability to formulate a plan to close the 1992 budget
gap, now estimated at $938 million, without resorting to borrowing.
The governor recently announced a package of $407 million of
spending cuts and $531 million of short-term note financing, thus
3marking the fourth consecutive year of deficit financing. For
the 1993 fiscal year, which starts on April 1, the state faces an
estimated budget gap of $4.8 billion. Yield spreads on actively
traded New York State appropriation bonds have widened approximately
3. The accumulated general fund deficit stood at approximately
$6.2 billion at the beginning of the 1992 fiscal year, excluding
$800 million that was converted to long-term debt in the form of
Local Government Assistance Corporation bonds issued in fiscal year
1991.

30 basis points since the downgrades, while yield spreads on New
York State general obligation bond indexes have widened about
10 basis points.
Mortgage Markets
Despite a relatively weak housing market, residential mortgage
originations in 1991 reportedly topped $500 billion, a new high
(table). The growth of mortgage originations, combined with the
contraction of the thrift industry, contributed to record issuance
of mortgage-backed pass-through securities in 1991 of $320 billion,
exceeding the previous record of $269 billion set in 1986. More
impressive, new-issue collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)
soared to $195 billion, a 75 percent increase over new-issue volume
the previous year.

grew 21 percent to $207 billion. Only new-issue Ginnie Maes were
unchanged from the previous year at $64 billion, a relatively anemic
performance due in part to higher mortgage insurance premiums and
downpayment requirements on FHA mortgages (the bulk of GNMA pools)
that became effective in the middle of 1991. Prior to these
changes, mortgagors were allowed to finance up to 100 percent of
their closing costs and were required to pay only a one-time, up-
front mortgage insurance premium. Reflecting increased product
knowledge and investor preference for mortgage securities that
provide some measure of prepayment protection in an environment of
declining yields, nearly all new-issue conventional MBSs now are
repackaged in the form of CMOs.
The non-agency sector of the mortgage securities market issued
a record $49 billion in 1991, more than double the $24 billion
issued in 1990. Non-agency MBSs generally are collateralized by
higher-yielding, nonconforming mortgages that are not eligible for
purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. These securities receive
their credit enhancement in the form of letters of credit, private
mortgage pool insurance, cash reserve accounts, or various forms of
senior/subordinated structures. The Resolution Trust Corporation
was the largest issuer of private-label mortgage securities in 1991,
issuing $9.6 billion.
Over the intermeeting period, contract rates on thirty-year,
conventional, fixed-rate mortgages declined 25 basis points before
moving higher near the end of the period. Initial rates on
adjustable-rate mortgages followed a similar pattern, but remain
about 30 basis points lower than at the time of the last FOMC
meeting. In response to lower market rates, the ceiling rate on
VA-guaranteed loans was reduced 50 basis points to 8 percent.

III-22
Lower market rates continue to spur refinancings. The latest
Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly survey indicates that
applications for mortgage refinancing have nearly tripled since
weakening slightly during the year-end holiday period (chart).
Prepayments of high-rate mortgages also have soared. Prepayment
rates on 10 percent Fannie Mae MBSs rose from 12 percent in
September to 41 percent in December (SAAR). Consistent with the
usual time between application and closing, changes in mortgage
prepayment rates appear to lag by about two months changes in the
MBA refinancing index.
Conventional mortgage yield spreads to comparable-maturity
Treasury securities have widened about 30 basis points from a
relatively narrow 160 basis points last July (chart). Much of the
wider spread compensates investors for the increased refinancing
risk, as measured by the volatility of seven-year Treasury yields.
The investor faces the risk that, should long-term yields decline
further, principal must be reinvested at lower yields.
Nevertheless, mortgage yield spreads appear unlikely to repeat their
experience of 1986, when significant declines in market yields and
unprecedented mortgage refinancings caused mortgage spreads to widen
by up to 150 basis points. A larger secondary market, strong
investor demand, and the refinancing protection provided by some CMO
bonds should allow the market to handle the expected wave of
refinancings in a more orderly manner.
Significant rates of mortgage refinancing will help households
reduce total debt servicing burdens in 1992. The staff has
estimated household mortgage interest savings using data from
individual mortgage pools on the actual and projected refinancing

experience of securitized residential mortgage debt. Assuming
mortgage interest rates remain at year-end 1991 levels, total
interest savings on residential mortgage debt in 1992 from the
refinancing of fixed-rate mortgages and the resetting of adjustable-
rate mortgages are projected to be between $7 billion and
$10 billion. However, refinancing transactions will be distributed
throughout the year, increasing the annual rate of interest savings
at the end of 1992 to be between $10 billion and $14 billion.
Consumer Credit
Outstanding consumer installment credit in November was
unchanged from its October level (table). Revolving credit
continued to grow in November but at a slower pace than in October;
outstandings for auto and other consumer loans fell in November.
Total consumer credit (installment plus noninstallment) declined
again in November.
Over the eleven months from December 1990 to November 1991,
consumer installment credit fell at a 1/2 percent annual rate.
Should December prove to be anemic, which seems likely given weak
auto and retail sales, 1991 will be the first year since the end of
World War II in which installment credit contracted. The decline in
1991 outstandings was mainly in automobile loans, which were
strongly affected by dismal auto sales and, to a lesser extent, by
shifts to alternative means of financing such as home equity loans
or leases. Revolving credit, although it continued to grow,
probably posted its smallest annual increase since 1980, when credit
controls and a recession sharply curtailed consumer borrowing.
One consequence of this net repayment of consumer debt has been
a decline in the ratio of installment credit to disposable personal
income (chart; solid line). After reaching a peak of 18-1/2 percent

in 1989, the ratio had declined about 1-1/2 percentage points to
about 17 percent by late 1991. However, the ratio remains high
relative to cyclical experience over the past twenty years.
The ratio of outstanding debt to income, of course, overstates
the actual current claims of principal amortization and interest on
current earnings. Therefore, the dashed line on the chart presents
an estimate of the proportion of disposable personal income required
to service current debt levels. Mainly reflecting the lengthening
of debt maturities during the 1980s, this latter measure is
considerably lower than the outstanding ratio. To a lesser extent,
however, some of the difference also may be due to the increasing
proportion of revolving credit, which has relatively low minimum
monthly repayment requirements. Although this debt service ratioPercent

rose during the 1980s, it never quite reached the peak level of 1970
and now stands at about the same level recorded in 1979 and 1986.
Gross public issuance of consumer asset-backed securities in
1991 reached a record $37 billion, up from the previous record of
$34.5 billion recorded last year (table); the number of new issues
in 1991 remained unchanged at 70. Although credit card-backed
securities accounted for the largest dollar volume in 1991, the
$20.4 billion issued was down somewhat from 1990's record
$22 billion, reflecting concerns about the possible downgrade early
last year of several bank issues. Securities backed by auto loans
increased to $14.8 billion in 1991 as all three of the domestic
captive finance companies returned to the market; Chrysler Financial
was most active, with a new issue about every other month.
Overall, fourth-quarter activity was the slowest since 1988,
following the very high issuance volume of the third quarter--the
second highest in seven years. The issuance of new credit card
asset-backed securities (ABSs) slowed, particularly in December,
when retailers were completely absent from the market and banks
retreated after issuing $2.5 billion in November. The slow December
credit card market may have been due, in part, to the wider yield
spreads that resulted from the scare caused by Senate passage of a
proposed interest rate cap on credit cards. However, yield spreads
subsequently have narrowed and now are only slightly above the early
November levels.

Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened in September to $6.8
billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis) from a revised deficit
of $6.5 billion in August, as imports rose more than exports. Most
of the increase in imports in September was in consumer goods,
especially apparel and toys. Data for October will be released on
December 19.

In the third quarter, the trade deficit was larger than that
recorded in either of the two preceding quarters. Exports were at
about the same record level as in the second quarter, well above
levels in previous quarters (particularly machinery exports).
Imports in the third quarter were 5 percent above the
second-quarter level. Most of the increase was in consumer goods
and in automotive products from Canada and Japan. Imports of
consumer goods rose 10 percent with strong increases recorded in
apparel, TVs and VCRs, toys, and household appliances. Automotive
imports from Canada continued to rise steadily from the low recorded

in the first quarter as Big Three producers began shipping for the
new model year. The increase in automotive imports from Japan
partially reversed the sharp decline recorded in the second quarter
and reflected, in part, increased shipments of luxury cars. Imports
of computers continued to climb in the third quarter, reaching a new
high. Aside from computers, imports of machinery declined for the
third consecutive quarter.
The recent rise in imports appears to have been associated with
a large buildup in retail inventories, most notably in September.
Data on industrial production, retail inventories, and imports
suggest that more than three fourths of the increase in inventories
of apparel and miscellaneous non-durable goods (which include toys)
in September was imported goods. To the extent that these
inventories might now be viewed by retailers as excessive (given the
recent slowdown in economic activity), any inventory correction in
these categories is likely to be borne in large part by foreign
producers.
The value of oil imported in the third quarter was about the
same as recorded in the second quarter. The quantity of oil imports
remained near 8.2 mb/d as an increase in domestic consumption was
offset by a lower rate of stockbuilding. Weekly Department of

Energy data indicate that stocks were drawn down rapidly in October
(depressing imports), as market participants apparently expected

IV-4
prices to recede; this expectation was evidenced by a large discount
of long term futures relative to near-term futures over most of
October.
Spot oil prices have fallen almost $3 per barrel since late
October, likely reflecting strong production by OPEC coupled with
sluggish economic activity world wide. However, given past
increases in spot prices and shipping and contract lags, import
prices are likely to have increased through November.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of non-oil imports (as reported by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS)) rose 0.5 percent in October, the second
consecutive month of increase. These increases followed five months
of declining prices. The largest increase in October was in
automotive imports and reflected introduction of the new 1992 model
year vehicles. All other major categories of imports showed small
increases in prices with the exception of consumer goods, which
remained unchanged from September.
Prices of nonagricultural exports increased 0.2 percent in
October, with increases recorded in every major category. October
was the second consecutive month of increase, following seven months
of flat or falling prices. Prices of agricultural exports increased
3.5 percent in October, paced by an increase in the price of wheat.
National Income and Product Account fixed-weight prices will
not be available until December 20th. The fixed-weight prices for
the third quarter from the BLS showed a 3.2 percent decline in
prices of non-oil imports and a 1.8 percent decline in prices of
non-agricultural exports. Both non-oil imports and nonagricultural
exports showed the largest declines in the industrial supplies
category.

U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account balance fell from a surplus of $12.1
(SAAR) billion in the second quarter to a deficit of $41.8 billion
in the third quarter, as the balance on both trade and transfers
deteriorated. Net transfers declined by $36.3 billion (AR), largely
the result of a $28 billion (AR) reduction in cash grants from
coalition partners in Operation Desert Storm and the provision of
$11.6 billion (AR) in debt forgiveness to several countries,
including Poland. (Approximately $1.2 billion (AR) of these grants
was used to pay interest arrears, boosting portfolio receipts). Net
service receipts rose slightly with an increase in receipts from
foreigners traveling in the United States and a small gain in net
military transactions.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Banks and securities firms in the United States reported
substantial capital outflows in October, partially reversing the
inflows reported in the third quarter (line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table). These month-end data have swung
widely this year. Contributing to these swings have been sharp
movements in lending by securities firms to Bermuda and the
Netherlands Antilles to finance holdings of U.S. Treasury securities
by certain mutual funds.
There was a small net outflow of $4.1 billion on securities
transactions for the third quarter, which continued into October
(lines 2 plus 3). A major element was the continued robust level of
net purchases of foreign securities by U.S. residents ($13 billion
for the third quarter and $6.5 billion in October, line 2c). The
cumulative flow for the first three quarters has already surpassed
the previous annual record registered in 1990. Two-thirds of the
third quarter outflow was for net stock purchases, but in October
the share shifted heavily toward foreign bonds. In September and
October, a large share of the stock purchases was in Japan (a total
of $2.4 billion). In October, purchases of foreign bonds by U.S.
residents rose to $4.2 billion; they were primarily from the United
Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, from Canada.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds were substantial,
for both the third quarter and October (line 2a). By contrast,
foreign net purchases of U.S. stocks were small in the third quarter
and virtually zero in September and October (line 2b). Foreign net
purchases of Treasury obligations were also very small (line 3).
Foreign official reserves in the United States fell by $6.2
billion in September, limiting the overall increase in the third
quarter to $3.5 billion (line 4). For the quarter, substantial

increases were registered by Taiwan, Spain and Mexico, with
decreases in OPEC countries and Japan. In October, official
holdings rose an additional $6.3 billion, with major increases
reported for the United Kingdom, the BIS, and Taiwan.
Recently released data show virtually no capital inflow in the
third quarter for foreign direct investment in the United States
(line 7); although the second quarter inflow was revised upward, the
total inflow in 1991 through three quarters ($13.2 billion) is less
than half of the corresponding inflow last year ($32.7 billion).
Direct investment outflows were $5.9 billion in the third quarter
(line 6); given the cumulative outflow through three quarters ($19.6
billion), it is likely that, for the year, U.S. direct investment
abroad will outweigh foreign direct investment in the United States.
The statistical discrepancy for the third quarter was
essentially zero, and the discrepancy for the second quarter was
revised downward by over $13 billion to $8.5 billion (line 10).
More than half of the revision was the result of the correction of a
reporting error, where a bank had reported its customers' claims in
lira rather than dollars.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign-exchange value of the dollar, in
terms of the other G-10 currencies, has been highly volatile, rising
nearly 2 percent on balance since the December 17 FOMC meeting, as
shown in the accompanying chart. The dollar has risen more than 2-
1/2 percent against the German mark, amid expectations that U.S.
interest rates have hit bottom and that German interest rates may
have passed their peak. The dollar has declined more than 2 percent
against the Japanese yen, as markets focussed on the trade imbalance
between Japan and the United States.
Against the mark, the dollar has moved generally in line with
differentials between interest rates on U.S. and German assets. The
dollar declined sharply following the Federal Reserve's easing
action on December 20, which came one day after the Bundesbank
raised its Lombard and discount rates by half a percentage point.
At its low point in early January, the dollar had declined 4 percent
against the mark and 3 percent on a weighted-average basis. By that
time, the half-point reduction in the federal funds rate had been
fully passed through to U.S. three-month interest rates, and the
U.S. ten-year bond yield had declined by nearly that amount, while
the German three-month rate had risen 10 basis points and the German
bond yield had eased about 15 basis points. Since early January,
the dollar has rebounded sharply against the mark as U.S. interest
rates have moved back up amid expectations of a turnaround in the
U.S. economy and German interest rates have moved lower in response
to signs of a German economic slowdown and favorable news on German
inflation. The dollar's strength against the mark was tempered by
speculation about G-7 intervention to hold down the dollar and by
concern that accelerating German money growth may prompt the
Bundesbank to keep interest rates high.

After the recent rebound in U.S. interest rates, the net
movement in long-term differentials over the period has been in
favor of the dollar. The U.S. 10-year bond yield has risen 10 basis
points on net since December 17, while the Japanese bellwether bond
yield has declined 35 basis points and the German yield has declined
30 basis points. Changes in short-term differentials are mixed:
German three-month rates are unchanged on balance, while U.S. three-
month rates have eased 35 basis points. Japanese three-month rates
have declined a full percentage point, perhaps anticipating more
easing than the half percentage point decrease in the Bank of
Japan's official discount rate on December 30 and the subsequent 75
basis point decline in the Japanese call money rate.
Despite lower Japanese interest rates, the yen has strengthened
on balance since the last FOMC meeting. The dollar weakened against
the yen ahead of President Bush's trip to Japan, with both U.S. and
Japanese officials indicating that an easing of the dollar against
the yen would help reduce trade imbalances. The dollar subsequently
rebounded to above its December 17 level against the yen, prompting
the Desk to sell dollars against yen on January 17. The
intervention surprised the market and drove the dollar sharply lower
against the yen, to a low of ¥122 in Asian trading the following
Monday. Late in the period, the dollar rose somewhat after the G-7
communique on January 25 failed to call for a stronger yen.
The Canadian dollar has declined about 2-1/2 percent against
the U.S. dollar over the intermeeting period. Canadian three-month
and long-term interest rates have declined about 10 basis points
more than U.S. rates. Late in the period, the Canadian dollar was
hurt by the announcement of a large increase in the Ontario budget
deficit and by worries about a possible downgrading of Ontario
provincial debt.

IV-14
The only U.S.
intervention was the action on January 17, when the Desk sold $50
million against yen, evenly split between System and Treasury
accounts.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent data on economic activity in the major foreign
industrial countries suggest that relatively weak growth continued
into the fourth quarter. Real GNP in Germany appears to have been
unchanged in the fourth quarter, although there have been some
positive monthly indicators. Evidence continues to accumulate of an
uneven recovery in eastern Germany. Recent monthly indicators show
weak activity in Japan and mixed performance in France, Italy,
Canada, and the United Kingdom.
Inflation appears to have remained steady or continued to
decline modestly in the foreign industrial countries. In Japan, a
sharp decrease in consumer prices in December largely reflected a
weather-related fall in the price of perishable foods. Consumer-
price inflation moderated in western Germany and the United Kingdom,
but high wage growth continues to be a concern for policymakers in
both countries. Recent price data for Canada and France show
continued progress on inflation.
Individual country notes. In Japan, most recent indicators
continue to suggest relatively weak growth in activity. Industrial
production (s.a.) fell 0.9 percent in December and was 1.4 percent
below its year-earlier level. New passenger car registrations
(s.a.) fell 8.1 percent in December, and new machinery orders (s.a.)
declined 13.9 percent in October. Bankruptcies (s.a.) rose a

further 5.1 percent in November, making their 12-month increase 75.1
percent. The index of leading indicators (s.a.) fell to its lowest
level in more than 11 years in November. Only housing starts showed
some strength, increasing 4.3 percent (s.a.) in November, but they
remained 19.3 percent below their year-earlier level.
Reflecting weaker economic activity, the unemployment rate
(s.a.) edged up to 2.1 percent in November, while the ratio of job
offers to applicants (s.a.) declined for the seventh time in eight
months to a level 8.4 percent below that of November 1990.
Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remains near record low levels.
Underlying inflationary pressures appear to have remained
unchanged. Consumer prices in the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) decreased 0.7
percent in December, and their 12-month increase slowed to 2.9
percent. Much of the decrease was due to a weather-related fall in
prices for perishable foods. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) were
unchanged in December and showed a 12-month decrease of 1.6 percent.
The trade surplus (s.a.) narrowed slightly in December. For
1991 as a whole, however, the trade surplus increased $26 billion to
$78 billion. The volume of both imports and exports rose 3 percent
in 1991. The unit value of imports in yen terms fell 8.2 percent,
reflecting the effects of yen appreciation and lower average oil
prices, while export unit value in yen terms declined only 0.5
percent.
On December 28, the Cabinet approved a budget for the new
fiscal year beginning in April. The proposed FY1992 budget appears
to be about neutral in its macroeconomic impact. Central government
spending is set to increase by only 2.7 percent. However, spending
under the separate capital budget is up 7.2 percent. The general
government balance, including social security, should remain in
substantial surplus. At the time of President Bush's early January

IV-19
visit to Japan, Prime Minister Miyazawa agreed that the Japanese
government would monitor economic activity closely and consider
additional measures if growth falters.
According to preliminary data, real GNP in western Germany
increased 3.2 percent in 1991, compared with an annual average
increase of 4.5 percent in 1990. Data for the fourth quarter will
not be released for about six weeks, but an official of the
Statistical Office stated that real GNP appeared to have been
unchanged in the fourth quarter.
Monthly indicators for the fourth quarter present a somewhat
more positive picture. Industrial production in western Germany
(s.a.) increased 1.2 percent in November, following an increase of
0.2 percent in October. The volume of retail sales (s.a.) in
western Germany increased 0.7 percent in both September and October.
Also, the volume of new orders for west German manufactured goods
(s.a.) increased 0.2 percent in November, reversing a decline of the
same magnitude in October. Between September and November, domestic
orders increased 1.7 percent, while foreign orders fell 3.4 percent.
The west German unemployment rate (s.a.) fell 0.1 percentage point
to 6.2 percent in December.
Evidence continues to accumulate that an uneven recovery is
underway in eastern Germany. Industrial production in eastern
Germany (n.s.a.) increased 8.4 percent in September, putting this
volatile series 10.3 percent above its April trough. The pace of
new orders for construction in eastern Germany (n.s.a.) has
increased steadily since February, and September's level was almost
twice the average level for the second half of 1990. Official east
German unemployment (n.s.a.) increased 0.1 percentage point to 11.8
percent in December, but it remained below the July peak of 12.1
percent. The number of "short-time" workers subsidized by the

IV-20
government declined to 11.6 percent (n.s.a.) of the labor force in
December, its lowest level since July 1990.
Consumer prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.5 percent in January and
stood 4 percent above year-earlier levels, down from 4.2 percent in
December. In the fourth quarter, consumer prices on a seasonally
adjusted basis increased at an annual rate of 3.3 percent. West
German producer prices (n.s.a.) fell 0.1 percent in November and
were 2.5 percent above year-earlier levels. West German import
prices (n.s.a.) fell 0.6 percent in November and are 2 percent below
where they were a year earlier.
Accelerating unit labor costs in western Germany continue to be
a source of concern. Average hourly earnings in western Germany
(s.a.) increased 8.3 percent in the year to October, compared with
6.5 percent at the end of 1990. In contrast, output per hour in
west German industry (s.a.) increased only 2.3 percent in the year
to October, compared with 3.8 percent at the end of 1990.
Wage negotiations for 1992 are continuing in the steel industry
with discussion focusing on a range of wage increases between 5-1/2
and 6 percent. Although the steel workers union is relatively
small, these negotiations in the past have set a precedent for other
more important contracts. Both the public sector employees and
metal workers unions are asking for wage increases of 9-1/2 percent
this year.
On December 19, the Bundesbank raised its discount and Lombard
rates by 1/2 percentage point. This action was taken in response to
increased inflation since mid year, an acceleration in money growth,
and concerns over the outcome of current wage negotiations. Through
December, M3 (s.a.) in western and eastern Germany had increased at
an annual rate of 5.7 percent in 1991, relative to the fourth

IV-21
quarter of 1990, up from 4.5 percent through September. The recent
acceleration in M3 primarily reflects strong demand for bank loans.
In France, real GDP rose 2.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third
quarter, following an increase of the same size in the second
quarter. Moderate growth in consumption and exports, and a
significant amount of inventory accumulation contributed to the
third-quarter result. Monthly indicators for the fourth quarter are
mixed. Industrial production fell 0.6 percent (s.a.) in November,
partially reversing a 1.2 percent rise in October. Consumption of
manufactured products also declined in November after rising sharply
in October. The unemployment rate in December remained unchanged at
9.8 percent.
The consumer price index in December was 3.1 percent above its
level a year earlier. A lessening of inflationary pressures was
evident in the 0.6 percent (n.s.a.) third-quarter increase in hourly
wages in the private sector, about half the second-quarter increase.
In December, France registered a trade deficit of $0.8 billion
(s.a.), following a small surplus in November. The trade deficit
for 1991 was $5.4 billion, a significant improvement from the 1990
deficit of $9.3 billion, as the bilateral deficit with Germany
narrowed sharply. Exports grew 3-3/4 percent, compared with 3
percent growth in 1990, while import growth declined to 2 percent
from 3.3 percent in 1990.
In Italy, the economy has stagnated in recent months, with no
sign of the recovery that was widely forecast for the second half of
1991. Third-quarter GDP rose only 0.4 percent (s.a.a.r.), down from
a modest 1.6 percent rise in the previous quarter. Fixed investment
was a source of strength, increasing 6.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
third quarter following a 7.4 percent increase in the second
quarter. Weakness was concentrated in net exports. Industrial

IV-22
production (s.a.) fell 2 percent in October. The unemployment rate
(n.s.a.) rose to 11 percent in October, up from 10.6 percent in the
previous reporting month (July).
Inflation has eased in Italy but remains well above rates in
key EMS partners, Germany and France. Consumer prices in December
were 6 percent above their level a year earlier, down from 6.2
percent in November. Wholesale prices in November were 2.4 percent
above a year earlier. The index of wages and salaries in major
union contracts was up 9.4 percent in September from a year earlier.
The 1992 budget, approved by parliament just prior to the
January 1 deadline, aims to reduce the 1992 central government
budget deficit (including certain off-budget entities such as the
postal service) to 128 trillion lire, or 8.4 percent of GDP. The
1991 deficit was 150-155 trillion lire, roughly 10-1/2 to 11 percent
of GDP. Unfortunately, the new budget package once again puts off
major reforms. Most outside observers project a deficit in excess
of 9 percent of GDP, in which case additional fiscal measures will
be needed after general elections occur this spring. With public
debt now estimated to be over 100 percent of GDP, interest payments
consume over one-fifth of total government revenue.
In the United Kingdom, the latest data provide little evidence
of a strong recovery. Real GDP grew 0.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
third quarter, after contracting 2.8 percent in the second quarter.
In the third quarter, inventories contributed more than 4 percent
(s.a.a.r.) to growth as the runoff of inventories during the
previous three quarters came to an end. Government spending grew
1.6 percent (s.a.a.r.), contributing 0.3 percentage points to
growth. Consumer spending remained flat and was down 3 percent from
its pre-recession level, while investment fell 2.5 percent to a

IV-23
level more than 15 percent below that preceding the recession. Net
exports made a negative contribution to growth.
In November, manufacturing production (s.a.) rose 0.1 percent
after several months of decline and was 1.1 percent below the third-
quarter average level. Retail sales (s.a.) fell 1 percent in
December; the average for the fourth quarter was 0.3 percent below
the third-quarter average. After increasing steadily since the end
of the Gulf War, consumer confidence has recoiled since October.
Business confidence about prospects for sales and orders has fallen
since September as well. The unemployment rate (s.a.) has continued
to climb, reaching 9 percent in December.
Consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in December, to a level 4.5
percent above December 1990. The government's measure of underlying
inflation, which excludes mortgage interest rates, stood at 5.8
percent. Producers' output prices rose 0.1 percent in December to a
level 5 percent above year-ago levels. However, wages continued to
increase at an underlying rate of 7-1/2 percent in November.
The recession has contributed to a narrowing of Britain's
current account deficit. The 1991 current account deficit was $11.6
billion compared with a deficit of $25.8 billion in 1990.
In Canada, monthly data for the fourth-quarter indicate that
the recovery that began in the second quarter remains tentative. In
October, industrial production (s.a.) dropped 0.6 percent, but a 0.1
percent increase in GDP at factor cost suggested some compensating
strength in the service sector. November saw more robust demand in
goods markets, as retail sales (s.a.) rose 0.7 percent, factory
shipments (s.a.) increased 0.6 percent, new orders rose 0.2 percent,
and unit sales of motor vehicles were up 9.6 percent. In December,
further weakness was evident, as the unemployment rate (s.a.) was

IV-24
unchanged at 10.3 percent, while total employment (s.a.) fell 0.2
percent, and housing starts (s.a.) were down 3 percent.
The weaker-than-expected economy caused the federal government
budget deficit to increase in 1991. On January 27, Finance Minister
Don Mazankowski announced a freeze on federal government hiring and
discretionary expenditure for the remainder of the fiscal year which
ends March 31.
Recent price data show that the government's anti-inflation
efforts have achieved some results. The all-items consumer price
index (n.s.a) fell 0.5 percent in December, and twelve-month
consumer price inflation decreased from 4.2 percent to 3.8 percent.
The CPI excluding food and energy (n.s.a.) dropped 0.3 percent, and
has increased only 3 percent (a.r.) since the 7 percent Goods and
Services Tax was introduced in January 1991. Industrial product
prices (n.s.a.) rose 0.1 percent in December, but stand 3.1 percent
lower than they were twelve-months earlier. On average, wage
settlements increased only 3.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first 11
months of 1991, compared with 5.7 percent in 1990.
The combined merchandise trade surplus for October and November
was only $2.3 billion (s.a.a.r.) compared with a $7.8 billion
surplus (s.a.a.r) in the first nine months of the year.
Little progress has been made in discussions of the National
Unity Plan constitutional reform proposals announced by the federal
government last September. The Cabinet intends to submit specific
constitutional amendments to Parliament by early April. Should it
deem the revised proposals to be unacceptable, the provincial
government of Quebec has promised to hold a referendum this autumn,
in which voters may choose among alternatives including secession.

IV-25
Developments in the Former Soviet Union and East European Countries
On December 21, 1991, Russia was joined by all former Soviet
republics except Georgia and the Baltics in forming the Commonwealth
of Independent States to replace the Soviet Union. Despite initial
statements on coordination of economic policies, no agreement has
been reached on long-term monetary, banking, or trade policies. The
Russian central bank has essentially assumed the functions of the
former USSR Gosbank. By all reports, monetary emission is
continuing to increase without control as the Russian central bank
attempts to meet the rising demand for rubles from each of the
former republics. Some republics, such as Ukraine, are proceeding
with plans to introduce their own currencies.
On January 2, 1992, the Russian republic proceeded with its
widely anticipated price reform measures; other republics, most
notably Ukraine and Byelarus, followed. Prices on basic goods and
services were increased to three to five times their former level.
Prices of items not subject to controlled increases are supposed to
find market-clearing levels. However, reports indicate that
competitive pricing is still the exception rather than the norm in
state stores. Output in the Russian republic is estimated to have
fallen about 9 percent of GNP in 1991.
The Russian government faces a formidable task in controlling
the budget deficit. Expenditures are likely to be fueled by
promised wage increases and pressures to raise pensions to soften
the effect of increased prices. The government is hoping to
stabilize the budget deficit through a new value-added tax, cuts in
military expenditures, and reduced subsidies. The budget deficit of
the Russian republic, including the portion of the former Soviet
Union budget taken over by the Russian republic, appears to have
exceeded 20 percent of GNP in 1991.

The Russian central bank recently announced establishment of a
"market rate" of 110 rubles per dollar and a commercial exchange
rate of 55 rubles per dollar. Selected export enterprises (mainly
agriculture, minerals, forestry, and chemicals) are obliged to sell
40 percent of their hard currency earnings to the Russian government
at the commercial exchange rate and will also be required to sell 10
percent of their foreign exchange proceeds at the market rate of 110
rubles per dollar. In late January, the black market exchange rate
was quoted between 120 and 150 rubles per dollar.
Russia has applied for membership in the IMF, as have Ukraine,
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and the Baltic states.
Throughout Eastern Europe, the move to a market system has had
severe effects on measured economic activity. From negligible
levels at the start of their reform efforts, reported unemployment
rates have moved steadily up to 11.4 percent in Poland, 11 percent
in Bulgaria, 8.3 percent in Hungary, 6.6 percent in Czechoslovakia,
and 4 percent in Romania. Measures of real GNP and industrial
production for the region in 1991 are estimated to have fallen about
15 percent and 20 percent, respectively, with real GNP declines
ranging from about 8 percent in Hungary to 20 percent or more in
Bulgaria, Romania, and Yugoslavia. However, these numbers
underreport activity in fast-growing private sectors. In some
countries, increases in consumer prices have stabilized after large
increases in the initial stages of reform, and monthly inflation at
the end of 1991 was on the order of 1-2 percent in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, and 3 percent in Poland. Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Poland, and Romania have IMF programs (all but Poland are
adhering to the targets set out in those agreements), and Albania
hopes to receive its first IMF program in 1992.

IV-27
In Poland, in late December the Parliament approved the new
center-right government of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski. However,
President Walesa's recent nominee for Central Bank President was
rejected by the Parliament, and the Central Bank has been without a
President since August 1991. The fiscal deficit, which nearly
doubled in 1991 to 6 percent of GDP and caused Poland's IMF program
to go off track in mid year, has been stabilized at that level for
the first quarter of 1992 through a variety of one-time measures
(mostly expenditure cuts or deferrals), but longer-term goals of
creating a less-distortionary, broad-based tax system and imposing
discipline on state enterprise spending have not been addressed.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
The IMF approved a 20-month $2 billion stand-by arrangement for
Brazil on January 29, following assurances by the Brazilian
government that court-ordered increases in pensions would not be
allowed to throw the program out of compliance. Negotiations
between Brazil and the Paris Club and its commercial bank creditors
are continuing. On December 20, the IMF approved a modified stand-
by arrangement for Argentina, as well as a waiver for missing its
fiscal targets in the third quarter of 1991; preliminary data
indicate that Argentina met its fiscal targets in the fourth
quarter. In Mexico, real GDP was 3.1 percent above its year-earlier
level in the third quarter of 1991, down from a revised 4.9 percent
increase in the second quarter; growth in all of 1991 officially is
estimated at 4.5 percent, up from 3.9 percent in 1990. Mexico's
trade deficit for the first ten months of 1991 registered $5.1
billion compared with $0.5 billion in 1990. The Philippines missed
its 1991 fourth quarter monetary targets under its IMF program by a
small margin, prompting the IMF staff to delay its report to the
Executive Board pending additional actions to be taken by the

IV-28
government in early February. Venezuela's 1991 real GDP growth of
9.2 percent was among the world's highest. Korea registered a
record $9.8 billion current account deficit in the first 11 months
of 1991, while consumer price inflation was 9.5 percent for the
year. In Taiwan, both economic activity and the trade surplus
strengthened in 1991 while inflation remained about unchanged at 4.4
percent.
Individual country notes. Brazil's request for a 20-month $2
billion stand-by arrangement was approved by the IMF Executive Board
January 29. The Brazilian authorities have assured IMF management
that, despite fiscal pressures, including regional court orders to
increase certain social security pensions by 147 percent, they are
determined to adhere to the conditions of the standby. To
underscore the government's commitment to fiscal discipline, on
January 20 President Collor issued a decree halting the pension
increases mandated by the courts. While the decree was ruled
constitutional by the Supreme Court on January 22, the large states
of Rio and Sao Paulo are defying it. The administration is moving
to negotiate with Congress ways to offset the increase in social
security spending.
The government has been maintaining real interest rates at very
high levels, in the 3-7 percent per month range, but is facing
intense pressures to reduce them. Industrial production in October
1991, the latest available month, was 0.5 percent below its year-
earlier level. Monthly consumer price inflation registered 24.2
percent in December, down marginally from 26.5 percent in November,
but is expected to rise in January.
The trade surplus for 1991 was $10.6 billion, about the same as
in 1990. The latest official estimate of liquid international
reserves is $7 billion as of the end of November, down from a recent

IV-29
peak of $9.2 billion in June. However, according to unofficial
estimates, international reserves rose by $2 billion in December, as
high domestic interest rates have induced heavy capital inflows.
In mid-December, Brazil's bank advisory committee presented a
proposal to resolve the issue of whether interest on restructured
obligations would carry guarantees. One option would have a portion
of the interest on the debt collateralized when the agreement is
signed, with the remaining collateral to be put up within a
specified time. Under the second option, only a portion of the debt
would be restructured in the near future and have its interest
collateralized. The proposal also would reduce the period for
rolling interest guarantees from 18 months to 15 months and would
decrease interest rates on the new instruments. So far, Brazil has
not responded to this initiative.
Brazil has completed its payments of $2 billion in cash, out of
$8 billion in interest arrears that had accumulated between mid-1989
and December 1990, as agreed last April. The rest of the arrears
will be converted into bonds when the overall restructuring
agreement is concluded. Brazil recently announced that it will
continue to pay 30 percent of interest currently falling due and is
expected to continue partial payment until a commercial debt
restructuring package is completed. Interest arrears accumulated
since January 1991 totaled an estimated $2.6 billion as of end-1991.
Paris Club creditors held a "preliminary" meeting in late
January to prepare for Brazil's formal request for a rescheduling,
possibly in late February. Brazil has estimated total arrears of
about $8.5 billion (about $4.4 billion in interest) to official
creditors.
On December 20, 1991, the IMF approved a modification of
Argentina's stand-by arrangement and a waiver allowing Argentina to

IV-30
receive the second drawing under the arrangement, since a greater
fraction of the overall fiscal surplus for the third quarter was
derived from asset sales than was specified under the program.
Preliminary data indicate that Argentina met its performance targets
for the fourth quarter. In consequence, considerable progress has
been made toward negotiation of a three-year Extended Fund Facility,
which would replace the one-year program approved in July 1991. The
EFF, which is expected to be approved in early Spring, will provide
part of the financing necessary to support a restructuring of
Argentina's $31 billion in commercial bank debt, including about $8
billion in interest arrears. Negotiations on this package started
at the end of January.
Economic conditions have remained stable since the last
Greenbook. The monthly rate of CPI inflation edged up to 0.6
percent in December from 0.4 percent in November; it is expected to
register between 1 and 2 percent in January, due to transitory
upticks in food and services prices. Industrial production in
October, the latest available month, was 12 percent above its year-
earlier level, up from 9 percent in September.
Mexico's real GDP growth, year-over-year, slowed to 3.1 percent
in the third quarter of 1991 from a downward-revised 4.9 percent in
the second quarter. The slower growth rate in the third quarter
reflected a reduction in liquidity in late August and September,
attributable mainly to the sale by the government of Mexico's
leading commercial bank, and the fact that third-quarter growth in
1990 was especially high. The latest official estimate of growth
for 1991 as a whole is 4.5 percent, up from 3.9 percent in 1990.
The U.S. recession appears to have had only a modest impact on
Mexican exports. Notwithstanding some slowing since mid-1991, non-
oil exports in the first 10 months of 1991 were 13 percent above

IV-31
their year-earlier values. However, oil export earnings were 10.8
percent lower in the first ten months of 1991 than their year-
earlier level, reflecting the decline in oil prices following the
end of the Gulf War. As a result, the increase in total exports was
only 5.5 percent. With imports 23.4 percent higher in the first ten
months of 1991 than in the same period of 1990, the ten-month trade
deficit was $5.1 billion compared with $544 million in 1990.
International reserves, including gold, are estimated to have
increased by about $8 billion during 1991 to $18 billion at the end
of December. The floating peso/dollar exchange rate has tended to
remain in the lower half of its target zone,
The rate was about 3,073 pesos on January 27.
compared with a lower limit of 3,056 pesos and an upper limit of
3,102 pesos, and was about the same level as when the target-zone
system was adopted last November.
At the January 29 auction, the
28-day Treasury bill rate was 15.5 percent, compared with 16.1
percent on December 3. The December-over-December rate of consumer
price inflation was 18.8 percent in 1991, down from 29.9 percent in
1990.
An IMF team that visited the Philippines in early January found
that the country had missed its end-December targets for base money
and broad money, although by relatively small amounts. The staff
report to the IMF Board will be delayed until early February, by
which time the Philippine authorities should have enacted a second
increase in electricity prices (the first increase took place
January 5), as required under the IMF program, and a group of
revenue measures now being considered by the Senate. The Aquino
administration has promised to reduce government expenditures in

IV-32
1992 in order to meet the agreed IMF budget deficit target if the
Senate fails to act.
Venezuela was one of the world's fastest growing economies last
year. According to preliminary data, real GDP rose 9.2 percent,
compared with 5.3 percent in 1990, based on sharp increases in
investment in the petroleum and construction sectors. Inflation on
a December-over-December basis declined from 36 percent in 1990 to
31 percent in 1991. Lower oil export earnings and a surge in
imports cut the current account surplus from $7.5 billion in 1990 to
an estimated $1.1 billion last year. The consolidated government
fiscal account registered a surplus estimated at 1 percent of GDP in
1991, thanks to extraordinary revenues of 3.5 percent of GDP from
privatization of the national airline and telephone companies.
In 1991, Korean consumer prices were 9.5 percent higher in
December than a year earlier. M2 rose 18.6 percent on average,
which was near the top of the central bank's targeted range of 17-19
percent. Real GDP was 8.8 percent higher in the first three
quarters of 1991 than its year-earlier level, down from 9.8 percent
in the same period of 1990. Korea's current account deficit was a
record $9.8 billion in the first eleven months of last year.
External debt increased $6.5 billion to $38.2 billion in the first
ten months of 1991.
In Taiwan, economic activity picked up in 1991 due to stronger
exports and rising public investment. Industrial activity rose 7.2
percent after falling 1 percent in 1990. Exports rose 13.3 percent
due in part to large increases in shipments to China (through Hong
Kong); the cumulative trade surplus (on a customs basis) was $13.3
billion, up somewhat from $12.5 billion in 1990. Consumer prices
were 4.4 percent higher in December than a year earlier, nearly
unchanged from the 4.6 percent increase in 1990. On December 21,

IV-33
the ruling party won 78 percent of the seats in National Assembly
elections, the first general elections in Taiwan. On January 8,
Taiwan's central bank lowered its rediscount rate 0.375 percentage
points to 5.875 percent, the fifth reduction in six months. In
addition, reserve requirements were lowered further. Despite these
moves, the NT dollar has continued to appreciate to record highs
against the U.S. dollar.
