created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Retail sales and housing starts climbed steeply in the first
two months of this year. However, businesses evidently have been
meeting at least some of the increased demand by drawing down excess
inventories that accumulated in the latter part of 1991. Moreover,
the contraction in commercial building and in government spending is
still damping overall activity. Slack in labor and product markets
has continued to restrain wage and price increases; the year-over-
year change in the core CPI is at the lowest ebb since 1987.
Employment and Unemployment
Job market data have provided mixed signals of late, but on
balance they suggest only a slight improvement in labor demand early
this year. Nonfarm payroll employment rose 164,000 in February, the
largest increase since May 1990; however, certain features of the
rise suggest that it may not reflect ongoing influences. Most of
the gain was in the retail trade sector where seasonal swings are
particularly large around the turn of the year; retail employment,
on a not seasonally adjusted basis, normally drops in February, and
the decline this year was less than usual, mirroring less-than-
normal hiring during the Christmas season. Another contributor to
the February upturn was an increase of 12,000 in factory payrolls
after five months of decline. The return to work of 30,000 auto
workers from temporary layoff more than accounted for the rise, and
employment was either little changed or down slightly throughout the
remainder of the manufacturing sector. The picture in other sectors
was mixed, with a moderate increase in services and small declines
in construction and government.
The average workweek in private industry jumped 0.4 hour in
February, resulting in a sharp rise in aggregate hours worked by

production or nonsupervisory workers. The workweek rose 0.3 hour in
manufacturing, and gains were even larger in some service-producing
sectors in which movements tend to be highly erratic. With weekly
hours moving above pre-recession levels in some sectors--including
finance, services, and manufacturing--we are inclined to discount
some of the February increase in both the workweek and aggregate
hours; in any event, the average level of aggregate hours in January
and February stood just 0.2 percent above the fourth-quarter level
(not at an annual rate).
Lingering weakness in labor demand is also evident in the
still-elevated level of weekly filings of initial claims for
unemployment insurance. Claims have fluctuated around 450,000 in
recent weeks, a level little changed from the one that has prevailed
since last summer. This suggests that a continuing stream of
layoffs is still damping the growth in employment.

Further layoffs also were apparent in data from the household
survey. The unemployment rate rose to 7.3 percent in February from
7.1 percent in January and December, with job losers accounting for
most of the increase. On a more positive note, however, the labor
force expanded sharply for the third consecutive month, with the
entrants apparently moving into jobs. This suggests that actual
hiring activity may have picked up in some areas, although not yet
at a pace sufficient to offset continued job cutbacks elsewhere.
The labor force gains in recent months have been concentrated among
men and women 25 years and older; in contrast, labor force levels

II-5
were little changed for teenagers and young adults, the groups that
experienced the largest declines in participation in 1990 and early
1991.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
Industrial production increased 0.6 percent in February,
retracing about one-third of the decline since the beginning of the
fourth quarter. The motor vehicle industry--where assemblies moved
up to 9.1 million units at an annual rate in February from
8.2 million in January (FRB seasonals)--accounted for about half of
the increase. In contrast, utility output remained low in February
as this winter's unseasonably warm weather continued. With the rise
in production in February, capacity utilization for all industry
moved back up to 78.2 percent, but was still 5-1/2 percentage points
below the July 1990 peak.
Excluding motor vehicles and utilities, industrial production
rose 0.4 percent in February. The February increase was broad, with
output of materials, intermediate products, and final products all
up. Among final products, output of both business equipment and
consumer goods posted gains. Production of consumer durables
(excluding motor vehicles) increased more than 1 percent last month,
after sharp declines in December and January. Production of
consumer nondurables other than utility output also picked up in
February. Within business equipment, production of industrial
equipment firmed, after having declined for six consecutive months,
and output of office and computing equipment continued to post
strong gains.
Output of defense and space equipment, which moved down
0.9 percent in February, has continued to exert a small but
significant drag on overall manufacturing activity. This category
of industrial production has fallen about 14 percent from its peak

year of 1987 (chart). The decline has directly sliced about
0.2 percentage point per year off industrial production, and if
indirect effects on the demand for other materials and parts are
counted as well, the restraint amounts to about 0.3 percentage point
per year. Defense and space output has not yet fallen as much,
nor as steeply, as it did after the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and the
spending cuts approved to date imply less of a decline in output
than in those earlier episodes of downsizing.
Weekly measures of production were relatively flat in early
March. Electricity generation increased, and production of home
goods--such as appliances, televisions, and air conditioners--posted
further gains. In contrast, output of steel products fell back.
Through mid-March, domestic production of motor vehicles was running
at about the February pace, somewhat short of schedules. In
February, capacity utilization at domestic auto and light truck
plants stood at 65.5 percent.

Looking further ahead, capacity in the domestic auto industry
is expected to move slightly higher in the 1993 model year despite
the well-publicized announcements of plant-closings by General
Motors. Annual light vehicle assembly capacity for the U.S. motor
vehicle industry is slated to increase about 200,000 units to
13.2 million units and to remain at that higher level in the 1994
model year (table). Declines in the automobile assembly capacity of

5-1/2 percent of industrial production on a value-added basis.

II-9
domestic nameplate producers are expected to be more than offset by
increased capacity at their light truck plants and at Japanese
transplants; in addition, some of the largest closings announced by
GM are not scheduled to take place until 1994. 2
Consumption and Personal Income
Recent data on consumer spending have been decidedly upbeat.
However, current income growth looks to be insufficient to support a
continuation of strong consumption gains, and, although consumer
sentiment apparently has improved, it remains less favorable than
last spring and summer. The survey evidence points to a still-
cautious attitude toward the use of savings or new borrowing to
finance purchases.
Retail sales were ebullient in the first two months of the
year. Excluding the automotive group, the initial estimate for
February showed an increase of 1.3 percent, and the rise in January
was revised up from 0.6 percent to 2.0 percent. The increase in
both months was relatively broad and is consistent with anecdotal
reports of a considerable pickup in consumer spending since the
beginning of the year. In assessing the magnitude of the
improvement, however, it is important to recognize that the initial
monthly retail sales estimates are subject to considerable and
repeated revision. Indeed, the upward revision to the initial
January estimate was one of the largest in recent years, and an
analysis of past patterns provides some reason to think that the
2. Light truck assembly capacity will expand because Ford is
adding a plant in Ohio, Chrysler is starting a new plant in Detroit,
and Chrysler is adding a third shift to a minivan plant in St.
Louis. Among transplant producers, Honda and Nissan are anticipated
to increase auto capacity notably. GM's Willow Run assembly plant
is scheduled to be removed from capacity after the 1993 model year.

January figure may be revised down.3 As may be seen in the
chart, however, even if the January and February increases were to
be revised down significantly, the back-to-back gains would probably
still be sufficient to sharply boost outlays for nonauto goods in
real terms this quarter.
Sales of motor vehicles also have improved recently, but the
volume remains unimpressive. In February, total sales of motor
vehicles rose to a 12.5 million unit annual rate, after January's
11.85 million unit annual pace. Sales of vehicles produced in North
America continued to improve in March, registering a 10.1 million
unit annual pace during the first twenty days of the month. While
this selling rate is the strongest for these vehicles since last
summer, it remains well below the 11-1/2 million unit rate that
prevailed in the second half of the 1980s. Buy-American campaigns
have not translated into increased market share for domestic
nameplates; in fact, their market share edged lower from January to
February. However, impending price increases for Japanese-brand
vehicles were highly publicized, and a desire to buy in advance of
the price hikes might have been responsible for the increased market
share of foreign nameplates.
The University of Michigan's preliminary report on consumer
sentiment for early March revealed the first significant rise since
attitudes deteriorated sharply last fall. Nonetheless, the
composite index in March was still below the level that prevailed in
late summer. No March figure is available yet for the Conference
3. The staff has examined revisions in spending estimates over
the past three years for the retail control category--retail sales
excluding motor vehicles and building material and supply stores.
Of the four upward revisions between the initial and the second
estimate that were more than one standard deviation from the mean
revision during this period, three were subsequently revised down
between the second and the final estimate. A more formal test found
statistical evidence of negative serial correlation in revisions,
although the analysis was only able to explain a small portion of
the variance in revisions.

Board's index of consumer confidence; this index dropped last month
to the lowest level since 1974, but the Conference Board has said
that responses received at the end of the month--too late for
inclusion--were more positive than those used to compute their
published February figure.
Housing
The housing market appears to be continuing on a recovery path.
Single-family housing starts rose substantially in both January and
February, reaching the highest level since March 1990. New home
sales also rose to pre-recession heights in January, and existing
home sales in February more than reversed a dip in January, reaching
their highest level since January 1989. In addition, builders'
attitudes continued to improve, and consumers' homebuying
attitudes--which dropped back in March from a February peak--remain
well above levels seen in recent years (chart). Furthermore, market
fundamentals--house prices and interest rates--are generally more
favorable than they were a year ago and argue for some further
improvement in the single-family market. By contrast, no near-term
relief is likely for the multifamily sector, in which vacancy rates
remain historically high despite the reduced production of recent
years.
A number of recent reports have emphasized the influence of
several special factors on housing activity. However, we believe
that these factors likely explain only a portion of the recent
pickup. One popular story is that the unusually warm weather this
winter accounted for much of the January-February rise in housing
market activity, largely because weather conditions were
particularly favorable in the Midwest, where the pickup in housing
was concentrated. However, permit issuance--which is less sensitive
than starts to short-run weather influences--also was up

substantially, suggesting that the strength in the housing sector is
not due solely to favorable weather.
A second factor that has been cited as a possible explanation
for the pickup in activity is the upturn in mortgage interest rates
that began in mid-January. If the upturn convinced some prospective
homebuyers that rates had bottomed for the foreseeable future, a
rush to buy in advance of further rate increases could be boosting
current sales. However, such an effect has not been clearly evident
in past episodes when rates turned up after a prolonged downtrend
(chart); for example, home sales and single-family starts did not,
in general, rise immediately following the turnaround in mortgage
rates in 1983, 1986, or 1987.
A third factor that may be influencing housing activity is the
set of proposals to provide a tax break to first-time homebuyers.
The direction of the effect, however, is unclear: The prospect of a
credit could be drawing new buyers into the market, but uncertainty
about passage of these proposals could be delaying some purchases.
In any event, it seems unlikely that the net effect has been large.
Business Fixed Investment
After falling for five consecutive quarters, real business
fixed investment appears to have stabilized in early 1992--with a
rebound in equipment outlays likely offsetting a further
deterioration in nonresidential construction.
On the equipment side, spending in the current quarter is
likely to be boosted by purchases of transportation equipment and
computers. Aircraft outlays dropped to a very low level in the
fourth quarter (chart), and Boeing reported a large increase in
shipments of its aircraft to domestic airlines in January and
4. In addition, each of the past three winters has been unusually
favorable for construction, and to the extent that starts have
responded to these weather abnormalities, the current seasonal
factors already have begun to correct for this weather pattern.

II-19
February; for the first quarter as a whole, real aircraft purchases
are likely to increase several billion dollars at an annual rate.
Business purchases of motor vehicles also appear to have
strengthened, with a sharp increase in sales of heavy trucks in
December sustained, on balance, in January and February; sales of
these trucks in January and February averaged about 5 percent above
their fourth-quarter level. In addition, real investment in
computers, which rose 40 percent at an annual rate in the fourth
quarter, is likely to post another double-digit increase in the
current quarter. Nominal shipments of office and computing
equipment in January and February were 4-1/2 percent above the
fourth-quarter level, while the average PPI for electronic computers
in January and February was 2-1/4 percent below the fourth-quarter
level.
Outside of transportation equipment and computers, spending for
capital equipment looks to have declined so far this year. In
January and February, shipments of nondefense capital goods other
than aircraft and computers averaged 2-1/2 percent below the fourth-
quarter level, with widespread weakness across most types of
industrial machinery.
Looking ahead, equipment shipments likely will rise further in
coming months. Excluding aircraft and computers, nominal orders for
nondefense capital goods during January and February were
1.1 percent above the fourth-quarter level and have been trending up
since reaching their trough early last year. For computers,
shipments have been running well above orders since October (chart),
drawing down backlogs of unfilled orders. 5 Consequently, nominal
computer shipments likely will move back in line with orders over
5. This pattern is consistent with the story that IBM began
large-scale shipments of its new line of mainframe computers in the
fourth quarter, with deliveries filling orders that were placed as
long ago as the fall of 1990.

the next few months. Nonetheless, with additional price declines
almost a certainty, near-term purchases in real dollars likely will
continue to rise moderately.
For aircraft, by contrast, the outlook is relatively weak after
the first quarter because the substantial excess capacity among
domestic airlines has prompted a severe retrenchment in aircraft
orders. Boeing's new orders from domestic carriers have been
stagnant in recent months after trending down sharply since the end
of 1989 (chart). Order deferrals and cancellations also have
increased recently; for example, United Airlines recently announced
that it would defer almost $7 billion of ordered aircraft. At
Boeing, most of the cutbacks have affected orders that were
originally scheduled for shipment in 1993 and beyond; planned
purchases of Boeing planes in 1992 appear to be little changed. 6
In contrast, McDonnell-Douglas has been hit much harder by
cancellations of near-term orders and has already reduced production
of its MD-80 by about one-third.
Nonresidential construction activity continues to be depressed
by an oversupply of commercial buildings. Nominal construction put-
in-place edged up in January but, because of earlier declines, was
still a bit below the fourth-quarter average. The January data
showed further drops in office and hotel construction, the types of
nonresidential buildings for which excess supply appears to be most
severe. Reflecting the continued high level of vacancies, appraised
values of office properties fell further in the fourth quarter of
1991, bringing the cumulative decline in values since 1985 to more
6. Boeing has publicly announced only one production cutback: a
scheduled reduction next October in the production rate of 737s from
the current rate of twenty-one per month to fourteen per month.

than 30 percent (chart). 7 For the non-office commercial sector--
which consists primarily of retail and warehouse properties--
appraised values have been dropping steadily since 1989.
Nonetheless, contracts for this sector have begun to flatten out
(this being visible in the last few observations for the six-month
moving average shown in the chart), suggesting that the steepest
declines in construction activity may be past.
Inventories
Sharp increases in trade inventories late last year have been
followed by reductions early in the first quarter. In current-cost
terms, stocks at wholesale and nonauto retail establishments fell in
January at an annual rate of $17 billion, retracing more than one-
third of the accumulation in the fourth quarter. Even so, for many
types of businesses in the trade sector, inventory-sales ratios
remained at elevated levels in January, raising the possibility of
further paring in subsequent months.
In wholesale trade, weak sales during the fourth quarter led to
some sizable backups in stocks held by distributors of machinery,
motor vehicles, electrical goods, and apparel. In part, however,
the December accumulation of machinery inventories at the wholesale
level was mirrored by a drawdown of machinery stocks in
manufacturing. As wholesale machinery sales picked up in January--
rising 2.4 percent after a 1.1 percent drop during the fourth
quarter--much of the December accumulation was reversed, and the
inventory-sales ratio for wholesalers of machinery plunged to the
lowest level since April 1990. Elsewhere in wholesale trade,
however, stock-sales ratios remained at levels that are relatively
high by historical standards.
7. These data are compiled by the Frank Russell Company in
conjunction with the National Council of Real Estate Investment
Fiduciaries (Russell-NCREIF) and are based on appraised values of
commercial properties owned by major institutional investors.

II-27
In retail trade, robust sales in January reduced the inventory
overhangs that had developed at many types of stores during the
fourth quarter. Nonauto retail inventories were drawn down at an
annual rate of $12 billion in January. For stores in the GAF
group--which includes general merchandise, apparel, and furniture
and appliance stores--strong sales in January helped to lower the
inventory-sales ratio to 2.41 months, significantly below the
December peak of 2.51 months. As in wholesale trade, however,
stocks held by many types of nonauto retailers--particularly sellers
of nondurables goods--were still on the high side in January;
overall, the inventory-sales ratio for nonauto retailers remains
somewhat above its midyear trough.
In contrast, manufacturers have managed to keep their
inventories under control despite sluggish orders and shipments in
recent months. Factory inventories were pared at a $15-1/2 billion
annual rate in January, with much of the drawdown occurring in
defense aircraft and parts, food products, and petroleum.8 On
balance, producers have been reducing their stocks since late 1990,
and inventory-to-shipments ratios in most industries have remained
well below the cyclical peaks reached early last year.
Federal Sector
According to the monthly unified budget data, the federal
government recorded a $148 billion deficit for the first five months
of the fiscal year, up $37 billion from a year earlier. The rise in
the deficit reflects both sluggish receipts and an 8 percent
increase in outlays. Growth in outlays continues to be paced by
health care spending under the Medicaid and Medicare programs and by
spending for cyclically sensitive income-support programs, notably
8. Given the sizable declines in petroleum prices at the producer
level in December and January, much of the January reduction in
petroleum inventories in current-cost terms likely reflects price
changes rather than changes in real quantities.

unemployment insurance. Defense expenditures (excluding DCA
contributions) in January and February were about 6 percent above
year-earlier levels, but that increase is attributable to changes in
the monthly timing of payroll expenditures; after adjusting for the
payroll shifts, defense spending so far this fiscal year has been
about 3 percent below the comparable period in FY1991.
Receipts, which during the first five months of the fiscal year
were up less than 1 percent relative to a year earlier, have been
held down by slow income growth and faster-than-usual disbursements
of individual tax refunds. Data on individual refunds are now
available through March 20; they show an increase of $4.3 billion
relative to the comparable period of 1991. The speed-up
reflects in part the greater use of electronic filing, but its
effect on cash in the hands of consumers is not so clear. If
electronic filing were not available, then some taxpayers might have
taken out loans against their expected tax refunds as they have done
in past years. 10
Two minor measures to boost disposable income were implemented
recently: reduced withholding of taxes and extended unemployment
benefits. The new withholding tables recently issued to employers
by the IRS are effective for wages paid after February 1992 and
will, according to Treasury estimates, lower withheld taxes
$2 billion each month starting in March; net final tax settlements
(tax payments minus refunds) during the next tax-filing season will
9. The data from the Monthly Treasury Statements shown in the
table exaggerate the increase in refunds this year. The bulk of
refunds are mailed on Fridays, and the January-February period this
year included an additional Friday.
10. In any event, this year's change in the pattern of refund
issuance will not affect the monthly pattern of disposable income
that is reported by BEA. Analysts at BEA have indicated that they
interpret this year's faster issuance of refunds as a part of an
ongoing secular trend, and that the change will not affect
seasonally adjusted disposable income estimates.

increase by a corresponding amount. 11 The timing of the change
implies that, on net, cumulative federal tax receipts will be about
$20 billion lower during calendar year 1992 and $4 billion lower
during calendar year 1993. For calendar and fiscal years beginning
in 1994, lower withholding of taxes will be approximately offset by
higher net final tax settlements.
On February 7, the President signed into law a second extension
of unemployment benefits. The law offers an additional
thirteen weeks of compensation for unemployed workers who exhaust
their twenty-six weeks of state benefits and then exhaust the
thirteen to twenty weeks of extended federal benefits enacted late
last year. The bill is estimated to cost $2.7 billion in fiscal
year 1992; it is "financed" out of the $2.2 billion surplus from
last year's pay-as-you-go legislation and from an acceleration of
estimated corporate tax payments.
Regarding other budgetary actions, the Congress passed a tax
bill on March 20, which the President quickly vetoed. In addition,
the House has approved a budget resolution for fiscal year 1993 that
cuts defense expenditures $10 billion more than is required by the
1990 budget agreement; the President has proposed reducing defense
expenditures $5 billion more than in the 1990 agreement. The
resolution also includes a complicated provision that would allow
the House to vote to relax some of the features of the 1990 budget
agreement and shift some of the defense savings to discretionary
domestic programs; at this time the outcome of such a vote is far
from certain.
State and Local Government Sector
Incoming data indicate that real purchases of goods and
services by state and local governments fell early this year, as the
11. The Treasury estimates anticipated that some taxpayers would
file new W-4 forms to retain their previous levels of withholding.

weakened financial position of many of these governments continued
to restrain spending. Employment by state and local governments
edged down in January and February, and real construction put-in-
place dropped back in January (chart). Since its peak in the fourth
quarter of 1990, most of the cuts in construction spending have been
in the building of highways, roads, and bridges.
A recent survey of the most populous counties in the United
States, representing 44 percent of the U.S. population, provides
additional evidence of cutbacks in spending on infrastructure
projects. Seventy percent of the respondents have delayed highway
projects, and a much smaller--but still sizable--portion have put
other types of capital projects, such as jails and sewer facilities,
on hold. In addition, nearly 80 percent of survey respondents have
had to cut services, employment, or both, in order to offset a
potential budget gap. Looking ahead, many respondents anticipate
continuing budgetary pressures owing to further cutbacks in state
aid and reduced property tax collections from lower assessments.
Prices and Wages
Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in February, after rising only
0.1 percent in January. Food prices turned up last month, and the
decline in energy prices slowed. For items other than food and
energy, prices were up 0.4 percent in February, a bit more than in
recent months.
However, the underlying trend in prices continued to moderate
in the early part of this year. As measured by the CPI excluding
food and energy, the twelve-month change in prices slowed to
3-3/4 percent in February from the 5-1/2 percent pace posted over
the preceding year. This marked deceleration overstates the
restraining influence of slack in labor and product markets because,
in the year ended February 1991, prices were boosted by higher

federal excise taxes and by the passthrough of higher oil prices;
even aside from these influences, however, the improvement has been
substantial.
In the food category, the CPI rose 0.3 percent in February,
about reversing the January decline. Since the end of 1990, the
twelve-month rate of change in retail food prices has moved down
from about 5-1/4 percent to 1-1/2 percent, a more marked slowing
than that seen in core inflation. Nearly all of the various food
categories have contributed to this rapid deceleration. Large
increases in the supplies of meats and poultry have pushed the
prices of these products significantly below the levels of a year
ago, and only a small price increase has taken place for fruit and
vegetables over the year. Moreover, the prices of other foods,
which tend to be dominated by the cost of nonfarm inputs, rose only
2-1/2 percent over the twelve months ended in February, about
1 percentage point less than the rise of the previous year.
Energy prices held down the CPI in January and February, as
previous declines in crude oil costs were passed through to the
refinery and retail levels. In addition, warmer-than-expected
weather depressed heating oil prices in December and January. At
this time, private survey data point to relatively small changes in
gasoline prices in early March, and there is little evidence of
pressure on prices from current inventory levels.
Excluding food and energy items, the CPI for goods rose
0.6 percent in February, after a modest advance of 0.2 percent in
January. A jump in apparel prices of about 1-1/2 percent--
reflecting the introduction into the CPI sample of spring and summer
clothing in February rather than March--accounted for about half the

II-39
February increase.12 Large increases also were registered for
pharmaceuticals and for some categories that are not seasonally
adjusted, notably housefurnishings. 13 More generally, however,
the CPI for goods other than food and energy slowed over the past
year, rising 3 percent over the latest twelve-month period,
1 percentage point less than in the preceding year.
The CPI for nonenergy services rose 0.3 percent in February,
after a 0.4 percent rise in January. On a twelve-month basis,
increases in this index have slowed to about 4 percent over the year
ended this February, from a 6-1/2 percent pace during the preceding
year. To some extent, this deceleration owes to the sharp decline
in auto finance charges last year and to a reduction in airfares,
which have tended to follow the path of fuel costs. However,
slowing is evident in other services as well, most notably in the
shelter component. Shelter, which accounts for more than half of
the nonenergy services category, rose only about 3-1/2 percent over
the latest twelve-month period, compared with an increase of nearly
6 percent over the preceding twelve months.
Turning to recent developments that will affect consumer prices
in March, three Japanese motor vehicle manufacturers increased
prices on March 13. Prices of Toyotas were raised an average of
3.2 percent, while price increases for Nissan and Honda models were
3.0 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively; there were relatively
larger price hikes for Toyota's high-priced Lexus models and for
Nissan's Infiniti models. Although these higher prices should begin
12. Although the BLS has improved its seasonal adjustment
procedures, the adjustment factors for apparel do not yet appear
fully consistent with the early introduction of seasonal clothing
into the CPI sample (started two years ago). This inconsistency
affects the index mainly in February and August.
13. In previous years, problems with seasonal adjustment have
tended to boost the CPI in January and February. This effect was
less evident in January of this year, in part reflecting changes in
the BLS adjustment procedures.

to show up in the CPI for new vehicles in March, they probably will
affect the index in April and May as well, owing to lags in dealer
pricing and CPI pricing methods. Over the March-to-May period, the
increases are likely to boost the CPI new car index--which has a
weight of about 4 percent in the total CPI--by roughly
1/2 percent. 14 Of course, much larger effects would be felt if
domestic carmakers were to follow suit.
At the producer level, the PPI for finished goods excluding
food and energy rose 0.1 percent in February, after a 0.3 percent
increase in January. The index was boosted in January and held down
in February by a swing in prices of passenger cars.15 On balance.
the PPI for consumer goods other than food and energy was up nearly
3 percent at an annual rate over the past six months. In contrast,
prices of capital equipment have risen only about 1-3/4 percent at
an annual rate over the past half year, restrained by weak demand
for capital equipment, declining prices of computers, and
competition from imported equipment.
The PPI's for intermediate and crude materials (nonfood,
nonenergy) both turned up in February, after declining during most
of the past year. At the intermediate level, the increase was
0.4 percent, with a marked rebound in nonferrous metals prices and
further large increases in prices for lumber and plywood. At the
crude materials level, the index rose 1.4 percent, reflecting sharp
increases in prices for nonferrous metal scrap. Despite the
February increases, however, the PPIs for intermediate and crude
14. The PPI for passenger cars is likely to be less affected than
the CPI because the PPI includes only domestically produced
vehicles. In addition, all of the increase in the PPI is likely to
occur in April, because the price increases occurred after the PPI's
March 10 pricing date.
15. On an unadjusted basis, passenger car prices were little
changed in January and fell in February, as automakers offered
additional incentives. The adjustment factors "expected" the
incentives in January, leading to the observed swing in seasonally
adjusted car prices.

materials outside of food and energy registered net declines over
the latest twelve-month period of 0.7 percent and 6.7 percent,
respectively.
Since the last Greenbook, spot prices of industrial materials
generally have firmed a bit. Among particular commodities, prices
of copper and aluminum, which bottomed out around year-end, have
posted additional net gains, and the Journal of Commerce sub-index
for metals has risen about 1-1/2 percent since late January, perhaps
reflecting industrial demand. Prices of lumber products have also
moved higher, reflecting a recovery in the housing sector and supply
constraints associated with protection of the spotted owl in the
Pacific Northwest.16
The most recent data on labor costs indicate that wage
inflation remains moderate. Average hourly earnings of production
or nonsupervisory workers rose 0.3 percent in February, following a
decline of 0.1 percent in January. Over the twelve months ended in
February, hourly earnings rose 2.9 percent, about 1/2 percentage
point less than in the preceding twelve month period. The
deceleration was concentrated in the goods-producing sector,
although wage increases slowed in several service-producing
industries as well.
16. Since the pricing date for the February PPI, plywood prices
have receded somewhat. However, lumber prices climbed further after
the imposition in early March of a 14-1/2 percent temporary duty on
imports from British Columbia, a major supplier.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Market interest rates have risen appreciably since the February
FOMC meeting, even as federal funds have stayed around 4 percent.
Yields on thirty-year Treasury bonds have moved up a little less
than 1/4 percentage point, to just under 8 percent, but the
three-year Treasury rate is up almost 3/4 percentage point and the
one-year rate is up about 1/2 percentage point. A building sense
that a solid economic upturn may be taking shape obviously has
played an important part in this backup in rates; and, because it
also has diminished the perceived risks associated with private
securities, quality spreads have tightened in many cases.
The monetary aggregates jumped in February. However, much of
that surge was in transaction balances and can be traced in part to
the spate of mortgage loan refinancings and earlier-than-normal
disbursements of personal income tax refunds, as well as to previous
declines in market interest rates. Outside of transaction balances,
M2 growth in February was slow, and M3-only components continued to
decline on balance. Preliminary data suggest that growth of the
broader aggregates slackened in early March.
The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors has continued to grow
at a fairly slow pace of late. Business borrowing remains
exceptionally weak, with heavy issuance of securities in the capital
markets reflecting efforts to strengthen balance sheets or to trim
interest costs rather than to meet a need for external finance.
Household borrowing, however, has shown some signs of reviving,
especially in the home mortgage sector where rising real estate
activity and refinancing, which perhaps has occasioned some cashing
out of equity, have buoyed credit demand; total consumer credit
resumed growing in January, as auto loans rose for the first time in
a year, and indications for February suggest that upward momentum

continued last month. Over the first quarter, state and local
governments have issued substantial volumes of new securities, but a
good part of it represents refunding activity rather than net
increments to debt. In contrast, both gross and net borrowing by
the federal government continues very heavy.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 spurted in February to an almost 9-1/2 percent annual rate.
The bulge in M2 growth largely reflected a further acceleration in
Ml, which was boosted last month by continued strength in other
checkable deposits (OCDs) and a surge in demand deposits. Growth in
these components likely was due to the continued relatively low
opportunity cost of holding liquid balances. Some part of the
acceleration in February also may reflect changes in the timing of
individual tax refunds. Demand deposits in January and February
were further supported by a surge in refinancings of mortgages held
in collateral pools for mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by
GNMA or FNMA. Servicers of mortgages in GNMA- and FNMA-guaranteed
MBSs typically retain interest and principal payments (including any
prepayments) in demand deposits before transmitting funds to owners
of the securities. Funds are passed through with a lag of from
fifteen to forty-five days: thus, the recent bulge in mortgage
refinancings and the accompanying liquidation of mortgage pools
likely has provided a temporary boost to the level of demand
deposits (chart).
Apart from strength in MI components, growth of M2 was
bolstered in February by a rebound in the level of retail money
1. Disbursements of individual tax refunds have been running
ahead of refunds over the comparable period last year, partly
because aggregate liabilities slowed along with income growth and
partly because individuals are making greater use of electronic
filing--thereby possibly altering the seasonal pattern of deposit
flows before and after April 15. The staff estimates that the
earlier disbursement of refunds may have boosted M2 by 1/2 to 1
percentage point in February.

market mutual funds, which had been little changed for several
months. Small time deposits continued to run off rapidly, but gains
in savings deposits (including MMDAs) about offset this decline.
Consumers apparently have been lured by still small opportunity
costs involved in holding such accounts and by their usefulness as a
parking place while awaiting higher CD rates. With credit growth
still weak, banks have remained reluctant so far to bid aggressively
for retail CDs, and the spreads between Treasury securities and
rates offered on small time deposits have widened further as market
rates have backed up.
A step-up in M3 growth, to a 7 percent annual rate in February,
mostly reflected the strength of its Ml component. In addition,
institution-only money fund assets accelerated to a nearly
40 percent annual rate in February, as their yields continued to
exceed those on competing assets. Growth in this component also
might reflect some bounce-back from "year-end" effects, when some
institutions drew down their fund balances to take advantage of more
favorable yields elsewhere in credit markets or to show greater
participation in equity markets on their year-end balance sheets.
Large CDs continued to run off in line with the ongoing contraction
in depository balance sheets.
Commercial bankers reportedly are looking more actively for
solid business loan customers, and the recent Survey of Terms of
Business Lending (STBL) for February suggests a small unwinding in
business loan spreads. Rates charged on prime-based loans have
fallen, especially rates for loan sizes over $1 million; since
November, floating rates on prime-based loans dropped
1-1/4 percentage points and fixed rates declined 1 percentage point,
a bit more than the drop in market rates over this period.
Nonetheless, business loans registered another sizable contraction

last month, while total bank credit was about flat. Businesses
apparently used proceeds from capital market offerings to pay down
bank debt as a part of their balance-sheet restructuring. Certain
other categories of bank lending, however, picked up last month.
Real estate loans expanded at a 6-1/2 percent pace--the largest rise
in almost a year--perhaps boosted by loan originations being held in
portfolio instead of being sold at a loss owing to the backup in
rates. In addition, consumer loans grew at a 3-1/2 percent rate,
after adjusting for securitizations, following a small decline in
January.
Securities holdings of banks expanded in January and February,
but at a slower pace than in 1991; this slowdown apparently reflects
small net acquisitions of collateralized mortgage obligations
(CMOs). It also is conceivable that with the surge in mortgage
prepayments, banks have reevaluated the risks associated with such
large exposures to mortgage-related securities.
Data from the most recent call reports for large banks indicate
that asset quality problems may have peaked. Delinquency rates for
most categories of loans fell in the fourth quarter of 1991; C&I
loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans all recorded lower
delinquency rates (chart). Although charge-off rates fell for C&I
loans and consumer loans, they continued to rise for real estate
loans.
Business Finance
As noted, the further decline in business loans at banks in
February and early March was accompanied by sizable financings in
other markets. Public issuance of both bonds and stocks continued
to be very strong, while commercial paper outstanding of
nonfinancial corporations moved up in February and March. Indeed,

activity relatively slow, the staff estimates that nonfinancial
corporations will raise about $50 billion (annual rate) of net new
equity capital during the quarter. In the public bond market, rate
spreads relative to comparable Treasury maturities have continued to
narrow. Even the private placement market is starting to show signs
of becoming more receptive to lower-rated credits than was the case
last year, although the current volume of such financing reportedly
remains small.
The near-record pace of equity issuance thus far in 1992 mainly
reflects a steady flow of large offerings by well-known firms.
Notably, the major auto companies already have raised more than
$2 billion in new equity, adding to the nearly $5 billion they
raised in 1991. In addition, favorable market valuations and the
strong incentives to deleverage have prompted a record volume of
reverse LBOs, most of which involve below-investment-grade firms.
In 1991, below-investment-grade companies issued a record $11.6
billion in new stock, a figure that would be exceeded in 1992 if the
recent pace of issuance continues.
No doubt, the continued high level of share prices has
encouraged new equity issuance. While stock prices, on average,
have edged down about 2 percent since the February FOMC meeting,
several indexes set all-time highs during the period. A number of
traditional measures of equity valuation suggest that the cost of
equity capital is low relative to historical norms, even compared
with the extremes reached in 1987 and some earlier periods. A case
in point is the ratio of current prices to four-quarter trailing
earnings for the S&P 500, which rose to a record 25.8 in late
February. Although sizable one-time earnings write-offs taken
during the past twelve months might exaggerate this measure

somewhat, the ratio likely would still be in the upper reaches of
its historical range if those recent write-offs were excluded.
In February and March, issuance of investment-grade corporate
bonds was heavy, although off a bit from the record pace in January.
The refinancing of high-coupon, callable debt has been the dominant
factor driving corporate bond issuance, despite the recent back-up
in long-term rates that has prompted a few companies to postpone
scheduled offerings. Call volume has been much heavier so far this
year than it was in 1986, a time when long-term rates were at
2similar levels. At current levels of interest rates, the dollar
volume of bond calls during 1992 seems likely to surpass the 1986
record of $40 billion.
The pace of offerings of junk bonds has remained relatively
robust, and some analysts project that gross issuance could total
$20 billion in 1992--about twice the pace of 1991. (However, this
amount would be only half that recorded in 1986, the high-water mark
for junk bonds.) As with the investment-grade sector, the proceeds
from most of the junk bond offerings have been used to pay down
high-cost debt obligations, including both high-coupon bonds and
bank loans. Also, a number of firms have used the proceeds from
equity offerings to retire some of their existing junk bonds. In
general, these refinancings and restructurings have produced
substantial reductions in interest expense, not only because debt
has been replaced with equity, but also because more than half of
the below-investment-grade straight bonds issued in 1992 have had
2. Two features of the current interest rate environment have
diminished the present value of call option features and increased
the incentive to exercise such calls now. First, today's steep
yield curve implies a low probability for more attractive call
opportunities in the future; and second, compared with 1986, recent
interest-rate volatility has been relatively subdued--thereby
generally decreasing the value of retaining the call option.

III-12
coupon yields below 10 percent--several percentage points lower than
the yields on the bonds that were retired.
Although the overall quality of new offerings of junk bonds is
much higher than was true for the takeover-related offerings of the
late 1980s, some recent developments suggest that the market has
begun to be more receptive to lower-quality issues. BB-rated
companies still dominate the current new issue calendar, but the
number of B-rated offerings has increased. Also, offerings of bonds
that have subordinate rankings in the issuers' capital structures
have become increasingly common. Finally, issuance last year tended
to be dominated by firms in the consumer goods sector, such as RJR
and Duracell; recently, more cyclically sensitive companies--
including home builders, cable companies, computer firms, and oil
companies--have reentered the primary market.
In the private placement market, recently available data
indicate that nonfinancial firms issued only $44 billion of debt
securities in 1991, down from gross issuance of $55 billion in 1990
and $82 billion in 1989. This drop-off reflects the combined
effects of a reduction in borrowing by firms to finance takeovers
and a general decline in purchases of private placements by ESOPs.
In addition, the falloff in placements was especially steep for the
below-investment-grade sector, as life insurance companies limited
their overall acquisitions of lower-rated securities.
The capital markets also have become more receptive to
offerings by financial firms. In the past two months, insurance
companies--including Travelers, CIGNA, and Aetna--have raised equity
through private placements and improved their balance sheets through
divestitures of financial assets. Debt offerings by auto finance
companies have enjoyed somewhat narrower yield spreads this year,
apparently also reflecting the benefits of balance-sheet

III-13
restructuring through equity issuance by their parent companies.
Yield spreads on bonds issued by banks have continued to narrow, and
bank holding companies have floated nearly $3 billion in equity so
far in 1992--including a $1.6 billion issue by Chemical Banking
Corporation. The improvement in yield spreads apparently has
prompted banks to begin funding more loan assets on their own
balance sheets. As a result, issuance of bonds secured by
receivables has slowed somewhat in 1992, even though yield spreads
on these asset-backed securities have narrowed.
There have been other signs that financial stress is
diminishing. The number of newly reported business failures and
bankruptcies remains large, but appears to have leveled off
recently. Defaults on corporate bonds, although still high by
historical standards, seem likely to begin receding from the record
$18 billion annual volumes of 1990 and 1991. Although downgrades of
bonds are still outnumbering upgrades, the differential has been
shrinking, and a number of highly-leveraged firms appear poised to
regain investment-grade status within the next year or two. And,
although the number of increases in dividend payments has not
changed much in the past few months, the number of decreases in
dividend payments has declined noticeably from the record pace of
early 1991.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
With the Treasury drawing heavily on cash balances, net
borrowing by the federal government during the first quarter is
expected to be down slightly from the fourth quarter level, despite
a sizable increase in the deficit, not seasonally adjusted. Gross
3. Nonetheless, General Motors and GMAC bonds were downgraded by
S&P in March, and GMAC's commercial paper is currently under review.
4. In addition, lingering concern over the possibility of a cap
on credit-card interest rates probably has somewhat discouraged
issuance of bonds backed by credit-card receivables.

Treasury auction sizes have increased sharply, and further increases
are likely over the spring. Weekly bill offerings have risen from
$20.4 billion to $22.8 billion, while the sizes of short-term note
issues had increases ranging from $500 million to $1-1/4 billion.
In a modest attempt to shorten the maturity of its debt, the
Treasury trimmed its ten- and thirty-year issues by $1 billion and
$2 billion, respectively, in the first quarter. However, there was
little market reaction to the change, and the cutback in longer
maturities had no discernible effect on the Treasury yield curve.
In the market for agency issues, almost half the sizable
paydown of debt outstanding of all government-sponsored enterprises
(GSE) in January was reversed by the Federal National Mortgage
Association's issuance of securities in February. Since the last
FOMC meeting, spreads on newly issued GSE debt generally have
widened.
On March 6, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
announced that it plans to sell at least $500 million of preferred
stock, in order to bolster the firm's capital and to meet current
and proposed regulatory standards. Freddie Mac also said that it
will boost the percentage of whole mortgages in its portfolio--
increasing the share from the current 5 percent to 10 percent of
total assets over the next five years--and will finance these new
mortgage holdings in part with callable debt. Thus far, however,
there appears to have been little market enthusiasm for GSE callable
debt, and sales of the Freddie Mac securities have gone rather
slowly.
Municipal Securities
Gross offerings of long-term municipal bonds in March likely
will be a bit above the robust pace of issuance recorded in
February. Refunding activity has been heavy in both months, and

III-16
refunding during the first quarter may exceed $16 billion--the
largest volume in any quarter since early 1987. Funds from the
recent refundings evidently are being used to retire callable debt
issues immediately, unlike in some earlier periods when outstanding
(but not-yet-callable) debt issues were often defeased through
advance refundings; in the first two months of 1992, less than
$3 billion in Treasury-issued SLGS were sold to state and local
governments.5

Much of the investor demand for tax-exempt securities in the
past year has been funneled through mutual funds. Inflows to both
open-end and new closed-end tax-exempt mutual funds rose throughout
1991, with investors apparently shifting out of money market funds
and other short-term instruments. Net flows to open-end municipal
5. SLGS are Treasury securities whose yields are tied to
tax-exempt rates. SLGS are sold to tax-exempt issuers of advance
refunding bonds to provide them with an investment instrument that
does not violate arbitrage restrictions for tax-exempt sales
proceeds. The proceeds from a refunding sale also can be invested
in other types of securities; however, for nearly all refunding
issues over $5 million, any arbitrage profits must be rebated to the
U.S. Treasury. Market observers have indicated that the strict and
complicated rebate provisions currently force municipal issuers to
use virtually all the proceeds from advance refunding issues to
purchase SLGS.

III-17
bond funds were $26 billion last year, roughly 3/4 of net new
tax-exempt debt, and early indications point to a continuation of
heavy bond-fund purchases in 1992. Also, sales of shares by closed-
end municipal bond funds and unit investment trusts were strong last
year and reportedly have been strong again early this year.
Financial stress in the state and local government sector does
not appear to be abating. A recent report by the National Council
of State Legislatures indicates that more than half the states are
experiencing significant spending overruns on entitlement programs,
and Moody's has warned of additional credit-rating downgrades in
1992. Moody's recently downgraded California's bond rating to Aal
from Aaa, citing two consecutive years of operating deficits and an
apparent lack of political will to reduce its widening budget gap
for fiscal 1992. Budget difficulties also have stymied New York
State's effort to end its reliance on short-term debt to finance its
accumulated deficit. In 1989, the state began to replace its short-
term debt with long-term bonds, but the accumulated deficit has
risen by another $2 billion since then. As a result, almost
$4 billion of short-term borrowing to cover deficits is expected by
New York State this spring, nearly the same amount it borrowed in
the previous two springs.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage interest rates have continued to trend upward over the
intermeeting period, in tandem with other market interest rates.
Contract rates on conventional fixed-rate mortgages have increased
about 35 basis points since the end of January and about 80 basis
points since their January lows. Spreads over Treasuries remain
fairly tight, perhaps in part because the backup in mortgage rates
is seen as damping repayments. In response to the increase in
market rates, the ceiling rate on VA-guaranteed loans also was

raised to 8-1/2 percent in late February--up 1/2 percentage point
from the rate established in late December. Although the initial
rate advantage of adjustable-rate mortgages has remained
appreciable, at a little under 3 percentage points, ARMs have
accounted for less than 20 percent of mortgage loan originations in
recent months.
Despite the recent increase in interest rates, mortgage
borrowing appears to have been picking up. As noted above, real
estate loans at commercial banks rose at about a 6-1/2 percent
annual rate in February, and preliminary data for March suggest
further growth. Staff estimates that the volume of mortgage-backed
securities issuance also remained strong in February (table). In
addition, the Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly survey
indicates that applications for loans to purchase homes remain at a
level about 40 percent above the fourth-quarter pace (chart).
The back-up in mortgage interest rates since late January has
damped refinancing activity (chart). Anecdotal reports suggest that
the decline in applications also reflects in part efforts by some
lenders to intentionally discourage refinancings. Even so,
refinancings continue to account for about 40 percent of total loan
applications at mortgage companies surveyed by the MBA.
Home mortgage delinquency rates declined in the fourth quarter
of last year. The percent of FHA-insured loans thirty days or more
past due fell in the fourth quarter to 7.10 percent, while the
past-due rate on conventional loans was little changed from its much
lower 3.14 percent third-quarter rate. Moreover, mortgages that are
past due sixty days or more (a measure of more serious payment
problems) fell 0.11 percentage point in the fourth quarter, to
1.56 percent.

Consumer Credit
Overall consumer credit outstanding moved up in January, after
declining over most of last year. Its automobile component
registered its first increase in more than a year--edging up at a
1-1/2 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate, compared with a
6 percent decline for 1991 as a whole. Revolving credit also grew
modestly. (Caution is warranted, however, when interpreting
revolving credit in January and in December, because this component
exhibits highly irregular variation in those two months.) Given the
pickup in consumer loans at banks in February and the strength in
retail sales so far this year, it seems likely that consumer
installment credit increased somewhat in February.
The decline of nearly 1 percent in total installment debt for
1991, along with slow growth relative to income the year before, has
reduced the debt-service burdens of consumers. Installment debt
outstanding relative to disposable personal income, for example,
declined to 17 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, compared
with a high of 18-1/2 percent in 1989. Moreover, scheduled payments
of principal and interest relative to income are estimated to have
declined from about 11 percent to 10-1/2 percent over the same
period.
The latest information on consumer loan delinquency rates also
points to reduced debt-management problems for households.
According to the American Bankers Association, the delinquency rate
on closed-end consumer loans at banks dropped fairly sharply during
the fourth quarter, with large declines occurring in the auto loan
category (chart). Also, auto loan delinquencies declined further at
captive auto finance companies.
With repayment experience apparently improving, lenders may
become more ready to extend credit to households. In the October

and January Surveys of Senior Loan Officers, there was some rise in
the number of banks expressing increased willingness to lend to
consumers, and none reported reduced willingness to lend. An index
of relative willingness to lend, based on the difference between
numbers of banks more willing versus those less willing to lend,
dropped into negative territory only briefly early last year and
since has been moderately positive (chart).
Interest rates on consumer loans at banks continued to decline,
although such declines failed to match the reductions in bank
funding costs. New-car loan rates in early February were about
2-1/2 percentage points below levels prevailing in the spring of
1989. At just under 10 percent, these rates were at their lowest
level since May 1972. There may be room for some further decline in
auto loan rates, insofar as their recent spreads of around 400 basis
points above yields on Treasury securities of comparable maturity
are relatively high--the historical average for this spread is about
300 basis points.
The average rate on credit card balances declined
0.10 percentage point between the November and February surveys,
putting this measure at 18.09 percent, little below its 1991
average. Other evidence makes clear, however, that competitive
forces are making lower rates more widely available to consumers
today than at any time in the past. In recent months, many banks
also have discontinued charging annual fees. In addition, major
credit card issuers are increasingly segmenting the market by
offering a variety of plans to certain groups of customers, plans
that generally involve lower rates than on the issuers' regular
plans. Credit risk, account activity, and use of other banking
services have been the criteria for deciding to whom to offer these

lowering of rates through market segmentation because it

hierarchy of rates for different classes of cardholders: 17.8

"preferred" subset of the latter group. In February, American
Express announced a new pricing structure for its Optima card based
on both payment record and account use. Under the new structure,
Optima charges 12.5 percent for cardholders of one year or longer
who spend at least $1,000 and have made no late payments during the
preceding 12 months. Cardholders who are in good standing but fail
to meet the spending or one-year tenure requirements are assessed
14.75 percent. Card members with late payments on their record
within the past twelve months pay 18.75 percent.

The decline in imports in January relative to the average level
in the last three months of 1991 was in oil, which declined $0.4
billion, and in consumer goods, which declined $0.5 billion. Over
the same period, imports of industrial supplies increased slightly
while imports of both capital goods and automotive products were
essentially unchanged. The decline in exports in January compared
with the average rate in the fourth quarter was concentrated in
aircraft and automotive products, down almost $0.5 billion each;
exports of industrial supplies rose $0.3 billion.

Between the third and the fourth quarter of 1991, the
merchandise trade deficit improved nearly $9 billion at an annual
rate. Exports grew 16 percent at an annual rate in the fourth
quarter, led by large increases in shipments of aircraft and other
capital equipment, and slightly smaller increases in exports of
consumer goods and agricultural products. Non-oil imports grew 10
percent, led almost entirely by a large (42 percent at an annual
rate) increase in imports of consumer goods. Some of these imports
may have ended up in retail inventories, in light of the decline in
total domestic expenditure in the fourth quarter. The decline in
imports of consumer goods in January (to about the average level of
the third quarter of 1991) may suggest that these inventories were
being worked off earlier this year. In addition, some of the surge
in consumer imports in the fourth quarter was in apparel from China,
possibly stimulated by expectations that most favored nation status
for China would not be renewed.
The value of imported oil in January was 9 percent less than
December as a sharp drop in price swamped a small increase in the
quantity of oil imports. Preliminary DOE data suggest that weak
economic activity, mild weather and a large drawdown in stocks
combined to hold down the quantity of imports in January. Except
for the stock drawdown, these factors appear to have also held down
imports in February.

After falling rapidly between their mid-October peak and
November, spot oil prices fluctuated between $18 and $20 dollars per
barrel from December through early February. Following the
relatively unsuccessful mid-February OPEC ministerial meeting, at
which no individual quotas were assigned, spot prices dipped roughly
$1.50 per barrel. Through the middle of March, prices have recouped
roughly $1 of this decline on signs of an increase in global
economic activity. Given shipping and contract lags, prices of
imported oil declined through January and probably will show little
change through March.
Prices of Exports and Non-oil Imports
Prices of non-oil imports accelerated in January, after having
risen 4 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. The
increases in January were largest for capital goods and non-oil
industrial supplies. The price increases for capital goods
continued a trend that began in the fourth quarter of 1991, and
reversed the declines recorded in the previous two quarters. The
decline in the price index for automotive products in January was
for the second consecutive month and followed a run-up of prices in
the fall with the introduction of new models. Data for February
will be released March 26 and will be included in the Greenbook
Supplement.
In the fourth quarter of 1991, fixed-weight (NIPA) prices of
non-oil imports rose 2-1/2 percent (AR) from the third quarter
level. Price increases of 5-7 percent (annual rate) for consumer
goods, automotive products, and capital goods, generally reversed
the declines in the previous two quarters that had been associated
in part with an appreciating dollar. On the other hand, prices of
non-oil industrial supplies fell in the fourth quarter -- the fourth
consecutive quarter of decline. Averaging over all commodities,

prices of non-oil imports were about the same in 1991-Q4 as a year
earlier.
Prices of U.S. exports declined in January for the second month
in a row. While the declines in January were largely in
agricultural products, decreases were also recorded in industrial
supplies, especially fuels. Slight increases in the prices of
capital goods, consumer goods, and automotive products partially
offset these declines.
In the fourth quarter, fixed-weight (NIPA) prices of U.S.
exports rose at a 2-1/2 percent annual rate. The price of
agricultural exports jumped 11 percent (AR) while prices of exported
capital, consumer, and automotive products rose more moderately. In
contrast, prices of exported industrial supplies declined for the
fourth consecutive quarter. As in the case for non-oil imports,
average export prices were about the same in the fourth quarter of
1991 as a year earlier.
U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account balance fell to a deficit of $41.1
billion at seasonally adjusted annual rates in the fourth quarter,
slightly lower than the deficit of $46.5 billion (revised) in the
third quarter. This small improvement came as a narrowing in the
merchandise trade deficit and a reduction in unilateral transfer
payments more than offset a weakening in net receipts from services
and investment income.
Merchandise exports grew more than merchandise imports in the
fourth quarter, and U.S. grant payments for debt forgiveness dropped
back to near zero from a level of $15.6 billion in the third
quarter. For service transactions, payments increased more than
receipts, especially for travel.

IV-7
Net investment income receipts fell to near zero in the fourth
quarter. While much of the decline reflected net capital losses on
direct investments there was also a small decrease in net portfolio
income receipts. This decline in portfolio income receipts is
attributable to a seasonal pattern induced by semi-annual coupon
payments which have not been filtered from the data. Without this
seasonal effect, the general decline in dollar interest rates would
have reduced net payments despite a deterioration in the net
portfolio position.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Banks reported only small capital inflows in December and
January (line 1 of the Summary Table of U.S. International
Transactions), despite substantial inflows through interbank
transactions. This pattern was evident throughout the fourth
quarter when banks reported a small outflow even though agencies and
branches of foreign banks decreased their net claims on own foreign
offices by $23 billion on a monthly average basis (line 1b of the
International Banking Data Table).
Foreign net purchases of corporate and agency bonds remained
strong in December (line 2a of the Summary Table), bringing the
total for the quarter to $7 billion and the total for the year to
$26 billion. These large purchases coincided with exceptionally
strong new issue volume in the domestic market and very high levels
of new Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations. A large part--almost
$9 billion--of these net purchases were in agency bonds. In
contrast to the large bond purchases, foreigners on net sold $2-1/2
billion of U.S. stocks in December (line 2b), reducing net purchases
for the year to $10 billion. Although these stock purchases were
relatively small, they contrast with net sales of almost $14 billion
in 1990.
U.S. residents continued to acquire foreign securities at a
rapid pace in December (line 2c), bringing the outflow for the
quarter to almost $12 billion and for the year to $47 billion.
About three-quarters of the net outflow for the year was to Europe.
Elsewhere there were large net purchases in Canada and Japan, and
net sales in the rest of Asia. Roughly two-thirds of the outflow
was in the form of U.S. purchases of foreign stocks. U.S. residents
1. This figure is much lower than that recently reported in the press
which reflected gross, rather than net, purchases.

were particularly active in the Japanese stock market where they
recorded net purchases of $13 billion.
Foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities picked up in
December to $2 billion (line 3), bringing the net purchases for the
year to $17-1/2 billion. Japanese residents on net sold $1 billion
in Treasuries in December, reducing their net purchases for the year
to about $3 billion.
These trends in private securities transactions generally
continued into January. Foreigners continued to acquire U.S.
Treasury, corporate, and agency bonds at a rapid pace while reducing
their holding of U.S. stocks. U.S. residents' acquisition of
foreign securities accelerated slightly in January with most of the
acquisitions coming in the form of stocks. One notable change from
the earlier pattern is that U.S. residents reduced their holding of
Japanese stocks in January, recording the first monthly decline in
over a year. U.S. residents also reduced their holding of Japanese
bonds by almost $1-1/2 billion.
Official transactions recorded a net reduction in foreign
holdings in the United States of $2 billion in December (line 4),
all of which is attributable to declines in G-10 holdings. For 1991
as a whole, official capital registered an inflow of $20 billion, as
sizable reductions by G-10 and OPEC countries were more than offset
by a $40 billion inflow from other countries. More than three-
quarters of this inflow is attributable to Spain, Taiwan, and
Mexico. In January there were large inflows from official sources,
most of which was attributable to Taiwan and the BIS. Partial data
from the FRBNY indicate small official capital inflows in February.
U.S. direct investment abroad continued at a rapid pace in the
fourth quarter, reaching almost $9 billion. For the year, U.S.
direct investment abroad totaled almost $30 billion, slightly less

IV-12
than in 1990. About one-half of the investment was in Western
Europe as U.S. companies continue to position themselves in advance
of EC 1992. Additionally, U.S. firms invested substantial sums in
Latin America, in part through participation in the privatization of
previously state-owned enterprises such as the $1 billion investment
GTE and ATT made in Telefono de Venezuela.
Foreign direct investment in the United States declined further
in the fourth quarter to $4 billion, bringing the total for the year
to $22 billion (line 7). This compares with a $37 billion inflow in
1990. Nearly all of the decline from 1990 can be attributed to a
decline in direct investment from Japan, which fell from $17 billion
to $4 billion. More generally, foreign acquisitions in the United
States declined substantially in 1991.
The statistical discrepancy was virtually zero in the fourth
quarter, bringing the discrepancy for the year to a negative $3
billion. This is a marked change from the positive $63 billion
discrepancy recorded in 1990. These wide swings in the discrepancy
from year to year are most likely the result of errors and omissions
in the recording of capital flows rather than current account
transactions. Changes in recorded capital flows in periods when
there are wide swings in the discrepancy should be interpreted with
caution.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign-exchange value of the dollar,
shown in the chart, has increased by about 4 percent since the
February 4 FOMC meeting. The dollar initially declined on
expectations of further Federal Reserve easing. This view gained
support after the release on February 7 of nonfarm payroll figures
for January, which were somewhat weaker than expected by the market.

IV-13
Later, however, the dollar appreciated as expectations of a near-
term Federal Reserve easing were reduced following the release of
stronger-than-expected U.S. data on retail sales, car sales, and
initial jobless claims. Following a pause at the end of February,
the dollar resumed its appreciation as the March purchasing
managers' report confirmed the view that the U.S. economic recovery
may be taking hold. Late in the intermeeting period the dollar
retreated somewhat, despite further indications that the U.S.
recovery is underway. Contributing to this retreat was a tightening
of money market conditions in Germany, where monetary growth
continued quite rapid and concerns over wage pressures intensified.
The dollar's movement against the German mark mirrored the
weighted average dollar's movement, rising nearly 4 percent. The
dollar appreciated against the Japanese yen by nearly 6 percent over
the period. Throughout the period, the market has expected the Bank
of Japan to announce an official discount rate cut ranging from 1/2
percent to 1 percent. The Tankan survey's diffusion index of
business conditions moved into negative territory for the first time
since 1987, suggesting that economic prospects continue to weaken in
Japan. During this intermeeting period the Bank of Japan intervened
several times to support the yen at various levels. On two
occasions the U.S. monetary authorities joined this intervention
initiative to sell a total of $150 million.
The net movement in long-term interest rate differentials over
the period was in favor of the dollar. The U.S. 10-year bond yield
increased by more than 20 basis points since February 4, while
German bellwether bond yields increased by more than 10 basis points
and Japanese bellwether bond yields declined by about 10 basis
points. Changes in short-term interest rate differentials have been
mixed. German call money rates, on balance, were unchanged. German

three-month rates have risen by 20 basis points, a little less than
those in the United States. In contrast, Japanese three-month
interest rates have declined by more than 25 basis points,
reflecting the anticipated official discount rate cut.
Persistent political and financial market scandals, the effects
of fiscal year-end positioning, and the continued weakening outlook
for economic activity and corporate profits in Japan combined to
drive the Japanese stock market sharply lower. The Nikkei index
dropped below 20,000 during the intermeeting period, but regained
some of its losses by the end of the period. Both the Nikkei and
the wider Topix index declined by more than 8 percent, on balance.
The U.K. stock market declined by more than 4 percent, after the
announcement of the U.K. budget and the April 9 date for the general
election.
In the middle of the intermeeting period, the Swiss franc began
a steady decline against the mark. Initially, the Swiss authorities
appeared willing to accept some depreciation of the Swiss franc
against the mark, allowing them to direct their monetary policy
towards improving the weakening domestic economic conditions. When
the franc's depreciation continued, however, the Swiss National Bank
more than reversed its earlier easing of money market conditions in
an effort to stabilize the currency.
On balance, the Swiss
franc depreciated by nearly 2 percent against the mark over the
intermeeting period.
The Canadian dollar weakened by nearly 1 percent against the
U.S. dollar since the February FOMC. There have been concerns over
the political status of Quebec, as well as rumors that financial
difficulties of a large Canadian real estate firm might spill over

IV-16
to the banking system.
Canadian 3-month interest
rates and long-term interest rates rose by over 35 basis points over
the intermeeting period.
The United States intervened on two
occasions, the first of which was for Treasury account only. U.S.
intervention totaled $150 million dollars, $125 million for Treasury
and $25 million for the System.
The price of gold declined by nearly 5 percent over the period.
There were some market reports that former Soviet republics have
been selling large quantities of gold through German banks.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Newly available national accounts data confirm that growth
weakened in most major foreign industrial countries in the fourth
quarter of 1991. Real output declined in Japan, Germany, the United
Kingdom, and Canada, while French marketable GDP was unchanged.
Data from the first quarter show some signs of recovery in
continental Europe but continued weakness in Japan, Britain, and
Canada.
Recent price data show measured inflation rates that are on
average little changed. Strong wage pressures persist in Germany
and the United Kingdom, despite slower activity and rising British
unemployment. Soft raw materials prices in 1991 caused decreases in
consumer-price inflation in the major industrial countries that
overstated progress in reducing underlying inflation, which has come
down more slowly.

IV-20
The ruling Socialist party fared poorly in French local and
regional elections held March 22. National elections will be held
in both Italy and Britain in early April.
Individual country notes. In Japan, fourth-quarter real total
domestic demand (s.a.a.r.) fell 2.1 percent, but unusual strength in
the external sector limited the decrease in GNP to 0.2 percent, as
exports rose 6.3 percent and imports fell 4.7 percent. Consumption
edged up 0.4 percent, investment in plant and equipment dropped 2.5
percent, and residential construction plunged 18.4 percent. Largely
because of a sharp reduction in government rice holdings,
inventories made a 1.3 percent negative contribution to growth.
Recent monthly indicators have also been generally weak. New
machinery orders (s.a.) plummeted 13.1 percent in December,
industrial production (s.a.) declined by 0.8 percent in January, and
new passenger car registrations (s.a.) were down 5.6 percent in
February. In contrast, housing starts (s.a.) rose 5.9 percent in
January. The Bank of Japan's diffusion index, a measure of current
business confidence at major manufacturing firms, dropped steeply in
February to its lowest level since 1987. The unemployment rate
(s.a.) was unchanged in January at 2.1 percent, but the ratio of job
offers to applicants (s.a.), a more sensitive indicator of labor
market conditions, declined 2.3 percent to a level 12.9 percent
below its peak in March 1991.
Inflationary pressures have remained low. Consumer prices in
the Tokyo area recorded a 12-month increase of only 2.2 percent in
February. Excluding prices of perishable foods, which have fallen
in recent months, 12-month consumer-price inflation has remained
virtually constant at 2.4 percent since November 1991. Wholesale
prices dropped 1.6 percent from February 1991 to February 1992.

IV-21
In February, M2 plus CD's (s.a.) contracted for the third
consecutive month, reflecting slower loan growth and shifts in asset
holdings out of bank deposits, and reducing 12-month money growth to
1.6 percent.
The merchandise trade surplus (s.a.) increased to $10.4 billion
in February, the highest monthly surplus on record. Exports (s.a.)
were up 1.3 percent from January, and imports fell 8.4 percent.
West Germany's GNP, adjusted for seasonal effects and
variations in the number of working days, fell at an annual rate of
1.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Domestic demand grew 2.9
percent, with a 2.5 percent increase in private consumption. Real
net exports were off sharply as west German imports grew 5 percent,
due in part to a surge in foreign travel, while exports were
essentially unchanged. It appears that a failure of seasonal
adjustment of output in the fourth quarter to account for the effect
of extra holiday leave-taking may have contributed to the decline in
measured output.
Monthly indicators continue to present a mixed picture.
Industrial production (s.a.) in western Germany increased 5.9
percent in January, after falling a revised 4.2 percent in December.
Construction activity was particularly strong -- up 8.5 percent in
January -- due in part to mild weather. The residual seasonal
effect mentioned above appears to account for much of December's
decline and January's rebound. The volume of new orders for west
German manufactured goods (s.a.) also swung sharply, falling 2.5
percent in December and increasing 2.7 percent in January. Total
orders in December and January were down 1 percent from the previous
two months taken together.
Despite the output contraction of the past three quarters, no
slack has emerged in west German labor markets. The west German

IV-22
unemployment rate (s.a.) was 6.3 percent in January and February,
and has remained between 6.2 percent and 6.4 percent since the
beginning of 1991. Partly because of labor agreements that mandate
reductions in weekly hours, west German employment (s.a.) has
remained relatively strong, increasing 0.8 percent in the second
half of 1991.
In eastern Germany, the unemployment rate (n.s.a.) fell 0.6
percentage points in February to 16.4 percent, while the number of
workers on short-time was unchanged at 6.6 percent. Industrial
production (n.s.a.) increased 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter of
1991. Investment intention surveys suggest that gross fixed
investment will rise about 30 percent this year, and other surveys
continue to show growing optimism about business conditions.
Consumer prices (s.a.) in western Germany rose 0.5 percent in
February after no change in January, raising twelve-month inflation
to 4.3 percent. West German producer prices (n.s.a.) were up 0.3
percent in February, lifting twelve-month WPI inflation to 2.0
percent.
Negotiations over wage agreements for 1992 continue to be a
source of uncertainty. In the banking sector, wage negotiations are
deadlocked, although recent public statements by bank management and
union officials suggest some potential for compromise. Negotiations
involving public sector employees are also at an impasse.
The pan-German current account deficit (n.s.a.) widened from
$1.1 billion to $4.1 billion in January, as exports (n.s.a.) fell
0.6 percent and imports increased 6.4 percent.
German M3 was 8.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) above its 1991-Q4 average
in February, compared with 9 percent in January. The recent growth
of M3 reflects continued rapid expansion of currency, demand
deposits, and bank lending.

IV-23
The recent dispute over the government's 1993 tax package has
been resolved, with the Bundesrat approving the government's
proposals with only minor changes. The main components of this
legislation are a 1 percentage point increase in the VAT rate and
the elimination of some business taxes.
In France, real marketable GDP (s.a.a.r.) was unchanged in the
fourth quarter, after rising 2 percent in the previous quarter.
Consumption growth of 2.8 percent was offset by a decline in
investment of 2.4 percent and a substantial drop in inventories.
Marketable GDP excludes most government services and is a good
preliminary indicator of total real GDP.
Monthly indicators for January and February point to a recovery
in activity in the first quarter. Industrial production (s.a.) rose
1.9 percent in January, following a modest decline in the fourth
quarter. Consumption of manufactured products (s.a.) increased 3
percent in January and 1.2 percent in February. The INSEE monthly
survey of French industry for February showed a strong increase in
orders, and firms also indicated they intended to increase
production over the next few months. Retail sales (s.a.) increased
sharply in January but declined slightly in February. The
unemployment rate was unchanged in January at 9.8 percent.
Inflationary pressures continued to be moderate. The consumer
price index in February was 3.0 percent above its level a year
earlier, up slightly from the 2.9 percent increase registered in
January. The quarterly survey of hourly wages, conducted in
January, showed an increase in wages of 4.0 percent (n.s.a.a.r.),
down from the 4.5 percent increase one quarter earlier.
The trade balance (s.a.) registered small surpluses in January
and February, following a small surplus in the fourth quarter of
1991, reflecting strong export growth.

IV-24
The Ministry of Finance announced that the final budget deficit
for 1991 was FF132 billion (1.9 percent of GDP). Weaker than
expected economic activity caused the deficit to exceed the
Ministry's previous estimate by 30 percent.
In regional elections held March 22, the governing Socialist
Party won 18.3 percent of the vote, down from 30 percent in 1986.
Support for the mainstream parties together dropped from roughly 70
percent to 50 percent. The main beneficiaries were the extreme
right-wing National Front, and the two "Green" parties. In part,
the results reflect dissatisfaction with the mainstream parties'
failure to address France's unemployment and immigration issues.
In Italy, the economy has continued to grow sluggishly. In the
third quarter of 1991, GDP (s.a.a.r.) grew 0.4 percent. Industrial
production (s.a.) rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, following
two quarters of declines. Consumer confidence slumped in the fourth
quarter, but increased in January to its highest level since last
September.
Inflation shows further signs of easing, though part of the
decline reflects technical factors. Consumer prices in February
were 5.3 percent above their level a year earlier, down from 6.1
percent in January, although quirks in measurement practices caused
part of this drop. Wholesale prices in January were 0.8 percent
above their level a year earlier.
Italy's trade deficit (s.a.) for 1991 was $12.9 billion, little
changed from 1990. The current account deficit (n.s.a.) widened to
$16 billion for the first three quarters of 1991, from $10.5 billion
during the same period in 1990, largely because of a $3 billion
increase in net outflow of investment income.

IV-25
On April 5, Italy will hold a general election. Voter
dissatisfaction appears widespread, and the political situation is
particularly uncertain.
The latest data for the United Kingdom indicate that economic
recovery continues to be elusive. Real GDP contracted 1.1 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter, after growing 0.7 percent in the
third quarter. Consumption grew only 0.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) and
investment fell 7.1 percent.
In January, manufacturing production (s.a.) fell 0.7 percent to
a level 1.0 percent below its fourth-quarter average and 3.8 percent
below its level in January 1991. Retail sales (s.a.) were up 0.3
percent in January and 0.4 percent in February. The unemployment
rate (s.a.) continued to mount, reaching a rate of 9.4 percent in
February.
Retail prices (n.s.a.) rose 0.5 percent in February, leaving
twelve-month inflation unchanged at 4.1 percent, compared with a
rate of 8.9 percent a year ago. The government's measure of
underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest rates, stood
at 5.6 percent in the year to February, down from a rate of 8.6
percent in February 1991. Wages continued to rise at an underlying
annual rate of 7.3 percent in January.
On March 10, Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont
presented the national government budget for the 1992-93 fiscal
year, which begins April 1. Lamont announced some minor tax cuts,
and, largely because of expectations of weak economic activity,
projected a budget deficit of 4-1/2 percent of GDP.
On March 11, Prime Minister John Major announced that a general
election will be held April 9. Recent polls suggest the election
will be very close. It is possible that neither the Tories nor the
Labour Party will win enough seats to control Parliament.

IV-26
The recovery in Canada lost ground in the fourth quarter of
1991, as real GDP (s.a.) dropped 0.8 percent (a.r.), taking the
level of output 1.9 percent below its peak in the first quarter of
1990. Total domestic demand (s.a.) edged up 0.9 percent (a.r.), but
the external sector made a negative contribution, as exports plunged
12 percent. A 20 percent (a.r.) leap in expenditures on plant and
equipment (s.a.) caused total fixed investment to rise 5.6 percent
despite a drop in the sum of residential and non-residential
construction, but consumption fell 1.6 percent.
First-quarter monthly data show continued weakness. The
unemployment rate rose from 10.3 percent (s.a.) in December to 10.4
percent in January and February, as total employment (s.a.) slipped
0.1 percent. A 12.5 percent increase in February was not sufficient
to lift housing starts (s.a.) above their December level, because of
January's 13.8 percent decline. Factory shipments (s.a.) and new
orders (s.a.) each fell 2.4 percent in January, the fifth
consecutive monthly decline for both measures, and retail sales
(s.a.) were virtually unchanged from their dismal December level.
1992 price data show continued success for the Bank of Canada's
efforts to reduce base inflation. The CPI excluding food and energy
(n.s.a.), rose 0.4 percent in February, lowering twelve-month
inflation from 2.9 percent to 2.8 percent. Wholesale prices
(n.s.a.) rose 0.1 percent in January, but stand 3.1 percent lower
than a year earlier. Wage settlements increased 3.6 percent in
1991, compared with 5.7 percent in 1990.
Canada's current account deficit (s.a.a.r.) increased $2
billion in the fourth quarter to a record $28 billion. The
merchandise trade surplus (s.a.) fell $0.1 billion to a twelve-year
low of $3.3 billion, but deterioration in the invisibles deficit
accounted for most of the current account change. Strong export

IV-27
growth in January caused the merchandise trade surplus (s.a.a.r.) to
rise from $6.6 billion to $11.2 billion, its highest level since
last May.
On February 25, Canadian Finance Minister Don Mazankowski
presented the federal government budget for fiscal year 1992, which
begins April 1. The overall fiscal stance will tighten slightly,
and the government expects the federal budget deficit to fall from
4.6 percent of GDP in fiscal year 1991 to 3.9 percent of GDP in
fiscal year 1992.
There is substantial uncertainty about Canada's political
future due to the lack of progress achieved thus far in discussions
of the National Unity Plan constitutional reform proposals announced
by the federal government last September. The Cabinet intends to
submit specific constitutional amendments to Parliament by late
April. Should it deem the revised proposals to be unacceptable, the
provincial government of Quebec has promised to hold a referendum by
the end of October, in which voters would be able to choose among
alternatives that would include secession.
Developments in the Former Soviet Union and East European Countries
The government of Russia has drafted a Memorandum of Economic
Policies, which summarizes its program for the first quarter of 1992
and outlines proposals for a broad range of policies to be
implemented later in the year. Except for rent, utilities, and
public transportation, most remaining administered prices at the
retail level will be eliminated by the end of March. Full
liberalization of energy prices has been postponed until late 1993.
Military expenditure cuts, subsidy reductions, and new taxes
have reduced the government budget deficit from more than 20 percent
of GDP in 1991 to an estimated 8 to 10 percent of GDP in the first

IV-28
quarter of 1992. The government plans to eliminate the deficit by
the end of the year.
The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) recently tightened monetary
policy. Growth of CBR credits to commercial banks was restricted,
the financing rate was increased to 20 percent (although the real
rate remains negative), and reserve requirements were raised.
However, recent reports suggest that the government is considering
monetizing wage and pension increases and subsidizing CBR credits to
failing industries.
Russia, along with several of the other republics of the former
Soviet Union, is expected to become a member of the IMF by the time
of the Interim Committee meeting in late April, or soon thereafter.
In Poland, on February 17 the new government of Prime Minister
Jan Olszewski unveiled its economic program. The program describes
a package of "anti-recessionary" policies that aim to stabilize
economic activity and hold down unemployment by aiding money-losing
state enterprises, while limiting inflation to current levels. In
mid-March, the government introduced to the parliament a budget for
the remainder of 1992 based on the new program. The budget aims to
hold the fiscal deficit to 5 percent of GDP through deep expenditure
cuts. Other budgetary provisions include a reduction in business
taxes and industrial policies targeted at expanding exports and
investment.
Because of objections to the course of policy and his loss of
authority on economic issues, Finance Minister Karol Lutkowski
submitted his resignation on February 15. In late February, the
Prime Minister nominated, and Parliament confirmed, Andrzej
Olechowski to be the new Finance Minister. In addition, on March 5,
Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz was approved to be the new Central Bank

IV-29
President. Gronkiewicz-Waltz was renominated by President Walesa
after being rejected by the Parliament in December.
In Czechoslovakia, over 8 million citizens (about half the
population) have purchased coupons that will give them the right to
purchase shares in medium- and large-size privatized firms. Many
investors are choosing to invest through one or more of the 437
private investment funds that have been created.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
Brazil has reached a debt rescheduling agreement with its Paris
Club creditors and may be able to agree with commercial bank
creditors on the terms of a debt and debt-service reduction package
within the next several weeks. Brazilian real GDP rose 1.2 percent
in 1991, after falling 4 percent in the previous year. In Mexico,
real GDP grew 3.6 percent last year. The interest rate on 28-day
Mexican T-bills has fallen by about 4 percentage points since early
February, reflecting continued capital inflows. In the wake of an
attempted coup on February 4, Venezuela is experiencing an ongoing
political crisis that could weaken the country's economic reform
program. Argentina has reached agreement with the IMF on the terms
of an SDR 2.1 billion Extended Fund Facility and is continuing
negotiations on a restructuring of its commercial bank debt. On
March 4, the Philippines received IMF Executive Board approval of a
revised stand-by arrangement, opening the way for the implementation
of an August 1991 financing agreement with commercial banks. The
current account deficit of Korea quadrupled to a record $8.8 billion
last year. In Taiwan, the current account surplus increased to
$12 billion in 1991 from $10.8 billion in 1990, and total reserves
less gold reached $84 billion in January 1992.
Individual country notes. In late February, Brazil reached a
debt rescheduling agreement with its Paris Club creditors. The

IV-30
agreement covers an estimated $9 billion in principal and interest
arrears and about $15 billion in principal and interest coming due
after the end,of 1991, and specifies that Brazil will make cash
payments of $4.1 billion towards arrears by September 1992.
Brazil and its commercial bank creditors may be able to reach
an agreement on a package of debt and debt-service reduction within
the next several weeks. Brazil has indicated that it could increase
interest payments above the present level of 30 percent of interest
due after an agreement is reached. In late February, Brazil's Bank
Advisory Committee presented a detailed proposal for a "phased-in"
approach to enhancements, under which banks would swap existing debt
for par and discount bonds with partial collateral on the condition
that Brazil would fund rolling interest support within a specified
period. The details of how a phase-in would be implemented are now
under discussion.
Real GDP rose 1.2 percent in 1991, after falling 4 percent in
1990. For the Sao Paulo region, which accounts for over one-third
of GDP, industrial sales in February were reportedly up slightly
from the seasonally low sales month of January. However, several
auto companies have suspended production or are operating well below
capacity in response to depressed sales. The consumer price index
compiled by the University of Sao Paulo rose 21.6 percent in
February compared with 25.8 percent in January.
Brazil's trade surplus for January-February 1992 was $1.9
billion, compared with $2.4 billion for the same period in 1991.
Capital inflows.continue, spurred by high domestic interest rates.
According to unofficial estimates, international reserves stood at
$12.5 billion in mid-March, up from $8.9 billion at the end of 1991.
Mexico's real GDP is estimated to have increased 3.6 percent in
1991. This growth rate is lower than the government's initial

IV-31
estimate of 4.5 percent, in part because of an upward revision of
1990 growth from 3.9 to 4.4 percent. Total investment grew by 8.5
percent in real terms, led by a 16 percent rise in investment in
machinery and equipment. Consumer prices rose by 1.2 percent in
February, down from 1.8 percent in January.
The 1991 merchandise trade deficit widened to $7.1 billion from
$0.5 billion in 1990. The value of imports rose 23 percent, while
export earnings climbed 13 percent for non-oil products but fell 19
percent for crude oil and petroleum derivatives.
Large capital inflows have helped to keep the peso/dollar
exchange rate near the lower limit of its band despite the trade
deficit. The exchange rate band has been widening since the system
was adopted last November, as the upper limit (in pesos per dollar)
rose daily by 20 centavos while the lower limit remained frozen.
The lower limit was to begin rising by 20 centavos per day on March
15, when the spread between the two limits reached 60 pesos, or
about 2 percent. On March 14, however, the Bank of Mexico decided
to keep the lower limit frozen at 3,051 pesos and allow the band to
continue to widen. On March 24, when the upper limit was 3,113
pesos, the peso/dollar rate was 3,072 pesos.
Capital inflows have also placed downward pressure on interest
rates. At the March 17 auction, 28-day Mexican Treasury bills
yielded 11.6 percent, 3.9 percentage points less than on February 4.
In February, PEMEX, the government oil company, established two
voluntary credit facilities with groups of foreign banks, the first
such arrangements in ten years. They were a letter of credit from
five European banks, backing a $230 million commercial paper
program, and a $100 million trade finance facility with 13 banks led
by Chase Manhattan Bank.

IV-32
On March 16, the financial group that acquired Mexico's second
largest bank when it was privatized last November issued
$555 million of stock in international equity markets, of which
$352 million was placed in New York. This is the first
international equity placement by a Mexican financial institution.
In the wake of an attempted coup on February 4, Venezuela is
experiencing an ongoing political crisis that could result in a
substantial weakening of the country's economic reform program.
President Carlos Andres Perez has to date rejected widespread calls
that he resign and allow presidential and legislative elections,
scheduled for December 1993, to be held this year. However, in
consultation with opposition politicians, Perez is considering
constitutional changes to respond to popular dissatisfaction with
his government and head off the possibility of a second coup
attempt. Although he has reiterated his commitment to economic
liberalization, Perez has frozen domestic gasoline and electricity
prices, which were being increased on a monthly basis.
Political uncertainty has led to incipient capital outflows and
pressure on the bolivar. The Central Bank of Venezuela succeeded in
stabilizing the currency (at about 65 Bs/$, compared with an end-
January rate of 62 Bs/$) by increasing domestic interest rates.
Between end-January and mid-March, the yield on 91-day central bank
bills rose from 33 percent to 38 percent and the Caracas stock
market index declined by over 14 percent. The consumer price index
increased 2.7 percent in February and has risen 31 percent over the
last 12 months.
In early March, Argentina and the IMF agreed on a letter of
intent for a three-year, SDR 2.1 billion Extended Fund Facility
(EFF) to replace the one-year stand-by arrangement approved in July
1991. The EFF, which is expected to be approved at the end of

IV-33
March, calls for an increase in Argentina's non-interest fiscal
surplus, excluding revenues from privatization, from 0.7 percent of
GDP in 1991 to 2 percent of GDP during the 1992-94 period. The EFF
includes a 25 percent set-aside to support a possible debt-reduction
arrangement now under negotiation by Argentina and its commercial
bank external creditors.
Consumer price inflation rose from 0.6 percent in December 1991
to 3 percent in January and 2.2 percent in February. The increase
largely reflects price hikes in food and housing services. By
contrast, wholesale prices rose only 0.7 percent over the first two
months of 1992, reflecting the role of the fixed exchange rate in
stabilizing the prices of tradable goods.
On March 4, the Philippines received IMF Executive Board
approval of a revised program that involves a four-month extension
of its stand-by arrangement and authorizes an additional drawing.
The revised program was approved after the government took new steps
to meet the arrangement's performance criteria. Drawings had been
suspended since last summer after the performance criteria were
missed. Reinstatement of the IMF program opened the way for the
implementation of an August 1991 agreement with commercial banks.
The agreement was amended in February and now provides for a cash
buyback and swap options involving (a) conversion bonds to be issued
at a 75 percent discount to banks agreeing to subscribe to new-money
bonds, (b) 15-year unguaranteed bonds carrying a temporary interest
rate reduction, or (c) 25-year collateralized bonds with a permanent
interest rate reduction.
Korea's current account deficit quadrupled to a record $8.8
billion in 1991. Only a prohibition on public construction in the
fourth quarter, reduced access to foreign currency loans, and delays
of import clearance by the Korean government reportedly kept the

IV-34
deficit from exceeding $10 billion. External debt rose to over
$39 billion in 1991 from $31.7 billion in 1990. In January 1992,
the current account deficit was unchanged from a year earlier at
$1.4 billion.
In Taiwan, an increase in export growth contributed to a
7.3 percent rise in real GNP last year. Taiwan's current account
surplus rose from $10.8 billion in 1990 to $12 billion in 1991,
despite a 5 percent appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar. Taiwan's
cumulative trade surplus expanded somewhat in the first two months
of 1992 to $1.3 billion from $1 billion in the same period a year
earlier. Taiwan's central bank has been attempting to slow the rate
of NT dollar appreciation through foreign exchange intervention and
by reducing the inflow of funds into the securities market. Total
reserves less gold increased by $10 billion in 1991 to $82.4 billion
and further to $84 billion in January 1992. Over the last few
months, the central bank has slowed the rate of foreign investment
approvals. After a further appreciation of the NT dollar in
January, the central bank temporarily halted foreign investment
inflows in February. Subsequently, the NT dollar has depreciated by
nearly 2 percent.
