The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity is uneven, but on the whole appears to be
expanding moderately in the second quarter. Employment increased in
April, especially in the service-producing sector, and the
unemployment rate edged down to 7.2 percent. Retail sales and
homebuying appear to have softened after very sharp gains earlier in
the year, but contracts and orders data suggest some firming in
business capital spending. On the inflation front, consumer prices
showed no further deceleration, on average, in March and April, and
the same was true of the employment cost index in the first quarter;
measured over longer time spans, however, the general trend of
inflation still appears to be gradually downward, owing to the
considerable slack in the economy.
Employment and Unemployment
Private payroll employment, which had dipped 18,000 in March,
rose 112,000 in April. Service establishments picked up 72,000 jobs
in April, as health services and business services both posted
notable gains. Retail trade, which has moved erratically of late,
also showed a relatively strong increase in jobs last month and
appears to have trended upward over the past few months. Employment
at state and local governments was revised up in March and rose
further in April. Manufacturing employment edged up for the third
straight month, after posting large losses over the preceding
several months. Construction employment, which was down last month,
has been about unchanged on net since the beginning of the year,
despite the rebound in housing activity.
The workweek fell 0.1 hour last month; this overshadowed the
rise in private employment and led to a 0.3 percent decline in
aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers. The April
level of hours was about equal to the first-quarter average.

The monthly survey of households has given a more upbeat view of
the labor market than has the payroll survey in recent months;
household employment rose 327,000 in April, bringing the increase
since the beginning of the year to more than 900,000. While we would
not be inclined to lean heavily on the household employment
statistics, we should note the possibility that job opportunities are
opening up at newer firms that are not captured adequately in the
payroll data. In addition, the number of persons reporting that they
are working part-time for economic reasons fell for the third
consecutive month in April.
Oher independent indicators of labor demand are positive, but
much less strongly. The Conference Board index of help-wanted
advertising turned up slightly in February and March, but remained at
a low level; as reported in the Consumer Confidence index, the
percentage of households viewing jobs as "hard to get" has come down a
bit, but the proportion who see jobs as "plentiful" has changed
little. Initial claims for unemployment insurance moved down to an
average of 415,000 during April, after averaging around 450,000 since
late last year.
The labor force participation rate has risen in the past few
months, retracing much of the decline that occurred between the end of
1989 and the end of 1991. While economic necessity could be pushing
some individuals back into the job market, enhanced employment
opportunities may also be exerting some pull. The rise in
participation has coincided with a sharp drop in the number of persons
who describe themselves as "keeping house and not wanting a job." The
number of so-called discouraged workers has dropped only slightly.
Industrial Production
Industrial production apparently posted its third consecutive
monthly increase in April, and the recent increases in durable goods

orders and motor vehicle production schedules bode well for further
gains in the near term.
Motor vehicle assemblies rose from a 9.1 million unit annual rate
in March to a 9.8 million unit pace in April, contributing
0.2 percentage point to the growth rate for total IP. Schedules call
for increases in output of both autos and trucks in May. While
another rise in auto assemblies seems plausible, the planned increase
in total truck production is less certain: Inventories of light
trucks stood at a relatively high 84-days' supply at the end of April.

Outside of motor vehicles, increases in April appear likely in
industries such as fabricated metals and rubber and plastic
products, in which higher output may be related to the rise in motor
vehicle production. Elsewhere, the limited available physical
product data were mixed: Output of paper and paperboard, as well as
petroleum refining, strengthened somewhat, but electricity
generation was little changed, and production of home appliances and
steel dipped. The return of striking workers at Caterpillar in the
latter half of April had virtually no effect on last month's data.
Taking a somewhat longer perspective, the gains in total
industrial production since its recent low in January have been
moderate, on balance, and have retraced only part of the drop over
the preceding three months. Much of the rebound has been
attributable to increased production of motor vehicles and parts and
to the return of utilities output to more normal levels after a

relatively warm winter. Apart from these categories, output of
consumer durables has shown moderate growth, and production of
business equipment has risen somewhat, reflecting further gains in
output of office and computing machinery and the recent upturn in
production of industrial equipment. However, output of materials
has risen only slightly.
Personal Income and Consumption
Personal consumption expenditures accelerated sharply in the
first quarter, and consumer confidence has moved above its lows of a
few months ago. The gain in spending, perhaps spurred in part by
the lagged effects of the rise in household wealth over the past
year, outpaced the increase in real disposable income. As a result,
the saving rate dropped to 4.7 percent, after several quarters in
the area of 5 to 5-1/2 percent.
The strength in spending in the first quarter was concentrated
in January and February, and outlays dropped noticeably in
March. In April, sales of motor vehicles were essentially
unchanged at a 12.4 million unit annual pace, and retail sales at
the control group of stores, which exclude sales at auto dealers and
building material and supply stores, rose only 1/4 percent in
nominal terms--insufficient to retrace the March decline. With the
CPI for these items about unchanged in April, real PCE for goods
other than motor vehicles also probably grew 1/4 percent last month,
but remained a tad below the first-quarter average.
Real disposable personal income picked up in the first quarter,
increasing 3 percent at an annual rate, after only fractional gains
in the second half of last year. However, most of the first-quarter
rise was attributable to one-time adjustments in transfer payments
and taxes. Notably, transfer payments were boosted significantly by
1. This pattern was exaggerated by the revised data on retail
sales.

cost-of-living adjustments for social security beneficiaries and
federal retirees, as well as by the extension of special
unemployment insurance benefits. In addition, the revisions to
withholding tax schedules in March contributed almost a percentage
point (annual rate) to the growth in real DPI for the quarter.
Because the lower withholding will increase take-home pay, it may
provide a boost to the spending by liquidity-constrained households;
however, on the whole, the effect is likely to be relatively small.
Apart from transfers and tax adjustments, incomes were
relatively weak in the first quarter. Given the softness in payroll
employment, wages and salaries increased at only about a
3-1/2 percent annual rate in nominal terms, or roughly 3/4 percent
in real terms. Meanwhile, personal interest income fell further in
early 1992, bringing the cumulative decline since late 1990 to
almost 7 percent.
Housing Markets
Indicators of single-family housing activity softened in March,
after posting sharp gains earlier in the year. The slowing likely
reflects, in part, the upturn in mortgage rates since January. In
addition, the unusually warm weather--and perhaps the prospect of a
tax credit for first-time homebuyers--may have imparted a greater
boost to activity in January and February than we had initially
thought.
Single-family housing starts declined a bit in March, but
remained around 1.1 million units, the highest level in two years.
However, permit issuance for single-family homes fell somewhat more;
given that measure's greater statistical reliability, it may
indicate that the drop-off in single-family building was greater
than suggested by the starts figure.

New home sales plunged 15 percent in March, more than reversing
the gains posted in the preceding two months. However, this drop
likely overstates the weakening in the market. The preliminary
estimates for new home sales have been subject to large,
predominantly upward revisions owing to late reports and to the
unanticipated importance of pre-sold homes.2 In addition, the
sharp drop in new home sales is at odds with builders' reports in
the monthly survey of the National Association of Home Builders,
which showed little change in activity in either March or April
(chart). Sales of existing homes remained at their two-year high in
March; however, most existing home sales are recorded at the time
the transaction "closes" and thus lag the readings on new home
sales, which are recorded at the time a contract is signed or when a
nonrefundable deposit is made prior to signing a contract.
In the multifamily sector, housing starts jumped to 265,000
units in March, a rate far above those seen in recent months and one
that is unlikely to be sustained. Permits for multifamily housing
construction fell about 8 percent in March, and vacancy rates for
rental units, which account for 90 percent of the multifamily
housing stock, have been stuck at more than 9 percent for some time
(chart). Vacancy rates for owner-occupied condominiums have come
down in recent quarters, but remain above the historical average.
Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment appears to have firmed in the first
quarter, after declining moderately over the preceding several
2. The Census Bureau routinely imputes values for late reports
and for units sold prior to permit issuance, but these imputations
have been insufficient of late. The revisions have raised the
preliminary monthly estimates nearly 7 percent, on average, during
the past six months.

II-15
quarters.3 Moreover, advance indicators point to a more
noticeable pickup in spending over the near term.
Outlays for producers' durable equipment posted a small
increase in the first quarter, largely on the strength of another
sharp advance in real purchases of computers, which rose about 25
percent at an annual rate. As in the fourth quarter, stepped-up
deliveries of IBM's new line of mainframe computers probably
accounted for some of the growth in computer shipments. However,
according to industry sources, demand for other types of office and
computing machinery has strengthened significantly since the middle
of last year, spurred in part by the rapid pace of technological
innovation, especially for workstations and network equipment.
Elsewhere, outlays for transportation equipment fell further in the
first quarter, as the share of light vehicles purchased by
businesses dropped sharply and deliveries of aircraft to domestic
firms failed to rebound from the extraordinarily low fourth-quarter
level. Outside of computers and transportation, equipment spending
was essentially flat in the first quarter after declining
appreciably during 1991.
On the whole, advance indicators point to a pickup in equipment
spending over the coming months. Gains in real computer outlays are
likely to slow from the very rapid pace of recent quarters.
However, with orders for a broad range of industrial equipment up
noticeably in recent months, higher shipments of noncomputer capital
goods appear to be in train for the next few quarters. Outlays for
aircraft also should revive somewhat in coming months, though the
3. According to BEA's advance estimate, real BFI declined at a
1-1/2 percent annual rate in the first quarter as a further
contraction in nonresidential structures more than offset a small
rise in outlays for equipment. However, more recent data suggest
that outlays for structures fell somewhat less, and those for
equipment rose somewhat more, than BEA had anticipated.
Accordingly, total BFI probably will be revised up to show a modest
increase in the first quarter--the first rise since mid-1990.

improvement may not be very durable, given the substantial excess
capacity among domestic airlines and the sharp drop in their orders
in recent quarters.
Nonresidential construction spending fell again in the first
quarter. Outlays for office buildings continued to plummet; this
sector continues to be burdened by a huge overhang of unoccupied
space, and further reductions in spending are likely through the
remainder of the year. In contrast, the declines in the non-office
commercial sector, which consists primarily of warehouses and other
retail properties, may be starting to ease. The first-quarter drop
in spending on these structures was the smallest in some time, and
the decline in contracts in this sector appears to have ended.
Meanwhile, construction put-in-place data point to another sizable
gain in industrial structures in the first quarter.
Manufacturing and Trade Inventories
There was a sizable liquidation of nonfarm inventories in the
first quarter, although the drawdown likely was much smaller than
the $26 billion annual rate estimated by BEA in its advance GDP
report. Declines in inventory-sales ratios were widespread at
factories and retail establishments, suggesting that the imbalances
that developed late last year have been lessened significantly. In
contrast, stocks held by merchant wholesalers are still high.
Manufacturers' inventories were reduced in January and February
and were little changed in March. Stock-sales ratios for many
industries, notably primary metals, nonelectrical machinery,
transportation equipment, textiles, and rubber and plastics, have
fallen to their lowest levels in some time.
In the trade sector, the inventory situation is uneven. With
the surge in sales in early 1992, excess stocks at many retail
establishments were reduced: Non-auto retail inventories fell at an

average annual rate of $11 billion on a current-cost basis in
January and February. The improvement was especially notable for
the general merchandise, apparel, and furniture (GAF) grouping of
stores, where stocks had climbed significantly in late 1991; the
inventory-sales ratio for GAF stores fell in February to its lowest
level in many years.
In contrast, inventories held by wholesalers remained quite
high relative to sales at the end of the first quarter. For the
quarter as a whole, stocks rose another $9 billion, after an even
larger gain during the fourth quarter. However, sales increased
considerably in the first quarter, and the inventory-sales ratio for
merchant wholesalers was about unchanged.
Federal Government
The federal government recorded a $197 billion unified budget
deficit for the first half of the fiscal year, up $45 billion from a
year earlier. The falloff in foreign contributions to the Defense
Cooperation Account (DCA) accounted for $23 billion of this increase
and was only partly offset by the marked slowdown in deposit
insurance (DI) outlays. Outlays excluding DCA and DI increased
about 7 percent, paced by sizable increases in spending on Medicaid
and Medicare and on unemployment insurance and other cyclically
sensitive income-support programs. In contrast, defense spending
(excluding DCA) was about 4 percent below year-earlier levels.
Meanwhile, receipts were only about 2 percent higher than in the
first six months of FY1991, held down by slow over-the-year income
growth and faster-than-usual disbursements of individual tax refunds
through March. Corporate tax receipts were also weak.
Daily Treasury Statements indicate that net final settlements
on CY1991 individual income tax liabilities were below the previous
year's level. These data, in conjunction with the information on

II-24
declarations and withheld taxes, suggest that personal income tax
liabilities for CY1991 are about the same as they were for 1990,
despite a rise of about 2 percent in taxable income, on a National
Income and Product Accounts basis, and the $7 billion in individual
income tax increases that were enacted in the 1990 budget
agreement.
With six months of data in hand, the estimated FY1992 deficit
clearly looks like it will be much smaller than the $400 billion
figure estimated by the Administration last winter. The main reason
is that outlays for deposit insurance will fall far short of the
$80 billion estimated by OMB for this fiscal year; so far, spending
has been only $6 billion, on net, and the RTC currently is hampered
by a lack of spending authority. Spending for several other areas
also appears to be running appreciably lower than would be
consistent with OMB's full-year estimates. In particular, defense
spending (excluding DCA) has averaged only about $25 billion per
month over the past six months. It would have to pick up to a
$27 billion average pace over the remainder of the year to reach
OMB's FY1992 total; although the possibility of somewhat higher
spending in coming months cannot be ruled out, a jump of this
magnitude would be unusual.5
House and Senate conferees are meeting to hammer out a budget
resolution for FY1993. The only major area of contention is defense
spending; relative to the caps legislated in the 1990 Budget Act,
4. One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that capital
gains realizations may have been quite low in 1991, perhaps
reflecting the weakness in real estate markets. Because the
National Income and Product Accounts do not include capital gains
and losses, NIPA-based income measures could have looked
substantially stronger than true taxable income.
5. On an NIPA basis, real defense purchases edged down in the
first quarter, after a sharp drop in the fourth quarter of 1991.
The level of purchases in the first quarter was 6 percent below the
average for FY1991 as a whole. By contrast, the President's budget
implied a drop in real defense purchases of only about 3 percent for
FY1992.

II-25
the House budget resolution cuts $15 billion in budget authority for
defense and $10 billion in outlays, while the Senate budget
resolution, like the Administration's FY1993 budget, would make
reductions of roughly half that magnitude. Debates about national
security needs in the post-cold war period have, predictably, become
muddled with concerns about local job preservation. Both budget
resolutions devote cuts in defense spending to deficit reduction and
set discretionary domestic spending at the cap legislated in the
1990 Budget Act.
Momentum is building in Congress to submit to the states for
ratification an amendment to the Constitution that would restrict
Congress's ability to incur deficits. The proposals currently being
discussed would require that deficit spending be approved by
60 percent of each house beginning as early as FY1995. In addition,
some members of Congress are pushing for a requirement that tax
increases also be approved by 60 percent of each house. Current
indications are that congressional approval of some form of a
balanced-budget amendment is likely. However, obtaining
approval will be more difficult if Representative Panetta, chairman
of the House Budget Committee, makes good on his promise to link any
vote for a balanced-budget amendment in the House to a specific plan
for achieving budget balance between now and the time that the
amendment becomes effective.
State and Local Government
According to BEA's advance estimate, real purchases of goods
and services by state and local governments rose at a 3.2 percent
annual rate in the first quarter, after a much smaller increase in
6. A constitutional amendment requires approval of two-thirds of
each house and ratification by three-quarters of state legislatures.

the fourth quarter. These gains have now retraced the decline
that occurred over the first three quarters of 1991. Most of the
rise in the first quarter, as well as the drop in 1991, was in
construction, which tends to be volatile; the sharpest increases in
the first quarter were in spending for educational facilities and
highways. On balance, real purchases outside of construction were
essentially flat in the first quarter and have been little changed,
on net, since early 1991; typically these outlays--largely employee
compensation--make up the bulk of states' general fund budgets and
thus come within the purview of their balanced budget requirements.
Despite the increase in purchases, the deficit in operating and
capital accounts, excluding social insurance funds, fell a bit
further to an estimated $22 billion (annual rate) in the first
quarter (chart). Even so, it remains quite large in historical
terms and has been exacerbated in many states this year by spending
overruns--particularly for Medicaid and other welfare programs--and
by revenue shortfalls. Receipts have been coming in below
expectations in thirty-five states. So far, only a few legislatures
have passed, or are proposing, major tax increases for enactment in
fiscal year 1992, and collections from new tax hikes are expected to
total only around $5 billion, or about one-third the level seen last
year (chart).
Labor Costs
In April, average hourly earnings of production or
nonsupervisory workers fell 0.1 percent, reducing the past twelve-
month change to 2-1/2 percent--down from nearly 3-1/2 percent as
of a year ago. This was a more favorable reading on the progress on
labor-cost disinflation than was provided by the more comprehensive
7. The figure probably will be revised upward somewhat when BEA
incorporates data on construction in March into the next GDP
estimate.

employment cost index data through the first quarter. The ECI for
hourly compensation in private industry rose 4 percent (annual rate)
over the December-to-March period, about the same pace as during the
second half of 1991. Over the twelve months ended in March,
compensation costs increased 4-1/4 percent, about 1/4 percentage
point less than in the preceding twelve-month period.
Taking a somewhat longer perspective, ECI compensation has
slowed about a percentage point since mid-1990. The slowing to date
in compensation has been on the low side of what we might have
expected, given the amount of slack in labor markets since late 1990
and the decline in inflation expectations that has occurred over
this period. Nevertheless, barring a sharp reversal of
inflation expectations or tightening of labor markets, we expect a
further diminution of labor cost pressures in coming quarters.
As a matter of arithmetic, continued upward momentum in benefit
costs has been a major factor in the comparatively slow deceleration
in labor costs. Benefit costs have been rising at a little over a
6 percent annual rate over the past two years, largely because
soaring expenses for medical care have continued to drive up both
premiums for health insurance and payments for legally required
workers' compensation programs. As employers attempt to control
total labor costs, one might have expected to see some offset in the
form of lower wage increases. But, if anything, the deceleration in
wages and salaries--from about 4-1/2 percent in mid-1990 to around
3-1/2 percent by early 1992--also has been on the small side.
By occupational groups, the deceleration in compensation over
the past two years has been concentrated in white-collar jobs.
Within that category, the index for sales workers has seen the
8. In addition, the increase in social security taxes at the
beginning of 1990 had added 0.2 percentage point to the increase in
compensation over the four quarters ended in 1990:2.

sharpest slowing--more than 2 percentage points since mid-1990 and
roughly 5 percentage points from its 1989 peak. But, compensation
of workers in other white-collar jobs, notably professionals and
executives, also has decelerated more than 1 percentage point over
the past two years. Among blue-collar occupations, workers in
nonunion jobs have experienced a deceleration similar to that for
white-collar occupations. However compensation gains for unionized
jobs have picked up, with the acceleration owing entirely to sharp
9increases in benefit costs. Apparently, unionized firms have
been unable to hold down benefit costs--either because they are
locked into labor contracts or because unions have been successful
in protecting health insurance benefits--or to offset them with
smaller wage hikes. Union wage increases in the ECI, while at a
moderate 3-1/2 percent pace, have not slowed noticeably over the
past two years.
Prices
The CPI rose 0.2 percent in April after a jump of 0.5 percent
in March. Energy prices climbed further in April, but food prices
edged down and the rate of increase in the prices of other goods and
services moderated. Over the past 12 months, the CPI excluding food
and energy has risen about 4 percent. The PPI excluding food and
energy rose 0.2 percent in April, about the same as the average
monthly increase over the preceding six months.
The CPI for energy rose 0.4 percent in April--after advancing
0.6 percent in March--as a result of increases for natural gas and
gasoline. The higher gasoline prices retraced part of the declines
posted in preceding months and reflected some firming in domestic
demand and the rising cost of crude oil. Wholesale price data for

workers are union members and if wages are determined by collective
bargaining.

early May point to further increases in retail prices of petroleum
products this month.
Consumer food prices declined 0.1 percent in April, after
rising 0.5 percent in March. The prices of fruits and vegetables,
which had risen sharply in February and March, fell 1 percent in
April; a further decline may be in store in May. Average price
increases for other foods have continued to be small so far this
year, and the twelve-month rate of change in the CPI for food has
been running in the range of 1 to 2 percent for the past several
months. Nor are price pressures much in evidence at earlier points
in the food sector. The PPI for finished foods declined in April
for a second month, and it was little changed, on net, over
the first four months of 1992. The PPI for crude foods also
declined in both March and April; the April reading was
3-1/4 percent below the level of a year earlier.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI for goods advanced
0.2 percent in April, down from 0.5 percent in March. Apparel
prices fell 0.8 percent, after increases in February and March that
reflected the introduction of new seasonal clothing into the CPI
sample.10 New car prices also registered a sizable increase for
the second month, perhaps reflecting the higher prices previously
announced by Japanese manufacturers.
The CPI for nonenergy services was up 0.3 percent in April,
after rising 0.5 percent in March. Airfares rose another
1.2 percent after a large increase in March.11 In addition,
rents, which increased sharply in March, were little changed
10. Changes in BLS methods and related difficulties with seasonal
adjustment have contributed to this monthly pattern in recent years.
11. The mid-April restructuring of airfares should have a limited
effect on the CPI measure, which is designed to represent consumer
travel and is, therefore, based mainly on discount fares. The
steepest of the announced reductions were for first-class and
regular coach fares.

in April. By contrast, other renters' costs rose 1 percent last
month.
The underlying trend of inflation, as proxied by the twelve-
month change in the CPI excluding food and energy, currently is
running at about 4 percent, roughly a percentage point less than at
this time last year. However, the slowing in this measure occurred
during 1991, and the most recent monthly readings have flattened out
or edged up. As shown in the table on the opposite page, the rise
in prices during the six months ending in April was about
1/2 percentage point greater than during the preceding six months,
with some acceleration evident for most broad categories of goods
and services. The pickup in goods prices may reflect, in part,
higher import prices as well as actions by retailers to rebuild
profit margins at a time of unexpectedly strong sales.
Nonetheless, the higher CPI inflation rates recently are
difficult to square with the gradual slowing in labor costs, ample
capacity, and a further unwinding of inflation expectations. One
possibility is that the movement in the CPI excluding food and
energy both overstated the underlying rate of inflation around the
beginning of 1991--reflecting hikes in excise taxes, the passthrough
of higher energy prices to airfares, and seasonal adjustment
difficulties for apparel and some other commodities--and understated
it subsequently, as the drop in energy prices after the Gulf War
pushed down airfares and seasonal adjustment problems were reversed.
More fundamentally, it is not unusual to experience a temporary
pickup in prices during a longer period of disinflation (see the
chart on the next page). Given the favorable trends in the
determinants of prices, the recent pickup in the CPI excluding food
and energy seems more likely to be such a transitory setback to the

disinflation process rather than a sign that inflation again is
heating up.
At earlier stages of processing, prices of intermediate
materials less food and energy also have firmed somewhat in recent
months, in line with industrial demand. Nevertheless, with capacity
utilization still at relatively low levels, this PPI measure remains
little changed from its level of a year earlier. The PPI for crude
nonfood materials less energy also has picked up in the past few
months, mainly owing to higher prices for metal scrap, but is still
below its level in April 1991.
In the commodity markets, spot prices of industrial materials
have risen somewhat further since the last Greenbook, with increases
of about 1 percent in both the Journal of Commerce index of
12industrial prices and its sub-index for metals. However, most
of the increases occurred early in the period. Among the metals,
prices have moved up notably for zinc and also have risen for some
other metals, but copper and aluminum have posted relatively small
net changes. To some extent, the limited recovery in these prices,
particularly the nonferrous metals traded on world markets, may be
reflecting soft demand abroad as well as, for aluminum, a continued
flow of imports from the former Soviet republics.
12. Over the same period, the CRB spot industrials index
registered a much larger increase, boosted in part by a jump in the
quotation for lead scrap used in this measure. Moreover, aluminum
prices are not included in the index.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Demands for money and credit have been exceptionally weak over
the past couple of months, and interest rates have declined on
balance since the March 31 FOMC meeting. The easing at the short
end of the market was encouraged by a largely unexpected quarter-
point reduction in the federal funds rate in early April, but it has
amounted to 40 to 50 basis points at three- and six-month
maturities. Meanwhile, longer-term bond yields have fallen 10 to 20
basis points. Although Chemical Bank lowered its prime rate a
quarter point following the System's easing, other banks stayed at
6-1/2 percent, maintaining a fairly wide spread over money market
rates. Stock prices generally have remained at high levels, buoyed
by evidence of improving profits as well as lower interest rates.
Bank shares in particular have performed well as first-quarter
earnings reports were seen as further confirming that asset quality
problems have begun to recede.
M2 and M3 contracted in March and April, as special factors
that earlier had boosted deposit growth dissipated. The weakness in
the broad monetary aggregates is related in part to the continuing
contraction of depository credit. Credit demands from businesses
and households remained quiescent. Businesses have satisfied their
limited financing needs in the stock and bond markets, while
households evidently have remained cautious borrowers. Net
borrowing by state and local governments has remained sluggish, as
fairly large gross offerings of bonds primarily have been to
refinance outstanding debt. The federal sector's borrowing
requirement has diminished seasonally. Overall, growth of debt of
domestic nonfederal sectors, which had been slower than that of
nominal income in the first quarter, remained anemic in April.

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
After posting substantial gains earlier in the year, M2 fell at
a 1/2 percent annual rate in March and at a 2 percent pace in April.
From the fourth quarter of 1991 to April, M2 grew at about a 2-3/4
percent annual rate, placing it just above the lower bound of its
1992 range. Even the faster pace of growth in the first quarter as
a whole fell short of that of nominal GDP, and velocity rose further
despite declines in opportunity costs (chart). Recent weakness in
M2 has occurred in the face of still small opportunity costs. The
contraction in M2 and further runoffs of large-time deposits pushed
M3 down at about a 3 percent annual rate in March and April, leaving
it a shade below the lower bound of its annual target range.

Demand deposits, the engine of growth for the aggregates in the
first part of the year, sputtered in March and April. Respondents
to the Senior Financial Officer Survey, taken in mid-March,
attributed the earlier strength in demand deposits mainly to
increased compensating balance requirements and higher balances held
by mortgage servicers because of mortgage prepayments. With
compensating balances catching up to the sizable reductions in
short-term interest rates at the beginning of the year and short-
term rates backing up slightly in February and March, some of that
impetus disappeared. Mortgage refinancing applications have
declined substantially from their peak early this year, presumably
feeding through to a decline in mortgage prepayments and lessened
deposit holdings by mortgage servicers.
The growth of M2 also was weakened in March and April by a
pickup in RTC activity, which disrupts depositor relationships. In
addition, the pattern of this year's tax refunds and payments may
explain some of the movement in liquid household accounts. Refunds
were stronger in January and February and weaker in March and April
than would be expected from historical patterns, so that, after
seasonal adjustment, such accounts likely were boosted in the first
two months of the year and depressed in the next two months.
Individual nonwithheld tax payments came in below last year's
already depressed level producing a smaller buildup in checkable
deposits in March and early April and presumably a smaller runoff at
the end of the month and in early May.
Abstracting from these special factors, underlying growth in M2
appears to have remained basically weak, as the nontransaction
component of M2 has dropped this year, resuming its slide in March
and April after a spurt in February. While depositories continue to
price savings deposits and short-term CDs competitively with market

III-5
rates, medium- and long-term CD rates remain well below comparable
Treasury yields. The lack of aggressive pricing for these deposits
evidently has encouraged investors to move from retail CDs into
stock and bond mutual funds in order to take advantage of higher
anticipated returns.
M3 was depressed not only by the drop in M2 over March and
April but also by heightened runoffs in its non-M2 components.
While institution-only money funds rebounded in April, large time
deposits continued to decrease. Some of the drop in large time
deposits occurred at foreign-related institutions; Japanese banks,
facing investor resistance and higher risk premia. cut their
outstanding Yankee CDs and replaced them largely with Eurodollar
borrowings.
The weakness in the broader monetary aggregates accords with
the asset side of depository balance sheets. Although bank credit
picked up in both March and April, loans were about flat. Thus, the
share of government securities in total bank credit rose further, to
20-1/2 percent or about four percentage points above the previous
peak in 1983 (chart). The steady accumulation of securities over
the last four years has significantly enhanced liquidity, suggesting
that banks are well-positioned to meet increasing loan demands when
they occur.
Among the loan categories, real estate loans, which expanded
slowly in March, were about flat in April. Consumer loans adjusted
for estimated securitizations were down slightly in March and were
about unchanged in April. Business loans continued to run off in
March and April, but those made at smaller banks, which had declined
steadily since late 1990, showed signs of turning around. The
recent survey of senior loan officers at large banks further

confirms that the tightening of underwriting standards for making
loans has come to an end. Indeed, likely reflecting improved
capital positions and more evident profit opportunities, some
respondents indicated greater willingness to make loans to consumers
and, to a lesser extent, to small businesses. Little change was
reported in willingness to make construction and commercial real
estate loans, implying that a highly restrictive posture toward such
lending remains.

annual rate. Corporate needs for borrowed funds apparently were
damped by strong profit flows and weaker capital spending,
especially for inventories, as well as by continued heavy equity
issuance. Credit demands were focused on the bond market, as many
corporations apparently took advantage of the relatively low long-
term rates to secure funds in anticipation of future needs. The
uptick in long-term rates in February and March, however, induced
some large, creditworthy businesses to shift temporarily to the
commercial paper market. In April, net borrowing appears to have
remained slow. Commercial paper issuance by nonfinancial firms
dropped back after a spurt in February and March. Gross public bond
and stock issuance at nonfinancial corporations slackened only a bit
from the heavy pace in March, but the proceeds in many cases
continued to be used to retire debt.
Investors continued to show interest in lower-rated corporate
bonds; public offerings in April slipped slightly from elevated
level in March, but remained well above the average of last year.
Balance sheet restructurings and declining default rates have
burnished the reputation of this sector. Indeed, the share of new
issues in the lower tiers of the below-investment-grade category has
continued to increase and the ranks of issuers have included more
cyclical firms, such as home builders. Rate spreads on high-yield
bonds relative to Treasuries were about unchanged in April, but have
drifted lower more recently.
The aversion of some life insurance companies to lower-rated
private placements reportedly has eased a bit, in part because their
abstinence over the past two years has left some with room to buy
limited amounts. Overall in the private placement market, reports
from market participants on gross issuance this year range from

III-10
about unchanged to down a bit from last year's pace. New
sources of funds to the private placement market from outside the
insurance industry have begun to emerge this year as investors in
publicly offered lower-rated debt have shown some interest in
private issues.
Gross equity issuance continued fairly strong in April, but
initial public offerings (IPOs) stumbled. Anecdotal reports suggest
that investors have become more cautious about IPOs, and at least
one large recapitalization plan was canceled in recent weeks. While
reverse LBO activity has slowed, many highly leveraged firms have
plans to raise equity in the near future. In addition, General
Motors announced plans to raise more than $2 billion in common
equity this quarter after having raised $2 billion in three separate
preferred stock offerings in the past year. GM was one of several
major industrial companies whose debt was downgraded in the first
quarter of 1992.
In total, Moody's downgraded 55 nonfinancial companies in the
quarter, compared to only 29 upgradings. However, the number of
upgradings was the highest in two years and the number of
downgradings has abated considerably from the trough of the
recession. Many of the improved ratings were the result of equity
infusions, especially among speculative-grade issuers. For several
investment-grade issuers, additional capital was only sufficient to
prevent a further drop in credit standing.
The condition of U.S. banks appears to be improving, partly
reflecting wider net interest margins. Downgradings of debt eased
in the first quarter, while the number of upgradings increased.
Moody's cited progress in dealing with real estate loan problems as

corporations is estimated to have been $75 billion in 1991, down 14
percent from the level in 1990.

a reason for the improvement in the sector ratings. The stock
market was pleasantly surprised by higher earnings at Citicorp,
Wells Fargo, and Chase Manhattan, and bank stocks generally rose
substantially on the news. Bank stock prices showed little initial
reaction to the May 12 announcement that the FDIC intends to raise
deposit insurance premiums, from an average of 23 cents per $100 of
deposits to 28 cents per $100 of deposits.
Other sectors also have fared well in the stock market since
the last FOMC, raising the Dow Jones average to a record and holding
the S&P 500 and NYSE averages near their peak levels. The NASDAQ
average has performed less well, and is down a little in recent
weeks as investor ardor for high-tech growth stocks has cooled.
Price indexes for cyclically sensitive companies have been strong,
supported by incoming signs of a strengthening economy, along with
higher than expected first-quarter earnings.
The rise in stock prices drove the ratio of current prices to
four-quarter trailing earnings for the S&P 500 to a record 26 in
mid-April. Most earnings forecasts suggest this measure will fall
appreciably as the year progresses, but to a level that would
scarcely be low by historical standards.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that a federal deficit of $42 billion in
the second quarter will be financed by $51 billion of marketable
borrowing as the Treasury builds up its cash balance in advance of
larger shortfalls expected over the summer and fall. The projected
$30 billion decrease in marketable borrowings from the first quarter
largely is accounted for by paydowns in cash management bills.
Gross auction sizes have been little changed from first-quarter
levels, with the exception of weekly bill auctions which have been
increased from $22.8 to $23.2 billion. The size and composition of

the May midquarter refunding package was unchanged from that of
February, when Treasury reduced the size of its long-term bond
offering by $2 billion relative to the prior refunding.
The Treasury left unclear the debt management consequences of
potential Brady plan debt-restructuring agreements with Argentina
and Brazil. A common feature of such debt-relief agreements is some
form of credit enhancement in which the debtor country sets up an
escrow account of zero-coupon Treasury securities to guarantee the
repayment of principal. The Treasury announced that it was willing
to issue zero-coupon securities directly to those countries, as it
had for Mexico, but encouraged them to purchase zeroes in the
market. Some market participants have asserted that the possibility
of such large purchases has depressed yields at the long end of the
maturity spectrum.
Municipal Securities
Gross offerings of long-term municipal bonds remained robust in
April, though down somewhat from the rapid March pace. Refunding
volume was strong last month, as it has been throughout the year.
Short-term volume picked up in April, relative to the slow pace of
issuance in the previous month, largely as a result of a $2.3
billion issue by New York State. The state was able to price the
short-term issue to yield about 5 basis points less than similarly
rated issues, evidencing increased investor confidence in its fiscal
condition. Market participants evidently believe that the state is
less likely to end the fiscal year with a shortfall. In the past,
New York has used notes to cover shortfalls, which was the principal

problem cited by the credit agencies in the state's recent
downgrading.2
Credit rating changes in the first quarter of 1992 present a
mixed picture of credit quality developments in the municipal
sector (table). On the one hand, Standard and Poor's upgraded about
as many issues as it downgraded, a distinct improvement compared
with the previous two years when the number of downgrades far
exceeded the number of upgrades. On the other hand, the dollar
volume of downgradings continued to outstrip upgradings by a sizable
margin. The downgradings were concentrated among general obligation
issues; Northeast municipalities, especially, remained under stress,
once again accounting for a disproportionate share of the
downgradings. Nonetheless, many analysts expect the financial
condition of state and local units in this region to stabilize soon.
California's fiscal position continues to deteriorate, and the
credit agencies recently warned that the state could face further
downgradings. Even before the damage associated with the riots in
early May, the agencies noted that the state faces a budget deficit
for fiscal 1993 of approximately $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion from
December's projections. Further, the new projection of state
revenue suggests that the state's deficit for fiscal 1992, beginning
July 1, may rise to $6 billion. California's budget difficulties
2. Trading of the short-term deficit note issued by New York
State in March nearly came to a halt recently as a result of a lower
state court ruling that the sale of these notes was
unconstitutional. The court ruled that the $531 million issue
violated the state's constitutional prohibition against incurring

stem primarily from disappointing tax receipts owing to its weak
economy.
The decline in Japanese share prices has caused some concern
about the credit quality of tax-exempt bonds backed with letters of
credit issued by Japanese banks. These banks had issued about 40
percent of the municipal letters of credit extended since 1982,
backing more than $70 billion of debt. With the value of their
credit enhancement diminished, trading in these bonds has slowed
somewhat and spreads have widened.
Mortgage Markets
Contract rates on conventional fixed-rate mortgages have
decreased nearly 1/4 percentage point since the end of March, but
still remain about 1/2 percentage point above their January lows.
Spreads over Treasuries have narrowed somewhat in recent weeks,
after widening late last year in response to higher levels of
interest rate volatility and growing prepayment risk (chart).
Starting rates on adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) fell about 15
basis points, leaving them about 275 basis points below the thirty-
year fixed-rate mortgage rate.
Despite the recent decline in mortgage interest rates, lending
activity remains subdued compared to earlier in the year. The
latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association's weekly survey
show that the volume of loan applications at mortgage bankers has
fallen further from the peak earlier in the year. Applications for
home purchase mortgages have declined to levels last seen in
January, while refinancing applications have unwound by more,
dropping to the level of last September.
Although the total volume of mortgage originations has slowed,
the relative volumes of different types of mortgage products varies

widely (table). In particular, ARMs have lost market share despite
very attractive starting rates because of the competition from still
relatively low rates on fixed-rate mortgages and because Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac now require lenders to qualify borrowers at a
minimum 7 percent interest rate. The more significant change in
market share, however, has come in intermediate-term mortgage
products, including five- and seven-year mortgages with balloon and
reset features. With the introduction of balloon mortgages,
intermediate-term mortgage originations grew to 26 percent of FanniePercent

Mae and Freddie Mac single-family pass-through originations in 1991
and surged to 41 percent in the first quarter of 1992. The steeper
yield curve has allowed lenders to offer lower rates on
intermediate-term mortgages, thereby permitting borrowers to shorten
the maturity of their mortgage without increasing their monthly
payments. The recent pickup in these products also owes to strong
investor demand from banks and insurance companies attracted to
shorter duration mortgage-backed securities to supplement their
purchases of CMOs.
Issuance of mortgage-backed securities set a record in the
first quarter, reaching a seasonally adjusted monthly average rate
of $35 billion (table). March saw an all-time monthly high of $39
billion, as the mortgages extended in the refinancing boom that
peaked around mid-January were packaged into marketable assets.
Issuance of derivative mortgage securities also rebounded in March
from a relatively weak level in February. Market reports suggest
that pass-through issuance remained strong in April, although the
March pace probably was not sustained, owing to slower mortgage
refinancing volumes in recent months.
Consumer Credit
Outstanding consumer installment credit declined at about a
2-3/4 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in March, following
nearly a 1 percent decline in February (table). Revolving credit
flattened out in March, after posting moderate gains earlier in the
year, while auto loans continued their runoff.
Although much of the weakness in consumer credit over the past
two years can be attributed to sluggish growth of consumption
expenditures, the first quarter pickup in spending did not show
through to consumer borrowing (chart). Relatively high costs of
consumer credit, desires to trim debt levels, and attractive terms

on automobile leases evidently continued to restrain such borrowing;
some households may have tapped home equity lines or cash from
mortgage refinancings to cover expenditures.
Gross public issuance of securities backed by consumer loans
averaged $2.3 billion per month in the first quarter of 1992--the
smallest volume since the third quarter of 1989 (table). In the
first quarter, automobile issues averaged $1.6 billion per month,
with the bulk coming from GMAC alone. The downgrading of the
commercial paper of both GMAC and GM significantly increased their
cost of funds and made securitization an attractive alternative.
Also in the first quarter, the RTC securitized a portion of the
mobile home loans in its portfolio.
Only two credit card-backed issues were brought to market; the
cutback owed to the generally lower cost of on-balance-sheet
funding, the improved state of bank balance sheets, and the sluggish
growth in new loans. Additionally, many banks may already have
securitized as much of their portfolio as is practicable. Of the
$54 billion in outstanding balances of securitized commercial bank
credit card loans, $52 billion (96 percent) originally was on the
books of 17 banks.
Recent weeks also have seen a number of large, nationwide
credit card issuers announce new pricing strategies. Credit card
rates for the most common credit card programs have been edging down
slowly in recent quarters, but the decline has been much less than
for other types of consumer loans. The new pricing strategies offer
different rates to various segments of the customer base and will
result in lower rates for large numbers of customers. In
particular, active cardholders who have good payment records will
have their rates reduced some 4 or 5 percentage points below those
charged to customers with greater perceived risk.

Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in February declined to $3.4
billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis), from the revised $5.9
billion deficit in January, as exports increased $2.4 billion and
imports remained roughly constant. In February, most of the
increase in exports was in capital goods, with aircraft particularly
strong, followed by smaller increases in automotive products and
other consumer goods. March trade data will be released on May
20th.

For January and February combined, exports were about unchanged
from the strong fourth-quarter rate, but more than 7 percent higher
than a year earlier. Most of the increase in exports over the past
year was in capital goods, split about evenly between aircraft and
other machinery. Automotive exports have also risen in the past
year, especially to Mexico, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Two thirds of
the increase in exports in the past year went to less developed
countries, with Mexico accounting for a third of the total increase.
Exports to the Asian NIEs dropped off in January-February.

Imports in January and February were 2 percent lower than in
the fourth quarter. Most of this decline came from a fall in oil
import prices (discussed below). Non-oil imports also fell below
the fourth-quarter rate as imports of consumer goods dropped off
somewhat from a very strong fourth-quarter pace. Retail
inventories, which had swelled in the fourth quarter, appear to have
been drawn down in the first quarter, reflecting both increased
consumer spending and somewhat lower imports of consumer products by
retailers. Despite this recent decline, however, non-oil imports in
January-February were still more than 7 percent above the first
quarter of 1991, reflecting a strong expansion of imports of
consumer goods over the past year.
Oil Imports
The value of imported oil in January and February combined was
14 percent less than in the fourth quarter, as a $2.75 per barrel
price decline swamped a small increase in quantity. Prices fell in
the first quarter (January-February) on continued mild winter
weather and sluggish economic activity.

activity, and uncertainty over exports from Libya and the former
Soviet Union. Spot prices currently (May 12) stand at almost $21.00
per barrel. Given shipping and contract lags, prices of imported
oil probably will record a $0.50 per barrel increase in March and
perhaps another $1.00 in April to about $16.80 per barrel.
The quantity of oil imported in January-February was little
changed from the fourth quarter as mild winter weather held down
demand. Weekly data for March indicate continued declines in
stocks, which, coupled with a gain in consumption, should leave
imports at about the February rate.
Prices of Exports and Non-oil Imports
BLS prices of non-oil imports declined slightly in March after
increasing for six consecutive months. For the entire first quarter
non-oil import prices rose 4.5 percent (AR), following a 3.9 percent
increase in the fourth quarter of 1991. On a NIPA basis, non-oil
import prices show smaller increases in the third and fourth
quarters than did the BLS data, although the NIPA estimate for the
first quarter were released prior to the March BLS data. In the
first quarter, prices increased in all major non-oil import
categories. Over the past four quarters, changes in import prices
have been associated with movements in the dollar, and perhaps more
recently with an anticipated rise in domestic demand.
Prices of non-agricultural exports rose slightly in March but
for the first quarter declined by 1.1 percent (AR). This price
decline came about as a large and continuing decline in the price of
exports of industrial supplies of 6.4 percent more than offset a 5.9
percent rise in the price of exports of consumer goods.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
For the first quarter, foreign official reserves held in the
United States rose by almost $21 billion (line 4 of the Summary of
U.S. International Transactions table). As was the case throughout
1991, the increases were concentrated in countries other than the
G-10 and OPEC; notable increases were registered by Taiwan and
Mexico. Among the G-10, Germany showed a substantial increase and
Japan a moderate decrease.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities (lines 2a, 2b
and 3) were dominated by nearly $8 billion in net purchases of U.S.
corporate and agency bonds (line 2a). These foreign purchases
accompanied a very high level of bond issuance by U.S. corporations.
On the other hand, private foreigners made net sales of U.S. stocks
amounting to almost $3 billion and reduced their holdings of U.S.
Treasury securities another $0.5 billion (lines 2b and 3).
These latter changes were more than accounted for by reductions
in Japanese residents' holdings of U.S. stocks and Treasury
securities. In the first quarter, Japanese residents sold net over
$3 billion of U.S. stocks ($500 million in March) and almost $4
billion of U.S. Treasury securities ($2 billion in March); they also
reduced their holdings of corporate bonds slightly.
U.S. residents continued their high level of purchases of
foreign securities, totaling over $9 billion in the first quarter
(line 2c). Almost $8 billion of the total was for foreign stocks,
including $1-1/2 billion for Japanese stocks.
In contrast to the capital outflows associated with the
adjustment of Japanese portfolios of U.S. stocks and bonds, there
were large inflows from Japan into banks located in the United
States--$12 billion in the first quarter and $9 billion in March

alone. Approximately $5 billion of the net inflow from Japan in the
first quarter was to Japanese agencies and branches in the United
States or their IBFs (over $7 billion in March). This latter first-
quarter inflow largely reflected a reduction of the claims of
Japanese banks in the United States on unaffiliated banks in Japan,
possibly in response to pressures imposed by capital adequacy
guidelines. Bank-reported transactions with other regions showed a
net outflow in the first quarter, as the net inflow overall was only
about $4 billion (line 1 of the Summary table). For April, monthly
average data reported on the International Banking Data table
indicate a continued inflow from own foreign offices and IBFs (line
1); this is more than accounted for by the net inflow to U.S.
offices of foreign-chartered banks (mostly Japanese) from their IBFs
and offices abroad (line 1b).

Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade weighted average value of the dollar, shown in the
figure, declined just over 2-1/2 percent, on balance, from the March
FOMC meeting through May 13. The dollar's movements during most of
the period have been influenced by concerns over the prospects for
the U.S. recovery. Early in the period, the dollar declined on the
basis of weaker than expected employment data for March, and the
subsequent Federal Reserve easing. Toward the end of the period the
dollar continued to decline as the market has come to expect further
Federal Reserve easing.
Events in Germany and Japan also had a significant influence on
exchange rates, especially in the second half of the period. The
mark appreciated against the dollar as high levels of German M3
growth and the possibility of large wage increases in current labor
negotiations postponed the possibility of lower rates in Germany.
M3 growth in March was 9.7 percent over the fourth-quarter base,
well above the Bundesbank's growth target of 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent.
In addition, German public sector workers tentatively agreed agreed
to a package that would increase compensation by 5.7 percent.
The yen strengthened against the dollar following the April 26
G-7 meeting, as the G-7 communique and comments by finance ministers
in the aftermath of the meeting characterized the yen's recent
weakness and the large Japanese trade surplus as a matter of
concern. The Bank of Japan also intervened on several occasions
following the G-7 meeting to support the yen.
An additional concern during the period has been the weakness
of Japan's economy and equity markets. On April 1, the day after
the last FOMC meeting, Japanese officials announced an emergency

fiscal package to support Japan's economy. On the following day the
official discount rate was cut by 75 basis points. Despite these
measures, and minor additional measures aimed specifically at
supporting the stock market, the Nikkei stock index declined sharply
and had been as much as 10-1/2 percent below its level at the
beginning of the intermeeting period. However, the Nikkei index
later recovered and was unchanged, on balance, during the period.
Interest rates during the period remained steady in Germany. In
Japan, since the end of March, the call money rate eased 90 basis
points in response to Bank of Japan easing; the three-month rate
declined by only 10 basis points as Japan's easing action had been
largely discounted by market participants; and the yield on the
bellwether bond increased by about 15 basis points. This bond yield
increase may be partly attributable to the weakness of Japan's stock
market. The stock market's weakness has reduced the attractiveness
of corporate financing through the use of equity and equity-linked
securities such as convertible and warrant linked bonds. The
reduced attraction of equity financing has placed upward pressure on
yields for other types of financing, including bond financing.
In Canada, the call money rate and three-month rate both
declined about 75 basis points during the period, and the yield on
the bellwether bond declined by about 40 basis points. These rate
declines contributed to the weakness of the Canadian dollar, which
has fallen about 3/4 percent against the U.S. dollar.
In Europe, the Portuguese escudo entered the ERM in a +/- 6
percent exchange rate band. The other major developments in Europe
during the period were the reduction in British interest rates
following the Conservative Party's surprise election victory, and
the announcement by the Bank of France of a reduction in reserve
requirements.

IV-13
Sterling, which had been weakened by political uncertainty
during the period leading up to the election on April 9,
strengthened significantly after the election. Sterling's strength
prompted the Bank of England to lower its money market dealing rates
50 basis points. On balance, financial markets have responded
positively to the Conservative's election victory. During the
intermeeting period sterling rose 5-1/2 percent against the dollar
and 3-1/2 percent against the mark, stock prices in the United
Kingdom rose nearly 14 percent, and the yield on the bellwether bond
declined about 3/4 of a percentage point.
The Bank of France announced a reduction in reserve
requirements towards the end of the period. Although the Bank of
France did not reduce official interest rates, commercial banks
reduced their base rates by 50 basis points, perhaps in anticipation
of a forthcoming cut in official rates. Three-month interest rates
have declined by about 15 basis points since the announcement. The
French franc was little affected by the reduction in reserve
requirements, and appreciated about 1 percent against the mark
during the intermeeting period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Indicators of economic activity were mixed in the first quarter
of 1992, as signs of recovery in economic activity in Europe were
offset by continued weakness in Japan and Canada. Recent
estimates indicate that German GDP increased 6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
the first quarter, following a decline in the previous quarter.
However, part of this increase was attributed to effects of

IV-14
exceptionally warm weather on construction activity. Monthly
indicators in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom point, on
balance, to a recovery in output in the first quarter. In contrast,
in Japan and Canada most monthly indicators declined.
Inflation rates have been relatively stable in all the foreign
G-7 countries except Germany. German wage inflation has increased
significantly over the past year, and wage negotiations between the
government, industry, and the unions suggest that wages will
continue to be a source of inflationary pressure in 1992.
National elections in the United Kingdom returned the
Conservative Party to power, though with a reduced majority. In
Italy, a sharp drop in support for the ruling four-party coalition
in national elections and the resignation of President Cossiga is
making the formation of a new government difficult. The 15
republics of the former Soviet Union became members of the IMF. The
Russian government intends to allow the ruble to float and make it
convertible for current account transactions on July 1, and to
stabilize the ruble in the fall.
Individual country notes. In Japan, activity appears to have
remained weak in the first quarter. Industrial production (s.a.)
declined 2.8 percent in March and 3.3 percent for the first quarter
as a whole. The inventory to shipments ratio (s.a.) increased 1.2
percent in March and was 9.2 percent above its year-earlier level.
Retail sales at large department stores (s.a.) in March were 1
percent below their year-earlier level, the first such decline in
three years. In February, new manufacturing orders (s.a.) declined
1.7 percent, and housing starts (s.a.) were down by 1.2 percent.
The unemployment rate (s.a.) was 2 percent in February, unchanged
from its year-earlier level. However, the job-

offers-to-applicants ratio (s.a.) declined 2.3 percent in February
and was 14.4 percent below its year-earlier level.
Consumer prices in the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) in April rose 1.1
percent and were 2.9 percent above their year-earlier level.
However, when perishable foods are excluded, the monthly increase
was only 0.3 percent (s.a.). Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) increased
0.3 percent in March, but were down 1.4 percent from their year-
earlier level.
The trade surplus rose in the first quarter to $112 billion
(s.a.a.r.) from $88 billion in the fourth quarter.
Equity prices dropped sharply in April. Since the March FOMC,
the Nikkei index was unchanged, on balance. Real estate prices have
also continued to fall; the National Land Agency recently announced
that land prices fell roughly 5 percent in 1991, the first decline
in 17 years.
On March 31, the government announced a package of measures
aimed at boosting the pace of economic activity. The overall
macroeconomic impact of these measures appears to be fairly small,
with the most significant change consisting of a shift in budgeted
spending into the first half of the current fiscal year, which began
April 1.
Recent estimates of West German GNP indicate an increase of
roughly 6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, following a fall
of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter. However, this increase was
largely due to special factors, and may be partially reversed in the
second quarter. A large first-quarter increase in West German
industrial production (s.a.) of 2.4 percent was also largely due to
these special factors. Construction activity increased 4.4 percent
in the first quarter of 1991, largely due to mild weather. Looking
through these special factors, the level of economic activity at the

IV-19
end of the first quarter was up only modestly from the fourth
quarter of 1991.
The volume of new orders for west German manufactured goods
(s.a.) increased sharply in January and February. Domestic orders
(including orders from eastern Germany) increased 6.6 percent in
January and 0.1 percent in February, after falling 4.9 percent in
December. Foreign orders also increased significantly. Labor
market conditions in west Germany remain tight. The west German
unemployment rate (s.a.) rose to 6.4 percent in April from 6.3
percent in March.
Evidence of recovery in eastern Germany continues to
accumulate. East German industrial production (n.s.a.) increased
5.3 percent in the fourth quarter, while new orders for east German
manufactured goods jumped 7.9 percent. Unofficial data indicate
that output per hour in east German industry increased by 76 percent
between January and December of last year, fully offsetting the
impact of wage increases on unit labor costs. Surveys of investment
intentions indicate that gross fixed investment in eastern Germany
is expected to increase between one quarter and one third in 1992,
and continue to show growing optimism regarding business conditions
in 1992.
Consumer prices in western Germany (s.a.) in April were 4.6
percent above their year-earlier level, down only slightly from
their 4.7 percent rise in March. Over the three months to April,
consumer prices increased at an annual rate of 3.9 percent, compared
with 3.3 percent for the three-month period ending in December.
Accelerating labor costs in western Germany continue to be a
source of concern. Average hourly earnings in western Germany
(s.a.) increased 7.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the six months between
August and February, compared with an increase of 5.9 percent during

IV-20
the six months to August 1991. On May 7, the government and the
public-sector unions agreed on a 5.4 percent wage increase with
additional payments worth about 1/4 percentage point, slightly less
than what was proposed by an arbitration panel three weeks ago.
Negotiations between the metalworkers union--IG Metall--and
employers remain deadlocked. After a series of warning strikes
during the past two weeks, union officials threatened to call a vote
on a full-scale strike.
M3 (s.a.) increased at an annual rate of 9.7 percent in the
first quarter. This relatively rapid M3 growth was largely due to
strong demand for bank loans.
In France, economic activity showed renewed signs of strength
in the first quarter following a slowdown in real total GDP growth
to 0.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter (from a revised 4
percent in the third quarter). Consumption of manufactured
products, equal to roughly one-third of total consumption, rose 0.9
percent (s.a.) in the first quarter. Industrial production fell 0.9
percent (s.a) in February, following a strong 2 percent increase in
January. The February decline resulted from a sharp drop in energy
output due to unusually warm weather, and industrial production
excluding energy rose slightly. Business orders and retail sales
were flat in March, after increasing in January and February. The
government statistical institute, INSEE, raised its forecast for
growth in the first half of 1992 to 2-1/2 percent, although survey
data indicate that investment is likely to remain stagnant in the
first half of 1992. Unemployment remained constant in March, after
rising to 9.9 percent in February.
Consumer prices in March were 3.2 percent above their level a
year earlier, up from 3 percent in the previous month.

IV-21
The sharp drop in support for the governing Socialist Party in
regional elections held on March 22 led President Mitterrand to
replace Prime Minister Cresson with former Finance Minister Pierre
Beregovoy. The Finance Ministry was reorganized so that the
Ministers of the Budget and of Industry report directly to Beregovoy
rather to the new Finance Minister, Michel Sapin, thereby
maintaining Beregovoy's influence over economic policy.
Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy announced a sharp increase in
the estimate of the 1992 central government budget deficit from FF90
billion (1.2 percent of GDP) to FF135 billion (2 percent of GDP).
This revision was primarily due to a reduction in estimated tax
receipts in response to lower-than-anticipated receipts in 1991. He
also stated that the increase in expenditures would be limited to
3.5 percent, but that automatic stabilizers would be allowed to
operate. Revenues from privatization and budgetary saving from an
expenditure freeze in non-priority areas will be used to finance new
training programs to reduce unemployment and a cut in the VAT on
luxury items and cars from 22 to 18.6 percent. The VAT cut was
moved forward one year to provide some mild fiscal stimulus.
In Italy, the economy appears to be growing sluggishly.
Fourth-quarter GDP rose 1.2 percent (s.a.a.r.), up from 0.8 percent
in the previous quarter. The average level of industrial production
(n.s.a.) in January and February, adjusted for the number of working
days, was 0.6 percent above its year-earlier level. Auto sales in
March were 2.1 percent above their year-earlier level, following an
increase in February of 3.7 percent. Household confidence rose
sharply in March, following a decline in the previous month.
Consumer prices in April were 5.5 percent above their year-
earlier level, the same as the March increase. Wholesale prices in
February were 0.4 percent above their year-earlier level.

IV-22
Italy's ruling four-party coalition suffered a setback in the
general election held in early April when its share of the vote fell
five percentage points. The coalition did retain a slim majority in
Parliament but, given relatively weak party discipline, is not
likely to be able to form a government strong enough to enact
necessary economic reforms. The big winner was the Lombard League,
a regional party based in the north that favors greater autonomy for
northern Italy. It gained 8.7 percent of the vote, up from 0.5
percent in 1987. The political situation was further complicated by
the resignation of President Cossiga in late April, two months
before the end of his term; the president plays a role in selecting
the premier.
In the United Kingdom, recent data point to a moderate recovery
in economic activity. The Purchasing Managers' Index (based on new
orders, output, and employment) rose in April for the third month in
a row. Business failures in April dropped to their lowest level
since December 1990. Survey data indicate that consumer and
business confidence recovered in the first quarter. Also, the
financial positions of the personal and corporate sectors have
improved, leaving them in better shape to increase spending.
However, the volume of retail sales (s.a.) in the first quarter was
only slightly above that of the fourth quarter, as a decline in
March almost offset modest rises of the previous two months.
Unemployment (s.a.) stabilized in March at 9.4 percent. Industrial
production (s.a.) in February rose 1.2 percent, after declining 1.4
percent the previous month.
The inflation rate has more than halved during the past year;
consumer prices (n.s.a.) rose 4 percent in March from their year-
earlier level, compared with an increase of 8.2 percent in March
1991. Excluding mortgage interest rates, consumer prices in March

IV-23
stood 5.7 percent above their year-earlier level. Producers' output
prices were up 0.4 percent in April, to stand 3.8 percent above
year-earlier levels. Wages continued to increase at an underlying
rate of 7-1/4 percent in February. However, recent wage settlements
have been below 5 percent.
The Conservative Party retained power in the general election
held April 9, winning 336 seats for an overall majority of 21 seats,
down from their previous majority of 84, but sufficient to ensure
five more years of Conservative government. Prime Minister Major
announced that Norman Lamont would remain Chancellor of the
Exchequer and appointed Michael Heseltine head of the Department of
Trade and Industry. After spending several months near the bottom
of the ERM, the pound rallied following the election, while the
stock market has soared almost 13 percent.
In Canada, first-quarter data show continued weakness on
balance. Average industrial production (s.a.) in January and
February was 0.9 percent below its fourth-quarter average. January
and February retail sales (s.a.) were virtually unchanged from their
low December level, and motor vehicle sales (s.a.) slipped 4.7
percent in February. However, housing starts rose 11 percent (s.a.)
in April, after plunging 17 percent in the first quarter. Factory
shipments (s.a.) rose 1.1 percent in February, and new orders (s.a.)
were up 2.2 percent in February, the first increase in six months in
either measure. Unemployment (s.a.) in April fell slightly to 11
percent, from 11.1 percent in March, but remains above 1991 levels.
Canada's inflation performance continues to improve. The CPI
increased only 1.6 percent in the first quarter from its level a
year earlier, though excluding food and energy the increase was 2.6
percent. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) stand 2.4 percent lower than
their year-earlier level.

IV-24
There is substantial uncertainty about Canada's political
future due to a lack of agreement on constitutional reform, and the
secession of Quebec is a possibility. The provincial government of
Quebec has promised to hold a referendum on "Quebec sovereignty" by
the end of October if it is not satisfied with the constitutional
amendments that the federal government is to submit to parliament
this month. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney expressed
concern that the wording of this referendum might mislead Quebeckers
into believing that the province could simultaneously become
"sovereign" and remain a part of Canada, and that he might be forced
to preempt the Quebec referendum with a Canada-wide plebiscite.
Developments in East European Countries
The applications of Russia and the other 14 republics of the
former Soviet Union to join the IMF were approved by the IMF
Executive Board in early May. Russia's quota is 3 percent, while
the 14 other republics combined will receive 1.76 percent. Russia
is the most advanced in its economic reform efforts and could be
expected to draw from the IMF perhaps as early as this summer.
At the Congress of People's Deputies meeting in early April,
the Russian government's program came under criticism from
conservative anti-market forces. In response, the government
modified certain aspects of the program, but stressed that this
would not undermine the overall reform effort. These changes
include loosening of central bank credit to commercial banks,
selective loosening of fiscal policy, and increased emphasis on
restructuring of industry. In early May, the Russian government
announced that the ruble would become convertible for current
account transactions and will be allowed to float beginning July 1.
In the fall, a fixed central exchange rate will be established, and
the ruble will be allowed to fluctuate around this central rate

IV-25
within a 15 percent band. The Russian government hopes that the $6
billion ruble stabilization fund recently endorsed by the G-10 will
contribute to confidence in the ruble. The stabilization fund will
only be activated after Russia has obtained a stand-by program from
the IMF, and will be financed through the IMF's General Arrangements
to Borrow (GAB).
In Poland, on May 6, Finance Minister Andrzej Olechowski
resigned when the parliament cancelled two 1991 laws that would have
limited state pensions and public employee salaries. The 1991 laws
had been ruled unconstitutional by a judicial tribunal and the
parliament failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to
overturn the tribunal's decision and enact the laws. The
parliament's decision to allow large increases in government
spending will push the 1992 budget deficit well above the 5 percent
of GDP target contained in the government's program that was
endorsed, in principle, by the IMF. If the measures are not
reversed, it will be difficult to reach an agreement with the IMF on
a new program.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
Mexico is expected to receive a one-year extension of the
three-year EFF arrangement with the IMF that was due to expire May
25. Because international reserves have increased significantly to
$17.7 billion at end-1991, Mexican officials have told the IMF that
they would not draw on the additional resources unless conditions
worsen. Argentina and the Bank Advisory Committee have reached
preliminary agreement on a Brady Plan debt restructuring. Argentina
is believed to have met its first-quarter fiscal targets under the
EFF arrangement that the IMF approved in March. Brazil appears to
have missed its first-quarter fiscal targets under the IMF stand-by
arrangement approved in January. Negotiations with its commercial

IV-26
bank creditors on a Brady Plan debt restructuring continue to be
stalled over disagreement concerning the amount that Brazil should
initially provide in enhancements. Economic activity remains strong
in Korea and in Taiwan, as well as in Mexico and Argentina.
Individual country notes. Mexico has asked the IMF to extend
for one year the three-year EFF arrangement that was due to expire
May 25. IMF Executive Board approval is expected May 20. The
option to extend the EFF for a fourth year was agreed between the
IMF and Mexico when the EFF was approved in 1989. The Mexican
authorities have told the IMF that, barring unforeseen adverse
developments, they do not intend to use the SDR 466.2 million (about
$640 million) in resources that would be made available by the
extension.
Mexico's 1991 current account deficit was $13.3 billion, up
from $7.1 billion in 1990, because the trade deficit widened to $6.9
billion from $0.8 billion in 1990. However, international reserves,
excluding gold, rose by $7.9 billion during the year and stood at
$17.7 billion at year-end, thanks to a capital account surplus of
about $21 billion.
The capital account surplus included foreign investment inflows
of $12.3 billion, of which $4.8 billion were direct investments and
$7.5 billion were portfolio investments. Mexican commercial banks
also borrowed more than $5 billion in international markets, mainly
through Euro-CD placements. Because nearly half of these CDs have
maturities of under a year and because banks used a large proportion
of the funds raised through these placements to make peso loans, the
Bank of Mexico worried about the disruptions to the economy that
could result from a sudden loss of investor confidence in Mexican
assets. Accordingly, on April 1, it required that at least 15
percent of the bank funds raised abroad be invested in liquid

IV-27
foreign securities and that the rest be lent in foreign currency to
companies that have foreign-currency earnings. To cushion the
impact of this measure on Mexican banks, the Bank bought back from
banks 4 percent of the 10-year peso government bonds that banks must
hold in an amount equivalent to 25 percent of their August 1991
deposits.
The 28-day Treasury bill rate rose from 11 percent at the March
10 auction to 13.3 percent at the May 6 auction. The increase
reflected a reported withdrawal of foreign funds from Mexico that
brokers attributed to Japanese year-end window-dressing in the last
half of March and, more recently, to growing pessimism regarding the
prospects for an early signing of a North American Free Trade
Agreement. The higher interest rates also reflected increased
doubts that inflation can be reduced to less than 10 percent this
year, as forecast by the government. The CPI rose by 1 percent in
March and by 0.9 percent in April, when it was still 16.7 percent
higher than a year earlier.
The peso/dollar exchange rate moved closer to the mid-point of
the range within which the peso has been floating in late April and
in early May. (Over the past few months, the peso/dollar rate had
remained close to the more appreciated end of the range.)
Business surveys indicate that the manufacturing sector is
optimistic concerning the business climate in 1992. Private sources
forecast real GDP growth at 4.4 percent in 1992, compared with real
GDP growth of 3.6 percent in 1991.
On April 7, Argentina and the Bank Advisory Committee reached
preliminary agreement on a Brady Plan debt restructuring. To
normalize the status of approximately $8 billion in interest
arrears, Argentina has agreed to make a downpayment of $400 million
in cash and to deliver Argentine zero-coupon bonds, fully backed by

IV-28
U.S. Treasury bonds, with a present value of $300 million; the
remaining $7.3 billion of the arrears will be converted into 12-year
non-collateralized bonds paying LIBOR plus 13/16 percent interest.
About $23 billion in principal will be exchanged, at the option of
the banks, for either (1) a 30-year discount bond, to be issued at
65 percent of the face value of the original debt, paying LIBOR +
13/16 percent interest; or (2) a 30-year bond to be issued at par
with an interest rate rising in steps from 4 percent in the first
year to 6 percent after 6 years. The principal and 12 months'
interest payments (on a rolling basis) for both options will be
collateralized. Individual banks are currently subscribing to the
new package.
The consumer price index rose 1.3 percent in April, continuing
the deceleration since January. Industrial production in the first
quarter of 1992 was 17 percent above its year-earlier level.
Argentina is believed to have met its 1992 first-quarter fiscal
target under the IMF Extended Fund Facility approved in March. It
was especially successful in raising revenues from asset sales. The
March 22 auction to the public of the government's remaining 30
percent stake in the northern half of the privatized phone company
earned $1.2 billion. This was well over the $850 million in revenue
earned from the December 1991 sale of the government's remaining
shares in the southern half of the privatized phone company.
Brazil appears to have missed its first-quarter fiscal targets
under the IMF stand-by arrangement approved last January. As a
result, a formal performance review is not likely to take place and
the second tranche from the stand-by is not likely to be disbursed.
Brazilian officials have told IMF management that they are confident
that fiscal performance will improve by the end of June. Fund

IV-29
management is expected to wait and see whether the fiscal picture
improves by June before further disbursements are considered.
Much of the first-quarter fiscal shortfall is the result of a
14 percent drop in the federal government's tax revenues, partly
because changes in the Brazilian tax code have reduced taxable
corporate profits. In addition, revenues accruing from an important
sales tax have been put into an escrow account because the
constitutionality of the tax has been challenged. The continued
stagnation in economic activity may also have resulted in a more-
than-anticipated fall in tax receipts. The government's cost of
servicing its domestic debt has also exceeded expectations.
The consumer price index rose 20.8 percent in April compared
with an increase of 21.6 percent in March.
Negotiations with commercial bank creditors continue to be
stalled because of disagreement on the initial enhancement money
that Brazil should provide to close a deal. Estimates of the total
cost of providing enhancements vary from $4.6 billion to close to $6
billion. On May 11, Brazil proposed to provide as much as $1.4
billion from its international reserves in initial enhancement
funds, but this outlay would be contingent upon Brazil securing at
least $1.6 billion in a combination of new money and initial
enhancements from IFIs. The rest of the money required for
enhancements would be phased in over time. So far, banks have
expressed skepticism that Brazil will be able to secure the initial
enhancement funds.
The banks have been pressing Brazil to commit $3.5 billion in
initial enhancement money, in part, because international reserves
have risen from $9 billion at end-November 1991 to an estimated $14
billion in early May, thanks to heavy capital inflows. Capital
inflows have resulted from the central bank's policy of maintaining

IV-30
interest rates at very high levels. In April, the central bank
lowered interest rates, apparently, in part, to slow capital
inflows. Brazilian officials have been worried about the potential
for a destabilizing attack on reserves, particularly because much of
the capital inflows have been in short-term instruments. In early
May, the central bank announced that it would intervene when
necessary to stabilize the foreign exchange market.
Brazil's cumulative trade surplus for the year through March
1992 was $3.5 billion, compared with a surplus of $2.4 billion for
the same period in 1991.
Korea's GNP rose an estimated 7.6 percent in the first quarter
of 1992 from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 8.7
percent in the first quarter of 1991 from a year earlier. Korea's
first-quarter 1992 current account deficit fell to $3.2 billion from
$3.8 billion in the first quarter of 1991 due to a pickup in
exports. Inflation has fallen off somewhat this year; consumer
prices were 7.2 percent higher in April than a year earlier, down
from 10.1 percent in the year ending April 1991.
In Taiwan, industrial production increased 5.4 percent in the
first quarter of 1992, nearly unchanged from the rate of expansion
in the first quarter of 1991. Price developments are mixed; in
April, consumer prices were up 6.1 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 3.5 percent increase in the year ending April 1991,
while wholesale prices fell 3.5 percent compared with an increase of
2.7 percent in the year ending April 1991. In part due to the April
consumer price data, Taiwan's central bank increased its rediscount
rate by one fourth percentage point to 6-1/8 percent on May 9, the
first increase since August 1989. Taiwan's trade surplus in the
first four months expanded to $4 billion from $1.9 billion in the

IV-31
same period of 1991, as export growth picked up and import growth
slowed.
