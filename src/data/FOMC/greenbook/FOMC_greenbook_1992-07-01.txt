The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity evidently increased somewhat further this
spring, buttressed by improved sales and production of motor
vehicles. Other segments of private final demand have been mixed,
with nonauto retail sales and housing starts dropping below their
early-year levels while strong computer shipments continued to boost
overall equipment sales. Employment has trended upward, but, with a
sizable increase in the labor force, the unemployment rate has
reached a new cyclical high. The considerable slack remaining in
the economy has damped increases in wages and prices.
Labor Market Developments
Total payroll employment rose for the fourth straight month in
May, and the average workweek of all production or nonsupervisory
workers edged up to 34.5 hours; all told, aggregate hours increased
0.5 percent, more than offsetting declines in the previous two
months. The level of aggregate hours in May stood 0.6 percent (not
at an annual rate) higher than the first-quarter average.
The service-producing sector continued to dominate hiring in
May. Indeed, an increase of 109,000 in the services industry more
than accounted for the 68,000 increment to total jobs. The hiring
in this industry reflected, in part, further additions in business
services, where gains averaged about 35,000 per month from February
through May. Because business service firms are hired by companies
throughout the economy, this rise may be signaling improvement in a
variety of sectors. Nonetheless, the increase in business services
employment may also indicate that firms remain hesitant to hire
permanent workers and are resorting to temporary employees until
confidence improves. Employment in retail trade fell in May and has
shown no clear trend since the beginning of the year.

In manufacturing, employment slid 10,000 despite the return to
work of about 12,000 workers at Caterpillar. However, the
manufacturing workweek continued to rise steadily, reflecting
increases in overtime hours, and now stands slightly above pre-
recession levels. This combination of a relatively long workweek
and weak employment is another indication that manufacturers are so
far responding cautiously to a gradual increase in demand.
In the May household report, the civilian unemployment rate
jumped 0.3 percentage point to 7.5 percent. Employment was
essentially unchanged after having risen substantially in prior
months, and the number of unemployed increased nearly 350,000.
About half of the rise in joblessness occurred among persons aged 16
to 24. Large seasonal flows of these workers into the labor market
occur between May and July; this May's increase in summer jobseekers
appears to have been larger than the seasonal factors anticipated.
To the extent that the seasonal entry of these workers into the
labor force occurred earlier than usual, the effect could well be
reversed in coming months. However, the May household survey showed
somewhat broader signs of weakness than had been apparent in earlier
months. The unemployment rate for men above the age of 24 also
jumped, the share of the unemployed who were job losers increased
again, and the number working part-time for economic reasons rose as
well.
The labor force participation rate moved up to 66.5 percent in
May, returning to near its pre-recession level. Indeed, the most
striking aspect of the household survey since late last year has
been the addition to the labor force of about 300,000 persons per
month. This rise in the participation rate has been concentrated
among young females and adult males (chart). By contrast, the rate
for young males, which dropped during the recession, has not

II-6
increased this year; and the rate for adult females, which leveled
off during the recession, has only edged up since the beginning of
the year. Some of the recent labor market entry may have been due
to improved perceptions about the likelihood of finding a job, the
Conference Board's May consumer survey showed that fewer respondents
thought jobs were "hard to get" than at any time since September.
Taken as a whole, the data from the May labor market surveys
showed continued slow improvement in labor demand. Since the mid-
May reference week for those surveys, initial claims for
unemployment insurance continued to fluctuate within the lower range
established in April and early May.
The payroll employment data now have been officially
benchmarked to more comprehensive counts of employment that were
derived primarily from unemployment insurance tax records for March
1991. As expected, the level of payroll employment in March 1991
was revised down 640,000 (before seasonal adjustment). This
revision was very large by historical standards--roughly three times
as large as the average revision over the past ten years (table).

1. The revisions, typically released in June of the following
year, benchmarked the level of payroll employment to unemployment
insurance records for March of the year indicated.
Much of the discrepancy between the monthly pre-revision payroll
estimates and the unemployment insurance records apparently occurred
in January 1991, a month in which many states introduced
improvements to the way employers fill out their unemployment
insurance reports. We believe that much of the downward revision

II-7
reflects this technical improvement, rather than a dramatic drop in
actual employment around January of 1991.
Employment as measured by the household survey has strongly
outpaced payroll employment over the past year; together with the
historical pattern of payroll survey revisions early in economic
expansions, this suggests that next year's benchmark revisions may
show some upward revision to payroll employment in the period since
March 1991.
Payroll data on average hourly earnings for production or
nonsupervisory workers in May suggest that wage increases are
continuing to slow. Average hourly earnings were reported to have
increased 0.3 percent in May, after a 0.2 percent decline in April.
Over the twelve months ended in May, average hourly earnings were up
just 2.5 percent, about 3/4 percentage point below the previous
twelve-month period. The underlying wage deceleration may even be

somewhat understated because of the decline and subsequent rise in
overtime hours within manufacturing; because overtime hours are
typically paid a premium wage, that pattern held down average hourly
earnings during the recession and is boosting them now. However,

Industrial Production
According to our initial estimate, the index of industrial
production rose 0.6 percent in May, slightly faster than in the
three previous months. Output in May was boosted by increases in
motor vehicle assemblies, as well as by large gains in production of
other consumer durables and business equipment. The May pickup in
production of durable goods other than motor vehicles follows a
strengthening earlier in the year of adjusted durable goods orders.

Motor vehicle assemblies moved up to 10.2 million units (annual

production of related parts and materials also has improved in
recent months. Assemblies in June are running at about that same
level, and schedules call for a further increase to an average of
10.8 million units (annual rate) for the third quarter as a whole.
With inventories at relatively comfortable levels, the recent
firming in sales makes those schedules look realistic.

1. Components may not add to totals due to rounding.
Production of durable consumer goods excluding motor vehicles
increased 2.4 percent in May; the increase was broadly based, with
particular strength in household appliances and furniture. Among
consumer nondurables, output of both clothing and food items edged
down 0.1 percent, and consumer energy production declined
0.9 percent in May, likely owing to cool weather.
Production of business equipment excluding autos and trucks
rose 1 percent in May. More than half of this increase originated
in the industrial equipment sector, where output increased
3.1 percent, owing chiefly to the end of the strike at Caterpillar.
Nonetheless, even abstracting from this one-time effect, production
of industrial equipment apparently grew moderately in May.
Materials production moved up steadily for the fourth straight
month in May, with broad-based gains among all categories of durable
materials. Output of durable materials rose 0.9 percent in May,
boosted by strong demand for parts and supplies used in equipment
and consumer durables. Nondurable materials output was little
changed; increases in production of textiles and chemicals were
offset by a drop in the output of paper.
For the manufacturing sector as a whole, the recent increases
in production have boosted capacity utilization to 78.1 percent.
Nonetheless, considerable slack still is evident: Current
utilization is a bit below the operating rate of July 1991--when the

Personal Income and Consumption
Real personal consumption has failed to sustain the higher
level reached in the January-February burst of spending. But while
nonauto retail sales are estimated to have been weak from March
through May, some positive signs have emerged recently in the
consumer sector. Notably, against a backdrop of improved
confidence, rising employment, and lower loan rates, the demand for
new motor vehicles has strengthened. With expenditures on services
continuing to post moderate increases, total real PCE appears headed
for a small gain in the current quarter.
Nominal personal income barely rose in April, after sizable
gains the previous two months. Private wages and salaries were
about unchanged, while personal interest income fell for the
sixteenth consecutive month. Transfer payments, proprietors'
income, and other labor income posted small gains. After accounting
for taxes and inflation, real disposable personal income declined a
bit in April. The picture for May appears better. Last month's
labor market report points to a strong rebound in wages and
salaries, and we estimate the April-May average of nominal wages and
salaries to have been 1 percent (not at an annual rate) above the
first-quarter average. With consumption prices up about 0.2 percent
over the same period, real labor income seems likely to post an
increase for the quarter.
Total nominal retail sales increased just 0.2 percent in May.
Sales in the retail control category--which excludes spending at
automotive dealers and at building material and supply stores--
hardly changed. These sales figures suggest that real personal
consumption expenditures on goods other than motor vehicles in April

and May were roughly a quarter percent (not at an annual rate) below
the average in the first three months of this year. By contrast,
real expenditures on services have continued to rise by 2 to 3
percent (annual rate) in recent quarters; beginning in June, the
transportation component of services spending should receive some
additional impetus from the surge in air travel that is expected to
result from recent cuts in airfares.
Sales of autos and light trucks rose in May to almost
13 million units at an annual rate.. Sales of light trucks posted
the fourth consecutive monthly increase, reaching a 4.6 million unit
rate, a pace not seen since the autumn of 1989. Auto sales also
rose, but more modestly, to an 8.4 million unit rate--still shy of
February levels. The strong May performance did not appear to be
the result of any special factors (such as enhanced incentive
programs). Sales of domestically produced light vehicles in the
first 20-day period of June continued strong, outpacing the level
for May by 1/2 million units.
The increase in light vehicle demand for May was met by
vehicles produced by the Big Three; sales of vehicles with foreign
nameplates remained close to April levels. Price increases on
Japanese vehicles, announced in March, took effect in April and May,
and perhaps contributed to the increase in Big Three market share.
Although the price increases averaged only 2.8 percent, the data
suggest that consumers may have reacted to the highly publicized
increases. Of the six largest Japanese automakers, Subaru was the
only firm to run customer incentive programs in May and was one of
only two Japanese automakers to maintain market share. Mazda, which
posted the largest price increase of 5.1 percent, experienced the
largest relative drop in market share.

The preliminary reading on the University of Michigan's index
of consumer sentiment edged up slightly in the first half of June,
due to a more favorable assessment of current conditions;
expectations about future conditions were virtually unchanged. Most
of the detailed components of the survey (not included in the index)
were little changed, but consumers' appraisals of buying conditions
for cars and large household appliances improved sharply.
Housing Markets
The pace of single-family housing activity dropped back this
spring after a surge early in the year, and the underlying trend in
single-family consruction remains difficult to discern. Monthly
readings on housing activity early in the year were distorted by
unseasonably favorable weather and consumers' responses to tax
proposals for first-time buyers. A brief dip of mortgage rates to
near 8 percent also may have temporarily boosted activity. Single-
family home building retreated in April, but then rebounded in May,
to a level of 1.05 million units (annual rate), close to the first-
quarter average. Permit issuance, however, was little changed over
the month, which suggests that the estimated increase in starts may
overstate the actual pickup in construction activity.
1. Issuance of building permits is measured with less sampling
error than is the level of starts, making permit issuance a more
stable indicator of the onset of construction. Almost two-thirds
of all single-family starts in permit-issuing places occur in the
month the permit is issued, and most of the remaining starts occur
in the month following permit issuance.

Sales of new homes were weak in both March and April, even
after allowing for distortions in monthly timing caused by the
weather and tax proposals. The weakness was surprising given the
positive forces at work: Cash-flow burdens of homeownership are at
their lowest levels since the 1970s (chart, top panel), and broader
measures of homeownership costs that attempt to include expectations
of capital gains are near the midpoints of the ranges that have
prevailed over the past decade (middle panel). Consumer attitudes
toward home buying have continued to be quite positive.
Furthermore, household growth remains substantial among the prime
home-buying age groups.
A possible explanation for soft single-family demand may be the
surplus supply of multifamily housing. Vacancy rates for
multifamily rental housing remain well above equilibrium levels in
many local markets, putting downward pressure on rents and enticing
some renters to postpone the move to homeownership. Age-specific
homeownership rates have been declining in recent years, holding the
aggregate ownership rate at 64 percent despite the increasing
concentration of population growth in age groups with above-average
ownership rates.
Although the credit crunch is a possible contributor to the
recent shortfall in starts, an inadequate supply of construction
loans does not appear to be a major factor in the key single-family
market. The proportion of single-family starts that is speculative
construction, which should be most severely affected by lending
constraints, has not fallen much below the cyclical low in the early
1980s. The proportion has stabilized in recent quarters (bottom
panel). Furthermore, if there were important supply constraints on
housing production, those constraints should have been reflected in

upward pressure on house prices. In fact, prices for new homes have
remained soft.
Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for business fixed investment increased 1-3/4
percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, the first rise since
mid-1990. Outlays for computers and office equipment posted another
solid gain last quarter, but business purchases of motor vehicles
continued to decline and outlays for industrial equipment were about
unchanged. Outlays for nonresidential structures continued to fall
in the first quarter, although at a more moderate pace than in the
last two years.
For equipment, the most recent orders and shipments data
suggest a sizable increase in current-quarter spending: Nondefense
capital goods shipments, excluding aircraft, in April and May
averaged close to 3/4 percent above the first-quarter level.
Further increases for office and computing machines account for most
of this rise. Since last fall, the considerable price declines for
these types of goods--that have resulted, in part, from fierce
competition among producers--has stimulated both export and domestic
2demand. In addition, higher business purchases of motor
vehicles are likely contributing to the rebound in sales of autos
and light trucks this quarter.
Shipments of other types of equipment (excluding aircraft),
were about unchanged in April and May relative to the first-
quarter average. Export demand for these types of equipment has
been relatively flat. Domestic spending for these goods, which has
changed little since last fall, usually lags a recovery in overall
2. Price cuts have been reported for a wide range of products,
including workstations and personal computers, and for peripherals
and parts, especially 486 chips. As a result, the April and May
average of the PPI measure of prices for computers fell 17 percent
at an annual rate relative to the first-quarter average.

activity. These outlays tend to be fairly closely correlated with
lagged corporate cash flow over the course of the business cycle
(chart). Hence the recent increase in shipments may partly reflect
the improving cash flow of corporations in the first quarter.
Domestic outlays for aircraft, which averaged $12.5 billion
(1987 dollars, annual rate) during the first three quarters of 1991,
averaged only $7.3 billion in the fourth quarter of last year and
the first quarter of this year. A good part of the decline in
domestic purchases was matched by a surge in exports. In the
current quarter, aircraft deliveries to domestic businesses are
expected to revive somewhat while exports fall back to a more normal
level. Nonetheless, domestic orders for new aircraft have dried up
during the past year, which suggests that, as existing backlogs
decline, domestic purchases will begin to trend lower, maybe
starting later this year.
Outlays for nonresidential structures were little changed in
the first quarter, following a 14-3/4 percent decline in 1991.
Still hampered by an overhang of office space, construction of new
office buildings continued to plummet. The near-term outlook
remains bleak: Coldwell-Banker estimates that the national vacancy
rate for office buildings in March was 19.6 percent, not much
different from the average during the past few years. However,
spending for both industrial and institutional structures has turned
up since late last year, and the descent in other commercial
construction slowed markedly in the first quarter. Looking ahead,
contracts for new construction have firmed over the past year,
suggesting that the worst of the decline in nonresidential building
is behind us.

Business Inventories
Recent data suggest that some businesses are beginning to shift
away from the aggressive liquidation of inventories that has
prevailed since the turn of the year. In manufacturing and trade,
inventory paring is no longer so widespread, and anecdotal reports
indicate that inventories are close to desired levels in most
industries.
The slowing pace of liquidation by April was most notable in
manufacturing, especially when volatile and noncyclical inventory
changes are taken out. Specifically, excluding aircraft and food,
the pace of factory inventory liquidation moderated from a $17.6
billion annual rate in December to a $1.3 billion pace in March;
these stocks edged up $3 billion in April (all figures in current-
cost terms). This appears to have been a planned inventory response
to the firming in industrial production because orders were rising
as inventory liquidation declined. With shipments rising, factory
stock-sales ratios at the end of April were well below their recent
peaks posted last winter. Indeed, for both total manufacturing and
for manufacturing excluding transportation equipment, the overall
ratio in April was the lowest observed in more than a decade (chart,
upper panel).
In the trade sector, wholesale inventories were excessive in
early spring. Inventory liquidation increased in April, especially
at distributors of motor vehicles, machinery, and farm products.
However, inventory-sales ratios remained near the high end of the
range over the past several years, and some further trimming of
stocks is likely in coming months.
In the retail sector, the inventory situation was somewhat more
encouraging this spring. Although retail stocks showed relatively
sharp increases in March and April, more than half of the reported

buildup was reported by auto dealers, where sales of new vehicles
have picked up in recent weeks and inventories of new cars and
trucks still appear fairly comfortable.3 GAF stores also saw
large increases in stocks in March and April: but that rise may have
partly represented some desired rebuilding after the drawdowns in
January and February pushed the inventory-sales ratio for GAF stores
to a near-record low (chart, lower panel, dotted line). From a
broader perspective, the April buildup of nonauto retail stocks was
accompanied by drawdowns upstream in the manufacturing and wholesale
sectors. (For all manufacturing and trade, the net accumulation was
only $3-3/4 billion in April.) On the whole, the inventory-sales
ratio for nonauto retail establishments, was about unchanged in
April, and still well below its recent peak reached in late 1991
(chart, lower panel, solid line).
Federal Government
The federal government recorded a $32 billion unified budget
deficit in April and May combined, up $9 billion from a year
earlier. Excluding contributions to the Defense Cooperation Account
(DCA) and outlays for deposit insurance (DI), the deficit increased
$5 billion; outlays excluding DI and DCA were nearly flat--partly
because of artificially high 1991 outlays--and receipts declined
1.6 percent.
On the tax receipts side of the ledger, withheld taxes were
lower than expected in April and May, but were within the bounds of
normal month-to-month variation. For the fiscal year to date,
3. In estimating GDP, BEA does not use Census survey results for
auto dealers' inventories. Instead, it estimates changes in the
physical stocks of all automotive products based on unit production,
sales, and imports, adjusted for changes in inventories of motor
vehicles in the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors. By this
method of calculation, retail dealers' inventories declined at an

withheld taxes are in line with the year-over-year growth in wages
and salaries and the new withholding schedules that are estimated to
reduce withheld taxes by about $2 billion per month. Nonwithheld
taxes in April and May, which largely represent final settlements on
1991 liabilities, were $4 billion below a year earlier, confirming
the weakness that was recorded earlier in daily Treasury statements.
Detailed data on the source of the shortfall in nonwithheld tax
collections will not be available until the IRS releases its
analysis of 1991 tax returns in 1993. However, one possible
explanation for this drop is that the distress in real estate
markets held down both net capital gains realizations and 1991 tax
liabilities.
Outlays excluding deposit insurance (DI) and the Defense
Cooperation Account (DCA) were up less than 1 percent in April and
May relative to a year earlier. The growth in spending was damped
by shifts in the monthly timing of defense payroll expenditures and
of transfer payments that artificially boosted outlays for the 1991
period by about $6 billion. But even excluding this special factor,
the year-over-year increase in April-May outlays was only about
3 percent, well below the average earlier this fiscal year. After
accounting for the timing of payrolls, defense expenditures in
April-May were down about 10-1/2 percent relative to 1991 and
continue to lag the expenditure pace projected by OMB and CBO
earlier this year.
On May 21 Congress approved a budget resolution for FY1993.
The resolution sets outlays at $1.5 trillion and, using CBO's March
economic assumptions, projects receipts at $1.173 trillion and the
deficit at $327 billion. Relative to the spending caps set in the
1990 budget act, the resolution cuts defense outlays about $7
billion; discretionary domestic spending is at the cap. The budget

II-34
resolution implies a decline between FY1992 and FY1993 in real
defense outlays of about 11 percent and an increase in real
discretionary domestic spending of about 1-1/2 percent. For the
pay-as-you-go category, the budget resolution cuts entitlements by
$2 billion and requires that new tax legislation be revenue-neutral.
Work on detailed budget legislation now begins in the appropriations
committees.
The House rejected a balanced budget amendment to the
Constitution. Immediately after the negative vote, the House
leadership announced plans to begin work on a new deficit-reduction
enforcement bill. In other congressional action, the House and
Senate have passed bills that would maintain temporary extended
unemployment benefits beyond their July 4 expiration date; the House
program would expire at the end of the year, and the Senate program
would expire on March 6, 1993. Both bills also modify the trigger
for regular extended benefits so that it depends on a state's total
unemployment rate, rather than on the insured unemployment rate; the
change, which the Administration has threatened to veto, could make
regular extended benefits more widely available during times of high
unemployment. Also, the Congress passed an emergency supplemental
bill for urban assistance that allocates $756 million to subsidize
disaster loans to businesses and local governments, $500 million
for summer youth employment programs in inner cities nationwide, and
$8 million for law enforcement in Los Angeles. The President is
4. The calculation is based on CBO's March projection for nominal
spending in FY1992. The deflator for real defense spending is from
the Department of Defense, and the deflator for domestic spending is

expected to sign the bill. The Congress is now working on a second
bill for urban enterprise zones and a "weed and seed" program.
State and Local Governments
Indicators of state and local government purchases suggest
renewed weakness in the second quarter, after a large increase in
the first quarter. In April, outlays for real construction fell to
a level 1.6 percent (not at an annual rate) below their first-
quarter average. The largest drop was in expenditures for
educational facilities, which had risen, on net, over the preceding
few months. In contrast to construction, state and local employment
rose in April and May, although most of the gains were due to
temporary hiring for primary elections.
The state and local deficit on operating and capital accounts,
excluding social insurance funds, edged up to $27 billion in the
first quarter, after falling steadily last year. Much of the
deficit reduction last year resulted from the combination of
substantial tax hikes and spending restraint. Also, federal
payments to state and local governments rose appreciably during the
past two years. Essentially all of the acceleration in federal
payments was in grants for Medicaid, which make up about 40 percent
of federal aid to states; grants for all other programs were little
changed (chart). Part of the rise in federal contributions for
Medicaid resulted from tactics used by states to increase the
federal share of Medicaid payments. The federal government has
recently made rule changes designed to reverse some of this increase
in the federal share.
The deficit-correcting actions taken by states this year now
appear smaller than those in 1990 and 1991. Anecdotal reports
6. "Weed and seed" programs coordinate initiatives to improve
public services (primarily education, employment, and health
services) with law enforcement activities to clear neighborhoods of
crime and drugs.

suggest that the states' receipts from increased taxes will be only
around a third of the $15 billion raised in 1991. Meanwhile, on the
spending side, pressures on budgets for education, corrections, and
health remain intense. In particular, outlays for Medicaid continue
to surge, owing in part to the federally mandated expansion of
coverage for children and pregnant women.
Prices
The May CPI report was quite favorable, despite a relatively
large increase in energy prices; food prices retreated, other prices
only edged up, and the overall index rose but 0.1 percent. The CPI
excluding food and energy advanced a modest 0.2 percent in May; our
assessment is that the underlying inflation rate for this "core"
component of the CPI is currently running at a little less than
4 percent, about a half percentage point below the pace in 1991. By
contrast, the PPI for finished goods moved up more rapidly in May
than earlier this year not only because of higher energy prices but
also because of anomalous jumps in prices of cigarettes and
aircraft. Those increases accounted for most of the 0.6 percent
increase in the PPI excluding food and energy.
Both spot and posted prices of crude oil have been rising since
February, and they moved up sharply late last month when OPEC
ministers agreed to leave the production ceiling unchanged in the
third quarter. The OPEC action came too late to affect the May CPI
and PPI; the May increases in the energy components of the CPI and
7. This spring, manufacturers acted earlier than they typically
have done to make one of their periodic adjustments in prices of
tobacco products--more than 5 percent before seasonal adjustment.
Because the PPI seasonal factors anticipated that those increases
would occur a bit later, the index, on a seasonally adjusted basis,
overstated the increase in May and likely will retrace part of that
increase in the next two months. The index for civilian aircraft
also registered a large increase, much of which, according to a BLS
analyst, actually occurred in earlier months. The PPI for each
month is revised four months later to take account of such
corrections and late reports.

PPI were, instead, largely the result of higher crude oil costs in
April. So far this month, spot prices of domestic crude oil have
averaged more than $22 per barrel--and posted prices about $21-1/2--
up about $1-1/2 from May and about $3-1/2 from their average level
during the first three months of this year. Private survey data for
early June point to a large increase in retail gasoline prices this
month as well as to further advances at the wholesale level.
The CPI for food fell 0.4 percent in May,.reflecting a
particularly steep decline in prices of fresh vegetables. As a
result, the index for fruits and vegetables has about retraced its
February-March runup. On average, prices of other foods continued
to post small increases. Concerns about weather in several growing
regions around the country have caused the prices of some crops to
become more volatile recently, but thus far these prices have not
broken out of the trading range seen earlier in the year.
The increase in the CPI excluding food and energy in May was
held down by a second month of small increases in rents. Increases
in several other service categories, notably entertainment, were
modest. Moreover, airfares declined about 3 percent. That decline
reflected the restructuring of airfares announced in April by the
major airlines: the deep discounts offered at the end of May
occurred too late in the month to be picked up last month and were
in effect for too short a time to have much influence on the June
index. By contrast, the CPI for nonfood, nonenergy commodities
was boosted in May, though much less than the PPI, by the increase
in cigarette prices.
8. Airfares were up in the April CPI, resulting in a net decline
of 2 percent over both months. In the CPI, airfares are sampled at
the time of purchase and are based on consumer rather than business
travel, thus limiting the impact on the index of the recent
developments.

At the producer level, price increases for finished goods
excluding food and energy generally remain modest (apart from the
anomalies indicated above), consistent with continued relatively low
capacity utilization in manufacturing. Prices of intermediate
materials excluding food and energy have edged up, on balance, since
late last year, and the PPI for crude nonfood materials less energy
rose in May for the fourth consecutive month (but has not yet
retraced its decline over the preceding year). These increases in
materials prices appear to mirror the modest improvement in
industrial demand.
Since mid-May, spot prices of industrial materials have
continued their upward drift. The Journal of Commerce index of
industrial prices rose about 1 percent over the six-week period, and
its metals component was about unchanged. Prices for tin, and to a
lesser extent, for copper, have moved up notably, but prices eased,
on net, for aluminum and steel scrap, in part reflecting slow summer
demand.
Background on the Rail Strike
At midnight on Tuesday, machinists struck CXS; the strike was
quickly followed by lockouts at 39 other freight railroads,
disrupting freight transportation throughout the United States. The
dispute involves rail unions that were not covered by the settlement
pattern imposed by the Congress last year on other railroad workers.
Many of the workers affected by the current negotiations are
maintenance workers employed by Amtrak or Conrail; these workers did
not walk off the job last night but are free to do so at any time.
In the past, railroad strikes have invariably been quite brief,
and the economic consequences minimal, because the Congress
typically has acted promptly to force the strikers back to work. We
expect this type of scenario to play out again in coming days. A

II-44
longer strike, however, could cause problems for producers that
either receive or ship output by rail. Many shippers have already
lined up alternative transportation in the trucking industry.
However, the available shipping from trucking--which already is
reportedly close to capacity--is by no means sufficient to make up
for a major rail strike.
Coal shipments are likely to be affected almost immediately by
the stoppage, but utilities (the big user of coal) report that they
have stockpiled enough to get through a short strike without
disruption. Chemical raw materials also typically are shipped by
rail, and a breakdown in the transportation network could quickly
affect production of a wide variety of products that use these
materials. In the automobile industry, heavy use of railroad
shipping and an increasing reliance on just-in-time inventories
leave motor vehicle production vulnerable to severe disruptions from
a protracted strike. However, this is the time of year when many
automobile plants are shut down for model changeover, and thus the
effects of a short strike are likely to be quite small. Ford, for
example, expects no major disruptions from a brief stoppage because
many of their plants will be idled anyway; GM appears somewhat more
concerned, and has indicated that half of their operations would be
affected within 24 hours of a strike. On balance, we think that a
short strike (4 days or less) would have only a small effect on
aggregate production. If the strike persists, however, the effects
on output could accumulate rapidly, especially in the industrial
sector.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most short-term interest rates are a shade higher now than they
were at the time of the May 19 FOMC meeting. Federal funds have
continued to trade around 3-3/4 percent, and the combination of
press reports about the Committee's directive, statements by
policymakers, and incoming news about the economy has on balance
lowered the perceived probability of another easing by the System.
Long-term bond yields are essentially unchanged, but mortgage
rates have eased a touch--possibly reflecting the slackening of
activity in that market after the first-quarter burst of
refinancings. The stock market appears to have suffered a bout of
acrophobia recently; since the Dow reached a new high of 3413 on
June 1, it has backed off nearly 3-1/2 percent as commentary has
focused on the possibility that second-quarter earnings reports will
bring some disappointments.
The broad monetary aggregates continue weak. M2 and M3 were
about flat in May, and data for early June suggest renewed declines.
Runoffs of time deposits--wholesale and retail--combined to drag
down the aggregates. M1 strengthened in May, likely reflecting an
unwinding of the earlier depressing effect of low tax payments; M1,
however, has flattened in June.
Debt growth in the domestic nonfederal sectors also appears to
have remained sluggish in May and early June. Gross public issuance
of bonds by nonfinancial corporations and state and local
governments has been heavy, mainly to refinance at lower rates
previously issued debt; companies also issued large volumes of
equities in May, as they further repaired balance sheets.
Households, too, have continued to exhibit a hesitancy to take on
debt, with a notable contraction in installment credit in April.

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The broad monetary aggregates have shown few signs of life
lately. After leveling out in May from April's runoff, the broader
aggregates appear to have turned down again in June. Smoothing
through the distortions induced by the flows of tax payments and
refunds, M2 growth likely will be at a virtual standstill in the
second quarter. This anemic performance, which has pulled M2 to
just below the lower bound of its annual growth range, is sharply at
odds with the predictions of standard money-demand models.
No new candidates are available to explain the weakness in M2
beyond those long suspected to have been at work. As far as can be
determined, three special factors continue to limit the growth of
this aggregate: the use of M2 assets to repay costly debt, the
pursuit of higher returns outside M2, and an unwillingness or
inability on the part of banks to compete aggressively for funds.
An important element explaining earlier weakness was absent in late
May and June, namely RTC activity; the resolution of additional
thrift institutions has been stalled by the failure of the Congress
to provide necessary funding.
The weakness in M2 over the past few months can be accounted
for arithmetically by a runoff in small time deposits, which have
contracted at a more than 20 percent annual rate so far this year.
These relative flows accord with the movements of deposit prices.
Rates on retail CDs remain well below comparable market rates,
particularly for longer-maturity deposits (chart). This widening
spread, along with the pronounced drop in market interest rates over
the last year, has meant that depositors rolling over maturing CDs
have been confronted with substantially lower rates. The extent of
this falloff in return has been particularly pronounced at one- and
two-year maturities (chart). For example, an investor rolling over

a two-year CD that matured in June would earn a deposit rate 3-1/2
percentage points below that earned on the original investment. In
such an environment, the advertised returns of stock and bond funds
may appear particularly attractive, despite the capital risk of
these funds. Indeed, capital market funds have posted brisk inflows
through much of the year.
M1 accelerated to a 14 percent rate of growth in May, up from a
5 percent pace in April, but this rapid growth was still somewhat
below its first-quarter rate of 16-1/2 percent. The pickup in M1
reflected a rebound in demand deposits and, more important, in other
checkable deposits (OCDs). Nonwithheld taxes (net of refunds) over
the past three months have come in well below the levels seen in
recent years. Consequently, OCD growth likely was depressed in
March and April--when households probably built up their balances
less than anticipated by the usual seasonal factors--and then was
boosted in May, when fewer tax checks were cleared. In June, M1
growth has dropped back, as demand deposits declined significantly,
partly because of a falloff in mortgage refinancing activity.
The strength in Ml in May showed through to M3, which was about
flat after contracting in March and April. This aggregate also
benefitted from some slowing in the erosion of large time deposits
and a slight pickup in the already brisk flow of funds into
institutional money market mutual funds. M3 may be weaker in June,
however, moving that aggregate further below the lower bound of its
annual growth range.
The low deposit interest rates appear to reflect the low level
of bank funding needs. Bank credit contracted at a 1 percent annual
rate in May, as the pace of security acquisitions by banks slowed.
Total loans contracted in May, with the weakness spread across all
major loan categories. Business loans declined at a 7-1/2 percent

rate, a bit faster than the pace seen in the early part of the year.
While banks reportedly have ceased tightening standards and terms on
business loans, there have been few signs that they are ready to
ease. Even though the federal funds rate has fallen 25 basis points
since early this year, interest rates on fixed-rate noncommitment
loans larger than $1 million had fallen through early May by only
10 basis points. Spreads of floating-rate commitment loans over the
federal funds rate also widened a bit. Real estate loans expanded
at a sluggish 1-1/2 percent rate again last month. The decline in
consumer loans accelerated somewhat in May at a time when a number
of banks were expressing more willingness to lend, as a pickup in
the pace of securitizations removed more loans from bank balance
sheets. Data for early June show few, if any, signs of a recovery
in lending.
Corporate Finance
The further declines in bank loans, combined with runoffs in
commercial paper outstandings in April and May and declines in
finance companies loans in April, indicate that aggregate demands
for business credit remain weak. Although gross public issuance of
new corporate securities continued at a strong pace in May and early
June, most of the proceeds again are going to refinance debt and
improve balance sheets.
A noteworthy share of public bond issuance has continued in the
speculative-grade sector as firms seek to refinance high-coupon debt
and as investors, including those returning to junk bond mutual
funds, reach for higher yields. Junk bond issuance has been $14.8
billion in 1992 through May, already surpassing the total issuance
in 1991 of $12.4 billion. In May, B-rated firms were again a
significant presence, accounting for more than half of the
speculative-grade bond offerings. Several firms issued reset notes,

which were a popular way to finance LBOs during the late 1980s. The
recent issuers of reset notes now seem mostly to be taking advantage
of the steep yield curve as the initial coupon is set relative to
short-term rates.
Yield spreads of investment-grade bonds relative to Treasuries
narrowed for most nonfinancial categories in May and early June. A
prominent exception was the major airlines, all of which were
downgraded recently by Standard and Poor's. The outlook for most of
the airline companies is negative as concerns have been raised about
continued price competition and sluggish business travel; recent oil
price increases are an added adversity.
Equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was strong in May at $5.6
billion, the second highest monthly total this year. Offerings
included General Motor's $2.1 billion of common stock and more than
$500 million by both Federated Department Stores and Marion Merrill
Dow. In the first three weeks of June, several large equity
offerings were marketed, including $560 million of PERCS by
Westinghouse, and issues by Browning-Ferris, Amerada Hess, General
Instruments, and USX-U.S. Steel. Moreover, many nonfinancial firms
have large equity offerings on the calendar. In contrast to strong
issuance by established companies, initial public offerings were
down by about one-third from April to May, in part because of
further declines in prices for biotech and healthcare stocks.
The major stock market indexes dropped more than 3 percent over
the intermeeting period, although the Dow Jones industrials touched
a record high on June 1. Most sectors experienced declines as
market participants lost hope of a System easing and saw the
prospects of a stronger OPEC cartel and higher oil prices
developing. In the past week, concern also emerged about the
possibility of disappointing earnings reports for the second

III-10
quarter. The S&P price-earnings ratio has edged down, but was still
a lofty 25 in mid-June.
Banks continued to issue equity at a fairly strong pace in May
and early June. Chemical Bank and First Chicago each raised more
than $300 million and First Interstate and Chase Manhattan completed
$150 million offerings. Banks also were active issuers of bonds in
May, raising nearly $2.5 billion as spreads over Treasuries narrowed
20 basis points. Offerings of bank notes surged, with Morgan
managing to raise funds at rates roughly equal to Treasuries.
Public issuance of asset-backed securities has risen sharply in
recent weeks. Offerings were boosted by GMAC's presence in the
auto-loan-backed sector, steady securitization of home equity lines
of credit, and Citicorp's global offering of credit-card-backed
securities in mid-June. Despite the increased supply of asset-
backed securities, spreads have narrowed to historical lows.
Life insurance companies experienced continued deterioration of
their commercial real estate assets in the first quarter of 1992.
Among all life insurers, commercial mortgage loan delinquencies in
the first quarter increased to 6.4 percent, from 5.9 percent at
year-end 1991, and commercial mortgage loans in process of
foreclosure rose to 3.2 percent, from 2.9 percent. Moody's recently
downgraded the claims-paying ability of Travelers from A2 to Baal
and that of New England Mutual from Aa3 to A1. citing significant
exposure to depressed commercial real estate. At year-end 1991,
15 percent of Travelers' mortgages were delinquent, and only
26 percent of its mortgage loans maturing in 1991 were repaid as
scheduled. Both companies are expected to suffer client withdrawals
and nonrenewals of group annuity business.

III-11
Treasury and Sponsored-Agency Financing
The federal deficit is projected to be $34 billion in the
second quarter. The Treasury is expected to finance the deficit and
build up its cash balance by issuing $53 billion of marketable
borrowing and $9 billion of nonmarketable borrowing, largely SLGS
(state and local government series) to municipalities. The
projected decrease in net marketable borrowing from the first-
quarter volume is more than accounted for by a $44 billion decline
in cash management bills outstanding. The Treasury did, however,
auction three short-dated cash management bills that matured within
the quarter to cover low points in the cash balance. The gross size
of weekly bill auctions was raised to $23.2 billion from $22.8
billion during the second quarter. Gross auction sizes of coupons
have been unchanged to up $250 million.
Agency spreads (over comparable Treasury rates) have been near
historical lows during the intermeeting period as the Federal Home
Loan Bank System has continued to shrink. In recent weeks, three of
the government sponsored enterprises--the FHLB System, the Federal
National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation--have sold new debt by awarding an entire issue to a
syndicate of one to three dealers, rather than to a large number of
sellers. Some of these recent issues have been structured as
callable step-up bonds. For example, FHLMC sold an issue with a
five-year maturity and a coupon of 5-3/4 percent that is callable at
par in two years. If the call is not exercised, the coupon is reset
to 7-5/8 percent for the remaining three years. This bond can be
thought of as a combination of two securities: a two-year bullet and
a put option owned by the issuer to put a three-year bond to the
investor in two years. These callable step-up bonds are part of

Municipal Securities
Gross offerings of long-term municipal bonds were a substantial
$14 billion in May and are expected to reach $17 billion in June.
With municipal bond yields near their lowest levels in thirteen
years, refunding volume has remained particularly heavy. For the
first five months of 1992, the average monthly volume of $5.3
billion of refunding issuance is near the record pace of 1986, when
interest rates and anticipated limits on pre-refunding spurred
issuance. Sales of short-term debt are expected to rise sharply in

notes in anticipation of revenue to be collected during fiscal year

with about $2.5 billion of short-term debt, and New York City, with
about $1.5 billion, are expected to be the largest issuers.

California issued $475 million of short-term obligations to

mature in July, when the state plans to issue $4 billion in notes if
the governor and legislature have reached agreement on a budget.1
State lawmakers have had difficulty in forming a budget because of
steady erosion of the state's fiscal position by continuing
shortfalls in tax receipts. The most recent projection of the
state's deficit for fiscal year 1993 has risen almost $4 billion, to
more than $10 billion. Market participants indicate that some
investors have backed away from the state's (AA-rated) debt, and
yields on its general obligation issues have risen from 5 basis
points below to more than 5 basis points above similarly rated
issues. The rating agencies also have expressed concern about the
state's financial condition and have indicated that downgradings are
possible.
Serious budget problems also face New Jersey. Standard &
Poor's recently warned that New Jersey's credit rating, currently
AA+, is in danger of a downgrading. The rating agency cited the
refusal by the federal government to pay about $450 million in
retroactive medicaid reimbursements to the state, thereby nearly
ensuring that the state will end the current fiscal year with a
deficit. S&P also noted a $600 million increase in the state's
projected budget shortfall for the next fiscal year, to
1. The failure to adopt the 1993 budget forced the state to issue
warrants rather than revenue anticipation notes. Without a budget,
the state cannot anticipate the revenue required to repay revenue
anticipation notes. The warrants are payable from unencumbered
monies in the general fund and could come from transfers from the
reserve fund, loans from other special funds, and proceeds from
revenue anticipation notes. The state appears to have the means to
redeem the warrants when they come due in July, even if a budget has
not been adopted. Nonetheless, to gain the highest credit rating on
the warrants, the state entered into standby agreements with Bank of
America and Guaranty Trust requiring them to bid for additional
warrants if funds are not sufficient to retire the original
warrants. When the state runs out of cash--probably by early July
if no budget is adopted--it would be forced to pay its bills with
scrip as well.

$1.3 billion, because of a 1 percentage point reduction in the sales
tax rate.
More than $10 billion of municipal debt likely will be redeemed
on July 1, retiring more than 1 percent of outstanding municipal
debt. Market observers estimate that this will be the single
largest redemption day in the history of the municipal market. The
pace of retirements thus far this year is dramatically faster than
that of the past several years and is likely to remain so throughout
1992, because of calls of bonds sold in 1982 at relatively high
yields and since refunded. Some analysts expect more than $30
billion in municipal issues to be called in 1992, about $10 billion
more than were called in 1991. These analysts expect calls to
continue at the 1992 pace through at least 1995.
Mortgage Markets
Available data suggest that total mortgage credit growth
probably has not picked up in the current quarter from the subdued
first-quarter pace. Mortgage debt outstanding grew at an estimated
3 percent annual rate in the first quarter, led by the single-family
category. Multifamily and farm mortgage debt increased at annual
rates of 1-3/4 and 3/4 percent, respectively, while commercial
mortgage debt contracted at roughly a 3 percent annual rate. Thus
far in the second quarter, growth of real estate loan at commercial
banks has averaged about 1-1/2 percent, seasonally adjusted, down
slightly from the first-quarter pace, while gross issuance of
mortgage pools has been running at a record pace. Meanwhile, the
Mortgage Bankers Association's purchase index, a measure of new
mortgage loan applications and an indicator of prospective mortgage
flows, has declined significantly from its level at the end of the
first quarter, although it has edged up in recent weeks (chart).
Refinancing activity at mortgage banking companies has declined more

than 16 percent since the first quarter, based on changes in the
MBA's refinancing index.
During the intermeeting period, contract rates on conventional
mortgage loans have declined about 16 basis points, on net, and are
now roughly equal to their average level in the first quarter--
though still 25 basis points above their January low. The initial
rate advantage of ARMs over fixed-rate mortgages remains nearly
2-3/4 percentage points, but according to the Federal Housing
Finance Board's monthly survey of major institutional lenders, ARMs
have accounted for only about 20 percent of conventional loan
originations through April. Data from the MBA's weekly survey,
which provide a more recent estimate, confirm a continuing low share
for ARMs among all mortgage loan applications at mortgage bankers.
Trade reports suggest that the most active segment of the ARM
secondary market has been the FHA ARM, which has 1 percent annual
and 5 percent lifetime interest rate caps. These risk-reducing
features are more popular with borrowers than the annual and
lifetime caps of 2 percent and 6 percent respectively, common with
conventional ARMs indexed to the one-year constant maturity Treasury
yield. Evidence supporting the reports of success by mortgage
bankers in promoting FHA ARMs is found in the increased volume of
GNMA ARM-backed securities. Issuance of GNMA ARM-backed pass-
throughs totaled a record $5 billion through the first five months
of 1992, about 17 percent of all GNMA securities issued during the
period. This volume exceeds the $3.5 billion in GNMA ARMs produced
in 1991 as a whole, and is well above the 1990 total of less than
$1 billion.
Gross issuance of federally related pass-through securities
continued at a record pace in April, reaching a seasonally adjusted
$44 billion (table). Preliminary data indicate that pass-through

III-18
issuance increased further in May, because of continued heavy
issuance by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Volume in both months
reflected the surge in mortgage applications in the first quarter
prompted by the large decline in rates. Industry data show that
intermediate-term mortgages continue to account for an increasing
share of agency pass-through issuance. In the mortgage derivative
market, REMIC issuance also strengthened in May. The aggressive
REMIC bid for pass-through collateral has continued to put upward
pressure on pass-through prices, keeping yield spreads over
Treasuries near historical lows.
A relatively new area of real estate loan securitization has
been given a boost by the Department of Veterans Affairs, as part of
an ongoing effort to trim its loan portfolio. The VA scheduled for
sale this month a $400 million pool of vendee home loans--loans made
by the agency to purchasers of properties acquired through
foreclosures on VA-guaranteed loans. For the first time, the VA

will guarantee timely payment of principal and interest on the
securities, giving investors the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government. Since 1988, the VA has securitized more than 83,000
vendee loans, with an aggregate principal value of about
$3.6 billion.
Delinquency rates on home mortgages declined rather sharply in
the first quarter, according to seasonally adjusted data from the
MBA. The thirty-day "all loan" delinquency rate dropped for the
third consecutive quarter to 4.52 percent, down 0.26 percentage
point from the previous quarter and only marginally above the low
point of the past decade, which was registered in the first quarter
of 1990 (chart). Delinquency rates on mortgages past due sixty days
or more, a measure of more serious payment problems, declined 0.08
percentage point, to 1.48 percent, also its lowest level since late
1990.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding declined in April at a
6-1/4 percent annual rate, its weakest performance for any month
during its downswing of the past year and a half. Automobile credit
fell at a 9 percent rate, contrasting with smaller declines over the
previous few months; revolving credit, with growth at a 3 percent
annual rate, continued the substantially weaker pattern that emerged
2for that component late last year.
Unlike past periods of economic recovery when consumer credit
has rebounded quickly and sharply, consumer credit outstanding has
declined during the current recovery. For most of the period, this

incorporating the results of a benchmark survey for finance
companies conducted every five years as well as data from the bank
Call Report and other sources. The revisions had little net effect
on growth in aggregate consumer credit, as less rapid growth in auto
credit over the past two years was largely offset by growth in
revolving credit that was faster than originally published.

pattern has been consistent with the unusually sluggish recovery in
outlays for consumer durable goods, particularly when account is
taken of some shifting by consumers to substitutes for installment
credit, such as auto leasing and home equity lines of credit. The
degree of weakness in consumer credit since the beginning of the
year, however, seems more pronounced than can be accounted for by
these factors alone. Households apparently have been paying off
existing debts more rapidly than has been customary; especially
large unscheduled paydowns of consumer loans in April were noted by
several banks in the consumer credit reporting panel. For some
time, the high level of the aggregate debt-to-income ratio has
suggested that households would need to reduce their payment
burdens. Measurable progress is being achieved in that regard as
consumer debt declines (chart, next page).
Downturns in several loan delinquency rate series further
suggest that households have experienced less financial stress
recently. The consumer loan delinquency rate on the bank Call
Report, covering both credit cards and all forms of closed-end
installment loans, dropped fairly sharply in the first quarter after
two smaller declines in the second half of last year (chart, left).
Delinquencies on auto loans at finance companies have followed a
similar pattern, declining since mid-1991, with a fairly substantial
first-quarter drop.
Meanwhile, interest rates charged on new loans have been
dropping, making new debt more affordable. Rates on new-car loans
at banks fell in May to an average level of 9-1/2 percent, their
lowest reading since the series was begun in 1972. Conventional
measures of credit card rates have remained quite sticky; however,
there has been more rate competition among card issuers in recent
months than reflected in the Board series or other published series.

In particular, card issuers have been segmenting their markets more
than in the past, offering lower rates to selected classes of their
customers. The Board series reflects only the "most common" rate
charged, which is usually the highest rate. Within the past six to
nine months, First Chicago, Citibank, and other big issuers have
been offering reduced rates to customers with good payment records
and relatively high volumes of purchases. Also, although some
issuers have always offered relatively low regular rates, aggressive
pricing in recent months on the part of the variable-rate AT&T card
has stepped up the intensity of rate competition.

Merchandise Trade
In April, the preliminary U.S. merchandise trade deficit
widened to $7.0 billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis) from a
revised $5.6 billion in March. Nonagricultural exports fell by $1
billion in April, mostly attributable to a decline in exports of
aircraft. Non-oil imports increased only marginally in April,
following a strong increase in March, as a modest decline in imports
of consumer goods was more than offset by an increase in imports of
capital goods. An increase in both the price and quantity of
imported oil accounted for most of the April $0.7 billion gain in
total imports.

imports increased for the fourth consecutive quarter. A drop in
shipments to developing countries brought about the decline in
nonagricultural exports. These exports to developing countries,
particularly of capital goods, had registered an increase for seven
consecutive quarters, although the rate of increase had been slowing
since the second quarter of 1991.
Imports of capital goods excluding aircraft increased in the
first quarter, the third consecutive quarter of increase. Imports
of consumer goods fell in the first quarter after large increases in
the third and fourth quarters of 1991. In recent years movements in
imports of consumer goods have been similar to movements in non-auto
inventories (since 1987 the simple correlation coefficient between
the change in these two series is 0.42). The large increases in
imports of consumer goods during the second half of last year were
matched by large increases in non-auto retail trade inventories. In
the first quarter of 1992, although retail trade inventories did not
fall, they rose at a much slower rate than in the previous two
quarters.
Strong OPEC production and mild weather pushed oil import
prices down sharply in the first quarter. OPEC production
restraint, especially on the part of Saudi Arabia, began to push
spot prices up in March, with import prices responding in April.

stable oil prices. Oil prices retreated in recent weeks, until the
the latest round of talks between the United Nations and Iraq
concluded. Spot WTI currently stands just below $23.00 per barrel.
Given these movements in spot prices, import prices will likely rise
at least through July, to roughly $19.50 per barrel.
A small rise in oil consumption, coupled with the first
building of petroleum stocks in five months, pushed the quantity of
oil imports up in April. Imports in the first quarter had been
restrained by mild weather and seasonally typical stockdraws.
Preliminary Department of Energy data suggest that imports in May
will fall slightly from the April rate.
Prices of Exports and Non-oil Imports
Prices of U.S. exports fell 0.2 percent in April, the result of
declines in prices of exports of wheat, corn, and soybeans. Prices
of nonagricultural exports rose 0.2 percent in April. For the first
quarter, nonagricultural export prices fell at an annual rate of 1.1
percent, led by declines in prices of exports of industrial supplies
and materials (mainly fuels and agricultural materials). Prices of
exports of consumer goods rose at an annual rate of 5.9 percent in
the first quarter.
Prices of non-oil imports fell 0.7 percent in April, the second
consecutive month of decline. The largest declines were registered
in the foods, feeds, and beverages category. For the first quarter,
prices of non-oil imports rose at an annual rate of 4.5 percent.

Aside from the volatile foods, feeds, and beverages category, the
largest increases in the first quarter were for prices of imports of
consumer goods, especially recreational equipment and durable
household goods. The more recent monthly declines in prices of
non-oil imports may reflect a lagged adjustment to the rise in the
exchange value of the dollar during the first quarter of this year.
U.S. Current Account. The U.S. current account balance
recorded a deficit of $5.3 billion in the first quarter of 1992,
compared with $7.2 billion deficit (revised) in the fourth quarter
of 1991. A narrowing of the merchandise trade deficit and increases
in surpluses from service transactions and investment income were
partly offset by an increased outflow of unilateral transfers.
As of the latest Bureau of Economic Analysis press release,
data on the U.S. current account now incorporate new source data,
improved methodologies, and changes in definitions. The revisions
introduced were significant; the current account deficit for 1991
was narrowed by $4.9 billion. Data on the U.S. current account for
the last five quarters are shown in the table on the next page; the
amount of the revision for each of the items is shown in the
memorandum line at the bottom of the table. The revisions did not
reverse the direction of quarter-to-quarter changes during 1991 for
any of the series shown in the table, with the exception of the
change in net services from the third to the fourth quarter.
The recent revisions to the data on services and investment
income were extensive, but were only highlighted in the press
release. Data on services transactions now make use of Mexican
source data for travel receipts and payments and incorporate
revisions to Canadian data on travel receipts and payments.
Canadian, United Kingdom, and Federal Reserve data have been
substituted for Treasury data on U.S. nonbanks deposits abroad,

IV-7
raising estimated interest income. Investment payments and receipts
are now reported gross of nonresident withholding taxes with an
offset to these taxes now recorded under unilateral transfers. Data
on dividend receipts are now calculated by applying an estimated
yield to the stock of equity holdings. Additionally, returns on
holdings of foreign currency are more precisely estimated. For all
accounts, aggregate figures for earlier years and supporting detail
for current and earlier years will be available July 2.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Substantial net capital inflows were recorded for April.
Official reserve assets in the United States climbed by $3.7
billion, largely as the result of increases in holdings by Spain,
Taiwan, and Mexico. (See line 4 of the Summary of U.S.

Net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities by private foreigners
were also strong in April, amounting to $5 billion (line 3). Almost
two-thirds of the total net purchases were accounted for by Bermuda
(the location of a number of investment funds that are active in
trading U.S. Treasury securities); substantial net purchases were
also recorded for the United Kingdom and Japan. In addition,
private foreigners purchased more than $4 billion net of U.S.
corporate and government agency bonds (line 2a). On the other hand,
foreigners continued to make net sales of U.S. corporate stocks
(line 2b). Net purchases of foreign stocks and bonds by U.S.
residents amounted to almost $4 billion (line 2c), largely from
Europe.
More recent data suggest that both U.S. purchases of foreign
bonds and foreign purchases of U.S. corporate bonds remained strong
in May. In particular, new Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations
were substantial in May and foreign bond issues in the United States
reached near record levels. In addition to the usual large number
of Canadian borrowers, medium-term note issues by several German
banks were noteworthy.
Net bank-reported flows in April were small (line 1). There
were substantial net outflows from financial institutions in April
resulting from RP transactions with Bermuda and the United Kingdom,
probably helping to finance the large net purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities recorded for these countries. Countering these outflows
were substantial net inflows into banks from related foreign
offices.
U.S. residents have sharply reduced their holdings of
Eurodollar deposits since March, largely at the Caribbean branches
of U.S. banks. (See line 3 of the International Banking Data
Table.) In contrast, according to the FRBNY survey, foreign

commercial paper outstanding in the United States increased sharply
in April, by more than $5 billion.
Data recently released by the Department of Commerce on U.S.
capital flows in the first quarter of 1992 are shown in lines 6
through 10 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions Table
(page IV-8). U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6) remained very
strong, largely as the result of intercompany debt flows to
affiliates in Canada and the United Kingdom. Foreign direct
investment inflows (line 7) declined to virtually zero, reflecting
the slowdown in merger and acquisition activity and poor profits
resulting in negative reinvested earnings.
The large inflow in the first quarter recorded for other
capital flows (line 8) consisted largely of net inflows into banks
as the result of changes in foreign-currency denominated claims and
liabilities (particularly changes in positions of the U.S. offices
of Japanese banks vis-a-vis Japan) and a decline in banks' custody
claims on foreigners (largely holdings of negotiable and readily
transferable instruments). The statistical discrepancy in the
international accounts (line 10) swung to negative $16 billion.
Revised data for 1991 were also recently released by the
Department of Commerce. (Revised data for earlier years will not be
available until July 2.) In some cases the changes were
substantial; new data sources, improved methodologies, and changes
in definitions along with revisions in reported data accounted for
these changes. The revisions were particularly large for U.S.
nonbanks claims on foreigners (included in line 8) because of the
substitution of Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and Bank of Canada
data on bank deposits for data collected in the Treasury
International Capital (TIC) Reports. There was also a substantial
downward revision to foreign direct investment in the United States

IV-12
(line 7); part of this revision was the result of changes in
definitions, but the bulk was the result of amended reports which
indicated that capital inflows previously reported in 1991 had
actually occurred in 1990.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign-exchange value of the dollar, in
terms of the other G-10 currencies, has declined about 2 percent on
balance since the May 19 FOMC meeting, as shown in the accompanying
chart. The dollar rose through the first week of the intermeeting
period amid positive U.S. economic data but has declined since late
May, on somewhat weaker than expected U.S. economic indicators and a
larger than expected U.S. trade deficit. The dollar has moved
nearly 2 percent lower versus the Japanese yen, with most of that
decline occurring at the end of May; Japanese authorities encouraged
the yen's appreciation through intervention sales of dollars on
several occasions, but the overall effect of these operations
appears to have been limited.
The defeat of the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty on
June 2 threw into doubt plans for European union and economic
convergence. The mark, regarded as the most stable European
currency, was seen as benefitting from uncertainty over the future
of European monetary union. The dollar has lost more than 3-1/4
percent against the mark since the Danish vote, for a net decline of
about 2-1/4 percent versus the German currency since the last FOMC
meeting. Other European currencies were hurt by the uncertain
future of the Maastricht treaty, though a small part of the effect
of the Danish vote apparently was reversed by the victory of the
Irish referendum on June 18. The Spanish peseta has declined about
1 percent on net against the mark, while sterling and the Italian
lira have each lost about 1/2 percent against the mark. The lira

also has been weakened by the delay in naming an Italian prime
minister.
Long-term interest rates have changed little on net in the
United States, Germany, and Japan since the last FOMC meeting.
Three-month interest rates in the United States have backed up
slightly while German three-month rates have eased 10 basis points
and Japanese rates have eased more than 20 basis points in
anticipation of a small easing in Japanese monetary policy.
Following the Danish vote, long-term bond yields have risen about
1/4 percentage point in France. Italy, and the United Kingdom and
more than 1/2 percentage point in Spain.
Japanese stock prices, as measured by the Nikkei index, have
declined more than 15 percent since the last FOMC meeting (about
11-1/2 percent according to the broader Topix index), with the
government delaying in formulating its plans for a supplemental
budget package and with the Bank of Japan seen as reluctant to ease
monetary policy significantly despite signs of persistent weakness
in the Japanese economy. Over the intermeeting period, stock prices
have declined nearly 7 percent in the United Kingdom, most of that
since the Danish vote, but German stock prices have moved only
slightly lower.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Output growth picked up in several foreign industrial countries
in early 1992, but in Canada the pace of recovery remained modest,

IV-15
and in the United Kingdom, the recession continued at least through
the first quarter. In Germany and Japan, output rose 7.3 and 4.3
percent (s.a.a.r.), respectively, during the first quarter of 1992,
following declines in the previous quarter. In both countries the
first-quarter turnaround was exaggerated by special factors; in
Japan, industrial production actually fell during the first quarter.
Monthly indicators for the second quarter point to moderate growth
in most countries.
Inflation remains elevated in Germany, but has declined further
in Canada and has remained fairly stable in the other countries.
Wage pressures continue in Germany, but a recent series of strikes
was settled without a dramatic worsening of these pressures.
On June 2, voters in Denmark unexpectedly rejected the
Maastricht Treaty in a nationwide referendum. The rejection
encouraged opponents of the move toward greater European unity, but
at present, most political leaders in Europe are determined to move
ahead with ratification. On June 18, voters in Ireland endorsed the
treaty by a wide margin. On June 24, the French Senate and National
Assembly ratified the Treaty in a joint vote.
Individual country notes. In Japan, real GNP increased 4.3
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, after a 0.3 percent decline
in the fourth quarter. Domestic demand rose at a 3.6 percent annual
rate in the first quarter, due mainly to a 3.4 percent rise in
consumption that was possibly boosted by the extra business day
because of leap year. Plant and equipment investment declined for
the second consecutive quarter (down 0.2 percent), and residential
investment declined for the sixth consecutive quarter (down 0.4
percent). Inventories made a 0.9 percent positive contribution to
growth, mainly reflecting changes in government rice holdings. The
external sector made a 0.8 percent positive contribution to growth

which was entirely attributable to an increase in net factor income.
Companies reportedly increased their repatriation of profits from
overseas affiliates ahead of the end-of the business accounting year
in March in order to make up for poor domestic earnings. Excluding
special factors, first-quarter GNP growth was probably only about
1-1/2 percent at an annual rate.
Indicators of activity so far in the second quarter have been
generally negative. Industrial production (s.a.) increased only 0.1
percent in April, and this increase followed six consecutive monthly
declines that lowered the index by a cumulative total of 5.9
percent. The inventory to shipments ratio (s.a.) was up a further
0.7 percent in May, raising its 12-month increase to 10.6 percent.
Retail sales at large stores (n.s.a.) showed a 12-month decline of
0.2 percent in April. New machinery orders (s.a.) fell 12.5 percent
in April, more than reversing their first-quarter increase of 3
percent. New passenger car registrations (s.a.) dropped 10.1
percent in May, and were 14.9 percent lower than a year earlier.
The number of bankruptcies (s.a.) was up 7.9 percent in May, raising
their 12-month increase to 33.5 percent. The unemployment rate
(s.a.) eased to 2 percent in April. However, the job offers to
applicants ratio (s.a.) declined a further 4.1 percent in May, to a
level 19.9 percent below a year earlier. The strongest indicator
continued to be housing starts (s.a.), which increased 1.7 percent
in April after a 7.5 percent rise in the first quarter. Housing
starts showed a 12-month increase for the first time since October
1990.
Inflationary pressures have remained moderate. Consumer prices
in the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) were up only 0.1 percent in May and their
12-month increase declined to 2.4 percent. Through the first five
months of the year, consumer prices, seasonally adjusted and

IV-20
excluding perishable food items, increased at a 2.6 percent annual
rate. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) declined 0.1 percent in May and
were 1.4 percent below their year-earlier level. Overall wholesale
prices have been held down by declining import prices, which in May
were 6.3 percent below their year-earlier level.
The trade surplus (s.a.) increased further in May. Through the
first five months of the year, the trade surplus was $106.9 billion
(a.r.), up from a $70.1 billion surplus in the same period last
year. Over this period, export volume (s.a.) was up 3.5 percent
while import volume increased only 0.4 percent.
Real GNP in western Germany increased 7.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
the first quarter due primarily to special factors. Growth was
boosted by the elimination of calendar effects (unusually large
leave-taking around the mid-week Christmas and New Year holidays)
that depressed output in the fourth quarter. In addition, mild
winter weather contributed to a surge in seasonally-adjusted
construction activity.
West German industrial production (s.a.) increased 0.3 percent
in April after falling 1.8 percent in March. April's modest
increase follows a period of sharp monthly swings--December through
March--caused by special factors. For the first quarter as a whole
industrial production increased 2.8 percent, but comparing the level
of industrial production in March and April with that in October and
November suggests that there has been only modest growth in
underlying economic activity since the fourth quarter.
The volume of new orders for west German manufactured goods
(s.a.) fell sharply in both March and April after increasing earlier
in the year. Domestic orders (including orders from eastern
Germany) fell 3.9 percent and 0.8 percent in March and April,
respectively, after increasing 4.7 percent and 0.7 percent in

IV-21
January and,February. Foreign orders were down 4 percent in April
after increasing steadily between November and March.
In spite of the declines in output in the second half of 1991,
little slack has emerged in west German labor markets. The west
German unemployment rate (s.a.) increased 0.1 percentage points in
each of the last three months and stood at 6.5 percent in May.
However, employment has continued to increase, in part because of
labor agreements that mandate reductions in weekly hours.
Industrial production in eastern Germany (n.s.a.) rose 12
percent in March, while new orders for east German manufactured
goods jumped 9 percent.
Consumer price inflation in western Germany has remained strong
in recent months. Consumer prices (n.s.a.) increased 0.3 percent in
May, after increases of 0.4 percent and 0.3 percent in March and
April. Over the three months to May consumer prices (s.a.)
increased at an annual rate of 4 percent, compared with 2.5 percent
for the three-month period ending in February.
Negotiations over wage agreements for 1992 are essentially
complete. In the engineering sector an agreement was reached giving
workers a 5.8 percent increase in wages and one-time payments for
the period April 1992 through March 1993. The agreement also calls
for a 3.4 percent wage increase for the remaining 9 months of 1993.
The extension of the contract for the rest of 1993 was not expected
and was generally viewed as a positive development.
After improving in February and March, the pan-German current
account deficit (n.s.a.) widened from $0.2 billion in March to $1.4
billion in April. Merchandise exports (s.a.) fell 5 percent in
April, while imports (s.a.) increased slightly.
Through May, M3 (s.a.) in western and eastern Germany had
increased at an annual rate of 9 percent in 1992, relative to the

IV-22
fourth quarter of 1991, up slightly from a revised 8.9 percent
increase in April. May's figure is well above the Bundesbank's
target range of 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent growth for 1992. Demand on
the asset side of the banking system remains strong due to strong
investment in both parts of Germany and declines in internally
generated funds within the corporate sector. In addition, the
supply of funds to the banking sector has shifted towards shorter
maturities in response to Germany's inverted yield curve. German
banks appear to be competing more actively for deposits in
anticipation of increased competition from non-German banks once the
EC internal market project is fully implemented.
On June 18 the lower house of the German Parliament gave final
approval to the government's plan to restructure the Bundesbank.
The number of Land Central Banks--roughly equivalent to our Federal
Reserve District Banks--will be reduced from 11 to 9 and their
regions will be expanded to include the five new east German states.
In addition, the maximum size of the Bundesbank Directorate--roughly
equivalent to the Board of Governors--will be reduced from 10 to 8.
These changes will take effect unless one of the German states
challenges the legislation in Germany's constitutional court. Such
a challenge is not expected.
In France, real marketable GDP, a preliminary indicator of
total GDP that excludes most government services, grew 4.5 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter largely because of very strong
export growth. Consumption growth was moderate at 2.8 percent,
while investment declined slightly. In April, industrial production
rose 1.5 percent (s.a) from its March level while manufacturing
production, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.4 percent.
Industrial production rose only slightly in the first quarter
because unusually warm weather caused a sharp drop in energy output.

IV-23
The unemployment rate rose to 10 percent (s.a.) in April from 9.9
percent in March.
Consumer prices in May were 3.1 percent above their year-
earlier level, the same change as in the previous month. Hourly
wages in April were 1.3 percent (n.s.a.) above their level in the
January survey, and stood 4.5 percent above their year-earlier
level. France registered a cumulative trade surplus of $3.2 billion
(s.a.) in the first five months of 1992, compared with a deficit of
$3.5 billion in the same months of the previous year.
Following the Danish rejection of the Maastricht Treaty
President Mitterrand announced that a referendum on the Treaty would
be held in France, probably in September. The Senate and National
Assembly ratified the Treaty by the necessary three-fifths majority
in a joint vote on June 23. A referendum is not required by the
constitution. Commentary in France suggests that the referendum was
called to exploit divisions over the treaty between the two
mainstream parties on the right, headed by Jacques Chirac and
Giscard d'Estaing.
In Italy, the economy appears to be growing slowly. Fourth-
quarter GDP rose 1.2 percent (s.a.a.r.). up from only 0.8 percent in
the previous quarter. Industrial production (s.a.) rose 2.5 percent
in the first quarter but was weak in April, falling 5.7 percent.
Auto sales were up 4.8 percent in the first five months of 1992 from
the same period a year earlier, but all of the gain went to imports;
sales by Italian manufacturers fell 2 percent.
Inflation has picked up recently, following a sharp decline
earlier in the year. The 12-month rise in consumer prices (n.s.a.)
was 5.6 percent in May, up from 5.5 percent in March and April, and
5.3 percent in February. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) in April were

IV-24
3 percent above a year earlier, compared with a 1.6 percent rise in
March.
The cumulative trade deficit during the first four months of
1992 was $9.3 billion (s.a.a.r.), up modestly from $8.5 billion in
the same period in 1991. The current account deficit widened
substantially during 1991, reaching $21.5 billion, compared with a
deficit of $14.2 billion during 1990.
Political paralysis continues to stymie policy initiatives.
Since the general election of early April, a caretaker government
has been in office while Italian politicians have wrangled over the
composition of a new government. Giuliano Amato, a leader of the
Socialist Party who authored bank reform legislation in 1990 that
bears his name, has been designated to try to form a new coalition.
Recent monthly data suggest that economic recovery is finally
underway in the United Kingdom, but it seems to be less buoyant than
previous recoveries. The recession continued in the first quarter,
with real GDP falling 1.8 percent (s.a.a.r.). The post-election
rebound in consumer spending appears to be weaker than expected.
The volume of retail sales (s.a.) rose 0.8 percent in April and 0.3
percent in May, reversing a pre-election decline. The average level
for the two months was 0.4 percent above the first-quarter average.
Unemployment (s.a.) rose in May to a rate of 9.6 percent, up from
9.5 percent in April. Total industrial production (s.a.) rose 0.7
percent in April after declining 0.7 percent the previous month.
Manufacturing production was up for the third month in a row.
Construction orders (s.a.) rose 3 percent in the first quarter and
were up 4 percent from the same period last year.
Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent (n.s.a.) in May. The 12-month
rise remained at 4.3 percent. Excluding mortgage interest rates,
consumer prices rose 0.3 percent and stood 5.3 percent above their

IV-25
May 1991 level. Producers' output prices edged up 0.1 percent in
May, to a level 3.6 percent above a year earlier.
In May, the trade deficit narrowed somewhat, but the cumulative
current account deficit for the first five months of 1992 was $16.9
billion (s.a.a.r.), compared with a deficit of $6.8 billion in the
last five months of 1991. The deterioration in the current account
position since the beginning of this year has given rise to worries
that increased import spending will slow down the recovery.
In Canada, first-quarter GDP growth (s.a.a.r.) was 1.7 percent.
Largely because of a 0.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) decline in consumption
and a sharp decrease in inventories, total domestic demand fell 3.9
percent. However, the external sector made a large positive
contribution to growth, as exports surged 15 percent and imports
fell 3 percent.
Available second-quarter data suggest that the economy is
continuing to recover. Retail sales (s.a.) increased 0.8 percent in
April. Although the unemployment rate rose from 11.0 percent (s.a.)
in April to 11.2 percent in May, total employment (s.a.) rose 0.3
percent, its first increase since last October. Factory shipments
(s.a.) rose 1.1 percent in April, and new orders (s.a.) were up 1.4
percent. However, May housing starts (s.a.) slipped 2.4 percent.
Recent price data show continued success for the Bank of
Canada's efforts to reduce base inflation. The CPI excluding food
and energy (n.s.a.) rose 0.2 percent in May, lowering the 12-month
rise from 2.2 percent in April to 2 percent in May. The 12-month
rise in the all-items CPI was only 1.3 percent in May. Wholesale
prices (n.s.a.) fell 0.3 percent in April, and stood 1.1 percent
lower than a year earlier. First-quarter wage settlements increased
2.9 percent (a.r.), compared with a 3.6 percent average for all of
1991.

IV-26
Canada's current account deficit (s.a.a.r.) narrowed $5.5
billion in the first quarter to $23.8 billion, as merchandise
exports rose sharply. In April, the merchandise trade surplus fell
slightly to $6.7 billion (s.a.a.r.), down from $7 billion in March.
Recently, there has been substantial uncertainty about Canada's
political future due to a lack of consensus in discussions of the
National Unity Plan constitutional reform proposals announced by the
federal government last September. The Cabinet plans to submit
specific constitutional amendments to Parliament by the end of June,
the result of discussions in which the English-speaking provinces
took part. The provincial government of Quebec has promised to hold
a referendum on the proposals by the end of October. Recent
statements by Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa hint that rejection of
the proposals by Quebec voters would not necessarily lead to the
province's secession.
Developments in East European Countries
Recent political developments in Eastern Europe have increased
uncertainty on the future course of economic policy in the region.
The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic appears to be headed for a
break-up, following a Slovak nationalist victory in elections held
earlier this month for the Slovak parliament. Some press reports
indicate that an interim federal government to negotiate a smooth
breakup will be established for a minimum term of one and a half
years. More recent reports, however, suggest that the split could
occur as early as this fall, before annual budgets have to be
prepared. This development raises concerns over the future of the
Czech and Slovak regional economies, although no immediate changes
in economic policy have resulted. Reports indicate that potential
foreign investors are delaying investment decisions in light of this
political uncertainty.

IV-27
In Poland, following the confirmation of Peasant Party (PSL)
chairman Waldemar Pawlak as Prime Minister, the lower house of
Parliament passed the 1992 budget, which restricts the fiscal
deficit to $4.79 billion. This figure is equivalent to 5 percent of
projected GDP and represents a slight decline from last year.
Passage of the budget was necessary to continue discussions with the
IMF concerning a proposed 20-month standby arrangement. In the
IMF's view, this budget is consistent with non-accelerating
inflation, and the Fund management has shown a willingness to
endorse the program, provided that Poland keeps to its budget. At
this time Pawlak has not established whether his economic program
will continue the anti-inflationary policies of his predecessor Jan
Olszewski, or will favor the program consistently proposed by his
Polish Peasant Party of subsidies and protection for agriculture.
On June 1, Russia signed the Articles of Agreements of the IMF,
making it a full member of the Fund. It appears that a Fund
arrangement is unlikely to be put in place before September.
Perceived backsliding of the Russian reform program, delays in
producing fiscal projections, and lack of agreement on monetary
arrangements among the republics of the former Soviet Union have
hampered conclusion of a stand-by arrangement. President Yeltsin
has appointed four new ministers with the intent of bringing
"industrial technocrats" into his government, while elevating First
Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar to Acting Prime Minister. Yeltsin has
continued to emphasize his commitment to the reform program.
In mid-May, the government agreed to raise but still retain
control over oil and gas prices for industrial consumers. Yeltsin
has reportedly said that energy prices will not be freed before
year end.

IV-28
The budget deficit in the first quarter of the year was
reportedly about 8 percent of GDP. The government is under
increasing pressure to increase wages in various sectors, to bail
out faltering industrial enterprises, to grant tax exemptions, and
to provide more for a social safety net.
The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) maintained a tight credit
policy early in the year, but this was relaxed considerably by the
end of the first quarter. Non-Russian central banks in the various
former republics have continued to extend credit at a rapid rate.
At the end of May, the CBR raised its lending rate to 80 percent, up
from the previous rate of 50 percent. Inter-enterprise debts have
been building up, reflecting the belief that the government will
eventually finance the debt. The situation at the CBR remains
unsettled after Chairman Matyukhin submitted his resignation, but
both the government and the Parliament refused to accept it.
Although exchange rates are scheduled to be unified and allowed
to float on July 1, this now appears unlikely because of the delays
associated with the IMF program and the absence of necessary steps
to implement the change in the exchange rate regime.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Mexico, economic growth appears to be less robust than
earlier expected. Since mid-April, capital inflows have tended to
slow, the peso has weakened somewhat against the dollar, and
interest rates have risen further. Argentine industrial production
was sharply higher in the first quarter than a year earlier, while
year-over-year inflation continues to fall. In May, the government
announced plans to reform Argentina's inefficient port system.
Economic activity remains strong in Korea and Taiwan and sluggish in
Brazil and the Philippines. Brazil missed the first-quarter fiscal
performance criteria of its IMF stand-by arrangement and is likely

IV-29
to miss the second-quarter criteria. Negotiations with foreign
commercial banks are moving slowly. Korea's trade deficit is
narrowing, while Taiwan's trade surplus is growing. In May, the
Philippines completed a debt buyback from commercial banks.
Individual Country Notes. In Mexico, economic growth appears
to be less robust than earlier expected. The chemical, steel, food,
and transportation equipment industries had lower sales in the first
quarter than in the same period of 1991. The official first-quarter
GDP was 4.2 percent higher than a year earlier, but this rate is not
adjusted for the higher number of working days in March 1992, when
there were no holidays, than in March 1991, when Holy Week slowed
production. Most observers expect that 1992 growth will be close to
the 1991 rate of 3.6 percent, rather than significantly higher as
previously believed. The official forecast of 1992 growth has now
been lowered to 3 percent from the 4 percent estimate put forward in
President Salinas' budget message last November.
Despite slower growth, first-quarter imports were 28 percent
higher than a year earlier, after a 23 percent increase in 1991 as a
whole. Capital goods and consumer goods imports rose by 42 and 22
percent, respectively, after rising by 24 and 11 percent in 1991 as
a whole. In contrast, total first-quarter exports were only 2
percent higher than a year earlier. Manufactured goods exports were
17 percent higher, but flood damage and other natural causes lowered
agricultural exports by 24 percent, and lower prices caused a 13
percent fall in oil exports and a 40 percent fall in mineral
exports. As a result, the first-quarter trade deficit was $3
billion, up from $0.9 billion in the same period of 1991.
The twenty-eight-day Treasury bill rate rose further in May and
early June, and was 14.6 percent at the June 17 auction, up from
13.3 percent at the May 6 auction. Since mid-April, capital inflows

IV-30
from abroad have tended to slow, as some banks repaid part of their
external borrowings to conform with new Bank of Mexico restrictions.
This put pressure on the floating exchange rate. At the same time,
firms have begun to make payments into the newly created pension
system, further squeezing liquidity. The authorities have partially
countered this trend by repurchasing ten-year bonds from commercial
banks, but they have accepted higher interest rates to stimulate
capital inflows and as a means of restraining economic activity and
slowing inflation. Achieving single-digit twelve-month inflation
rates by early 1993 is a priority government objective. The
government is confident that this is possible and has announced
plans to drop three zeros from the currency on January 1, 1993. The
CPI rose by 0.7 percent in May when it was 16.3 percent above May
1991. Most observers expect twelve-month inflation of about 12
percent by December.
Since June 1, uncertainty generated by weakness of the exchange
rate has been reinforced by delays in completing the North American
Free Trade Agreement negotiations, and by a rumor, later denied,
that the telephone workers union, which is engaged in difficult
negotiations with the telephone company, was about to sell its large
stake in the company. These factors combined to depress the Mexican
stock market, which closed on June 23 about 15 percent below the
June 1 peak. Market losses were especially large for the telephone
company, which is widely held abroad. Several new stock issues
scheduled to be offered in international markets in coming days will
now raise less than had been expected.
If the stock market sell-off leads to a further slowing of
capital inflows, the short-run impact on international reserves may
be substantial. Reserves, excluding gold, were about $18 billion at
the end of January, when they were last published, but capital

IV-31
inflows are said to have been large in February-early March. Given
the unsettled situation since mid-April, reserves now are probably
only slightly higher than $18 billion.
In Argentina, preliminary data indicate that industrial
production in the first quarter of 1992 was 22.8 percent above its
year-earlier level; consumer durables experienced the strongest
growth. Monthly consumer price inflation dropped to 0.7 percent in
May from 1.3 percent in April. Year-over-year inflation declined to
22.4 percent in May, its lowest rate since the 1970s. Despite
continued inflation, the nominal exchange rate has remained fixed
against the dollar since March 1991. As a consequence, the real
exchange rate has appreciated substantially over the past year.
To reduce export costs and help maintain export competitiveness,
and to lower the domestic prices of imports and thereby help to
restrain inflation, the government announced in late May plans to
deregulate and restructure Argentina's inefficient port system. The
plans include the privatization of many port functions, elimination
of restrictive regulations adding to operating costs, and
renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements.
The IMF mission that visited Argentina in May confirmed that
Argentina met its 1992 first-quarter performance criteria under the
IMF Extended Fund Facility approved in March. On June 23, agreement
was reached on a term sheet for the Brady Plan commercial bank debt
restructuring agreed in principle on April 7.
In Brazil, statistical information available through March and
anecdotal evidence on more recent developments indicate that
economic activity remains sluggish. Real GDP was 5.8 percent higher
in the first quarter than in the extremely depressed first quarter
of 1991, largely because of sizeable increases in agricultural
output and in agricultural exports. On a seasonally adjusted annual

IV-32
rate basis, real GDP was 2.9 percent higher in the first quarter
than in the fourth quarter of 1991. The lack of a credible fiscal
adjustment program and tight monetary policies have led to very high
real domestic interest rates, dampening domestic demand.
The cumulative trade surplus through May was $6.2 billion,
unchanged from the same period of 1991. Inflation remains
persistently high, in the range of 20-25 percent per month.
Brazil missed its first-quarter fiscal performance criteria
under the IMF stand-by arrangement approved last January and is
unlikely to meet the second-quarter criteria. Very high real
interest rates, which greatly increase the government's cost of
servicing its domestic debt, have exacerbated the fiscal problem.
Lack of action on the fiscal front prompted IMF Managing Director
Camdessus to make an appeal for political support for fiscal changes
while attending the Environmental Conference in Rio in mid-June.
The government continues to face challenges to its proposals
for fiscal reform. Its proposal to restructure the inefficient port
system was rejected by port workers who went on strike in early
June. Recent accusations of corruption against President Collor's
top advisors are further undermining the government's political and
popular support. They have led to a congressional inquiry into
Collor's role in these dealings and calls for his impeachment. His
approval rating has dropped precipitously. Partly in response to
these political developments, the stock markets have fallen on the
order of 27 percent since mid-June. The price of Brazil's external
debt paper in secondary markets was 32.6 percent of face value on
June 23, down from 39.6 percent on June 4.
Negotiations with commercial banks have moved slowly since the
last Greenbook. Disagreement persists over how much Brazil will
provide to collateralize the par and discount bonds, over the terms

IV-33
of the par bonds, and over whether to place a limit on the amount of
debt that might be tendered for these bonds. Given the slow pace of
fiscal reform, Brazil may be unable to obtain sufficient funds for
the collateral from outside sources to supplement what it might
provide from its own reserves. According to the Brazilian press,
the government is considering increasing interest payments to banks
from 30 percent of interest due to 50 percent.
Korea's GDP rose 7.5 percent in the first quarter of 1992 from
a year earlier, compared with an increase of 9.1 percent over the
previous four quarters. Inflation has slowed somewhat this year;
consumer prices were 7.3 percent higher in May than a year earlier,
down from 8.7 percent in the year ending May 1991. In the first 4
months of 1992, due to a pickup in exports, the current account
deficit fell to $3.5 billion from $4.9 billion in the same period of
1991, and the trade deficit fell to $2.7 billion from $4.4 billion
in the same period of 1991.
In Taiwan, GDP rose a preliminary 7 percent in the first
quarter of 1992 from a year earlier after a rise of 6.2 percent in
the first quarter of 1991 from the same period in 1990. Price
developments are mixed; in May, consumer prices were up 6.1 percent
from a year earlier, compared with a 2.6 percent increase in the
year ending May 1991, while wholesale prices fell 3.5 percent
compared with an increase of 1.8 percent a year earlier. Taiwan's
trade surplus in the first 5 months of 1992 expanded to $4.9 billion
from $3.6 billion in the same period of 1991, as export growth
picked up largely due to booming trade with China. The current
account surplus was $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 1992, about
the same as in the first quarter of 1991.
In the Philippines, GDP was 0.5 percent higher in the first
quarter of 1992 than in the same period of 1991. This was the first

IV-34
year-over-year quarterly increase after five quarterly decreases.
Prices rose 5.2 percent in the year ending April 1992, compared with
8.7 percent in the year ending in March mostly due to spending
linked to the May 11 presidential election. Former Defense
Secretary Fidel Ramos, who won the election, has pledged to continue
the economic policies of President Aquino. In May, the Philippines
completed a debt buyback from commercial banks that retired almost
$1.3 billion in face value, nearly all at a discount of 48 percent.
