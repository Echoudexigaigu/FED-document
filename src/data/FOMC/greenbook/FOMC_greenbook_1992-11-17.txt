Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Indications of the pace of economic activity in the current
quarter are in short supply at this point; what information there
is, however, suggests at least a mildly positive trajectory.
Private payrolls increased slightly in October, and the same appears
true for industrial output. Despite declining consumer sentiment,
motor vehicle sales were up last month, and largely anecdotal
information on other retail activity is moderately upbeat. Rising
orders for nondefense capital goods through September point to a
solid gain in shipments this quarter, and the increase in housing
starts during the summer augurs well for residential construction
activity. Meanwhile, with the amount of slack in the economy still
substantial, increases in wages and prices continued to slow.
Real GDP
According to BEA's advance estimate, real GDP increased at a
2-3/4 percent annual rate in the third quarter. This was somewhat
faster than most market observers had anticipated. However, an
examination of the details of the report and the subsequent incoming
data do not reveal any obvious grounds for the suspicions expressed
by some that the growth rate was vastly overstated. The estimated
rise in final sales--2.1 percent at an annual rate--seems broadly
consistent with the monthly indicators available at this time.
BEA's assumption for the September merchandise trade deficit was in
line with the already-sizable August figure. Incoming data on
manufacturing and wholesale trade inventories also have been in line
with BEA's advance estimate of a modest increase in nonfarm
inventory investment. The increase in farm inventory investment is
not directly verifiable, but it is consistent with the latest data
on agricultural production this year.

Employment and Unemployment
Recent data point to a slight improvement in labor demand.
Private payroll employment rose 66,000 in October after remaining
about unchanged in September. The average workweek and the index of
aggregate hours for private production workers partially reversed
their sharp September declines, and the civilian unemployment rate
edged down to 7.4 percent.
Nonfarm payroll employment was up 27,000 in October; the number
was held down by losses in government employment that reflected
early retirements by postal workers and the end of the federally
funded summer jobs program. In the private sector, the services
industry added 89,000 jobs last month, with business services, which
tend to be cyclically sensitive, and health services providing most
of the increase. Finance, insurance, and real estate added 14,000
jobs, and wholesale trade posted its first increase in more than two
years. By contrast, manufacturing employment fell another 56,000
last month. Although declines were widespread by industry,
transportation equipment was particularly hard hit by cutbacks in
defense spending. However, total hours in manufacturing were flat,
as an increase in overtime offset the employment decline. Also,
construction posted a modest gain of 20,000 in October, in part
reflecting rebuilding activity in the wake of Hurricane Andrew.
In the household survey, employment fell 76,000 in October.
However, the number of persons unemployed declined 238,000, and the
jobless rate edged down 0.1 percentage point. In general, the
household measure of employment has changed little from month to
month over the past six months, and the runup in the unemployment
rate through June, as well as its subsequent decline, primarily
1. The BLS estimates that there were about 45,000 retirements
from the Postal Service and about 20,000 exits from the summer jobs
program in October.

reflects large swings in the labor force. After rising sharply last
winter and spring, the labor force participation rate has declined
about a half percentage point since June (chart). Such a decline is
very unusual during a recovery.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance have come in
noticeably under the 400,000 mark of late. These numbers are
somewhat deceptive, however; under revisions to the Emergency
Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program made in July, some workers
are eligible to file for EUC benefits who otherwise would have filed
for regular benefits. As shown in the table below, after adjusting
regular initial claims for an estimate of this phenomenon, claims
recently have been running around 400,000--a level that historically
has been consistent with only small gains in payrolls.

Other labor market indicators point to continued sluggishness
in the demand for workers. The Conference Board's index of help-
wanted advertising fell back again in September and is scarcely
above its cyclical low. Perceived employment prospects, as measured
by the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey, remained poor
in October: The fraction of respondents believing that jobs are
plentiful has barely improved in recent months. A monthly survey of
smaller businesses by the National Federation of Independent

Business suggests that hiring plans picked up a little over the
course of-this year but remain weak: In September, only about
6 percent more firms (seasonally adjusted) planned to expand
employment than planned to reduce employment during the next three
to six months; this figure had been around 10 percent prior to the
recession. Other employer surveys are similarly downbeat on hiring
expectations.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose at a
2.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, reflecting a
3.0 percent rise in output and only a small increase in hours. This
pattern--rising output and weak hours--has been evident throughout
the recovery. Over the past six quarters of rising output, total
hours worked have fallen somewhat, while productivity has increased
at an average annual rate of 2-1/2 percent.
Industrial Production
On balance, activity in the industrial sector has shown little
change since May, although the available data suggest that
production edged up in October. Last month, physical production
measures advanced slightly on net: Sizable gains in output of light
trucks, raw steel, and refined petroleum products more than
compensated for declines in output of electricity, appliances,
paper, and paperboard. As noted earlier, total hours worked by
manufacturing production-workers were unchanged in October, and,
with productivity likely advancing further, factory production
probably rose a little.
Two years after the onset of the recession, total industrial
production remains about 1-1/2 percent below its peak of the third
quarter of 1990. Excluding computers, production is more than
2-1/2 percent below its peak; only output of nondurable consumer
goods and of related materials has surpassed pre-recession levels,

appears likely that some of the step-up in assembly rates scheduled
for the remainder of the quarter will be realized.
Personal Income and Consumption
Growth in real income remains exceptionally weak for a
business-cycle upswing. Real disposable personal income was flat in
the third quarter, and, even adjusting for the effects of Hurricanes
Andrew and Iniki, it increased at only a 0.5 percent annual
2rate. Since the trough in disposable income in the first
quarter of 1991, real DPI has risen at a 1.7 percent annual rate,
compared with a 4.5 percent average in other recoveries (chart, top
panel).3 The shortfall is concentrated in real wages and
salaries (chart, bottom panel). Judging from the October labor
market report, labor income likely rose early in the fourth quarter.
Although real personal consumption expenditures increased at a
3-1/2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, that increase was
based largely on gains in June and July. Real PCE was flat in
4August and edged up just 0.1 percent in September. The
2. Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki affected several components of
nominal personal income in both August and September. Most
prominently, destruction of uninsured property was counted as a
reduction in rental income. Other large effects were a reduction in
farm proprietors' income due to crop damage and to the destruction
of property, and reduced wages and salaries for employees unable to
work in the aftermath of the storms. The latest estimates of
Hurricane Andrew's effects on personal income are smaller than the
initial estimates, because BEA now believes that more of the losses
were insured than originally thought. The initial estimate was that
Hurricane Andrew reduced rental income of persons and proprietors by
about $46 billion; the current estimate is a reduction of $22.6
billion. It should be noted that, although the hurricane effect on
personal income was reduced, the larger insurance company payouts
likely will show up as lower estimates of corporate profits for the
third quarter. BEA's estimates of hurricane effects on other
components of the national income accounts were little changed.
3. The average is calculated from the recoveries that began in
1961:Q1, 1970:Q4, 1975:Q4, and 1982:Q4.
4. BEA did not make specific adjustments to account for the
impact of Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki on real PCE; some of the
effects are, of course, already embedded in the underlying source
data (predominately retail sales information). However, nominal
personal consumption expenditures were reduced because BEA subtracts
insurance payouts from insurance premiums to generate its estimate

September gain reflected a substantial increase in purchases of
durable goods, such as furniture and household equipment, that may
have been influenced by rebuilding efforts following Hurricane
Andrew. In addition, sales of new motor vehicles were up a bit in
September, and unseasonable weather boosted electricity consumption.
These increases were largely offset by a decline in spending on
nondurable goods, leaving total consumer spending near its July
level (chart). Coincident with this stagnation in consumption, the
Michigan and Conference Board indexes of consumer sentiment have
drifted lower since July.
One area of improvement since July has been sales of light
motor vehicles. The latest data show substantial increases in sales
for September and again in October. Seasonal adjustment problems
(associated with the extensive incentive programs on light trucks at
the end of the 1991 model year) may have misallocated some sales
between September and October; nevertheless, the average
13.1 million unit annual rate for the two months together was
considerably above the July-August pace. Most of the gains
reflected a strengthening in the market for light trucks; sales of
cars remained sluggish. The relative gains in the truck market
reflect further growth in the sales of minivans and lower-priced
pickups. Part of the stagnation in sales of North America-produced
autos since July may be attributed to reductions in fleet sales to
car rental companies.
The personal saving rate moved down to 4.5 percent in the third
quarter--4.6 percent excluding identified hurricane effects.
(Footnote continued from previous page)
of nominal spending on insurance. Real PCE on insurance is
estimated using a different method, which does not directly capture
hurricane effects. As a result, the discrepancy between the two
measures is forced into the deflator for insurance services.

Despite this drop, the underlying trend of the personal saving rate
(as measured by a four-quarter moving average) has been upward since
around the beginning of 1990 (chart).
Housing Markets
Housing market indicators have continued to be mixed but, on
balance, now provide fairly persuasive evidence of a moderate pickup
in demand and production since midyear. Housing starts, which rose
substantially in August, edged up further in September to
1.26 million units at an annual rate, the highest reading since
March (table and chart). Permit issuance rebounded in September
after little change in August. Rebuilding in the wake of Hurricane
Andrew did not have a discernible effect on national or regional
estimates of starts and permits in September.5
Single-family starts inched up to an annual rate of
1.07 million units in September, their second-highest level this
year. Single-family permits increased more rapidly than starts in
September, narrowing the gap between the two series, which was
unusually wide in August (chart, top panel). The closer alignment
of the two indicators suggests that greater confidence can be placed
in the starts estimate.6 Also, the preliminary estimate of new
home sales for September (lower panel, dashed line) edged down only
a little from the August figure, which was revised upward
substantially (solid line). Large upward revisions in new home
sales have occurred with regularity this year; the dot on the chart
5. The Census Bureau has made a special effort to identify
construction activity that reflects rebuilding following Hurricane
Andrew. Beginning with the September release, Census changed its
definitions of starts and permits to include units being totally
rebuilt on an existing foundation.
6. Because the permits series is less subject to sampling error
than starts, high readings of starts relative to permits can be an
indication of irregularities affecting the starts estimate.

indicates the level to which a typical revision would raise the
September preliminary estimate.
The demand for single-family housing has been pulled in two
different directions by the flattening of house prices in recent
years (chart, upper panel). Slowing price increases have
contributed to a decline in the cash-flow burden of a mortgage,
which has helped support housing demand. However, the weakness of
house prices also has diminished the amount of price appreciation
that buyers probably expect, thereby damping the demand for
homeownership as an investment.
On the supply side of the housing market, the outstanding
inventory of new homes for sale continued to decline in the third
quarter, to the lowest level in about nine years (chart, lower
panel). Moreover, when measured relative to sales as months'
supply, the stock of homes for sale is near the low end of its
historical range. Although this may signal an emerging tightness in
the market, the flatness of prices suggests that, so far, the supply
of homes for sale has been adequate in relation to demand.
Multifamily housing starts edged up to 185,000 units (annual
rate) in September but continued to be impeded by a persistent
oversupply of rental apartments and the resulting restraint on
rents. In the third quarter, the vacancy rate for multifamily
rental properties edged down to 9.3 percent--only a little below the
9.6 percent reading in the year-earlier period.
7. The Census Bureau samples newly issued building permits and
then obtains information about sales of the newly permitted units.
Although an imputation is made for houses that are sold before a
permit is issued, an underestimate occurs if the number of such
units is unusually large, as has occurred repeatedly this year.
From the preliminary estimate to the final estimate, the average
revision for the first half of this year was about 32,000 units.

Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for producers' durable equipment posted another
strong increase in the third quarter, led, once again, by a sharp
increase in outlays for computing equipment. Recent data on orders
and shipments at domestic manufacturers point to a softening in the
computer industry, but, at the same time, suggest that other areas
8are picking up. Real outlays for nonresidential structures,
which had changed little over the first half of 1992, declined
sharply in the third quarter.
Outlays for computing equipment have risen at close to a 40
percent annual rate during the past year and a half, accounting for
almost all the increase in producers' durable equipment spending
during this period. According to industry sources and articles in
trade publications, investment in computers has been driven by
further price reductions and product innovations.10 However, the
nominal value of shipments of computing equipment declined fairly
sharply in both August and September, and new orders have fallen, on
net, during the past few months (chart). The data in hand point to
further growth in real outlays for computing equipment in the
current quarter, but at a slower pace than earlier in the year.
8. September data on shipments of nondefense capital goods
suggest a small upward revision to third-quarter PDE. Outlays for
computing equipment are expected to be revised down nearly $2
billion (1987 dollars), while outlays for PDE excluding aircraft,
motor vehicles, and computers are expected to be revised up about
$2-3/4 billion.
9. Data on construction put-in-place, which became available
after the advance GDP report, suggest an upward revision to outlays
for nonresidential structures of close to $2 billion (1987 dollars).
Even with this revision, these outlays still would show a decline of
about $5 billion in the third quarter.
10. It should be noted that the surge in business spending for
computing equipment since early 1991 has been accompanied by a
dramatic deterioration in the trade balance for computers and parts.
During this period, constant-dollar imports, which constitute about
half of business purchases of computing equipment, jumped more than
80 percent, while exports rose 33 percent; as a result, the trade
balance in this sector declined from a surplus of $2-1/2 billion to
a deficit of $14-1/2 billion (1987 dollars).

Spending on transportation equipment declined significantly
last quarter, owing largely to another sharp swing in aircraft
purchases. Purchases of new aircraft jumped to an unsustainably
high level in the second quarter and then dropped back to a
relatively low level in the third quarter. These outlays may
rebound in the current quarter but are likely to trend down during
the next couple of years owing to the overcapacity among domestic
carriers.
Investment in items other than transportation and computing
equipment advanced at an annual rate of 11-1/2 percent in the third
quarter, and a large, widespread increase in orders points to
further gains in coming months. Purchases of communications
equipment accounted for most of the increase in spending in the last
quarter. Part of this strength probably stems from a movement among
telephone companies toward digital technologies and fiber optics.
In addition, purchases of cellular phones, fax machines, and modems
have been trending upward for some time.
Outlays for nonresidential structures, which had fluctuated
within a fairly narrow range earlier this year, dropped sharply last
quarter. Among sectors, office construction posted the largest
decline in the third quarter; the annual rate of decline in this
sector over the first three quarters of this year was about the same
as in 1991. Activity in the industrial and "other commercial"
sectors also dropped considerably in the third quarter, and growth
in institutional construction slowed.
For the nonresidential construction sector as a whole, new
commitments (the sum of contracts and permits for this sector) have
flattened out this year, after sharp declines in 1990 and 1991.
However, construction, which usually lags new commitments by about
half a year, has continued to trend down this year, albeit not as

sharply as in 1991. The office sector, where the lag between new
commitments and construction is relatively long, continues to be the
weakest component of nonresidential structures. Moreover, office
vacancy rates around the country generally remain very high,
especially in downtown areas, and prices for office properties have
continued to decline. All told, a further shrinkage of activity in
this market segment is likely for at least the next few quarters.
The picture in the industrial sector is similar, though less
severe. Currently, there is plenty of spare capacity in the
industrial sector. New commitments currently are running well below
the level of construction, suggesting that activity will remain
weak, at least in the near term. In contrast, new commitments and
construction appear to be fairly well aligned in the other
commercial and institutional sectors. The "other commercial" sector
shrank substantially in 1991 but has flattened out, on net, this
year. The prospects for this sector depend critically on the future
course of the retail sector of the economy.
Finally, drilling activity, which sagged earlier this year,
increased in October to a level of 753 rigs in use, up 10 percent
from the previous month. Much of this pickup is attributable to the
recovery from damage caused by Hurricane Andrew and higher prices
for natural gas.
Business Inventories
The available data indicate that businesses in manufacturing
and trade may have trimmed their stocks in September, after sharp
accumulations in July and August, and there appear to be no serious
inventory overhangs at this time.
In manufacturing, inventories were reduced in September at an
annual rate of $12 billion in current-cost terms, retracing a

substantial portion of the runup in August.ll The August
accumulation of manufacturing stocks apparently was the result of a
sharp drop in shipments. (Factory production edged down in August,
even after adjusting for the effect of Hurricane Andrew and a strike
at General Motors.) As shipments rose in September, factory stocks
were drawn down, and inventory-shipments ratios for most industries
returned to the low end of their recent ranges. Although a
substantial part of the September drawdown was in defense aircraft,
liquidation was widespread in other durable goods industries as
well. By stage of processing, manufacturers apparently have
continued to carefully manage their holdings of production materials
and work-in-process, over which they have more direct control, and
inventory-shipments ratios trended downward (chart, middle and lower
panels). For finished goods, however, the inventory-shipments ratio
generally has remained flat in recent months, around the level that
prevailed during the one and one-half years before the 1990-91 sales
slump (chart, upper panel).
In wholesale trade, inventories changed little in September,
after moderate accumulations in July and August. For the third
quarter as a whole, inventories of merchant wholesalers rose at a
$3 billion annual rate in current-cost terms--about what BEA assumed
in its advance GDP estimate--while sales rose 3.3 percent (not
annualized). The inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale trade
sector fell to 1.32 months at the end of September, the low end of
the range posted over the past year.
11. In constructing the advance GDP estimate for the third
quarter, BEA assumed that manufacturing inventories declined in
September at an annual rate of $8.1 billion in current-cost terms--
about $4 billion less liquidation than indicated by the incoming
data. Given BEA's estimates of IVAs and implicit inventory
deflators, the discrepancy may lead to a downward revision to third-
quarter nonfarm inventory investment of about $1 billion in real
terms.

Non-auto retail inventories fell back in August, reversing a
portion of the sharp increase in July. The August liquidation was
largely in stocks of nondurable goods--apparel, food, and general
merchandise--where stocks have been broadly in line with sales. For
stores in the GAF grouping, inventory buildups averaged a moderate
$7-1/2 billion (current cost) annual rate over the first two months
of the third quarter and left the inventory-sales ratio for GAF
stores at 2.37 months in August, considerably below its recent peak
of 2.51 months in December of last year. Given the sizable
1.1 percent rise in GAF sales in September (and a 3.6 percent growth
over the third quarter as a whole) shown in the latest advance
retail sales report, inventories held by stores in this important
category probably are in reasonably good shape at present.
Federal Sector
The unified budget showed a deficit of $290 billion in FY1992--
about $20 billion larger than in FY1991 but considerably smaller
than had been anticipated only a few months ago. OMB projected a
deficit of $334 billion in July, and CBO's August estimate was
$314 billion. Outlays for deposit insurance turned out to be lower
than had been anticipated by either agency, largely because of fewer
resolutions of troubled banks by the Bank Insurance Fund. OMB also
overestimated spending in several other areas, notably defense and
health, and was much too pessimistic about receipts. Excluding
deposit insurance and contributions to the Defense Cooperation
Account, the deficit increased from $247 billion in FY1991 to
$292 billion in FY1992.
Receipts grew 3.5 percent in FY1992. The rise in taxes lagged
the 4.2 percent gain in nominal GDP over this period, largely
because of the change in withholding rules that lowered withheld
individual income taxes by about $2 billion per month beginning in

March. Most recently, however, estimated personal income tax
payments--nonwithheld income taxes and self-employment
contributions--were 20 percent higher in the third quarter than a
year earlier. The increase appears to reflect both greater
liabilities and changes in tax laws that require taxpayers to meet a
greater percentage of their liabilities through estimated payments.
Outlays increased 4.4 percent in FY1992: excluding deposit
insurance and the Defense Cooperation Account, the rise in outlays
was 6.4 percent. Most of the increase was in the Medicare, health,
and income security functions. In contrast, defense spending
decreased 4.3 percent, despite a third-quarter bulge associated with
a bunching of weapons deliveries, higher spending for operations and
maintenance, and severance allowances related to the downsizing of
the military.
Higher defense outlays also were evident in the advance NIPA
estimates for the third quarter, where defense purchases rose at
nearly a 7 percent annual rate in real terms after five quarters of
sizable declines. Meanwhile, nondefense purchases fell at a
1.4 percent annual pace, mainly because of decreased purchases of
structures and "other" items.
The appropriations bills passed by the Congress and signed by
President Bush hold total discretionary outlays for FY1993 nearly
$10 billion below the discretionary spending caps set by the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act; almost all the difference is in defense
spending, which is slated to fall 5 percent below its level in
FY1992. However, some of the restraint is anticipated to be offset
by about $7 billion of emergency outlays, not subject to the
spending caps, to compensate victims of hurricane damage. Lastly,
President Bush has vetoed the tax and urban aid bill.

State and Local Governments
According to BEA's advance estimate, real purchases of goods
and services by state and local governments edged up at a
0.4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, buoyed by an infusion
of federal funding for summer jobs. Outlays for structures were
unchanged, as increases for highways, hospitals, and school
buildings were offset by decreases for other types of structures.
And purchases of other goods and services fell, reflecting a sizable
rise in government charges for providing medical and educational
12services.
Meanwhile, receipts appear to have increased only a little in
the third quarter, as a modest rise in tax collections was largely
offset by a drop in federal aid. The decline in grants was the
first in two years and owed in part to a small drop in grants for
Medicaid, AFDC, and other public assistance programs; the decline
undoubtedly is temporary, given the sharp uptrend in spending under
these programs. All told, the deficit of operating and capital
accounts, excluding social insurance funds, is estimated by the
staff to have jumped to well over $50 billion, at an annual rate, in
the third quarter (chart).
Although budgets remain under pressure, governments have been
averse to another round of tax increases. Indeed, tax hikes during
state legislative sessions completed in 1992 are expected to result
in just a $4 billion increase in collections, compared with
$15 billion and $10 billion in increases during the 1991 and 1990
sessions respectively. Instead, governments have focused on
spending cuts, especially for higher education and local government
aid (other than for elementary and secondary schools). For example,
California's recent budget agreement reduced aid to counties,
12. To avoid double counting, such charges are treated as negative
outlays in the National Income and Product Accounts.

cities, and special districts by more than $1 billion. It also
reduced aid to the two university systems around 10 percent, and aid
to community colleges about 25 percent. Several other states,
including Ohio and Louisiana, cut spending on higher education as
well. Many states have raised tuition and fees, with increases
ranging from 13 to 60 percent.
Labor Costs
Continuing weakness in the labor market and moderating
inflation have led to further slowing of compensation cost
increases. The Employment Cost Index (ECI) for hourly compensation
for private industry workers increased 3.2 percent (annual rate)
over the three months ended in September. Over the twelve months
ended in September, ECI hourly compensation rose 3.4 percent--more
than a percentage point below the pace of the preceding twelve
months. This substantial deceleration was evident both in the wages
and salaries and in the benefits components of the ECI. At
2.7 percent, the twelve-month rise in wages and salaries was the
lowest reading since the survey began in the mid-1970s. The
deceleration in benefits costs reflects, in part, continued slowing
in the rate of increase of health-care expenses.
The deceleration of the past two years has been especially
great in the state and local sector, likely reflecting the fiscal
pressures on those governments. Compensation per hour of state and
local workers rose 3.5 percent over the past twelve months, about
the same increase as in private industry. Through 1990,
compensation gains for state and local workers had been outpacing
gains in private industry by more than one percentage point.
Within the private sector, the deceleration in hourly
compensation has been greater in the service-producing sector than
in the goods-producing sector. In part, this reflects an especially

low reading for the finance, insurance, and real estate industry:
Compensation per hour in that industry has increased only about
1-1/4 percent over the past twelve months. However, the ECI for
finance, insurance, and real estate is extremely volatile,
reflecting the inclusion of commissions and bonuses in the data, and
the recent small increases in compensation costs in that industry
may not persist.
The deceleration also has been widespread by occupation, but
has been especially rapid among service workers. For these workers,
compensation was up 3.5 percent over the twelve months ended
September, down 2 percentage points from the preceding twelve-month
period. The deceleration has been smallest--although still
notable--among blue-collar workers. This slower deceleration may
reflect the heavier unionization among blue-collar workers.
According to the ECI, the increase in compensation costs for
unionized workers was about unchanged over the past twelve months
and actually picked up over the past two years. Wages and salaries
for unionized workers, however, have shown a small amount of
deceleration over this period.
Separate data on new major collective bargaining agreements
also show a small deceleration in union wages. The series on
effective wage change in agreements covering 1,000 or more workers
rose 3.2 percent for the year ended in September, about
1/4 percentage point below the increases recorded in 1990 and 1991.
This measure of wage change--which includes the effects of first-
year adjustments from new settlements and the deferred adjustments
and COLAs under prior settlements--is conceptually similar to the
ECI for wages and salaries. The contributions of first-year
adjustments and COLAs have slowed this year relative to 1991, but
deferred adjustments under earlier contracts have not.

The only direct piece of statistical information available on
fourth-quarter labor costs is average hourly earnings for production
or nonsupervisory workers, which rose 0.2 percent in October.
Average hourly earnings are volatile on a month-to-month basis, but
smoothing through the monthly wiggles, they have shown a slowing in
response to labor market slack. Over the twelve months ended in
October, average hourly earnings were up 2.6 percent, about
1/4 percentage point less than over the preceding twelve-month
period.

Recent news on producer and consumer prices has continued to be
very favorable. The PPI for finished goods rose 0.1 percent in
October. The index for goods other than food and energy declined
0.1 percent, largely reflecting a sharp decline in seasonally
adjusted prices of passenger cars. Over the past twelve months, the
PPI excluding food and energy has increased 2 percent, about
1-1/4 percentage points less than in the preceding year.
In September--for the fifth consecutive month--the CPI for
items other than food and energy rose just 0.2 percent. With these
modest increases, the twelve-month change in this measure has fallen
rapidly, to 3-1/4 percent in September, down about 1-1/4 percentage
points from a year earlier (table). This is the smallest increase

in this measure since 1966, except for the period of wage-price
controls in the early 1970s. During the twelve months ending in
September, prices of goods other than food and energy have risen
just 2-1/2 percent, about 1-3/4 percentage points less than the pace
in the preceding twelve-month period. Prices of nonenergy services
have decelerated markedly as well, especially for airfares, tenants'
rents, and auto finance charges. Even the price of medical services
has decelerated over the past two years.
This deceleration in the CPI for items other than food and
energy reflects, in large part, the substantial slack in product and
labor markets. Unemployment has remained at a high level, putting
downward pressure on labor costs in both the goods- and service-
producing sectors (table). Low levels of capacity utilization in
manufacturing also have restrained price increases. Furthermore,
non-oil import prices have remained subdued, although these prices
did accelerate a bit in the past twelve months.
Overall, consumer prices were up just 0.2 percent in September,
as food prices increased further while energy prices were unchanged
(table). The increase in food prices reflected a continued rebound
in fresh fruit and vegetable prices, which retraced their April-July
declines during August and September. Despite the pickup in fruits
and vegetables, food prices are up just 1-3/4 percent over the past
twelve months. Given ample harvests, there appears to be little
upward pressure in train on food prices in coming months.
Consumer energy prices were unchanged in September and have
risen 2-1/4 percent over the past twelve months. In September,
gasoline prices declined, continuing to reverse a runup earlier in
the summer. However, private survey data for October and early
November show that retail gasoline prices were up somewhat on a

seasonally adjusted basis. 13 The index for residential natural
gas rose for a fourth consecutive month; it now stands 4-1/2 percent
above its May level. Wellhead prices began moving up during the
summer after the long-lived supply bubble was finally worked off.
More recently, hurricane damage to the Gulf Coast and expectations
of a cold winter have boosted spot prices, suggesting that--aside
from monthly volatility--additional advances in residential gas
prices are in store. As of November 9, spot prices were about
25 percent higher than before Hurricane Andrew.
For goods other than food and energy, prices at retail rose
just 0.2 percent in September. Goods prices were held down by
further declines in prices of house furnishings and personal care
goods; prices of these items continued to drop back, after posting
sizable increases early in the year. Prices of services other than
energy were up just 0.1 percent in September, as shelter prices were
unchanged.
Prices of capital goods also have remained subdued, as excess
capacity and weak demand held back price increases. In the past
year, the PPI for capital goods was held down by computer prices
that dropped 16 percent during the twelve months ending in October.
However, price increases for other capital goods have also been
restrained over this period, rising just 2-1/2 percent, about
1 percentage point below the year-earlier pace. Modest price
increases for motor vehicles over the past twelve months contributed
importantly to this slowing. For the October index, BLS fully

air rules requiring that only oxygenated fuels be sold in thirty-
nine metropolitan areas with high emissions of carbon monoxide.
Industry analysts estimate that refiners' costs have risen three to
five cents per gallon. However, the effect on the CPI likely will
be less because areas with oxygenated gasoline account for only one-
third of the CPI sample.

incorporated the 1993 model-year vehicles into the PPI sample.14
On a quality-adjusted basis, passenger car prices actually fell
1/2 percent in the twelve months ending in October, as, in addition
to modest sticker price increases, automakers began to discount the
new models immediately. Although light truck prices moved up
4-1/4 percent in the year ending in October, this still was a
1-1/4 percentage point slowdown from the year-earlier pace.
Spot measures of industrial commodity prices have fallen, on
balance, since the last Greenbook (table and chart). The Journal of
Commerce index of industrials has declined about 2-1/2 percent from
the end of September, retracing nearly half its increase since the
beginning of the year; its metals subindex has fallen 6 percent
since the time of the last Greenbook. These declines are consistent
with the recent sluggishness in industrial production--both here and
abroad. Finally, spot prices of crude oil have moved down more than
a dollar over this period (chart).

vehicles into the CPI gradually, fully incorporating them by
January.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have risen appreciably over the intermeeting
period. The failure of the System to validate market expectations
of an easing step after the last FOMC meeting prompted interest
rates in all maturities to increase 15 to 20 basis points. As
political developments raised concerns about possible expansion of
the federal deficit and incoming data suggested continued moderate
growth of the economy, intermediate- and long-term rates rose
further, bringing the total increase over the period to 25 to
90 basis points. Revised expectations on the economy also helped
buoy the equity market: Major stock price indexes have risen
between 2 percent and 5 percent since the last FOMC meeting.
Spreads between private and Treasury yields widened a touch
over the period, partly because of heavy issuance of corporate and
municipal securities. Those sectors of the market suffered as well
from reduced flows of cash into bond mutual funds and sales of
securities by insurance companies to fund hurricane claims. The
market for municipal securities rallied somewhat in November as
issuance slackened and a greater focus on the possibility of tax
increases may have spurred buying.
The evidence on credit flows remains mixed. Business loans,
which had strengthened in September, leveled off in October, and,
after accounting for special factors, commercial paper outstanding
was also flat. Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations
edged up in October, and public bond issuance remained strong; the
proceeds of these offerings were targeted primarily for debt
repayment. In the household sector, refinancing activity has
continued to dominate mortgage transactions, but borrowing for home
purchase reportedly has risen somewhat; installment credit recorded
a small increase in September, the first since January. State and

local governments have issued a large volume of tax-exempt bonds,
both to refund old debt and to raise new capital. Federal
borrowing, induced by the persistent deficit, has remained large.
Monetary growth strengthened further in October. Ml, propelled
by mortgage refinancing activity and the effects of low short-term
interest rates, grew at a 22 percent annual rate. This strength
bolstered M2, which increased at about a 5 percent pace. The non-M1
component of M2 fell slightly, as redemptions of small time deposits
more than offset large inflows into retail money market mutual
funds. M3 was about flat.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The expansion of M2 quickened to a 5 percent annual rate in
October after two months at about 3 percent. With this growth, M2
in October edged closer to, but remained below, the lower bound of
its target range. None of the strength in M2 showed through to M3,
which was about unchanged in October, falling further below the
lower bound of its target range.
The growth rate of M1 increased to 22 percent in October,
mainly reflecting lagged adjustment to reductions in interest rates
resulting from previous monetary easings. In addition, special
factors can account for perhaps a third of Ml growth over the last
two months. First, the recent surge in mortgage refinancing has
raised demand deposit accounts; staff estimates suggest that
refinancings increased demand deposits by roughly $2 billion in
September and an additional $3 billion in October. Second, as
required under the recent tightening of loopholes in Regulation D,
has ceased its special sweep account program. The
resulting reclassification of large time deposits as other checkable
deposits implied an increase of about $1-1/2 billion to Ml and M2 on
a monthly average basis in October. Lastly, shipments of currency

abroad, the bulk of which was apparently directed to Eastern Europe,
have boosted currency growth. This measure, however, may overstate
actual net currency shipments, as outflows of currency are captured
more accurately than are reflows back into the U.S.
The growth of Ml continued to account for all of the expansion
of M2. The nontransaction component of M2 fell at an annual rate of
2 percent in October, as the first increase in retail money market
mutual funds since May and the rapid expansion of overnight RPs and
Eurodollar deposits were more than offset by redemptions of small
time deposits. Anecdotal reports suggest that the increase in money
funds accompanied a substantial drop in net inflows to stock and
bond funds in October.
Despite the pickup in M2, M3 growth slowed in September and
came to a halt in October. Non-M2 M3 fell at a 23 percent annual
rate in October, primarily the result of the continuing runoff in
large time deposits. Issuance of CDs by branches and agencies of
foreign banks (Yankee CDs) was particularly weak around quarter-end.
Institution-only money market funds, which had been growing rapidly,
were unchanged in September and fell markedly in October, also
reflecting in part quarter-end effects. Some investors are very
sensitive to the spread between the rate paid on these funds and RP
rates, a spread that typically narrows on settlement days and around
quarter-ends. September 30 ended both a maintenance period and a
quarter, heightening window-dressing pressures and sending RP rates
above the typical money fund rate, inducing huge net redemptions.
Bank credit grew at a 4 percent rate in October, down from its
6-3/4 percent pace in September, as a slowdown in loan growth more
than offset an increased pace of securities acquisitions.
Nonetheless, the increase in loans in October was the second
consecutive monthly rise after four months of decline.

Bank lending of all types slowed in October. After increasing
at a 5-1/2 percent rate in September, business loans contracted
slightly in October. The relative strength of business loans in
September stands in contrast to the substantial runoffs in the
preceding ten months, and may have reflected in part cutbacks in
initial public stock offerings, some of the proceeds of which had
been used to pay down bank debt. Real estate loans increased at a
4-1/2 percent rate in October, only a bit below September's pace and
the third highest monthly rate this year; more than half the October
increase, however, was the result of acquisitions of real estate
loans from failed thrift institutions. Consumer loan growth in
October was held down by increased securitization of such loans,
which resulted in a decline in bank holdings of these loans at a
rate of nearly 5 percent; adjusted for securitizations, the growth
of consumer loans was unchanged from September at about 2 percent.
Business Finance
Net borrowing by nonfinancial businesses appears to have
remained subdued in October. Last month, business loans at banks
were about unchanged, and gross public issuance of bonds, while
keeping at September's rapid pace in October, was mostly directed
toward debt refinancing. The pace of bond issuance was greatest
early in the month; it slowed markedly when rising rates made
refinancing less attractive. Commercial paper issuance rebounded
from the quarter-end runoff in the first week of October and
continued strong thereafter, with about half the net increase
intended to finance an acquisition.
Over the intermeeting period, yield spreads on investment-grade
corporate bonds widened further, bringing the cumulative increase
since mid-September to 10 to 20 basis points. These spreads likely
owe part of their rise to sales of corporate securities by some

III-8
property-casualty insurance companies in the wake of Hurricanes
Andrew and Iniki. In addition, Marriot's announcement of plans to
split the company into a debt-free hotel management corporation and
a debt-laden real estate corporation reawakened concern about event
risk and increased yields on debt of companies for which similar
restructurings might prove attractive. Adding to the negative tone
in the market, reports circulated that dealers were meeting
increasing resistance to the supply of new corporate issues and
Moody's placed General Motors' bonds on credit watch.
Yield spreads on junk bonds have been under pressure as well in
recent months and are up about 1/2 percentage point since their
trough in early June, although they are still down 1 percentage
point since January. Junk bond issuance remained brisk in October
at more than $4 billion, the second highest monthly reading this
year. A few planned offerings, however, were postponed last month
because of the backup in interest rates. Because most of the
offerings of junk bonds have been for debt refinancings,
postponements do not have the same immediate disruptive consequences
as in 1989 and 1990, when they often prevented the financing of
acquisitions and buyouts. Reflecting investors' higher demand for
quality, many junk bond mutual funds reported in October the first
outflows of the year; previous inflows were substantial and probably
contributed to the sizable drop in spreads from January to June.
Of late, a few large issuers of commercial paper have
experienced negative ratings actions. Dealers report some
difficulty in placing paper through the year-end for weaker credits.
Moreover, after Moody's and Duff & Phelps placed GMAC on credit
watch, investors demanded a premium of 10 to 15 basis points on its
paper. Following the recent downgrades of Sears Roebuck Acceptance
Corporation and Westinghouse Credit Corporation (WCC), two sizable

III-9
direct issuers of commercial paper, market participants also have
become concerned about the capacity of the market to absorb the
further increases in medium-grade paper that would occur if GMAC
were downgraded a notch as well. Reflecting that concern, WCC
announced last week that it would pay down commercial paper, turning
instead to bank loans for short-term financing.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations picked up
slightly in October, staying about in line, at $3.2 billion, with
the slower pace evident since June; volume was bolstered by Ford's
$1.0 billion offering of preferred stock. Nonfinancial IPO volume
increased in October but remained at only half its pace early in the
year. Issuance by financial firms was fairly strong, reflecting the
$1.1 billion sale of Preferred Equity Redemption Cumulative (PERC)
stock by Citicorp.
On balance, stock prices have moved up since the last FOMC
meeting. The NYSE composite has risen about 3 percent, while the
Dow Jones Industrial index is up 2 percent. The lesser gain of the
Dow partly reflects weakness in the share prices of IBM and
Westinghouse, both of which reported disappointing third-quarter
earnings. In addition, the turmoil leading up to the management
shakeup at GM, the continued flow of red ink at that firm in the
third quarter, and the anticipated slashing of its common dividend
weighed heavily on GM's stock price and the DJIA. Paced by a
revival in high-tech and biotech stock prices (perhaps bolstered by
hopes of Clinton Administration support), the NASDAQ index has
jumped about 9 percent. Both money center and regional bank indexes
have surged, bettering the performance of the S&P500.

substantial drawdown of the cash balance. Thus far in the fourth
quarter, the Treasury has increased the gross issuance in the weekly
bill auctions from $20.4 billion to $23.6 billion, more than
reversing the sharp reductions in auction sizes in the third
quarter. Meanwhile, gross coupon auctions have been increased as
much as $500 million. The staff anticipates further increases in
both bill and coupon auction sizes and that the Treasury will sell a
long-term cash management bill to mature after the April 1993 tax
payment date.
The Treasury is in the midst of its mid-quarter refunding,
selling $37 billion of securities. The $11-1/4 billion sale of
"ten-year" notes is a reopening of the current on-the-run security
in order to alleviate an "acute, protracted shortage." In the
Treasury's view, the persistence over several months of that note's
concessionary rate in the financing market, its position below the
rest of the yield curve, and widespread fails-to-deliver constitute
evidence of a lasting shortage. This first test of the reopening
policy stated in the Joint Report on the Government Securities
Market went well, with strong demand at the auction and some
narrowing of spreads in the term financing market.
Legislation regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was signed
into law by President Bush on October 29. The legislation
establishes a new Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight
within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to be funded
by assessments on the agencies based on their assets and mortgage-
backed securities. The legislation requires that the financial
condition of each of the two agencies be examined at least annually
and imposes minimum capital levels.

III-12
Municipal Securities
Yields on long-term municipal bonds moved up about 35 basis
points in October but fell back somewhat in November. On balance
since late July, tax-exempt rates have risen nearly 60 basis points,
boosting the ratio of tax-exempt to Treasury yields from a midsummer
low of 0.83 to 0.87.
Gross issuance of long-term debt has run at an extremely heavy
pace in the past three months. A substantial volume of gross
issuance came from advance refundings in the third quarter, as rates
were low and many issuers rushed offerings in anticipation of future
rate increases. Retirements reportedly have slowed after an
extraordinary surge in early July, but they are likely to continue
to restrain overall debt growth of this sector.1
According to market reports, tax-exempt mutual funds
experienced outflows in October after recording strong inflows
throughout the year. This probably explains part of the relative
poor performance of municipal yields that month, as mutual funds are
the predominant buyer in this market, accounting for more than
85 percent of the net increase in tax-exempt securities outstanding
during the first half of the year. Reflecting hurricane losses,
sales of municipal bonds by property-casualty insurance companies,
another significant group of investors, have added to the pressure
on rates.
Bond issuance has fallen markedly in the past week. especially
refunding issues. Moreover, net issuance is expected to decline
sharply in January, when about $8 billion in municipal debt is
likely to be called (and financed in part by maturing SLGSs). As a

July 1, 1992, representing about 1 percent of outstanding municipal
bonds. Another $5 billion was retired during the rest of the third
quarter, and retirements are expected to be around $5 billion in the
fourth quarter, according to several market analysts.

result of this decline, and perhaps also because investors are
contemplating a fiscal package early in the new administration that
includes higher marginal tax rates, yields on tax-exempt securities
recently backed down about 10 basis points.

and high interest rate volatility put pressure on these spreads
(chart).
Fifteen-year and balloon mortgages have become more popular in
recent years. In 1992, only about 40 percent of the thirty-year,
fixed-rate mortgages that FHLMC had previously purchased have been
refinanced by another thirty-year mortgage, down from nearly
80 percent three years ago (chart). Fifteen-year mortgages have
grown to about 40 percent, and five- and seven-year balloon
mortgages to about 10 percent, of FHLMC refinancing activity.
Recent legislation has enacted several significant changes to
the mortgage insurance program of the Federal Housing Administration
(FHA) and the mortgage guarantee program of the Veterans
Administration (VA). In particular, changes to the FHA program are
expected to make FHA mortgages less costly and easier to obtain,
thereby increasing the volume of FHA loan originations. One change,
increasing the maximum loan size, is not likely to have much effect,
because the average loan size is substantially below the old
maximum. Another change is more significant, as it repeals the 57
percent limitation on the amount of closing costs that the loan can
finance. This limit was widely perceived as having constrained the
volume of FHA mortgage loans by increasing the amount of cash
required at closing. Changes to the VA mortgage guarantee program
expand the pool of eligible borrowers, lower the refinancing cost
for veterans, and authorize the VA for the first time to guarantee
adjustable-rate mortgages. Also for the first time and effective
immediately, interest rates on VA-guaranteed mortgages are no longer
constrained by a VA-administered ceiling rate, but, like other
mortgage rates, are free to be determined by market forces.

III-17
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in September, following seven
months of decline. The increase in September reflected rebounds in
both automobile loans and revolving credit, while runoffs continued
in the "other loans" category. The 4-1/4 percent gain in auto
credit was the largest since October 1989; in the intervening
period, the stock of auto debt had shrunk by 12 percent. The upturn
in revolving credit follows a six-month period of notable weakness.
The ratio of outstanding installment credit to disposable
personal income was 16.3 percent in September, the lowest since mid-
1985 (chart). Estimated principal and interest payments also have
continued to trend down relative to disposable income, as lower
interest rates and the net paydowns of outstanding balances have
enabled consumers to reduce the cash flow burden of outstanding
credit.
Over the past dozen years a number of nonfinancial firms have
entered the third-party credit card market, most often through the
medium of a nationally chartered bank, which enabled these firms to
"export" the interest rate charged in their home states and avoid
the ceilings imposed by the state of residence of the cardholder.
Under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended, these banks
generally fall into two types: "nonbank banks," for example. Sears
(Greenwood Trust; Discover card) and American Express (American
Express Centurion Bank; Optima card); and "credit card banks," for
example, General Electric (Monogram Credit Card Bank) and Household
Finance (two banks). Passage of the Competitive Equality in Banking
Act (CEBA) in 1987 essentially precluded establishment of any more
nonbank banks, but it grandfathered existing entities and limited
their asset growth to 7 percent per year. However, CEBA also

established the separate category of credit card banks, which it
exempted from both the BHC Act and growth limitations.3 After
AT&T introduced the no-fee AT&T/Universal card as a Visa or
MasterCard product in 1990, banks complained to the two licensing
organizations, which subsequently modified their membership rules to
make it difficult, if not impossible, for a firm owned by a
nondepository to join the Visa or MasterCard system. To circumvent
this constraint, some nondepositories have adopted the practice of
"co-branding," whereby a nonfinancial firm wishing to establish a
national credit card program reaches an agreement with an existing
member of MasterCard or VISA to share billing on the face of the
card.
In the past couple of months, two major nonfinancial
corporations--General Motors and General Electric--have each
introduced a new credit card as a co-branded MasterCard.
Furthermore, GTE has begun issuing a combined MasterCard-telephone
charge card through a co-branding arrangement with Associates
National Bank (Ford). There are reports that other telephone
companies may enter into such arrangements as well and that Chrysler
may soon join the credit card club. So far, however, the increased
competition has had no notable effect on the price or quantity of
credit, as loan balances have merely been shifted among
institutions.
Gross public issuance of credit card-backed securities has been
sluggish so far this year, in part reflecting slow growth of
receivables as well as the much improved state of bank balance
sheets and capital positions (table). However, even in the absence
of any new cards, issuance of card-backed securities is expected to

Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened sharply in August to
$9.0 billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis), up from a revised
July deficit of $7.3 billion. A 6 percent drop in exports far
outweighed the 1 percent decline in imports, leading to the largest
monthly U.S. trade deficit since November 1990. The decline in
exports in August was widespread across all major trade categories,
while the decline in imports was concentrated in oil, foods, and
consumer goods.

For July-August combined, the trade deficit widened to $105
billion at an annual rate (BOP basis). Exports were little changed
from the second quarter, while imports increased by 2-1/2 percent.
Beginning in the second quarter of 1992 there appears to have been
an upward shift in the level of the trade deficit after five
consecutive quarters of deficits in the $60-80 billion (AR) range.
Most of the increase in non-oil imports in July-August was in
capital goods and consumer goods. Computers accounted for much of
the increase in imported capital goods. U.S. domestic sales of

computers were very strong, fueled by price wars and by a push by
U.S. businesses to upgrade PCs and workstations to take advantage of
improved software. Most of the increased sales were in the low end
of the computer spectrum, items that are often imported. Other
machinery imports also rose strongly in July-August; the increase in
these imports since the end of 1991 represents the first significant
advance in this category since 1988 and is consistent with some
firming in domestic spending for these goods.
Imports of oil fell in August, as both quantity and price
declined from the levels recorded in July. The noticeable decline
in the quantity of oil imported in August largely reflected a
decrease in domestic stocks (after four months of increase or no
change), and to a lesser extent the effects of the temporary
shutdown of the Louisiana Offshore Oil Pipeline (LOOP) brought about
by Hurricane Andrew. For July-August combined, however, imports of
oil were above the second-quarter pace, reflecting the strong level
of imports in July. Preliminary Department of Energy data for
September indicate a drop in oil consumption and an increase in
stocks; imports in September (BOP basis) may have tipped up
slightly.

recently have combined to depress oil prices. Spot WTI currently
stands at $20.49 per barrel. These movements in spot prices suggest
that import prices were little changed from the August level in
either September or October.
Exports rose slightly in July-August from the second-quarter
average, but were still only slightly higher than in the fourth
quarter of 1991. The quantity of exports remained essentially flat,
as increases in exports of computers, automotive products, and
agricultural products (particularly wheat, rice, and soybeans) were
offset by declines in exports of aircraft and other products. By
area, a downward turn in exports to Western Europe was offset by
increased exports to Latin America and developing nations in Asia.
Prices of Exports and Non-oil Imports
Non-oil import prices rose by about 4-1/2 percent at an annual
rate in the third quarter according to the BLS, following a decline
in the previous quarter. Strong price increases in imports of
capital goods were attributable in part to the depreciation of the
dollar over the summer. Prices of imported consumer goods and
automotive products also rose noticeably in the third quarter.
Prices of non-agricultural exports rose only slightly in the
third quarter, while prices of agricultural exports fell sharply.
continuing the price declines of the previous three quarters.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Partial data on international capital transactions for the
third quarter indicate large inflows of private capital, especially
through bank transactions, and sizable outflows of official capital.
This pattern represents a shift from that in recent quarters when
official transactions showed large net inflows and accounted for the
bulk of the total net capital inflows. Despite the substantial
increase in private capital inflows in the third quarter, total net

IV-6
inflows thus far reported for the quarter were substantially less
than the projected current account deficit, indicating a large
positive statistical discrepancy. In the first half of the year,
the discrepancy was large and negative. Part, but not all, of the
swing in the discrepancy appears to have been associated with larger
currency shipments abroad, which are omitted from the accounts.
Banks in the United States recorded large net inflows in August
and September, bringing the total for the third quarter to $20
billion. (See line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table.) Most of the September inflow was attributable
to end-of-quarter transactions by U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks. As a group, these banks increased their net
liabilities to related foreign offices by about $15 billion in the
last weeks of September and reduced these liabilities by more than
$6 billion in the early days of October. Averaging through the
quarter-end movements, it still appears that the foreign-based banks
have increased their reliance on related foreign offices for funds
in recent months. As shown on line lb of the International Banking
Table, on a monthly average basis, foreign-chartered banks in the
United States increased their net liabilities to own foreign offices
by $10 billion between August and October. This figure is roughly
consistent with the asset growth at branches and agencies and the
runoff of large CDs issued by them in the United States.
Net purchases of U.S. corporate and agency bonds by private
foreigners picked up in August and remained brisk in September,
bringing total purchases to $7 billion for the quarter. (See line
2a of the Summary Table.) Private foreign purchases of Treasury
securities, especially bonds and notes, also picked up in August,
reaching almost $8 billion (line 3). These purchases were
concentrated in the United Kingdom and Japan. In September

foreigners made net sales of Treasuries totaling $3 billion.
Widespread sales by Europeans more than offset Japanese net
purchases of almost $3-1/2 billion. For the quarter as a whole,
private foreigners purchased less than $6 billion in Treasuries,
about one-half of the amount purchased in the second quarter.
Foreigners resumed selling U.S. equities on a modest scale in
August and picked up the pace of net sales in September. For the
quarter, net sales of equities totaled almost $4 billion, about
equal to the total sales in the first two quarters (line 2b).
U.S. residents continued to acquire foreign securities,
especially European equities, in August and September, though at a
somewhat slower pace than in July. For the third quarter net
purchases of stocks and bonds totaled almost $15 billion (line 2c).
Foreign official reserves in the United States declined $13
billion in September. Most of the decline was attributable to
reduced holdings by the BIS and Canada.
Large reductions in French, Spanish, and Swedish
reserves were offset by increases in German and U.K. reserves.
Partial data for October indicate that official reserves at The
FRBNY rose more than $5 billion as a $9 billion increase in BIS
holdings was only partially offset by reductions in Spanish, German,
and Swiss holdings.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average value of the dollar, shown in the
accompanying chart, rose 9 percent since the last FOMC meeting. The

IV-10
dollar began appreciating shortly after the meeting as market
expectations for further Federal Reserve easing dissipated. It
continued to rise on German interest rates declines, and on the
expectation that a Clinton administration would use fiscal policy to
stimulate the economy, reducing the likelihood for further easing by
the Federal Reserve.
The dollar rose 12 percent against the mark during the period,
but rose only 3-1/2 percent against the yen in part because
expectations for monetary easing in Japan have been more subdued
than those in Europe, and perhaps also because the huge Japanese
trade surplus continued to widen. Interest rates in Japan changed
little during the period; the three-month CD rate declined 5 basis
points, and the yield on the bellwether bond declined 10 basis
points.
Expectations for Bundesbank easing were mixed toward the end of
the period because the impetus for easing posed by evidence of a
weakening German economy was offset by stubborn German inflation, a
growing budget deficit, and upcoming wage negotiations. Market
commentary also suggests that the Bundesbank will postpone further
rate cuts pending anticipated devaluations of the weaker ERM
currencies by year-end. Three-month rates in Germany declined 5
basis points to 8.85 percent during the period. They had been down
by more, but rebounded towards the end of the period. The yield on
the bellwether bond declined 5 basis points to 7.30 percent.
Elsewhere in Europe, interest rate movements were more
pronounced due to an unwinding of exchange rate pressures and the
pursuit of more growth-oriented monetary policies.
In the United Kingdom, three-month rates declined just over 200
basis points to about 7 percent, reflecting a shift in government
priorities from inflation reduction to the pursuit of economic

growth. This shift towards growth-oriented policies came in
response to further signs of economic deterioration, and was also a
part of government efforts to appease critics of its proposal to
shut-down several government-owned coal pits. Three-month rates are
currently 330 basis points below their average level in August, and
the market expects base rates to decline an additional 175 basis
points over the next few months.
Three-month rates in Italy declined 240 basis points during the
period but remain 250 basis points above their average level in
June, before the exchange rate pressures on the lira intensified.
Since the last meeting, Italy has succeeded in passing several
budget deficit reduction measures, and the lira has strengthened
7-3/4 percent against the mark. Italian government officials have
hinted that the lira may reenter the ERM around year's end.
Three-month rates in France and Sweden declined 290-350 basis
point over the period, mostly in response to reduced exchange rate
pressures. Three-month rates in France are 95 basis points below
their level in August, and the spread between French and German
three-month rates is currently narrower than its average level in
August.
In Spain, although some exchange rate pressures persist, three-
month rates declined 145 basis points to 13.90 percent, perhaps
because capital controls instituted during the EMS crisis have
provided the Bank of Spain with some room to maneuver rates lower.
By European Community agreement, these capital controls, as well as
those in Ireland, must be removed by the end of this year. At the
time of their removal the market expects the peseta and the Irish
punt, as well as the Portuguese escudo to be devalued 5-10 percent.
In Canada voters overwhelmingly rejected a referendum on
constitutional reforms on October 26. This rejection was widely

IV-13
anticipated and had only a minor effect on the Canadian dollar.
Three-month rates in Canada declined 80 basis points on balance
during the period. These rates had declined by more, but downward
pressure on the Canadian dollar prompted the Bank of Canada to
tighten somewhat towards the end of the period. The Canadian dollar
declined 1-1/4 percent, on balance, against the U.S. dollar during
the period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Real economic activity in major foreign industrial countries
has proceeded at a sluggish pace in the third quarter. In Japan,
incoming data for industrial production, inventories, and new car
registrations continued to suggest weakness. Similarly, for western
Germany and the United Kingdom, industrial production, orders, and
measures of business confidence are down relative to the second
quarter. In addition, real activity appears to be slowing in France
and Italy. In contrast, a recovery may have taken hold in Canada
during the third quarter, as industrial production, orders, and
retail sales showed moderate increases. Moderation in economic
activity has generally led to lower inflation, except in western
Germany.
Individual country notes. In Japan, activity appears to have
remained generally weak in the third quarter. While industrial
production (s.a.) rose 4.6 percent in September, this mainly
reflected recovery from an unusually sharp seasonal drop in the
previous month. For the third quarter as a whole, industrial

production was only 0.1 percent higher than in the second quarter,
and was 6.3 percent below its year-earlier level. The inventories
to shipments ratio (s.a.) rose an additional 0.6 percent in the
third quarter, and showed a year-over-year increase of 8.2 percent.
Retail sales (n.s.a.) in the third quarter were 1.8 percent below
their level in the third quarter of last year. New passenger car
registrations (s.a.) declined 2.6 percent in the third quarter and
fell 10.8 percent below their year-earlier level. Housing starts
(s.a.) have continued to be the strongest indicator, registering a
2.9 percent increase in the third quarter. The unemployment rate
(s.a.) in September remained unchanged at 2.2 percent. However, the
job offers to applicants ratio (s.a.) continued to decline, falling
to its lowest level in four years.
Inflationary pressures have remained subdued. Consumer prices
in the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) were nearly unchanged in October, and
their 12-month change declined to 1.2 percent. However, much of the
decline in the 12-month change over recent months was due to lower
prices of perishable foods. Excluding perishable food prices, the
12-month change in consumer prices was 2.3 percent in October.
Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) declined by 0.3 percent in September, as
their 12-month decrease remained at 1.1 percent.
The trade surplus (s.a.) increased somewhat further in
September. For the first nine months of the year, the trade surplus
was $79 billion (s.a.), 38 percent higher than the surplus in the
same period last year.
The downturn in real economic activity in western Germany
registered in the second quarter appears to have persisted into the
third quarter. Industrial production (s.a.) dropped 1.9 percent in
the third quarter relative to its average in the second quarter and
in September was significantly below its level in the fourth quarter

IV-18
of last year. The volume of new orders for west German manufactured
goods (s.a.) fell steadily between February and September. For the
third quarter, total orders declined 2.3 percent relative to their
second-quarter average, reflecting a drop in both domestic and
foreign orders. Measures of business confidence have exhibited
sharp declines in recent months. One survey of production plans in
September registered its steepest drop since the end of 1982. On a
slightly more positive note, the volume of retail sales (s.a.) was
essentially unchanged in the third quarter relative to the second
quarter average. Despite increasing in March and April on a
year/year basis, industrial production in eastern Germany (n.s.a.)
has declined in more recent months and in July stood 5.1 percent
below year-earlier levels.
After remaining steady throughout 1991 at roughly 6.3 percent,
the unemployment rate (s.a.) in western Germany has edged up this
year and stood at 6.6 percent in October.
Consumer price inflation (n.s.a.) in western Germany remained
strong through October, increasing to 3.8 percent on a year/year
basis. Other prices have moderated somewhat in recent months,
likely reflecting the appreciation of the DM against its major
trading partners.
The combined German current account has continued to
deteriorate. The cumulative current account deficit (n.s.a.) for
all of Germany reached $18.5 billion in August, about $2 billion
larger than the deficit through August of last year. The widening
of the current account deficit primarily reflects a decline in the
value of exports.
In September, M3 in western and eastern Germany combined was
9.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) higher than in the fourth quarter of 1991,
well above the Bundesbank's M3 target range of 3-1/2 to 5-1/2

IV-19
percent growth for 1992. Three-month interest rates have continued
to drift down slowly since the official Bundesbank easing on
September 14 that reduced the discount and Lombard rates to 8.25 and
9.5 percent, respectively, and now stand between 8.8 and 8.9
percent.
In early September, the draft budget and medium-term financial
plan that was approved by the German cabinet in July was presented
to the German parliament. Over the past several weeks, however, the
draft budget for 1993 has been the subject of considerable
controversy. The Finance Ministry now estimates a gap of DM 16
billion between expenditures and revenues in the draft budget, due
to a drop in expected tax revenues and to additional financial
obligations in eastern Germany. To bridge the DM 16 billion gap,
the cabinet has approved a series of measures, including expenditure
reduction, additional borrowing, and additional revenues through
privatization receipts and coin sales. This modified 1993 draft
budget continues to hold the growth of expenditures to 2.5 percent
in nominal terms, but the Federal deficit is now expected to
increased to DM 44 billion from a projected deficit of DM 40.5
billion this year. No mention has been made of additional taxes in
1993, but there has been discussion of tax increases in 1995.
In France, monthly indicators point to continued weakness in
the third quarter. Although the July-August average of industrial
production was flat (s.a.), output in the manufacturing sector
declined 1.2 percent relative to June. It is likely that production
continued to trend down in September, as the Bank of France's
measure of industrial output fell in that month. The unemployment
rate edged up in the third quarter to 10.3 percent (s.a.). In
addition, foreign and domestic orders and business confidence all
fell (s.a.) in September. The only positive indicator was real

IV-20
consumption of manufactured products (a third of total consumption),
which rose 1.2 percent (s.a.) in September, to lie 0.5 percent above
its second-quarter average.
Inflation in September continued it gradual decline. The
consumer price index was 2.6 percent above its year-earlier level,
down slightly from 2.7 percent in August.
Through September, France's cumulative trade surplus was $4.3
billion (s.a.), a substantial improvement relative to $5.7 billion
deficit registered over the same period last year. This favorable
trade balance performance masks a significant slowdown in French
export growth that has contributed to the slowdown in overall
economic growth. In the third quarter, French merchandise exports
(s.a.) were 2.2 percent below their average in the first half of
1992, and slightly below their level in the third quarter of last
year.
On October 27, the French Chamber of Deputies approved the 1993
budget. The deficit is projected to equal FF165 billion or 2.2
percent of GDP, slightly less than the 1992 deficit now estimated at
FF180 billion. The increase in total expenditures is to be held to
3.4 percent in 1993, although certain categories of expenditures
such as job training, agriculture, education, and justice will
increase by significantly more. Tax revenues are projected to rise
only 2.9 percent, largely due to very slow growth in VAT and
corporate income tax revenues, and a small reduction in the
corporate income tax rate.
In Italy, economic growth is slowing. Recently released
figures show that real GDP grew only 0.8 percent (s.a.a.r) in the
second quarter compared with 2.4 percent (s.a.a.r) in the first
quarter. Other recent indicators suggest that this slowdown in
activity continued into the third quarter. Industrial production

IV-21
(n.s.a.) declined 3.7 percent in the 12 months ending in August, and
new orders fell 1.6 percent in the year ending in July. Although
retail sales in July were up 7.8 percent from July 1991, the rate of
increase was slower than those recorded earlier this year. The
consumer confidence index in September plunged 9.3 percent (n.s.a)
from July's level (the survey is not conducted in August) and lies
15.5 percent lower than in September 1991. A rebound in consumer
confidence is unlikely in the near term due to higher taxes and
lower wage growth.
For the year ending in October, Italian consumer prices rose 5
percent from year-earlier levels. Since June, consumer price
increases have been trending down on a year/year basis. Wholesale
prices were up 1.7 percent, for the year ending in August. The
inflation rate should rise in the coming months as the effective 15
percent devaluation of the lira begins to affect prices. Another
wage-price spiral may ensue if the unions succeed in demanding the
reinstatement of the scala mobile, Italy's recently abolished system
of wage indexation.
Approximately 25 percent of the 93 trillion lira (roughly $71
billion equivalent) 1993 deficit reduction package has been approved
by Parliament. On October 22, the lower house approved an
additional 50 percent of the package and sent it to the upper house
where the measure is predicted to pass a confidence vote. Budget
committees in both houses are currently debating the remaining 25
percent of the package. This progress in fiscal consolidation,
together with general easing of exchange market tensions and
faltering Italian growth, induced the Bank of Italy to lower the
discount rate 100 basis points to 14 percent on October 23. Another
discount rate cut is likely when Parliament approves the remaining
portions of the deficit reduction package.

IV-22
Latest data for the United Kingdom indicate that the economy
may be contracting again. Industrial production (s.a.) fell 0.3
percent in August after rising 1 percent in July. (The July
increase was entirely accounted for by a resumption in energy
production after spring maintenance on North Sea oilfields was
completed.) Manufacturing production (s.a.) contracted 0.3 percent
in August to a level 0.5 percent below a year ago. In October, the
CBI's industrial survey indicated that recovery is unlikely to be
led by the corporate sector. Business confidence and investment
intentions continued to recede, reversing most of the rise that
occurred earlier this year.
Consumer spending has picked up slightly in recent months; the
volume of retail sales (s.a.) rose 1.2 percent in August and 0.2
percent in September to stand 1.5 percent above a year ago. In the
third quarter, sales were 0.5 percent higher than in the previous
quarter and at their highest level since the first half of 1990.
However, in October consumer confidence fell again to its lowest
level since 1990, pointing to weak sales in the current quarter.
Unemployment (s.a.) continued to rise in September to a rate of 10.1
percent.
Inflation continues to be moderate, despite the depreciation of
the pound. Consumer prices (n.s.a.) rose 0.4 percent in September
after rising 0.1 percent in August. The 12-month inflation rate
remained at 3.6 percent, the lowest since 1986. Excluding mortgage
interest rates, consumer prices were 4 percent above their level of
September 1991, at the upper boundary of the government's new
inflation target of 1-4 percent. Producers' output prices (n.s.a.)
rose slightly in October after they stood still in September and
were 3.3 percent above their year-earlier level. The prices of
producers' materials and fuels (n.s.a.) rose 2.5 in October after

IV-23
rising 1.1 percent in September, largely reflecting price increases
of imported materials associated with sterling's devaluation.
Despite continued weakness in domestic demand, the trade
balance (s.a.) deteriorated substantially in the third quarter. The
cumulative current account deficit (s.a.) for the first three
quarters of the year was $13.5 billion, compared with a deficit of
$7.3 billion in the same period of 1991.
In Canada, economic indicators for the third quarter suggest a
resumption of recovery after four quarters of very slow growth.
Monthly GDP at factor cost (s.a.) for July-August combined came in
0.5 percent above its second-quarter average, as industrial
production increased 0.4 percent, retail sales (s.a.) were up 1.3
percent, and factory orders (s.a.) rose 0.9 percent. In the third
quarter as a whole, housing starts (s.a.) increased 6.7 percent and
total employment (s.a.) rose 0.1 percent. The unemployment rate
(s.a.) fell to 11.3 percent in October, its second consecutive
monthly decline.
Recent price data show continued success for the Bank of
Canada's efforts to reduce base inflation. The 12-month change in
the CPI, excluding food and energy (n.s.a.), fell to 1.6 percent in
September. The all-items CPI was up 1.3 percent over this period.
Although wholesale prices (n.s.a.) rose 0.5 percent in September,
they stand only 2.1 percent above their year-earlier level. Wage
settlements increased an average of 2.4 percent (a.r.) during the
first eight months of the year, compared with a 3.6 percent average
for all of 1991 and 5.6 percent in 1990.
The current account deficit (s.a.a.r.) widened slightly in the
second quarter to $25.1 billion, as a rebound in imports caused a
moderate decline in Canada's merchandise trade surplus. For July-
August combined, the trade surplus (s.a.a.r.) was $6.7 billion, up

IV-24
from $5.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting continued rapid
growth in exports.
On Monday October 26, Canadians voting in a non-binding
referendum decisively rejected an agreement on constitutional reform
reached by Prime Minister Mulroney and the ten provincial premiers
in August. Although the stated purpose of the proposals was to
foster national unity, failure to adopt the plan is not likely to
lead to a dissolution of the Canadian federation. Financial markets
have reacted favorably to the apparent resolution of some of the
political uncertainty associated with the referendum vote.
The Former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
Inflation in Russia accelerated sharply in September. It
appears that a substantial volume of new central bank credits were
granted in late August and early September to both reduce the volume
of inter-enterprise arrears and to support Russian exports to other
countries in the ruble area. Retail prices are reported to have
increased about 25 percent in September, after increasing 11 and 10
percent in July and August, respectively. Since the beginning of
September the external value of the ruble has declined by almost
half.
The pace of output declines appears to have slowed in
September. Industrial production is reported to have been 28 to 29
percent below year-earlier levels in September, compared with 27
percent in August, and 21 percent in July.
In late October the Supreme Soviet (parliament) turned down
President Yeltsin's request to delay a meeting of the Congress of
People's Deputies scheduled for December 1, Opposition leaders have
said that they plan to use the Congress, which is Russia's highest
political body, to force changes in the Russian cabinet, including
the ouster of acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar.

IV-25
In Poland, the government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka has
introduced several pieces of economic legislation that attempt to
address the continuing fiscal crisis and the stalled privatization
program. The fiscal deficit, which was targeted to be 5 percent of
GDP in 1992, is now expected to be closer to 8 percent. Despite the
poor fiscal situation, the real economy shows signs of improvement,
with positive performance in industrial output and exports.
The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR) is scheduled to
divide into two independent countries on January 1, 1993. The
impending breakup has raised many uncertainties about future
economic policies. Slovak leaders have already said that they
intend to move away from the privatization measures adopted by the
federal government, which to date have been successful.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
Mexico's tight fiscal and monetary policies are constraining
real GDP growth. International reserves fell by an estimated $1.4
billion in the past six months, despite sharply higher domestic
interest rates. The authorities have taken steps to allow the peso
to depreciate somewhat more in 1993 than in 1992. Brazil's economic
activity remains depressed, and inflation continues to be high, amid
unceasing political turmoil. No progress is being made in getting
the IMF stand-by arrangement back on track. In Argentina,
industrial sales this year are rising. Continuing appreciation of
the real exchange rate and deterioration of the trade and current
accounts have prompted the government to waive all taxes on export
goods and to raise the basic tax rate on imports. Final agreement
on the debt reduction package seems to be imminent. In Venezuela,
real GDP growth exceeds 8 percent in 1992. Overvaluation of the
bolivar and a large fiscal deficit led the central bank to allow a
10 percent currency depreciation in October. Tight monetary policy

IV-26
in Korea continues to reduce inflationary pressures, and the trade
deficit is falling. In Taiwan, slower real GDP growth prompted the
central bank to lower its discount rate. Public investment is
rising strongly this year as an ambitious development program begins
to be implemented. The trade surplus continues to narrow.
Individual country notes. Mexico's tight fiscal and monetary
policies are likely to hold 1992 real GDP growth to about the same
rate (2.8 percent) as in the first half of the year. These policies
are yielding a public sector fiscal surplus, excluding privatization
proceeds, and slowing twelve-month inflation toward single-digit
rates, a goal that the government hopes to reach next year. The CPI
rose by 0.9 percent in September and by 0.7 percent in October,
leaving it 14.8 percent higher than a year earlier.
International reserves, including gold, on October 31 were
$18.3 billion, an estimated $1.4 billion less than six months
earlier. The decline reflects a smaller capital account surplus and
a sharp increase in the current account deficit. In the first half
of 1992, the current account deficit was $10.2 billion, twice as
much as in the first half of 1991, but the capital account surplus
fell to $10.9 billion from $13.6 billion. In January-August 1992,
the trade deficit was $9.8 billion, up from $3.8 billion a year
earlier. Imports were 27.6 percent higher, but exports were only
3.6 percent higher. Manufactured exports were 9.6 percent higher,
but petroleum, agricultural, and mining products exports were lower.
The growth of manufactured exports owes much to automobile and truck
exports, which, through June, were 33.6 percent higher than a year
earlier. Other manufactured exports were only 4.3 percent higher.
On October 20, the Mexican authorities doubled the rate at
which they are depreciating the lower limit of the band within which
the peso/dollar exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate. This limit

IV-27
is now moving by 40 centavos per dollar per day, or by 4.6 percent
over a full year, up from 20 centavos. The upper, more appreciated
limit, remains fixed at 3,056.2 pesos per dollar. On November 9,
the lower limit was 3.4 percent lower than the upper limit. The
policy change was part of an extension of the anti-inflation pact
between government, business, and organized labor. The pact was due
to expire in January 1993 and will now run until the end of 1993.
The Mexican financial markets, where rumors of an imminent
devaluation were widespread, were relieved that this possibility had
receded with the policy announcement. The spot rate for the dollar
strengthened from 3,143 pesos per dollar on October 19 to 3,123
pesos on November 9, when it was 1.3 percent above the lower limit
of the band. The Mexican stock market index rose strongly on the
news. The twenty-eight-day Treasury-bill rate eased after rising
870 basis points since mid-March. At the November 4 auction, it was
18.8 percent, down from 19.7 percent on October 14.
In Brazil, economic activity remains depressed and inflation
continues to be high. Real GDP is projected to rise by only 0.3
percent in 1992, down from 0.9 percent in 1991. Monthly inflation
in October is estimated at between 25 and 27 percent, somewhat
higher than in recent months (20-24 percent). In Sao Paulo state,
which accounts for roughly one-third of the country's GDP, economic
conditions appear to be worsening. In metropolitan Sao Paulo, where
unemployment remains at about 16 percent, sales of durable goods
were 15-25 percent lower in October than a year earlier.
Overall economic performance would be even worse, were it not
for export growth and the good agricultural harvest so far this
year. In January-September 1992, exports were 10 percent higher
than in the same period of 1991, while imports were 3 percent lower.
As a result, the cumulative nine-month trade surplus was $11.7

IV-28
billion, up from $9 billion in the same period of 1991. The wider
trade surplus reflects the depressed internal demand and an improved
competitive position as a result of a 15 percent real exchange rate
depreciation between the end of 1991 and June 1992.
At the end of August, international reserves were a record $22
billion, up from $8 billion at the end of 1991, mainly due to large
capital inflows. Sterilization operations are aggravating the
fiscal problem, because of the high cost of domestic debt.
Poor economic performance reflects the loss of consumer and
investor confidence generated by political turmoil in recent months.
A congressional vote forced President Collor to step down in early
October while the Senate considers whether to impeach him for his
role in government corruption. Vice President Itamar Franco became
acting president, but he and his economic team have not yet shown
that they are serious about pushing fiscal and monetary reforms.
Brazil has made no headway in getting its IMF stand-by program
back on track. The Brady-style bank debt restructuring package is
stalled until the IMF is satisfied with Brazil's fiscal performance.
In Argentina, industrial sales were 20 percent higher in the
first eight months of 1992 than in the same period of 1991. In
October, consumer prices rose 1.3 percent and were 17.9 percent
above a year earlier. In contrast, wholesale prices were only 3.8
percent above a year earlier, reflecting competitive pressure from
imported goods. Because of the fixed peso/dollar exchange rate and
the inflation differential, the real exchange rate has appreciated
and the balance of payments has deteriorated. A trade deficit of
about $1 billion is officially forecast in 1992, in contrast to
trade surpluses throughout the past decade. To achieve a balanced
trade account during 1993, the government is waiving all taxes on
export goods (including the 18 percent VAT), and raising the basic

IV-29
tax rate on imports by 7 percent. The resulting net loss of fiscal
revenues will be made up by other tax and expenditure changes.
In early November, final agreement on the Brady-style debt
reduction package already approved by Argentina and its commercial
bank advisory committee appeared to be imminent.
Venezuela's real GDP was 8-3/4 percent higher in the first nine
months of 1992 than in the same period of 1991, mainly because
private sector output surged over 13 percent. The CPI rose by 2.3
percent in October, when it was 34 percent above a year earlier.
In October, the bolivar was allowed to depreciate by nearly 10
percent. The bolivar was under pressure owing to its progressively
larger overvaluation, concern over a large 1992 fiscal deficit, and
political uncertainty. The central bank attempted to counter this
pressure through a tight monetary policy that included stricter
enforcement of bank reserve requirements. As a result, interest
rates rose in October, until, on October 28, they spiked to record
levels of 2,600 percent in the overnight interbank market and 51
percent for 89-day central bank bills. The central bank reacted by
supplying reserves to the banking system at 60 percent, thereby
limiting interbank interest rates to that level. In early November,
the exchange rate moved narrowly around 77 bolivars per dollar.
In Korea, tight monetary policy is continuing to reduce
inflationary pressures this year. Consumer prices were 5.7 percent
higher in September than a year earlier, down from 9.4 percent in
the year ending September 1991. In the first ten months of 1992,
the trade deficit (on a customs clearance basis) narrowed to $5.4
billion from $9.9 billion in the same period of 1991. Import growth
has slowed considerably due to the slowdown in domestic demand.
In Taiwan, real GDP growth year-over-year slowed to an
estimated 5.5 percent in the third quarter of 1992. Net exports

fell, due in part to weak external demand. However, domestic
investment rose. Public investment in 1992 is likely to be about 18
percent higher than in 1991 as an ambitious six-year infrastructure
development program has begun to be implemented. Partly in response
to the slowing economy, the central bank cut its discount rate by
0.5 percent to 5.625 percent in early October, more than reversing
an increase of 0.25 percent adopted in May to fight inflation. In
October, the twelve-month increase in the CPI was 5.1 percent.
In the first ten months of 1992, exports were 7.4 percent
higher than in the same period of 1991, while imports were 13.4
percent higher. The trade surplus for the ten-month period fell to
$8.4 billion from $10.8 billion in January-October 1991, despite a
rapidly growing trade surplus with China, mainly through Hong Kong.
