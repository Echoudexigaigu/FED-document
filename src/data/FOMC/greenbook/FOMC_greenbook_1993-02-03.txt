created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The incoming data on economic activity have continued to have
a predominantly positive cast, and surveys indicate that consumers
and business executives have a greater confidence in the prospects
for sustained growth. Nonetheless, the job creation process has yet
to move into high gear--a point highlighted by the persistent
drumbeat of corporate downsizing announcements. Recent readings on
wage and consumer price changes suggest that the general
disinflationary trend remains intact, though the pickup in
manufacturing and homebuilding activity evidently has produced some
firming in materials prices.
Employment and Unemployment
Despite the continuing flow of announcements of layoffs by
major firms, the aggregate data suggest that labor demand has been
on an upward trend--albeit a rather tentative one. Nonfarm payroll
employment rose 64,000 in December--the fourth consecutive month of
small job gains. The civilian unemployment rate held steady in
December at 7.3 percent, as the labor force participation rate edged
upward. The jobless rate in December was about 1/2 percentage point
below its midyear peak, but still slightly above the level at the
beginning of the year.

Since the December survey week, weekly initial claims for
unemployment insurance (adjusted to include the EUC program) have
remained below 400,000--suggesting that another modest rise in
employment in January is likely. In addition, the Conference
Board's January survey of consumers showed a further improvement in
respondents' assessments of current job availability.
In the December payroll survey, private employment advanced
86,000, similar to the average gain in October and November.1
Hiring at service establishments accounted for much of the increase
over this period, especially in business and health services
industries. As was the case for most of last year, the growth in
business services was concentrated at temporary help agencies,
suggesting that employers remained reluctant to add permanent
workers to their payrolls--either as they await further evidence of
a sustained improvement in demand or because such "outsourcing" is
simply less costly. The current and prospective fixed costs of
benefits, especially health care, apparently are an important factor
in the reluctance of many firms to hire new workers; in retail
trade, employment rose 15,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis in
December, but on the whole, hiring in this sector has remained
sluggish.
In the goods-producing sector, manufacturing and construction
payrolls were little changed in December. Although the employment
picture in manufacturing and construction has improved from the
sizable net reduction in jobs seen in 1990 and 1991, no substantial
pickup in hiring in either of these areas is, as yet, evident.
Moreover, surveys of manufacturers do not point to widespread plans
to increase hiring in the near term.
1. Government employment fell 22,000 in December because
temporary election workers left payrolls.

The total private workweek dropped 0.3 hour to 34.3 hours in
December, possibly in part because of a storm that hit several
Northeastern states late in the December survey week. As a result,
the index of aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory
workers fell 0.7 percent last month. Despite this drop, the strong
gains in hours in October and November produced the largest
quarterly advance (1.7 percent at an annual rate) since the first
quarter of 1990. In the manufacturing sector, hours edged up
0.4 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, after falling
at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the third quarter.
Employment, as measured by the household survey, rose 247,000
in December, bringing the increase during all of 1992 to about
1.6 million. This contrasts sharply with the gain of only about
600,000 in payroll employment and raises the question of whether the
establishment survey has been understating job and income growth.
The household survey includes employment categories that are not
covered in the establishment survey--namely, self-employed
individuals, unpaid family workers, domestic workers, and those on
unpaid absences. However, as shown in the chart, even when these
categories are removed from household employment, its growth still
exceeded that of payrolls.
The BLS revises the payroll employment series each year by
setting the payroll level in March of the preceding year equal to
the level of employment derived from unemployment insurancerecords;
historically the payroll survey tends to be revised in the direction
of the household survey. Such revisions apparently often reflect
net business formations, which the BLS attempts to capture--albeit
imperfectly--in its bias adjustment to the national monthly
establishment data; thus, one potential explanation of the gap last
year is a failure to adequately account for net business formations

II-6
in the payroll data. This interpretation would lead us to expect
stronger employment and income growth when recent payroll data are
eventually revised. However, through March 1992 at least, the BLS
expects such revisions to be small--less than 100,000--based on
2their reading of the preliminary UI records. And, although
final UI records are not yet available for subsequent months, the
bias adjustment factor, which depends arithmetically on past
revisions and on the recent pace of employment growth, has risen to
50,000 per month. Whether this adjustment has sufficiently
accounted for the net increase in new businesses since the March
1992 benchmark is, for now, difficult to judge. However, separate
data from Dun and Bradstreet suggest that, until last fall, no
pickup in new business formations had occurred.

2. In June of last year, the BLS released its March 1991
benchmark revision, which revised down the level of payroll
employment in March 1991 by 640,000. Recent analysis by the BLS
indicated that about 500,000 of the 640,000 downward revision
resulted from improved reporting procedures and not sampling error.
As a result, when the BLS releases its next benchmark revision, it
will lengthen the time period over which the decline is wedged in--
possibly to as long as a decade. Thus, the data eventually will
show a much smaller drop in employment during the recession than is
currently evident.

II-7
The stronger growth in household employment also has been
accompanied by a pickup in labor supply. The labor force
participation rate edged higher in December to 66.3 percent, and for
1992 as a whole, the labor force grew about 1.9 million--the biggest
increase since 1989. Most of the gain in participation, as in
household employment, occurred among adults. The labor supply of
young adults (ages 20 to 24) and teenagers was little changed over
the year--in the latter case though, a marked contrast to declines
in 1990-91. In addition, the number of discouraged workers edged
lower in the fourth quarter and was about flat for 1992 as a
whole.3
Recent data also point to a decline in the number of workers on
layoff. The number of job losers moved lower in December, and the
number of individuals on permanent layoff has declined gradually in
recent months. In addition, involuntary part-time employment edged
lower in December and over the year was little changed, suggesting
that most of the job growth last year came in full-time employment.
The median duration of unemployment held at 9.4 weeks in December
and stood about 1-1/2 weeks higher at the end of 1992 relative to
December 1991. Such a pattern is typical during the early part of
an employment recovery. As labor demand picks up, the flow into
unemployment slows, raising the share of longer-term unemployed in
total unemployment.
Industrial Production
Activity in the industrial sector continued to improve in the
fourth quarter. In December, industrial production rose
3. As reported recently in the press, the BLS plans to revise the
household survey questionnaire beginning in January 1994. At this
point, how these changes will affect estimates of employment and
unemployment is unclear. BLS is currently testing the new form in
parallel with the current one: The changes will also alter the
definition of part-time workers to include individuals who work more
than 35 hours per week at multiple part-time jobs.

0.3 percent, bringing the fourth-quarter advance to 3.7 percent at
an annual rate versus 2.3 percent in the third quarter. Strong
gains in the production of motor vehicles and parts, business
equipment, and nondurable consumer goods contributed to the year-end
acceleration in IP.
Motor vehicle assemblies rose sharply in the fourth quarter to
a 10.3 million unit pace, from 9.5 million units in the third
quarter. Manufacturers' schedules call for a further big increase
in assemblies during the first quarter of 1993, to an 11.2 million
unit pace. Most of the first-quarter pickup in production is
scheduled to be in automobiles, for which assemblies are slated to
rise from a 5.7 million unit pace in the fourth quarter to a
6.4 million unit rate in the first quarter. Truck assemblies are
scheduled at 4.8 million units this quarter, up from 4.6 million
units in the fourth quarter.

Dealers' inventories of autos and trucks were fairly
comfortable at year-end. Stocks of automobiles were at about a
60 days' supply, while inventories of trucks were a little over
70 days. Unless manufacturers see a pickup in the pace of sales
relative to the fourth quarter--which has not occurred thus far--
they likely will not meet their optimistic first-quarter production

schedules. Production data for the first three weeks of January
indicate that actual assemblies are running only a bit behind the
planned rate, suggesting that what adjustments are necessary will
occur in February and March.
Apart from motor vehicles, industrial production increased
2.8 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, about the same
rate of advance as in the third quarter. Output of business
equipment jumped 7.3 percent (annual rate) in the fourth quarter,
following a gain of 5.8 percent in the third quarter. Computer
output continued to rise rapidly, and production of industrial and
other types of business equipment accelerated. The output of
consumer goods other than motor vehicles edged lower in December.
but buoyed by a sharp gain in October, the quarterly increase
amounted to 3.6 percent at an annual rate.
In contrast, cuts in defense production and the weak demand for
commercial aircraft exerted a significant drag on IP throughout 1992
and likely will continue to do so in 1993. Production of defense
and space equipment, which constituted about 4-1/2 percent of total
IP at the end of 1991, fell nearly 10 percent last year. The direct
effect of this decline was to lower growth of total IP about
1/2 percentage point; indirect effects might have raised the drag
from defense cuts last year to a full percentage point. In
addition, output of commercial aircraft fell more than 5 percent
during 1992, and the production rate for aircraft at Boeing is
scheduled to drop roughly an additional 20 percent by the end of
this year. Currently, commercial aircraft and parts make up about
2 percent of IP, and should Boeing go through with its scheduled
production cuts for 1993, total growth in IP this year would be
directly reduced about 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point.

II-12
Although a continued drag from defense and aircraft seems
likely, other areas of the industrial sector are poised to post
gains in the near term. Real adjusted durable goods orders have
risen steadily in recent months. Moreover, business inventories
appear relatively lean, suggesting that any further strengthening in
final demand should translate relatively quickly into increased
production. Weekly production data for January indicate that
although electricity generation has weakened, coal mining and lumber
production appear to have started the month fairly strongly. Prices
of industrial commodities have firmed in recent weeks, suggesting
that manufacturing activity has been strengthening.

Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending was up sharply on average in the fourth
quarter. Total nominal retail sales rose 1.2 percent in December,
boosted, in part, by strong spending at auto dealers and building
material and supply stores. The retail control component of
spending, which excludes these two components of sales, rose a more
modest 0.4 percent in December, but for the fourth quarter as a
whole, spending at the retail control group of stores advanced
7.0 percent (annual rate) from the previous quarter. Among the
components of control, sales were down last month at general
merchandise and furniture and appliance establishments but were up
smartly in food and in the other durable and nondurable categories.
The decline in sales at general merchandise stores in December
seems at odds with the glowing news reports about the strength of
sales during the holiday season. The contrast may reflect the
tendency of the press--and of businesses--to focus on year-over-year
comparisons rather than monthly growth rates, and sales at these
stores already had risen appreciably in October and in November. On
a year-over-year basis, nominal sales at these stores in December
were up about 10 percent--similar to the increases in department
store and chain store sales that have received the most attention in
the press.
In the motor vehicle sector, sales of North American produced
light vehicles fell to about a 10 million unit annual rate during
the first twenty days of January from an 11 million unit rate in
December. Part of the decline is attributable to a contest between
the Honda Accord and Ford Taurus at year-end, which boosted December
auto sales by an estimated 1/2 million units. In addition, sales of
transplants (other than the Accord) fell, likely hurt by the
expiration early this month of numerous dealer incentive packages.

For 1992 as a whole, lower financing costs and relatively small
price increases helped boost sales of light vehicles (including
imports) to 12.85 million units--1/2 million units above sales in
1991. The sales pace remained well below prerecession levels,
however. Sales of automobiles last year about matched sales in
1991, with stronger sales of North American produced autos
offsetting declines in imports. Sales of light trucks in 1992 were
1/2 million units higher than in 1991, reflecting increases in both
the car-like truck segment (such as minivans and sport-utility
vehicles) and other light trucks.
Growth of personal income also picked up in October and
November, though by less than consumer spending. The monthly
movements were distorted by a variety of special factors, but real
disposable income rose, on balance, at a 3 percent annual rate in
October and November. However, even adjusting for the temporary
impact of a winter storm on earnings during the survey week, data
from the December labor market report suggest that wage and salary
income was little changed for the month, after solid gains in the
prior two months.
Reflecting the recent movements in spending and income growth,
the personal saving rate likely edged down further in the fourth
quarter, after falling 3/4 percentage point in the third quarter.
The drop in the saving rate in the second half of last year comes on
the heels of a prolonged period of cautious spending and a
discernible uptrend in the saving rate from mid-1989 to mid-1992.
The recent decline in the saving rate may be associated, at least
partly, with reductions in household debt service burdens over the
past two years. In addition, consumer sentiment has improved
4. As measured by the CPI, automobile prices increased
2.3 percent in 1992 versus 3.3 percent in 1991. Prices for trucks
rose 2.5 percent in 1992 compared with 3.0 percent in 1991.

sharply since its recent trough in October, according to survey
evidence. Although changes in consumer sentiment typically reflect
recent gains in income and employment, the rise in sentiment since
October seems to exceed the strength posted by these indicators and
evidently reflects to a degree increased optimism about the role of
government economic policy. Greater confidence could, of course,
reduce precautionary saving.
Housing Markets
Housing activity rose further at year-end. Total private
housing starts increased 5.5 percent in December, as single-family
starts jumped to 1.13 million units--the highest level in nearly
three years--and multifamily starts moved above the extraordinarily
low levels of October and November. An even larger increase in
permits helped to restore a typical alignment of starts and permits
and gave added credence to the rise in starts observed in recent
months. For all of 1992, 1.20 million units were started, the
highest level since 1989.
Other indicators of single-family housing generally point to a
strengthening in demand. Sales of existing homes increased
5 percent in December. And, although the preliminary estimate of
new home sales in November showed an 8-1/4 percent decline, the
prevalence of positive revisions to the preliminary estimates of new
home sales throughout 1992 suggests a strong likelihood that the
November figure also will be revised upward. Furthermore,
consumer attitudes toward homebuying and builders' assessments of
new home sales strengthened in November and December, lending
5. From the preliminary estimate to the final estimate, the
average revision for the first eight months of 1992 was almost
38,000 units. Next month, with the release of the December
estimate, Census will implement a new procedure to address the
underestimation problem.

support to the view that housing activity remains on a course of
moderate expansion.
Attitudes of households toward selling a home have been
considerably more downbeat recently compared with their attitudes
toward homebuying. Roughly 80 percent of all households responding
to the Michigan consumer sentiment survey in late 1992 rated
homebuying conditions as good, primarily reflecting low interest
rates and relatively low home prices. However, almost two-thirds of
those homeowners, when asked a set of special questions on selling,
felt that it was a bad time to sell a house, primarily because home
prices were perceived to be too low. Homeowners also frequently
mentioned that they would lose money if they were to sell their
house now, and they expressed concern that many prospective buyers
would not be able to afford a home, even with lower prices. These
contrasting assessments of the conditions for buying and selling
homes are consistent with anecdotal reports that the "trade-up"
portion of the home market continues to be relatively dormant, at
the same time that sales of homes to first-time buyers are brisk.
In the multifamily sector, construction continues to be impeded
by a persistent oversupply of rental apartments and the resulting
restraint on rents. Starts rose in December to an annual rate of
172,000 units, but that increase was from an unusually low level.
Indeed, the average level of multifamily starts in 1992--171,000
units--was the lowest annual figure on record, dating back to 1959.
The vacancy rate for rental apartments edged down to 8.9 percent in
the fourth quarter of 1992 from 9.2 percent during the same period
in the previous year. This suggests a slight reduction in the
overhang of apartment units.

II-23
Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for business fixed investment likely increased
moderately through November, with higher spending on both producers'
durable equipment and nonresidential structures. Moreover, the
available data on capital goods orders appear consistent with a
further rise in investment spending in early 1993.
For equipment, the data point to an increase in spending on all
major categories of capital equipment except aircraft. October and
November shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft
were, on average, 3/4 percent above their third-quarter level (in
nominal terms). As has been the case all year, sales of office and
computing equipment have accounted for much of the increase in
shipments in recent months. However, in contrast to the first three
quarters of 1992, when fierce competition among producers and the
resultant dramatic price declines led to a striking surge in demand,
the real growth rate of these shipments apparently slowed as the
price declines moderated. In addition, industry contacts have
suggested that the fourth-quarter demand for some types of computing
equipment may have been damped by the anticipation of the
introduction of the faster microprocessors in early 1993.6 After
increasing earlier in the year, shipments of equipment excluding
aircraft and computers edged lower in the first two months of the
fourth quarter but still appear to be on an upward trend. Business
purchases of heavy trucks increased 5.8 percent in the fourth
quarter, and automobile and light truck purchases shot up, as end-
of-year price incentives lured business customers into the market.
In contrast, domestic outlays for civil aircraft appear to have
dropped considerably in October and November. Data from the major
6. The gain from waiting may be quite large. PCs based on the
new Pentium chip, for example, are expected to triple the speed of
the current top-of-the-line models and demand only a 50 percent
price premium.

manufacturers suggest that fourth-quarter shipments will be well
below the third-quarter level, with shipments to domestic carriers
hit the hardest. Looking ahead, recent press reports indicate a
further weakening in the aircraft market for 1993 and 1994. For
example. Northwest has delayed taking delivery of several planes
until 1994, and United is in negotiations with Boeing concerning the
deferral of up to 50 planes scheduled for delivery this year. The
recent news of large orders by the leasing group, ILFC, and by the
United Parcel Service, will not alter the bleak outlook for
deliveries over the next two years.
The Commerce Department's fall (October-November) survey of
capital spending plans for 1993 indicates that firms expect to
increase nominal outlays for plant and equipment 5.3 percent this
year. If realized, these plans would represent a moderate
acceleration of spending from the 3.6 percent increase now
anticipated for 1992. The planned increase in expenditure is
widespread, with the notable exception of the aircraft and airline
industries, in which outlays are expected to decline 21 and
11 percent respectively. Past experience suggests that the survey's
results are a noisy indicator of plant and equipment spending, and
actual outlays have fallen short of anticipated levels in each of
the last three years.
Outlays for nonresidential structures, which dropped sharply in
late summer, retraced virtually all of this decline by November.8
7. The survey is designed to be an indicator of plant and
equipment spending. Plant and equipment spending and business fixed
investment are independent measures of investment outlays. Plant
and equipment spending is measured by tracking expenditures, whereas
business fixed investment is calculated by tracking shipments and
construction put-in-place. In the past, the realized values of
these two different measures of investment activity have been very
highly correlated.
8. The regional Dodge contracts data suggest that the 1992
decline was particularly large in California, which accounts for
about 15 percent of total contracts. Through November, cumulative

The average for October and November was about 3 percent above the
third-quarter level. Most of the components of nonresidential
structures were either up or steady in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Office construction, which had declined sharply in the second and
third quarters, held steady through November at its third-quarter
level. Commercial construction other than office buildings
increased 6-1/2 percent in October and November, while "all other"
construction (which includes institutional buildings, hotels,
motels, and miscellaneous construction and makes up about one-
quarter of total construction) was 5-1/2 percent above its third-
quarter level. In addition, drilling and mining activity surged, as
producers raced to qualify for the expiring Section 29 tax credit,
amounting to a $6 per "oil-equivalent" barrel subsidy for natural
gas as well as some types of oil and coal. On the whole, the new
commitments data suggest that outlays for nonresidential
construction (excluding drilling and mining) have hit bottom,
although with little sign of an impending pickup in activity.
Business Inventories
The business inventory situation has not changed materially
since the December Greenbook. Inventory levels have been reported
in the press and elsewhere to range mainly from "lean" to
"satisfactory." with little evidence of excess stocks. For all

offset by a noticeable drawdown in manufacturing stocks.9 The
November inventory accumulation was broadly in line with the
increases in shipments and sales, and the inventory-sales ratio for
all manufacturing and trade was about the same as those observed in
the previous few months.
In manufacturing, strong shipments of durable goods in November
led to widespread inventory reductions, pushing down the inventory-
to-shipments ratios for most durable goods industries. As in recent
months, stocks at aircraft and parts manufacturers contracted,
reflecting the industry's ongoing adjustment to defense cutbacks and
to slackening orders for commercial jets. Stocks of defense capital
goods in general, and at defense aircraft producers in particular,
have trended down since late 1990, and the defense cutbacks are
expected to remain a significant downside factor in manufacturers'
overall inventory investment in the months ahead. Elsewhere in
manufacturing, buildups occurred in November in stocks held by some
materials industries--chemicals, rubber and plastics, and textiles.
However, such buildups appear roughly in line with the general
picture of strengthening demand in the industrial sector, as
indicated both by the increases in non-aircraft orders in the Census
reports since September and by purchasing managers in many regions
of the country.
In the trade sector, non-auto retail inventories continued to
expand in November at about the average pace of the preceding
several months; sales dropped slightly. Although the inventory-
sales ratio edged up as a result, sales subsequently were brisk, and
we have seen few anecdotal reports of inventory overhangs in the
retail sector, either during or after the holiday sales season. For
9. Given the substantial upward revision to the current-cost
estimates of manufacturing and trade inventories in October, it is
likely that stocks will be revised up sharply on a constant-dollar
basis as well, perhaps by as much as $40 billion.

stores in the GAF grouping in particular, Census data show that the
inventory-sales ratio remained close to trend despite a small uptick
in November. In the wholesale sector, sizable inventory increases
were reported in October and November, but the buildups were limited
to only a few categories--machinery, motor vehicles, and some
miscellaneous nondurable goods. With the increases in wholesale
shipments since September, the wholesalers' inventory-sales ratio
stood at 1.34 months at the end of November, still below its recent
peak of 1.37 months observed in December of 1991.
Federal Sector
The federal government's unified budget deficit for the fourth
calendar quarter of 1992 totaled $120 billion, $37 billion above the
year-earlier level. About two-thirds of the increase was
attributable to the advance into December of $24 billion of Social
Security disbursements because the normal January payment date fell
on a holiday. Excluding this timing shift, as well as swings in
expenditures for deposit insurance and financial contributions for
Operation Desert Storm, outlays were up about 6 percent from a year
earlier.
Meanwhile, receipts rose 4 percent over this period. Withheld
income taxes continued to be damped by the change in withholding
schedules last March; adjusting for this rule change, they were up
10 percent over the year, compared with an estimated increase in
wages and salaries of about 4 percent. The rapid growth in
withholdings may reflect, in part, the shifting of income by
taxpayers into 1992 in anticipation of higher marginal tax rates
under the new Administration. Such income shifting also may have
contributed to the surge in nonwithheld collections around
January 15, which was the final due date for the payment of 1992
quarterly estimated taxes; daily data indicate that these

II-34
collections were about $10 billion above year-earlier levels.
However, estimated tax payments also were strong throughout 1992, in
part because of tighter "safe harbor" rules that require taxpayers
to meet a higher portion of their tax liabilities through withheld
or estimated tax payments--and perhaps greater realizations of
capital gains. Tighter "safe harbor" rules for corporations, as
well as strong corporate profits, helped to lift corporate tax
payments in the fall quarter about 12 percent above the level of
late 1991.
The changes in tax provisions will continue to affect the
pattern of receipts in 1993. In particular, the reduction in
withholding rates that took effect last March lowered withholdings
about $20 billion in calendar 1992; because it had no effect on
liabilities, final settlements in the first half of 1993 likely will
be higher by a comparable amount, with both lower refunds and higher
final payments.
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under President
Bush, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have released new
baseline budget projections for the next five years. Through
FY1995, these projections assume that the caps on discretionary
spending established by OBRA in 1990 are adhered to, and that there
will be no changes, on net, in the laws governing mandatory spending
and taxes. Both agencies anticipate little change in the deficit
over this period. Excluding deposit insurance, the deficit is
projected to edge up from $288 billion in FY1992 to the area of
$310 billion in FY1993 and to fall only slightly over the next two
years. (The OMB and CBO projections for FY1995 are $280 billion and
$273 billion respectively.) In both projections, the deficit is
narrowed by the projected pickup in economic activity. The
reductions in real discretionary spending (of roughly 7 percent

II-35
between 1993 and 1995) required to meet the OBRA caps also help to
lower the deficit over this period, but these savings are largely
offset by a continued surge in outlays for health care. Outlays for
deposit insurance are not expected to have substantial effects on
the deficit over the next five years; both OMB and CBO expect such
spending to add to the deficit, on net, over the next few years, but
to help to reduce it thereafter.
After FY1995, when OBRA expires, the OMB and CBO budget
projections diverge, primarily because of differences in how the
agencies define their baselines for discretionary spending. The OMB
projection, which holds discretionary spending constant in nominal
terms, shows the deficit (excluding deposit insurance) widening to
$327 billion in FY1998. Meanwhile, the CBO projection, which allows
discretionary spending to grow at the rate of inflation, shows a
deficit of $367 billion (excluding deposit insurance) in that year.
According to CBO, the difference in baseline concepts is worth
$50 billion in FY1998.
With respect to the economic assumptions that underlie the
budget estimates, both agencies expect real GDP growth to be about
3 percent in both 1993 and 1994.10 The projected growth paths
differ somewhat in subsequent years, but the differences are
essentially offsetting, and, by 1998, the levels of both real GDP
and the unemployment rate are essentially the same in the two
forecasts. CBO's inflation forecast is lower than OMB's, as is its
forecast for long-term interest rates. By the late 1990s, CBO's
10. In contrast to normal practice, OMB based its budget estimates
on the economic forecasts of the "Blue Chip consensus" of private
forecasters. An extension of the November Blue Chip forecast with
the Blue Chip's October long-run forecast shows somewhat slower
real growth and faster inflation over the next five years than what
the Bush Administration considered "the most likely outcome." All
else equal, under the Bush Administration's preferred forecast, the
deficit would fall to $265 billion in FY1995 and change relatively
little thereafter.

short-term interest rates are only a little lower than OMB's, and
thus somewhat higher in real terms. All told, however, the
differences in economic assumptions are not large enough to have a
significant effect on the budget outlook.
Reportedly, the Clinton Administration plans to release its
economic proposals in February and a budget by mid-March. Current
indications are that the Administration is considering a small
stimulus package (on the order of $20 billion) as well as a longer-
term deficit-reduction package that would include both restraints on
expenditure growth and additions to revenues.
State and Local Government Sector
Recent data on the state and local sector point toward sluggish
growth in purchases of goods and services during the fourth quarter.
According to the initial estimate (which often revises appreciably),
real construction put-in-place jumped 3 percent in November
following a decline the month before; on net, the October-November
average was 0.2 percent above the third-quarter level. Employment
by state and local governments, which had been boosted in November
by the hiring of temporary election workers, dropped back in
December. Over the fourth quarter as a whole, state and local
employment rose 37,000, a bit slower than the pace recorded in
previous quarters.
A recent survey by the National Conference of State
Legislatures (NCSL) provides new information on the austere budgets
enacted by many states for fiscal 1993. According to the NCSL,
general fund spending is expected to increase only 3 percent in
nominal terms in FY1993, after rising 5.3 percent in FY1992. Among
the components of spending, outlays for higher education are
expected to fall slightly, while planned increases in outlays for
primary education and corrections are well below the increases of

II-39
the previous fiscal year. In addition, Medicaid expenditures are
projected to rise only 6 percent this fiscal year, after a
29 percent increase in FY1992.
The limited information on the states' general funds, which
account for only about half of states' expenditures, indicate that
revenue collections so far in FY1993 are at or above expectations
but that spending is exceeding plans. In particular, states'
expenditures on Medicaid appear to be running higher than
anticipated, while outlays for primary education and corrections are
overbudget in some states. However, many states are acting quickly
to make midyear budget cuts. And two states, Arkansas and Ohio,
enacted significant tax increases in December.
Labor Costs
Although the progress was uneven over the year, hourly wage and
benefit costs, on balance, decelerated further in 1992. In the
fourth quarter, hourly compensation of private industry workers, as
measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI), rose 3.5 percent at an
annual rate, a bit more than in the previous two quarters. However,
some part of that acceleration appears to reflect a rebound in
compensation paid to sales workers. Commission earnings account for
a large portion of the pay of sales workers, and a pickup in these
earnings, which had languished with the sluggish pace of spending in
earlier quarters, is consistent with the apparent strength of final
demand in the fourth quarter. Over the twelve months of 1992, the
ECI rose 3.5 percent--almost a full percentage point less than the
increase recorded in 1991.
The slowing in labor costs last year came in both the wages and
benefits components. The index for wages and salaries rose
2.6 percent over the 12 months of 1992, about 1 percentage point
less than in 1991. Growth in benefits slowed from more than

6 percent in 1991 to just over 5 percent in 1992. Much of the
deceleration in the benefit component was in health insurance costs:
Smaller increases in medical services prices and efforts by
employers to shift more of the burden of medical care costs to
employees combined to hold the 1992 increase in employer costs to
8.6 percent, the lowest since 1987. In addition, employer costs for
pensions slowed last year, likely reflecting increases in the market
value of defined benefit plans.
By occupation, compensation growth of white-collar workers
slowed 1-1/4 percentage points in 1992 to 3.3 percent. The
deceleration was especially sharp in the executive, administrative,
and managerial occupations; compensation rose just 2 percent in
these occupations--more than 2-1/2 percentage points below the gain
in 1991. In blue-collar occupations, hourly compensation rose
3.6 percent in 1992 after a gain of 4.3 percent in 1991. The
deceleration in compensation growth last year for blue-collar
occupations was more evenly spread, with compensation slowing
between 1/2 and 1 percentage point across most occupations.

1991. Employers in retail trade, and in finance, insurance, and
real estate (FIRE) reported the largest decelerations over the year.
In retail trade, considerable weakness at general merchandise stores
held compensation gains to 2.6 percent in 1992--more than
1-1/2 percentage point below the increase in 1991. Compensation in
FIRE rose just 1.2 percent in 1992 compared with an increase of
4.3 percent in 1991. Much of the slowing in FIRE was in the real
estate sector, although compensation gains were down as well in the
insurance industry. In contrast, compensation gains in the
financial industry accelerated last year to 3.7 percent from
1.5 percent during 1991, as the improvement in financial profits
apparently fed through into higher employee compensation. In the
goods-producing sector, compensation rose 3.8 percent in 1992
compared with an increase of 4.6 percent in 1991. In manufacturing,
compensation slowed almost 1 percentage point to 3.8 percent in
1992, while hourly compensation in construction slowed more than

above 4 percent in 1992. The smaller deceleration in union wages is
generally consistent with separate data on major collective
bargaining settlements.11 Although first-year wage adjustments
were down from 1991, the average wage gain over the life of the
contract in 1992 was the same as the average wage change in the
contracts that they replaced. A similar pattern is evident for
compensation costs in contracts covering 5.000 or more workers.
These data indicate that first-year wage adjustments in contracts
negotiated in 1992 averaged 3.3 percent--down from 4.1 percent in
1991. However, the average compensation cost increase over the life
of the contract stood at 3.3 percent in 1992, only a bit below the
average for contracts negotiated in 1991.
Including pay increases from earlier settlements and COLAs, the
average wage rate change for workers covered by major collective
bargaining contracts was 3.1 percent in 1992, versus 3.6 percent in
1991. Most of the slowing in the average wage change last year came
from current settlements. The contribution from prior settlements
was unchanged, while the contribution from COLA provisions edged
lower over the year.

2.2 percent--almost a full percentage point below the reading of a

Prices
On balance, 1992 ended with good news on price inflation. In
December, both the overall CPI and the index excluding food and
energy rose just 0.1 percent, after somewhat larger increases in the
preceding months. Over the twelve months of 1992, the CPI increased
2.9 percent, a bit less than in 1991. For the index excluding food
and energy, the deceleration was more marked, with prices up just
3.3 percent, down from a 4.4 percent increase in 1991. Last year's
increase in the CPI excluding food and energy was the smallest since
wage and price controls were in effect in the early 1970s.
Energy prices fell at all levels in December. The price of
crude petroleum fell 8 percent, the second consecutive decline of
that magnitude. In addition, spot prices for natural gas, which had
jumped in the weeks immediately following Hurricane Andrew, have
since returned to pre-hurricane levels. The declines in crude oil
and natural gas at the end of the year were reflected at the
consumer level, as gasoline prices fell 0.9 percent in the CPI, and
natural gas prices declined 1-3/4 percent, reversing about half
their November increases. Based on survey information, consumer
gasoline prices rose about 0.4 percent in January. Food prices rose
0.2 percent at the consumer level in December after no change in
October and November. The volatile fruit and vegetable category
moved up 1 percent last month; elsewhere, prices were about flat on
net.
In December, the CPI for commodities excluding food and energy
fell 0.2 percent. Some of the decline may have reflected holiday
discounting: For example, apparel prices fell 0.9 percent; prices
of VCRs, toys, and sporting goods also were down. To the extent

that such earlier-than-normal discounting was important, prices for
these goods may rebound somewhat in the January and February
reports, especially if the December sales were successful in moving
holiday merchandise. A similar effect may be at work in the market
for new motor vehicles, where prices fell in December but may have
rebounded at the turn of the year when incentive programs on some
popular models ended. In addition, Ford recently announced price
increases of 1 percent on 1993 model cars. Elsewhere, prices of
nonenergy services rose 0.3 percent, about in line with their
average increase in 1992.
Looking at 1992 as a whole, developments in oil and
agricultural markets obscured somewhat the overall deceleration in
the CPI. While energy prices in the CPI rose only 2 percent over
the twelve months of 1992, this marked an acceleration from 1991.
when energy prices fell 7-1/2 percent in the aftermath of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. Food prices in the CPI rose 1-1/2 percent in
1992, 1/2 percentage point less than in 1991. At the wholesale
level, food prices were also up 1-1/2 percent, but this marked an
acceleration from a 1-1/2 percent decline in 1991. A major factor
in this acceleration was prices of meats and poultry, which had
declined in 1991 but rose 2.3 percent in 1992. Indeed, in other
categories at the consumer level, deceleration in food prices last
year was in line with that for nonfood, nonenergy items.
The indexes for goods and services contributed about equally to
1992's deceleration in the CPI excluding food and energy. Prices of
commodities other than food and energy decelerated 1-1/2 percentage
points to post a 2-1/2 percent increase. While weak demand and
declining labor costs likely played a role in this easing, part of
the deceleration reflected sales and other excise taxes, which were
raised more in 1991 than in 1992. This was especially notable in

II-50
the indexes for tobacco and alcoholic beverages, where federal
excise taxes were raised significantly at the beginning of 1991 as
part of the 1990 budget accord. Increases in nonenergy services
prices continued to slow in 1992, with the deceleration widespread
across categories. In particular, owners' equivalent rents rose
only 3 percent last year. 3/4 of a percentage point less than in
1991. Medical service fees decelerated 1 percentage point, posting
a 7.0 percent increase in 1992.
Factors influencing inflation remained mostly favorable to
continued disinflation at the end of 1992. Upward pressures on
import prices have been mitigated by the strength of the dollar and
weakness in economic activity abroad. Moreover, capacity
utilization in December was only 78.4 percent, well below the level
at which industrial capacity constraints have become important in
the past. Economywide slack also was large, with output
considerably below the staff's estimate of potential in the third
quarter of 1992. And, with the unemployment rate still relatively
high, labor cost increases continued to slow through the end of
1992.
Inflation expectations also eased a bit over the past year. In
the preliminary Michigan survey of consumer expectations for
January, the mean expected price rise for the next twelve months was
3-1/4 percent, about 1/4 percentage point lower than a year earlier.
However, this measure can be erratic from month to month; only two
months before, for example, the reading was 4-1/2 percent. A more
stable (though historically downward-biased) indicator is the median
of consumers' expectations; according to this measure, consumers are
expecting inflation at 3 percent in 1993, compared with over
4 percent a year ago.

II-51
Producer prices of finished goods rose 0.2 percent in December,
reversing a decline in November. Excluding food and energy,
finished goods prices rose 0.3 percent in December after six months
of no change on net. Increases for cars, light trucks, and tobacco
were large in December, but no one category was responsible for the
pickup. For 1992 as a whole, the PPI for finished goods rose
1.6 percent after little change in 1991. However, the acceleration
last year was entirely the result of the food and energy price
factors mentioned earlier, and increases in the index for finished
goods other than food and energy slowed from 3.1 percent in 1991 to
1.9 percent last year.
Consistent with the ongoing recovery in the industrial sector,
many measures of commodity prices have moved up in recent weeks.
The Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials prices has
risen 2-3/4 percent since the December Greenbook. The spot
price of steel scrap jumped early this year, and prices of a variety
of other industrial metals have been tilting up since late autumn.
Also, lumber prices have continued to soar in the spot markets,
rising nearly 25 percent since mid-December. This price surge
apparently is a reflection both of increased housing construction
and weather-related supply disruptions in some regions, in the
context of adjustment to environmental restrictions on logging in
some areas. Futures prices for lumber currently follow a sharply
declining trajectory over the next year, suggesting that traders
think that at least some of the factors pushing prices up currently
will prove to be transitory in nature.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have declined across the maturity spectrum since
the December FOMC meeting, with most short-term market interest
rates down about 25 basis points and bond rates down less. The
federal funds rate has continued to fluctuate around 3 percent, and
other short rates now appear to have returned to a more normal
alignment with the funds rate, perhaps because of the passage of
year-end pressures and a growing sense that inflationary forces are
sufficiently subdued that Fed tightening actions may be well down
the road. Both Treasury and corporate bond rates were up about
20 basis points in mid-January, in reaction to reports that the 1993
federal deficit would likely be larger than previously forecast.
Subsequent discussion of deficit reduction plans and of a possible
shift in Treasury issuance toward shorter maturities helped roll
back those increases, and late in the period yields dropped below
their mid-December levels. Stock price movements have been mixed;
the NASDAQ index has continued to post new highs, bolstered by the
performance of high-technology and computer-related firms, while the
Dow-Jones Industrial stock index is down slightly on balance, owing
mainly to the troubles of IBM and a few other major companies.
Businesses paid down bank loans and commercial paper in
December while stepping up their public bond offerings. Thus far in
January, they have continued to concentrate borrowing in the
long-term sector, as bond issuance has strengthened further and bank
loans and commercial paper have stabilized on balance. Partial data
for the household sector indicate that growth in home mortgage debt,
boosted by a heavy volume of refinancings, rebounded in the final
quarter of the year. An upturn in credit card use in December
likely helped lift consumer installment debt to its first quarterly
gain in a year. Consumer loans at banks continued to expand in

early January and home mortgage applications have increased after a
lull late in 1992.
The strengthening of monetary growth during the fall faded in
December, as growth in M1 slowed to a single-digit pace and the
broader aggregates registered declines. M2 contracted at an annual
rate of about 1/2 percent and M3 fell at a 3-1/4 percent rate,
leaving both of the broader aggregates below the lower bounds of
their 1992 target ranges. The velocities of these aggregates are
estimated to have increased substantially further in the fourth
quarter. Preliminary data for January suggest continued growth in
Ml at about the December pace but further declines in M2 and M3.
Some of the recent weakening in money growth reflects the ebbing of
special factors, such as mortgage refinancing, that had spurred
growth earlier. But the underlying growth also is sluggish, and the
forces raising velocity continue to influence broad money growth.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit1
The slower growth of Ml in December resulted from a sharp
deceleration in OCDs and demand deposits. OCD growth had surged to
25 percent in November, as completed the dismantling of
its sweep account program and reclassification of account balances
from large time deposits to OCDs, but fell back to an 11-1/4 percent
rate in December. Growth in demand deposits dwindled to 5 percent,
less than half the November rate, partly because a diminishing
volume of home mortgage refinancing required less temporary parking
of escrowed funds in demand deposits. In contrast, currency growth
picked up in December, apparently in part as a result of increased
shipments abroad.

The nontransactions component of M2 declined at a 4-1/2 percent
annual rate in December, a bit faster than in the previous month.
Small time deposits continued to run off rapidly, and growth in
savings accounts (including money market deposit accounts) slowed
appreciably. Retail money market mutual funds experienced a larger
outflow in December. Increased opportunity costs may have
contributed to the reduced growth in savings deposits (and also in
OCDs), as depositories did not raise interest rates on these
deposits when short-term rates moved up in October and November.
Stock and bond mutual funds continued to attract a large volume of
funds, although anecdotal reports suggest that inflows in December
may have slowed somewhat from November's near-record pace. Over the
four quarters of 1992, M2 grew by nearly 2 percent, dropping about
3/4 percentage point below the lower bound of its target range by
December. Using the current staff estimate for fourth-quarter GDP,
the velocity of M2 rose at about a 3-1/2 percent annual pace both in
the fourth quarter of 1992 and for the year as a whole.
The decline in M3 in December reflected, in addition to the
weakness in M2, continued sizable runoffs in large time deposits and
institution-only money market funds. For the full year 1992.
M3 increased only 1/2 percent, and by December it was 3/4 percentage
point below the lower bound of its target range. M3 velocity is
estimated to have increased last year by about 5 percent, the
largest annual increment since 1969. Bank and thrift credit were
weak; moreover, a substantial proportion of credit was financed by
additions to depository capital accounts.
Bank credit slowed somewhat in December, to an annual rate of
3-3/4 percent, as growth in both loans and securities holdings edged
down. Real estate loans eked out a slight gain. Consumer loans
posted a small increase, the first since June, as reportedly heavy

III-6
credit card use outweighed a relatively strong pace of
securitizations; adjusted for securitizations, consumer loans grew
at a 6-1/2 percent rate, the largest gain in eighteen months.
Business loans contracted at a 5-1/4 percent rate, following a surge
in November that owed partly to drawdowns on a line of credit by a
single firm that needed to replace its commercial paper funding.
The December dropoff may have reflected in part a smaller need to
finance retail inventories than in other recent years because of the
reportedly stronger than expected retail sales volume during the
holiday season. Partial data for early January suggest that the
fourth-quarter trend toward positive but modest increases in bank
lending continued into the new year. The survey of senior loan
officers taken in the latter part of January indicated no change in
underwriting standards or terms on loans to businesses of various
size which, given the historical bias of the survey against
indicating ease, may suggest a tilt toward some loosening of credit
availability for businesses. No change in standards was reported
for commercial real estate loans, and a few banks indicated greater
willingness to make consumer loans.
The moderate upturn in bank lending during the fourth quarter
was fairly widespread geographically (table). Loans continued to
contract in the West, but at a reduced rate. Consumer -loans were
the weakest category in the West. The greatest strength was in the
Central region, particularly in real estate loans, reflecting steady
growth in the Dallas district and a surge in lending in the Kansas
City district. A jump in business lending accounted for much of the
rebound in the Southeast.

Business Finance
Net borrowing by nonfinancial firms remained subdued in
December; data through mid-January, however, suggest some pickup
early this year. Gross public bond issuance rebounded in December
from its slow November pace as businesses took advantage of a sharp
drop in bond rates mainly to refinance outstanding debt. In
contrast, both nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding and
business loans at banks contracted. December reports are not yet
available for business loans at finance companies, which were about
flat on balance during October and November.
Year-end pressures in short-term credit markets appeared sooner
and peaked earlier in 1992 than in either of the previous two years;
by late December, they had all but disappeared. To minimize
potential liquidity problems, many firms had satisfied their funding
needs by late November, particularly Japanese banks and commercial
paper issuers. The premium paid by paper issuers to finance into
the new year declined throughout December after peaking in the first
week of the month. Although the spread between rates on medium- and
top-grade commercial paper remained high until the first full week
of January, it stayed well below the levels of 1990 and 1991. Both

GMAC successfully tapped the paper market for year-end funds,
although their paper trades at rates 30 basis points or so higher
than that of other medium-grade issuers.
Among nonfinancial firms, public offerings of both investment-
grade and junk bonds increased in December. Investment-grade
offerings climbed to about $7 billion in December, still well below
the monthly average pace of $10 billion for the full year, and
appear to have increased substantially further in January. Despite
some widening of rate spreads in the junk bond arena, particularly
for lower-rated firms, junk issuance doubled to about $3 billion in
December and already has surpassed that pace in January. Several
lower-rated firms issued debt with equity-like kickers, such as
Levitz Furniture's zero-coupon issue with warrants to acquire senior
deferred-coupon debentures.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms surged in December
to more than $4 billion, its highest level since June; issuance in
January is expected to be about half of that level. In a rush to
complete deals before year-end and to take advantage of improved
share price performance in the aftermarket, a large number of
smaller-capitalization firms came to the market with initial public
offerings in December. As a result, the volume of IPOs by
nonfinancial firms rebounded to the pace of the first half of 1992.
The IPO calendar still remains long and includes some relatively
large issues. A planned offering by WordPerfect would be the
largest software IPO since Microsoft went public seven years ago.
Stock price movements have been mixed since the last FOMC
meeting. The NASDAQ, powered by high-technology stocks, almost
daily recorded new highs and rose about 7 percent over the
intermeeting period. Shares of smaller-capitalization firms 'that
typically trade in the over-the-counter market have benefitted from

III-10
speculation that the Clinton administration will adopt programs
favorable to smaller firms, especially those in high-tech
industries. Announcements of stronger-than-anticipated
fourth-quarter earnings of several major semiconductor and software
companies also fueled the latest surge in the index. In contrast,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock
Index both dipped slightly. The DJIA has been restrained partly
because of investor concern about IBM: Since the FOMC meeting, the
price of IBM stock has declined over 5 percent.
Bank share prices have climbed sharply on favorable earnings
announcements by several major regional and money center banks. In
1992, banking organizations took the opportunity afforded by higher
prices for their securities to issue record levels of debt and
equity. Banking firms strengthened capital ratios with new issues
of subordinated debt last year exceeding $12 billion, more than
doubling the previous record amount of 1991. Banking organizations
also issued nearly $10 billion in new equity during 1992. In the
opening weeks of 1993, they issued about $3-1/2 billion in total of
debt and equity securities. An overwhelming majority of banks
reporting on the January senior loan officer opinion survey
indicated that their capital positions could be characterized as
comfortable.
Recent indicators of financial stress generally point to
continued improvement in the condition of businesses. Defaults on
corporate bonds in 1992 registered a substantial decline from levels
of the previous two years. Positive dividend actions also increased
in 1992, reflecting stronger profits and improved cash flows.
Although the number of business bankruptcy filings remained at high
levels throughout 1992, the number of ratings downgrades declined

III-11
appreciably. Firms downgraded, however, included a number of large,
well-known corporations.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that a $76 billion first quarter deficit
will be financed by $74 billion of marketable borrowing, with
financing concentrated in February and March. A large cash
management bill is expected to cover a seasonal low in the cash
balance between early March and mid-April.
The Treasury recently announced that, for the second time since
the early 1960s, it will call an outstanding bond issue, one with
five years remaining to maturity. By replacing the security with a
new five-year issue, the Treasury will be able to save about
120 basis points at current interest rates. However, only about
$500 million of the issue is held by nongovernmental investors, so
the budgetary impact will be small. Possible future calls would
have little effect on Treasury borrowing costs, as callable issues
are a miniscule proportion of outstanding bonds, and have not been
issued since 1985.
More dramatic action on debt management may be in store:
Attention within the Administration and Congress has been given to
recommendations that the Treasury shorten the average maturity of
the government's debt, on grounds that this would substantially
lower Treasury borrowing costs and would also reduce long-term
interest rates. This argument hinges on the existence of a
significant and persistent term premium that causes long-term rates
to exceed future short rates. However, evidence on the term premium
is decidedly mixed, and other work suggests that shifts in Treasury
bond auction sizes have only modest effects on long-term Treasury
rates.

Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds surged in December,
spurred mainly by a spike in refunding activity. For the entire
year, total long-term issuance topped $215 billion, a volume
somewhat larger than the previous record set in 1985, when issuers
sold debt in advance of restrictions to be imposed by the 1986 Tax
Reform Act. The pace of refunding has dropped off in January, but
the forward calendar has begun to build, as municipal yields remain
at levels that make large portions of debt sold between 1988 and
1991 attractive for refinancing. Despite the large volume of
refunding offerings in recent months, at least two-thirds of
eligible debt has yet to be refunded. Market analysts suggest that
these refundings will take place whenever demand is sufficient to
accommodate sales without spurring sharp increases in yields.
Favorable demand conditions are likely to exist in the current
quarter, as managers of tax-exempt bond funds will probably attempt
to keep heavy seasonal cash inflows fully invested.

Changes in municipal bond ratings in 1992 suggest that credit
quality in the sector declined somewhat over the year. Although
Moody's raised a few more ratings than it lowered, the dollar volume
of debt downgraded by Moody's was twice the volume of upgraded debt,
a disparity reflecting in part two separate downgradings of
California debt during the year. Ratings changes at Standard &
Poor's have a similar pattern. The majority of both credit
agencies' downgrades consisted of general obligation issuers facing
weak tax revenues; many issuers began fiscal 1993 with their lowest
cash balances in several decades. Nevertheless, analysts at the two
credit agencies believe that credit quality likely will improve on
balance during 1993, partly because tax collections are expected to
improve for many issuers; several states in the Northeast have
already reported significant increases in income tax receipts. In
addition, issuers that refinanced in 1992 are likely to benefit from
lower debt service payments.
Mortgage Markets
Data on recent mortgage credit growth are sparse. Total real
estate loans at commercial banks posted their strongest quarterly
gain of the past year in the fourth quarter, although the monthly
growth rates slowed sharply after a spike in October; early data for
January suggest an overall decline, some of which may be due to
write-downs of real estate loans near year-end. On the other hand,
the Mortgage Bankers Association's index of mortgage applications to
purchase new homes has risen in the three most recent survey weeks
through January 15 (chart). The MBA's index for mortgage
refinancing applications has also picked up a bit. Applications for
both purposes may have been responding to recent declines in
mortgage rates; over the intermeeting period, rates for both

III-16
adjustable-rate mortgages and conventional 30-year fixed-rate
mortgages have dropped about 20 basis points.2
Mortgage yield spreads have continued to narrow from their
widest points reached last fall when mortgage prepayment rates on
even low coupon mortgages increased to unanticipated levels and
market volatility rose to the highest levels of the year. Investor
anxiety about uncertain prepayment rates has calmed in recent weeks,
as prepayment rates appear to have peaked in November and as most
mortgage market analysts have been predicting slower prepayment
rates in the months ahead, on the assumption that mortgage rates
will not decline significantly further.
Despite a relatively weak housing market, residential mortgage
originations in 1992. fueled by heavy refinancing activity, are
reported to have reached a new high of nearly $800 billion (table).
As the thrift industry continued to contract, an increasing share of
mortgage originations were associated with issuance of mortgage-
backed pass-through securities, which rose more than 70 percent to a
record volume of $545 billion.
The private (non-agency) sector of the mortgage securities
market issued a record $90 billion in 1992. Private securities
generally are collateralized by higher-yielding nonconforming
mortgages that are not eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac. These securities receive their credit enhancement in
the form of letters of credit, private mortgage pool insurance, cash
reserve accounts, or various forms of senior/subordinated
2. While MBA staff assume that mortgage refinancings exhibit
little or no seasonal variation, they do seasonally adjust
indirectly the purchase index based on averages of seasonal factors
for new and existing home sales and mortgage originations.
Nevertheless, the sharp declines and abrupt increases in the
purchase index immediately before and after the end of the year for
each of the past three years suggests that at least some of the
seasonal variation in the data has not been adequately captured by
the MBA's subjective procedures.

structures. Prudential Home Mortgage Securities Corporation edged
out the Resolution Trust Corporation to become the largest issuer of
non-agency mortgage securities in 1992, accounting for nearly
20 percent of private issues.
In the derivative market, new-issue Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) increased 43 percent in
1992 to just under $280 billion, but fell short of the levels that
had been expected earlier in-the year. CMO issuance in 1992 began
at the brisk pace set in 1991, but slowed later in the year as
demand softened. The unanticipated surge in prepayments was larger
for a number of planned amortization class (PAC) bonds than allowed
for in their conditional guarantees of cash flow; many investors
thus received larger-than-expected principal repayments which could
only be reinvested at lower rates. Investors' frustration over
these broken PAC bonds resulted in reduced liquidity in the CMO
market and a clear preference for regular pass-throughs in the
second half of the year.

Consumer Installment Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding apparently grew in the
fourth quarter, for only the second time in eight quarters.
Although December figures are not final, mainly because reports from
finance companies are not yet in, a modest pickup in revolving
credit in December may have lifted total installment credit to its
largest monthly increase in more than two years. Revolving
credit--primarily credit card debt--increased at a rate of around
5 percent in December. Even if finance company loans to
consumers did not grow at all, total installment credit would have
risen at about a 4 percent annual rate in December, and at a
2 percent rate for the quarter.
Conversations with credit executives at major retailers
revealed diverse experience on the proportion of their holiday sales
financed by credit. At Penney's, for instance, sales volume was
described as very strong, particularly after mid-December, but
charge card use was about flat. Some Penney's customers had paid
down outstanding balances from the proceeds of mortgage refinancings
in recent months, and were paying off new charges within the billing
period rather than rolling over balances. In contrast, a Sears
executive said that credit sales at that firm were the best since
1988, and that the proportion of credit sales to total sales
increased during the year.
Collection experience was generally quite good at these firms
in the fourth quarter. Bankruptcies, chargeoffs for bad debt, and
delinquency rates all dropped substantially at Penney's over the
3. The growth for revolving credit that will be published in the
Board's consumer credit release in early February will be about
1-1/2 percent, rather than the 5 percent rate cited here. The
discrepancy results from a transfer of $800 million of credit card
receivables from a bank to a finance company. Finance companies do
not report revolving credit as a separate category, but include it
within the "other" component.

III-20
second half of the year, particularly during the fourth quarter.
Delinquency rates and chargeoffs at Sears were higher in December
than a year earlier, but the trend from month to month recently has
been down. Aggregate statistics on delinquency rates and
bankruptcies for the fourth quarter will not be available for
several weeks. Most delinquency series moved lower on balance over
the first three quarters; a flattening out of bankruptcy increases
during the second and third quarters suggests that the rise in that
measure will probably drop below a double-digit pace for the year
for the first time since 1984.

Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened slightly in November
to $7.6 billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis) from a revised
October deficit of $7.2 billion. Exports declined 3 percent and
imports declined 2 percent. For both exports and imports, increases
in automotive products were more than offset by declines in most
other items. The increase in automotive exports was largely parts
shipped to Mexico; the increase in automotive imports was largely
passenger cars from countries other than Mexico or Canada. A 7
percent decline in the value of imported oil resulted from decreases
in both quantity and price. Data for December will be released
February 18.

For October-November combined, the trade deficit at an annual
rate was slightly less than in the third quarter. Nonetheless, for
the last three quarters of 1992, the merchandise trade deficit is
estimated to have averaged $103 billion at an annual rate on a
balance-of-payments basis; this compares with an average of $73
billion at an annual rate for the preceding five quarters. While
exports rose substantially faster than imports in October-November.

IV-3
over the four quarters of 1992 imports are estimated to have grown
about 5 percentage points faster than exports.
Most of the increase in exports in October-November was in
capital goods (both machinery and aircraft) and consumer goods. The
rise in machinery exports was strongest in high tech equipment,
especially telecommunications equipment (boosted by a satellite
launched for foreign owners), semiconductors, and computers. There
was also a jump in gold exports that was largely offset by an
increase in gold imports on a BOP basis; these movements may have
reflected shifts in gold holdings out of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York which were subsequently exported. [When gold leaves the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York it is recorded as an "import" into
the United States on a BOP-basis: when it leaves the country it is
recorded as an export.] By area, the increase in nonagricultural
exports in October-November went primarily to developing countries
(particularly Taiwan and China) as well as to certain industrial
countries, including the United Kingdom (from a low third-quarter
level) and Canada. Overall, the value of nonagricultural exports
grew an estimated 5 percent during 1992 (Q4/Q4), somewhat less than
in 1991.
The value of agricultural exports was about the same in
October-November as in the third quarter as declines in a wide range
of commodities such as soybeans, tobacco, and cotton were offset by
increases in wheat, corn, dairy products, and other agricultural
industrial supplies. For the year as a whole, agricultural exports
grew an estimated 8 percent (Q4/Q4).
A substantial part of the rise in imports in October-November
from the third quarter was in passenger cars from Asia and Europe
that increased from lows recorded during the summer. Imports of
consumer goods eased back a bit in both October and November from

IV-4
the very strong pace recorded in September. While imports of
machinery in October-November were only slightly higher than in the
third quarter, the cumulative rise over the four quarters of 1992
was substantial for key categories: computers, accessories and parts
rose 27 percent, and semiconductors increased 19 percent. In all,
the value of non-oil imports grew an estimated 9 percent in 1992
(Q4/Q4), more than twice the pace recorded in 1991.
Oil Imports
The value of oil imports fell in November; the price of oil
declined by about 40 cents per barrel and the quantity imported
declined 0.4 mb/d from the October average. For October-November
combined, the quantity of oil imports for the third quarter was 0.2
mb/d above the third-quarter rate, largely the result of increased
consumption. For 1992 as a whole, oil imports averaged 8.1 mb/d.
approximately 0.4 mb/d above the average for 1991. The increase in
imports largely reflected increased oil consumption brought about by
the pickup in economic activity. Prices of oil imports increased
over most of 1992, recovering from the trough in the first quarter.

At the beginning of 1993, the oil market continues to remain
relatively oversupplied from strong OPEC production, a surge in
Russian net exports, and gains in North Sea production. At the turn
of the year, spot prices resumed their decline begun in mid-October
of 1992 before rallying this week on calls for production restraint

by Saudi Arabia and Iran. Spot West Texas Intermediate currently
stands at $19.61 per barrel. Because of shipping and contract lags,
import prices should continue to fall at least through January, with
January's import unit value likely to be below $16.00 per barrel.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
In November, prices of non-oil imports declined 0.4 percent,
the the first decline since May 1992. The largest decreases were in
prices of imported non-oil industrial supplies, followed by capital
goods and motor vehicles. Part of the decline in prices was
associated with the appreciation of the dollar last fall. For
October-November combined, the small average increase in non-oil
import prices was substantially less than the 4-1/2 percent annual
rate rise recorded in the third quarter. The strength of the rise
in the third quarter was attributable in part to the depreciation of
the dollar over the summer; increases were particularly strong in
prices of imported capital goods and to a lesser extent consumer
goods and automotive products.
Prices of exports declined slightly recently. In November,
prices of nonagricultural exports decreased for the third
consecutive month. Most of the decline was in capital goods (led by
a 1.6 percent -- not an annual rate -- drop in the prices of
exported computers, peripherals, and semiconductors) and in
industrial supplies. Prices of agricultural exports increased
slightly in November following a sharp decline in October. For the
two months combined prices declined 6 percent at an annual rate;
price declines were recorded for the last 4 quarters.
Price data for December will be released January 29.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Banks reported large net capital inflows in November, reversing
their outflows in October (line 1 of the Summary of U.S.

IV-7
International Transactions table). A large part of the $20.5
billion inflow was accounted for by foreign-chartered banks,
continuing a trend observed since August in the monthly-average data
on net borrowing by these banks from own foreign offices and IBFs.
See line lb of the table on International Banking Data. However,
unlike previous months when inflows were recorded primarily by non-
Japanese banks, significant inflows were registered in November by
Japanese and non-Japanese banks alike. Data for December indicate
that the trend has continued through the end of the year (line 1b).
As in previous months, the November inflow registered by foreign-
chartered banks coincided with asset growth at these banks; all
categories of assets were involved.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury obligations
soared to $16.4 billion in November (line 3 of the Summary table).
$3.3 billion of the total was purchased by Japanese residents, while
$7 billion and $5 billion went through the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands Antilles, respectively. The net purchases in November
reflected Treasury's mid-quarter refunding schedule and, thus, are
not likely to have been repeated in December.
Net purchases of other U.S. bonds by private foreigners were
small in November (line 2a of the Summary table); purchases of U.S.
government agency bonds more than accounted for the total.
Information on new U.S. issues in the Eurobond market suggests
continued low net purchases of corporate bonds in December. Foreign
net purchases of U.S. stocks were positive in November (line 2b).
U.S. residents continued the buildup of their holdings of
foreign securities (line 2c). Of the $4.4 billion increase in net
holdings in November, most was in stocks ($3.6 billion); the small
total for net purchases of foreign bonds did, however, mask a $2
billion decline in U.S. holdings of Japanese bonds. Net purchases

with large increases in October and November in the spread between
Eurodollar deposits and the Treasury bill rate. The recent increase
in deposits contrasts with the downward trend over the last two
years.
Foreign official reserve assets held in the United States fell
by over $9 billion in November (line 4 of the Summary table).
Spain, Taiwan, and Canada accounted for most of the decline, while
Mexico registered a significant increase. German holdings declined
marginally. Preliminary data from the FRBNY for December indicate a
reversal of the November picture, with net official inflows in the
$7 billion range and Germany accounting for most of the total.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign-exchange value of the dollar, in
terms of the other G-10 currencies, is little changed on net since
the December 22 FOMC meeting, as shown in the accompanying chart.
The dollar rose against the both the mark and the yen through early
January on expectations of interest rate reductions in Germany and
Japan. At its peak, the dollar had gained 3-1/2 percent versus the
mark and nearly 2 percent against the yen. The dollar gave up those
gains late in the period on postponed expectations of German easing
and on the market perception that the new Administration intends to
reduce the fiscal deficit and that the Federal Reserve is not likely
to tighten in the near term.
The Bundesbank signalled a slightly easier monetary stance on
January 7 by announcing that its next 4-day RP tender would be at a
fixed rate of 8.60 percent, down from .75 percent at previous

IV-11
tenders. Reflecting expectations of further Bundesbank easing.
German 3-month interest rates declined 1/2 percentage point, to 8.45
percent. However, Bundesbank officials have since indicated that
further easing is not imminent due to concern over German inflation
that, at 4 percent last year, is well above the Bundesbank's
preferred inflation rate of 2 percent. In addition, the Bundesbank
is reluctant to ease significantly before German wage negotiations
are completed in the Spring.
The Bank of England surprised the market on January 26 by
reducing its minimum lending rate from 7 percent to 6 percent.
Sterling declined sharply following the rate cut, and is now nearly
2 percent lower against the dollar than at the last FOMC meeting.
Market participants and the press viewed the easing move as
indicating panic among U.K. policymakers over continued weakness in
the U.K. economy.
The French franc remained under downward pressure during the
first half of the intermeeting period, with that pressure coming to
a head on January 5 when the Bank of France suspended its 5-to-10
day RP facility that had offered funds at a rate of 10 percent, and
replaced it with an emergency overnight facility at a 12 percent
rate. The franc recovered sharply following the Bundesbank's
announcement of lower RP rates on January 7. That move was seen as
indicating that German policymakers were prepared to adjust their
actions to preserve the current ERM central exchange rate between
the franc and the mark. Since then, the French franc has moved 1-
1/4 percent above the bottom of its ERM band versus the Belgian
franc and the Dutch guilder. French overnight interest rates remain
at 12 percent, though French 3-month interest rates have come down
from a high of 12-3/4 percent to 11-3/4 percent, about 1/4 point

higher than on December 22. The yield on the French bellwether bond
has declined 1/4 percentage point over the intermeeting period,
indicating in part a renewed confidence in the French franc.
The Irish punt came under heavy downward pressure near year-end
following the announcement that Irish capital controls, imposed in
September, would be lifted on January 1. The punt traded at or near
its bottom limit for over a week, and the Irish central bank was
forced to raise its overnight lending rate to 100 percent to defend
the currency, amid speculation that an Irish devaluation was
imminent. The punt recovered soon after the French franc, and Irish
overnight lending rates were reduced to as low as 14 percent. On
January 27, however, following the U.K. rate cut and sterling's
subsequent slide, the Irish punt was pushed again to the bottom
limit and the Central Bank of Ireland raised its overnight rate back
up to 100 percent.
The Desk did not intervene.
In foreign equity markets, German stock prices rose about 2-1/2
percent over the intermeeting period, spurred by the prospect of
lower German interest rates. U.K. stock prices were unchanged on
net, while the Nikkei index of Japanese stock prices declined more
than 6-1/2 percent over the period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Activity in the major industrial countries appears to have
remained weak in the fourth quarter and high unemployment rates
increased further. Partial fourth-quarter data for both Japan and
western Germany, including marked declines in industrial production,

IV-14
suggest that negative growth may have continued through the end of
1992. With the unemployment rate in western Germany reaching 7.2
percent (s.a.) in December and with fairly modest settlements so far
in the current round of labor-market negotiations, prospects have
brightened for an outcome for wage increases that is within the
German government's objectives. In France, recent data on
industrial production, exports, and consumption also suggest that
the pace of economic activity has slowed. Preliminary third-quarter
data for Italy show that real GDP fell 2.4 percent (s.a.a.r.), with
weakness in all domestic components. Unemployment rates in both
France and Italy have edged upward. Fourth-quarter data for the
United Kingdom have been weak, with industrial production
contracting in November and the unemployment rate (s.a.) rising to
10.5 percent in December. The Canadian economy continues to move
ahead at a modest pace with somewhat stronger employment, shipments,
and orders. Continued sluggish demand has kept output well below
capacity in all major foreign countries, and on balance inflationary
pressures have remained subdued. The leading exception is Germany
where inflation in December increased 3.7 percent on a year-over-
year basis. Passthroughs to domestic price levels of the effects
from the recent depreciation of exchange rates in Italy and the
United Kingdom have been muted to date by slack in those economies.
Individual country notes. In Japan, recent indicators suggest
continued weak activity. In December, industrial production (s.a.)
fell 1.0 percent to a level 8.2 percent below that of a year ago.
For 1992 as a whole, industrial production fell 6.1 percent compared
with 1991. Retail sales sagged further, recording a 12-month
decline of 5.7 percent in December, after falling 3.3 percent in
November. Sales of durable goods, including at- s, have been
especially weak. New passenger car registraticr- (s.a.) declined

1.4 percent in December, falling 7.9 percent below their year-
earlier level. New machinery orders (s.a.) rose slightly, by 3.9
percent, in November, after falling almost 31 percent in October;
the 12-month decline from November 1991 was 21 percent. The
unemployment rate (s.a.) edged up to 2.3 percent in November. The
job-offers-to-applicants ratio (s.a.) a more sensitive indicator of
labor market conditions, declined a further 3.1 percent in November,
falling to 37 percent below its peak of March 1991. Another sign of
labor market weakness has been a drop in overtime hours, which
showed a 12-month decline of 24.3 percent in November. The
strongest monthly indicator continues to be housing starts (s.a.),
which increased 1.5 percent in November and were up 8.3 percent on a
12-month basis.
Consumer prices in the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) fell 0.3 percent in
December, while their 12-month increase was only 0.9 percent.

However, nearly all of the recent weakness in the 12-month measure
of consumer prices has been caused by a drop in perishable food
prices that had been elevated in late 1991 by the effects of a
typhoon. Excluding these items, the 12-month consumer price
inflation rate was about unchanged at 1.9 percent in December.
Wholesale prices (n.s.a) also were unchanged in December and showed

IV-19
a 12-month decrease of 1.4 percent. The 12-month increase in wages
edged down to 2.2 percent in October.
The current account surplus was $117 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the
January through November period. In 1992, the overall trade surplus
was $107 billion, as exports increased 8.1 percent from 1991 and
imports fell slightly. The trade surplus with the United States
increased by $5.6 billion, mostly due to increased exports.
On December 26, the cabinet approved a draft budget for fiscal
year 1993, beginning in April. The draft budget is relatively
austere, with proposed spending on key expenditure categories, such
as public works, actually below likely spending levels for the
current fiscal year, after taking into account recently passed
supplemental expenditures. If the government's relatively
optimistic forecast of 3.3 percent real growth is not achieved,
another supplemental budget containing expansionary fiscal measures
will be necessary later this year, and plans for added fiscal
stimulus are under active semi-public discussion in Japan.
In western Germany, figures recently released by the Federal
Statistical Office for growth in real GDP estimated an increase of
1.5 percent on a year-over-year basis. However, these figures were
not adjusted for the changing number of working days from year to
year. Once adjusted for working-day variation, these estimates
imply a decline in real activity during the fourth quarter similar
to that estimated by FR staff.
Data for industrial production (s.a.) point to a significant
decline in the fourth quarter, with production for October and
November on average more than 2.6 percent below the third-quarter
level. The volume of new orders for west German manufactured goods
(s.a.) has fallen steadily since early last year and in October and
November on average was almost 6 percent below its level in the

IV-20
third quarter. After remaining steady throughout 1991 at roughly
6.3 percent, the unemployment rate (s.a.) in western Germany has
edged up since last February and reached 7.2 percent in December.

Consumer prices increased 3.7 percent in December on a year-
over-year basis, bringing inflation in 1992 up to about 4 percent
from the 3.5 percent pace registered in 1991. Consumer price
inflation is expected to accelerate somewhat in January, owing to an
increase in the VAT of one percentage point at the beginning of the
year. The state of North Rhine-Westfalia reported price inflation
of 4.5 percent in January relative to year-earlier levels.
Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) in western Germany dropped 1.9 percent in
October and November on average on a year-over-year basis.
Increases in producer prices have moderated significantly, and in
October and November on average were up 0.5 percent from year-
earlier levels. Import prices (n.s.a.) in western Germany began to
edge down in June, and in November were almost 4 percent below their
level a year earlier.
After deteriorating significantly in the first quarter of last
year, the pan-German current account (n.s.a.) widened further in the
second and third quarters. The current account deficit reached a
cumulative $22 billion in November, about $4 billion more than
during the same period of 1991.

IV-21
Through December, M3 in western and eastern Germany combined
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.8 percent in
1992, relative to the fourth quarter of 1991. In 1992, monetary
expansion remained well above the Bundesbank's target range for M3
growth of 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent. The Bundesbank's M3 target for
1993 is somewhat higher, with growth in the 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent
range. The Bundesbank has attributed the upward adjustment in its
M3 target range for 1993 to a revision in its outlook for the growth
of potential output in combined Germany. In early January, the
Bundesbank announced a repurchase operation at a fixed interest rate
of 8.60 percent, about 15 basis points lower than previous RP
tenders, indicating its intention to ease market interest rates
somewhat. The markets are anticipating further reductions in the
months to come.
Results so far from this year's round of wage negotiations have
been consistent with the government's wage goals, and continued
progress on wage restraint may provide scope for an easing in
official interest rates. Workers in the insurance and steel
industries have agreed to wage increases of 4.2 and 3.4 percent,
respectively. In addition, steel workers agreed to extend their
contract over an 18-month period. The union representing public
sector employees (2.3 million workers), the probable trendsetter,
has recently begun negotiating its bid for a 5 percent increase; a
settlement in the 4 percent range is thought likely.
In France, most indicators point to a weak fourth quarter.
Industrial production fell 4.5 percent (s.a.) in November, more than
reversing a 0.8 percent increase in October. Industrial production
in manufacturing fell 2.1 percent in November, after dropping 1.7
percent in October. (The total measure was distorted by unusually
cold weather.) The unemployment rate rose again in November.

IV-22
reaching 10.5 percent, the third consecutive monthly increase. Real
consumption of manufactured products, equal to one-third of total
consumption, registered a sharp decline of 5 percent (s.a.) in
November, more than offsetting the 2.1 percent October rise.
The consumer price index was unchanged in December, leaving the
index 2.0 percent above its level one year earlier. This favorable
inflation performance is partly attributable to declines in food and
energy prices. Inflation is expected to pick up in the first half
of 1993 due to a 30 percent increase in tobacco prices (half
occurring in January, and half in May) which should raise the CPI by
0.5 percentage points.
France registered another trade surplus of $1.1 billion (s.a.)
in December. The trade surplus for 1992 as a whole was $5.6
billion, following a trade deficit of $5.3 billion in 1991.
In Italy, economic growth continues to slow. Recently released
provisional data show that third-quarter GDP fell 2.4 percent
(s.a.a.r) from the level attained in the second quarter, and was up
only 0.8 percent on a year-over-year basis. The only component
providing positive growth was the external sector, as all domestic
components fell. Recent data point to continued weakness.
Industrial production (n.s.a.) fell 1.6 percent on a year-over-year
basis in November and, according to survey results, is likely to
drop about 2.1 percent in December. Consumer confidence was down
14.7 percent in November from 12 months earlier, and likely fell 15
percent in December.
The rate of consumer price inflation continued to slow. The
year-over-year rate of consumer price inflation decelerated slightly
to 4.7 percent in December, the seventh consecutive month in which
the year-over-year rate weakened from the previous month. However,
increases in the producer price and wholesale price indices may

IV-23
indicate that recent good news on consumer price inflation may be
nearing an end. In October, the producer price index rose 2.0
percent on a year-over-year basis, up from 1.8 percent in September,
while the wholesale price index increased 2.5 percent, up from 1.0
percent in September. Both changes reflect effects of lira
depreciation that may soon be evident in higher consumer price
inflation.
On December 22, Parliament approved the final portion of the
1993 budget that cuts 93 trillion lire (5.8 percent of GDP) from the
trend deficit. This draconian measure notwithstanding, the 1993
deficit is estimated to reach 150 trillion lire (approximately 9
percent of GDP)
Latest data show little evidence of economic recovery in the
United Kingdom. Real GDP rose 0.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third
quarter, but all of the increase was accounted for by a rise in oil
and gas production. Industrial production (s.a.) dropped 0.7
percent in November, to a level 0.6 percent above the average in the
third quarter. Manufacturing production (s.a.) fell 0.5 percent in
November to a level 0.6 percent below the average of the third
quarter. Unemployment (s.a.) increased in December, and the
unemployment rate climbed to 10.5 percent.
Consumer spending continued to be weak in recent months: the
volume of retail sales (s.a.) slumped 0.7 percent in December after
stagnating in November. The volume of sales in 1992 as a whole was
0.7 percent higher than in 1991, but at roughly the same level as in
1990. Consumer confidence rebounded somewhat at the end of last
year but remains depressed. Business confidence has improved as
well.
Inflation continues to decline. Consumer prices (n.s.a.) fell
0.4 percent in December after falling 0.1 percent in November. The

IV-24
12-month rate of inflation fell to 2.6 percent, its lowest rate
since 1986. Excluding mortgage interest rates, consumer price
inflation edged up to a 12-month rate of 3.7 percent in December.
Producers' output prices (n.s.a.) rose 0.2 percent in December after
increasing 0.4 percent in November and were 3.5 percent above their
year-earlier level. The prices of producers' materials and fuels
(n.s.a.) rose 1.7 in December after rising 3.2 percent in November
and 2.6 percent in October, largely reflecting price increases of
imported materials associated with sterling's devaluation. They now
stand 5.2 percent above year-earlier levels, but have not fed
through into output prices yet, in part owing to ongoing moderation
of labor costs.
Activity indicators for the fourth quarter in Canada are
consistent with continued slow growth: the unemployment rate (s.a.)
was unchanged at 11.5 percent, but total employment (s.a.) rose 0.4
percent. Housing starts (s.a.), however, fell 3 percent in the
fourth quarter. Industrial production was about unchanged in
October, and GDP rose 0.2 percent. Factory shipments (s.a.) for
October and November, taken together, increased 2.0 percent from
their third quarter average, new orders (s.a.) were up 1.6 percent,
and nominal retail sales (s.a.) rose 0.7 percent.
Recent price data show that inflation has remained-moderate.
The targeted 12-month change in the CPI, excluding food and energy
(n.s.a.), increased from 1.8 percent to 2.0 percent in December.
The all-items CPI was up 2.1 percent over this period, and wholesale
prices rose 3.5 percent. Wage settlements (a.r.) in the first ten
months of 1992 produced average increases of 2.2 percent, compared
with a 3.6 percent average for all of 1991 and 5.6 percent for 1990.

IV-25
The October-November merchandise trade surplus (s.a.a.r.) rose
to $13.3 billion from $5.9 billion in the third quarter, as exports
of machinery and equipment surged.
In Russia, price increases may be accelerating. Prices are
reported to have increased 25 to 27 percent in December, after
increasing 26 percent in November. Weekly increases in food prices
are reported to have jumped to about 10 percent in January, after
averaging 5.6 percent in November and December. Concerns over
inflation appear to have affected the exchange value of the ruble.
Since January, the ruble has depreciated 22 percent, reaching 568
rubles/dollar on January 26.
The new government of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
continues to send somewhat mixed signals about its intentions. A
decree reimposing price controls on all producers of certain basic
goods was signed in early January, but it was, apparently, reversed
after being criticized as unenforceable. Last week, Deputy Prime
Minister Fyodorov announced that the Cabinet had approved an anti-
inflation program that included restrictions on the fiscal deficit
and higher interest rates. But Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is
scheduled to present an "anti-crisis" plan to the Supreme Soviet on
January 28, and that plan is expected to emphasize increasing output
through continued subsidies for state-owned enterprises.
On January 1, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR)
divided into two new independent states: the Czech Republic and the
Slovak Republic. Prior to the dissolution of the CSFR, the Czech
and Slovak governments signed 25 treaties and agreements defining
post-split relations between their republics. The two most
significant economic treaties pertain to establishment of a customs
union and a monetary union. Increasing tensions following the split

IV-26
have strained the monetary union, and a currency split within the
next month appears increasingly likely.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Mexico, Argentina, and Korea, tight monetary and fiscal
policy during 1992 yielded substantial reductions in consumer price
inflation, at the cost of slower growth in domestic production. In
Mexico, the CPI rose by 1.4 percent in December, yielding an 11.9
percent inflation rate for the entire year. In Argentina, the CPI
rose by only 0.3 percent in December, leaving it 17.6 percent higher
than a year earlier. In both countries, the inflation rate for 1992
was the lowest in almost two decades. In Korea, the CPI rose by 4.5
percent during 1992, down from 9.3 percent during 1991; while
Korea's real GNP growth slowed to an estimated 4.9 percent in 1992,
down from 8.4 percent in 1991. In response to weaker economic
conditions, the Korean government reduced a broad range of interest
rates in late January. In Venezuela, consumer prices rose 31.9
percent during 1992, about the same as in the previous year, while
Brazil's inflation rate remained steady at 20 to 25 percent per
month throughout 1992. In Taiwan, inflation and GDP growth during
the year were dampened by lower net exports; the CPI rose by 3.4
percent during 1992, while real GDP (Q3/Q3) grew 5.8 percent, the
slowest rate in two years.
Recent trade data indicate that lower aggregate demand in the
industrial countries reduced export growth during 1992 in five of
these six developing countries, while Brazil's export growth
remained strong due to its low real exchange rate. Import growth
was strong in Mexico and Argentina due to their appreciating real
exchange rates, leading both countries to raise some import taxes
and non-tariff barriers in late 1992. Changes in domestic
absorption during the year contributed to strong import growth in

IV-27
Venezuela and Taiwan, a stable level of imports in Korea, and
reduced imports in Brazil. The combination of these factors
resulted in deteriorating trade balances during 1992 in Mexico,
Argentina, Venezuela, and Taiwan, and an improved trade balance in
Brazil and Korea.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, the CPI rose by 1.4
percent in December, leaving it 11.9 percent higher than a year
earlier. This was the lowest twelve-month increase since 1975. The
cumulative current account deficit through September 1992 was $16.2
billion, up from $9.3 billion during the same period in 1991,
foreshadowing a deficit of around $22 billion for 1992 as a whole.
In recent months, attempts to curb the growth of imports have
centered on tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Tariffs ranging from
15 to 25 percent were imposed on cattle and beef, which were
formerly duty-free. Importers were required to demonstrate that
they have met their tax obligations for the past four years, and to
submit to extensive audits if the value of intended imports exceeds
the gross revenues declared in any of the four preceding years.
The cumulative capital account surplus for the nine-month
period grew to $17.2 billion from $14.5 billion a year earlier;
capital inflows appear to have remained large in the fourth quarter.
The exchange rate for the peso has remained within a narrow range,
with a level of 3.0965 new pesos per dollar on January 26. (The new
peso, worth 1,000 old pesos, was introduced January 1.) The 28-day
Treasury-bill rate was 17.1 percent at the January 27 auction, down
from a mid-October peak of 19.7 percent. A new interbank money
market was launched on January 20, with an auction that yielded a
28-day interest rate of 22.3 percent.
In Taiwan, third-quarter real GDP growth (Q3/Q3) decelerated to
5.8 percent, the slowest pace in two years. Slowing net exports due

IV-28
to weak world demand continued to act as a drag on growth. For all
1992. Taiwan's merchandise trade surplus shrank to $9.5 billion,
from $13.3 billion in 1991. Merchandise exports grew 7 percent in
1992, less than half the corresponding 14.5 percent growth rate for
imports. Net exports would have fallen even further in the absence
of trade with China; preliminary estimates show total Taiwan-China
trade jumping about 26 percent in 1992, with Taiwan enjoying a
healthy bilateral surplus.
Investment flows continued to help sustain Taiwan's economic
activity, with year-on-year quarterly growth expanding from 11.4 to
14.8 percent between the second and third quarters; investment
growth for the entire year was projected at 13 percent.
Consumer price inflation was dampened during most of 1992 by
the slowdown in aggregate demand. A typhoon in September caused an
extraordinary jump in prices, but the CPI fell during each of the
following three months. As a result, the inflation rate for 1992
(Dec./Dec.) was only 3.4 percent, in comparison with 4.4 percent
during 1991.
Taiwan's main opposition party made deep inroads into the
popularity of the ruling Nationalist Party, winning nearly one-third
of the seats in December's legislative elections.
The Korean government's controls on construction and tight
credit policy led to a slowdown in domestic demand, a reduction in
inflationary pressures and an improvement in Korea's trade deficit
during 1992. According to projections by the Bank of Korea, real
GNP growth slowed in 1992 to 4.9 percent, from 8.4 percent in 1991.
Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent during 1992, down from 9.3 percent
during 1991. In 1992, Korea's trade deficit (on a customs clearance
basis) halved to $4.9 billion. While exports grew 6.8 percent in

IV-29
1992, imports were essentially unchanged after growing rapidly in
1991.
In response to weaker economic conditions, the Korean
authorities lowered rediscount rates and regulated deposit and loan
rates by 1 to 3 percentage points in late January. The rate on
rediscounts of commercial bills was lowered to 5 percent from 7
percent, and the rate on rediscounts of trade bills was lowered to 6
percent from 7 percent, marking the first adjustment of these rates
since November 1989.
In December, Kim Young Sam, the ruling party candidate, was
elected president for a five-year term beginning February 1993. Kim
will be Korea's first civilian president in over 30 years.
In Brazil, economic conditions remain depressed and inflation
high. Real GDP in the third quarter was 5.2 percent below a year
earlier. The inflation rate remained in the range of 20 to 25
percent per month throughout 1992. Brazil's trade surplus rose to
$15.7 billion in 1992 from $10.6 billion in 1991, mainly because of
depressed internal demand and improved competitiveness. Exports
grew by 14.6 percent during 1992, while imports were 2.2 percent
lower than in 1991.
In December, the Brazilian Senate ratified the July 1992
agreement between Brazil and the Bank Advisory Committee (BAC) on a
$44 billion Brady-style debt restructuring package. In mid-January,
Brazil paid $170 million in interest arrears to commercial bank
creditors to fulfill its promise to increase interest payments from
30 percent to 50 percent of interest due, retroactive to July 1992.
In late January, Brazil and the BAC are scheduled to present the
restructuring package to Brazil's estimated 1,000 commercial bank
creditors.

IV-30
However, implementation of the debt restructuring package will
require at least $3.2 billion in collateral for the par and discount
bonds that most creditors are expected to choose. Brazil has
refused to finance the full amount from its international reserves
(recently reported to be $20 billion), and currently does not
qualify for financing from the IMF and other multilateral
institutions due to non-compliance with the fiscal targets contained
in its January 1992 IMF standby arrangement.
Finance Minister Gustavo Krause resigned in December due to
disagreement over President Franco's advocacy of government controls
of prices and interest rates. In late January, Planning Minister
Paulo Haddad was appointed to replace Krause, while Yeda Crusius was
named to to fill the vacancy left by Haddad.
In Venezuela, preliminary data indicate that real output grew
7.3 percent in 1992, compared with 10.4 percent in 1991. Inflation
for the twelve months ending in December 1992 was 31.9 percent,
about the same as in the previous year. Higher import volumes and
lower oil export prices shifted the current account to a deficit of
an estimated $3 billion for 1992 from a surplus of $1.7 billion for
1991.
In Argentina, the CPI rose by only 0.3 percent in December; the
inflation rate for the entire year was 17.6 percent, the lowest rate
in almost two decades. Preliminary reports indicate that industrial
production remained stagnant during the second half of the year.
The trade deficit for 1992 is now estimated to have reached $1.2
billion, compared with a $4.4 billion surplus in 1991. Imports grew
by 74 percent during 1992, while the level of exports remained
unchanged.
Current economic conditions have been strongly influenced by
the Convertibility Law, which has fixed the peso at parity with the

IV-31
U.S. dollar since April 1991. Although Argentine inflation has been
declining rapidly, the real exchange rate has appreciated by more
than 40 percent over the past 21 months. The central bank was
forced to purchase $300 million in pesos during early November 1992
in order to maintain parity. Due to a combination of high seasonal
demand for pesos and diminished expectations of a near-term
devaluation, the central bank sold a record $1.5 billion in pesos
during December, and has sold another $500 million in pesos during
the first 20 days of January. Peso interest rates have fallen from
a peak of over 50 percent in early November to about 30 percent in
December and early January, but still remain very high relative to
pre-November levels of around 15 percent.
