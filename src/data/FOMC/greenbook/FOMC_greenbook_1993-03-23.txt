The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Available data suggest that the economy has expanded
significantly further in the current quarter, but less rapidly than
in the final quarter of 1992. Nonfarm payroll employment rose
sharply in February after a modest gain in January, and the
unemployment rate has moved down further. Industrial production has
continued to advance at a fairly brisk pace. However, consumer
spending and homebuilding have been less robust of late than they
were in the latter part of last year. Meanwhile, recent inflation
indicators have been less favorable than those of late 1992.
Labor Markets
Nonfarm payroll employment rose 365,000 in February, the
largest monthly rise in four years, and the civilian unemployment
rate edged down further to 7.0 percent. To some extent, the
February gain reflects a reversal of special factors that, in prior
months, had depressed job growth, especially in construction,
services, and retail trade.1 Since the February survey week,
initial claims for unemployment insurance (adjusted for the
emergency unemployment program) have averaged around 380,000, a
level consistent with further modest employment growth. The most
recent Employment Outlook Survey conducted by Manpower, Inc., is
more optimistic. It shows hiring plans for the second quarter
strengthening sharply. This is the most positive reading since the
first half of 1990.
1. Adverse weather, especially in the West, held down
construction employment in December and January. The February gain
in services followed an unusual decline in January. In the retail
sector, less-than-usual seasonal hiring at general merchandisers in
November and December may have resulted in larger gains on a
seasonally adjusted basis in January and February.

In the household survey, too, employment was up sharply in
February. The 380,000 gain more than offset a 240,000 drop in the
preceding month, and the level of household employment at last
regained its pre-recession peak. Further, the number of unemployed
fell another 137,000 in February. The number of persons working
part-time for economic reasons was up nearly as much as household
employment, but this measure is quite volatile from month to month.
Since last June, involuntary part-time employment has been about
flat, while total household-survey employment has increased nearly
1 million.
The recent pickup in employment contrasts with the continuing
announcements of layoffs by major corporations. However, these
phenomena may be reconciled by reference to the oft-noted importance
of small businesses in job creation, although the contribution is
difficult to pin down precisely. The SBA publishes data that
estimates employment growth in industries dominated by small firms--
defined as industries in which at least 60 percent of employment is
in firms having fewer than 500 employees. According to these data,

industries dominated by small businesses have outperformed other
industries during both the recession and the recovery.2
Unfortunately, the SBA data do not extend past September of 1992; at
that point, however, the industries dominated by small business had
boosted their employment by 1/2 percentage point in 1992, while the
industries in which large firms are more prominent had continued to
contract.
According to revised figures, productivity in the nonfarm
business sector soared in the fourth quarter, rising 4.8 percent at
an annual rate. The gain reflected a 5.7 percent increase in output
and a 0.9 percent gain in hours. The increase in hours, although
still far from robust, was the strongest quarterly reading since the
early-1991 trough. Over the four quarters of 1992, total hours
worked were unchanged, while productivity increased 3.2 percent.
Relative to prior trends, productivity growth last year appears to
have been particularly impressive outside of manufacturing, perhaps
the best in many years.

Little new information on labor costs has become available
since the last Greenbook. Average hourly earnings of production or
nonsupervisory workers increased 0.2 percent in February after a
0.4 percent rise in January. Over the past twelve months, average

industries dominated by firms of fewer then 500 employees.

Industrial Production
Industrial production rose 0.5 percent in January and
0.4 percent in February, making it likely that growth in the
industrial sector during the first quarter will outpace the
4.4 percent annual rate of increase posted for the final quarter of
1992. In manufacturing, increases have been fairly widespread this
year. Changes in mining and utilities output in January and
February were mixed and about offsetting, on balance.
Motor vehicle assemblies fell to 11.1 million units (annual
rate) in February, from the relatively high January level of
11.6 million units. Truck production, after reaching near-record
levels in January, declined to 4.9 million units in February. The
rate of increase in light truck sales slowed in February, leaving
the days' supply of light trucks little changed. Auto assemblies,
at 6.3 million units, were about unchanged in February but days
supply moved up noticeably. Manufacturers' announced plans call for
car assemblies to increase slightly in March, but a substantial
underbuild from the scheduled rate seems likely. Despite the drop
in motor vehicle assemblies in February, production of automotive
parts and related equipment and materials increased in that month;

II-8
gains in these areas contributed substantially to industrial
production growth in February.

Outside of motor vehicles, manufacturing output rose, on
average, 1/2 percent in January and February, boosted by sharp gains
in consumer durables and computers, as well as by increases in a
number of other categories, including non-energy materials and
construction supplies. Production of non-energy materials had
substantially lagged the growth in output of final products in the
fourth quarter of 1992, but it seems to have made up ground in the
first quarter. Surveys suggest that new orders continued to
increase through February, and the lean factory inventories early in
the year--together with reports of lengthening delivery times--also
point to further gains in production in coming months.
Output in the mining and utilities sectors has been volatile in
recent months. Unusually cold weather in February, which followed
unusually warm weather in January, caused utility output to surge
nearly 4 percent; that gain contributed 0.3 percentage point to the
overall February rise in industrial production. Partially
offsetting this increase was a sharp decline in mining, reflecting a
coal miners' strike and reductions in drilling activity.

Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending appears to be advancing at a solid pace in
the early part of 1993, although not so rapidly as at the end of
last year. Retail sales of items other than autos were strong in
February after a weak January, but auto sales fell in February and
consumer confidence has retreated somewhat from the high levels
registered toward the end of last year.
Total nominal retail sales increased 0.3 percent in February
after no change in January. The acceleration in the retail control
category, which excludes auto sales and sales at building material
and supply stores, was larger, as sales rose 0.8 percent in February
after staying flat in January. The January-February average of
nominal sales in the retail control category was up 1.1 percent from
the fourth-quarter average, not at an annual rate.
Real disposable personal income was unchanged in January, after
rising an average of 0.5 percent per month during the fourth quarter
of 1992. Although a number of special factors affected January

income growth, they were roughly offsetting in total. Personal
income growth should pick up in February, as labor market data
suggest that private wages and salaries grew substantially in that
month.
Sales of new cars and light trucks fell to a 12.8 million unit
annual rate in February from a 13.4 million unit annual rate in
January. The February decline in sales was concentrated in
domestically produced cars. Sales of domestically produced light
trucks rose a bit further last month, to a 4.7 million unit annual
rate. Light vehicles sales averaged a bit higher during the first
twenty days of February than in January but then plunged during the
last reporting period, when several regions were affected by severe
winter weather. In the first ten days of March, sales rebounded but
remained below the average for February.
Consumer sentiment registered a moderate decline in February as
measured by both the Michigan and Conference Board surveys. The
Michigan index had risen 15 points between the third quarter of 1992
and December; it now stands 5 points below that December peak.
Among the components of the index, respondents' assessments of their
current financial situation and of business conditions over the next
year both worsened notably in February. Some analysts have
attributed the drop in sentiment in February to reaction to
President Clinton's economic policy speeches on February 15
and 17. However, it is interesting to note that, while people
3. During December, an increase in farm subsidies, bonus payments
in the motor vehicle industry, and retroactive social security
benefit payments all pushed up personal income growth; these factors
then depressed January growth by an equivalent amount. Higher final
tax payments associated with last year's change in withholding
payments also lowered January growth, while cost-of-living
adjustments in federal transfer payments and pay increases for
Federal workers boosted January growth.
4. The timing of the drop within the month lends some weight to
this argument, as comparison of the preliminary and final readings
for February indicates that consumers were more confident in the

may have viewed the medicine he prescribed as a little bitter,
responses to a separate question on confidence in government policy
improved in February.
Housing Markets
Housing activity have been surprisingly soft in the early part
of 1993. Housing starts fell sharply in January and retraced only
part of that decline in February; the average for the two months was
about 4-1/4 percent below the average for the fourth quarter.
Permit issuance also has declined. The slowing in activity has been
concentrated in the single-family segment of the market.
Multifamily starts are still bumping along the bottom, although they
did move up in February from a historically low January reading.
Other indicators of single-family housing demand also turned
down in January, from high December levels. Sales of new homes fell
particularly sharply. Unlike last year, when problems in imputing
some sales led repeatedly to sharp upward revisions of the
preliminary estimates, new procedures at the Census Bureau make it
unlikely that the January sales figure will be substantially
revised. Sales of existing homes also fell in January, but
nonetheless remained near the thirteen-year peak recorded in
December. Sales prices for both new and existing homes were soft
relative to a year earlier. At least part of the softness in prices
may have been the result of a shift in the composition of sales
toward starter homes: Recovery in the trade-up market has lagged
that for first-time buyers, as many current owners apparently remain
reluctant to sell for what they perceive as temporarily low prices.

Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan cautions that
too few interviews are conducted in the second half of the month for
the intra-month readings to be a reliable gauge of changes in
sentiment.

The softness in the recent indicators is at odds with the
continued improvement that has been apparent in key determinants of
housing activity. In particular, the continued downtrend in
mortgage interest rates has brought rates down to the lowest levels
in decades, and the standard measures of affordability indicate that
the cost of homeownership has moved down further in 1993, after
substantial improvement in 1991 and 1992 (chart). The recent pickup
in employment should also be a plus for housing markets.
Nonetheless, some negatives are evident on the supply side of
the market and may be exerting drag on activity. Lumber prices have
moved up dramatically in recent months, with quotes in some spot
markets up more than 90 percent since September. If passed through
to homebuyers, a cost increase of this size would boost the price of
a typical new home roughly 4 percent and offset about half the gain
in cash flow affordability resulting from declines in mortgage rates
since last fall. However, the volume of lumber sales that has
actually occurred at these spot prices is unclear, as an index of
producer prices of variety of lumber products used in homebuilding
has risen by a much smaller amount--14 percent--since September.
Indeed, the absence of any firming in house prices suggests the rise
in lumber prices probably does not explain much of the recent
softness in activity. It is possible, however, that higher lumber
prices are making speculative builders more cautious, and custom
builders may be facing resistance from buyers unwilling to absorb
the higher costs of lumber prices. Builders have also reported some
shortages of lots ready for construction, but again, in the absence
of home price increases, these shortages probably have not been, at
least yet, of major importance. Weather in January and February
does not appear to have been unusually adverse for housing; March

may be a different story, however, owing, especially, to the severe
blizzard in mid-March.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment, which posted a strong gain in
the fourth quarter of last year, appears likely to repeat that
performance in the current quarter, led by a jump in outlays for
producers durable equipment.
Shipments of computing equipment shot up in January to a level
substantially above the fourth-quarter average. As has been the
case for the past year or two, demand for computing machines, appears
to be strongest for products in the middle and at the low end of the
market, such as workstations and PCs. Part of this strength
reflects upgrades from older machines with 286 processors to new
machines with 386 and 486 chips.5 In the mainframe segment of
the market, industry sources indicate that demand for large, high-
performance mainframes is doing fairly well; however, demand for
other types of mainframes reportedly is still weak, in part because
of competition from less-expensive, but increasingly powerful,
products such as workstations.
Shipments of complete civilian aircraft also posted a solid
gain in January, but the demand seems to be coming from abroad.
Domestic shipments appear to be flat or down slightly so far this
quarter, and the long-term picture for domestic aircraft purchases
remains bleak. American Airlines has indicated that, to bolster its
balance sheet, it will take as many as twenty-five planes out of
5. Industry analysts expressed some concern late in 1992 that
clients would delay purchases in order to upgrade to the Pentium
processor, which Intel was to have introduced early in the first
quarter of 1993. Intel has since delayed the introduction of the
chip, both because of technical problems and because the company is
concerned that the Pentium chip would reduce the product life of the
current-model 386 and 486 processors. Release of the chip is now
scheduled for March 22, 1993. but our contacts report that supplies;
will be limited. It now appears that very few Pentium-based
machines will be sold in 1993.

service by eliminating unprofitable routes. As a result, American
is expected to defer or cancel some existing orders. More
generally, competition in the airline industry remains fierce and
continues to put strain on the financial positions of the major
carriers. However, not everyone is cutting back.. Non-airline
firms, such as United Parcel Service and International Leasing
Finance Corporation, are in healthier financial condition than the
airlines and have stepped up orders for planes to be delivered after
1994. In part, this increase in orders stems from price discounts
offered by producers in the face of slack demand overall.
Business purchases of equipment excluding aircraft and
computers posted a solid increase in the fourth quarter, after
having been on a plateau for the previous couple of years.
Manufacturers' shipments surged in December but fell back in January
to about the level of the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, the January
level of new orders for these goods was 2-1/2 percent above the
average last quarter, suggesting further advances in shipments in
coming months. Among components, new bookings for communications
equipment appear to have cooled off in recent months, but orders for
various other types of equipment have picked up noticeably.
Outlays for structures were down slightly in the fourth
quarter, as continued declines in industrial and office construction
more than offset a spurt in the drilling sector and a further
advance at utilities. Drilling activity was boosted late last year
by the expiration of a tax credit at yearend. Since the beginning
of this year, drilling rigs in use have declined appreciably.
Elsewhere, data on construction put in place through January
indicate continued weakness in a number of sectors. Industrial
construction, which fell in both 1991 and 1992, dropped further in
January of this year. Construction of office buildings, where

excess supply still appears to be a major problem, also declined
further in January. Construction in the other commercial sector,
which consists mainly of retail and warehouse properties, advanced
early in the fourth quarter but dropped back on net over December
and January.
Commercial real estate prices are still declining, but perhaps
at a slower pace than before. In the FDIC's latest Survey of Real
Estate Trends, the proportion of respondents reporting lower prices
continues to exceed those reporting higher prices, but the margin
has been shrinking. In addition, the margin of respondents
reporting better conditions in the commercial market over those
reporting worse conditions widened in the first quarter; possibly,
however, respondents are merely saying that conditions are less bad
than before. Meanwhile, the Russell-NCREIF index of appraised
values of commercial properties continues to exhibit marked
weakness: The national average value of office buildings fell
7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992, while the average value of
retail properties dropped 4 percent and that of warehouses dropped
roughly 5 percent. Because of its reliance on appraised values, the
Russell-NCREIF index may tend to lag a little behind the course of
transactions prices.

Business Inventories
Business inventories appear to have declined slightly in early
1993. For all manufacturing and trade, current-cost inventories
were reduced at an annual rate of about $4 billion in January, and
the corresponding inventory-sales ratio held steady at its low
December level. Stocks in January appear to have been at
satisfactory levels in most sectors and were quite lean in some.
In manufacturing, sharp drawdowns of factory stocks during the
fourth quarter left most industries with relatively low inventory-
sales ratios, and although the ratio for the sector as a whole rose
slightly in January, its level in that month still was relatively
low. Given the leanness of stocks early in the year and the
strength in recent indicators of demand for manufactured goods, some
producers may well be in a position in which inventory cuts will
start to give way to moderate restocking. A notable exception is
the aircraft industry: Inventories of aircraft and parts have been
declining sharply for more than a year as prospects for the industry
have deteriorated, and an end to the contraction may still be some
way off. Excluding aircraft and parts, the January reduction in
manufacturers' stocks was the smallest since last summer.
In the trade sector, the inventory situation of merchant
wholesalers improved further in January. Strong January sales drew
down stocks at many types of wholesale establishments, in many cases
reversing the large accumulation of the fourth quarter. For the
sector as a whole, the inventory-sales ratio in January was near the
bottom of the range seen over the past two years, and no serious
overhangs were evident for any of the major groupings. In retail
trade, inventories increased by a small amount in January after a
large rise in December. Increases in auto dealers' stocks accounted
for more than half the accumulation over the two-month period.

Excluding autos, retail stocks edged down in January, and the
inventory-sales ratio for non-auto stores held steady at a point
within the relatively narrow range observed over the past year.
Ratios for furniture stores and stores selling general merchandise
turned back down in January; the ratio for apparel stores edged up a
bit further, however, and apparel sales fell in February according
to the advance report on retail sales.
Federal Sector
The unified budget deficit amounted to about $90 billion in the
first four months of fiscal year 1993 (FY93); this figure was about
$9 billion less than the deficit in the first four months of the
previous fiscal year. The smaller deficit is in large part a
reflection of increased receipts from individual nonwithheld taxes,
which for the fiscal year to date are up nearly a third from the
level of a year earlier. The strength of these collections is
traceable to the pickup of economic activity over the year, a
tightening of the requirements on estimated tax payments, and last
March's withholding change, which left some taxpayers having to make
up a gap later on.
The change in withholding schedules also is expected to hold
down refunds significantly this tax season. As of March 5, however,
refunds were running only slightly below the pace of last year,
because greater use of electronic filing is speeding up the refund
process.
Outlays during the first four months of fiscal 1993 were about
2 percent greater than during the similar period of fiscal 1992,
held down in part by a pickup in sales of RTC assets, which resulted
in a reduction in net outlays for deposit insurance. In addition,
defense expenditures have fallen more than 5 percent this year, and

net interest outlays are essentially flat. Other categories of
spending show increases of about 7 percent on average.
The Clinton Administration released a preliminary description
of its economic program on February 17.6 The program aims to
provide short-term stimulus to the economy, expand various programs
with the objective of raising long-term growth, and reduce the
deficit substantially over the next few years. The short-term
stimulus package includes an extension of emergency unemployment
benefits, provision of a temporary incremental investment tax
credit, and increases in grants to state and local governments for
investment in infrastructure. The longer-run initiatives include a
variety of proposals to increase training, research, and education
and to encourage investment in real estate and small business plant
and equipment.
According to the Administration, the proposed deficit reduction
measures would cut $473 billion from the cumulative deficit over the
five-year period FY1994-FY1998. The reduction would be accomplished
through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. Tax rates
would be increased for individuals with high incomes and for large
corporations, and a new energy tax would be levied on the BTU
content of fuels. Spending cuts would be largely borne by defense
and Medicare. The Administration projects that, under the program,
the deficit will fall to around $200 billion in FY1996 and FY1997.
In FY1998, however, the deficit is expected to move back up to about
$240 billion as a result of a projected continuation of the runaway
growth in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, a leveling out of the
deficit reductions in the President's program, and an assumed
slowing in the baseline path of economic growth.

provided in an appendix to Part 2 of the Greenbook.

CBO has released a preliminary analysis of the President's
program. According to CBO, his proposals would reduce the deficit
by $406 billion over the FY1994-FY1998 period, $67 billion less than
estimated by the Administration. The budget committees in the
Congress have taken account of the CBO assessment in shaping their
budget resolutions for FY1994. Accordingly, they have altered the
President's program by enough to produce the full amount of deficit
reduction he had targeted, largely through bigger reductions in
spending.
The budget resolutions will be considered by the full House and
Senate this week. The Administration has targeted August for
passage of a budget reconciliation bill that would implement the
longer-run deficit reduction and economic plan: passage of the
individual appropriations bills should take place shortly
thereafter. A portion of the short-term stimulus package has
already been passed; the President has signed a bill further
extending emergency unemployment insurance benefits, which had been
due to expire March 6 and will now expire October 2. The
Administration also plans to submit a major proposal for health care
reform by May.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases by state and local governments appear to have
dipped early this year after a small increase during 1992.
Employment in January and February was about equal to the fourth-
quarter level, while real construction spending fell 4 percent at a
monthly rate in January to its lowest level since mid-1991. The
weakness in construction was widespread, with much of the reduction
concentrated in the areas of educational facilities and highways and
bridges. On a monthly basis, of course, these data are highly
volatile and are subject to substantial revision.

II-31
Many governments continue to face severe fiscal problems. The
combined deficit of operating and capital accounts, excluding social
insurance funds, as reported in the national income accounts, has
exceeded $40 billion in each of the last two years. However,
preliminary data for the fourth quarter showed moderate improvement.
Also, recent data from the Center for the Study of the States
suggest that state tax revenue in the fourth quarter of 1992,
excluding the effects of legislated changes and adjusted for
inflation, was up nearly 3 percent from the same period a year
earlier, the largest gain since mid-1990.
Recent survey information from the National Association of
Counties provides additional perspective on budgetary problems at
the county level. The projections for both revenue and
expenditures by most counties were off target in 1992, and most have
had to take a variety of actions to balance their budgets. On the
receipts side, 91 percent of the counties reported lower-than-
expected tax receipts despite a stronger economy in 1992; counties
depend largely on property taxes which do not necessarily respond
to movements in aggregate economic activity and may respond to
changes in real estate values only after a substantial lag. In
addition, 94 percent of the counties stated that they received less
staff aid than they had anticipated.
Among budget-balancing measures taken by these counties, the
most common were increases in taxes and fees. In addition, many
dipped into reserve funds, and 77 percent cut programs or services.
Outlay reductions most frequently cited were in the area of capital
projects. The counties surveyed reported a backlog in
7. The survey, taken between November 1992 and January 1993,
covered 66 urban counties, representing one-third of the nation's
population. Most counties answered the survey in terms of fiscal
year 1992, which ended in June for some and December for others.

infrastructure projects waiting for funding valued at $10 billion
and covering a wide range of areas.
The counties do not expect their fiscal situation to improve
much in the year ahead. As the assessment cycle for real property
is gradual, many counties fear that the full impact of declining
property values on tax collections has not yet been felt. And many
counties anticipate still further reductions in state aid.
Prices
After favorable reports on consumer prices in November and
December, the most recent figures for the CPI have come in on the
high side of the past year's trends. A jump of 0.5 percent in the
total CPI in January was followed by a further rise of 0.3 percent
in February. The CPI excluding food and energy rose a half
percentage point in both months; its change over the twelve-month
period ending in February was 3.6 percent, up from the low of
3.3 percent that was reached at the end of 1992, but still a little
below the reading of a year ago.
On the whole, the recent data would seem to suggest that the
underlying inflation picture is not quite as favorable as it
previously had appeared. At the same time, though, there has been
little evidence of deterioration in the underlying determinants of
price change. Despite recent gains in output and employment,
substantial slack remains in labor and product markets. In
addition, non-oil import prices have remained subdued. The signals
on inflation expectations have been mixed in recent months, but
there is as yet no evidence of a significant upward shift in price
expectations. Nor has deterioration been evident in the recent
qualitative reports on price- and wage-setting behavior in the
business sector.

Consumer food prices rose only 0.1 percent in February, after a
jump of 0.4 percent in January. Vegetable prices, which had surged
in January, dropped back a little last month; however, more recent
information suggests that renewed increases may be in train, owing
to planting delays in California early in the year and more recent
flooding in certain regions of Arizona--areas that are important
suppliers at this time of year. But, despite these--and other--
short-run supply problems that continue to arise in the food sector,
the underlying trend in food price increases remains quite low; the
cumulative increase over the twelve months ended in February
amounted to just 1.7 percent.
Consumer energy prices fell 0.4 percent in February, pulled
down by declines for natural gas and electricity, the latter of
which reportedly was a reflection of sizable rebates to customers in
Virginia. Gasoline prices moved up somewhat further in February,
after a large January rise. However, private survey data for early
March suggest that retail gasoline prices may since have edged off a
bit.
For goods other than food and energy, retail prices increased
0.5 percent in February, the same as in January. Tobacco prices
rose further last month, largely reflecting an increase in federal
excise taxes. In addition, apparel prices surged for a second
month. Fairly sharp price increases also were reported in January
and February for other nondurables. By contrast, the prices of
durable goods turned down 0.1 percent last month, reversing part of
January's rise. Car prices were unchanged in February, as increases
in manufacturers' list prices apparently did not feed through to
transactions prices at retail.
8. Federal excise taxes on cigarettes rose 4 cents per pack at
the beginning of the year. Because prices in most cities are
sampled every other month for the CPI, the tax increase shows up in
both January and February.

Prices of non-energy services rose 0.4 percent in both January
and February, after a stretch of several months in which the monthly
changes had averaged about 0.3 percent. The indexes for both
residential and owners' equivalent rent appear to have firmed a
little, after very modest increases around the middle of last year.
In addition, the index for airfares climbed by more than 5 percent
over the first two months of the year, as some discounts that
previously had been in place were scaled back or ended; recent
reports appear to suggest that discounting of fares may have picked
up again in March, however.
In the past year, prices of capital goods have remained
subdued, on balance. For the year ending in February, the PPI for
capital goods was held down by computer prices, which dropped
13-1/2 percent during the preceding twelve months. Prices of other
capital goods also continued to slow, rising just 2-1/4 percent in
the twelve months ending in February, about 1/2 percentage point
below the year-earlier pace. Although modest price increases for
motor vehicles last year contributed to this slowing, the February
PPI indicates that passenger car and light truck prices are
accelerating at the manufacturers' level.
Spot prices of industrial materials have risen, on balance,
since the last Greenbook, consistent with the pickup in industrial
activity. The Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials
prices has increased about 2 percent since the end of January, and
other indexes have moved up as well. To a considerable degree, the
indexes are being driven by very large increases for a few products,
rather than widespread price hikes. For example, the metals
subcomponent of the Journal of Commerce index actually has fallen
about 1 percent since the last Greenbook; higher prices for steel
have been offset by declines for other metals. Elsewhere, lumber

II-40
and plywood prices have rocketed this year, but the surge appears to
have slowed a little in March.
Turning to broader measures of materials prices, the PPI for
intermediate materials continued to move up in February. The
twelve-month change in that price measure has risen over the past
year, but only to a rate of 1-3/4 percent.

APPENDIX
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PROGRAM
President Clinton presented his economic program to the
Congress in mid-February. In early April, he will deliver a formal
budget containing detailed and revised budget proposals and updated
budget estimates. Meanwhile, the Congress is considering the
President's proposals in the context of developing a budget
resolution for FY1994.
The President's Program and the Budget Outlook
Some of the President's proposals are aimed at stimulating
economic activity over the near term, while others are geared to the
achievement of longer-run economic and budgetary objectives. The
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) projects that the proposed
changes, on net. would increase the budget deficit $13 billion in
FY1993 but reduce it significantly in subsequent years (table 1).
By FY1998, the program is projected to lower the deficit, on net, by
$148 billion ($53 billion from net reductions in spending on items
other than interest, $73 billion from net increases in taxes, and

$22 billion from savings on debt service).2 The savings are
measured relative to a baseline that already incorporates the
reductions in defense spending (with certain adjustments) proposed
by President Bush in his January 1992 budget request but holds the
rest of the budget at "current services" levels.
Assumingcenactment of the President's program, the deficit is
projected to expand from $290 billion in FY1992 to $332 billion in
FY1993; it then narrows to the area of $200 billion in FY1996 and
FY1997 before moving back up to $241 billion in FY1998. By
comparison, the baseline deficit in FY1998 is estimated at
$390 billion. The budget projections are based on essentially the
same "technical" assumptions as were used in OMB's January budget
document (with updated estimates for deposit insurance). In a break
from convention, however, the Administration draws the economic
assumptions underlying the budget projections from CBO's January
Report (table 2). Consequently, neither the economic assumptions

2. Unlike the President. we classify the proposed rise in the
share of social security benefits subject to income tax as a tax
increase. Also note that savings from actions to shorten the
maturity structure of the debt are included in the "spending
reductions" line in table 1: the debt service savings are
attributable entirely to the reduced size of the debt.
3. In contrast, when the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
constructs a baseline, it assumes full compliance with the Budget
Enforcement Act (BEA) of 1990, which established limits on
discretionary spending through FY1995. For years after 1995, CBO
assumes that discretionary spending will grow in line with
inflation.
4. The effects of the President's health care plan were not
included in the economic program. However, he apparently expects
savings from health care reform to help keep the budget deficit on a
downward track after the mid-1990s.

II-A-3
nor the projected deficits incorporate the effects of the
President's program.
Spending Provisions
According to OMB estimates, the President's proposals will
bring about a significant shift in the composition of federal
spending while lowering appreciably its overall rate of growth
(table 3). All told, enactment of the President's proposals would
increase spending $9 billion, on net, in FY1993. However, by the
late 1990s, outlays would be more than $50 billion below baseline
levels. When interest savings are added in the net reduction in
spending grows to $75 billion in FY1998.
The President would provide appreciable new funding for so-
called investment items (notably, human capital and public
infrastructure). Such outlays are key elments of both the stimulus
package and the longer-run economic plan. In the near term,
they would go primarily for highways, mass transit, and airports and
would be channeled through state and local governments. Over the
longer run, the President would also direct money to furthering
technology (for example, high-performance computing), expanding
education and training programs, achieving environmental objectives,
and improving public health programs.
Meanwhile, outlays for other programs would be reduced nearly
$100 billion below the President's baseline by FY1998. The largest
cuts would be in national defense and in health care entitlements,
but many smaller programs would be scaled back as well. With
respect to defense, the Administration's proposals would reduce
spending by FY1998 to a level $36 billion (more than 12 percent)
below that proposed by President Bush in 1992. President Clinton's
proposals would require further cuts in military and civilian DoD
personnel, as well as in procurement and other aspects of the
military budget. If the proposals are implemented, the resulting
level of defense spending in FY1998 would be nearly 20 percent below
that needed to maintain 1993's real funding level. (By FY1998,
military personnel would be down to 1.4 million, and civilian DoD
personnel to 832.000.)
As for the health entitlement programs, the President's
proposed reductions are essentially stopgap measures pending release
of a comprehensive health care reform plan in May. The savings in
Medicare would come primarily from restraints on payments to health
care providers and, after 1995, from higher premiums for
Supplementary Medical Insurance. If enacted into law, these changes
would lower the level of Medicare spending more than 8 percent
($20 billion) by FY1998, but the program still would grow about
5. In A Vision of Change for America, the Administration provides
an alternative economic forecast that is conditional on enactment of
its program: It shows both larger increases in real output
(notably, real GDP growth slows only to 2-1/2 percent per year in
the late 1990s) and more inflation. When the more favorable
economic assumptions are used, the Administration expects the
deficit to shrink a bit more rapidly over the next few years and to
remain essentially unchanged as a percent of GDP after the mid-
1990s.
6. The other major spending increase in the stimulus package is a
further extension of the extended unemployment benefits program. It
was passed by the Congress and signed into law in early March.

10 percent per year, on average, between FY1992 and FY1998. The
Medicaid program also would see some cuts, largely through a
suspension of the federal requirement that states pay for at-home
personal care services.
Revenue Proposals
A major theme of the President's economic program is a shift in
the distribution of tax burdens: Upper-income individuals and
businesses generally would face higher liabilities, while many
middle- and low-income individuals would see little change in their
overall tax payments. On net, the proposed changes to the tax laws
would add slightly to the deficit in FY1993 but are expected to
narrow it appreciably thereafter--by almost $75 billion in both
FY1997 and FY1998 (table 4). In addition to new initiatives, the
package contains the extension of several expiring provisions, but
these would have only a small effect on the deficit.

Upper-income individuals would pay higher income and social
insurance taxes under the President's plan. The increase in income
taxes would be accomplished through (1) the addition of a fourth
(36 percent) bracket for taxable incomes over $140,000 (joint
returns) and $115,000 (single returns), (2) the imposition of a
10 percent surtax on taxpayers as their taxable incomes exceed
$250,000 (on both joint and single returns), (3) the permanent
extension of provisions that limit the itemized deductions and phase

II-A-6
out the personal exemptions claimed by high-income taxpayers, and
(4) adjustments to the provisions concerning the alternative minimum
tax. However, the maximum marginal rate on capital gains would
remain at 28 percent. Liabilities would be higher for calendar year
1993, but the additional payments would not be required until 1994.
Also, beginning in 1994, the share of social security benefits (of
well-to-do retirees) subject to income tax would be raised from
50 percent to 85 percent, and the wage base cap on Medicare taxes
(currently at $135,000) would be repealed.
Meanwhile, low-income families would benefit from an expansion
of the earned income tax credit (EITC). The EITC, which provides a
subsidy to low-income working Americans with children, would be
expanded in 1994 to cover families with incomes of up to $30,000 per
year (currently, the credit, which is indexed, is fully phased out
when either adjusted gross income or earned income exceeds $23,050);
the President also wants to increase the size of the credit. The
expansion of the EITC, along with additional funding for food stamps
and for energy assistance, will help offset the effects of the
proposed energy tax on many lower-income households.
On the business side, the largest revenue gains would come from
an increase in the corporate tax rate, from 34 percent to
36 percent, on taxable incomes above $10 million; liabilities would
be higher for calendar year 1993, but payments would not be required
until 1994. In addition, deductions for business meals and
entertainment would be reduced.
On the other hand, businesses would be able to claim an
investment tax credit (ITC) on outlays for producers' durable
equipment made after December 3, 1992. Large businesses would get a
temporary incremental ITC on investments made before the end of
1994; the credit would be worth up to 7 percent of outlays above a
firm's fixed base. with the percentage depending on the service
lives of the equipment purchased and the base related to the firm's
previous level of spending. Small businesses would receive a
permanent ITC applicable to all new investment; the credit would be
up to 7 percent in the first two years and up to 5 percent
thereafter.
Among other key revenue provisions, a broad-based energy tax
would be introduced. The tax would be implemented in equal annual
installments over a three-year period beginning July 1, 1994, and
would be based in part on a fuel's energy content as measured in
BTUs. When fully phased in, the tax would raise $22 billion per
year (the figure for both FY1997 and FY1998). Also, the current
7. Large businesses are those with annual gross receipts of at
least $5 million; such firms account for about 85 percent of total
outlays on producers' durable equipment. With respect to the base
for the incremental credit, companies would have the option of
averaging investments made during 1989-91 or during 1987-91.
8. The tax is specified as a dollar amount per million BTUs, is
indexed to the GDP deflator, and is higher for oil than for other
energy sources. The higher tax for oil is meant to improve air
quality (oil burns dirtier than other fuels) and to discourage
dependence on foreign energy sources. At current prices, the
proposed BTU tax translates to ad valorem tax rates of 5 percent for
gasoline, 4 percent for residential natural gas, 3 percent for
residential electricity, and 8 percent for home heating oil.

II-A-7
gasoline tax would be extended beyond its September 30, 1995,
expiration date.
CBO Re-Estimates
On March 3, CBO released its preliminary analysis of the
President's budget program (table 5). CBO expects the program to
generate somewhat less deficit reduction than does the
Administration; for example, CBO foresees savings of $132 billion in
FY1998, compared with OMB's estimate of $148 billion. Nonetheless,
the five-year budget projections of the two agencies are quite
similar. The differences in the estimated effects of the
President's proposals are not large, and they are roughly offset by
differences in the CBO and OMB baselines (adjusted for conceptual
differences).

1. Increases in revenues are shown with a negative sign because they
reduce the deficit.
Several factors contribute to the differences in the estimates
of the President's proposals. About one-third of the discrepancy is
on the revenue side ($6 billion in F1998), where CBO adopts the
Joint Committee on Taxation's view that the Administration is
overstating the likely revenue gains from the proposed tax rate
increases for high-income individuals and from compliance and
enforcement efforts. On the outlay side, CBO identifies inadvertent
errors in OMB's estimates of the savings in Medicare and defense ($4
billion combined in FY1998); also, because of the lack of
specificity in the Administration's proposed changes in debt
management policies, CBO chooses not to recognize the claimed--,-

II-A-8
savings. Finally, the smaller amount of deficit reduction estimated
by CBO tempers the projected savings in debt service.
The budget committees in the Congress have taken account of the
CBO assessment in shaping their budget resolutions for FY1994.
Accordingly, they have altered the President's program by enough to
produce the full amount of deficit reduction he had targeted,
largely through bigger reductions in spending. President Clinton
has indicated his willingness to consider spending cuts in excess of
those he proposed in February.
Budget Process
President Clinton wants to extend the Budget Enforcement Act
(BEA), with limited modifications, beyond its scheduled expiration
in 1995; he is expected to release detailed proposals shortly. In
general, he would extend the caps on discretionary spending through
1998, carry the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) provisions governing mandatory
spending and taxes through 2003, support the use of sequestration to
enforce compliance, and enhance the President's rescission
authority.
The President's program would lift nondefense discretionary
spending in FY1993 above its BEA cap (as estimated by the staff).
However, given the reductions in defense funding already in place,
total discretionary spending would remain below the level implied by
combining the defense and nondefense caps (table 6). In FY1994,
when the separate caps disappear, total discretionary spending would
exceed the aggregate cap by about $10 billion; a similar discrepancy
would be present in FY1995. In any event, the overruns for
discretionary programs in those two years would be more than offset
by the proposed changes to mandatory spending and taxes, holding the
deficits well below the levels implied by the BEA caps on
discretionary spending.

1. BEA caps are staff estimates. Official caps will be released
with the Budget in April.
9. The additional funding for extended unemployment benefits was
given the "emergency" designation and thus did not require the
adjustments to other mandatory spending or taxes normally required
by the PAYGO rules. The Congress is expected to apply the emergency
designation to the rest of the stimulus package as well. Under the
BEA rules, when discretionary funding is considered to be for
emergency purposes, the caps are adjusted to accommodate it.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Money market conditions have been stable since the February
FOMC meeting. Bond yields trended downward over much of the
intermeeting period, however, responding to the prospect of a
significant reduction in the federal deficit; heightening of
concerns about inflation prompted some backup this month, but rates
remain appreciably below their early February levels. Despite the
possibility that fiscal restraint might lead to a weaker economy.
yields on nonfederal securities have dropped as much as Treasury
rates, maintaining the relatively narrow risk premia. Stock prices
moved up on a broad front. All major indexes, except the NASDAQ,
posted new highs before retreating slightly recently. The NASDAQ
index reached a record high shortly after the last FOMC meeting, but
it lately has been dragged down by weakness in share prices of
health-related firms.
The rally in the capital markets has sparked a heavy volume of
bond issuance by businesses and state and local governments and also
mortgage borrowing by households--a great share of which is for the
repayment of existing debt. Corporations also have tapped the
equity market in volume, in many instances using those proceeds to
repay bank loans and other short-term debt. Growth of total
domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be moderate this
quarter--probably around the 5 percent pace observed on average in
1992.
Weakness in the monetary aggregates persisted in February. Ml
turned down 1/4 percent at an annual rate, and M2 dropped
3-3/4 percent. The contraction in M3 slowed but still was at a
1-3/4 percent rate in February. Seasonal adjustment problems may
have accentuated the latest declines, but underlying monetary growth
III-1

III-2
has been weak at best, and the apparent large increase in M2
velocity is a significant departure from past patterns.
Interest Rates
The rally in the bond market pushed long-term Treasury rates in
early March to their lowest levels in twenty years. Most private
long-term rates also moved to near twenty-year lows; the thirty-year
fixed-rate conventional mortgage, for example, recently dropped
below 7-1/2 percent, the lowest level since April 1973. Spreads on
fixed-rate mortgages, however, have widened about 10 basis points
since mid-February because of a reassessment of prepayment risk and
because of increased interest rate volatility. Rates on securities
having shorter maturities have fallen less: The three-year Treasury
rate is now at 4.50 percent--still 12 basis points above its low
last September.
The interest rate declines over the past year or so have
translated into substantial reductions in costs for both businesses
and households. According to one estimate, nonfinancial
corporations saved $2-1/2 billion in interest expense in 1991 and
1992 by calling high-coupon bonds. This saving, however, was
dwarfed by the direct effect of lower short-term rates, which
produced a total estimated reduction in interest expenses, net of
interest earned on short-term assets, of $27 billion in the two-year
period. For households, the estimated savings on fixed- and
variable-rate mortgage loans has amounted to more than $27 billion
over the past two years. Neither of these estimates includes
savings from debt refinancings taking place in 1993.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 contracted in February at an annual rate of 3-3/4 percent,
following declines of 1/2 percent and 3-1/2 percent in December and
January. respectively. The weakness in February appears to have

been magnified by the use of seasonal adjustment factors that now
reflect nonseasonal movements in the aggregate in 1991 and 1992. In
each of those years, M2 growth was buoyed in February by the lagged
effects of earlier monetary easings, a factor not present in 1993.
In addition, reflecting the pause in applications in late 1992,
settlements of mortgage refinancing transactions have dropped off,
thereby depressing liquid deposit holdings. The current wave of
refinancing applications should result in a rebound in the spring.
These phenomena especially affected Ml, which contracted at a
1/4 percent annual rate in February, a result of declines in both
demand deposits and other checkable deposits. M1 would actually
have posted a healthy gain, had the seasonal factors not reflected
the unusual movements of the past two years. Similarly, the
weakness in some of the more liquid nontransaction components of M2,
such as savings accounts (including money market deposit accounts)
and retail money market mutual funds, may have been overstated.
Although an undistorted M2 as a whole might have grown a little in
February. it would still be below the lower bound of its 1993 growth
cone. Preliminary data for early March suggest only a small advance
in M2.
M2 velocity in the final quarter likely will rise well in
excess of the 3-1/2 percent to 4 percent increases recorded through
much of last year, even after adjusting for the special factors that
have depressed the aggregate recently. In addition, staff
money-demand models, embodying historical patterns of M2, income,
and opportunity costs, have continued to overpredict M2 growth.
The rechanneling of credit flows outside the depository system
continues to be responsible, at least in part, for the increases in
M2 and M3 velocity. Indeed, stock and bond mutual funds posted

III-5
additional strong inflows in January, and net sales of long-term
funds reportedly remained robust in February.
Also damping money growth in recent quarters has been heavy
reliance by banks on funds not in the broad monetary aggregates.
Deposit inflows at commercial banks fell well short of the increase
in bank credit in 1992--even more so than average in the 1990-91
period (table). Bank borrowing from abroad has been strong for some
time now, and banks have also been relying more heavily on
subordinated debt and equity.

M3, which contracted at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in January,
fell 1-3/4 percent in February, reflecting a rebound in
institution-only money market mutual funds. Preliminary data
suggest further weakness in M3 in March.
Bank credit edged up in February after decreasing in the
previous month, though the turnaround was more than accounted for by
a bank acquisition of a large thrift institution in a private
transaction. The effect of the acquisition was particularly evident
in bank holdings of securities, which surged last month after a rare
contraction in January. Consumer loans strengthened as well, partly
reflecting tax-refund-anticipation loans. Business and real estate
loans, by contrast, declined.

Evidence on credit availability to businesses has been mixed of
late. Information from the Survey of the Terms of Bank Lending
conducted in early February showed that nonprice lending terms had
remained fairly restrictive and that spreads had remained wide,
particularly for small prime-based loans.1 However, surveys of
overall credit conditions for small businesses conducted by the
National Federation of Independent Business have generally reported
less tightness over the past year, although some backtracking was
seen in the February survey. Business loans at small banks, which
are thought to go mainly to small and medium-sized firms, rose in
February for the second consecutive month after steady declines over
the previous two years. To improve credit availability to small
businesses, federal bank and thrift regulators announced on March 10
a program that would, among other things, lower the documentation
required for small business loans made by strong and well-managed
institutions and reduce the appraisal burden on small business loans
secured by real estate.
Business Finance
The weakness in commercial and industrial loans and a further
contraction in February in outstanding commercial paper of
nonfinancial corporations are consistent with efforts by firms to
extend the maturity of their debt in response to lower long-term
interest rates. Nonfinancial firms publicly issued an estimated
$19 billion of corporate bonds in February, only slightly less than
the record $19.8 billion issued in January; volume in the first half
of March also appears to be running close to a record pace. Nearly
1. These spreads, however, could be somewhat misleading. To the
degree that banks may have become more accommodative toward marginal
borrowers, such new borrowers would qualify for loans at larger
spreads than others who had been receiving credit, tending to raise
the average. A few banks responding to the Senior Loan Officer
Survey in late January indicated a tilt toward accommodation.

40 percent of nonfinancial bond offerings thus far in 1993 carry
maturities of more than fifteen years, the highest proportion since
1986, when 46 percent of offerings had maturities that long. The
same measure averaged only about 17 percent over the 1987-91 period.
In March. Texaco marketed a fifty-year bond, the first such issue by
an industrial firm in fifteen years.
Corporations have been refunding many bonds that were
originally issued in the 1960s and 1970s. In the recent round of
refinancing, firms also have called some bonds issued in 1986, when
the last trough in rates occurred. Bond calls by nonfinancial
corporations through early March have amounted to $23 billion; if
interest rates hold near current levels, calls in 1993 could surpass
last year's record $78 billion.
With no widening in quality spreads, more than $12 billion of
junk bonds have been issued thus far in 1993, compared with
$37 billion in all of 1992. Two companies--Time Warner and News
America--account for $5 billion of this year's volume. Time Warner
used the proceeds to redeem preferred stock issued in its 1990
merger, while News America is paying down bank debt. Other
below-investment-grade companies that have earmarked their 1993 bond
offerings proceeds to pay off bank debt include Bally's Health &
Tennis, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical. Overhead Door. Cablevision
Systems, Dial Page. Di Giorgio. BE Aerospace, Standard Pacific, and
Weirton Steel.
Net equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations appears so far
in 1993 to be nearly matching the $27 billion pace of 1992. In
February, gross issuance soared to $5 billion, the largest volume
since last June. February's offerings included $1 billion of
initial public offerings, mostly by small and medium-sized firms,
and a $2 billion issue by Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler will

III-10
reportedly use more than $1 billion of the proceeds to shore up its
underfunded pension plan. Sears raised $800 million by spinning off
20 percent of Dean Witter. In March, equity issuance has remained
strong, with initial public offerings already above the level of
each of the previous two months.
Recently, several prominent nonfinancial firms have sold large
issues of convertible preferred stock in the private placement
market. AMR Corp. UAL Corp. and Occidential Petroleum, for example,
have raised $2 billion with private placements sold under SEC Rule
144A. In 1992, U.S. companies raised an estimated $25 billion in
the 144A market (both debt and equity), up from $10 billion in 1991.
Securities sold under Rule 144A are similar in many respects to
those sold in the public bond and equity markets. As the private
market has become more liquid, the yield difference between private
and public securities has shrunk. Consequently, issuers have become
more willing to place in the private market, where they can avoid
the costs and delays of the SEC registration process.
Banking firms have continued to improve their capital ratios in
1993 by issuing securities in the public markets--more than
$500 million each of common and preferred stock, and more than
$3 billion of subordinated notes. As the profitability of the
banking industry has improved, rating upgrades have outnumbered
downgrades, and yield spreads on subordinated notes, at about 100
basis points over comparable Treasury notes, have declined to their
narrowest levels since early 1989. Over the intermeeting period.
bank stock price indexes have risen about 6 percent.
In contrast, the finance company subsidiaries of the Big Three
auto companies have been downgraded, prompting them to fund assets
with off-balance-sheet securitizations instead of unsecured
commercial paper and medium-term notes. In 1993, the auto finance

III-11
companies have already securitized almost $6 billion in auto loans,
compared with a record $19 billion in 1992. To appeal to money
market mutual funds, some of these securities have been structured
with short maturity tranches. Asset-backed securities with floating
interest rates have also become more common. In contrast to the
auto companies, banks have securitized less than $1 billion in
assets thus far in 1993.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The $63 billion federal deficit in the first quarter is being
financed with $53 billion of marketable borrowing and a $6 billion
rundown in the Treasury's cash balance. Nonmarketable borrowing has
remained weak, in part because of heavy redemptions of state and
local government series debt (SLGs) issued by the Treasury to
municipalities, as state and local governments have used marketable
Treasury securities recently for defeasance of advance refunded
bonds.2
Gross auction sizes have been pared back over the first quarter
because tax receipts have been stronger than anticipated. So far,
the Treasury has cut the size of the weekly bill auction from
$24.4 billion to $22.4 billion, while the size of the coupon auction
has been trimmed $250 million for two-year notes and $1 billion for
thirty-year bonds. Despite all this, the staff anticipates that the
Treasury will run into the debt ceiling in early April.
2. In an advance refunding, an issuer refinances an outstanding
bond before its first call date by selling a new issue (the
refunding bonds) and using the proceeds to defease the outstanding
bonds through the purchase of Treasury securities. The cash flows
of the Treasury securities are used to make the interest and
principal payments on the outstanding bonds until they are redeemed
on the call date. The municipal issuer is not allowed to earn a
positive spread between the yield on the Treasury securities and the
refunding bonds; a negative spread, however, can be incurred, as has
been the case in recent months. The current steep Treasury yield
curve means that interest rates on long-term refunding bonds
generally exceed yields on shorter-term Treasury securities used for
defeasance.

Remarks made early-on by the Administration about projected
savings from shifting the emphasis of borrowing away from the long
bond initially were interpreted by market participants as suggesting
the likelihood of drastic reductions in long bond supplies.
However, more recent statements from the Treasury indicate that the
matter is still under review. Nevertheless, the anticipation that
the Treasury may cut back further on long-bond supplies appears to
be a factor buoying prices at that end of the market.
New debt issues of government-sponsored enterprises continue to
be well received; spreads over Treasuries have remained narrow.
ranging from 5 basis points for short maturities to 20 basis points
for ten-year issues. The price of Sallie Mae's stock has declined
about one-third since the Clinton Adminstration in February
announced plans to shift funding of student loans from private
capital lending to direct lending by the Treasury in order to reduce
costs to the government.
Municipal Securities
The rally in the bond market has favored long-term tax-exempt
securities, on which yields have fallen nearly 40 basis points since
the February FOMC meeting. In the first several weeks after the
President's State of the Union address, municipal bond yields fell
relative to long-term Treasury rates, as high-income individuals and
municipal bond funds stepped up purchases of tax-exempt securities
from an already rapid pace.
Offerings for new capital have fallen off sharply in the past
two months, but refunding volume has surged with the decline in
municipal bond yields. Refundings averaged about $11 billion per
month over the past three months, compared with a record average of
$8 billion per month in 1992. At current interest rates, refunding
activity is likely to remain brisk, with many of the long-term bonds

III-14
issued between January 1988 and June 1992 as likely candidates for
refinancing.3 The heavy calendar of bonds scheduled for sale
over the remainder of March could swell long-term offerings this
month to well over $20 billion, up from $16 billion in February.

Mortgage Markets
In addition to the drop in rates on conventional fixed-rate
mortgages (FRMs), initial rates on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
have declined about 30 basis points, to 4.78 percent, the lowest on
record. However, with the yield curve flattening, the initial rate
advantage of ARMs has narrowed slightly to around 270 basis points,
and weekly survey data show that ARMs now account for only about
15 percent of the volume of all mortgage loan applications at
mortgage banking companies, down from the 21 percent share recorded
at the end of 1992.
3. Market observers suggest that refunding an outstanding issue
is economically feasible when the difference between the coupon rate
and the market rate exceeds 100 basis points. At current interest
rates, refunding is feasible for an estimated $225 billion of
outstanding bonds.

III-15
Applications in February for home purchase loans at mortgage
bankers were at the highest pace recorded in the Mortgage Bankers
Association's (MBA) three-year-old series (chart), pointing to
increases in residential mortgage credit this spring. In addition,
the MBA index of refinancing applications has nearly tripled since
year-end and stands close to the level reached last July.
Most loans underlying outstanding mortgage-backed securities
have coupon rates above current mortgage rates. Indeed, according
to industry estimates, almost a third of outstanding mortgage
securities in the conventional market are backed by loans with rates
two percentage points or more above current rates. An additional
third have rates between one and two percentage points above current
rates. Consequently, prepayment rates are expected to increase
significantly this spring, and mortgage yield spreads in the
secondary market have widened a bit in anticipation. In turn, the
spread between initial rates on FRMs and Treasuries also has widened
somewhat over the past month but remained well below levels
experienced during the refinancing frenzy of 1986 (chart).
The demand for home loans continues to be satisfied largely
through issuance of mortgage-backed securities. Gross issuance of
federally related pass-throughs slowed a bit in January from the
rapid pace in November and December (table). However, issuance of
total agency pass-throughs remained above the 1992 monthly average
of $38 billion. In addition, issuance of total nonagency
pass-throughs in January remained near the record $7-1/2 billion
monthly rate of 1992. Data for February indicate that issuance
abated somewhat from the January pace.
Rated securities backed exclusively by nonperforming
residential mortgages were brought to market for the first time in
February, enhancing liquidity of mortgage assets further. EMC

19st, a subsidiary of Bear Stearns, sold a $131 million issue

enhancement in the form of over-collateralization. Separately, the
RTC privately placed $52 million of securities carrying a BBB rating

Consumer installment credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding increased at a
1-1/2 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in January, after a
5-1/4 percent gain in December. The January advance was entirely in
the revolving credit category. Auto loans declined in January,
after posting a sizable increase in December. Despite the increases
over the past few months, total installment credit remains below the
year-ago level.
Interest rates for consumer auto and personal loans at
commercial banks were little changed in the first week of February
from three months earlier. Even so, the average "most common" rate
on a forty-eight month new car loan edged down 3 basis points to
8.57 percent in February, the lowest in the twenty-year history of
the series. The average rate on credit card plans at commercial
banks declined 12 basis points to 17.26 percent, the lowest rate
since early 1980. The survey data may understate the decline in
credit card rates, as the "most common" rate reported by banks does
not reflect the lower rates made available over the past year to
selected subsets of cardholders. At the captive auto finance
companies, new car loan rates increased in January, in part
reflecting the end of some incentive plans; used car rates also rose
during the month.

commercial banks declined 0.05 percentage point in the fourth
quarter to 2.49 percent, according to the American Bankers
Association (ABA). (Precise comparisons with data prior to 1992 are
not possible because definitions have changed, but the ABA
delinquency rates declined throughout 1992.) The ABA credit card
delinquency rate fell 0.07 percentage point in the fourth quarter to
3.02 percent. The captive auto finance companies reported a
0.10 percentage point decline in past-due auto loans for the fourth
quarter, bringing the delinquency rate to 2.35 percent, the lowest
since the end of 1988. Call Reports for commercial banks also
showed a 0.20 percentage point decline in delinquent consumer loans
in the fourth quarter, lowering the rate to 3.81 percent (chart).

Delinquency rates on home mortgages declined to the lowest
level in more than a decade, according to the Mortgage Bankers
Association. The rate for loans delinquent sixty days or more, at
1.40 percent in the fourth quarter, matched the ten-year low that
occurred in the second quarter of 1990. Call Reports also showed
significant improvement in mortgage delinquency rates. Real estate
loan delinquency rates at commercial banks dropped to 6.02 percent,
the lowest since the third quarter of 1990. Loan delinquency rates
on both one- to four-family and commercial real estate dropped
nearly 25 basis points in the fourth quarter; loan delinquency rates
on multifamily properties registered a small decline.

Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed slightly in
December to $7.0 billion (seasonally adjusted, Census basis) from a
revised November deficit of $7.3 billion. Exports increased 3.9
percent while imports increased 2.6 percent in December. The gain
in exports was primarily in capital goods (aircraft and machinery).
The rise in imports was spread among most trade categories, with the
exception of oil. Data for January 1993 will be released on March 18
and will be included in the Greenbook supplement.

As shown on the next page, in the fourth quarter of 1992 the
trade deficit narrowed for the first time in three quarters (balance
of payments basis). A 4 percent increase in exports was led by
increased shipments of capital goods, both aircraft and machinery.
There was also an increase in exports of automotive vehicles
(especially to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and developing countries in

Asia). Exports and imports of gold both increased sharply in the
fourth quarter, largely reflecting transfers of gold from the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York out of the United States. Imports
rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter as increases in imports of
capital goods were partially offset by declines in imports of oil
and consumer goods.
By area, the largest gains in nonagricultural exports were in
shipments to Asia (particularly China and Taiwan). Exports to these
two areas increased 14 percent in the fourth quarter. By contrast.
nonagricultural exports to industrial countries increased only 2
percent in the fourth quarter. Non-oil imports from industrial
countries rose 7 percent in the fourth quarter, including a surge in
imports from Germany. Non-oil imports from Asia eased slightly in
the fourth quarter, after jumping sharply in the third quarter.
Nonetheless, these were 18 percent greater in the second half of the
year than in the first half of the year.
The value of oil imports fell in December, almost entirely the
result of a decline in price brought about by mild weather late in
the year and strong OPEC production. The quantity of oil imported
was essentially unchanged. For the fourth quarter, prices were down
slightly, the lagged response to the decline in spot oil prices that
began in mid-October. The quantity of oil imported was just below
the third-quarter pace.

perceptions of OPEC's willingness and ability to cut production have
shifted. Initial disappointment with the mid-February OPEC accord
pushed spot WTI to just above $19 per barrel, although prices
climbed shortly thereafter on indications of actual production cuts.
WTI now stands just below $20 per barrel.
Prices of Exports and Non-oil Imports
Prices of non-oil imports increased 0.2 percent in January.
The largest increase was in the price of imported agricultural
products. Prices of capital goods and automotive products edged up
slightly after two consecutive months of declines. The increases
were partially offset, however, by a decrease in the price of
imported consumer goods.
For the fourth quarter, on average, prices of U.S. non-oil
imports increased 1.4 percent at an annual rate according to BLS
data; this rise was substantially smaller than that recorded in the
third quarter. The largest increases for the fourth quarter were in
consumer goods and automotive products; prices of imported
industrial supplies and capital goods declined slightly.
Prices of U.S. nonagricultural exports edged up in January, as
all major trade categories except capital goods posted price
increases. These increases were almost offset by a 1.7 percent
decrease in prices of computers, peripherals, and semi-conductors.
Prices of U.S. agricultural exports rose 0.8 percent in January,
with a large increase in the price of soybeans.
In the fourth quarter, prices of U.S. exports declined 1.0
percent at an annual rate. Prices of nonagricultural products fell
at an annual rate of 0.8 percent. Prices of agricultural products
declined for the fourth consecutive quarter.

The widening of the deficit in the fourth quarter primarily
reflected declines in net service receipts (from an unusually strong
third-quarter level) and net investment income receipts. In
addition, payments of U.S. government grants (part of unilateral
transfers) increased, largely reflecting payments made to Israel.
Net receipts from services had been boosted more than $11
billion at an annual rate in the third quarter by insurance payments
recovered from foreign reinsurers for damage caused by hurricanes

Andrew and Iniki. Net insurance payments fell to normal levels in
the fourth quarter. For other services, increases in receipts from
foreigners traveling in the United States were offset by small
declines in other categories.
Investment income receipts fell at an annual rate of $7 billion
in the fourth quarter. Direct investment receipts accounted for
two-thirds of this decline as the earnings of U.S. companies abroad
continued to fall in depressed foreign markets. A fall in U.S.
government receipts from unusually strong third-quarter levels
accounted for the remainder of the decline in investment income
receipts. The rescheduling of Peruvian arrears had boosted
third-quarter government receipts: there was also a decline in
income from military loans. Portfolio investment payments picked up
in the fourth quarter as semi-annual coupon payments were made on a
large amount of U.S. bonds purchased in the second quarter of 1992.
For 1992 as a whole, the U.S. current account deficit was
nearly $60 billion larger than in 1991. Cash contributions from
coalition partners in Operation Desert Storm amounting to $43
billion held down the current account deficit in 1991. Excluding
special grants, the current account deficit widened $23 billion
between 1991 and 1992. The merchandise trade deficit weakened and
net investment income receipts declined; an increase in net receipts
from service transactions only partly offset these movements.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
U.S. international financial transactions in December and
January were marked by continued outflows through banking
transactions and U.S. purchases of foreign securities. Private
foreign purchases of U.S. securities slowed in January, but this
slowing was offset by large inflows of official reserves.

Banks in the United States reported a $4 billion outflow in
December, which accelerated to $8-1/2 billion in January. (See line
1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.) The
outflow in December was entirely attributable to U.S. chartered
banks, which increased claims on their own foreign offices. Foreign
chartered banks on net borrowed from their affiliates abroad during
December to finance asset growth near year-end. In early January,
however, foreign chartered banks began reducing their assets in the
United States and by mid-month began reducing their net liabilities
to affiliates abroad. Assets and net liabilities to affiliates
continued to decline through February. (See line 1b of the
International Banking Table.)
Private foreigners continued to add to their holdings of U.S.
Treasury securities in December and January. despite very large
purchases at November's mid-quarter refunding (line 3). For the
fourth quarter, net purchases totaled $21-1/2 billion. Foreign
purchases of U.S. government agency bonds were also brisk in the
fourth quarter, more than $6 billion, bringing net purchases of
corporate and agency bonds to $8-1/2 billion (line 2a). The pace of
net corporate and agency bond purchases fell off a bit in January,
but still remained near $2 billion, as new issue activity in
general, and Eurobond issuance in particular, remained at high
levels. Foreign net purchases of U.S. stocks also increased in
December, bringing total net purchases for the quarter to $4 billion
(line 2b). Small net sales were recorded for January.
U.S. residents' purchases of foreign stocks and bonds
accelerated to $7 billion in December and remained near that level
in January (line 2c). Stocks, in both Europe and Asia. accounted
for most of the net purchases in December. In January, stocks in
Asia and bonds in Europe accounted for most of the purchases.

Fcreign official reserve holdings in the United States rose
$3-1/2 billion in December and another $13 billion in January
(line 4). In December, large increases by Germany, Switzerland, and
Canada were partially offset by declines in reserve holdings by the
United Kingdom, Italy, and Taiwan. In January, large increases were
recorded for Germany. Spain, and Singapore. The increase in German
dollar reserves likely reflects the repayment of loans made during
September and October under the Very Short Term Financing Facility
of the European Monetary Cooperation Fund. These loans are due
forty-five days after the end of the month in which they are drawn
and can be repaid in currencies other than that in which they are
drawn. Partial data from the FRBNY indicate official reserves held
in the United States rose $5-1/2 billion in February. Reserves
held by Germany fell while those held by the Netherlands. Spain,
Singapore, and Argentina rose.
Data for direct investment capital flows in the fourth quarter
indicate a $9 billion increase in U.S. direct investment abroad
(line 6). Most of the outflow was to Canada, Latin America, and
Asia. Foreign direct investors reduced their position in the United
States by $3 billion in the quarter (line 7). Substantial new
equity inflows were more than offset by negative reinvested earnings
and net outflows through intercompany debt transactions.
The statistical discrepancy was a positive $8 billion in the
fourth quarter, down substantially from the $15 billion recorded in
the third quarter (line 10). Reduced net currency shipments to
foreigners accounted for part of this decline.

intermeeting period. The dollar declined from mid-February, partly
in response to data suggesting some slowing in the pace of U.S.
economic expansion, and partly in response to the decline in long-
term interest rates associated with the Clinton Administration's
fiscal program. In early March. however, the release of labor
market statistics that were far stronger than expected and the
release of disappointing inflation data, provided the dollar with a
substantial boost.
The dollar posted a net gain of 1-1/4 percent against the mark
over the intermeeting period. The dollar's fluctuations against the
mark and other European currencies were mostly driven by changes in
expectations about the pace of future Bundesbank easing. Early in
February, the Bundesbank surprised the market by cutting the
discount rate 25 basis points to 8 percent and the Lombard rate 50
basis points to 9 percent. The dollar initially rose following this
action, but the mark rebounded in mid-February as it became apparent
that the Bundesbank would only allow market rates to slip slightly
following its cut in official rates. In late February, the mark
began to decline on the perception that the Bundesbank would yield
to pressures from the United States and Europe to allow rates to
fall further. In early March the Bundesbank announced that its
regular two-week RP on March 10 would be at a fixed rate. 1/4
percentage point below the rate of its previous two-week RP. Market
participants interpreted this as a signal of an easier monetary
stance by the Bundesbank. Three-month interest rates in Germany
declined 70 basis points during the period. Three-month rates in
other major European countries declined 30 to 100 basis points.
Challenges to Boris Yeltsin's power by the Congress of People's
Deputies, and the prospect of further political instability in

IV-14
Russia. appeared to contribute modestly to the dollar's appreciation
against the mark towards the end of the period.
Between early February and mid-March, the dollar reached a new
all-time low against the yen before recovering somewhat to post a
net decline of 6-1/4 percent. The main focus of attention for the
yen was whether Japan's trading partners would push for yen
appreciation in an effort to limit Japan's trade surplus. Several
remarks by prominent U.S. and European officials that advocated yen
strengthening contributed to the yen's rise and led some market
participants to expect that the G-7 would reach an agreement to
strengthen the yen. In the period around the G-7 meeting on
February 28. the dollar rebounded from its lows against the yen as
U.S. and Japanese officials reiterated that exchange rate policy
would not be used to reduce Japan's trade surplus.
On February 4, the Bank of Japan lowered its official discount
rate 3/4 of a percentage point to 2-1/2 percent. A rate decline of
this magnitude had already been anticipated by the market, and the
cut had virtually no effect on financial markets during the
intermeeting period.
Bond and equity markets rallied in most of Europe and Japan
during the intermeeting period. The perception that interest rates
in Germany are likely to come down sooner and by more than had been
previously expected contributed to the bond market rally in Europe.
In Japan and in most European countries long-term interest rates
came down 30 to 70 basis points. During the period equity markets
rose 3 to 8 percent in many European countries, and rose by more in
France and Sweden.
Exchange rate pressures reemerged for the Spanish and
Portuguese currencies during the period on the perception that the
existing parity arrangements may not be sustainable in light of

IV-15
continued economic weakness in Spain, and high interest rates in
Germany. The pressures on these currencies were reduced, but not
eliminated, by the declines in German interest rates during the
period. The French franc came under intermittent pressure during
the period: this pressure increased towards the end of the period
ahead of the upcoming French election on March 21. The Belgian
franc also encountered moderate exchange rate pressure during the
period as a result of political uncertainty surrounding the Belgian
parliament's vote to reorganize Belgium as a federal state.
The Italian lira declined about 4 percent against the mark
during the period. A widening government corruption scandal, which
has called the viability of the current governing coalition into
question, has contributed to the lira's decline.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
The level of activity in the major foreign industrialized
economies slowed further in the fourth quarter, and domestic demand
remained weak. GDP contracted in Japan, western Germany, and
France, and it grew slowly in the United Kingdom. An acceleration
in activity in Canada was entirely export driven. Available data
for the current quarter have been generally negative for Japan and
France, but more mixed for western Germany. There have been more
positive signs in the United Kingdom and Canada that suggest
recovery may be taking hold.
Special factors have increased measured inflation rates in some
countries, although they have generally remained low. Pass-through
effects from last year's currency depreciation have affected some

IV-16
price measures in Italy, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Recent tax
increases are boosting west German and French inflation in early
1993.
National elections will be held in France on Sunday. March 21.
with run-off elections to follow on March 28. In Canada, the
Progressive Conservative Party will choose a new Prime Minister on
June 13 to lead the party in a general election that must be called
by November.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, real GDP slipped 0.3
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter, its third consecutive
quarterly decline. Private final domestic demand dropped 5.6
percent (s.a.a.r.). as consumption decreased 2.2 percent and private
investment expenditure plummeted. However, net exports, public
infrastructure spending, and inventory investment made positive
contributions to growth.
Preliminary indicators of activity in the first quarter suggest
further weakness. In January, industrial production (s.a.)
decreased 0.3 percent, housing starts (s.a.) dropped 1.2 percent,
and retail sales registered a 12-month decline of 3 percent. New
passenger car registrations (s.a.) rose 1.5 percent in February, but
were still 5.4 percent below their year-earlier level. Although
machinery orders (s.a.) increased for the third consecutive month in
January, they were down 10.4 percent from January 1992.
The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey of major manufacturing firms
reported a further deterioration in business sentiment in the
current quarter. The percent balance having a favorable view of
business conditions declined from -44 to -49. the lowest level since
August 1975. On average, firms predicted a 5.9 percent drop in
investment in the current fiscal year and a further 4.2 percent
decline in investment in the fiscal year that begins April 1.

Inflation pressures have remained low. Consumer prices in the
Tokyo area (n.s.a.) rose 0.1 percent in February, and their
twelve-month increase was only 1.2 percent. Excluding perishable
food prices, the CPI was up 1.5 percent over this period.
The trade surplus (s.a.a.r.) for January and February combined
was $120 billion, about unchanged from the fourth quarter.
On March 6, the lower house of the parliament approved the
government's proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins next
month. The new budget provides no fiscal stimulus, but a
supplementary fiscal package containing significant spending
increases is widely expected.
Real GDP in western Germany dropped 3.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
the fourth quarter, its third consecutive quarterly decrease.
However, total domestic demand (s.a.a.r.) reversed a two-quarter
decline, expanding 3.2 percent, as a sharp drop in equipment
investment was more than offset by a 5.6 percent surge in
consumption induced by the January increase in the value-added tax.
The external sector made a large negative contribution to growth.
Exports (including exports to eastern Germany) declined and imports
increased.
Other recent indicators are consistent with continued weakness
in west German activity. Industrial production (s.a.) has trended

IV-21
down since early last year, but increased 0.4 percent in January
relative to the fourth quarter. After plunging 7-1/2 percent in the
fourth quarter, manufacturing orders (s.a.) increased almost 1
percent in January from their fourth-quarter average. In February,
the unemployment rate rose from 7.5 percent to 7.7 percent, but it
is still low by historical standards. Business confidence in
January remained at a level typical of recessions.

Activity growth has been somewhat stronger in eastern Germany.
Industrial production expanded in September and October, but
declined slightly in November to a level 0.4 percent below where it
stood a year ago. Preliminary GDP estimates indicate that east
German output grew 6.8 percent in 1992.
Decreasing inflationary pressures in western Germany have been
partially masked by a 1 percentage point increase in the value-added
tax that was implemented January 1. Consumer prices increased 4.2
percent in February on a year/year basis, up from the 4 percent
inflation registered in 1992. However, wholesale prices dropped 1.8
percent in the twelve months to February. Recent collective
bargaining settlements have led to wage increases in the 3 to 3-1/2
percent range. Engineering employers in the regions of Saxony and
Berlin-Brandenberg in eastern Germany recently abrogated contracts
negotiated last year that called for a 26 percent increase in

IV-22
nominal wages on April 1 and equalization of wages with those in
western Germany by 1994. East German workers have held public
demonstrations in protest of this move, and a strike appears
imminent
The pan-German current account deficit (s.a.) widened somewhat
in the fourth quarter, and it totalled $25.3 billion for the year.
about $6 billion larger than the 1991 deficit.
In January, German M3 fell far short of the Bundesbank's 1993
target growth range of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, declining 2.3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) relative to its base in the fourth quarter of 1992.
However. M3 increased 7.3 percent on a 12-month basis.
On March 14. the German federal government achieved an
agreement with state and local governments on fiscal policy as part
of Germany's "solidarity pact". The agreement proposes measures for
sharing the burden of financing annual transfers of about $70
billion to eastern Germany, and it includes the reinstatement of a
7-1/2 percent income surcharge in 1995. Another feature of the
"solidarity pact" is the recent moderation in wage increases.
France appears to be following Germany into recession. In the
fourth quarter. GDP (s.a.a.r.) fell 1.2 percent, as exports dropped
5.6 percent, fixed investment slipped 4.4 percent, and inventory
accumulation decelerated. Consumption (s.a.a.r.) rose 2.8 percent.
but in January, consumption of manufactured products (s.a.) about
one third of total consumption, fell slightly below the
fourth-quarter average. Unemployment remained steady in January at
10.5 percent (s.a.).
The Bank of France's January business survey pointed to a
further decline in industrial production and a decrease in factory
orders, but a February survey suggested that production may have

IV-23
stabilized. An INSEE survey of capital expenditure intentions
indicated that firms plan to reduce investment 3 percent this year,
Inflation continues to be moderate. The 12-month increase in
consumer prices in February was 2.1 percent, the same as in January.
Hourly wages in January stood 3.6 percent above their year-earlier
level, down from a 3.8 percent increase in October.
National elections scheduled for March 21 are expected to
result in the accession of a center-right coalition. The leaders of
this bloc -- Jacques Chirac of the Gaullist party and Giscard
d'Estaing of the UDF -- have announced a platform that includes
significant expansionary fiscal measures that would be phased in
over several years. Although the package would be financed in part
by expenditure cuts of roughly 1/2 percent of GDP and revenues from
privatization. it would increase the 1993 budget deficit
significantly above last year's shortfall of 3.2 percent of GDP.
Italy has been in recession since last.summer, and recent
indicators suggest continued weakness. A preliminary estimate of
industrial production in the fourth quarter is about 3 percent below
its 1991-Q4 level. In November, new orders dropped from their
year-earlier level for the fifth consecutive month. The consumer
confidence index (n.s.a.) declined 1.2 percent in December and
registered a cumulative drop of 14.4 percent during 1992.
The effects of last year's depreciation of the lira have begun
to show up in prices. The twelve-month change in the consumer price
index rose slightly to 4.4 percent in February, the first increase
in this measure of inflation since May 1992. In December, the
wholesale price index stood 4.3 percent above its year-earlier
level, after a 2.4 percent rise in November.
Since February 10. three cabinet members, including Finance
Minister Giovanni Goria, have resigned because of the fallout from

IV-24
the tangentopoli scandal. The scandal is related to kickbacks paid
by business to the parties in return for public contracts. A
national referendum will be held on April 18 if the Italian
Parliament has not enacted electoral reform legislation by that
time.
On balance, recent data indicate that a mild recovery is
underway in the United Kingdom. Real GDP grew 0.7 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter of 1992, after rising 1.1 percent
in the third quarter. Total domestic demand fell 1.3 percent
(s.a.a.r.). as fixed investment dropped 3.3 percent and inventory
destocking accelerated. However, consumption increased 1.0 percent.
and the external sector made a positive contribution to growth.
Exports were up 3.0 percent, and imports dropped 4.5 percent.
Available indicators for the first quarter show some promise
for further growth. In January, a sharp drop in oil output took
industrial production (s.a.) 0.6 percent below its fourth quarter
average. However, manufacturing production rose 0.8 percent.
Aggressive discounting helped retail sales (s.a.) in January and
February, taken together, to surge 1.4 percent from their fourth
quarter level. However, total unemployment (s.a.) rose for the 33rd
month in a row in January, and stood at 10.6 percent of the labor
force.
Soft demand and lower interest rates have contributed to recent
reductions in measured inflation. Retail prices (n.s.a.) fell 0.9
percent in January to a level 1.7 percent above a year earlier.
Excluding mortgage interest payments, retail prices (n.s.a.)
decreased 0.5 percent in January, lowering the twelve-month increase
from 3.7 percent to 3.2 percent. Sterling depreciation has
contributed to recent rises in the prices of firms' inputs and
outputs. In February, the cost of materials and fuel (n.s.a.) stood

IV-25
6.9 percent above the level of a year ago. Producers' prices
(n.s.a.) rose 0.4 percent in February and were up 3.7 percent from
February 1992.
Despite continued weakness in domestic demand, the trade
deficit (s.a.) has widened considerably in recent months. The
cumulative current account deficit for 1992 was $20.6 billion.
compared with a deficit of $10 billion in 1991.
On March 16, Chancellor Norman Lamont presented the 1993-94
budget to Parliament. The public sector borrowing requirement
(PSBR) is expected to rise to 50 billion pounds (8 percent of GDP)
from 35 billion pounds in the fiscal year that ends March 31.
Several tax increases were announced that will gradually reduce the
PSBR to 6 percent of GDP in the 1996-97 fiscal year. Lamont also
reiterated the government's pledge to keep underlying inflation

effective April 1.
President Boris Yeltsin and the anti-reform Congress of
People's Deputies (the highest political body) have been engaged in
a bitter power struggle. On March 12, the Congress activated three
constitutional amendments that undermine Yeltsin's authority. The
Congress also cancelled a referendum, previously scheduled for April
11, on the division of powers between the executive and legislative
branches of the Russian government. Yeltsin has vowed to poll
Russian voters, independently of the Congress, on how they wish to
be governed, but this poll would have no legal validity.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Mexico recorded a trade deficit of $15.8 billion in 1992
compared with a deficit of $6.9 billion in 1991. Interest rates
have apparently been high enough to induce capital inflows and allow
the peso/dollar exchange rate to remain roughly stable since early
January. Economic activity in Korea and Taiwan has continued to
slow and industrial output in Argentina experienced no growth over
the second half of 1992. Inflation declined in Korea. Mexico, and
Argentina, and remained low and stable in Taiwan. In Brazil,
economic activity remains depressed, and inflation has been high.
reflecting deepening pessimism about the prospects for fiscal and
monetary reform. Disputes between the economic team and President
Franco over economic policies resulted in the resignation of the
finance minister and central bank president in early March.
Individual country notes. Mexico's merchandise trade deficit
in 1992 was $15.8 billion, up from $6.9 billion in 1991. The growth
of manufactured exports slowed while import growth increased;
imports were 26 percent higher, while manufactured exports, which
accounted for about two-thirds of total exports, were only 7 percent
higher. Petroleum exports were less than 2 percent higher, and
other exports were lower. The current account deficit is estimated
to have been roughly $23 billion (9 percent of GDP) in 1992, up from
$13.3 billion (5.4 percent of GDP) in 1991.
Interest rates have apparently been high enough to induce
capital inflows and allow the peso/dollar exchange rate to remain
roughly stable since early January. On March 16. the exchange rate
was 3.1175 new pesos per dollar. 3.1 percent above the gradually
depreciating lower limit of its fluctuation band. In response to an
unexpectedly high increase in the CPI for the first half of January.
the Bank of Mexico tightened policy in mid-January. As a result.

interest rates, which had been declining since mid-October, turned
up through early March. However, after the monthly increase in the
CPI declined from 1.3 percent in January to 0.8 percent in February.
monetary policy eased: at the March 16 auction, the twenty-eight-day
Treasury-bill rate was 17.3 percent, down 70 basis points from two
weeks earlier but still 79 basis points above the mid-January low.
The February CPI was 10.9 percent higher than a year earlier. This
compares with a 17.2 percent increase in the previous twelve months.
Real GNP growth in Taiwan fell to 6.1 percent in 1992 from 7.3
percent in 1991. as recovering domestic investment failed to
compensate fully for declining net exports. Both private and public
investment grew by roughly 17.5 percent in 1992. Although
government investment grew faster last year than it had in four
years, growth was below initial targets and reflected delays in
implementing Taiwan's six-year. $300 billion infrastructure program.
The cumulative merchandise trade surplus through February was
$500 million, down from the trade surplus of $1.3 billion over the
same period in 1992. Cumulative exports through February were 4.5
percent higher than a year earlier, and imports through February
were 12.6 percent higher than a year earlier.
Consumer price inflation in January was 3.6 percent (year-over-
year), consistent with recent trends once price increases from past
weather shocks are accounted for.
After more than a month of negotiations. Taiwan's President Lee
Teng-hui secured approval from the ruling Kuomintang Party for a new
Premier and cabinet in late February. The move further consolidates
executive power into the hands of politicians with ethnic roots in
Taiwan, rather than from mainland China. Taiwan's stock market
reacted to the nomination of a new Premier by rising 28 percent

through March 12, more than making up for losses that followed
December's legislative elections.
In Korea, economic activity has continued to slow.
Consequently, inflation has declined, and the trade deficit has
fallen. Industrial production fell 6.4 percent in January 1993 from
a year earlier, the largest decline in over 12 years. Some of this
decline was due to business closings for the Lunar New Year, which
fell in January this year, but in February last year. Consumer
prices were 4.6 percent higher in February than a year earlier, down
from a 7 percent increase in the previous twelve months. Korea's
cumulative trade deficit (on a customs clearance basis) for January
and February 1993 was $1.5 billion, down from a surplus of $3.1
billion over the same period last year. Cumulative exports through
February were 7 percent higher than a year earlier, and imports
through February were nearly 7 percent lower than a year earlier.
In Brazil, economic conditions remain depressed and inflation
has remained high. Real GDP fell by 0.9 percent in 1992, compared
with an increase of 0.9 percent in 1991. and would have declined
further had stimulative measures not been introduced in the fourth
quarter. Monthly inflation had been in the 20 to 25 percent range
since early 1992 and is expected to be 26 percent in March. The
trade surplus in January 1993 was $1.1 billion compared with a
surplus of $0.9 billion in January 1992.
Between late January and end-February. Brazil and the Bank
Advisory Committee (BAC) presented the $44 billion Brady-style
commercial bank restructuring package to bank creditors. On
March 16. Brazil announced that over 95 percent of the banks had
indicated their selections among the options, with a large portion
of the debt being allocated toward the par bonds. However,
implementation of the bank package is not expected until Brazil

either agrees to finance the full amount of the collateral needed
for the par and discount bonds or qualifies for financing from the
IMF and other multilateral institutions, Brazil is in non-
compliance with the fiscal targets contained in its January 1992
IMF stand-by arrangement.
The dim prospects for fiscal and monetary reform were
underscored in early March, when Finance Minister Paulo Haddad and
Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola resigned, citing their
opposition to President Franco's selection of political appointees
to technical posts at the central bank. Franco advocates reducing
interest rates to stimulate the economy and had criticized the
economic team for not moving more quickly to put an end to high
inflation, which he blames on "oligopolistic forces." Franco
selected Eliseu Resende to be the new finance minister and Paulo
Cesar Ximenes to be the new central bank president. (Ximenes'
nomination must be confirmed by the senate.) Speculation has
intensified over the past few months that a new program will be
implemented that will include wage and price freezes and a forced
conversion of short-term internal debt into long-term debt.
In Argentina. April Ist marks the second anniversary of the
Convertibility Law, which established a fixed one-to-one exchange
rate between the peso and the U.S. dollar. The CPI rose by 0.7
percent during February. with a cumulative increase of 4.5 percent
over the past six months compared with an increase of 9,4 percent
over the six months ending in February 1992. The real exchange rate
against the dollar has appreciated by about 25 percent over the past
two years. After rapid growth during the first half of 1992. the
industrial sector has experienced no growth during the past eight
months. The official unemployment rate has risen slightly over the
period and was 6.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992. Prelim-

inary data indicate that merchandise imports fell to $900 million
per month during January and February 1993. compared with a peak of
$1.3 billion in October 1992. (Data on export revenues in 1993 are
not available yet.)
Argentina and its bank advisory committee have announced that
the Brady-style debt restructuring agreement will be implemented on
April 7. More than 99 percent of Argentina's commercial bank
creditors have agreed to the restructuring package.
