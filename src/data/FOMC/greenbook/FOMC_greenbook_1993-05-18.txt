Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Reading through the distortions caused by the late-winter
blizzard, economic activity appears to have expanded sluggishly in
recent months. Payroll employment rose only slightly, on net, over
March and April, as did industrial production. Among the components
of final demand, equipment spending has displayed the most notable
vigor. However, the advance report on retail sales in April
indicates that--despite a healthy jump in auto purchases--consumer
spending has remained sluggish. Inventories rose appreciably in the
first quarter, and although significant imbalances are not evident
at this juncture, inventory investment likely will decline this
quarter. Despite the considerable slack in the economy, recent wage
and price data, on the whole, suggest a stalling in the disinflation
trend.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor markets continue to improve, but at a slow pace. Nonfarm
payroll employment rose 119,000 in April after essentially no change
in March, and the civilian unemployment rate held at 7 percent.
Since the April survey week, initial claims for unemployment
insurance (adjusted for the emergency unemployment program) have
averaged around 380,000, a level that probably is consistent with
small gains in employment.
A rise of 151,000 in employment in the services industry--
reflecting continued strength in hiring in health and business
services--more than accounted for the April increase in payrolls.
Within business services, much of the job growth again came from
personnel supply firms, which have accounted for 44 percent of the
increase in total nonfarm employment since the trough of the

recession. In manufacturing, payrolls dropped 65,000 last
month; factory job losses were widespread, but were particularly
large at manufacturers of transportation equipment. Construction
employment failed to rebound from its weather-related decline in
March; reports suggest that wet weather continued to restrain hiring
in April. Other industries posted only small employment changes
last month.
At this point, the cumulative rise in nonfarm payroll
employment since March 1992 is estimated to have been 1.1 million;
between March 1991 and March 1992, employment was down 144,000. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) expects that next month's benchmark
revision will lower the March 1992 level only slightly (around
260,000).2 But, the BLS apparently has decided to incorporate an
upward adjustment to growth of payroll employment after March 1992.
As shown in the chart, employment data from the unemployment
insurance tax system tracked sample estimates from the payroll
report fairly closely through the first quarter of 1992. However,
employment growth, as measured by the UI data, far outpaced the
sample estimates from the payroll survey in the second quarter of
last year. Normally, the BLS would wait until next year's benchmark
(and the availability of all four quarters of UI data) to fold in
this potential discrepancy. But, in this case the BLS has decided
to apply a strong dose of judgment to their bias adjustment factors
1. Workers in personnel supply firms--including temporary
workers--account for about 1-1/2 percent of total nonfarm payrolls.
A special BLS survey conducted in 1987 indicated that about half of
all temporary workers were in administrative support jobs
(secretaries, typists, etc.) and about a quarter were in the
category of operators, fabricators, and laborers.
2. The data between March 1981 and March 1991 will be revised to
wedge in the noneconomic revision to employment that occurred in
January 1991 when payroll processing software was updated to
eliminate some overcounting of employment totals in quarterly UI
reports.

for the post-March 1992 period, adding some 300,000 to estimated job
growth over that period.
In the household survey, employment declined 149,000 in April,
after small gains in the first quarter. Weak employment prospects
may have damped labor-force entry, and the participation rate edged
down in April to a level 0.4 percentage point below its 1992
average. The number of individuals working part time for economic
reasons rose sharply in April and, on balance, has remained at a
relatively high level over the past year.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector was essentially
unchanged in the first quarter--the weakest reading since the
expansion began--after a jump of 4.1 percent at an annual rate in
the fourth quarter. In part, this pattern reflects swings in hours
of self-employed workers. Since the cyclical trough in the first
quarter of 1991, productivity has increased at an annual rate of
2.3 percent, a little less than that averaged during the first two
years of previous expansions, but substantially above gains in
recent years.
Industrial Production
RESTRICTED UNTIL THE G.17 RELEASE AT 9:15 AM ON FRIDAY, MAY 14
Total industrial production was little changed in March and
April, after having posted average monthly gains of about
1/2 percent between September and February. Part of the recent
weakness in the index reflects a decline in utility output,
following a weather-related runup in February. The rise in
manufacturing output of 1/4 percent, on average, in March and April
also dropped below its earlier pace, apparently responding to the
slower pace of final sales in recent months.
Production of consumer goods other than motor vehicles slowed
on balance in March and April after a weakening in orders for such

II-8
items as household appliances and consumer electronics during the
first quarter. Except for the ongoing strength in the computer
industry, production of business equipment has been little changed
in recent months; declines in production of civilian aircraft remain
a noticeable drag.
Motor vehicle assemblies edged down in March and a bit further
in April. With the pickup in domestic light-vehicle sales in April,
dealers' inventories of both autos and light trucks fell to a more
comfortable seventy days' supply at month-end. According to current
schedules, motor vehicle production will hold at a 10.9 million unit
annual rate in May and then decline in June to a 10.5 million unit
pace. These schedules can accommodate some reduction in sales from
the high April pace without causing the days' supply of vehicles to
drift back above the seventy-day mark.

Mining output increased 0.8 percent in April. Coal production,
which was held down in March by the winter storm, bounced back in
April; the recent hit-and-run strikes by the United Mine Workers'
Union are expected to have a limited depressing effect on coal
output in May. Looking beyond the short-term movements, mining
output has been trending down since 1990, in large part the result

II-9
of the ongoing reductions in oil and gas extraction. With regard to
utilities, output accelerated over the course of 1992, and the
recent wiggles are weather-related gyrations around an upward trend.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal retail sales rose 1.2 percent in April, reversing the
weather-induced drop in March. Abstracting from weather effects,
consumption spending has been lackluster so far this year, after a
burst of outlays in the latter part of 1992. This downshift in
consumption growth likely reflects the slow advance in after-tax
income and the deterioration in consumer sentiment in the first
quarter regarding future economic conditions.
According to the data for April, spending in the retail control
category--which the BEA uses to estimate personal consumption
expenditures for goods other than motor vehicles--advanced
0.7 percent, reversing a little less than half of the March decline
in real terms. These data suggest that the April level of real PCE
for goods excluding motor vehicles was a bit below the average level
in the first quarter.
The latest information for sales of new cars and light trucks
is more favorable. Total light vehicle sales rose to a 14.2 million
unit annual rate in April, up considerably from the 13.1 million
unit pace in March. A portion of the robust sales in April probably
represents purchases that had been delayed by the bad weather in
late February and the first twenty days of March. Cutting through
the shorter-term fluctuations, sales of light vehicles have been on
a mild uptrend since early 1992.3
3. Vehicles with domestic nameplates have accounted for the
entire increase in sales of autos and light trucks since last fall.
Evidently, the price increases announced for many foreign models
this year have restrained demand for these vehicles.

Labor income has been quite sluggish this year. In real terms,
wages and salaries actually fell slightly between December and
March, after rising at more than a 6 percent annual pace over the
preceding three months. To be sure, this deceleration is
exaggerated by special factors that boosted the December level of
income-notably, a jump in bonuses in the securities industry.
Nonetheless, after removing the unusual bonuses, real wages and
salaries rose at an annual rate of only 1-1/2 percent between
December and March, and the employment report for April suggests
little change from this pace.
Total real disposable income has advanced more rapidly in
recent months than wages and salaries alone, but the relative
strength has largely reflected a transitory jump in farm subsidy
payments. Because such income probably is not spent immediately,
this bulge in subsidies explains much of the reported rise in the
personal saving rate to 5.4 percent in March from the 4-1/2 percent
level that prevailed during the preceding five months.
As indicated below in the discussion of federal sector
developments, several factors have affected the timing of personal
tax payments over the past year. Of these factors, the 1992 change
in tax withholding schedules likely has been the most important for
consumer spending. Because of the reduction in withholding, many
households either received smaller refunds than usual or faced
outstanding tax bills this spring. Some of these households--
particularly those with limited financial resources--likely spent
part of the extra income in 1992 and curtailed their spending

somewhat early this year when confronted with the larger taxes
owed .
Coinciding with the weakness in after-tax income and spending,
both the Michigan and the Conference Board surveys showed
substantial deterioration in consumer sentiment from December to
March. Most of the first-quarter decline in both indexes was the
result of a fading of post-election optimism about near-term future
economic conditions. In April, the Conference Board index turned
up, reversing about one-third of its decline since December, while
the Michigan index was essentially unchanged.
Housing Markets
Total housing starts declined 4.6 percent in March, to
1.13 million units at an annual rate; for the first quarter as a
whole, total starts were 6.5 percent below their fourth-quarter
average, reflecting declines in both the single-family and
multifamily sectors. Issuance of building permits also fell in the
first quarter.
Housing construction probably was curtailed, in part, by the
unusually bad weather in March throughout much of the nation. On a
regional basis, total housing starts declined 27 percent in the
Northeast, 14 percent in the Midwest, and 5 percent in the South;
all three of these regions experienced abnormally cold and wet
weather in March. Starts rose 18 percent in the West, where the
weather was favorable.
4. The other significant change in the timing of personal tax
payments was the surge in estimated tax payments around year-end and
the corresponding weakness in final payments in recent months. This
timing shift was concentrated among financially sophisticated
households, some of whom were taking actions to minimize their tax
burdens. These households are unlikely to have altered the time
pattern of their consumption as a result of such tax-minimization
strategies.

In addition, this winter's surge in lumber prices evidently cut
into homebuilding in recent months; tightened environmental
regulations created uncertainties about timber supplies and resulted
in panic buying. Currently available data suggest that, at least
initially, these cost increases were largely absorbed in builders'
profit margins; in particular, new home prices, adjusted for changes
in geographic composition, structural characteristics, and seasonal
variation, edged down in the first quarter. The apparent inability
to pass the costs on to buyers reflected not only the underlying
demand conditions but also, according to builders and bankers, a
reluctance of appraisers (working from "comparables") to add on the
higher costs in determining valuations for mortgage loans. Lumber
prices rank far above other concerns in recent surveys of builders.
Although reports also indicate shortages of buildable lots, related
in part to the limited supply of credit for land acquisition and
development, this problem has been emphasized by a relatively small
fraction of builders.
Several factors suggest that construction of single-family
homes is likely to rebound in the second quarter. First, the spot
price of lumber fell sharply from an all-time high of $473 per
thousand board feet just before the last FOMC meeting to $278 in the
week ended May 7. The declines in recent weeks have reversed
virtually all of the run-up in prices earlier this year (chart).
Second, despite some backup in the past couple of weeks, mortgage
rates are close to their lowest levels in twenty years, making homes
affordable on a cash-flow basis to a broader spectrum of potential
buyers. Finally, the stock of new single-family homes for sale was
low in March, both in absolute terms and in comparison with sales,
and any future increase in demand likely will be accompanied by an
increase in homebuilding. Already, some evidence of a pickup in the

single-family market can be seen in data from the Mortgage Bankers
Association: The number of applications for loans to finance
purchases of new and existing homes, as seasonally adjusted by the
staff, rose 11 percent from late March to early May.
In contrast, in the multifamily sector, prospects for a near-
term pickup from the depressed conditions prevailing in the first
quarter are dim. Multifamily starts continued to be impeded by a
persistent oversupply of rental apartments and the resulting
restraint on rents. The vacancy rate for multifamily rental
properties jumped to 10 percent in the first quarter, compared with
9.4 percent a year earlier.
Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment continued to trend up in the first
quarter, driven by another sizable rise in equipment outlays.
Advance indicators point to further gains in equipment spending over
the near term and to continued lethargy in nonresidential
construction.
The growth in real equipment outlays last quarter was paced by
another sharp increase in spending for computing equipment, which
has nearly doubled over the past two years. Firms have continued to
take advantage of the sharp price reductions and enormous
improvements in performance offered by PCs and workstations. In
contrast, business spending for transportation equipment remained
lackluster in the first quarter. Within this category, the
continued uptrend in purchases of heavy trucks represents the only
area of strength; indeed, in response to the financial problems
besetting domestic carriers, outlays for aircraft edged down further
in the first quarter to a level almost 10 percent below the 1992
average. Real outlays for items other than computers and
transportation equipment are currently estimated by BEA to have

declined as well in the first quarter. However, the shipments of
these goods in March turned out to be stronger than BEA had assumed.
By our estimates, the new shipments data imply that real outlays for
this broad class of equipment likely posted a small rise in the
first quarter, continuing the uptrend that began in the second
quarter of 1992.
Looking ahead, the recent data on orders for nondefense capital
goods (excluding aircraft) point to further advances in equipment
spending in the near term. In particular, new orders for such
goods which lead shipments, on average, by a couple of months-
increased 5-1/2 percent in the first quarter; advances were
widespread across the various types of equipment.
With regard to nonresidential construction, outlays declined at
an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent last quarter. Office construction
continued to plunge, as this sector remains burdened by an overhang
of unoccupied space. In addition, drilling activity declined last
quarter, undoing the advance posted in the fourth quarter of last
year; as we had indicated, the fourth-quarter increase was spurred,
in large part, by the expiration at year-end of a tax incentive for
natural gas. Elsewhere, spending for "other commercial" structures
posted its second consecutive quarterly increase, and activity in
the public utilities sector continued to trend up, owing mainly to
capacity expansion at electric utilities. Industrial construction,
which declined sharply last year, edged down a bit further in the
first quarter, reflecting the relatively low utilization rate in
manufacturing. For nonresidential structures as a whole, the recent
data on contracts and permits are mixed, but suggest, on balance,
that the bottom has been reached in this sector or is close at hand.

1. Ratio of end of period inventories to average monthly sales for the period.

II-25
Business Inventories
According to BEA's advance estimate, nonfarm businesses
accumulated inventories at a fairly rapid pace in the first quarter.
That estimate was made without actual March data, but the figures
that have come in on manufacturers' and wholesalers' stocks have
validated BEA's assumptions of significant increases. Even so,
inventory-sales ratios in those sectors have remained relatively
low.
Manufacturing inventories expanded in both February and March,
ending a string of liquidations since early fall. A good part of
this accumulation likely was intended: Taking February and March
together, the bulk of the accumulation occurred in the durable-goods
sector, where shipments were strong and the inventory-shipments
ratio fell. Stocks held by producers of nonelectrical machinery
look particularly lean, judging by the sharp drop in the inventory-
sales ratios over the past six months for producers of both
computing equipment and industrial machinery. Moreover, the
appreciable rise in inventories at lumber and wood producers in
February and March probably reflected in large measure the runup in
lumber prices rather than an accumulation of physical stocks,
Wholesale inventories have been quite volatile of late, rising
appreciably in March, after a small drawdown in February. Despite
the sizable accumulation of stocks in March, the inventory-sales
ratio for the wholesale sector moved up only slightly, leaving the
March ratio at the low end of the range observed over the past two
years. In retail trade (excluding auto dealers), inventories rose
at a moderate pace during January and February, leaving the
inventory-sales ratio in the narrow range that had prevailed over
the preceding year. More recent data on non-auto retail stocks have

yet to be released, but anecdotal reports suggest that retailers,
for the most part, do not regard stocks as heavy.
Federal Sector
Recent information has mixed implications for the FY1993
federal deficit. On the one hand, monthly Treasury statements
through March suggested that this year's budget gap is likely to be
considerably smaller than the $322 billion estimated by 0MB in
April, reflecting strong tax collections during the first half of
FY1993 and restrained growth in spending. However, the anticipated
improvement has been tempered by the surprisingly low level of
nonwithheld tax payments in April and early May.
Daily Treasury Statements indicate that nonwithheld income and
social insurance tax collections from April 1 through May 6 were
only $58 billion, $12 billion lower than during the same period in
1992 (chart). During April and May, these collections mainly
represent final payments on the previous year's tax liability.
The apparent weakness in final payments contrasts with the robust
pace of estimated payments earlier this year. Much of the shift
from final payments to estimated payments likely reflects the
tightened safe-harbor provisions for estimated payments, which
boosted the last such payment on 1992 income, due January 15.
The weakness in final payments also stems, in part, from the
reduction in penalties this year for taxpayers who file for
5. Last year, final payments accounted for 80 percent of
nonwithheld tax collections in April and May.
6. In the past. the safe-harbor provisions provided that
penalties were not due so long as current-year tax payments
(withheld and estimated) were higher than the previous year's tax
liability. Now, for taxpayers whose "modified AGI" rises more than
$40,000 from the previous year, the rules have been tightened.
These taxpayers no longer can simply pay an amount that exceeds the
previous year's tax liability. To avoid penalties, tax payments
must exceed 90 percent of the current year's liability.

extensions without fully settling their tax bills.7 The reduced
penalties may have encouraged more taxpayers to wait until this
summer to make payment in full. Indeed, through the end of April
this year, 5.4 million taxpayers had filed for extensions, up from
the 4.7 million filings during the same period in 1992.
The weakness in receipts this spring would have been even
greater if not for the change in withholding schedules that took
effect in March of 1992. This change in the schedules lowered 1992
withholding by about $20 billion, but did not affect 1992 tax
liabilities. As a result, refunds to individuals through the first
week in May were about 6 percent below the comparable period in
1992, and final payments have received a boost from individuals
whose withholding fell short of their liabilities.
On the outlay side, spending during the first half of FY1993
was only 4.7 percent above that recorded during the same period a
year earlier (excluding outlays for deposit insurance and the
defense cooperation account). This rate of increase in outlays
represents a marked slowing from the 7.2 percent rise during the
first half of FY1992. Much of the deceleration has been in health
care--especially in Medicaid, for which outlays had surged over the
preceding few years; in part, the slowing appears to stem from
regulations issued in 1992 that limit the ability of states to shift
Medicaid costs to the federal government. Along with the welcome
news on Medicaid, growth in total federal outlays during the first
half of FY1993 also was restrained by reduced net interest outlays
and by a drop in defense spending. With the first-quarter plunge in
7. The Internal Revenue Service has permanently removed the major
penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes at the time of filing an
extension; this penalty was 5 percent of the tax liability for every
month of late filing, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the balance
due. Another penalty of 1/2 percent of the taxes due is still
applied each month of late filing. Also, 7 percent annual interest
is charged on late filings.

defense outlays, much of the total decline anticipated to occur over
FY1993 already has taken place, and the contraction during the rest
of the fiscal year is likely to be fairly small.
On the legislative front, the Congress passed a budget
resolution in early April that--while largely consistent with the
Clinton budget--calls for about $5 billion less spending in fiscal
year 1994. In addition, much of the Administration's proposed
stimulus package was derailed by a Republican Senate filibuster:
only a further extension of unemployment insurance became law. With
the Congress discussing a variety of modifications of the deficit-
reduction program, the fiscal outlook remains cloudy, and the
upcoming medical care proposal only compounds the uncertainty. In
all likelihood, this uncertainty has contributed to the recent
weakening of consumer and business confidence.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local
governments were essentially flat in the first quarter and have not
changed, on net, since the first quarter of 1992. Construction
outlays have been the weakest component of purchases throughout this
period, including the first quarter. Real spending on
compensation of state and local workers advanced at a modest pace in
the first quarter, roughly in line with the small gains in
employment. In April, state and local government employment
continued to increase fairly slowly.
During the first quarter, the deficit of operating and capital
accounts appears to have widened somewhat. However, recent
information from the states suggests that their receipts improved in
8. The March data on construction, which were not available in
time for the advance GDP report, suggest a slightly bigger drop than
BEA's current estimate of a 4-3/4 percent (annual rate) decline in
real state and local construction spending in the first quarter.

the first quarter. In January and February, revenues were at or
above projections in all but four states (chart). A preliminary
count of revenues indicates that state tax collections were up about
6 percent over the year ended in the first quarter. The increase
matched that over the four quarters of 1992, which--when adjusted
for legislated tax changes and inflation--was the first advance in
at least two years. The improvement has been especially noticeable
in personal income tax payments, which were up 9 percent in the
first quarter from their year-earlier level. One reason may be that
many high-income individuals accelerated declarations into 1992 (and
paid estimated taxes in early 1993) in anticipation of increased
federal income tax rates.
Prices
Recent price data suggest that the underlying rate of price
inflation has leveled off. In April, the CPI excluding food and
energy rose 0.4 percent, after an increase of 0.1 percent in March.
Although these increases were less, on average, than the out-sized
figures for January and February, the twelve-month change in the CPI
excluding food and energy was 3.5 percent in April, roughly the pace
that has prevailed since last summer.
Among the components of consumer prices, food prices rose
0.4 percent in April, after increases of only 0.1 percent in both
February and March. Meat prices rose further in April, extending
the fairly sharp upswing that began around the start of the year.
The production of beef and pork has fallen short of expectations so
far in 1993, but is expected to pick up again as the year
progresses. In addition, the price of fresh vegetables turned up
sharply in April, reflecting weather-related supply disruptions
earlier in the year. Apart from meats and fresh produce, food price

increases at retail have continued to be quite small so far this
year--less than 0.2 percent per month, on average.
Consumer energy prices were up 0.2 percent in April, as
increases in the prices of electricity and natural gas were
partially offset by a decline in gasoline prices. Despite ups and
downs, gasoline prices have changed little from the beginning of the
year; private survey data suggest that retail gasoline prices moved
higher in early May on a seasonally adjusted basis. Residential
natural gas prices rose 1.0 percent in April--on top of a
1.4 percent increase in March- as higher prices at the wellhead were
passed through to consumers. Spot and futures prices for natural
gas surged between late March and late April and have remained, on
balance, at elevated levels. In large part, this surge stemmed from
efforts to rebuild stocks after the stretch of colder-than-usual
weather at the end of the winter. But longer-term factors also have
had some influence. In particular, several pieces of legislation in
recent years have mandated the use of cleaner-burning fuels, which
likely will boost demand for natural gas over the longer haul. At
the same time, exploratory drilling for new natural gas has been
depressed by the extended period of very low prices.
For goods other than food and energy, prices rose 0.3 percent
in April, pushed up by increases in prices of tobacco and motor
vehicles. Prices of passenger cars and light trucks both increased
0.5 percent; however, for the twelve months ending in April, car
prices are up just 2-1/4 percent, while light truck prices increased
3 percent. Looking ahead, Philip Morris recently announced plans to
reduce the price of Marlboro cigarettes by about 20 percent to fight
"generic" brands that have been gaining market share; the price cuts
went into effect with a lag and should begin to show up in the May

9CPI report. Manufacturers of some other brand-name consumer
products appear to be facing similar pressures from generic brands,
a factor that could help hold down the CPI in coming months.
Prices of nonenergy services were up 0.4 percent in April,
after an advance of 0.2 percent in March. Shelter prices jumped
0.5 percent last month, boosted by a sizable increase in owners
equivalent rent. Although airfares declined in March and April--
reflecting some discounting of summertime fares--the price of
medical services rose 0.7 percent in April, after a very small
increase in March.
Turning to the broader category of medical care--which includes
both services and commodities--prices have decelerated substantially
since 1990 (chart). Of course, the pace of inflation in medical
care prices has been much higher than that for overall prices for
some time; medical care prices have risen at an average annual pace
of 7.3 percent since 1984, compared with an average inflation rate
of 3.6 percent for the CPI excluding medical care over this period.
The lower panel of the chart splits medical care into its components
for services and commodities.10 The pattern of increases in these
categories was fairly similar through 1991; however, beginning last
year, the rate of deceleration in the two categories diverged. The
sharp slowing that has occurred in the commodities index since last
spring may represent increased competition as well as a response by
9. Given Marlboro's market share of nearly 25 percent, these
price cuts could reduce the total CPI by 0.1 percentage point.
However, Philip Morris is cutting prices through a variety of
channels, including coupons and promotional merchandise tie-ins.
The in-store coupons will be reflected in the CPI, but the tie-ins
will not. Note that because of the sampling procedures used for the
CPI, the effect of the price reductions likely will be spread over a
few months.
10. Commodities--mostly prescription drugs--make up less than
20 percent of the total medical care category.

drug companies to the national focus on prescription drug
11prices.
In addition to the recent unfavorable news on consumer prices,
the PPI for finished goods other than food and energy also was up
0.4 percent in April, although the increase was concentrated in two
items: tobacco and passenger cars. Tobacco prices rose a hefty
1.4 percent, reflecting higher prices for both generic and premium
brands of cigarettes. Producer prices of passenger cars increased
1.1 percent in April, partly reflecting problems with seasonal
adjustment in the PPI and the timing of incentives over the
12year. Prices of capital goods rose 0.2 percent in both March
and April, after a larger increase in February. Computer prices,
which dropped 15 percent over the year ended in April, have
continued to temper the rise in the total PPI for capital goods.
Nonetheless, even excluding computers, prices of prices of other
capital goods rose just 2 percent during the twelve months ended in
February, about 1-1/4 percentage points below the year-earlier pace.
Spot prices of industrial materials have dropped back, on
balance, since the last Greenbook. The Journal of Commerce index of
industrial materials prices has declined 4-1/2 percent since the
middle of March, and its metals subcomponent has fallen about
2-3/4 percent over this period (table). Part of this decline
reflects the plunge in lumber prices, after the spike earlier in the
year; however, prices of many other industrial materials have
dropped back as well. By contrast, prices of precious metals have
11. The CPI's measure of prescription drug prices only covers
drugs purchased directly by consumers at retail outlets and by mail
order. Hence, discounts received by HMOs and other groups would not
be captured in the CPI.
12. In this model year, incentives were put in place earlier than
usual. And, in recent months, incentives were not sweetened as much
as expected by the seasonal factors, contributing to some sizable
monthly increases on a seasonally adjusted basis. Passenger car
prices were up only 0.3 percent before seasonal adjustment.

moved up. Gold prices have risen more than 5 percent in the past
four weeks, and silver and platinum prices are up as well. By and
large, analysts have cited increases in demand from other parts of
the world, along with political uncertainty, as explanations for the
pickup; in general, analysts have not emphasized expectations of
higher inflation for the United States as the source of the runup in
gold prices.
Labor Costs
The deceleration in labor costs has stalled recently. With the
unemployment rate holding at or above 7 percent over the past year,
some ongoing deceleration in hourly compensation would have been
expected to occur. However, measured by the Employment Cost Index
(ECI), hourly compensation for private industry workers rose 4.2
percent at an annual rate over the December-to-March period, up from
an increase of 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992. This
first-quarter acceleration in hourly compensation was evident both
for wages and salaries and for benefits.13
Smoothing through the quarterly volatility, ECI hourly
compensation increased 3-1/2 percent over the year ended in March.
While down 3/4 percentage point from the year ended March 1992, this
twelve-month change has held steady for the past few quarters. A
flattening is evident both for wages and salaries and for benefits,
and it is widespread by industry and occupation as well. The same
pattern appears in the data on average hourly earnings of production
or nonsupervisory workers: Over the year ended in April, average
13. Inflation in benefits costs jumped to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 7 percent in the first quarter. However, the source
of this acceleration is far from clear. Before seasonal adjustment,
there was a sharp rise in health-care costs in the first quarter.
But this year's bulge actually was smaller than that during the
first quarter of recent years and should have been filtered out by
the seasonal adjustment procedure. BLS has no explanation for the
source of the jump in the seasonally adjusted measure of benefits.

With regard to state and local government workers, the ECI for
compensation increased 3.6 percent over the year ended in March,
similar to the rise for private industry workers. The compensation
of state and local workers decelerated sharply over 1990 and 1991.
But, as with private industry workers, there has been no further
moderation in the growth of their labor costs in recent quarters.
By bargaining status, compensation increases for union workers
outpaced gains by nonunion workers in the first quarter, continuing
the pattern seen over the past couple of years. Nevertheless, on a
twelve-month change basis, compensation costs for union workers have
decelerated in recent quarters. This pattern is true for wages as
well: The ECI for wages and salaries for union workers increased
3 percent over the year ended in March, down from 3.4 percent over
the preceding twelve-month period.
Separate data on major union settlements (covering 1,000 or
more workers) also show continued deceleration in union wages. The
effective wage change series--which is the collective bargaining
series closest in concept to the ECI--rose 2.9 percent over the year
ended in March, down from the 3.5 percent increase over the previous
four quarters. New settlements in the first quarter called for wage

adjustments averaging 3.1 percent annually over the life of the
contract. This increase is similar to those posted in 1992
settlements and is less than that when the same parties bargained
two to three years ago. Compensation rate changes in new
settlements--for which data are collected only from contracts
covering 5,000 or more workers--also averaged 3.1 percent over the
life of the contract, slightly less than for contracts signed in
1992.
Although the unionized sector has shrunk over time, collective
bargaining data continue to provide useful information on wage
setting in certain sectors. Of particular note this year is the
triennial contract between the UAW and the Big Three automakers,
which covers some 600,000 workers; the agreement expires in
September. Also expiring later this year are agreements covering a
large number of workers in construction, steel, and state and local
governments. As has been the case in recent years, health insurance
costs--both for current employees and for retirees--are likely to be
a prominent issue in these upcoming negotiations.

Domestic Financial Developments
Short-term interest rates are little changed on balance since
the last FOMC meeting. Federal funds have continued to trade around
3 percent, and other short-term rates have remained in the narrow
zone that has prevailed since last summer. Long-term rates are up
about 10 basis points on net. Early in the intermeeting period, the
yield on the thirty-year Treasury bond rose almost 30 basis points,
with most of the movement owing to shifts in forward rates at
maturities beyond three years. This early spike likely was fueled
by concerns about a buildup in inflationary pressures, sparked by a
sharp increase in average hourly earnings and reinforced by some
pressure on commodity prices. Those fears subsided with a
subsequent string of more favorable price readings and indications
of a slowing in the pace of economic expansion, but the markets
showed signs of edginess about the uncertain fate of the deficit
reduction effort and were jolted most recently by adverse news on
consumer and producer prices.
Despite more favorable earnings reports than expected on
balance, stock price indexes were narrowly mixed: The NYSE
composite posted a small decline, while the NASDAQ rose 1 percent.
Bank stocks, in particular, were pummeled, with shares of money
center banks falling about 5 percent.
Public bond and equity issuance, while slowing from the pace
earlier in the year, remained heavy in April. Much of the proceeds
continued to be used to retire outstanding loans and securities, and
the growth rate of total business debt appeared to remain quite
sluggish. State and local government debt expanded at a moderate
rate, bolstered in part by heavy issuance of advance refunding
bonds. Household borrowing also appears to have remained moderate,
even though use of revolving debt seems to have picked up

considerably with the increase in aggressive rebate programs.
Private domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at about a 3-1/2 percent
annual rate from the fourth quarter through March, near the pace set
last year, while federal debt growth, at 9-1/2 percent, was somewhat
below last year's pace. Overall, the debt aggregate expanded at
about a 5 percent rate through the first quarter, placing it above
the lower bound of its monitoring range.
The broader monetary aggregates remained weak through April,
before surging in early May. Temporary factors continued to depress
M2 growth in March, had little net effect in April, but appear to be
spurring the rebound in early May. Abstracting from such
influences, the underlying growth in M2 since the fourth quarter has
been modest. Both M2 and M3 remain well below the lower bounds of
their target ranges.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 posted its fourth consecutive monthly decline in March. M2
velocity shot up at a 7 percent pace in the first quarter, even
though deposit rates relative to short-term market rates were about
unchanged. This was the largest quarterly increase in velocity
since the early 1980s, when binding deposit rate ceilings were
causing heavy outflows from deposits.
The weakness in M2 has continued to be mirrored by large net
inflows into bond and stock mutual funds. In March, these inflows
were near the record pace set in January, and April reportedly was
another strong month. Contributing to the strength of these inflows
have been the expanding efforts of banks in recent years to sell
mutual funds to retail customers. Results from a recent Senior
Financial Officer Survey indicate a rapidly growing availability of
mutual funds at large banks, as well as enlarged sales staffs and
more intense marketing. M2 growth also was damped somewhat in March

by a temporary pause between waves of settlements of mortgage
refinancing transactions and by the use of seasonal adjustment
factors that were swollen by the lagged effects of year-end monetary
easings in 1990 and 1991.
In April a turnaround of the seasonal distortions and a
strengthening in prepayments of mortgage-backed securities boosted
growth in demand deposits and Ml. At the M2 level, however, this
pickup was mostly offset by weak nonwithheld tax payments, which
depressed the buildup of liquid household balances. In early May, a
reversal of tax effects and likely still stronger prepayment
activity probably contributed to a bounce-back of Ml and M2.
M3 edged higher in April after declining in March. The broad
aggregate was boosted by an increase in large time deposits--the
first monthly growth in more than two years. Institution-only money
funds declined in both March and April. M3 also has jumped in early
May.
Nondeposit sources of funds grew briskly at both domestic and
foreign-related banks in March and April. Large U.S. offices of
foreign banks have continued to increase their reliance on
borrowings from related foreign offices. Thus, despite the weakness
of the broader monetary aggregates, bank credit expanded moderately,
growing at rates of 5-1/4 and 5 percent in March and April
respectively.1 The growth of bank credit has been accounted for
by acquisitions of securities. Total loans slid further in March
before flattening out in April, when consumer loans jumped, partly
as a result of a comparative lack of securitizations, but largely
reflecting increased credit extensions. Real estate loans were
little changed and business loans fell over the two-month period.
The pattern of loan growth among banks (table) shows that most of

Call Report.

the recent weakness in these two components and in total loans was
at large domestic banks and foreign-related institutions. The
continued runoff of business loans at larger banks in part likely
reflects the use of proceeds from bond and stock issuance; at small
banks. business loan growth, while weaker in April, has been
positive for the past few months. The decline in real estate loans
at foreign banks and large domestic banks probably is a continuation
of an ongoing adjustment in the commercial real estate sector.

Banks, having fortified their capital positions by issuing
equity and subordinated debt and by retaining a record amount of
earnings, appear able to increase their loan portfolios. Responses
to the most recent Senior Loan Officer Survey indicate that banks
have begun to ease terms and standards on business loans and that
the demand for bank loans has increased a bit in recent months.
However, the persistence of wide rate spreads on loans suggests that
banks continue to seek greater compensation for risk bearing than in
times past.
Nonfinancial Business Finance
Incoming data since the last FOMC meeting point to no real
pickup in aggregate net business borrowing from the sluggish pace
evident since last year. Underlying external funding needs have
been modest, and net equity issuance has remained strong, damping
the need of many corporations to borrow. The strength in commercial
paper in April was only enough to balance the weakness in business
loans, leaving their sum up only slightly for the month. Gross
public bond offerings by nonfinancial corporations were
exceptionally high again in April, albeit below the torrid pace of
the first quarter.
The private placement market has seen a recent deluge of issues
by below-investment-grade companies, with more than $3-1/2 billion
reported to have been raised since early March. In addition, Time-
Warner and News Corp., two companies with split ratings, sold a
combined $1-1/2 billion. All $5 billion of offerings have come with
registration rights, which obligate the issuers to register the
securities as public issues with the Securities and Exchange
Commission within a few months. Investors view these private issues
as virtually equivalent to publicly issued junk bonds, and junk-bond
mutual funds have been the primary buyers.

Gross public offerings of equity by nonfinancial corporations
fell in April from the rapid first-quarter pace but, at about $3-3/4
billion, were near the heavy issuance rate of the past two years.
Initial public offerings by nonfinancial firms fell sharply to $600
million in April from March's total of $1.8 billion, the first
reading below $1 billion since November.
Although low interest rates and corporate restructuring have
improved business balance sheets in the aggregate, downgrades by
Moody's of nonfinancial corporate bonds exceeded upgrades, 41 to 23,
in the first quarter and were near the fourth-quarter levels of
1992. Downgrades were particularly common among firms tied to the
commercial aviation, aerospace, and computer businesses. Ratings
improved substantially among banks, however, and only four insurance
companies were downgraded last quarter compared with ten in the
previous quarter. Recently published data indicate that, in 1992,
the failure rate of businesses rose slightly in the Pacific Coast
region but were about unchanged in other areas of the country.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that net marketable Treasury borrowing
will total $50 billion in the second quarter of which $26 billion
will be used to finance the second-quarter federal deficit, and the
remainder will boost the end-of-quarter cash balance.2
Nonmarketable borrowing is expected to increase from last quarter's
pace, largely reflecting purchases of SLGs by state and local
governments with proceeds from sales of advance refunding bonds.
As usual, the short end of the maturity spectrum has borne the
brunt in offsetting the effect on the Treasury's cash balance of
April tax inflows. Weekly Treasury bill auctions in April were cut
2. In early April, Congress temporarily increased the debt
ceiling to $4.37 trillion. The debt ceiling is scheduled to revert
to the $4.15 trillion level at the end of September.

from $22.4 billion to $20 billion, but since have been boosted back
to $24 billion, reflecting individual nonwithheld tax payments that
were lower than expected and the Treasury's increased reliance on
short-term borrowing.
The Treasury's intended shift in debt management, announced in
advance of the May midquarter refunding and designed to lower
Treasury borrowing costs, elicited little market reaction. These
shifts, which will be implemented after the May midquarter
refunding, include auctioning thirty-year bonds semiannually in
February and August rather than quarterly (likely resulting in
annual cutbacks of about 40 percent from current levels),
eliminating the quarterly seven-year note auction, and offsetting
these reductions by increasing gross auction sizes of bills and
coupons with maturities of three years or less.
The May midquarter refunding totaled $35 billion: Issuance of
the three-year notes was increased $0.5 billion to $16 billion;
issuance of the ten-year notes was left unchanged at $10.75 billion;
and issuance of the thirty-year bonds was reduced $1 billion to
$8.25 billion. The latter two issues were re-openings from
previously auctioned securities. The Treasury also announced that
it would auction a long-dated $15 billion cash management bill in
mid-May, which will help cushion the effect of the omitted auctions.
The Treasury initiated its Treasury Automated Auction
Processing System (TAAPS) in late April at the fifty-two-week bill
auction. This and subsequent auctions have gone smoothly: The
results generally have been announced earlier than the norm under
the paper-driven system and most of the registered primary dealers
have used TAAPs. The system will allow more reliable enforcement of
Treasury auction rules.

III-12
Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term municipal debt was heavy in April
at $18.7 billion, though down significantly from the $27.5 billion
in March, which was the third highest volume on record. The pace of
new offerings has been brisk thus far in May; the calendar of
prospective offerings, however, has begun to lighten, pointing to
the possibility of some slowing in issuance later in the month.
Refundings continued to dominate offerings, representing more than
70 percent of April's total issuance. Over the past four months,
refundings have been more than two-thirds of all offerings, as
compared with roughly 40 percent in 1992. The large volume of new
offerings has contributed to a small increase in municipal bond
yields relative to Treasury rates since early March. Upward
pressure on tax-exempt yields also came from an appreciable slowing
in inflows to tax-exempt bond funds in March, which in the past two
years were the largest group of buyers of municipal bonds.

Boosted by California's $3.0 billion of revenue anticipation
notes and an $850 million offering by New York, short-term tax-
exempt volume surged in April to $4.5 billion. Proceeds from both
offerings were used primarily to pay off maturing short-term debt.
New York's offering was considerably smaller than those in recent
years, reflecting a program implemented in 1990 to refinance the
deficit with long-term bonds.
The fiscal outlook for state and local governments appears to
be slowly improving. A recent survey of state budget officers
indicates that states generally have adopted conservative budgets
for 1993 and 1994, with spending increases averaging 3 percent each
year. Revenues are expected to grow at a slightly greater pace over
the same period, even though most states are eschewing tax
increases.
Credit-rating changes on long-term municipal bonds showed some
improvement during the first quarter of 1993. At Moody's, the
number of upgrades outpaced the number of downgrades by a margin of
1-1/2 to 1. At Standard and Poor's, downgrades outstripped
upgrades, but the majority of the rating decreases resulted from the
lowering of ratings on two bond insurers; apart from these, the
ratio of upgrades to downgrades was roughly 1.5 compared with 0.28
in 1991 and 0.82 in 1992. Both rating agencies noted strengthening
in the credit quality of revenue bonds, especially those of
utilities.
Mortgage Markets
During the period since the last FOMC meeting, interest rates
on conventional thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages dropped to their
lowest level since August 1972 before edging back up to an average
of 7.42 percent last week--still more than 140 basis points below
their level one year earlier. Mortgage yield spreads widened only

about 6 basis points on balance over the period, and market
volatility has remained elevated (chart). Rates on adjustable-rate
mortgages declined another 19 basis points to 4.63 percent last
week, the lowest level on record.
Against this backdrop, the Mortgage Bankers Association's
indexes of mortgage applications have remained at high levels.
Actual mortgage prepayment rates surged in March, a widely expected
acceleration in light of previous increases in mortgage applications
(chart). Moreover, the index of new applications to finance home
purchases appears to have picked up sharply, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, in recent weeks (chart),
Commensurate with the slowdown in housing activity in the first
quarter and the lagged effects of the decline in mortgage
refinancing applications late last year, gross issuance of agency
pass-through securities declined sharply in February and March from
January's peak. However, issuance of collateralized mortgage
obligations and mortgage strips remained heavy (table). The reduced
supply of mortgage-backed securities and the steady issuance of CMOs
has helped hold spreads below levels seen last year. With the
resurgence of prepayments in March and April, most market analysts
are predicting an imminent rise in issuance of MBSs that likely will
put upward pressure on spreads.
In April, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) voted
to proceed with the enactment of fair-value accounting. The new
rules will become part of GAAP, applying to financial institutions
and nonfinancial institutions with security portfolios. Most
holders of mortgage-backed and other securities likely will
designate them as available for sale, requiring firms directly to
adjust shareholders' equity for unrealized gains and losses.
Investors subject to the new rules are likely to reduce their

holdings of longer maturity instruments because of their greater
price volatility. Indeed, recent surveys indicate that banks
reduced the average maturity of their investment portfolios in 1992,
partly in anticipation of the accounting changes.
Consumer Installment Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit slowed somewhat in March,
in association with the weather-related drop-off in retail sales,
but the increase for the first quarter as a whole was still the
strongest since the fourth quarter of 1989. Installment credit grew
at a 6 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate, compared with a
4-1/2 percent gain in the previous quarter, and a revised 1 percent
increase for all of last year. Auto credit grew at a modest 2-1/2
percent rate in the first quarter after slowing in March, while
revolving credit increased at an 11 percent rate for the quarter.
One factor underlying the recent resurgence in revolving credit
may be the heavy promotion of credit cards with rebates and other
incentives tied to the volume of transactions. General Motors, in
partnership with Household Credit Services, introduced a credit card
last October through which cardholders can build up credits of $500
per year toward the purchase of a GM vehicle, based on rebates of 5
percent on every dollar transacted. The GM program is already
considered a major success, with 4.4 million accounts in force and
outstanding balances having climbed to nearly $3 billion by the end
of April. Ford Motor Company initiated a similar plan in
conjunction with Citicorp in February of this year, and several card
plans are tied to frequent-flier programs of the airlines.
Clearly, these types of programs provide incentives for people
to route as many of their transactions as possible through their
card accounts, even though they may plan to avoid financing costs by
paying off such charges when billed. But such convenience use not

Merchandise Trade
The U.S. merchandise trade deficit was $7.2 billion in February
(seasonally adjusted, Census basis), the same as in January
(revised); there was little change recorded in the levels of either
exports or imports. For exports, increases in agricultural
products, automotive parts, aircraft, and semiconductors (which in
all cases reversed declines recorded in the previous month) were
largely offset by decreases in other categories, especially gold,
other industrial supplies, and machinery. There were similarly
offsetting movements in imports in February -- imported motor
vehicles and semiconductors increased while the value of imported
oil, other industrial supplies, foods, and machinery declined. Data
for March will be released on May 19.

exports was in aircraft, automotive products and gold, categories
that increased sharply (and for largely transitory reasons) in the
fourth quarter. By area, the drop in nonagricultural exports was
concentrated among the developing countries, particularly Taiwan and
China. Exports to both of these countries had jumped noticeably in
the fourth quarter, and appear to have returned to more typical
levels in January-February. Strong shipments to the United Kingdom
were offset by declines in exports to most other industrial
countries.
The 5 percent drop in imports in January-February was spread
over all major trade categories. A noticeable decline was recorded
for imports of consumer goods, which fell for the second consecutive
quarter. Imports of other industrial supplies and aircraft also
dropped sharply. The decline in imports was fairly evenly balanced
between industrial and developing countries. Imports from Germany,
Hong Kong, and Singapore all retreated from relatively high levels
in the fourth quarter. Imports from Canada increased; automotive
imports accounted for 84 percent of the gain.
The value of imported oil declined in February, as a drop in
quantity was only partly offset by a small increase in price. For
January-February combined, the quantity imported averaged 8.4
million barrels per day, about the same as recorded in both the
third and fourth quarters of last year. The price of imported oil

averaged $16.21 per barrel in January-February, a drop of about
$1.75 per barrel from the fourth-quarter average, as mild winter
weather depressed oil prices.
After rising almost continuously during February, spot oil
prices (West Texas Intermediate (WTI)) have fluctuated in a
relatively narrow $1.00 per barrel band around $20.00 per barrel
since March. Second-quarter production cuts agreed to by OPEC
members in their mid-February accord have been realized (especially
for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) and appear to be balancing the seasonal
decline in oil consumption. The June WTI futures contract is now
trading at $20.08 per barrel. The oil market appears quite calm, as
evidenced by the low expected future price volatility derived from
the crude oil options market. Movements in spot and futures prices
suggest further increases in the oil import unit value in March and
April (given shipping and contract lags), with the April import unit
value averaging in the neighborhood of $17.50 per barrel.
Prices of Exports and Non-oil Imports
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), prices of
U.S. non-oil imports increased 0.3 percent in March. Increases were
recorded in all major categories except foods, feeds, and beverages.
Price increases were largest for industrial supplies and materials,
largely the result of continuing increases in the prices of imported
lumber and a sharp increase in the price of imported electricity.
Prices of U.S. exports fell slightly in March; prices of
agricultural exports decreased 0.4 percent, while prices of
nonagricultural exports remained unchanged. The decline in
agricultural prices was primarily attributable to the second
consecutive month of decline in prices of food grains. For
nonagricultural exports, an increase in the prices of industrial

supplies and materials (largely lumber) was offset by declines in
prices for every other major category.
For the first quarter as a whole, the BLS reported that prices
of non-oil imports declined 3.3 percent at an annual rate from the
fourth quarter of 1992. The decrease followed two quarters of price
increases and was spread among all major trade categories. The
decline was associated in part with the appreciation of the dollar
late last year. The drop in the price of imported capital goods was
almost entirely the result of the continued decline in the price of
imported accessories and parts for computers (8.0 percent at an
annual rate). Prices of exports increased slightly in the first
quarter following small declines in the previous two quarters. Most
of the rise was in prices of exported agricultural products (notably
soybeans and vegetables) and consumer goods (apparel, toiletries and
cosmetics).
U.S. International Financial Transactions
In the first quarter, banks in the United States reported a
$6.8 billion outflow. (See line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table.) In part, this outflow reflected
a decline in foreign nonbanks' deposits at banks in the United
States. In April, monthly average data on the net claims of U.S.
banking offices on own foreign offices and IBFs indicate a net
capital inflow (line 1 on the International Banking table on page
IV-8), principally due to an increase in net borrowing by foreign-
chartered banks from their affiliates abroad. Despite the increase
in net Eurodollar borrowing at agencies and branches of foreign
banks, asset positions have remained about flat.
Foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities remained nearly
as strong in the first quarter as the very large net purchases in

the fourth quarter (line 3 of the Summary table). Canada, Japan,
and the United Kingdom were the principal net purchasers, and
substantial net purchases were directed through the Netherlands
Antilles.
After reaching an all-time high in 1992, U.S. net private
purchases of foreign stocks and bonds surged at an even faster pace
in the first quarter of 1993 (line 2c of the Summary Table).
Foreign bonds accounted for 70 percent of the total net purchases in
the first quarter, unlike in 1991 and 1992 when foreign stocks were
more alluring. U.S. net purchases of stocks in Japan, however, of
over $1.7 billion were particularly strong in the first quarter.
Bond purchases in the first quarter were concentrated in Canadian
and U.K. offerings. The large volume of Yankee bonds issued by
entities from these countries contributed to this total. Consistent
with the higher yielding stocks and bonds observed domestically,
Eurodollar holdings of U.S. nonbank residents drifted downward in
the first quarter, and fell further in April (line 3 of the
International Banking table).
Some of the recent surge in recorded U.S. net purchases of
foreign stocks and bonds can be attributed to improvements in the
coverage of U.S. purchases and sales of foreign securities through
foreign financial intermediaries. The new reporters are primarily
pension funds and money managers. Over the last 15 months, the new
reporters have accounted for about 10 percent of net purchases.
Eurobond activity in March was reminiscent of the mid-1980s.
The high value of issues, at $4.5 billion, was last observed in
1987. Moreover, the large number of floating rate notes (seven) was
last observed in 1985. Finally, the value of non-dollar issues
($1.43 billion) was also above the monthly average for recent years.

Foreign official reserve assets held in the United States
increased in the first quarter (line 4 of the Summary table).
principally by "other countries" (line 4a), including Spain,
Argentina, Mexico, Singapore, and Australia. Germany registered a
substantial decrease. Preliminary data from the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York for April indicate substantial increases in
Japanese holdings associated with intervention purchases to support
the dollar.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average foreign exchange value of the dollar in
terms of the other G-10 currencies, shown in the accompanying chart,
has declined just over 2 percent since the last FOMC meeting. The
dollar continued its depreciation versus the Japanese yen, declining
3-1/2 percent on balance, and the dollar also fell just over 1
percent versus the German mark. Initially the dollar declined in
part due to sentiment that the U.S. recovery had slowed, prompted by
a string of worse-than-expected data releases. Late in the period
the dollar rebounded as the outlook for continental Europe. and
Germany in particular, became more pessimistic.
At the end of March and in early April, when the Japanese
fiscal stimulus package was taking firm shape just as President
Clinton's U.S. fiscal stimulus proposal began to falter in Congress,
the U.S. dollar depreciated sharply versus the Japanese yen.
Japanese officials decried the yen's rapid appreciation, and on
April 2 the Bank of Japan initiated intervention purchases of U.S.
dollars to smooth the yen's appreciation. Through most of April,
however, neither U.S. nor other foreign officials offered support.

Bentsen were interpreted to favor appreciation of the yen. Since
the beginning of April the Bank of Japan has purchased a large
quantity of dollars
on April 27 the New York Desk also sold $200 million
worth of Japanese yen. The sale was evenly divided between the
accounts of the Federal Reserve System and the U.S. Treasury. The
yen steadied in the wake of the U.S. intervention, but rose back
slightly before depreciating at the very end of the period.
In Europe, the Bundesbank continued its policy of gradual
interest rate reduction in the face of slowly deteriorating
forecasts for the German economy during the remainder of this year.
At first, declining rates at Bundesbank security repurchases guided
short-term market interest rates lower; later, on April 22, the
Bundesbank cut the Lombard rate 50 basis points to 8-1/2 percent and
the discount rate 25 basis points to 7-1/4 percent. German call
money rates have fallen 80 basis points, and three-month interest
rates have declined 40 basis points. Most other European central
banks followed the Bundesbank's lead and cut their official interest
rates by similar amounts. French interest rates declined more
sharply than other European interest rates. In particular, French
call money rates and three-month interest rates have fallen 280 and
310 basis points respectively since the last FOMC meeting. Despite
the rapid decline in French interest rates and large DM purchases by
the Bank of France, the French franc appreciated 3/4 percent versus
the German mark. The franc now trades 1/2 percent below its parity
with the German mark, and appears to have left devaluation pressures
behind following the second round of the French elections on March 21.
On the other hand, ahead of the Spanish elections on June 6, the
Spanish peseta came under pressure in late April. In response, the

IV-13
Bank of Spain reversed a previous decline in interest rates, and
Spanish three-month interest rates rose 1/2 percent on balance.
On May 13, the Bank of Spain suspended its obligation to
defend the peseta within the ERM and the Spanish government
requested a realignment of the ERM grid. The Portuguese escudo was
suspended shortly after the peseta. Nonetheless, Bank of Spain
officials indicated that there was no intent to float the peseta.
In Italy, the government corruption scandal continued to take its
toll on the lira at the end of March. However, in mid-April a
popular referendum called for electoral reform to end proportional
representation in the Senate, and the lira recovered for a net
appreciation of 6 percent versus the U.S. dollar, while an interim
government under former Bank of Italy Governor Ciampi settled into
office. In the United Kingdom, there are signs that the economy is
moving out of its recession, and the British pound has appreciated
3-1/2 percent versus the U.S. dollar on the heels of a string of
better-than-expected economic statistics. However, the net
appreciation of the pound was reduced by a decline late in the
period following a crushing defeat of the Conservatives in local
elections.
The Canadian dollar depreciated 2 percent versus the U.S.
dollar among renewed concerns about the Canadian federal and
provincial debts, as well as the larger-than-expected federal
deficit in this year's Canadian budget, which was presented at the
end of April.
In international equity markets, the London and Frankfurt
indices posted small declines. However, in Tokyo, the Nikkei index
rose 11 percent during the period, which coincided with the

IV-14
beginning of a new Japanese fiscal year, and may have been aided by
the Japanese fiscal stimulus package.
After an extended period of stability, prices of precious
metals moved up sharply during the period. The dollar price of gold
rose almost 11 percent, while the silver price increased just over
23 percent. Part of the price increase is due to the dollar's
decline, but several market participants also cited expectations for
increased Asian demand as a reason for the gold price rise.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent economic indicators point to continued weak economic
activity on average in the major foreign industrial economies. It
appears that activity in western Germany in the first quarter
weakened further after negative fourth-quarter growth. First-
quarter growth also appears to have been weak or even negative in
Japan, France, and Italy, but there are indications that these
countries may be nearing recession troughs. Recovery in the United
Kingdom appears to be firming, and activity in Canada continued to
move ahead at a modest pace.
Weak economic activity has kept inflation subdued in most
countries, although in some countries special factors have caused
measured rates of inflation to rise. Recent VAT increases in
western Germany have raised the 12-month rate of CPI inflation, but
other western German price measures have been stable or have fallen.
Although sterling depreciation and stronger demand in the United
Kingdom appear to be adding to upward pressure on consumer prices,
inflation has stayed low. Consumer price inflation remains moderate
in Italy, but producer and wholesale price inflation have picked up
due to lira depreciation.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, recent indicators have
been mixed and, on balance, show activity continuing at a weak pace

but with some positive signs. In March, industrial production
(s.a.) increased 0.5 percent, although it still was more than 2
percent below its year-earlier level. New machinery orders (s.a.)
increased for the fourth consecutive month in February with a 3.7
percent rise, and new passenger car registrations (s.a.) increased
5 percent in March, their third consecutive monthly rise. Housing
starts (s.a.) also rose 3.8 percent in March and were up 9.2 percent
on a 12-month basis. Inventory adjustment appears to be continuing
with the inventory/shipments ratio (s.a.) falling 1.5 percent in
February; the inventories index in March was more than 3-1/4 percent
below its year-earlier level.
Balanced against these developments, retail sales dropped 7.5
percent in March, and the EPA's measure of consumer confidence
slipped in the first quarter to its lowest level in more than 10
years. Labor-market indicators remain soft. The unemployment rate
(s.a.) was unchanged at 2.3 percent in March, but the job offers to
applicants ratio (s.a.), a more sensitive indicator of labor market
conditions, decreased 3.3 percent to a level 40 percent below its
previous peak two years earlier. Another indicator of recent labor
market weakness has been a fall in overtime hours, which recorded a
12-month decline of 20 percent in February.

Inflationary pressures have remained subdued, in part because
of the recent strength of the yen. Consumer prices in the Tokyo
area (n.s.a.) were up 0.6 percent in April, and their 12-month
increase was only 0.9 percent. Some of the recent weakness in the
12-month measure of consumer prices reflects a drop in perishable
food prices. Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) declined 0.5 percent in
March and showed a 12-month decrease of 2.3 percent. The latest
12-month increase in wages was 2.7 percent in February.
Japan's trade surplus (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter was $120
billion; the first-quarter current account surplus was $145 billion.
On April 13, the government announced a new fiscal stimulus
package totaling 13.2 trillion (2-3/4 percent of GDP). As was the
case with the package announced last August, the new measures
concentrate on increased public works spending and expanded credit
programs. There were also modest tax incentives for housing and
small business investment. The package is expected to be approved
by late June, and should provide an extra boost to GDP of roughly
1-1/2 percent spread over several quarters this year and in 1994.
Major economic indicators in western Germany point to a
continued decline in real GDP in the first quarter. After falling
more than 4 percent (s.a.) in the fourth quarter, industrial
production dropped 3.4 percent in the first quarter, while total

orders fell an additional 0.2 percent (s.a.). Provisional data
indicate that real retail sales rose 0.9 percent in March from their
year-ago level; however, real retail sales in the first quarter were
down 6 percent from a year ago. In April, the unemployment rate
(s.a.) rose to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent in March.
Consumer prices in western Germany increased 4.3 percent in
April on a year/year basis, a further increase from the 1992 average
of 4 percent. The April figure reflects in part the effect of a
value-added tax increase at the beginning of January. Other
measures of inflation have shown less upward movement. Wholesale
prices (n.s.a.) dropped 1.6 percent during the year ending in March,
and producer prices were up 0.3 percent over the same period. March
import prices (n.s.a.) were 2.7 percent below their level one year
ago.
The pan-German current account deficit (s.a.) exceeded $25
billion in 1992, about $6 billion larger than the 1991 deficit. In
January, the current account deficit (n.s.a.) totalled $3.1 billion.
Through March, pan-German M3 increased 3.2 percent (s.a.a.r.)
relative to the fourth quarter of 1992, below the Bundesbank's 1993
target range of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. The Bundesbank's assertion
that M3 growth remains strong likely is based on M3 growth on a
year/year basis, which was 8.3 percent over the 12 months ending in
March.
Recently, employers in the chemicals, metals, and engineering
industries in eastern Germany suspended contracts negotiated last
year that called for increases in nominal wages of about 25 percent
on April 1 and equalization of wages with those in western Germany
by 1994. Settlement was reached in the chemicals industry when
employers agreed to increase wages by 9 percent this year. However,

IV-21
on May 3, eastern German IG Metall workers staged a strike that has
spread to more than 70 steel and engineering companies.
The "solidarity pact" recently reached between the federal and
Laender (or state) governments largely determines transfer payments
from western to eastern Laender. The agreement takes effect in
1995, and reinstates the 7-1/2 percent surcharge on income. Under
this program, the budget deficit of the territorial authorities (a
broad budget concept) is expected to narrow from almost 5 percent of
GDP in 1993 to under 4 percent in 1995. The Federal budget for
1993, approved last fall, has been revised to account for the
expected decline in tax revenues from the weakening German economy.
Finance Minister Waigel recently announced that the 1993 Federal
deficit is projected to reach DM 65 to 70 billion (2.4 percent of
GDP), up from the 1992 deficit of DM 38.6 billion (1.4 percent of
GDP).
In France, monthly indicators suggest that first-quarter GDP
was weak and may have declined again. After falling slightly in
January, industrial production rose 2.5 percent (s.a.) in February
due largely to the 8.1 percent rise in energy production caused by
unusually cold weather. The increase in manufacturing output was
only 0.5 percent. The Bank of France's business survey indicates
that industrial production probably was flat in March. Other
monthly indicators were largely negative. Unemployment rose in
March to 10.7 percent (s.a.) from 10.6 percent in February. In the
first quarter, consumption of manufactured products fell 2.9 percent
(s.a.) below its fourth-quarter level, indicating that total
consumption, which was strong in the fourth quarter, has weakened
significantly.
The consumer price index increased 2.2 percent in March from
its year-earlier level, up only slightly from the 2.0 percent

IV-22
increase registered in December (which was a 36-year low).
Provisional data indicate that the consumer price index rose
2.2 percent in April from its year-earlier level.
The new French government of Edouard Balladur has proposed
fiscal measures to encourage employment. Specifically, it plans to
reduce payroll taxes to encourage employment and to provide support
to the construction sector. Partly as a result, the new government
projects that the central government budget deficit will increase to
4-3/4 percent of GDP from 3.2 percent of GDP in 1992. Moreover, the
government projects that the deficit in the social security budget
will more than double, resulting in a general government budget
deficit of close to 6 percent of GDP. To return the social security
budget to balance the government intends to raise the CSG, a tax on
all income used to finance social security, raise some excise taxes,
and scale back pension benefits. The new government's medium-term
objective is to reduce the central budget deficit to 2.5 percent of
GDP by 1997.
The new government has proposed legislation granting
independence to the Bank of France. The formal objective of an
independent Bank of France will be to guarantee stability of the
currency. However, the French government will retain the right to
choose the exchange rate regime and when to realign the parity. The
Bank of France is to have responsibility for controlling interest
rates and monetary aggregates and for setting reserve requirements.
The Bank of France also will maintain its role in bank supervision.
The economy in the United Kingdom continues to exhibit signs of
recovery. According to provisional estimates, real GDP grew 1.1
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter of 1993 after rising 0.7
percent in the final quarter of 1992. However, excluding oil and
gas production, real GDP rose 2.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) after having

IV-23
stagnated in the previous three quarters. In April, a Confederation
of British Industry (CBI) survey indicated that export orders are
lifting firms out of recession and that in coming months total
orders and output are expected to record the strongest growth in
four years. Housing starts (s.a.) rose 22 percent in the first
quarter from the previous quarter. Unemployment (s.a.) fell
unexpectedly for two consecutive months to stand at a rate of
10.5 percent in March.
Inflation has picked up a bit recently; consumer prices
(n.s.a.) rose 0.7 percent in February and 0.4 percent in March,
reversing a 0.9 percent drop in January. In March, the 12-month
inflation rate edged up to 1.9 percent from 1.8 percent in February.
Underlying inflation has risen as well; excluding mortgage interest
rates, consumer prices were up 0.7 percent in March to stand 3.5
percent above their level of March 1992. In April, producer prices
(n.s.a.) rose 0.4 percent and were up 3.8 percent from April 1992
while the cost of materials and fuel (n.s.a.) stood 7.2 percent
above the level of a year ago. Cost increases associated with the
depreciation of sterling since last September have been offset by
continued moderation in labor costs.
In Italy, economic growth remained negative in the fourth
quarter. Real GDP (s.a.a.r.) fell 2.4 percent following a decline
of 2.0 percent in the third quarter. However, other more recent
indicators suggest that Italy may be nearing the trough of its
current recession. Provisional data indicate that industrial
production (s.a.a.r.) rose 4.8 percent in January and February, and
survey data suggest that it rose about 6 percent in March. An
economic survey of businessmen, conducted in early March, indicates
that production in the investment goods sector might reverse its
downward trend in late spring.

IV-24
Weakness in economic activity has restrained inflation which,
through April, averaged 4.3 percent (12-month basis), down from the
average rate of 5.3 percent recorded in 1992. However, consumer
price inflation may rise soon as the effect of lira depreciation,
which already has caused larger increases in producer and wholesale
prices, feeds through to consumer prices.
Provisional data indicate that the trade deficit in 1992
narrowed to $10.3 billion from $13.0 billion in 1991 while the
current account deficit widened to $23.9 billion in 1992 from $21.4
billion in 1991. The deterioration of the current account reflects.
an increased deficit on invisibles and investment income.
On April 22, Prime Minister Giuliano Amato resigned and was
replaced by former Bank of Italy Governor Carlo Ciampi. On May 4,
Antonio Fazio was named the new Governor of the Bank of Italy.
In Canada, real GDP grew 3.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth
quarter. More recent data point to continued growth. In January
and February, taken together, industrial production (s.a.) rose 1.0
percent from its fourth-quarter average, GDP at factor cost (s.a.)
expanded 0.6 percent, factory shipments (s.a.) increased 1.5
percent, new orders (s.a.) surged 3.6 percent, and retail sales
(s.a.) were up 1.8 percent. Total employment (s.a.) grew 0.6
percent in the first quarter, but it slipped 0.1 percent from that
level in April, as the unemployment rate (s.a.) rose to 11.4
percent. Housing starts (s.a.) plunged 14 percent in the first
quarter, but rebounded in April to a level near their fourth-quarter
average.
Recent price data show that inflation has remained moderate.
The targeted 12-month change in the CPI excluding food and energy
(n.s.a.) decreased from 2.1 percent in February to 1.9 percent in
March. The all-items CPI was also up 1.9 percent over this period.

IV-25
and wholesale prices rose 3.6 percent. Wage settlements increased
about 1-1/2 percent in January-February.
Largely because of strong export growth, the current account
deficit (s.a.a.r.) narrowed in the fourth quarter to $20.7 billion.
Exports continued to surge in January and February, and the
merchandise trade surplus (s.a.a.r.) for the two months combined
widened to $14.6 billion from a fourth-quarter level of $10.8
billion.
In Russia, provisional data show that gross industrial
production in the first quarter of 1993 was 19 percent below its
level in the same period last year, up slightly from a year/year
decline of 23 percent in the fourth quarter. Available monthly data
imply an upward trend over the first quarter.
Inflation has moderated somewhat since the beginning of the
year. Monthly increases in consumer prices (n.s.a.) fell from 26
percent in January to 16 percent in April. During the four-week
period ending April 20, food prices increased at a monthly rate of
17 percent.
On April 15, G-7 Foreign and Finance Ministers announced a new
$43 billion aid package for Russia. The package includes new
lending from the IMF, World Bank, EBRD, and G-7 export credit
agencies as well as the refinancing of $15 in debt-service
obligations under the recent Paris Club rescheduling. The package
contains $3 billion in loans, with only marginal policy condition-
ality, from the IMF's new Systemic Transformation Facility.
In an important referendum on April 25th, 58 percent of those
voting expressed confidence in President Yeltsin, while 53 percent
endorsed the Russian government's economic policies. Support for
new legislative elections was less than a majority of all registered

IV-26
voters, the legal requirement, although 67 percent of votes cast
favored such elections.
In Eastern Europe, recovery appears to have stalled in the
first quarter in several key countries. In Poland, weaker exports
related in part to decelerating demand in Western Europe, has been a
factor in the sluggish pace of activity. Industrial production fell
in 1993-Q1 for the first time since 1990, and the unemployment rate
was above 14 percent in April. Twelve-month inflation remained just
below 40 percent in March. On April 30, the government won
parliamentary passage of its mass privatization bill, a key element
in a package of legislation that will implement its program for
restructuring the enterprise and financial sectors. In early May,
Poland and a committee of bank creditors agreed to general
principles governing negotiations on restructuring $12 billion of
the country's debt to commercial banks, including short-term
revolving credits, medium-term debt, and interest arrears. Polish
authorities have announced that the country will begin monthly
payments (of about $5 million) on its $8.5 billion medium-term debt.
In the Czech Republic, recovery appears to have been slowed by
a sharp drop in trade with the Slovak Republic following the break-
up of the Czech-Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR) in January. Full
privatization of Czech state industry -- specifically final delivery
of ownership shares in Czech firms to the general public holding
vouchers -- has been delayed by a dispute between Czech and Slovak
authorities over division of assets of the former CSFR. Passage of
a new bankruptcy law may force many firms and banks to adopt
stricter financial discipline, increase layoffs, and accelerate some
enterprise failures. In mid-March, the IMF approved a new one-year
SDR 177 million ($250 million equivalent) IMF stand-by credit for
the Czech Republic.

IV-27
Economic Situation in Other Countries
Real GDP in Mexico grew 2.6 percent in 1992, with growth
declining in the latter part of the year. Interest rates have
fallen since early March, reflecting lower expected inflation and
continued slow economic growth. The peso has weakened somewhat
since late April. In Brazil, economic activity and inflation have
picked up in recent months. A new economic plan, announced
April 24, appears to be insufficient to secure a new IMF stand-by
arrangement. Argentina's industrial production growth has fallen
sharply from its year-ago rate. On April 7, the Argentine
government closed a Brady Plan debt restructuring arrangement with
commercial bank creditors. In Venezuela, the possibility that
President Perez may have to leave office because of alleged
misappropriation of funds has roiled financial markets. Rapid
expansion of imports in Taiwan, associated with continued high rates
of GDP growth, contributed to a reduction in the trade surplus in
the first four months of 1993. China's real GDP grew 14.1 percent
in the first three months of 1993 (Q1/Q1). Weak economic activity
in Korea spurred the Bank of Korea to cut interest rates further on
March 25.
Individual country notes. Mexico's real GDP grew 2.6 percent
in 1992. Growth slowed during the year, and output in the fourth
quarter was only 1.9 percent greater than a year earlier.
Economic growth appears to have remained sluggish in the early
months of 1993, judging from anecdotal evidence and from the
disappointing first-quarter earnings reports issued by leading
companies. Reflecting this situation, the Mexico City stock market
index fell sharply in late April and early May.
Interest rates have continued a decline that began in early
March, reflecting decreases in expected inflation and in economic

IV-28
growth. At the auction of May 12, the twenty-eight-day Treasury-
bill rate was 15.1 percent, down 232 basis points from the March
high. The monthly CPI increases have been progressively lower since
a 1.3 percent rise in January, having fallen to 0.6 percent in both
March and April. In April, the CPI was 10.1 percent above a year
earlier.
After a six-month period in which the Mexican peso appreciated
slightly in nominal terms against the dollar, the peso depreciated
by 1.3 percent from April 23 to May 12. On May 12, the exchange
rate was 3.131 pesos per dollar, 3.4 percent above the lower limit
of the band within which it floats.
At the end of 1992, reserves including gold were $18.5 billion,
up about $1 billion from the end of 1991. The reported reserve gain
last year is smaller than would have been expected with a capital
account surplus of $26 billion and a current account deficit of
$22.8 billion. Large negative errors and omissions, which fill the
gap, include a combination of net unrecorded imports of goods and
services and net unrecorded capital outflows. Indications are that
strong capital inflows continued in the early months of 1993,
helping international reserves to rise further. However, data on
the level of reserves during 1993 are not yet available.
In January-February 1993, manufactured exports were only about
4 percent higher than a year earlier. Merchandise imports were
9 percent higher for these two months, after a 26 percent increase
in 1992 as a whole.
Economic activity in Brazil appears to have picked up in recent
months, especially in consumer durables, after a revised 1.1 percent
decline for 1992 as a whole. Inflation has increased since Itamar
Franco became president in early December 1992. Monthly inflation
rose from a range of 20 to 25 percent in the last quarter of 1992 to

IV-29
about 28 percent in March and April. The trade surplus declined
from $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 1992 to $2.5 billion for
the same period this year; exports rose only 4 percent, while
imports climbed 16 percent.
The Brazilian government unveiled a new economic plan on
April 24. The macroeconomic stabilization measures in the plan
appear to be insufficient to secure a new IMF stand-by arrangement.
A new IMF program would facilitate the conclusion of Brazil's
negotiations with commercial bank creditors on a Brady-style
restructuring of $44 billion in external debt. Brazil would like
participating banks to limit the share of debt tendered for par and
discount bonds, the most expensive options to collateralize, to no
more than 40 percent each.
In Argentina, growth in industrial production has slowed to
1.9 percent (Q1/Q1), in contrast to last year's growth (Q1/Q1) of
more than 25 percent. The CPI rose 0.8 percent in March and 1
percent in April. The CPI has risen 11.7 percent over the past
twelve months, compared with a 30.2 percent increase over the same
period a year earlier.
On April 7, Argentina closed a Brady Plan debt restructuring
arrangement with its commercial bank creditors. A total of
$19.8 billion in bank debt was exchanged for 30-year par and
discount bonds with fully collateralized principal and a rolling
one-year interest guarantee. Interest arrears of $8.3 billion will
be converted to 12-year uncollateralized bonds by September 1993.
The debt restructuring arrangement was supported by $2.7 billion in
loans from the IMF, World Bank, IDB, and the Japan Export-Import
Bank.
In late March, Argentina passed a quarterly review under its
IMF Extended Fund Facility. All quantitative performance criteria

IV-30
were met, but a deadline for social security reforms was postponed
due to legislative delays; the lower house of the Argentine congress
approved a reform package in late April, and final approval is
expected to occur in June.
In Venezuela, the Supreme Court is expected to rule on May 20
as to whether President Perez should be tried for alleged
misappropriation of funds. If a trial is conducted and Perez
resigns, Congress would select an interim President within 30 days,
and that person would serve until elections in December. In
response to these events, the Caracas stock index declined a total
of 10 percent on May 5 and 6 and the Venezuelan bolivar came under
heavy pressure. The central bank has limited the depreciation of
the currency to less than one percent by buying bolivars and by
boosting the annual yield on three-month bills from 45.3 percent on
May 5 to 61.1 percent on May 12. With expected inflation now about
38 percent, domestic real interest rates stand at very high levels.
Taiwan's real GDP grew 6.6 percent in 1992, compared with
7.2 percent growth in 1991. Net exports declined 38.4 percent due
to weak external demand and rapid import growth. Fixed investment
grew 12.3 percent in 1992, up from 8.2 percent in 1991. Private
fixed investment rose by 14.1 percent, but public fixed investment
continued to fall behind targets. Large parts of Taiwan's ambitious
$303 billion infrastructural program face cancellation once a
current government review is complete. Consumer price inflation
remained stable in March at a year-over-year rate of 3.2 percent.
Taiwan's merchandise trade surplus continued to narrow in the
first four months of 1993, falling to $1.8 billion from $3.8 billion
in the same period for 1992. In the first four months, exports grew
3.4 percent, while imports increased 13.2 percent.

Real GDP in China was 14.1 percent higher in the first quarter
of 1993 than a year earlier. Price pressures are on the rise, with
urban prices up 15.7 percent in the year ending in March 1993, after
a 6.4 percent increase for all 1992. Chinese authorities have been
sanguine in public about recent signs of overheating, but indicate
they may attempt to cool the economy by raising interest rates.
Continued inability of the central authorities to curb rapid lending
growth at local levels, along with the continuing problem of
financing state enterprise losses, suggest that reining in the
economy will be difficult.
Output growth has remained weak in Korea. Industrial
production was only slightly higher in the first quarter of 1993
than in the same period last year. In the twelve months through
April, consumer price inflation was 4.8 percent, compared with 7.1
percent in the year ending April 1992. The current account deficit
narrowed to about $900 million in the first quarter of 1993 from
$3.2 billion in the first quarter of 1992. Exports rose 10 percent,
and imports declined about 3 percent.
In response to the slow pace of economic activity, the Bank of
Korea cut rediscount rates by 1/2 to 1 percentage point on March 25,
and other regulated interest rates were also reduced. These moves
followed rediscount rate reductions of 1 to 2 percentage points in
January 1993. The rediscount rate on commercial and trade bills is
now 5 percent.
