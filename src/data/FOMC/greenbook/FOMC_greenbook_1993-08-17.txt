The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Surveys suggest a continued erosion of consumer and business
optimism about the prospects for economic growth, but this has not
been mirrored in the most recent indicators of employment and
production. July figures point to a rise in hours worked and
industrial output, and, with an increase in motor vehicle assemblies
slated for this month, a decent gain in goods production appears in
train for the current quarter. Key price measures for July will be
published in the next few days; at this time, we see no evidence of
a change in the trend of inflation.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor demand continues to expand at a moderate rate. Nonfarm
payroll employment rose 162,000 in July, after only a small gain in
June, and the civilian unemployment rate declined from 7.0 percent
to 6.8 percent. Hours of production or nonsupervisory workers rose
0.3 percent last month to a level 0.2 percent above the second
quarter average. The BLS reported that these labor market data
revealed little disruption, as of mid-July, from the flooding in the
Mississippi basin.
The effects of the flooding may have shown through, however, in
higher levels of unemployment insurance claims later in the month.
In addition, the two-week layoff of about 250,000 workers at General
Motors contributed to a spike in claims for the week ended July 24.
The data in hand--which are based in part on rough estimates from
Michigan and may be revised substantially--indicate that about
100,000 GM workers filed claims under either regular or emergency
programs. By the end of July, claims had returned to the weekly
level that had prevailed last spring.
In private industry, employment rose 158,000 in July, about
equal to the average monthly gain in the first six months of the

year. The services industry provided half the July job increase,
led, again, by business services. In turn, most of the hiring by
business services occurred at personnel supply firms (which include
temporary help agencies). Continued hiring was also evident in
wholesale and retail trade and in finance, insurance, and real
estate. Construction employment moved up in July, after a small
decline in the preceding month. Manufacturers shed another 13,000
jobs in July, a smaller decline than in recent months. Total
factory job losses have cumulated to more than 150,000 so far this
year. In the government sector, local government payrolls declined
16,000 despite the temporary addition of an estimated 15,000
federally funded summer jobs.
Employment as measured by the household survey moved up 82,000
in July after edging down in June. Regarding the overall
unemployment rate, the BLS emphasized that the July decline was
statistically insignificant: On an unrounded basis, the rate
declined only one-tenth of a percentage point; and with concurrent
seasonal adjustment, the rate has been flat at 6.9 percent for the
past three months. Other indicators from the household survey, such
as involuntary part-time employment and the number of permanent job
losers, also have changed little over the past few months. With a
labor market that jobseekers still perceive is offering only limited
opportunities, the labor force participation rate has continued to
hover only a little above its cyclical low in 1991; rates for both
adult men and adult women are below the levels of last summer.
The relatively strong increases in employment and hours in the
second quarter were not reflected in production. According to
initial estimates, productivity in the nonfarm business sector fell
at a 2-1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, after a
1-1/2 percent decline in the first quarter. In the latter part of

1992, hiring had lagged behind the rapid increases in output, and as
a result some retrenchment in productivity early this year seemed
reasonable, especially in light of the sluggish growth of output.
But the apparent sharpness of the drop in productivity now estimated
for the second quarter of 1993, which brought the level of
productivity below the staff's estimate of its recent trend level,
was surprising, given the reported focus of businesses on improving
efficiency. One possible explanation is that recent output levels
are currently underestimated--an issue that could be resolved, at
least in part, by the upcoming revisions to the NIPAs. But the
recent drop in productivity could also suggest that employers will
turn more cautious about hiring in coming months as they attempt to
restore labor efficiency gains.
Industrial Production
Industrial production slackened in the spring. The slowdown
was widespread but also reflected the coal strike and a cutback in
output of motor vehicles and parts. With factory production
lackluster, capacity utilization in manufacturing fell back
0.5 percentage point between April and June (top panel of chart).
The available indicators for July suggest that industrial
production firmed somewhat last month. Although coal output
declined further and motor vehicle assemblies dropped again (see
below), other weekly physical product indicators show a gain, on
balance. Electricity generation jumped, after a large rise in June;
paper and paperboard, basic steel and steel products, and lumber
posted smaller increases. Elsewhere, among most upstream producers
of durable goods, the factory workweek returned to the high rates
posted in April. On balance, excluding motor vehicles,
manufacturing production worker hours increased 0.2 percent last
month (middle panel of chart).

Production of motor vehicles slipped to a 9.7 million unit
annual rate in July (lower right panel of chart) as carmakers closed
out the 1993 model year with somewhat lower production than they
scheduled a month ago. Dealers' inventories of new domestic autos,
which had shrunk to an estimated 67 days' supply in June, remained
comfortable in July, as sales moved back to about the same pace as
production last month. Stocks of light trucks were toward the low
end of the historical range. Assemblies of both autos and trucks
are scheduled to be much higher in August and September than in
July.

Personal Income and Consumption
Real personal consumption expenditures picked up in the second
quarter, increasing 3.8 percent at an annual rate. This increase
followed almost no growth in the first quarter, when winter storms
disrupted sales of motor vehicles and spending on consumer goods
generally ebbed after the fourth-quarter surge. Cutting through
these gyrations, real consumer spending grew moderately over the
first half of the year, about in line with growth in real income.
Real expenditures on motor vehicles and parts posted a sizable
gain in the first six months of the year, rising more than 9 percent
at an annual rate. Although sales of new cars and light trucks

II-10
declined about 3 percent in July, to 13.9 million units (annual
rate), part of this weakness reportedly reflected a shortage of some
popular models as well as some small disruptions of sales in the
Mississippi basin region.

Note: Data on sales of trucks and imported autos for the current month
are preliminary and subject to revision.
1. Components may not add to totals because of rounding.
2. Excludes some vehicles produced in Canada and Mexico that are
classified as imports by the industry.
The higher level of motor vehicle demand this year follows two
years in which total sales fell roughly 2-1/2 million units per year
short of the average pace of sales during the late 1980s. In
addition to replacement demand, sales have been supported by the
continuation of low finance rates and by the modest size of price
increases, on average, despite noticeable price hikes for Japanese
imports. In June, the CPI for new cars rose 0.2 percent, and was
only 2-1/4 percent higher than a year earlier. Prices of new trucks
increased 0.4 percent in June and have risen 3-1/4 percent over the
past year.

II-11
However, looming on the horizon are potentially sizable
price increases for the 1994 models of foreign makes, particularly
Japanese, as a result of recent movements in exchange rates. In
addition, GM's recently announced price increases for its new
models, which will average about 2 percent when the cost of enhanced
safety and convenience equipment is excluded, are likely to boost
average sticker prices about 7 percent. With regard to incentives,
price breaks have been expanded further and are available on a wide
range of makes and models--but discounts are not generally as deep
as seen at the ends of some recent model years.
Real spending on durable goods other than motor vehicles
advanced at a relatively brisk pace in the second quarter, rising
5-1/2 percent at an annual rate after growing at a 3-1/2 percent
rate in the first quarter. Growth in this component of spending
mainly reflects rising purchases of furniture and household
equipment. Much of this spending is probably the result of the
rising trend of home sales, but with household balance sheets in
better shape, consumers may also be more willing to buy big-ticket
items even if they must borrow to do so. From a longer perspective,
spending on durables other than motor vehicles (as well as total
durables) during the current expansion has risen as a share of total
personal consumption expenditures but by substantially less than in
earlier expansion periods.
Real outlays for nondurable goods grew at a 2-1/2 percent
annual rate in the second quarter after a first-quarter decline.
Although spending on nondurable goods has bounced around a lot--even
on a quarterly average basis--the level of outlays in the second
quarter appeared to be back on the 2 percent (annual rate) trend
that has prevailed since the latter part of 1991 (chart).

Real expenditures on services grew at a 2-1/4 percent annual
rate in the second quarter, held down by unusually low utilities
bills; excluding energy, services spending grew at about a
2-3/4 percent annual pace, led by a surge in air travel. On
balance, real consumption of services has been on a gradual
2-1/4 percent (annual rate) uptrend since early 1991.
Underpinning these spending developments has been moderate
trend growth in real disposable personal income. Real DPI rose
around 2-1/2 percent in 1992, and at about a 2 percent annual rate
in the first half of 1993. Fluctuations in subsidy payments to
farmers, and the timing of year-end bonus payments, have caused some
volatility in the growth of real DPI in the last several quarters.
Looking over a longer period, real labor income has grown at about a
2-1/4 percent annual rate since the fourth quarter of 1991.
Further, the July employment report is consistent with continued
growth in real labor income.
The recent increases in consumer spending have come about
despite an ongoing erosion of consumer confidence. Both the
Michigan and the Conference Board indexes of consumer sentiment
continued to fall through July and are now back near the levels that
prevailed before the onset of the post-election euphoria (chart).
The deterioration of attitudes largely reflects increased pessimism
about the prospects for the economy; assessments of current
conditions have not shown much change since January. Likewise,
responses regarding households' expectations for job market
conditions, which are correlated with spending, have turned
decidedly more pessimistic this year.
Housing Markets
Most housing sector indicators were up substantially in the
second quarter compared with a year earlier, although they generally

II-15
remained slightly below the highs reached in the fourth quarter of
1992. Protracted heavy rainfall in parts of the Midwest hampered
construction in the second quarter, and the flooding that
subsequently occurred likely will have a small effect on residential
construction expenditures in July and in the third quarter.
Total housing starts were unchanged in June, following an
upward revision to a relatively robust May reading, and were well
above the level in the first quarter and a year earlier. Starts in
the dominant single-family sector decreased in June to an annual
rate of 1.08 million units, after a strong increase in May; the June
level is better aligned with the recent pace of construction permits
and new home sales, relative to historical norms.
Sales of single-family homes also increased, on average, during
the second quarter. Sales of new homes rose 11 percent in June to
one of the highest levels in the past three-and-one-half years, and
sales of existing homes increased slightly, both in June and for the
second quarter as a whole. According to anecdotal reports from
parts of the South and the Midwest, rising new home sales have
outstripped the pace of new construction, shrinking the inventory of
homes for sale and placing upward pressure on home prices.
Nationally, price increases for new and existing homes picked
up during the second quarter, with special factors probably
explaining some of the increases. Average selling prices of both
new and existing homes rose about 2 percent from a year earlier;
median prices increased somewhat more rapidly, at rates akin to
those observed in the fourth quarter of 1992, when construction and
sales activity were relatively strong. The constant-quality price
index for new homes, which adjusts for compositional changes in
house quality and the regional mix of sales, rose 5.8 percent from a
1. In the upper Mississippi valley, April-June 1993 was the
wettest period since recordkeeping began ninety-nine years ago.

year earlier, the largest increase in this series since late 1987;
however, this rise may be exaggerated somewhat by an
unrepresentative set of regional weights in the index.2 Also,
rising new home prices in some areas may reflect the cost of lumber
acquired when mill prices temporarily rose sharply earlier this year
owing to a perceived shortage. In addition, a shortage of
developed lots in some localities may be contributing to firming
prices.
Several indicators suggest that the market for single-family
homes continued to strengthen in July (chart). Responding
particularly to continued declines in mortgage rates, consumer
attitudes toward homebuying rose to one of the most positive levels
on record. Also, an index of applications filed at mortgage bankers
for loans to purchase a new or existing home remained high
throughout July, and builders' ratings of new home sales improved
substantially.
Despite the June pickup in the pace of multifamily housing
starts to 175,000 units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, these
starts remain only slightly above their record low. Any lasting
improvement in multifamily construction continues to be impeded by a
persistent oversupply of rental apartments and the resulting
restraint on rents.
2. In 1993:Q2, the median new home transaction price for the
Northeast rose 13.3 percent from the first-quarter level, compared
with 0.7 percent for the unweighted median price for the nation.
The constant-quality measure uses 1987 weights; thus, price changes
in the Northeast are weighted more heavily than would be warranted
by the current proportion of national new home sales in that region,
owing to a sharp decline in sales there in recent years.
3. The mill price of lumber doubled during the winter, reaching
a peak of nearly $475 per thousand board feet in the second half of
March. Prices then plunged during the second quarter, to a low of
$218 per thousand board feet in early July. More recently, prices
have turned up, with the reading for the week ended August 6 at $280
per thousand board feet.

Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment advanced 13 percent at an annual
rate in the second quarter, a pace roughly similar to that of the
first quarter. Investment in nonresidential structures posted
its largest advance in three years. On the equipment side, the
nominal value of shipments of nondefense capital goods was flat in
the second quarter, but rapid price declines for office and
computing equipment boosted real spending; in addition, purchases of
motor vehicles were strong. From the limited information available
on the third quarter, the growth of equipment spending appears to be
subsiding a bit.
Sales of heavy trucks in the second quarter were 12 percent
above their first-quarter level. When these sales fell sharply
between 1988 and 1991, the average age of trucks in use rose
noticeably. The resulting increase in replacement demand, as well
as ongoing technological improvements, likely have provided a
sizable impetus to sales this year; indeed, both major heavy truck
manufacturers, Navistar and Freightliner, are operating at or near
capacity. Business purchases of automobiles and light trucks were
also very high in the second quarter.
Business spending on office and computing equipment advanced at
more than a 15 percent annual rate in the second quarter, after
having increased at an annual rate of close to 100 percent in the
first quarter. Although nominal orders and shipments of computers
flattened in the second quarter, rapid price declines nonetheless
led to a healthy increase in real expenditures. In the third
quarter, however, the downtrend in computer prices may be
sidetracked by repercussions of a fire that recently destroyed the

slight downward revision to second-quarter business fixed
investment.

Sumitomo chemical plant in Japan. That plant produced 40 percent to
60 percent of the world's supply of Bakelite epoxy resin, a crucial
ingredient in many semiconductors. Spot markets responded rapidly
to the bad news in mid-July: Prices for computer memory chips
(DRAMS) have doubled since the fire. The major computer
manufacturers reportedly have large inventories of the affected
components, but a scramble is nonetheless under way to find
substitutes and alternative suppliers. Sumitomo has indicated that
it has two months' supply of the resin and currently is talking with
unnamed third parties about possibly assisting with stop-gap
supplies. The total effect of these developments on computer output
and prices remains uncertain, but further steep declines in computer
prices in the third quarter appear unlikely, and some potential
purchasers could be inclined to postpone spending.
Outlays for aircraft declined 23 percent at an annual rate in
the second quarter, retracing some of the strong first-quarter
advance. The news about this sector has been bleak for some time,
and Boeing expects shipments for the remainder of the year to be
20 percent below the level for the same period last year.
Continental Airlines' recent announcement of modernization plans,
which include seventeen new orders for Boeing, will not affect
shipments for two years or more. McDonnell-Douglas has received
more cancellations than orders this year and is now encouraging past
clients to refurbish older aircraft.
Business purchases of equipment excluding aircraft, computers,
and motor vehicles posted a solid increase in the second quarter.
Spurred by strong demand from automotive parts manufacturers,
outlays for metalworking machine tools advanced notably in the
second quarter and are now 16 percent above their level of a year
ago. Outlays for industrial machinery, communications equipment,

II-24
and construction machinery were all strong as well. On the
structures side, second-quarter outlays rose 4.8 percent at an
annual rate but remained depressed, at levels not seen since the
late 1970s. Expenditures rose across a broad array of categories in
the second quarter, with institutional and public utilities
investment posting double-digit growth rates.
Looking forward, orders for capital goods excluding aircraft
and computers rose 2-3/4 percent in June and have advanced steadily
since early 1992. The demand for communications equipment from both
domestic and foreign purchasers has been especially strong of late,
advancing 19 percent in the second quarter. On the whole, the
backlog of orders for other capital goods increased over the first
half of 1993, and the growth rate for shipments of other capital
goods should be healthy in the current quarter as shipments continue
to catch up to orders. The limited data in hand are consistent with
moderate growth in structures investment in the current quarter.
Both permits and contracts were up substantially in June; over the
first half of 1993, permits rose 5.5 percent and contracts were up
4.3 percent. Finally, the Baker-Hughes index of footage drilled
jumped in July, likely in response to the strength of natural gas
prices, suggesting that drilling activity is picking up after a
pause in the first and second quarters.
Business Inventories
Business inventories expanded moderately during the second
quarter. Stocks in manufacturing and trade rose at an annual rate
of about $13 billion in constant-dollar terms in April and May, and
Census surveys indicate that manufacturing and wholesale inventories
rose $3.7 billion in current-cost terms in June.5 These moderate

inventories currently reported in Census surveys appear consistent
with BEA's inventory assumptions underlying the advance GDP

II-25
buildups appear to have kept stocks broadly in line with sales.
The constant-dollar figures for April and May, as now reported,
show smaller accumulations in manufacturers' stocks than did the
estimates available at the time of the last FOMC meeting. BEA's
revision to real factory inventories in April was particularly
surprising because its direction was opposite that of the Census
Bureau's revision to the current-cost inventory change (BEA's source
data) in April; it also ran contrary to what BEA's "concurrent"
seasonal adjustment for April would suggest. BEA analysts informed
us that the downward revision was largely a result of new and higher
inventory acquisition cost indexes for the manufacturing sector,
reflecting updated estimates of monthly unit labor costs.
In manufacturing, stocks (in current costs) held by aircraft
producers posted another sizable decline in June, continuing a two-
year downtrend that likely reflects the weak market outlook for both
the commercial airline industry and defense contractors. Outside of
aircraft, manufacturers' inventory changes were mixed in June:
Accumulations of stocks at producers of industrial machinery, food
products, and apparel were partially offset by drawdowns in many
other industries. By stage of processing, a sizable rise in factory
shipments drew down finished goods inventories in June; work-in-
process stocks expanded in June, while stocks of production
materials and supplies were trimmed. The manufacturers' inventory-
to-shipments ratio fell in June to 1.47 months, one of the lowest
levels in recent years.
In the trade sector, wholesale inventories expanded moderately
in June, with stocks held by distributors of motor vehicles,

estimate. The Census retail inventory data for June will be
released on August 13.

electrical goods, and machinery showing the largest increases.
Despite declines in sales in June, inventory-to-sales ratios for
most types of wholesale establishments remained well within their
recent ranges. In retail trade, although the accumulation of
nonauto inventories as a whole was moderate in April and May, stocks
held by general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliance
(GAF) stores have posted large increases since March. The
inventory-to-sales ratio for GAF stores rose to the highest level
since January 1991, with the exception of March of this year, when
severe weather conditions distorted sales. However, GAF sales moved
up moderately in June, according to the advance data from Census,
and anecdotal reports indicate no significant imbalances in the
retail sector in July.
Federal Sector
The deficit picture for FY93 continues to look brighter, though
largely because of transitory developments such as reduced outlays
for deposit insurance. In a preliminary midyear budget update last
month, the Office of Management and Budget revised its deficit
forecast down to $285 billion, about $35 billion lower than its
April forecast. In addition to lower outlays for deposit insurance,
the lower current figure reflects elimination of the "stimulus"
outlays (except for the continuation of extended unemployment
benefits) and the investment tax credit that were part of the
President's April budget proposal. Through June, the deficit for
the fiscal year was $200 billion, a decrease of $28 billion from the
same period in the last fiscal year. Excluding deposit insurance
and the defense cooperation account, though, the fiscal year deficit
through June was $221 billion, nearly the same as last year.
Receipts for the fiscal year through June grew moderately
overall, but corporate receipts showed particular strength, with a

II-30
16 percent increase over the same period last year. The increase in
corporate receipts partly reflects stronger corporate profits, but
it also reflects tightened provisions for payment of corporate
estimated taxes, which require corporations to pay more of their
estimated tax liability earlier in the year. Personal income and
social insurance taxes together grew about 5 percent for the fiscal
year through June, relative to the same period last year.
Outlays for Medicare and health programs are still rising
rapidly, but the increases have been offset in part by falling
interest payments and the continued decline in defense spending.
Although spending in the Medicare and health category is up 10
percent for the fiscal year through June, the rate of growth
continues to be much slower than it was in the two preceding fiscal
years. Interest outlays through June are $1 billion lower than in
the previous year. After a sharp plunge in the first quarter,
nominal defense outlays rebounded in the second quarter, bringing
outlays for the fiscal year to date in line with projections made
for the year in the Fiscal Year 1994 Budget.
However, on an NIPA basis, real defense purchases declined only
about $1 billion (annual rate) in the second quarter of 1993, after
the sharp $19 billion drop in the first quarter.6 Real
nondefense purchases edged down in the second quarter and now are at
the bottom of the range for this spending category since the end of
1991.
The main legislative news, discussed in detail in an appendix
to this Greenbook, is the passage of a deficit-reduction bill by
6. Although NIPA real defense purchases edged down between the
first and second quarters of this year, defense outlays on a unified
budget basis (converted to real terms using the NIPA defense
deflator) rose. The reason for this discrepancy is that some of the
higher unified defense outlays were progress payments for certain
military procurement items that were not counted on a NIPA basis;
the NIPA convention is to exclude such outlays until the items are
completed and delivered.

the Congress and its signing by the President. In addition, both
the House and the Senate have passed a bill providing $5.5 billion
of relief to victims of the Midwestern flood. Of this, $2.4 billion
is for agricultural subsidies, $1.1 billion is for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, and $0.5 billion is for guarantees of
loans. In addition, $1.1 billion of contingency funds are available
to be spent at the President's discretion.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by the state and local
government sector are estimated to have risen at a 2.3 percent
annual rate in the second quarter, after having been about flat over
the preceding four quarters. The rise was concentrated in
construction outlays and is estimated to have held the sector's
deficit on operating and capital accounts, excluding social
insurance funds, in the $40 billion to $50 billion range that has
prevailed since late 1990 (chart). Moreover, data available since
the GDP release indicate that real construction spending was revised
up in May and jumped 3.8 percent further in June, implying a likely
upward revision to the second-quarter NIPA purchases figure.
Separate data on states and on local governments suggest that
although the fiscal condition of states may be improving, cities
continue to be plagued by shaky budgets. A recent survey of more
than 1,600 cities with populations greater than 10,000 indicates
that fiscal difficulties widened in FY93: Fifty-three percent of
the cities reported that spending would exceed receipts during
fiscal 1993, whereas 46 percent reported that spending had exceeded
receipts in fiscal 1992 (chart). Factors contributing importantly
to the budget problems included city employee health benefits,
infrastructure needs, and unfunded federal and state mandates.

Disproportionately, cities in rural areas and in the Western and
Midwestern census regions reported more difficulties.
Midwestern states and cities will no doubt be set back by the
need to repair levees, roads, and other infrastructure after
flooding subsides. Many local governments are expecting financial
support from the states and, especially, the federal government, but
it is too early to assess the cost of repairs. According to rating
agencies, changes in the credit ratings of affected governments will
be determined on a case-by-case basis. Credit ratings depend
largely on long-term considerations, and downgrades could result if
projected revenue streams, such as user fees generated by a utility,
are adversely affected. At this time, however, widespread
downgradings are not expected.
Prices
In June, the overall consumer price index was unchanged, and
the index excluding food and energy rose just 0.1 percent. This
marked the second month of small increases, with the May CPI up just
0.1 percent. Over the second quarter (from March to June), the CPI
rose just 2-1/4 percent at an annual rate, compared with 4 percent
in the first quarter of the year.
Declines in prices of tobacco and apparel helped hold down both
the overall CPI and the rate of core inflation in June. Tobacco
prices fell 1-1/2 percent as price cuts announced in April were put
in place by the cigarette manufacturers. Apparel prices fell at a
4-1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter after moving up at
an 8 percent rate in the first quarter. Among other goods, new car
prices rose just 0.2 percent in June and have risen 2-1/4 percent
7. In late July, Fitch Investors Service Inc. upgraded
Minnesota's general obligation rating to AAA, noting the state's
healthy financial position; although analysts are anticipating some
losses, they did not feel that the flood would have a major effect
on the state's budget picture.

over the past twelve months. Increases in prices of services were
also modest in June, with the CPI for services other than energy up
just 0.2 percent. Owners' equivalent rent rose 0.4 percent, but
this was offset by declines for out-of-town lodging, auto finance
charges, and air fares.
Over the first six months of 1993, the CPI excluding food and
energy rose 3.6 percent at an annual rate, the same as in the first
six months of last year. Comparing these periods, price inflation
for commodities other than food and energy was lower this year than
last: 2-1/2 percent versus 3-1/4 percent. In contrast, prices of
services other than energy rose 4-1/4 percent in the first half of
1993, compared with 3-3/4 percent in the first half of 1992. Within
services, owners' equivalent rent is responsible for a sizable
portion of the pickup, with prices increasing at a 3-3/4 percent
annual rate over the first six months of the year, compared with a
3-1/4 percent annual rate in the first six months of 1992. Also,
auto finance charges have not fallen as rapidly in 1993 as they did
in 1992, because interest rate declines have been less pronounced
this year. And, the deceleration of prices for medical care
services stalled in the first part of 1993, with an increase of
7-1/4 percent at an annual rate in the first six months of the year,
compared with 7-1/2 percent in the first six months of 1992. (By
comparison, medical services prices had come down sharply in 1991
and 1992 from an increase of 10 percent in 1990.)
Energy prices in the CPI edged down 0.2 percent in June
following a 1 percent drop in May. Gasoline prices fell 1 percent
in June and are down 4-1/2 percent since February, owing mainly to
an easing in crude oil costs. However, the CPI for natural gas
posted a 1-1/2 percent increase in June, the fourth consecutive
large monthly increase. Natural gas prices moved up sharply early

this year as reduced supplies after last winter's unusually cold
weather combined with an ongoing increase in demand for natural gas
for generation of electricity due to the requirements of the 1990
Clean Air Act. In recent months, natural gas futures prices have
edged off their late winter highs but remain at an elevated level.
The CPI for food fell 0.4 percent in June, pulled down by a
drop of nearly 6 percent in prices of fresh fruits and vegetables;
prices of tomatoes and lettuce plunged 18 percent and 27 percent,
respectively. The drop in fruit and vegetable prices more than
reversed a sizable jump in May. So far this year, fruit and
vegetable prices are down 2 percent, on net, helping to keep the
index for food to a modest 2 percent annual pace, up only a little
from the pace of 1991 and 1992.
Some pickup from this low rate of food price inflation may be
in the offing, however, as the combination of flooding in the
Midwest and drought in some other regions has led to widespread
reports of crop damage and increased price volatility in a number of
farm markets. The prices of corn and soybeans surged around
midyear, and although much of the increase for corn has since been
reversed, soybean prices, while also softening of late, remain
considerably higher than they were before the weather problems set
in. Crops such as peanuts and processed vegetables also have been
hurt by bad weather in one region or another. With crops behind
schedule in many areas, uncertainties about production and prices
may persist for several more weeks. In the livestock sector, the
futures prices for cattle dipped temporarily in mid-July, but they
since have rebounded to levels slightly above those seen at midyear.
Futures prices for hogs jumped in early July in response to a USDA
report that showed herds to be smaller than traders had expected:
additional price firming that took place later in July has been

II-38
largely offset by price declines in recent trading sessions.
Traders may be anticipating that pork producers will slow expansion
plans until the remaining uncertainties about crop production and
feed supplies are resolved.

Just how strongly food prices overall will be affected by the
current problems in farming remains to be seen. In 1983 and 1988--
two other recent years in which major crop damage occurred--food
price inflation picked up noticeably, but with considerable
variation in the speed at which initial price shocks made their way
through to retail (table). During 1983, for example, food prices
rose less rapidly than they had in the previous year, and
acceleration in 1984 did not raise food price increases even to the
level of core inflation. By contrast, the 1988 episode led to a
quick acceleration of food price increases, and the rate of food
price rise exceeded core inflation by a percentage point or so over
an extended period. Even in the latter instance, however, food
price acceleration was not so extreme as to dramatically alter the
general inflation picture.

goods prices fell 0.1 percent in June, the best monthly outcome
since last fall. A 6 percent drop in tobacco prices more than
accounted for the decline, but apparel prices fell as well.
Producer prices of apparel have fallen on net thus far this year,
after rising 2 percent in 1992. Over the first six months of 1993,
producer prices of finished goods other than food and energy rose
2.4 percent at an annual rate, compared with 2.7 percent over the
first six months of last year. Prices of intermediate materials
other than food and energy have risen at a 2.1 percent pace so far
this year, compared with 1.2 percent for all of 1992 and 1.8 percent
in the first six months of last year.

The Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials prices,
which fell moderately during the first half of 1993, has changed
little, on net, since the June Greenbook. Price changes for
industrial metals have been mixed, with this week's price quotes for
copper and steel scrap up a little from the midyear levels but
prices of aluminum and tin down slightly. Flatness also has been
evident in the CRB index of industrial materials prices. However,
more substantial upward pressures have been evident in some other
measures of commodity prices--notably the CRB futures index and the
Dow-Jones spot price index. These measures, which give heavy weight
to agricultural products and precious metals, were boosted in July
by weather-related increases of the prices of farm crops and by
sharp advances in the prices of gold and silver. With crop prices
softening in early August and gold and silver off sharply, the two
indexes have recently reversed a portion of the July increases.
Labor Costs
Increases in labor costs remained stable through mid-year. As
measured by the employment cost index (ECI), hourly compensation for
private industry workers rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate over the
March to June period, little different from the average rate of
increase during the preceding year. Overall trends in both the wage
and salary and the benefit components of the index were little
changed. Wages in manufacturing trended lower over the year ending
in June, but the slowing was offset by a firming in wages in
retailing and in finance, insurance, and real estate. The growth of
employer costs for health care decelerated noticeably in the past
year. However, the increase in costs of legally required benefits
has accelerated; in particular, states have raised employer premiums
for state unemployment insurance to reflect firms' experience
ratings and to replenish low U.I. funds. Moreover, supplemental pay

and contributions to retirement and savings plans have increased--
the latter apparently because of the impact of low interest rates on
those plans. The acceleration in these components of benefits
appears to have had a differential impact on manufacturers, whose
benefit costs rose more rapidly in the past year than in the
preceding twelve months.
In the state and local sector, the ECI for hourly compensation
increased a bit less rapidly than in private industry over the
twelve months ended in June. Compensation growth slowed
dramatically in the state and local sector in 1990 and 1991, but, as
in private industry, it has leveled off thereafter.
By bargaining status, compensation increases for union workers
outpaced gains by nonunion workers in the second quarter, continuing
the pattern seen over the past few years. As with private industry
workers as a whole, compensation costs for union workers have
leveled off. Wages in the union sector, however, have continued to
decelerate: The ECI for wages and salaries for union workers
increased 2.8 percent over the twelve months ended in June. down
from 3.5 percent over the preceding twelve-month period.
Separate data on major union settlements (covering 1,000 or
more workers) also show continued deceleration in union wages. The
effective wage change series--which is conceptually similar to the
ECI--increased 2.9 percent over the four quarters ended in June,
down from 3.3 percent over the previous four quarters. Deferred
adjustments under prior settlements accounted for the majority of
those overall union wage increases. Looking to the future, new
second-quarter settlements called for wage adjustments averaging
2.7 percent annually over the life of the contract. This increase
is somewhat less than the increases posted in the first quarter and

II-48
in 1992, and is considerably less than when the same parties
8
bargained two to three years ago.
The only third-quarter labor cost data available are average
hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, which rose
0.2 percent in July, reversing a similar decline in June. Over the
past twelve months, average hourly earnings have increased
2.4 percent, virtually unchanged from the pace recorded over the
preceding twelve-month period.

APPENDIX
THE OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1993
President Clinton has signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993, which was passed by the Congress last week. The
legislation implements much of the President's budgetary plan and is
estimated to reduce the deficit by a cumulative $496 billion over
the fiscal years 1994-1998. It is broadly consistent with the
Budget Resolution passed last spring.
The Reconciliation Agreement and the Budget Outlook
The House and Senate Budget committees estimate that the
reconciliation agreement will reduce the budget deficit by amounts
that grow from $47 billion in fiscal 1994 to nearly $150 billion in
fiscal 1998 (table 1). The deficit changes are measured relative to
a baseline that incorporates the reductions in defense spending in
President Bush's January 1992 budget request but that holds the
rest of the budget at "current services" levels.1 All told, the
cumulative deficit reduction over the five years is projected to be
$496 billion, comprising $190 billion from changes in spending
(other than debt service), $241 billion from revenue increases, and
$66 billion from savings in debt service (reflecting both the
effects of lower levels of debt and changes in debt management
policies).
After the savings from the reconciliation agreement are built
in, the deficit is projected to drop steadily from $285 billion in
fiscal 1993 to less than $200 billion in fiscal 1996 before moving
up to about $230 billion by fiscal 1998. By comparison, the
baseline deficit is estimated to remain around $300 billion through
fiscal 1996 and to rise appreciably thereafter, to about $380
billion in fiscal 1998.
Spending Provisions
The reconciliation agreement will bring about a shift in the
composition of federal spending over the fiscal 1994-98 period and
is projected to lower the rate of growth of spending, on average,
about 1 percentage point per year. Relative to the baseline
described above, the agreement is expected to achieve savings of
$256 billion over this period: $102 billion is expected to come
from caps on discretionary spending, $88 billion from reductions in
1. The baseline deficit shown in table 1 is the Administration's
mid-July preliminary update of its projection for the Mid-Session
Review, which has been delayed to incorporate the reconciliation
bill. Congressional projections of the deficit, which are based on
baseline estimates prepared by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
last March, differ slightly and are shown as a memo item in the
table. Estimates of deficit reduction were prepared by CBO and the
Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT).
2. In the main, the upward tilt in the deficit after the mid-
1990s reflects the combination of continued large increases in
outlays for health care and the slowing of real GDP growth in the
underlying economic forecast. As President Clinton noted when he
released his budgetary program last winter, he expects savings from
health care reform to help keep the budget deficit on a downward
track. Moreover, the President and several members of the Congress
have agreed to consider further spending reductions later this year.

entitlement programs, and $66 billion from lower debt service costs
(table 2).
With respect to discretionary (annually appropriated) spending,
the reconciliation agreement reaffirms the caps specified by the
1990 budget act for fiscal 1994-95 and sets caps on spending for
fiscal 1996-98. The new caps hold nominal spending at its fiscal
1993 level and imply an average decline in real spending of
about 3 percent per year.3
Although the caps for the fiscal 1994-98 period apply to
discretionary spending in total (separate caps for defense and other
categories ended in fiscal 1993), with the actual programmatic
changes to be worked out in yearly appropriations, defense is
expected to account for virtually all of the savings. Notably, in
The Budget for Fiscal Year 1994, President Clinton proposed to hold
nondefense discretionary spending about even in real terms over the
next five years, whereas defense spending was slated to fall by
fiscal 1998 to a level about 12 percent below that proposed by
President Bush in 1992. Such a level of defense spending in fiscal
1998 would be about 20 percent below that needed to maintain 1993's
real funding level.
The reconciliation agreement also includes $88 billion in
entitlement cuts over the five years, with around two-thirds of the
reductions coming from Medicare. The savings in Medicare come
primarily from restraints on payments to health care providers and,
after 1995, from higher premiums for Supplementary Medical Insurance
(SMI). The savings are expected to cumulate to $56 billion over the
next five years, but Medicare outlays still are expected to grow
approximately 10 percent per year, on average, over the period.
3. Because the nominal caps will be adjusted in future years for
unanticipated changes in inflation, the agreement, in effect,
establishes a path for real spending.

1. Earned income tax credit. Outlay effect only; also entails a
five-year revenue loss of $2 billion.
Other significant savings are estimated to come from reductions
in Medicaid, changes in federal retirement policies (mainly by
eliminating the "lump-sum" retirement option), the introduction of
competitive bidding for the use of the telecommunications spectrum
(the proceeds are treated as an offset to outlays), and reform of
the student loan program. The student loan reforms will phase in
the replacement of guaranteed student loans by direct government
loans (until they account for half of new lending) and impose fees
on banks and other institutions.
The agreement contains a substantial expansion of the earned
income tax credit (EITC), which has been touted by the President as
a first step in the reform of assistance to low-income families.
The agreement also increases funding for food stamps and a variety
of child welfare and health programs.
Revenue Provisions
According to congressional estimates, the changes to the tax
laws are estimated to narrow the deficit, on net, $26 billion in
fiscal 1994 and a cumulative $241 billion over the five years (table
3). The distribution of tax burdens also shifts appreciably:
Upper-income individuals and businesses generally will face higher
liabilities, while most middle- and low-income individuals will see
little change in their overall tax payments. In addition to new
initiatives, the package extends several expiring provisions, but
the extensions have only a small effect on the deficit.
4. According to the JCT, taxpayers earning $200,000 or more will
see an increase in their total tax liabilities equal to 5.4 percent
of their incomes while those earning less than $10,000 will see a
decrease equal to 1.3 percent of income. Tax burdens of other
groups are estimated to change by less than 1 percent of income.
These calculations include the change to the outlay portion of the
EITC.

1. Revenue effect only; also adds $1 billion to outlays over five
years.
Upper-income individuals will pay higher income and social
insurance taxes. The increase in income taxes is accomplished
through (1) the addition of a fourth (36 percent) bracket for taxable
incomes of more than $140,000 (joint returns) and $115,000 (single
returns), (2) the imposition of a 10 percent surtax on the portion of
taxable income that exceeds $250,000 (on both joint and single
returns), (3) the permanent extension of provisions that limit the
itemized deductions and phase out the personal exemptions claimed by
high-income taxpayers, and (4) adjustments to the provisions
concerning the alternative minimum tax. These provisions change
liabilities for 1993, but affected taxpayers will be able to pay this
year's additional taxes in installments over the 1994-96 period.
Moreover, beginning in 1994, the wage-base cap on Medicare taxes
(currently $135,000) will be repealed. (Upper-income persons also
will be affected by new limits on contributions to 401(k) and other
5. According to staff estimates, these changes are likely to
affect only about 10 percent of individual returns reporting
business income. Partnerships and Subchapter-S corporations account
for about one-third of individually reported business income, and
almost all of their income is reported on affected returns. The
remaining two-thirds of individually reported business income is
earned by sole proprietors; roughly one-fifth of sole-proprietorship
income is on affected returns.

qualified retirement plans as well by higher rates on estate and gift
taxes.)
All told, the marginal tax rate on the wage income of taxpayers
with total taxable incomes of more than $250,000 rises from 31
percent under current law to 42.5 percent, taking account of both the
higher rates of individual taxation and the combined employer and
employee share of Medicare; the maximum statutory rate on realized
capital gains, however, remains at 28 percent.
In addition, beginning in 1994, a greater share of social
security benefits will be subject to income tax. Currently, married
taxpayers whose incomes (calculated as the sum of adjusted gross
income plus tax-exempt interest income plus one-half of social
security benefits) are at least $32,000 ($25,000 for single
taxpayers) must include up to 50 percent of social security benefits
(depending on income) in taxable income. The new law introduces a
second test that raises the maximum share of benefits subject to tax
to 85 percent. The provision will begin to bite for married
taxpayers with incomes of $44,000 ($34,000 for single taxpayers);
those with incomes below the new thresholds will be unaffected.
On the business side, the agreement raises the corporate tax
rate from 34 percent to 35 percent on taxable incomes of more than
$10 million; the higher liabilities begin in 1993, but payments will
not be required until 1994. Also, beginning in January, the
deductible portion of business meals and entertainment will be
reduced from 80 percent to 50 percent; deductions for a variety of
other items, including executive compensation in excess of $1
million, will be limited or eliminated.
The other key revenue-raising provision in the reconciliation
agreement is a 4.3 cents per gallon increase in the tax on
transportation fuels, including gasoline and diesel fuel, on October
1, 1993 (commercial aviation fuel will be exempt for two years). The
agreement also extends the 2.5 cents per gallon portion of the
current gasoline tax scheduled to expire on September 30, 1995.
Although the major investment incentives proposed by the
President in February have been dropped, the reconciliation agreement
contains numerous smaller initiatives. Notably, small businesses now
will be able to expense up to $17,500 of expenditures on capital
equipment each year (compared with $10,000 currently), and the
research and experimentation (R&E) credit is extended. In addition,
stockholders in certain new firms will be able to exclude 50 percent
of capital gains on investments held at least five years; the five-
year revenue loss from this provision is less than $1 billion.
Finally, the legislation provides funding for the creation of
nine empowerment zones and ninety-five enterprise communities. Among
other things, employees who work and live in the designated
enterprise zones will receive credits equal to 20 percent of the
first $15,000 of qualified wages, and businesses locating in these
areas will be able to take advantage of favorable expensing
provisions.
6. These calculations are approximate and do not take into
account the limits on itemized deductions, deductibility of the
employer share of Medicare taxes, and state income taxes.

II-A-6
Budget Process and Executive Orders
The Reconciliation Act extends the 1990 budget enforcement law
through fiscal 1998 and contains provisions designed to facilitate
sustained deficit reduction. As noted above, the act sets caps on
discretionary spending through fiscal 1998 that are consistent with
the Budget Resolution; it also continues the existing sequester
mechanism and the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) system governing mandatory
spending and revenues. However, it adjusts the PAYGO structure to
ensure that none of the deficit reduction in the reconciliation bill
can be "spent" to finance increases in mandatory spending or
reductions in taxes. Also, the President signed an executive order
on August 4 creating a new Deficit Reduction Fund. A second order
established procedures that the Administration will have to follow in
the event that mandatory spending exceeds its projections; notably,
the Administration will have to acknowledge the overrun and offer a
plan for dealing with it.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Short- and intermediate-term interest rates have recorded only
small changes on net since the July FOMC meeting. Rates generally
backed up a bit as market participants perceived the Chairman's
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony as signaling a greater likelihood of
policy tightening. However, with economic data suggesting no
accumulation of inflation pressures, and with the passage of the
deficit-reduction package, rates have generally fallen back,
especially long-term rates. Indeed, the thirty-year Treasury bond
rate has dropped about 1/4 percentage point on net to a new record
low below 6-1/2 percent. Most major stock price indexes have risen
1-1/2 percent to 3 percent over the intermeeting period.
Households apparently continued to shift their portfolios
toward assets outside the monetary aggregates--particularly stock
and bond mutual funds--and the growth of the broad monetary
aggregates weakened slightly further in July. Bank credit presented
a mixed picture: Consumer and real estate loans registered solid
growth; however, business loans contracted after two months of
expansion even as banks reportedly have become more willing to lend.
The pattern of financial flows has continued to reflect efforts
of businesses to restructure balance sheets and to take advantage of
low long-term interest rates. Firms continued to issue large
volumes of bonds--some with unusually long maturities--and used the
bulk of the proceeds to refinance existing debt, evidently including
bank loans. As stock prices extended their ascent, equity issuance
remained strong as well. Demand for mortgages to finance home
purchases appears to have picked up, but loan originations have been
dominated by another surge in refinancing activity. Paced by
substantial increases in auto and revolving installment loans,
overall consumer credit advanced at a moderate rate in the second

quarter, and bank data for July point to a another solid gain last
month.
In the public sector, state and local governments again issued
large volumes of bonds, especially for refunding purposes. The
Treasury has continued its reliance on shorter-term bill and coupon
offerings and, as previously announced, inaugurated a semiannual
schedule for auctions of thirty-year bonds. The Treasury is
expected to borrow $54 billion during the third quarter, about on
par with the pace through the first half of 1993.
Money and Bank Credit
Although temporarily obscured by special factors in May and
June, the fundamental forces impeding the growth of the broad
monetary aggregates in recent quarters became more apparent in July.
M2 growth in July slowed to about 1 percent at an annual rate,
placing it just below the new lower bound of its annual target
range. Despite a decline in long-term rates, households have
continued to tilt the composition of their portfolios toward longer-
term, higher-risk assets outside the monetary aggregates. Most
notably, anecdotal reports suggest a repeat in July of the strong
inflows to stock and bond funds of recent months. M3 contracted in
July at a 2 percent pace as banks continued to meet additional
funding needs largely by issuing liabilities that are not included
in the monetary aggregates. More rapid growth of demand deposits,
1. The deceleration of M2 occurred despite a boost resulting from
the acquisition of a primary dealer firm by a large bank.
Currently, the primary dealership is structured as a subsidiary of
the bank; ultimately, the bank is expected to place the dealer in
its "Section 20" subsidiary of the bank holding company. Because
the acquired dealer is, for the moment, part of the bank, its
overnight and term RPs are included in the monetary aggregates.
Estimates suggest that the inclusion of these RPs added $4-1/2
billion to the level of M2 and $5 billion to the level of M3 in
July. On the asset side, the merger is estimated to have added
about $7-1/4 billion to bank security holdings and another $3-1/2
billion to security loans last month. These increases will be
reversed when the dealer becomes a separate subsidiary of the bank
holding company.

likely spurred by prepayments on mortgage-backed securities
resulting from the latest refinancing surge, helped push Ml growth
to a 14 percent pace in July.
Buoyed significantly by a bank's acquisition of a primary
dealer firm, bank credit advanced at a 7-3/4 percent annual
rate--down somewhat from the pace recorded in May and June but still
well above the trend growth of the last three years. Excepting this
merger, bank credit in July would have expanded at only about half
that pace. Consumer and real estate loans were unaffected by the
merger and showed genuine strength, advancing in July at 12 percent
and 3-3/4 percent annual rates, respectively. Growth in real estate
loans accorded with the pickup in home sales. Home equity loans
declined in July, suggesting that households may have used some of
the proceeds from mortgage refinancings to pay down home equity
debt. In contrast to the upbeat tone in the consumer and real
estate lending data, business loans declined in July at a 3-1/4
percent rate. In part, the decline in business loans may reflect
substitution of capital market funding for bank loans by some
businesses and perhaps a reduced need to finance inventories.
Business loans at small banks declined in July, following a smaller
runoff in June. Only foreign banks recorded any business loan
growth last month. European banks, with ample capital and likely
facing weak loan demand in their domestic market, accounted for most
of the increase in business loans. Japanese banks, still facing
capital pressures, continued to retrench.
Depository Institutions
Banks continued to enjoy robust earnings in the second quarter.
Partial information for the top twenty-five banking companies
indicates that net interest margins, albeit still high, may have
begun to narrow a bit. Profits remain substantial, augmented by

III-6
gains from securities and foreign exchange trading and from fee
generating activities. Shares of money center banks appeared to
respond favorably to earnings reports, rising appreciably over the
intermeeting period; share prices for other banks were little
changed. Improved profitability, along with continued issuance of
equity and subordinated debt, has boosted capital at most banks to
levels well in excess of regulatory minimums. Some banks may be
building extra capital in anticipation of future acquisitions, while
others may still be responding to various regulatory and market
incentives to maintain strong capital bases. However, there are
signs that some banks may be beginning to deploy their excess
capital by extending new loans. Indeed, preliminary information
from the August Bank Lending Practices Survey (BLPS) indicates that
banks which are comfortable with their capital position tend also to
be pursuing loans more aggressively.
Data on loan rates appear consistent with the view that banks
are attempting to be more competitive in certain market sectors.
For example, data from the Survey of Terms of Business Lending
(chart) indicate that spreads on rates for large loans relative to
the federal funds rate have narrowed in 1993. Similarly, data from
other sources on the pricing of large syndicated loans also suggest
that spreads have narrowed in 1993. The August BLPS indicates that
a considerable number of banks have eased standards for approving
new C&I loans, especially for large- and medium-sized credits, and a
large share of the respondents reported easing of loan terms such as
credit line fees and spreads.
Although a significant number of problem thrifts remain,
anecdotal reports indicate that the profitability of the industry
overall is gradually improving. The improved earnings of S&Ls have

been incorporated in their share prices, which generally have
tracked the upward trajectory of bank stocks in recent months. Some
S&Ls have opted to abandon their S&L charter in favor of a federal
or state savings bank charter. The federal savings bank charter
allows S&Ls to market themselves as FDIC-insured rather than SAIF-
insured. The move to a state savings bank charter has been
popular among S&Ls chafing under the supervision of OTS--the FDIC is
the primary federal regulator for state savings banks. Despite the
lack of new funds from Congress, the RTC was able to resolve a few
small institutions in May and June by tapping its reserve fund.
3. This is largely a marketing device--deposit insurance
assessments for these institutions are split between BIF and SAIF on
the basis of their status before the change in charter. Although
there is not much difference between the deposit rates offered by
S&Ls and those of savings banks, some S&Ls may find the change in
charter allows them to attract or retain customers more easily.

These small resolutions required only minor outlays of loss funds.
It is still unclear whether Congress will approve additional funding
for the RTC to complete the thrift cleanup.
Business Finance
The familiar pattern in business borrowing during recent
quarters was again evident during the intermeeting period:
Businesses continued to strengthen their balance sheets and cash
flows by issuing large volumes of longer-term debt and equities, and
using the proceeds to retire higher-cost outstanding debt. Issuers
have moved to lock in funding costs for the long term as long
maturity rates have fallen to twenty-year lows, and investors are
continuing to "reach for yield" by lengthening the maturity of their
portfolios and accepting greater risk.
In July, Walt Disney and Coca-Cola took the trend toward long-
term debt issuance a step further, becoming the first firms in forty
years to issue U.S. public bonds having hundred-year maturities.
Yields on the bonds came in roughly 25 to 35 basis points higher
than yields on thirty-year bonds issued by corporations with similar
ratings. Disney and Coca-Cola were not alone in exploring the far
frontier of the maturity spectrum. Also in July, Pacific Bell
became the fifth corporation this year to sell a fifty-year bond.
Indeed, during the first half of 1993, 36 percent of investment-
grade bonds issued by nonfinancial corporations have had maturities
of thirty years or longer, the highest percentage since 1987.
Moreover, long-term debt offerings have not been limited to
investment-grade bonds; Cablevision Systems (B2/B) issued a thirty-
year bond in April, and Time Warner (Ba2/BBB-) issued a forty-year
bond in July.
Investors' willingness to accept more risk in return for higher
yields is evident in the strength of the junk bond market. Junk

III-10
bond issuance remained strong in July, and if it continues at its
current pace, junk bond volume in 1993 will exceed the $42 billion
record set in 1986. The character of junk bond financing in the
1990s has generally differed from that in the 1980s. Companies have
been using the proceeds from offerings primarily to pay down high
coupon bonds and bank loans rather than to finance mergers and LBOs.
Recently, however, junk quality appears to have deteriorated, as
evidenced by a higher volume of subordinated offerings, a decline in
the credit quality of new issuers, and a reemergence of relatively
risky pay-in-kind and zero coupon structures.
Investors in the speculative-grade market have become more
receptive to first-time issuers, which generally have smaller
financing requirements than companies that had previously accessed
the public bond market. Secondary market yields on many junk bonds
have fallen below 10 percent, and spreads to Treasury securities are
at their lowest level since early 1989, before the market collapsed.
After posting substantial declines during the early months of
1993, commercial paper has grown at nearly a 20 annual percent rate
since May. Some corporate borrowers reportedly have issued
commercial paper this year while awaiting still lower long-term
rates. In addition, a portion of the growth in commercial paper
during July owed to borrowing by the government of Denmark,
Finally, some of the
additional commercial paper issued may have been used for basic
business purposes. Commercial paper issuers have found the markets
receptive; yields spreads relative to Treasury bills are quite
narrow, and spreads between A-2/P-2 and A-1/P-1 commercial paper
have fallen to their narrowest point since the SEC proposed its
amendment to rule 2a-7 three years ago.

III-11
Net equity issuance in July slipped only slightly from the very
robust pace of the first half of 1993. The continued heavy flow of
new equity issues likely owes to the buoyant stock market and
perhaps to attempts by many businesses to secure a favorable market
reception for new long-term debt issues. The staff estimates that
net equity issuance by nonfinancial firms amounted to $32 billion
(annual rate) in the second quarter, compared with $29 billion in
the first quarter. The market for initial public offerings has
remained robust; nonfinancial firms raised more than $1.5 billion in
June and reportedly maintained that pace in July.
Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term, tax-exempt bonds was strong again
in July, with most issuance earmarked for refunding of existing
debt. Through the first seven months of this year, long-term volume
is on a pace that, if maintained, would exceed last year's record
volume by almost 40 percent. Indeed, refunding issuance in 1993 has

already established a new annual high. By contrast, new capital
issuance has run well behind last year's pace.
Municipal bond yields have been subject to upward pressure
since the last FOMC meeting. As a result, the ratio of the Bond
Buyer's index of revenue bond yields to the thirty-year Treasury
bond rate has jumped to its highest level since October of last
year. The increase in the ratio has occurred despite substantial
bond redemptions in July and the growing certainty of hikes in
marginal tax rates under the deficit reduction package. Market
participants report that investor demand, particularly from
municipal bond funds, has abated somewhat, after being unusually
heavy in May and June when purchasers sought to obtain bonds in
anticipation of large redemptions in July.
Changes in credit ratings for long-term municipal bonds during
the second quarter presented a mixed picture. At Standard and
Poor's, the number of downgrades exceeded the number of upgrades by
nearly a two-to-one margin, whereas at Moody's the number of
upgrades outpaced the number of downgrades by a three-to-two margin.
The difference between the two agencies stemmed partly from their
disparate treatment of so-called "moral obligation" housing bonds.
These are revenue bonds issued by state agencies for which the state
is authorized, but not required, to appropriate funds from general
revenues if needed to meet scheduled debt payments. Standard and
Poor's downgraded a number of these bonds based on its perception
that the will to meet the moral commitments had weakened in some
states suffering from slow economic growth. Moody's attaches little
weight to the moral obligation, so that firm's ratings for these
issues were largely unchanged. Apart from this difference, both
Moody's and Standard and Poor's reported deterioration in the credit
quality of health care and hospital bonds, continued improvement

III-13
among municipal utilities, and little change in general obligation
issues.
The rating agencies have focused on two concerns in their
initial evaluation of the credit ratings of local government units
affected by the flooding in the Midwest. One is the availability of
federal emergency funds to finance the reconstruction of roads,
bridges, utility plants, and other public facilities damaged by the
floods. Such losses generally are not covered by insurance, and the
absence of adequate federal assistance could impair the financial
condition of affected municipalities. The other concern is the
longer-term impact of the flood on local tax bases. Municipal bond
dealers indicate that yields on securities of issuers within the
flood region have not yet shown any reaction. The rating agencies
have not yet published any downgrades as a result of the flood.
California's 1994 budget received a vote of confidence last
month as the rating agencies affirmed their earlier ratings of the
state's bonds: double-A from Moody's and A-plus from Standard and
Poor's. Although the state remains vulnerable to further economic
setbacks, the agencies concluded that it had taken appropriate steps
to keep the budget in balance and to generate funds necessary to
eliminate the $2.8 billion deficit carried over from previous years.
The city of Los Angeles received less favorable treatment; Moody's
lowered its Aaa rating to Aal in late July. The downgrading
reflected a number of factors including losses of tax revenues
resulting from the depressed local economy.
Treasury Financing
The staff anticipates that the Treasury will finance a
projected $63 billion third-quarter fiscal deficit by borrowing $48
billion in the market and by drawing down its cash balance by $13
billion. Nonmarketable borrowing is expected to be negligible; the

III-14
lowering of guaranteed rates earlier this year has slowed savings
bond growth, and state and local government series bonds (SLGS) have
been running off as municipalities have increasingly invested the
proceeds of advance refunding operations in eligible, higher-
yielding instruments. The recently passed budget bill included a
permanent increase in the debt ceiling to $4.9 trillion, thereby
avoiding possible disruptions at the end of September when the
temporary debt ceiling of $4.4 trillion was due to expire. At the
end of July, debt subject to the limit totaled $4.3 trillion.

Most third-quarter marketable borrowing is expected to be in
the coupon sector, with gross auction sizes generally unchanged to
up $500 million.4 An exception to this pattern will be the gross
size of the thirty-year bond auction. As part of its move to a
semiannual auction schedule for thirty-year bonds, the Treasury
auctioned $11 billion of thirty-year bonds in the August midquarter
refunding, up $2-3/4 billion from the May auction; the next auction
of thirty-year securities will be held in February, and the annual
volume of bonds offered in the twice-yearly auctions is expected to
be about 40 percent lower than the volume issued under the quarterly
schedule. The August midquarter refunding, which also included
$16-1/2 billion of three-year notes and $11 billion of ten-year
notes, raised a total of about $11.8 billion in cash. The gross
size of the weekly Treasury bill auctions is expected to rise from
the current level of $24.4 billion to $24.8 billion.
The Treasury completed the eleventh round of single-price
auctions of two- and five-year notes in July. Thus far, the single-
price auctions have resulted in an average markup of 1 basis point
over when-issued rates; in comparison, the average markup of auction
average rates for a sample of discriminating price auctions was
about 1/2 basis point. Dealer awards as a fraction of total awards
at single-price auctions have been little changed from that typical
of discriminating-price auctions; evidently, single-price auctions
have not yet significantly expanded the role of nondealers at
Treasury auctions. The Treasury announced plans to continue the
experiment with single-price auctions for another year to provide
additional data for analysis and evaluation.
4. Of course, to finance the deficit, gross auction sizes are
substantially larger than maturing issues.

Mortgage Markets
As in other financial sectors, much of the activity in mortgage
markets has been associated with the actions of households and
businesses to refinance existing debt at lower rates. Interest
rates on conventional thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which
generally track the ten-year Treasury note, were about unchanged
since the last FOMC meeting; however, at about 7-1/4 percent, they
remain twenty-five basis points below their average for the second
quarter. The generally low level of rates has led to another surge
of refinancings, with the Mortgage Bankers Association index of
refinancing applications again approaching record highs in recent
weeks (chart). Staff analysis suggests that households' efforts to
reduce the interest costs of mortgage debt have been quite
successful. Depending on various assumptions, estimates of total
interest savings in 1993 range between $12 billion and $21 billion,
with most of the savings associated with refinancing of fixed-rate
mortgages.
As a result of heavy refinancing of residential mortgages,
gross issuance of agency pass-through securities returned to near-
record levels in the second quarter, amounting to just over $130
billion on a not seasonally adjusted basis (chart). However, partly
reflecting $23 billion of purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
for their own portfolios during the first half of 1993, gross
issuance was barely enough to offset total retirements, resulting in
net issuance for the quarter of only $1.5 billion. Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac have been able to boost their net interest income by
expanding their portfolios over the past year. Combined with
5. Estimates of interest savings due to refinancings are based
on expected total refinancings completed in 1993 and an estimate of
the average interest rate reduction. Total interest savings also
include an estimate of the impact of lower rates on existing
adjustable rate mortgages.

Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit rebounded sharply in June
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12-1/4 percent after a small
decline in May; growth for the second quarter as a whole was at a
4-1/2 percent rate. slightly below the revised first-quarter pace of
5 percent. Second-quarter growth was held down by the sale of a
large portfolio of consumer loans by a finance company to an entitylarge portfolio of consumer loans by a tinance company to an entity

III-19
outside the scope of the consumer credit statistics. This
transaction removed about $3 billion from the measured stock of
installment credit in May; without that downward shift in
outstanding credit, the rate of growth in the second quarter would
have risen to about 6 percent. Total credit, which includes the
small but volatile noninstallment credit component, expanded at a
3-1/2 percent pace in the the second quarter, about the same as in
in the first quarter.
After softening over the previous three months, revolving
credit grew at a 13 percent pace in June. Smoothing through the
monthly volatility, revolving credit advanced at about an 8 percent
pace through midyear. Stronger household balance sheets, as
evidenced by reduced levels of scheduled debt service payments
relative to income and by generally lower delinquency rates, have
probably made people more comfortable about increasing the amount of
their revolving debt. Sharply reduced interest rates in some
segments of the credit card market and the promotion of several
rebate-type incentive programs also have likely stimulated growth in
revolving credit.
A pickup in sales at auto dealers has contributed to a
turnaround in the growth of auto credit since late last year.
Increased car sales have boosted new credit extensions well in
excess of repayments on auto debt outstanding. Auto credit expanded
at a 10 percent rate in June and has grown at a 5 percent annual
rate since its trough in October 1992.
Auto credit growth this year has been damped somewhat by the
growing popularity of leasing arrangements at the expense of
traditional installment loans. According to industry estimates,
approximately one in four new passenger cars acquired by individuals
thus far in 1993 has been leased. The proportion of leased cars

grew fairly sharply from 1987 through 1991 and has edged a bit
higher over the past several quarters. Auto manufacturers actively
promoted car sales during the 1987-91 period by offering attractive
lease terms (low implicit interest rates and high residual values),
much as they offered below-market interest rates on loans in the
early and mid-1980s. More recently, the scaling back of these
special lease programs, along with historically low interest rates
on bank and finance company loans, have slowed the shift to leasing.

Merchandise Trade
The merchandise trade deficit in May was $8.4 billion
(seasonally-adjusted, Census-basis), much smaller than the deficits
of March and April, but still above the levels recorded in the
previous six months. Exports rose slightly from April to May, as
increases in industrial supplies, machinery, and consumer goods
offset declines in agricultural products, automotive vehicles and
parts, and civilian aircraft. A drop in imports from April to May
was attributable to a wide range of products, particularly
automotive products, consumer goods, and oil.

Exports for April/May combined recovered from a first-quarter
decline, with the increase in exports consisting almost entirely of
non-agricultural products. Most of the increase in exports went to
Canada, and only part of this was automotive products. Exports to
Japan fell slightly, while exports to the EC countries tumbled,
reflecting those nations' slow growth and recessions. By product,
the most notable increase in April/May was in exports of machinery;
since the second quarter of last year, machinery exports have
expanded about twice as fast as overall non-agricultural exports.
Imports in April/May were nearly 4 percent higher than in the
first quarter. The increase was spread over most trade categories,
with the largest rises in machinery and oil. Robust growth in U.S.
investment expenditures has supported a steady expansion of imported
machinery since the second quarter of last year. Imports of
consumer goods and automotive products rose at a moderate pace in
April/May. By area, non-oil imports from Canada (mostly non-
automotive) and Europe accounted for most of the increase.

quantity of imported oil was associated with large increases in U.S.
stocks, and that this pattern continued in June. For both April and
May, imports amounted to more than half of U.S. consumption.
The price of imported oil averaged $17.27 per barrel in
April/May, an increase of $0.85 per barrel from the first-quarter
average, as OPEC reined-in production early in the second quarter.
More recently, oil prices fell, on balance, as it appeared more
likely that Iraq might begin oil sales under United Nations
auspices. The apparent confusion within OPEC over a strategy for
handling the return of Iraq to the world oil market also contributed
to downward price pressure. Within the past two weeks, bickering
between Saudi Arabia and Iran has kept prices low even as prospects
for Iraqi sales have faded. Currently, the near-term futures
contract for West Texas Intermediate is trading near $17.67 per
barrel. Given contract and shipping lags, the oil import unit value
should fall sharply, averaging roughly $15.60 per barrel in July.
Prices of Exports and non-Oil Imports
Non-oil import prices (BLS) declined slightly in June. For the
second quarter as a whole, prices of non-oil imports rose by 2-1/2
percent at an annual rate, reversing the decline of the first
quarter. Increases were recorded in prices of all major trade
categories, with a notable rise in the price of imported automotive
products.
Non-agricultural export prices rose by nearly 2 percent at an
annual rate in the second quarter, led by strong increases in prices
of industrial supplies, particularly building materials.
Agricultural export prices fell, though not nearly enough to reverse
the strong price increases of the first quarter.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserve assets held in the United States rose

IV-6
by $17.6 billion in the second quarter (line 4 of the Summary of
U.S. International Transactions table). An increase of over $14
billion in Japanese reserves, associated with exchange market
intervention, dominated the picture. Spanish holdings fell by $5
billion, reflecting in part Spain's efforts to replenish its mark
reserves.
In the second quarter, private foreigners purchased net $14.1
billion of corporate and U.S. agency bonds (line 2a), a substantial
increase over the first quarter; about $8 billion were for U.S.
agency bonds and $6 billion for corporates. European countries
accounted for $4.7 billion of total net purchases ($3.9 billion for
the U.K.) and residents of Japan for almost $3 billion. By
contrast, private foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks
(line 2b) and U.S. Treasury obligations (line 3) were close to zero
during the quarter.
U.S. residents continued their unprecedented net purchases of
foreign stocks and bonds (line 2c). With a total of $21 billion in
the second quarter, net purchases in the first half of 1993 ($49
billion) were nearly equal to the annual total for 1992 (a record
$50.5 billion). Stock purchases accounted for over $13 billion of
the second quarter total. As is typical, net stock purchases from
the United Kingdom, at $3.6 billion, was the largest of the country
totals; but significant net purchases from other countries were
widespread. Net purchases from Canada were $1.3 billion, from
Mexico almost $700 million, and from Japan just under $600 million.
Net foreign bond purchases were concentrated in Europe, over $10
billion from residents of the United Kingdom; net bond purchases
from Mexico continued high at $1.2 billion.
The net foreign position of banking offices in the United
States changed little during the second quarter (line 1). In July,

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the July 7 FOMC meeting, the weighted-average dollar has
risen about 1 percent. The dollar has declined nearly 4 percent
versus the Japanese yen. The yen strengthened as the U.S.-Japan
agreement on a framework for trade negotiations, reached on July 10,
failed to reduce perceived tensions between the two countries over
trade imbalances. The electoral defeat of the Liberal Democratic
Party for the first time in 38 years, and the subsequent uncertainty
over the formation of a new Japanese government, depressed the yen
only temporarily. Near the end of the period, the dollar reached a
record low of about Y103.50 following news of a further widening of
the Japanese trade surplus.
In contrast to its movement against the yen, the dollar has
risen about 1/2 percent against the mark since the July FOMC meeting
and substantially more against most other ERM currencies. Pressures
on the ERM came to a head at the end of July, prompting a decision
to greatly widen the margins of allowed currency movement around the
central parities.
German short-term interest rates moved substantially lower
during July, with three-month rates now 75 basis points lower than
on July 7, however unfavorable news about the French economy fed
expectations that French policymakers would try to reduce interest
rates faster than the Bundesbank. During July, the French franc, as
well as the Belgian franc, the Danish krone, and the Iberian
currencies, came under downward pressure relative to the mark,
forcing sharp increases in short-term interest rates in those

IV-10
countries. The Bank of France suspended its 5-to-10 day RP
facility, replacing it with an overnight RP facility and raising the
RP rate to 10 percent. Though that rate usually serves as a ceiling
to overnight market rates, a shortage of eligible collateral limited
banks' ability to borrow at the RP rate, and French overnight market
rates rose well above 10 percent.
As ERM pressures increased, market expectations developed that
the Bundesbank would respond by easing its monetary policy at a
quicker pace. In particular, market participants expected the
Bundesbank to lower its discount rate by 1/2 percentage point at its
Council meeting on July 29, leaving room for reductions in the
Bundesbank's RP rate during August. In fact, the Bundesbank left
its discount rate unchanged, precipitating a sharp rise in pressures
within the ERM.
with
the Bundesbank having indicated its unwillingness to alter its
monetary policy to reflect external considerations, European
officials met that weekend to consider ways to deal with the
currency pressures. After intensive discussions, it was finally
agreed that all the ERM currencies would be allowed to deviate as
much as 15 percent from the central parities, as opposed to the
prior allowed deviations of 2-1/4 percent for most ERM currencies
and 6 percent for the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo. In
a side agreement, the German and Dutch central banks reestablished a
2-1/4 percent band between their two currencies.
On Monday, August 2, following the announcement of the new
bands, the French franc, the Belgian franc, and the Danish krone
each declined more than 2 percent below the bottom of their previous

bands against the mark. Subsequently, the Belgian franc and the
French franc have stabilized at 1-1/2 and 2-1/2 percent,
respectively, below the bottom of the previous bands, while the
Danish krone has moved down to about 4-1/2 percent below its
previous lower limit. Those three central banks have kept official
interest rates well above German interest rates in an attempt to
regain exchange rate stability, though there has been some easing
relative to the high levels reached at the height of the crisis.
Market participants expect substantial easing of interest rates in
those countries in the near future, as reflected in market interest
rates of three and six month maturities. European stock and bond
markets have rallied on the expectation of interest rate cuts. The
French stock market has risen 7 percent since July 29 and French
bond yields have declined about 35 basis points.
.with no intervention by U.S.
authorities.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Real growth in the major foreign industrial countries was mixed
in the second quarter. Output continued to decline in western
Germany, while in Japan economic activity appears to have stalled
after modest growth in the first quarter. In contrast, British real
GDP continued to grow at a modest pace, and economic activity in
Canada continued to move ahead, although more slowly than in the
first quarter. French output appears to have been flat, or down
slightly, in the second quarter after falling more steeply in the
two previous quarters.
In recent months inflation in foreign industrial countries has
been relatively steady. Inflation in western Germany and Japan has
increased somewhat due to special factors lately, but slack in the

IV-13
Italian and British economies has held inflation down in spite of
sharp depreciations of the lira and pound following their exits from
the ERM last September.
Recent budget developments suggest that fiscal policy is not
likely to provide much additional boost to growth in the medium
term. The Italian government recently presented a new FY1994 budget
incorporating further tightening, and the FY1994 budget recently
approved by the German cabinet is designed to hold the Federal
deficit in Germany at this year's level. Lack of consensus on
economic matters among the members of the new ruling coalition in
Japan is likely to preclude a substantive change in fiscal policy in
the short run. The French government recently proposed some modest
new spending.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, second-quarter data
suggest that on balance economic activity slowed, although there
have been signs of a pick-up toward the end of the quarter.
Industrial production (s.a.) grew 1.3 percent in June after
declining 2.5 percent in April and 2.6 percent in May. New car
registrations (s.a.) rose 8.5 percent in June following a cumulative
20.3 percent slide in April and May, and housing starts (s.a.)
ticked up 3.3 percent after declining 8.2 percent over the same two-
month period. Among less positive signs, the index of leading
indicators fell below the boom/bust demarcation line in May for the
first time in five months, and new machinery orders (s.a.) in the
second quarter were down 9.5 percent from their first-quarter
average. The ratio of job offers to applicants declined from 0.81
in May to 0.74 in June, while the unemployment rate held steady at
2.5 percent.
Consumer prices in the Tokyo area ticked up in July, advancing
1.7 percent on a 12-month basis compared with 0.9 percent in June.

IV-14
The July increase was attributed to higher fresh food prices
resulting from poor weather; excluding perishables, Tokyo consumer
prices rose 1.4 percent on a 12-month basis in July, only slightly
above June's 1.3 percent rate. In part reflecting appreciation of
the yen, wholesale prices continued to decline in June, falling 3.2
percent below their year-earlier level.
The trade surplus (customs basis, s.a.) edged down from $10
billion in May to $8.7 billion in June before rebounding to $11.2
billion in July, bringing the cumulative surplus for the first seven
months of 1993 to $121 billion (a.r.) compared with $107 billion for
1992 as a whole. The June current account surplus (s.a.) declined
to $9 billion from $11.1 billion in May; the cumulative surplus for
the first half of 1993 was $136 billion (a.r.), up from $117 billion
for all of 1992.
A newly formed coalition of opposition parties gained control
of the Diet and on August 6 elected reformist politician Morihiro
Hosokawa, a former LDP member and provincial governor, to be Japan's
new prime minister. Hirohisa Fujii, a former Finance Ministry
official and LDP member of the Diet's Upper House, will serve as
Finance Minister. Because the anti-LDP coalition encompasses
ideological positions ranging from ex-LDP, pro-business
conservatives to the Socialists, it is considered unlikely to
generate the consensus needed to change Japanese economic policy
substantially in the near term.
Major economic indicators in western Germany point to a
continued decline in real GDP in the second quarter following a drop
of almost 6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter. Industrial
production fell 1.8 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter
from an already low first-quarter level. Total orders (s.a.) edged
up slightly in the second quarter from their first-quarter average,

led by an increase in foreign orders. In July, the unemployment
rate (s.a., as a percent of the dependent labor force) rose to 8.3
percent, up from 8.2 percent in June but below the 9.4 percent peak
registered in 1983.
Consumer prices ip western Germany increased 4.3 percent in
July on a year/year basis, reflecting in part the higher value-added
tax introduced at the beginning of January as well as increases in
postal rates and a tax on insurance premiums that took effect in
July. Underlying price pressures have remained moderate. Wholesale
prices dropped 1.8 percent for the year ending in June, while
producer prices declined 0.4 percent over the same period.
Through June, M3 in western and eastern Germany combined
increased 7.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) relative to the fourth quarter of
last year, a pace above Bundesbank's 1993 target range of 4-1/2 to

IV-19
6-1/2 percent. The Bundesbank resumed its policy of gradual easing
in early July when the discount and Lombard rates were reduced to
6-3/4 and 8-1/4 percent, respectively; on July 29, the Lombard rate
was lowered again to 7-3/4 percent. During this period the repo
rate also was cut several times.
The Federal budget for 1994 and medium-term financial plan were
approved by the German cabinet earlier this summer and await passage
by parliament this fall. The budget package would institute a
number of expenditure-reducing measures, the most important of which
is a sizable cut in unemployment benefits and a freeze on nominal
wages of permanent public-sector employees. The Federal budget
deficit would be held to about DM 68 billion in 1994, unchanged from
the expected deficit for 1993. By 1995, the budget package is
anticipated to hold the broad public-sector deficit to about 3
percent of all-German GNP, down from 5-1/2 percent registered in
1992.
In France, real GDP declined 2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter after falling a revised 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter.
Monthly indicators from the second quarter have been relatively
flat. Industrial production (s.a.) rose 0.2 percent in May after
declining 0.6 percent in April, and has recovered somewhat from low
levels registered early in the year. An industry survey by the Bank
of France indicates that industrial production probably was flat in
June. The unemployment rate (s.a.) continued to rise in June,
reaching 11.6 percent. Consumption of manufactured products (equal
to 1/3 of total consumption) rose 0.3 percent (s.a.) in the second
quarter, suggesting that consumption spending stabilized after
falling in the first quarter.

IV-20
Inflation has remained at a relatively low level. The consumer
price index in June was only 2.0 percent above its year-earlier
level, the same as in the previous month.
The French trade balance has continued to record large
surpluses. In April, it registered a surplus (s.a.) of $1.4 billion
after recording a surplus of $2.5 billion in the first quarter.
The government announced that later this year it will privatize
Elf Aquitaine, an oil firm that is France's largest company; Rhone-
Poulenc, a chemical company; and BNP, one of France's largest banks.
In anticipation of the sale, the government issued special bonds
("Balladur bonds") that are convertible into shares of public
enterprises when they are actually privatized. Proceeds from sale
of these bonds will be used to finance a number of additional
measures designed to stimulate growth.
Legislation granting independence to the Bank of France was
approved recently by the French National Assembly and Senate.
However, on August 4, the French constitutional court ruled that
this legislation was not consistent with the clause in the French
constitution giving the government responsibility for economic
policy. The government responded that this setback was not serious
because the necessary amendment to the constitution was contained in
the Maastricht treaty. It stated that it would resubmit the
legislation to the court when the treaty takes effect, probably this
fall.
Provisional estimates suggest that real GDP in the United
Kingdom increased 1.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, the
same rate of increase as occurred in the first quarter. Expanding
manufacturing output appears to have continued to account for much
of GDP growth. Unemployment (s.a.) stabilized at a rate of 10.4
percent in June.

IV-21
In June, consumer prices (n.s.a.) fell 0.1 percent, and the
12-month inflation rate slowed to 1.2 percent. Excluding mortgage
interest rates, consumer prices were 2.8 percent above their level
of June 1992. Cost increases associated with the depreciation of
sterling have been offset by continued moderation in labor costs.
In June, input prices were 7.8 percent higher than a year earlier,
mainly reflecting depreciation of the pound, compared with a decline
of 1.6 percent in June 1992. The underlying rate of inflation in
earnings was 3.8 percent in May, down considerably from 6.3 percent
in May 1992.
The Maastricht Treaty was finally ratified in the United
Kingdom on August 2 after Parliament approved the treaty (with an
opt-out from the Social Chapter) in late July and a court challenge
was dropped after being rejected in the High Court on July 30.
However, Prime Minister Major reiterated that the United Kingdom
would not return to the ERM in the near future, even with the new
wider bands.
In Italy, economic activity remains weak. First-quarter real
GDP fell 0.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) from the fourth quarter, and survey
data suggest that second-quarter industrial production (s.a.)
declined 0.2 percent from the first quarter. The unemployment rate
(n.s.a.) in the second quarter stood at 10.5 percent, up 1.1
percentage point from the rate recorded in the first quarter.
Despite lira depreciation last year and earlier this year,
consumer price inflation has remained restrained due largely to the
weakness in economic activity. In the year to July, consumer price
inflation averaged 4.4 percent (12-month basis), down from the 4.8
percent (Q4/Q4 rate) recorded in 1992.
On July 15, Parliament approved a 12.4 trillion lire (0.8
percent of GDP) supplementary budget reduction package for 1993.

IV-22
The package was needed to prevent Italy's 1993 budget deficit from
mushrooming beyond the target of 150 trillion lire (9.4 percent of
GDP). On July 13, the Ciampi government released its outline for
the 1994 budget that seeks to cut the projected 1994 budget deficit
by 38.5 trillion lire (2.3 percent of GDP).
In Canada, recent indicators are consistent with a moderation
of growth in the second quarter from its strong first-quarter
performance. The average level of industrial production (s.a.) in
April and May edged up 0.3 percent from its first-quarter level.
During the same period GDP at factor cost (s.a.) rose 0.5 percent,
factory shipments (s.a.) increased 0.7 percent, and retail sales
(s.a.) were up 0.8 percent, but new orders (s.a.) dropped 3.3
percent. Relatively high real long-term interest rates may be
contributing to continued weakness in the construction sector;
housing starts (s.a.) rebounded 7 percent in the second quarter but
remained near recession levels.
Slack persists in Canadian labor markets. Total employment
(s.a.) grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter from its first-quarter
average and 0.2 percent more in July, but the unemployment rate
(s.a.) remained above 11 percent. Wage settlements averaged 0.6
percent in the first five months of the year, a record low.
Accordingly, price inflation has remained moderate, despite
depreciation of the Canadian dollar during the past year. The
12-month change in the targeted CPI excluding food and energy was
1.7 percent in June. The all-items CPI was up 1.6 percent over this
period, and wholesale prices rose 2.9 percent.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
There are indications that growth slowed further in the second
quarter in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. In Korea, however, growth
recovered modestly. In China, an economic retrenchment program was

IV-23
instituted in July to help slow an overheated economy. In Taiwan,
the infrastructure investment program is being cut by 22 percent.
Inflation continued to slow in Mexico, falling to single-digit
twelve-month rates in June and July for the first time since 1973,
and in Argentina, where the lowest monthly increase in more than a
decade was reached in July. Inflation remained very high in Brazil,
increased in China, but slowed in Korea. Mexico's trade deficit has
begun to narrow in line with slower GDP growth. Argentina's trade
balance has shifted into deficit, owing mainly to the ongoing real
appreciation of the peso. Brazil's trade surplus widened only
slightly in the first half, despite sharply higher imports following
the easing of monetary policy late last year. Korea's trade deficit
is continuing to narrow, reflecting strong demand from China and
Southeast Asian countries for its exports, while Taiwan's trade
surplus fell in the face of weak world demand. In Russia, bank
notes issued before 1993 have been demonetized.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, business comments and
anecdotal evidence suggest that real GDP growth slowed further in
the second quarter, reflecting tight fiscal and monetary policies
and the inhibiting effect on investment of the growing uncertainty
about the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the
U.S. Congress. As a result, the cumulative trade deficit through
May, at $5.8 billion, was $160 million lower than in the same period
last year, the first time since May 1990 that the cumulative trade
deficit has been less than a year earlier. In January-May, imports
were 7.6 percent higher than a year earlier, while exports were 10.9
percent higher. With large capital inflows from abroad continuing,
international reserves rose further in April, reaching $24.5
billion, excluding gold, $5.6 billion more than at the end of 1992.

IV-24
In June, the CPI was 9.9 percent higher than a year earlier.
This was the first time since 1973 that the twelve-month inflation
rate (as measured by the CPI) was less than 10 percent. In July,
the twelve-month rate of increase fell to 9.7 percent. Interest
rates fell further in July, mainly reflecting lower inflation
expectations and the sluggish pace of economic activity. Further
international reserve gains, only partially sterilized by the Bank
of Mexico, also appear to have been a factor. At the auction of
August 11, the twenty-eight-day Treasury-bill rate was 13.9 percent,
down 186 basis points from the most recent high reached in mid-June.
The peso/dollar exchange rate is continuing to fluctuate in a
narrow range. On August 10, it was 3.1095 pesos per dollar, little
changed from a year earlier, and 5.25 percent above the lower limit
of its band.
In Brazil, judging from anecdotal accounts, economic activity
appears to have slowed over the second quarter. Monthly inflation
was about 30 percent in July and is expected to remain at that level
in August. The 1993 cumulative trade surplus through June was $6.6
billion, only slightly higher than in the same period a year ago.
Exports were 15.8 percent higher, due in part to a large increase in
shipments to Argentina. Imports were 25.2 percent higher, due to
the rapid expansion in internal demand resulting from a loosening of
monetary policies beginning in the fourth quarter of 1992.
In July, foreign commercial bank creditors agreed to reduce
from $3.2 billion to $2.8 billion the amount of collateral that
Brazil is required to provide for the first phase of the Brady-style
rescheduling agreement. This reflects a downward revision from $44
billion to $39 billion in the estimated amount of bank loans to be
restructured. Brazil hopes to secure an IMF agreement, in part to
facilitate conclusion of the rescheduling package, but the continued

IV-25
absence of political support for fiscal and monetary reforms makes
it unlikely that Brazil will qualify for an IMF program by November,
the deadline for implementing the first phase of the rescheduling.
As a result, the future of the package remains in doubt.
In Argentina, manufacturing production is growing more slowly
this year than last year. Automobile production continued to expand
rapidly during the first half of 1993, due to strong domestic demand
and higher exports to Brazil. However, in other manufacturing
industries, output has been dampened by real exchange rate
appreciation and was only 1 percent higher in January-April than a
year earlier. In July, consumer prices rose by 0.3 percent, the
lowest monthly increase in more than a decade, and were 10.7 percent
higher than a year earlier. This compares with an 18.6 percent
increase over the twelve months ending in July 1992.
Merchandise imports during the first five months of 1993 were
8.4 percent higher than a year earlier, while merchandise exports
were 7.1 percent higher. This resulted in a $71 million trade
deficit over this period, compared with a tiny surplus during the
same period last year. International reserves, excluding gold, have
remained steady at around $10 billion during the first half of 1993.
In July, China began concerted efforts to slow its economy, as
signs of overheating continued. In the first half of 1993, GDP was
13.9 percent higher than in the same period in 1992, led by fixed
investment expenditures (including construction). In June, the
urban cost-of-living index was 21.6 percent higher than a year
earlier. This was the largest rise since before the last economic
retrenchment in China, in 1988-89. The new stabilization efforts
began in early July with the naming of Zhu Rongji, China's economics
czar, as head of the central bank. This was followed by measures
principally aimed at slowing credit growth at local levels, where

IV-26
state banks and non-bank financial institutions have channeled much
of their loans to speculative real estate and stock market ventures,
neglecting infrastructure projects. Interest rates were raised for
the second time in two months on July 11, but nominal rates continue
to lag current inflation. In mid-July, a forced sale of Treasury
bonds to urban workers was needed to place the full amount on offer.
.the yuan strengthened
in the Shanghai swap market in late July. It stood at 8.766 yuan
per dollar on August 10, about 20 percent above its July 23 all-time
low. A black market premium on foreign exchange continues to exist.
In Taiwan, real GDP was 6.1 percent higher in the first quarter
than a year earlier, after recording a 6.3 percent increase in the
fourth quarter of 1992 compared with a year earlier. The somewhat
slower growth reflected weaker world demand for Taiwan's exports.
The 1993 cumulative trade surplus through July was $4 billion,
$1.4 billion less than in the same period of 1992. Exports were 5.1
percent higher in value terms, down from a 7.5 percent growth in all
of 1992, while imports were 9.2 percent higher, down from a 14.5
percent rise in all of 1992. The current account surplus fell to
$1.7 billion in the first quarter from $2.4 billion a year earlier.
Price pressures remain moderate. Consumer prices were 3.2
percent higher in July than in July 1992.
The government announced in July that it would cut the size of
Taiwan's ambitious $310 billion infrastructure program by about 22
percent. The program, which was launched in 1991, was scheduled
originally to be completed by mid-1997.
In Korea, real GNP was 4.5 percent higher in the second quarter
than in the same period of 1992. This was a modest recovery from
the low of 2.8 percent recorded in the fourth quarter of 1992,
compared with a year earlier. But it was still less than half the

IV-27
average annual growth rate of the past ten years. Domestic demand
appears to have picked up in response to a lowering of interest
rates in the first quarter and the removal of some restrictions on
construction activity. Strong export growth, mainly to China and
Southeast Asian countries, also contributed to the improved GNP
performance. Exports were 6.6 percent higher in the first half than
in the same period of 1992. This export growth and a 1.5 percent
contraction in imports produced a narrowing of the current account
deficit to $1 billion in the first half from $4.5 billion in the
same period last year. However, a major labor dispute at the
Hyundai Group dampened exports in June and resulted in a nearly $600
million current account deficit for that month.
Consistent with the relatively slow economic activity (by
historical standards), price pressures have continued to ease. The
CPI was 4.3 percent higher in July than a year earlier, after a rise
of 6.6 percent in the twelve months ending in July 1992.
On June 29, the Korean government released a detailed summary
of the third (and final) stage of its blueprint for financial
reform. The "third stage blueprint" contains a comprehensive plan
to deregulate by 1997 virtually all interest rates except on demand
deposits. It also calls for additional liberalization of foreign
exchange market transactions and reduced restrictions on capital
flows, seeks to curtail the use of policy loans, and proposes to
reform substantially the conduct of monetary policy by shifting
toward a primary reliance on such traditional instruments as open
market operations rather than direct credit controls.
Hong Kong's foreign exchange holdings were published in July
for only the second time since a longstanding policy of secrecy was
reversed a year ago. They totaled $35.2 billion at the end of 1992,
up $6 billion from the end of 1991.

IV-28
On July 24, a Saturday, the Central Bank of Russia announced
that all ruble bank notes issued before 1993 were no longer legal
tender effective the following Monday. Individuals were given two
weeks to exchange up to 35,000 rubles in pre-1993 currency (about
$35 at the official exchange rate) for new bills. Amounts in excess
of this amount were to be deposited in six-month saving deposits.
The action, which was announced while President Yeltsin and Finance
Minister Federov were away from Moscow, was criticized from all
sides and, on July 26, President Yeltsin issued a decree that raised
the conversion limit to 100,000 rubles ($100) per person and
extended the conversion period till the end of August.
This action will have little direct impact in Russia because
the 100,000 ruble limit on individual conversions is not expected to
be binding on most Russians. Nonetheless, the currency reform has
undermined the credibility of Russian policymakers.
After the Russian central bank announcement, both Georgia and
Azerbaijan declared that the Russian ruble was no longer legal
tender. However, the ruble had already largely been replaced in
those countries by local substitute currencies. Pre-1993 rubles
will continue to circulate in the seven other former-Soviet-Union
states that are still in the ruble zone until they can be replaced,
probably through the introduction of new national currencies.
