text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial

DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity appears to be expanding at a tepid pace in
the current quarter. An uncertain outlook has discouraged employers
from hiring, especially permanent full-time workers, and households
remain worried about job security. Consumer spending apparently was
up moderately through August, but indicators of housing activity
have not yet given off any clear sign of a homebuilding response to
lower mortgage rates. Shipments of business equipment (excluding
aircraft) rose in July, pointing to further gains in domestic
investment or exports. However, in general, a large share of
domestic demand for consumer goods and machinery seems to be leaking
abroad, and manufacturing output is posting only a mild gain this
quarter. The prices of gold, oil, and some industrial commodities
have been weak of late, while the consumer price index has continued
to post more moderate increases, on average, in July and August.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market data sent mixed signals in August. Nonfarm
payroll employment fell 39,000 in August, after gaining more than
200,000 in July. But the average workweek rose to a relatively
high level of 34.7 hours in August; as a result, hours of production
or nonsupervisory workers moved up further and stood 0.9 percent
(not at an annual rate) above the second-quarter average. The
civilian unemployment rate has moved down over the past two months
and stood at 6.7 percent in August.
Private payroll employment declined 28,000 in August because of
widespread weakness throughout the goods- and service-producing
1. The BLS estimates that the summer jobs program added about
13,000 to local government payrolls in July and added an additional
10.000 in August. The program is estimated to have boosted private
payrolls in July by about 7,000, with no further increase in August.

sectors. Manufacturing lost an additional 42,000 jobs last
month; so far this year, manufacturing employment has fallen nearly
200,000 and currently stands 780.000 below its level at the most
recent cyclical trough. Construction employment also moved lower in
August; nevertheless, construction payrolls have expanded a total of
129,000 so far in 1993. Although employment in services increased
in August, gains were well off the pace of recent months, largely
reflecting more modest increments in health and business services.
Employment also edged up in finance, insurance, and real estate in
August; however, elsewhere in the private service-producing sector,
employment generally moved lower.
Total employment, as measured by the household survey, surged
409.000 in August, following a gain of 82,000 in July.3 Despite
the divergent movements in employment in the household and payroll
surveys in August, household employment so far this year has grown
1.4 million--similar to the gain of 1.2 million recorded in the
payroll survey. The decline in the overall unemployment rate over
the past two months was widespread by demographic groups.
Alternative indicators of labor demand also have been mixed.
The Conference Board's help wanted index rose in July to a level of
100 from 97 in the previous month. Nevertheless, this measure of
labor demand has only been inching up over the past year. Filings
of initial claims for unemployment insurance (including the EUC
adjustment) moved down in early September, and, with the exception
2. Data regarding the effect of Midwest flooding on August
employment growth are limited. The Employment and Training
Administration estimated that only about 13,000 flood-related
initial claims for unemployment insurance had been filed through the
August survey week. In addition, aggregate data from the household
survey indicate that the number of individuals who were unable to
report to work because of bad weather was not unusually large in
August--similar to the results in July.
3. Other data from the household survey, such as involuntary
part-time employment and job losers, generally were little changed
in August.

of the jump induced by GM layoffs during the week ended July 24,
have run between 350,000 to 400,000 since early April of this
year. Claims in this range historically have been consistent
with moderate increases in payroll employment. The Manpower survey
of employer hiring plans for the fourth quarter points to continued
job gains, albeit at a slower rate than earlier in this year: The
survey indicates that hiring in construction, retail trade, and
wholesale trade should exceed seasonal norms in the fourth quarter.
Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers
rose 0.5 percent in August, reflecting, in part, overtime earnings
in manufacturing and a rise in the volatile finance, insurance, and
real estate sector. Over the twelve months ended in August, hourly
earnings increased 2.3 percent, compared with an increase of
2.5 percent over the same period a year ago.
Revised data on labor productivity and costs, based largely on
the revisions to the NIPA, indicate that productivity fell at an
average annual rate of 1-1/2 percent over the first half of 1993--
about 1/2 percentage point less than previously estimated. In
addition, the revised data show that productivity growth over the
most recent recovery and expansion was substantially stronger than
previously estimated; productivity growth in the nonfarm business
sector was revised upward 0.6 percentage point in 1990 and nearly
1 percentage point in both 1991 and in 1992 (table). Since the most
recent business cycle peak in output, productivity is now estimated
to have increased at an average annual rate of 1.5 percent--
substantially above the 1 percent trend that prevailed in the 1980s.
4. Because the civilian unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent in
August--bringing the rate below 7 percent for two consecutive
months--the number of weeks of benefits that new EUC participants
can receive will be reduced from the current level of 20 or 26 weeks
to 10 or 15 weeks beginning on September 12. The EUC program is
scheduled to expire on October 2 (with final payments to be made by
January 15), although talk of extending the program for a fourth
time has surfaced.

We see these data as strengthening the argument that structural and
technological improvements have boosted the noncyclical component of
productivity growth thus far in the 1990s relative to the average
pace of the 1980s business expansion.
Incorporating revised data on wages and employer contributions
for benefits, growth in hourly compensation in the nonfarm business
sector also was revised up noticeably for the past three years,
especially in 1992: Hourly compensation is now reported to have
increased faster than the Employment Cost Index in each of the past
three years. With upward revisions to both productivity and
compensation per hour, estimates of unit labor costs were little
revised, on net.
Industrial Production
IP DATA ARE CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 16 AT 9:15 AM
Overall industrial production rose 0.2 percent in August, after
advancing 1/4 percent, on average, in June and July. Manufacturing
output posted a moderate gain in August, while strikes curtailed
overall output at mines. Utilities generation was unchanged
following large gains earlier in the summer.
Motor vehicle assemblies in August edged a bit below July's
annual rate of 9.6 million units.5 Anecdotal reports suggest
that start-up problems for some new models temporarily held down
August assemblies. Indeed, despite lower assemblies, output of
motor vehicle parts and production of related materials picked up
in August. Inventories of light vehicles are at the low end of the
range that has prevailed since late last year: With production of
autos noticeably lower than in July, inventories returned to
5. The motor vehicle assembly schedules for August reported in
the last Greenbook were overstated by more than one million units at
an annual rate, owing to an error by Wards Automotive Reports.
Actual production fell short even of the corrected schedules.

Outside of the motor vehicle industry, another sharp gain in
computers and related electronic components held up production of
business equipment, and advances in the output of steel boosted
production of durable materials. Output of nondurable consumer
goods was unchanged, and durable consumer goods fell back as the
production of appliances retraced much of the advance posted in
July. Apart from the rise in office and computing equipment,
production of business equipment was sustained after rising quite
rapidly in July. Construction supplies changed little in August,
after bouncing about of late.
With the modest increase in industrial production, overall
capacity utilization remained unchanged in August (chart). Within
manufacturing, the operating rate edged up; utilization for primary
processing industries now is 2-/l percentage points above its
long-run average, as most major industries in this category have
posted sustained improvement over the past year.
The revision to the NIPA brought the cyclical pattern of goods

(chart).6 From the output peak of the recent business cycle
(the second quarter of 1990) to its trough, goods GDP declined
5.4 percent at an annual rate, and industrial production decreased
3.7 percent. In contrast, before the revision, goods GDP was
estimated to have declined at a 7.4 percent rate. Since then, both
goods GDP and IP have increased at close to a 3 percent rate.
Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending appears to be heading toward a healthy
advance this quarter, led by substantial gains in the services
component. Total personal income declined in July owing to flood
losses, but smoothing through this special factor, real disposable
income has continued to advance at a modest pace.
Total nominal retail sales posted a modest 0.2 percent increase
(not at an annual rate) in August, following upward-revised
increases of 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent in June and July,
respectively. Nominal spending in the retail control category,
which excludes sales at auto dealers and building material and
supply stores, was unchanged last month, and the July gain in this
category was revised down 0.3 percentage point to just 0.1 percent.
Despite the recent flatness, real consumer spending for goods
excluding motor vehicles in July and August was well above the level
in the second quarter.
Light vehicle sales in July and August averaged 13.7 million
units--0.4 million units below the strong pace in the second
quarter. This weakness in sales resulted from both a decline in
"fleet" sales and a leveling off in consumer demand. Sales to
consumers (including leased vehicles) of GM and Ford autos were

relatively well maintained this summer, with favorable financing
rates and replacement needs continuing to support demand. Sales
of North American-produced vehicles, which came in at 11.5 million
units in August, perked up to a 12 million unit annual pace in early

Real expenditures on services grew rapidly in July because of
unusually high spending on energy services. Weather data for August
indicate that spending on electricity continued at a fairly high
level. Spending on services excluding energy also has been robust
in recent months. This category grew at roughly a 2-3/4 percent

business equipment spending even though they ultimately reflect
consumer demand for new vehicles.

annual rate between December and July, boosted by particularly rapid
growth in spending on medical care services and brokerage charges.
Nominal personal income fell 0.2 percent, or $9.7 billion, at
an annual rate in July because of weather-related reductions in
proprietors' income and rental income. However, nominal wages
and salaries showed a healthy 0.6 percent advance in July, and the
August employment report is consistent with further sizable gains in
this area. Looking over a longer period, and smoothing through
fluctuations associated with the timing of year-end bonuses, real
disposable income appears to be growing at a modest pace. Between
the third quarter of 1992 and the second quarter of 1993, real
disposable personal income grew approximately 2.6 percent at an
annual rate. Growth in real income still trailed growth in consumer
spending, however, and the personal saving rate declined from
4.9 percent to 4.5 percent over the same period.
The most recent readings of the Michigan and Conference Board
surveys showed that consumer confidence was roughly unchanged in
August. Indicators of consumers' assessments of current conditions
edged down last month, while indicators of expectations of future
conditions rose slightly. During the first six months of 1993, both
the Michigan and Conference Board indexes of consumer sentiment fell
sharply, a move largely reflecting a substantial deterioration in
expectations of future economic conditions.
8. The BEA made two explicit adjustments to July personal income
for the floods in the Midwest and the drought in the Southeast.
First, crop damage was estimated to have reduced farm proprietors'
income by $23.5 billion at an annual rate in July. Second,
uninsured losses of residential and business property lowered rental
income and proprietors' income by $7.2 billion and $4.2 billion (at
annual rates), respectively. The BEA noted, however, that these
estimates are very preliminary and subject to revision as more
information becomes available.

Housing Markets
Housing indicators for mid-summer paint a mixed picture of the
strength of demand and production. Starts were down about 3 percent
in July. Both the single-family and multifamily components posted
small losses. Permit issuance rose, and the level of issuance
indicates slightly more production than does the sample-based
estimate of starts.
Regionally, flooding in the Midwest contributed to a 4 percent
decline in starts; in the West, where starts were off 12 percent,
production is being held down by weak demand in California. During
the first seven months of the year, California posted a 13 percent
decline in permit issuance, relative to a year earlier, even as the
Mountain states were racking up double-digit increases.
Home sales, too, have been mixed (chart). Sales of existing
homes rose for the fourth consecutive month in July and are
approaching the fourteen-year high recorded last December. Sales of
new homes, by contrast, fell in July in all four regions, according
to the preliminary estimate. Transactions prices of homes sold in
July were up 3 percent to 6 percent from a year earlier, depending
on the measure. For the nation as a whole, house prices have shown
some tentative signs of firming in recent months.
Surveys of builders, lenders, and consumers during August and
early September suggest some pickup in housing activity. As
illustrated in the chart, respondents in all three surveys have been
giving more positive readings of market conditions than the level
9. California accounted for 7.6 percent of all residential
permits issued nationwide during the first 7 months of this year
(second to Florida's 10.0 percent). As recently as 1989,
California's share of the U.S. total was 17.8 percent. In the
existing home market, California had 10.3 percent of total U.S.
sales in the first half of this year, nearly double the share of
second place Texas; in 1989. California's share had been
14.5 percent.

these indicators.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment advanced 14.4 percent at an
annual rate in the second quarter but appears to be decelerating
this quarter. On the equipment side, nominal orders and shipments
of nondefense capital goods (excluding aircraft and parts) only
edged up in July, and motor vehicle and aircraft purchases also have
slipped from their rapid second-quarter pace. Investment in
nonresidential structures posted its largest advance in three years
in the second quarter, but construction activity declined in July
and stood 2-1/2 percent (not at an annual rate) below the second-
quarter level.
Sales of motor vehicles boosted capital spending significantly
in the second quarter but have dropped off so far in the third
quarter. Heavy-truck sales dropped 20 percent in July, after
advancing steadily since late 1992. In addition, fleet sales of
automobiles and light trucks tailed off in July and August,
suggesting that business purchases of light vehicles did not repeat
their solid second-quarter gain.
Nominal shipments of computing equipment rose 8.9 percent in
July, after dropping off somewhat in the second quarter. The
healthy growth in real spending on computers over the past year has
been driven in large part by rapid price declines, which likely will
continue in the the current quarter, although at a slightly slower
pace.10 In contrast, the demand for other types of equipment
10. As reported in the August Greenbook, a shortage of Bakelite
epoxy resin, an important semiconductor ingredient, caused a sharp
jump in computer memory prices. The shortage of the resin was the
result of a fire at the Sumitomo chemical plant, which accounted for
up to 60 percent of the world's supply. Sumitomo has since made
arrangements for stopgap production with several other suppliers,
and we now expect shortages of the resin to be of minor importance.

softened in July. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding
aircraft and computers fell 1.6 percent. Contributing to the
decline were reductions in orders for communication and railroad
equipment that reversed large increases in the preceding month.
Elsewhere, the picture was less negative, with metalworking, special
industrial and electrical transmission equipment each showing modest
growth.
Nonresidential private construction put-in-place was off
3.8 percent in July after advancing in the second quarter. Much of
the July decline was the result of softness in the "other
commercial" and hotel and motel categories. Outlays for office,
industrial, and institutional construction were roughly flat.
Smoothing through the extreme monthly volatility of these series,
construction activity has advanced slightly so far in 1993, with
even the devastated office sector showing some signs of bottoming
out.11
According to the Russell-NCREIF index, the decline in prices
for office buildings and other commercial properties has continued.
The national average of nominal appraised values for office
properties fell 17 percent over the year ended in the second
quarter, little different from the decline over the preceding four
quarters. The drop in property values was largest in the West. The
values of both retail and warehouse properties continued to slip,
also due to sharp drops in the West. However, the FDIC's latest
survey of real estate reaches somewhat different conclusions.
Nationwide, 74 percent of the bank examiners and liquidators
11. A few figures indicate the dramatic dimensions of the current
collapse in office building. Coldwell Banker reports that only
2 million square feet of new office space entered the market over
the first half of 1993. In the last "bust" of 1977, 10 million
square feet were built over the first six months of the year. In
the boom years of the 1980s, more than 60 million square feet were
built in a typical six-month period.

responding to the survey believed that prices of commercial real
estate were either steady or increasing at the beginning of the
third quarter: This measure of sentiment has trended up from a low
of 54 percent in early 1992. Weakness in California, where only
53 percent of examiners surveyed believed prices were holding steady
or increasing, held back the national average. Finally, vacancy
rates have moved down about 1 percentage point over the past year,
to a national average of 18 percent.

Elsewhere, natural gas exploration is continuing to pick up in
the current quarter, with footage drilled in July and the rig count
for August both well above their second-quarter levels. Natural gas
producers are optimistic about the demand for gas over the next
decade, as, among other things, the Clean Air Act is inducing
utilities to switch to gas-fired plants.12
Business Inventories
Business inventory investment came to a halt around midyear.
Excluding auto dealers, manufacturing and trade inventories fell at
an annual rate of $6.1 billion in July, after a downward-revised
decline of $0.9 billion in June. The slowing occurred at a time
12. The Utility Data Institute, in its 1993 annual survey,
estimates that natural gas plants will account for more than
40 percent of the additions to generating capacity over the
remainder of the decade. Natural gas plants have lower stack
emissions than coal- or oil-fired units. In addition, the cost of
generating a kilowatt-hour with a gas-fired unit can be up to
30 percent less than with a coal-powered unit.

when growth in shipments and sales was moderate, and non-auto
inventories appear well aligned with market demand.
In manufacturing, inventories were about unchanged in July.
after a small reduction in June. Except for a $4.5 billion buildup
in stocks of electrical and electronic equipment, inventory changes
in most manufacturing industries were relatively small. By stage of
processing, stocks of production materials and supplies rose only
marginally in July, and a $4.9 billion accumulation of finished
goods inventories was about offset by a drawdown in stocks of work-
in-process. Although the manufacturers' inventory-shipments ratio
rose quite a bit in July, the increase was largely due to weak
shipments in aircraft and motor vehicles--two of the more volatile
series in the manufacturing data. Excluding these two industries,
the ratio moved up more moderately. On the whole, no serious
imbalances in manufacturing stocks are apparent at this point.
Inventories were run off in the trade sector in July.
Wholesale inventories were trimmed somewhat in July, following a
$6.2 billion accumulation over the second quarter. Much of the July
decline in wholesale inventories was in the durable goods category,
with an especially large drawdown in stocks held by distributors of
machinery and equipment; nondurable inventories posted a small net
increase. The inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale sector is at
the midpoint of its range in the past 3 years. In retail trade,
auto dealers' inventories fell at $41 billion annual rate in July,
while non-auto inventories declined $2.4 billion. Stocks at GAF
stores were little changed in July, after hefty increases in the
second quarter. GAF stores continued to register healthy sales
gains in July and their inventory-sales ratio fell to 2.35 months--
about the level that prevailed early last winter. Outside of GAF
stores, retailers' inventory changes in July were generally small.

Federal Sector
Federal unified deficit numbers for the first ten months of
fiscal year 1993 have come in at $240 billion, well below the
$271 billion deficit for the comparable period of fiscal year
1992.13 However, excluding deposit insurance, the deficit for the
first ten months of FY93 is nearly identical with the comparable
deficit for the same period of last year.
Reduced outlays for deposit insurance also made the deficit
results better than anticipated by the Administration and CBO at the
time budget estimates were released last spring. In its recently
released Mid-Session Review of the Budget, the Administration
reduced its FY93 deficit estimate from $310 billion to $285 billion.
The CBO's recent update of the budget shows even more improvement
with an estimated FY93 deficit of $266 billion. The CBO forecast
seems more consistent with data for the first ten months of the
fiscal year.
For the fiscal years from 1994 to 1998, the Administration and
CBO forecasts of the deficit are similar. The Administration now
projects the deficit to decline to $180 billion by FY96 and to stay
at that level through FY98, while CBO projects the deficit to
decline to $190 billion by FY96 and to rise slightly thereafter, to
$200 billion by FY98.
Some of the reduction in deficits from the spring forecasts
reflects more favorable economic assumptions, but most of it results
from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93).
Measured relative to a baseline that incorporates the reductions in
defense spending in President Bush's January 1992 budget and holds
the rest of the budget at "current services" levels, the
13. Benchmark revisions show the NIPA deficit over calendar year
1992 to have been $276 billion, about $22 billion lower than
previously estimated. Almost all of the revision comes from
increased receipts, particularly for personal and corporate taxes.

Administration estimates that the package is worth $505 billion over
the next five years, while CBO estimates savings of
$477 billion.14 Much of the difference is explained by the
$16 billion in savings claimed by the Administration from a
shortening of debt maturities; CBO does not see as large an effect
and, in any event, treats such savings as a technical re-estimate
rather than as part of OBRA-93. The Administration also is somewhat
more optimistic than the CBO about the likely revenue gain from the
higher tax rates for upper-income individuals.
Enactment of the thirteen regular appropriation bills that fund
discretionary spending will complete the major legislation that is
required to implement the FY94 budget. To date, the House has
passed eleven of these bills and the Senate five, a pace similar to
that of recent years.
State and Local Government Sector
In the recent revisions to the NIPA, real purchases by state
and local governments were revised up substantially over the 1990s;
indeed, the level of real purchases in the second quarter of 1993 is
now estimated to be $15 billion, or more than 2.5 percent, above the
level reported earlier.15 As a result, the deficit of operating
and capital accounts, excluding social insurance funds, was revised
up, reaching historical highs as a share of GDP (chart): While the
fundamental story regarding the weak budgetary picture for the
sector has not changed, the extent of the fiscal erosion is somewhat
greater. Nevertheless, even though the level of real purchases is
now higher than in recent years, the pattern of a clear slowing in
14. When measured relative to its more traditional baseline, which
assumes compliance with the discretionary spending limits of OBRA-90
through fiscal 1995 and allows discretionary spending to grow at the
same pace as inflation after fiscal 1995, CBO estimates the five-
year savings at $433 billion.
15. The only other major revision in the state and local sector
was to transfer payments, which were revised down, providing only a
small offset to the stronger purchases.

the growth rate of purchases in 1991 and 1992 remains, as states and
localities responded to the deterioration in their finances.
More recently, however, spending by state and local governments
has been strong. In the second quarter, real purchases of goods and
services by state and local governments increased at a 5.0 percent
annual rate. Construction spending accounted for most of this gain,
with increases since March divided between educational facilities
and highways; increases in other purchases were quite modest.
So far, data for the third quarter indicate that activity in
the sector has remained robust. In July, real outlays for
construction stood 5 percent above the second-quarter average; much
of the rise was in building of educational facilities. Employment
of state and local government workers edged off a bit in August, but
the average so far this quarter is 36,000 above the second-quarter
level. Increases in employment in the summer jobs program for youth
as recorded by the BLS were small this summer.
As noted above, many governments have tried to hold the line on
spending in dealing with persistent fiscal difficulties in recent
years. Higher education has been one of the areas most affected.
In contrast, Medicaid spending, spurred in part by federal mandates,
has continued to grow. Indeed, Medicaid spending from state sources
exceeded outlays for higher education for the first time in fiscal
year 1993, which ended in June for most states (chart).
Prices
The recent news on prices has been good. In August, the
overall CPI rose 0.3 percent, following a 0.1 percent increase in
July. Excluding food and energy, the CPI also advanced 0.3 percent
in August, after a 0.1 percent increase in July.
The CPI for food was up 0.3 percent in August, following no
change in July. The prices of fresh fruits and vegetables rose

2-3/4 percent last month, boosted in part by crop losses associated
with the flooding and the drought. Other food prices were little
changed in August.
Energy prices fell 0.5 percent in August after no change in
July. Gasoline prices made the biggest contribution to the decline,
as they decreased another 1.7 percent in August. Pump prices have
fallen nearly 7 percent since February, mainly reflecting an easing
in crude oil costs. In contrast, natural gas prices rose
1.4 percent in August, reflecting the continued passthrough of
higher well-head prices for natural gas to consumers. Although
supplies of natural gas have increased since the spring, they remain
below seasonal norms and this has put upward pressure on prices.
The CPI for commodities other than food and energy rose
0.3 percent in August after virtually no change between April and
July. Although tobacco prices fell 3 percent (see below), the pick-
up in goods prices in August was fairly broad based. Apparel prices
rose almost 1 percent last month, as retailers introduced higher-
priced, fall-winter merchandise a bit earlier than usual. Used car
prices continued to rise at a rapid clip, while new car prices were
up 0.4 percent in August.
The major automakers have now announced prices for their 1994
model-year cars and light trucks. On a comparably equipped basis,
General Motors will be raising prices 1.8 percent, Chrysler plans a
1.2 percent increase, while Ford's prices will edge up only
0.2 percent. Both GM and Chrysler are increasingly moving to a
policy of including many popular options as standard equipment in an
effort to standardize models and reduce costs.16 Among foreign
16. Before adjustment for changes in standard equipment, the GM
price increase is 7 percent and the increase in Chrysler's sticker
prices is 5 percent. Ford has not adopted the "value-pricing"
strategy of its competitors and still is being very aggressive in
pricing the 1994 models: the average sticker price is scheduled to
rise only around 2 percent.

for Japanese imports than for domestic vehicles are not surprising.
given the appreciation of the yen in recent months.
Service price increases were also comparatively modest in July
and August, averaging just 1/4 percent per month for CPI services
other than energy. Owners' equivalent rent rose 0.3 percent in
August after no change in July. Over the twelve months ended in
August, owners' equivalent rent has risen 3.2 percent, compared with
3.5 percent in the preceding twelve-month period. Among other
services, airfares were essentially unchanged in August, after a
2-3/4 percent jump in July. Over the last twelve months, airfares
have risen 22 percent, as some weaker carriers have ceased operation
and the remaining airlines have boosted ticket prices in an attempt
to stem their losses. Medical services prices have decelerated,
rising at a 4-1/4 percent annual rate from May to August, down from
a 7-1/2 percent pace in the first five months of the year.
The latest readings on consumer expectations of inflation over
the next year remain at high levels. In August, the Michigan Survey
reported a mean expectation of inflation of 4.9 percent for the
coming twelve months, up substantially from the year-earlier
reading. The mean expectation from the Michigan survey can be quite
volatile from month to month; but a less volatile measure, the
median expectation, also has moved up from its year-earlier reading,
as has the Conference Board's measure of the mean of expected
inflation. By contrast, expectations of inflation over longer
horizons have been more optimistic recently. The expectation of
inflation over the next ten years, as measured by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional Forecasters,
has trended steadily downward and is currently below 3-1/2 percent.

Producer prices of finished goods fell 0.6 percent in August,
following a drop of 0.2 percent in July. Excluding food and energy,
finished goods prices declined 1.0 percent in August, as prices of
tobacco products plummeted 26 percent;17 excluding tobacco prices
as well as food and energy, the finished goods PPI rose 0.2 percent.
As noted above, the reductions in wholesale cigarette prices began
to appear at the retail level in August, and, if fully passed
through, they would reduce the level of the CPI by about
1/4 percent. The index for intermediate materials excluding food
and energy posted another small increase in August: slack in the
industrial sector continues to restrain price increases in this
area.
The Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials prices
has moved down about 1 percent since the August Greenbook. Prices
of the major industrial metals have been flat or down, consistent
with the recent deceleration in industrial production in the United
States and the ongoing recession abroad. Corn and soybean prices
have moved down since the last Greenbook, partly reversing their
run-up during the Midwestern flood. Precious metals prices have
also reversed part of their recent run-up, and gold prices are down
10 percent since the last Greenbook.
Agricultural Production
In its September crop report, the Department of Agriculture
trimmed its projection of 1993 corn production 3 percent further but
17. The recent round of reductions in prices of tobacco products
began in June, and reflected discounts on a number of "premium"
cigarette brands (in the form of coupon reductions taken at cash
registers). In August, these coupon reductions became a permanent
part of the wholesale price, and the reductions were extended to
other premium brands and to the so-called "discount" brands. In
August, manufacturers raised prices slightly on the lowest tier of
brands--the so-called "sub-generics"--to the level of the discount
brands. However, the sub-generic brands have only very recently
begun to enjoy significant market share, and these price increases
are not likely to affect either the PPI or the CPI.

II-46
left its estimate of soybean production essentially unchanged from
the forecast of a month ago. The projections for cotton, wheat, and
peanuts also were lowered somewhat in the USDA's September report.
Using 1987 prices to value the USDA's projections of physical
output, we now estimate that the constant-dollar value of twelve
major field crops will decline about $5-3/4 billion from 1992 to
1993. This estimated decline is about $3/4 billion larger than the
figure that we obtained using data from the USDA's August crop
report. We think that the BEA will count about half of this
decline--roughly $2-3/4 billion--as the losses from flood and
drought. The remaining portion of the decline in output probably
would have occurred even without flood or drought because of planned
cutbacks in acreage and an anticipated reduction in yields from last
year's exceptionally high levels.

APPENDIX
ANNUAL REVISIONS TO THE NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS
The Bureau of Economic Analysis recently released its annual
revisions to the National Income and Product Accounts for 1990 to 1992,
incorporating new source data and updated seasonal factors. The revisions
raised the growth rate of real GDP in each of the three years, but
especially in 1990 and 1992. Examining the upward revisions by sector,
growth in goods consumption was raised in all three years; upward
revisions were also significant in business fixed investment and state and
local purchases. Real services consumption, the component of spending
that usually has the largest adjustments at the time of the annual
revision, saw only a slight net increase in growth over the three years.
As for prices, the largest revisions were to 1992 when the
increases in both the fixed-weighted price index and the implicit
deflator for GDP were revised up 0.3 percentage point. For both of
these measures, the largest upward revision was to PCE services and
reflected a higher imputation for "services furnished without payment by
financial intermediaries."
The 1990-91 recession is now estimated to have been more
shallow, with real GDP declining a cumulative 1.6 percent rather than
2.2 percent as reported earlier (chart). Also, the expansion since
the trough has been stronger, with output growth having grown at a
2.4 percent annual rate on average, 0.4 percentage point higher than
estimated earlier.
Probably the most interesting facet of this annual revision is
the upward revision to implied productivity growth. Given current
estimates of hours worked, all of the upward revision to real nonfarm
out- put was translated into productivity. The sharpness of the
increase in output per hour in the 1990s relative to the 1.0 percent per
year trend line of the 1980s suggests that more than normal cyclical
forces have been at work and improvements have yielded greater
underlying gains (chart).
Looking at the revisions to the income side of the accounts,
the largest revision was to compensation and resulted from newly
available data on wages and salaries reported through the unemployment
insurance system for 1992. The profit share is now estimated to have
been significantly higher in 1990 and 1991, although it remains
unchanged more recently (chart). The basic trend in the personal saving
rate was unchanged (chart); however, the new data show a large bulge in
the saving rate in the fourth quarter of 1992 and a dip in the first
quarter of 1993. This reflects BEA's estimate that about $20 billion of
year-end bonuses, usually paid in January, were advanced into December.
Overall, the income side was revised up more than the spending
side of the accounts. As a result, the statistical discrepancy, the
difference between the product and income sides of the accounts, is now
smaller than reported earlier. Nevertheless, the discrepancy still
increased by $14 billion in 1992, indicating that income-side measures
of output growth still showed slightly slower growth than product-side
measures.
1. The 1990-91 recession was among the milder of the post-war
recessions; five of the eight post-war recessions were deeper (when
measured in 1987 dollars).

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Since the last FOMC meeting, Treasury bond yields have fallen
sharply further. While the federal funds rate remained at 3
percent, other money market rates edged down as lingering fears of a
near-term System tightening evaporated. With new evidence of a
sluggish economy and modest inflation, and with money market rates
now expected to be stable at low levels for some time to come,
investors have continued to seek higher yields in the capital
markets. The accompanying flattening of the yield curve has been
quite pronounced (chart), although the gap between the long and
short rates remains large by historical standards. Since the August
17 meeting, the yield on thirty-year Treasuries has declined 34
basis points, with about half of this drop accounted for by
revisions to forward rates beyond ten years from now.
Yields on corporate securities and fixed-rate mortgages have
declined slightly less than those on Treasuries over the
intermeeting period, while yields on municipal bonds have lagged a
bit more. Broad equity indexes have risen almost 2 percent, setting
new highs, as lower bond rates and heavy inflows to stock mutual
funds have bolstered demand for shares.
Falling long-term rates have sparked further refinancing among
businesses, households, and state and local governments, but net
borrowing by most nonfinancial sectors probably has been moderate so
far in the current quarter. The monetary aggregates have continued
to be held down by the public's pursuit of higher returns available
on capital market instruments, leaving M2 and M3 around the bottoms
of their target ranges. Bank credit growth slowed sharply last
month, as the boost that had been provided by strong security loan
growth disappeared.

Money and Bank Credit
M2 expanded at a 2 percent rate in August, close to the pace of
recent months. Household savings continued to be diverted to stock
and bond mutual funds, with preliminary data for August indicating
no slackening from the record rate of net share purchases recorded
in July. Led by strong growth in currency and demand deposits. Ml
continued to expand robustly. M2 in August was just above the lower
bound of its 1 to 5 percent annual target range.
M3 edged up in August after two months of declines, as banks
slowed their issuance of nondeposit liabilities outside M3. On a
gross basis, large time deposits continued to run off. However, a
large drop in money fund holdings of bank CDs, which are netted from
the aggregate, caused the large time component of M3 to be flat. M3
remained just below the lower bound of its 0 to 4 percent target
range.
Bank credit slowed in August, to a 3-1/4 percent annual rate,
following three months of fairly rapid expansion. Acquisitions
of securities accounted for nearly all of the rise in bank credit
during the month, as total loans were about flat. Most loan
components slowed, but the weakening was particularly pronounced in
the volatile security loan component, which contracted after
accounting for a significant part of the strength in the three
preceding months.
Business loans were flat in August. Runoffs at large domestic
banks persisted, as firms with ready access to capital markets
continued to tap those markets for new funds and refinancing.
Renewed growth at small banks, however, offset some of the runoff.
Consumer loans in August decelerated from July's double-digit pace,
1. July data had been boosted by a large bank's acquisition of a
primary dealer. The August data represent a deceleration even after
adjusting for the effects of this acquisition.

but still grew at a healthy 7-1/2 percent annual rate;
securitizations had only small effects on growth in July and August.
Real estate loans, which had surged in the second quarter, expanded
more slowly in August. Smaller increases were recorded at domestic
banks, while loans at foreign branches and agencies, whose
portfolios are almost entirely commercial real estate, continued to
contract.
Call report data show that the second-quarter surge in bank
real estate loans was concentrated in 1-4 family mortgages (table).
Home equity loans stagnated, probably because of paydowns with some
of the proceeds from refinanced first mortgages. Rates on home
equity loans, which are often tied to the prime rate or Treasury
bill rates, have fallen relatively little this year, whereas
mortgage rates have declined substantially. The two major
commercial real estate categories, nonfarm nonresidential loans and
construction and land development loans, continued to be weak in the
second quarter.
These data also show further improvements in bank asset quality
through the second quarter. Delinquency rates fell for all three
major loan categories (chart). Charge-offs, net of recoveries,
declined for business and consumer loans and held steady for real
estate loans. Reduced charge-offs were accompanied by lower
provisioning for loan losses, which was an important factor in
strong second-quarter profits. Higher profits, combined with
substantial equity issuance over the quarter, boosted bank capital
further. Indeed, the share of loans held by well-capitalized banks
at the end of the second quarter stood at 70 percent, five
2percentage points above the year-end 1992 figure. With
improving financial health, results from the August Senior Loan
2. These shares reflect any exclusions of banks with CAMEL
ratings of 3, 4, or 5 from the well-capitalized group.

Officer Opinion Survey suggest that banks have reversed some of the
tightening of business loan standards and terms that occurred over
the last few years. The quarterly Survey of the Terms of Bank
Lending indicates that spreads on business loans, however, have
narrowed only marginally and still are wide relative to the late
1930s (chart).

III-10
issuance of junk bonds in August is estimated to have been $5.3
billion, the strongest pace since January's record $6.1 billion.
Moreover, the calendar of upcoming junk issues is crowded. Although
some of the junk bond offerings in August featured original issue
discounts and step-up interest payments, most were straight bonds.
In a somewhat surprising development, issuance of nonfinancial
commercial paper was brisk again in August, as it had been in July.
Part of the strength over these two months, though, owed to large
issues by a foreign government in late July. Some of the additional
strength in commercial paper may be coming from corporations
borrowing short-term while waiting for the bottom in long-term
rates.
August indicators of financing by nonfinancial firms suggest
continued modest amounts of net funds raised, roughly in line with
July's pace. The net flow of business loans and commercial paper
was $1-1/4 billion less in August than in July, while preliminary
estimates of the sum of gross public equity and bond issuance were
$3/4 billion less in August than in July. The lack of data on
retirements and private placements, however, makes it difficult to
judge the net volume of stock and bond issuance.
Pricing of new corporate issues in late August was complicated
by an unusually wide difference in secondary market yields between
the newest and previous thirty-year Treasury issue. The on-the-run
(August) long bond proved particularly attractive in secondary
market trading. With an unusually large premium that may be due in
part to the new, less-frequent auction schedule, this security
currently trades at a yield about 17 basis points below its nearest
neighbor on the yield curve (the May issue). Traders and purchasers
of corporate securities have been unwilling to follow the yield on
the benchmark Treasury security down to that extent. Although

III-11
measured spreads on investment-grade bonds have widened somewhat
because of this anomaly, these spreads have remained tight
throughout the summer, probably because of massive inflows into
corporate bond mutual funds. The heavy recent and scheduled
issuance of junk bonds may have caused some widening in spreads on
these bonds since the August FOMC. Prices of junk bonds have been
supported by sizable inflows to mutual funds this year, but
anecdotal reports suggest that junk bond inflows may have weakened
recently.
Spreads on commercial paper narrowed further in August as
investors scraped for a few extra basis points in yield. Rates paid
by high-rated firms hovered just above those on agency discount
notes, which traded on top of Treasury bills. Moreover, spreads
paid by medium-grade and low-grade issuers fell to near their lowest
levels since records have been kept. As an alternative, investors
reportedly have been buying asset-backed commercial paper to enhance
yield. Despite a top rating, this paper typically trades at a rate
premium because of its complicated structuring and lack of investor
familiarity. As a result of Moody's recent downgrade of IBM's
commercial paper to medium-grade, SEC restrictions will force money
market mutual funds to curtail new purchases of the company's paper.
Like GMAC and Sears before it, IBM likely will run off a significant
amount of its commercial paper, perhaps turning to the asset-backed
securities market for funding.
Major stock price indexes increased about 1 to 2 percent since
the last FOMC. Bank stocks in most regions of the country
outperformed the indexes. Data for August suggested continued
support for prices from strong inflows to stock mutual funds.
Prices of initial public offerings (IPOs) strengthened over August.
Only about half of IPOs, however, have outperformed the Standard &

III-12
Poor's (S&P) 500 stock price index this year. The composite price-
earnings ratio for the S&P 500 now stands at 23, down from the peak,
26, reached in 1992, but still high by historical standards. In
fact, the ratio is about where it was just before the 1987 market
crash, even after adjusting for nonrecurring charges for
restructuring that inflate the ratio by depressing reported
earnings.
The boom in gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms this
year continued through August. Volume for the month is estimated to
have picked up slightly from its July pace, to $5.1 billion. RJR
Nabisco's $1.25 billion perpetual preferred issue dominated the
offerings in August. That issue was the largest preferred deal on
record, surpassing IBM's $1.1 billion issue in June. The market for
initial public offerings also remained robust, with nonfinancial
corporations raising an estimated $1.8 billion in each of July and
August. Moreover, the calendar of proposed IPOs is jammed: About
150 are expected in September alone, a sharp pickup over the
previous three months.
Municipal Securities
With municipal bond rates having declined over the past month
to levels last seen nearly twenty years ago, gross issuance of tax-
exempt bonds continued its recent torrid pace. At $21.3 billion,
August marked the sixth consecutive month in which gross long-term
issuance surpassed $20 billion, a level that before 1993 had only
been exceeded seven times. Last month, offerings to refund
outstanding bonds once again paced issuance and accounted for two-
thirds of the volume. Dealers expect no abatement of refunding
activity in the near term.

The expectation of new supply is the main reason that the ratio
of the index of yields on new issues of thirty-year revenue bonds to
the yield on the thirty-year Treasury bond has risen to its highest
level since late 1989. 3 The ratio of tax-exempt to taxable
yields has increased despite greater demand for municipal securities
arising from the anticipation, and now the reality, of higher
personal income tax rates.
Allegations regarding the use of political contributions by
securities firms to obtain underwriting business in negotiated
offerings have not affected bond yields or issuance. Since such
allegations first came to light last spring in connection with a
refunding by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, several issuers have
moved to competitive offerings. Nonetheless, negotiated sales
3. In late 1989, an increase in the alternative minimum tax on
income from tax-exempt bonds caused property/casualty insurance
companies to curtail sharply purchases of municipal securities.
The use of the yield on the most recently issued thirty-year
Treasury bond also has pushed the ratio up, but this explains only a
small part of the increase in the ratio.

continue to constitute about 80 percent of all bond offerings,
roughly the same percentage as that of recent years.
The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the self-
regulatory organization for brokers and dealers in municipal
securities, has responded to the scandal by proposing a new rule
that would prohibit underwriters from making political contributions
aimed at obtaining or retaining securities business. The rule also
would require underwriters to disclose political contributions made
to officials of states and municipalities awarding business to the
dealer. Concerns have also been raised about the adequacy of
disclosures of financial condition by issuers of municipal securi-
ties, who are exempt from the requirements imposed on corporate
issuers of public securities. Congress is considering a bill that
would remove that exemption. In addition, the MSRB and the SEC are
considering rules for dealers in secondary market transactions, the
effect of which would be to pressure issuers to disclose more
information voluntarily.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The Treasury likely will finance the projected third-quarter
fiscal deficit of $58 billion by borrowing $42 billion from the
public and by drawing down its cash balance by $17 billion. The
marketable borrowing should occur in the coupon sector, where gross
auction sizes are expected to be unchanged to up $500 million. The
Treasury held the gross sizes of the weekly bill auctions at $24.4
billion over much of the quarter, but in recent weeks it trimmed
these auctions to $22.4 billion. These cutbacks should be
temporary, however, as the anticipated sharp increase in fourth-
quarter borrowing could drive weekly bill auctions up to $25
billion.

The August midquarter refunding was an exception to the recent
pattern of small changes in coupon auction sizes. The thirty-year
bond was boosted from $8.25 billion last quarter to $11 billion, as
the Treasury began its scheduled semiannual auctions of long bonds
in August and February.
The House of Representatives has passed legislation that
extends the life of the Resolution Trust Corporation for eighteen
months and provides the agency with an additional $18.3 billion to
complete the cleanup of the saving and loan industry. Earlier, the
Senate approved legislation with similar provisions, but the House
and Senate bills differ significantly over funding for the Saving
Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The House bill authorizes only
$8 billion for SAIF, compared with $16 billion in the Senate bill.
In addition, the House version places strict conditions on the
release of the funds to SAIF, and many analysts feel that these
conditions effectively deny funding to SAIF.
Yields on securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises
declined with yields on Treasuries, maintaining the tight spreads
that have become the norm.
Mortgage Markets
Since the August FOMC meeting, contract rates on conventional
fixed-rate mortgage loans have declined 35 basis points, to
6.82 percent, the lowest level since 1968. With the further decline
in mortgage interest rates, the volume of refinancing has surged
once again. In Freddie Mac's monthly survey of conventional loan
applications at all lenders, the refinancing share, which had
declined in late spring as mortgage interest rates rose, has since
rebounded to a near-record level of 65 percent in August (chart).
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) index of refinancing activity
at mortgage bankers has also hit a new high. The latest survey

III-18
indicates that over 60 percent of applications at mortgage bankers
were for refinancing.
The spread of rates on newly originated mortgages over rates on
comparable Treasury securities has widened a bit in the past few
weeks (chart). Initial rates on ARMs have declined 10 basis points
over the intermeeting period to a series-low 4.33 percent, narrowing
the spread over the one-year Treasury constant maturity yield to
roughly 1 percentage point. Despite low ARM rates, most borrowers
have continued to choose fixed-rate loans. The MBA's weekly survey
shows that ARMs accounted for less than one-quarter of the volume of
all loan applications at mortgage bankers in recent weeks.
Refinancing data from Freddie Mac show that conventional ARMs
accounted for only 5 percent and 27 percent, respectively, of
refinanced FRMs and ARMs in the second quarter of 1993.
Most outstanding mortgage securities are backed by loans with
interest rates that are 1 to 3 percentage points above current no-
points mortgage rates. Consequently, prepayment rates, which had
paused because of higher mortgage rates and fewer applications for
refinancing this past spring, are expected to resume their climb
this fall. Gross issuance of agency pass-through securities
continued at a record pace in July. reaching a seasonally adjusted
$57 billion (table). Pass-through issuance, which generally follows
prepayments with a lag of a month or two, is expected to increase by
year-end. In the mortgage-derivative market, REMIC volume also
remained strong, while heavy demand for principal-only securities
continued to boost issuance of agency-backed, stripped mortgage
securities.
Following a weak first quarter, growth of mortgage debt
outstanding rebounded in the second quarter because of somewhat
stronger activity in housing markets and stronger loan originations

associated with the surge of refinancing earlier in the year. Real
estate loans at banks also grew in the second quarter at their most
rapid pace since 1990. Although growth at banks has fallen off in
the July-August period, the latest spurt in originations of both
refinancing and home purchase loans is expected to lead to somewhat
higher growth of residential mortgage debt in the third quarter.
In. contrast to call report data for banks, the MBA series on
delinquency rates on home mortgages rose somewhat on a seasonally
adjusted basis. The thirty-day "all loan" delinquency rate
increased for the second consecutive quarter, to 4.39 percent, up 10
basis points from the previous quarter but still among the lowest
ratios recorded in more than a decade. The MBA series is based on a
survey of bank and nonbank mortgage servicers and is more heavily
influenced than the call report data by FHA and VA mortgages, whose
delinquency rates rose in the second quarter.1989

Consumer Credit
Interest rates on consumer loans at commercial banks continued
to decline between early May and early August (table). The average
"most common" rate on four-year new car loans was down 19 basis
points since the previous survey in May. Personal loan rates
fell by 18 basis points and were at their lowest point since
November 1990. The average most common rate on bank credit card
plans fell 56 basis points, to 16.59 percent, the lowest level in
the twenty-one-year history of the series. To some extent, the drop
in card rates reflected special promotions. In the latest survey
week, a few banks were running promotions and reported as the most
common rate the very low introductory rates offered on new accounts
or on transfers of existing balances from other issuers.
Presumably, rates at these banks will rise when the usual six-month
promotional periods expire. Some banks reporting lower rates
mentioned competition from other issuers as the reason for the
reductions. It also may be that accounts on which rates were
lowered earlier generated enough activity in August to qualify as
the "most common."
The spread between auto loan rates at banks and the three-year
constant-maturity Treasury rate has narrowed somewhat in the past
two years. In contrast, spreads on both personal loans and credit
card loans remain close to record levels. In particular, the credit
card rate spread, at 12-1/4 percentage points, is only 3/4
percentage point below its record high reached in August 1992.
These high-margin loans remain quite profitable for banks. The 1992

to the Congress, noted that the large "credit card" banks (which
account for 60 percent of total bank-card receivables) improved
their net earnings as a percentage of outstanding balances from 2.57
percent in 1991 to 3.05 percent in 1992. The report noted that this
improvement reflected both a substantial decline in the cost of
funds and an improvement in credit loss experience.
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at an 8 percent
seasonally adjusted annual rate in July, following a downward-
revised 6 percent rate in June (table). The expansion in
installment credit in July was led by strong increases in the
revolving and auto loan components. The "other loans" component--
mainly unsecured personal cash loans--posted a small gain. Total
consumer credit (installment plus noninstallment) expanded at a 6
percent annual rate in July, up from 4-3/4 percent in June.
Consistent with data from the call report, the American Bankers
Association series on delinquency rates on closed-end consumer loans
fell in the second quarter of 1993 (table). The drop continued a
downtrend in this series since the beginning of 1992. Delinquency
rates on all types of loans, except those for property improvement,
declined.

In the first half of 1993, the merchandise trade deficit
widened significantly from levels recorded in 1992, and amounted to
$127.4 billion (SAAR). Exports rose 2 percent in the first half
from year-end levels, while non-oil imports grew 8 percent. The
growth, direction, and composition of U.S. trade flows increasingly
reflect differing rates of economic activity in the United States
and key trading partners, as well as the sources of economic growth.
The expanding economies of Asia (particularly China and the
NIEs) and, to a lesser extent. Latin America (particularly Argentina
IV-1

IV-2
and Mexico) accounted for nearly three-fourths of the increase in
exports from January to June, and more than 90 percent of the
increase in the second quarter alone: these regions accounted for 37
percent of exports for the whole of 1992. Exports to Western Europe
(which accounted for 26 percent of exports in 1992) fell 2 percent
in the first half from their end-1992 levels and dropped 9 percent
between the first and second quarters, as those economies, on
average, continued to stagnate. Exports to Japan remained unchanged
in the first half of 1993 from their year-end 1992 levels. Exports
to Canada grew about 9 percent over that period, but most of the
increase was in autos.
Export growth to Asia was principally transportation goods
(including autos and aircraft), high technology capital goods (such
as telecommunications, computers, and semiconductors), and
industrial and service machinery. Export growth to Latin America
was principally industrial supplies and materials (such as
chemicals), basic investment goods (such as power generating
equipment, and industrial and service machinery), and consumer
nondurables.
In the United States, robust investment activity supported a 9
percent increase (not at an annual rate) in imported capital goods
between the fourth quarter of 1992 and the second quarter of 1993.
while consumer goods imports rose 6 percent reflecting more modest
growth in retail sales. Most of the increase in imported capital
goods came from Japan, Latin America, and Asia. Semiconductors, and
computers, parts and accessories accounted for more than half of the
increase in capital goods imports, while basic investment goods such
as engines, pumps, compressors, parts for power generating
equipment, and some specialized machinery accounted for the rest.

Nearly half of the increase in consumer goods came from China with
an additional 30 percent coming from Canada.
Oil Imports
The value of imported oil increased in June, despite a decline
in oil prices. Preliminary Department of Energy data suggest that
perhaps two-thirds of the increase in the volume of imports was the
result of an increase in consumption. For the second quarter as a
whole, the increase in the volume of imported oil boosted
inventories. Imports may have continued strong in July as stocks
appear to have been built for the fourth consecutive month.

The price of imported oil fell almost $0.70 per barrel from May
to June. Spot oil prices declined almost continuously from late May
through the middle of July, on strong OPEC production (especially
Kuwait and Iran). Import prices should follow this trend with a bit
of a lag. The price of imported oil in August will probably fall to
roughly $15.50 per barrel. Since the middle of July, spot oil
prices have moved in a saw-tooth pattern; declining on increased
prospects of Iraqi exports and bickering between Saudi Arabia and
Iran, and increasing on threats of possible disruptions in Nigerian
and Libyan exports. Currently, the near-term futures contract for
West Texas Intermediate is trading near $16.77 per barrel, about
$2.30 per barrel below its June average of $19.07.

IV-5
Prices of Exports and Non-Oil Imports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports resumed their slight upward
trend in July, rising 0.1 percent. Moderate increases of about 0.3
percent in non-computer consumer durables (such as recreational and
home entertainment equipment) and imported automotive vehicles
reflected in part the rise in the value of the yen, and were only
partially offset by small declines in the prices of consumer
nondurables and industrial supplies (such as paper and chemical
products).
Prices of U.S. agricultural exports increased 5.3 percent in
July, the largest monthly change in over four years. The largest
rises were reported in soybeans and other oilseeds, which were
adversely affected by the Midwest flooding, and wheat and rice.
Nonagricultural export prices declined in July for the first
time since December, with decreases reported in most major trade
categories. The largest declines were in the prices of exported
nonagricultural industrial supplies, especially building materials,
whose price had risen substantially earlier in the year.
U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit in the second quarter of 1993
was $107.7 billion (seasonally-adjusted, annual rate). The $18.5
billion deterioration from the first quarter rate was due to the
worsening of the merchandise trade balance. The surplus in services
trade was virtually unchanged from the first quarter. Net
investment income recorded a small deficit.
The deficit on merchandise trade widened to $137.6 billion in
the second quarter (SAAR) as imports surged. The surplus on
services transactions was little changed at $59.2 billion (SAAR);
increased receipts for travel and passenger fares and license fees

IV-6
and royalties were about offset by increased payments for "other
private services", including financial services.
The balance on investment income showed a small deficit of $1.1
billion, the third deficit quarter in a row. A sharp increase in
payments on foreign direct investment in the United States was
nearly offset by an increase in receipts on foreign direct
investment abroad. Both receipts and payments on portfolio
investments grew modestly.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities accelerated further in
July to reach $18.5 billion (line 2.c of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table). For the first seven months of
the year, net purchases totaled $69 billion, well in excess of the
record annual total for 1992 of $50 billion. The purchases in July
were concentrated in the United Kingdom ($10.5 billion), Canada
($2.7 billion), and France ($1.9 billion). U.S. residents on net
sold almost $1.5 billion in Japanese securities in July. Purchases
in the United Kingdom were primarily Eurobonds, providing little
information about the country of issuance. Purchases of Canadian
securities were also primarily bonds and reflected heavy issuance of
Yankee bonds by the provinces in late June and July. For the first
seven months of the year U.S. net purchases have been fairly evenly
split between bonds and equities. Net purchases have been largest
in the United Kingdom, but there have also been significant
purchases in smaller countries as well. Net purchases in Mexico
totaled almost $4 billion and net purchases in Argentina. Malaysia,
and Israel each totaled about $1 billion. In Japan, U.S. residents
have acquired $1.8 billion in equities and sold $1.4 billion in
bonds during the the first seven months.
Foreigners on net sold $0.6 billion in U.S. stocks in July,
after recording small net purchases in the second quarter (line
2.b). Large sales by Canadian residents more than offset sizable
purchases by Japanese residents. Foreign net purchases of corporate
and agency bonds fell to $1.5 billion in July from nearly $7 billion
in June (line 2.a). June's figure was inflated by extraordinarily
large new Eurobond offerings by U.S. corporations in that month.

IV-10
Foreigners on net purchased $3.6 billion in Treasury securities
in July, after selling $4.7 billion in June (line 3). The swing
between June and July is attributable to much larger purchases by
Canada and much smaller net sales by Japan and offshore financial
centers.
Foreign official reserves in the United States declined
slightly in July (line 4) after posting large inflows in the first
half. Significant declines in German and OPEC reserves were offset
by increases in Mexican and Argentine reserves. Partial data for
August from the FRBNY indicate large increases in Japanese,
Argentine, and Singapore reserves. The increase in Japanese
reserves was associated with exchange market intervention, while the
increase in Argentine reserves reflected proceeds from the sale of a
state-owned oil company.
Net capital inflows through banks and securities dealers
totaled $4.8 billion in July (line 1). Very large inflows through
interbank transactions of foreign-based banks were partly offset by
increased lending by securities dealers to foreigners. Available
data for August indicate further large inflows through interbank
transactions, especially at foreign-based banks. This can be seen
on line l.b of the International Banking Table where the net claims
of U.S. offices of foreign-based banks declined from $-110 billion
in July to $-122 billion in August (on a monthly-average basis).
This inflow was associated with a restructuring of liabilities away
from large time deposits rather than an increase in lending.
Capital outflows through U.S. direct investment abroad picked
up in the second quarter to $10.8 billion (line 6 of the Summary
table). As usual, much of the investment was in Western Europe,
although investment in Latin America, particularly Mexico and

Brazil. was also substantial. For the first half of 1993, U.S.
direct investment abroad totaled $19 billion, similar to the strong
pace in the first half of 1992.
Foreign direct investment in the United States continued strong
in the second quarter at $8.3 billion, bringing the total for the
first half to $17 billion (line 7). Although it represents a
significant increase over the pace of last year, the first-half
inflow is well below the pace set in the late 1980s when annual
inflows averaged about $60 billion.
The statistical discrepancy in the U.S. international
transaction accounts was a positive $14 billion in the second
quarter, up from $9 billion in the first quarter (line 10). The
increase can be attributed in part to larger outflows of currency,
which are not captured in the recorded capital accounts.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average value of the dollar declined 3-3/4 percent
since the August 17 FOMC meeting. A large part of that decline
occurred as a counterpart to the rise of the mark and other European
currencies during the period: the dollar depreciated 6 percent
against the mark and about 6-3/4 percent against the French franc.
Against the yen, however, the dollar rose 4-1/4 percent. The move
down in the weighted average dollar was accompanied by a widening of
about 10 basis points in the U.S.-German long-term interest rate
differential. While the yield on the U.S. ten-year Treasury
security declined nearly 30 basis points during the period to
roughly 5-3/8 percent, the comparable German yield moved down about
20 basis points to a bit more than 6-1/8 percent. Several other

IV-13
European yields moved down similarly. The bellwether bond yield in
Japan declined less than 10 basis points during the period to about
4.15 percent.
Market participants continued to be disappointed by the pace of
easing by the Bundesbank during the period. This disappointment was
most notable on two occasions. The Bundesbank Council decided not
to reduce official interest rates following its August 26 meeting,
prompting an acceleration of the upward pressure on the mark. After
the subsequent Council meeting two weeks later, despite announced
reductions of 50 basis points each in its Lombard and discount rates
to 7-1/4 percent and 6-1/4 percent, respectively, the dollar
declined further. Although the cut in the discount rate increased
the scope for easing, the RP rate was lowered only 10 basis points.
Market participants evidently interpreted this mix of policy
measures as indicating some reluctance on the part of the Bundesbank
to ease market conditions.
On balance over the period since the August FOMC meeting, the
three-month interest rate in Germany was unchanged at about 6-1/2
percent. Comparable interest rates elsewhere in Europe generally
moved down. The three-month rate in France declined 100 basis
points, as French authorities reduced their overnight lending rate
several times during the period and followed the Bundesbank's
official rate reductions with a cut of 225 basis points in the 5-to-
10-day RP rate to 7-3/4 percent. Short-term interest rates also
declined in Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. In Belgium, the
three-month rate rose from near 9-1/2 percent at the beginning of
the period to a high of 13 percent, as Belgian authorities sought.
with only limited success, to keep the Belgian franc close to its
parity with the mark.

Late in the period, however, the pressure on
the franc receded, and the three-month rate moved down sharply to 9-
1/8 percent.
The dollar moved up against the yen early in the period
following joint intervention purchases of dollars against yen on
August 19 by the Desk and the Bank of Japan. The intervention
operations were supported by a statement from Treasury Under
Secretary Summers, in which he indicated concern about the recent
rise of the yen and welcomed the recent decline in the Japanese call
money rate. The market interpreted the intervention and the
statement as a shift in U.S. attitudes and a sign that a U.S.-
Japanese bilateral agreement had been reached that might include
other economic policy actions. The call money rate in Japan
declined about 20 basis points during the period to roughly 2.9
percent until mid-September, when the rate backed up somewhat amid
pressures associated with the end of the reserve maintenance period.
The three-month rate declined nearly 1/4 percentage point during the
intermeeting period to about 2-5/8 percent.
The Desk purchased $165
million against yen during the period, split equally between the
Treasury and System accounts. All of the U.S. intervention was done
in its joint operations with the Bank of Japan on August 19.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Available data for the major foreign industrial countries give
a mixed picture of economic activity in recent months. In Japan
real GDP declined in the second quarter, following a modest first-
quarter increase, and more recent indicators suggest that weakness

IV-16
has persisted. Real GDP in western Germany recorded an increase in
the second quarter, but much of the gain may have resulted from
unintended accumulation of inventories. Output declines in France
and Italy appear to have levelled off in the second quarter. The
United Kingdom's modest recovery appears to have continued in the
third quarter, and Canadian real GDP expanded further in the second
quarter.
Inflation in foreign industrial countries continues to hold
steady. Small increases in the rate of inflation in Japan have been
attributed largely to special factors. There are indications in
western Germany that price pressures in services and housing have
begun to moderate and will lead soon to lower rates of consumer
price inflation.
On balance, fiscal policy has moved toward consolidation as
proposed budgets in Germany. France, and Italy have included
additional tightening. Japan's new ruling coalition has not
introduced any new stimulative measures so far. but an economic
package is expected sometime this month.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, real GDP declined 1.6
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter after rising a revised 2.5
percent in the first quarter. Domestic demand remained virtually
unchanged. A 2.6 percent fall-off in private consumption and a 14
percent drop in private non-residential investment (the largest fall
in almost two decades) were offset by a 21.9 percent increase in
residential investment, a 22.5 percent increase in public
investment, and strong growth in inventories. Real net exports
declined sharply as a 20 percent fall in exports more than offset a

12.6 percent decline in imports. Incoming data suggest that
weakness in activity continued into the third quarter. Industrial
production (s.a.) was about unchanged in July relative to the
second-quarter average. July new machinery orders were down 2.9
percent from their second-quarter average after having declined 9.5
percent from the first quarter. New car registrations (s.a.) also
remained about unchanged in July and August from their second-
quarter average. Retail sales (n.s.a.) declined in July for the
fourteenth consecutive month and fell 5.0 percent below their year-
earlier level. The index of leading indicators, after registering
above the boom/bust demarcation line of 50 for four months, fell to
41.7 in May and 36.4 in June. The ratio of job offers to applicants
(s.a.) declined somewhat further in July to 0.72, while the
unemployment rate (s.a.) held steady at 2.5 percent. In the Bank of
Japan's August economic survey (Tankan), the index of business
sentiment of major manufacturing firms (the percentage having a
favorable view of business conditions minus the percentage with an
unfavorable outlook) dropped to -51 from -49 in the previous survey
taken in May. Firms predicted a 5.9 percent decline in investment
in the fiscal year that began in April, compared with a 4.4 percent
decline predicted in May's survey.

Consumer prices (n.s.a.) in the Tokyo area continued to edge up
in August, rising 2.0 percent on a 12-month basis, up from 1.6
percent in July. The increase was attributable to higher fresh food
prices resulting from poor weather; excluding perishables. Tokyo
consumer prices rose 1.1 percent on a 12-month basis in August,
somewhat below the rate in the first half of 1993. In part
reflecting the appreciation of the yen, wholesale prices (n.s.a.)
continued to decline in August, falling 4.1 percent below their
year-earlier level.
The trade surplus (customs basis, s.a.) moved down to $9
billion in August from $11.2 billion in July, bringing the
cumulative surplus for the first eight months of 1993 to $120
billion at an annual rate, well above the 1992 surplus of $107
billion. The July current account surplus (s.a.) increased to $11.2
billion from $9 billion in June; the cumulative surplus for the
first half of 1993 was $135 billion at an annual rate, up from $117
billion last year.
The protracted slowdown in economic activity, as well as the
recent surge in the value of the yen, have prompted calls for
monetary and fiscal easing. To date. Prime Minister Hosokawa and
Finance Minister Fujii have resisted demands for an income tax cut
and a substantial increase in public spending, citing an erosion of
tax revenues associated with the economic slowdown and the need to
evaluate the effects of the public investment package announced in
April. Instead, on August 19 the government stated its intention to
promote economic deregulation and the passing on of the benefits of
yen appreciation to consumers. On September 10. Prime Minister
Hosokawa called for additional infrastructure spending totalling one
trillion yen (about 0.2 percent of GDP). A detailed package of
economic measures is expected to be unveiled in mid-September.

IV-22
Real GDP in western Germany increased 2.3 percent at an annual
rate in the second quarter (adjusted for seasonal and working day
variation), marking the first quarterly increase in real activity
since the beginning of the recession last year. Net exports rose as
imports declined more than exports. The only other major GDP
component that increased was inventories, which showed rapid
accumulation during the second quarter after significant run-offs
during each of the two previous quarters.

Inventory estimates are derived as a residual between real GDP
(based on production indicators) and its components (based on
expenditure data). One possible interpretation of the second-
quarter increase in inventories is that it reflects measurement
error to some extent. While industrial production was flat in the
second quarter, other evidence (such as the moderation in service-
sector prices and the decline in construction activity) suggests
that the recession has finally reached the service sector. However,
data on production in the service sector are limited, and the
increase in real GDP based on production indicators may overstate
the true increase in real activity. Another possible interpretation
of the second-quarter increase in inventories is that it was

IV-23
unintended. Survey data available through July indicate that since
late last year, firms have regarded inventories as excessively high.
Either interpretation of the second-quarter GDP data suggests that
recovery in western Germany is not yet underway.
Slow growth in western Germany appears to have delayed recovery
in eastern Germany. East German GDP in the first half of this year
was 6.2 percent above its level in the first half of 1992.
considerable below the 10.1 percent figure recorded in the second
half of last year. The smaller rate of increase in the first half
of this year is attributed in part to a sharp deceleration of
capital investment expenditure.
After remaining flat in the second quarter, industrial
production (s.a.) rose 0.5 percent in July. but German officials
expect that revised data for July will show a decline in production.
The volume of new orders for west German manufactured goods (s.a.)
has shown signs of improvement recently, increasing more than 3
percent in July from the second-quarter average. The unemployment
rate (s.a., as a percent of the dependent labor force) rose to 8.4
percent in August, still well below peak rates of more than 9
percent registered during the recession in the early 1980s.
Consumer prices in western Germany increased 4.2 percent in
August on a year/year basis, up from the 4 percent inflation rate
registered in 1992. Inflation has been boosted by an increase in
the value-added tax at the beginning of the year, by an increase in
postal rates, and by a tax on insurance premiums that took effect on
July 1. Wholesale, producer, and import prices (n.s.a.) all have
been declining in recent months from year-ago levels. New data for
May and June show that the the pan-German current account deficit
(n.s.a.) in the first half of 1993 was $9.8 billion, down from the
$11.7 billion deficit recorded in the first half of 1992.

IV-24
The Federal budget for 1994 and the medium-term financial plan
were submitted to the German parliament for approval in early
September, but passage is not expected until later this fall. This
budget holds the Federal deficit to DM 68 billion in 1994 (unchanged
from the expected Federal deficit this year), and it provides for
fiscal consolidation in 1995 and 1996.
In France, recent indicators suggest that economic activity may
have flattened or declined only slightly in the second quarter after
real GDP dropped sharply in the first quarter by a revised 2.8
percent (s.a.a.r.). Industrial production (s.a.) fell 0.4 percent
in the second quarter relative to the first-quarter average. A July
survey by INSEE, the French statistics institute, found that
industrialists expect economic activity to stabilize in the second
half of the year. Consumption of manufactured products (s.a.) rose
0.3 percent in the second quarter, pointing to some recovery in
consumption spending. The unemployment rate (s.a.) continued to
rise in July, reaching 11.7 percent. Capacity utilization (s.a.)
was 80.3 percent in July, slightly below the level of 80.5 percent
recorded in the April survey.
Consumer price inflation (n.s.a.) was unchanged in August at
2.3 percent on a 12-month basis. Inflation has risen slightly from
the level recorded in the second quarter due to increases in excise
taxes on gasoline and alcohol.
France's trade surplus (s.a.) increased to $2 billion in May
from a revised surplus of $1.1 billion in April, as exports rose 6
percent but imports remained essentially flat. The cumulative
surplus for the first five months of 1993 was $5.6 billion (s.a.),
roughly double the surplus registered over the same period last
year.

IV-25
Prime Minister Balladur announced that the 1994 budget would
include a reform of the income tax system resulting in an expected
reduction in income taxes of FF17 billion (about 1/4 percent of
GDP). He also stated that the central government budget deficit
target for 1994 was FF300 billion (about 4-1/4 percent of GDP) down
slightly from the 1993 target of FF317 billion (that is likely to be
overshot). The 1994 target would be achieved by holding expenditure
growth to 1.1 percent in 1994.
Balladur also announced a 5-year plan to combat unemployment.
Some social security charges paid by employers for lower-wage
workers will be transferred to the government, reducing the cost of
employing these workers by roughly 10 percent. The 39-hour work
week is to be replaced with an equivalent annual total to increase
flexibility. In addition, the government will strengthen
apprenticeship programs and provide subsidies to firms for the first
three new workers hired.
Major economic indicators in the United Kingdom suggest that
recovery continued in the third quarter, following a rise in real
GDP of about 2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter. Industrial
production (s.a.) rose 0.7 percent in July from the second-quarter
average. Consumer confidence (s.a.) weakened somewhat in July and
August from its strong second-quarter average, but it has remained
well above the first-quarter level. Average retail sales (s.a.) in
July and August stood 0.6 percent above the second-quarter level.
In August, new car sales (n.s.a.) were 17.8 percent above their
year-earlier level. Business sentiment (s.a.) continued to be
positive in July and August, but was weaker than in the second
quarter on average. The unemployment rate (s.a.) remained unchanged
at 10.4 percent in July.

IV-26
In August, consumer prices (n.s.a.) increased 1.7 percent on a
12-month basis. Excluding mortgage interest rates, consumer prices
were 3.1 percent above their level of August 1992. Cost pressures
associated with depreciation of sterling have begun to ease. In
August, input prices fell for the fifth month in a row and stood 6.2
percent higher than their level a year earlier. In addition, labor
costs continue to moderate. In June, the underlying rate of
inflation in earnings was 3.5 percent, well down from 6.3 percent in
June 1992. In August. MO was 5.2 percent above its level a year
earlier: the increase, the largest in three years, has been
interpreted as indicating further recovery in private consumption.
In the second quarter, the trade balance (s.a.) registered a
deficit of $5.1 billion, little changed from the deficit in the
first quarter.
In Italy, the economy remains weak. Revised data for the first
quarter indicate that real GDP fell 0.2 percent (s.a.a.r.)
reflecting a 12.5 percent drop in domestic demand. Available
indicators suggest that real activity remained flat or declined
slightly further in the second quarter. According to preliminary
data, industrial production (s.a.) declined 1.2 percent in the
second quarter, after stabilizing in the first quarter. The
unemployment rate (n.s.a.), which stood at 13.0 percent in the first
quarter, rose to 13.7 percent in the second quarter; preliminary
estimates suggest that the rate dipped to about 13-1/4 percent in
the third quarter. Surveys conducted in May and June reveal that
more respondents expect production to fall than to rise.
Wholesale and producer prices (n.s.a.) continue to feel the
effects of lira depreciation. In the year to June, wholesale and
producer price inflation averaged 4.9 percent and 3.5 percent,
respectively, on a 12-month basis, up from rates registered in 1992.

IV-27
Weakness of economic activity and aggregate demand has kept
producers from passing on these price increases to consumers. In
the year to August, consumer price inflation (n.s.a.) averaged 4.3
percent, down from the 5.3 percent recorded last year.
On August 26, the government announced a 10 trillion lire ($6.3
billion equivalent) program of public works to combat rising
unemployment. The program had already been approved in the 1993
budget, but funding had been blocked due to ongoing investigations
of corruption. Roughly one third of the money will be spent in
southern Italy to pay for projects already completed. The remainder
will fund new projects in transportation infrastructure. On
September 10, the cabinet approved the 1994 budget that seeks to cut
31 trillion lire (1.9 percent of GDP) from the baseline deficit. If
approved by the Italian parliament, the deficit in 1994 would equal
144 trillion lire (8.4 percent of GDP), down from 151 trillion lire
(9.3 percent of GDP) in 1993.
In Canada, real GDP expanded 3.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
second quarter, about equal to the rate registered in the first
quarter. Business plant and equipment investment grew strongly for
the second consecutive quarter, and residential construction edged
up 1.6 percent (s.a.a.r.), after a sharp drop in the first quarter
of the year. A large increase in inventories also contributed to
growth, the first quarter of inventory building since the end of
1989. Consumption expenditures recorded a moderate increase of 1.9
percent (s.a.a.r.), while export growth slowed somewhat from the
first quarter.
Although real GDP growth in the first half of the year was
considerably stronger than in 1992, growth of final domestic demand
was only moderate, and its rate of increase has remained below that
in periods of recovery in previous cycles. The composite indicator

IV-28
index rose 0.6 percent in July and 0.5 percent in August. The
consumer confidence index for the second quarter fell 12.6 percent
to its lowest level in almost three years, as consumers expressed
continued pessimism over high levels of unemployment and tax
increases announced in several provincial budgets. However, the
business confidence index for the same period increased 2.3 percent.
continuing its upward trend since the fourth quarter of 1991.
Considerable slack persists in Canadian labor markets. Total
employment (s.a.) grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter and rose
0.1 percent further in July and August on average. The increase in
total employment since December 1992 is more than accounted for by
an increase in part-time employment. Nearly 18 percent of
employment is now part-time, a record high, and the percentage of
those working part-time involuntarily has doubled in the past three
years. Wage settlements averaged only 0.4 percent in the second
quarter, a record low.
Low wage increases combined with moderate growth in domestic
demand have helped restrain consumer price inflation, although
depreciation of the Canadian dollar during the past year has raised
industrial prices. The targeted 12-month change in the CPI
excluding food and energy was 1.8 percent in July, already below the
2 percent target set for end-1995.
Prime Minister Kim Campbell has called a general federal
election on October 25. The latest polls still suggest that it will
be a close contest between her Progressive Conservative Party and
the Liberals, who are led by Jean Chretien.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
Mexico experienced its weakest year-on-year GDP growth in
almost five years during the second quarter, while Argentina's
unemployment rate increased to its highest level in a decade. Korea

IV-29
has experienced a slight rebound, and Taiwan's economy has grown at
a moderate pace. In China, authorities have continued to implement
measures to combat overheating, following the initiation of an
economic retrenchment program in early July.
Argentina's consumer price index increased only 9.1 percent in
August from a year earlier, marking its first single-digit inflation
rate in two decades. Inflation also stayed at a single-digit rate
in Mexico, but increased slightly in Brazil. Inflation remained
stable and at modest levels in Korea and Taiwan; however, inflation
has increased slightly in China.
The trade deficits of Mexico and Korea have continued to
narrow because of weak internal demand, while Brazil and Taiwan have
experienced modest declines in their trade surpluses. China's trade
balance has shifted into deficit in 1993 after having posted large
surpluses over the past two years.
Individual country notes. Mexico's real GDP was only 0.3
percent higher in the second quarter of 1993 than in the same period
of 1992. This follows a 2.4 percent rise for the first quarter over
the same period of 1992, and it is the lowest year-over-year
increase since the third quarter of 1988. The deceleration has been
underway since 1990. This year, economic activity has been slowed
not only by the tight fiscal and monetary policies that have been
pursued since early 1992, but also because uncertainty about the
fate of NAFTA in the U.S. Congress has significantly retarded
investment spending.
Slower growth of economic activity has been accompanied by a
reduction in import growth. As a result, Mexico's cumulative trade
deficit for the first half of 1993 decreased to $6.9 billion from
$7.4 billion during the same period of 1992. Exports in the first

IV-30
half were $24.8 billion, up 11.9 percent from a year earlier, and
imports were $31.7 billion, up 7.4 percent from a year earlier.
In August. the CPI was 0.5 percent higher than in July, leaving
it 9.6 percent higher than a year earlier. This compares with a
twelve-month increase of 15.5 percent in the year ending in August
1992. The falling inflation rate has fostered a decline in
inflation expectations, as a result of which interest rates also
have fallen. At the auction of September 14, the twenty-eight-day
Treasury-bill rate was 13.4 percent, 628 basis points less than at
the recent high of March 3, 1993.
In Brazil, anecdotal evidence suggests that second quarter
economic growth slowed somewhat relative to the first quarter. In
the first seven months of 1993, imports were 28 percent higher than
in the same period of 1992, while exports were 12 percent higher.
As a result, the cumulative trade surplus for the year through July
fell to $7.3 billion from a surplus of $8 billion over the same
period a year earlier. Inflationary pressures continued to be
strong. Monthly inflation rose from 30 percent in July to 33-34
percent in August. In mid-August, the central bank began to require
foreign investors to place funds in restricted types of instruments
to reduce capital inflows.
Central Bank President Paulo Ximenes resigned in mid-August
after a series of policy disputes with President Franco. He was
replaced by Pedro Malan, formerly Brazil's foreign debt negotiator.
Although securing an IMF agreement would facilitate the
implementation of the first stage of a Brady-style bank agreement by
the end-November deadline, the absence of progress towards fiscal
and monetary reform makes it unlikely that Brazil will succeed in
doing so by that time.

In Argentina, exchange rate parity between the peso and the
U.S. dollar continues to exert a strong influence on the economy.
The manufacturing sector showed continued signs of weakness, as
industrial production (excluding autos) in the second quarter was
down 0.1 percent from the same period a year earlier. The official
rate of unemployment jumped to 9.9 percent in the second quarter
from 6.6 percent a year earlier. Consumer prices in August were 9.1
percent higher than in August 1992, marking the country's first
single-digit inflation rate in over two decades.
The trade balance shifted to a $162 million deficit during the
first half of 1993, from a $10 million surplus in the same period of
1992, and a $2.4 billion surplus in the same period of 1991. In the
first half of 1993 merchandise exports were 6.9 percent higher than
a year earlier, while merchandise imports were 9.9 percent higher.
In early August, the federal administration and the major
provinces reached an agreement that will eliminate a number of
distortionary provincial taxes (e.g., on financial transactions) and
shift the tax burden further to VAT and payroll taxes collected by
the central government. The government also imposed higher duties
on textile imports in response to allegations of extensive dumping,
and announced a package of tax relief and loans directed toward the
struggling agricultural sector.
In August, Moody's and Standard and Poors assigned initial
credit ratings below investment grade, as expected, to Argentina's
Brady bonds (issued in April 1993) as well as to its other dollar-
denominated government securities.
Industrial production in China grew 23.4 in August from a year
earlier, after increasing 25.1 percent in July and a record 30.2
percent in June. Fixed investment jumped 71.3 percent (in nominal
terms) in July from a year earlier after increasing 73.7 percent in

IV-32
June. inflation has continued to rise. The urban cost-of-living
index rose 23.3 percent in July from a year earlier, compared with a
rise of 21.6 percent in June.
Chinese authorities continued to implement measures to combat
overheating during the past two months. Central to China's current
stabilization effort is a recall of "unauthorized" loans (lending by
China's specialized banks, or their nonbank subsidiaries, directed
toward "speculative" activities such as real estate ventures).
However, since 70 percent of recalled loans are eventually slotted
for other policy lending or to clear inter-enterprise arrears, it is
not clear if the recall will tighten liquidity sufficiently.
Money growth continued to be brisk in the second quarter, with
M2 growing 26.5 percent from the same period a year ago and with
currency in circulation growing 54.1 percent (this latter indicator
is relatively more important in China because of the greater use of
cash in transactions).
After two years of record-setting trade and current account
surpluses, China posted a $4.6 billion merchandise trade deficit for
the first seven months of 1993. U.S.-China trade relations have
become fractious again in the past month. In late August, the
United States placed restrictions on up to $500 million of high
technology exports to China after it found China in violation of the
Missile Technology Control Regime.
Real GNP in Taiwan grew 6.2 percent in the second quarter from
a year earlier, after growing 6.3 percent in the first quarter.
Taiwan's cumulative merchandise trade surplus decreased to $5.2
billion in the year through August from $6.6 billion over the same
period one year earlier, as exports rose 5.0 percent in value and
imports increased by 8.5 percent. A weaker merchandise trade
balance helped to reduce Taiwan's first half current account surplus

IV-33
to $3.1 billion, compared with a $4.2 billion surplus for the same
period in 1992.
Consumer price inflation remained mild in August, with the CPI
up 3.3 percent from a year ago, the same pace as in July.
In Korea, manufacturing output edged up 2.2 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, after growing only 1.4 percent
in the first quarter. Most of the increase in manufacturing output
was attributable to growth in electronics, vehicles, and other heavy
industrial products; output of light industrial products (such as
textiles) was markedly lower during the first two quarters of the
year than in the same period of 1992. Fixed investment has also
remained weak by historical standards, increasing only 0.6 percent
in the second quarter from a year earlier after falling 5.8 percent
in the first quarter. The CPI was 4.4 percent higher in August than
a year earlier.
In the first seven months of 1993 exports grew 7.0 percent and
imports fell 1.4 percent from the corresponding period one year
earlier. This contributed to narrowing the current account deficit
to $1.1 billion over the January-July period from $4.3 billion over
the corresponding period in 1992.
President Kim Young-Sam issued an emergency decree on August 12
that prohibits the use of aliases in financial transactions. The
imposition of property registration requirements for government
officials and anticipation of the "real-name" reform led to a
substantial exodus of funds from financial institutions during July
and August. The government has attempted to mitigate the current
liquidity squeeze by loosening monetary policy since early August.
It has also coupled the reform with regulations that deter moving

IV-34
funds into "speculative activities" such as real estate and that
further restrict overseas capital movement. The stock market has
fallen 6 percent since the announcement of the ban.
In Russia, real GDP is estimated to have fallen 13 percent in
the second quarter of 1993 from a year earlier. However, most of
this decline occurred in the second half of 1992 and output has
roughly stabilized in the several months through July of this year.
Between April and July. monthly industrial production fluctuated
narrowly around two-thirds of its average level for 1990. Russia
registered a trade surplus for the first half of 1993 of an
estimated $9.4 billion, compared with a deficit of $1.3 billion for
the same period last year; exports increased 15 percent, while
imports plunged 49 percent.
Russian monetary indicators have been giving mixed signals
recently. The monthly rate of growth of ruble M2 dropped from 19
percent in May to just 1 percent in June. However, the monthly rate
of growth of central bank credit rose from 8 percent in May to 16
percent in June. Monthly consumer price inflation, which had
averaged about 20 percent from March through July, rose to 29
percent in August. The ruble traded at 1010 rubles per dollar in
the Moscow MICEX auction of September 15. The ruble has been
relatively stable since mid-June at about 1,000 rubles per dollar.
An IMF mission is now in Moscow evaluating Russia's performance
under its Structural Transformation Facility (STF). It remains
unclear whether Russia has made sufficient progress on economic
reform to allow the IMF to disburse the next $1.5 billion tranche of
the STF later this year.
