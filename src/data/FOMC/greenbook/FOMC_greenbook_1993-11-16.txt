RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee
By the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic indicators have generally become more upbeat in recent
weeks. Payrolls posted a solid gain in October, and industrial
output evidently rose sharply. The motor vehicle sector has
strengthened noticeably, with sales and assemblies up smartly. The
latest readings on the housing and business equipment sectors also
have been distinctly positive. Recent wage and price data have been
mixed; notably, however, the increases over the past twelve months
in the PPI and CPI, excluding food and energy, suggest that core
inflation is at the lowest level in three decades.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor input continues to trend up at a moderate pace. After
declining a bit in August, payroll employment rose 162,000 in
September and an additional 177,000 in October. The gains in these
two months were a little above the average monthly rise over the
past year. With an uptick in the length of the workweek augmenting
employment gains, aggregate hours of private production or
nonsupervisory workers rose 0.7 percent in October, to a level
0.4 percent above the third-quarter average. The unemployment rate
was 6.8 percent in October: after holding at about 7 percent during
the first half of the year, it has been at around 6-3/4 percent
since July.
Private payrolls expanded 185,000 in October. A large part of
the gain--84,000--was in business services, mainly the personnel
supply category. Thus far in the expansion, employment in business
services has risen nearly 17 percent, far outpacing cumulative
employment growth of only 2 percent in the private nonfarm economy
as a whole. Further job gains also were reported in October in
wholesale trade and in finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE), a

sector in which a gradual uptrend in employment seems to have taken
hold over the past year. In retail trade, however, employment edged
down in October, after several months of moderate increases.
In the goods-producing sector, construction employment
increased 30,000 in October; the rise was the largest monthly gain
since last spring and seems consistent with other recent indicators
that show a strengthening of building activity. In manufacturing,
employment rose 12,000 in October, after seven months of declines
that had cumulated to a loss of more than 250,000. Small gains were
fairly widespread last month among firms that manufacture consumer
durables and business equipment, but job cuts continued among the
producers of nondurable goods.
The October gain in factory employment notwithstanding, the
current business expansion remains unusual for the degree to which
manufacturers have been able to meet their output objectives through
means other than increased hiring. The number of jobs on
manufacturing payrolls has fallen nearly 800,000, on net, since the
start of the expansion. Rising productivity, in the context of a
slower-than-usual expansion, has been one factor. In addition.
manufacturers have been meeting their labor needs through
lengthening of the workweek, rather than through expanded hiring.
In October, the factory workweek increased an additional 0.1 of an
hour to its highest level since February 1966. Weekly overtime rose
to a historic high of 4.3 hours last month, up a full hour from its
level at the most recent cyclical trough in March of 1991.
In the household survey, employment climbed nearly 475,000 in
October, after dropping 250,000 in September. However, unemployment
also increased, and the civilian unemployment rate moved up a touch,
1. We suspect that to some extent the higher factory productivity
and lower levels of factory employment in recent years represent
greater use of workers supplied by personnel agencies.

to 6.8 percent. Most of the October increase in unemployment
occurred among those on temporary layoff or those who had left their
jobs voluntarily. The number of individuals on permanent layoff
edged down last month, and the number of unemployed entrants into
the labor force was little changed. The labor force participation
rate moved back up to 66.3 percent in October. The rate has
fluctuated between 66 percent and 66-1/2 percent since 1989. Much
of the increased volatility in the participation rate recently has
been concentrated among adult men.
Among other labor market indicators, initial claims for
unemployment insurance, including an adjustment for claims filed
under the EUC program, have been fluctuating around 365,000 in
recent weeks, suggesting a continuation of moderate employment
growth.3 The Conference Board's "help wanted" index declined a
bit in September. As is the case for other labor market indicators,
the index has been on a trend of gradual improvement for more than a
year, but the gains have been slower than those observed during
previous expansions.
2. In an effort to improve the quality of labor force statistics
derived from the household survey, the Census Bureau and the Bureau
of Labor Statistics will introduce, beginning in January 1994, a
redesigned version of the Current Population Survey questionnaire
and adopt computer-assisted interviewing methods. An eighteen-month
overlap sample from-July 1992 to December 1993 has been undertaken
to evaluate the effects of these changes on the monthly labor
statistics produced by the CPS. BLS will not officially report the
results from the overlap survey until next week, but indications are
that the new survey will raise the level of the unemployment rate by
1/4 to 1/2 percentage point.
3. The EUC program was closed to new initial claimants on
October 2. Individuals who have exhausted their regular benefits
may draw EUC benefits for seven weeks if their state's unemployment
rate is below 9 percent. If the rate is above 9 percent,
participants receive thirteen weeks of benefits. A new extension of
the program that is still pending in the Congress would no longer
allow individuals the option of filing for regular or EUC benefits.
If the extension is approved, the EUC adjustment to the initial
claims data will no longer be necessary.

Industrial Production
Growth in industrial output remained slow through September,
but activity appears to have accelerated in October. The September
rise of 0.2 percent was led by gains in motor vehicles, business
equipment, and construction supplies. However, output at utilities,
which was boosted by the summer heat wave, fell sharply in September
as temperatures dropped back to more normal seasonal levels. For
the third quarter as a whole, manufacturing output grew at a
41.4 percent annual rate; excluding motor vehicles and parts.
factory output rose at a 2.8 annual percent rate. The capacity
utilization rate for total industry held steady again in September.
at 81.6 percent.
Industrial production apparently increased substantially in
October. Motor vehicle production bounced back further, and other
available weekly output data, such as coal shipments and electricity
generation, also moved up last month. Production worker hours in
manufacturing rose 0.2 percent in October (FRB seasonals),
reflecting the increases in employment and the factory workweek; the
gain in motor vehicles accounted for about half the rise in
production worker hours.
Motor vehicle assemblies were up about 8 percent in October.
Increases were posted for both autos and light trucks. November and
December assembly schedules suggest further strength in production
in those months, even after allowing for some potential underbuild.
The increase in production of motor vehicles in October was
accompanied by an even sharper rebound in sales; consequently, the
4. In the national income and product accounts, goods GDP grew
5 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter; growth in this
category from the third quarter of last year to the the third
quarter of this year was about 4-3/4 percent, compared with a gain
in manufacturing IP of about 4-1/2 percent. These movements
continue the pattern of growth in goods GDP being much more volatile
than growth in manufacturing on a quarter-to-quarter basis; over
time, however, both measures have grown at about the same rate.

Personal Income and Consumption
Despite continuing weakness in income growth and consumer
sentiment, consumption has shown increased strength of late; the
overall gain for the third quarter was 4.2 percent at an annual
rate. In September, strength was evident in spending for goods
other than motor vehicles--assuming, of course, that the advance
report on retail sales was an accurate reading. The only spending
data available for the fourth quarter show a surge in sales of cars
and light trucks in October: sales of these vehicles had declined in
the third quarter.
Both the third-quarter decline in sales of light vehicles and
the October surge were shaped partly by supply constraints that
developed over the summer but that have eased more recently. These
supply constraints appear to have led to a flattening of consumer
purchases and to absolute declines in daily rental company sales for
Ford and GM in the third quarter (the latest available fleet data).
Industry sources indicate that consumer purchases (including leases)
accounted for a large portion of the October increase in car sales.
With regard to light truck sales, problems in the BEA seasonal
factors likely resulted in an understatement of sales for September
and an overstatement for October.5  Smoothing through the monthly
data, the 5.2 million unit average pace of sales in September and
October matches the strong second-quarter pace.
Other auto-market indicators remain positive. Although the
Michigan index for consumer attitudes toward buying conditions for
5. Sales contests between Ford and Chevrolet in September and
December 1991 caused a boost in those two months, with paybacks in
the following month. In our view, the BEA seasonal adjustment
procedure does not adequately account for these sales as "unusual
events," and thus the BEA seasonal factors expect too many light
truck sales in September and December and too few sales in October
and January.

cars edged down in October, the index is 10 percent above year-ago
levels. Another indicator, showroom traffic, strengthened in
October. More fundamentally, low finance rates continue to support
demand. In addition, firms continue to provide novel financing
schemes--such as credit card rebates and other subsidies--to
increase the affordability of their vehicles.
Real spending for durable goods other than motor vehicles rose
about 1 percent in September and increased 15 percent at an annual
rate in the third quarter. Especially large increases continued to
be reported for consumer electronics, a reflection, in part, of
ongoing price declines for personal computers. Further strong gains
for furniture and major household appliances were likely related to
the pickup in housing sales and starts. Outside the durable goods
category, spending on services increased 3.7 percent at an annual
rate in the third quarter, boosted, in part, by weather-related
energy expenditures. Spending on nondurable goods grew at a rate of
3.4 percent in real terms.
Real disposable income rose only 1.1 percent at an annual rate
in the third quarter. Special factors, most notably the Midwest
floods and the Southeast drought, worked to depress growth, but even
excluding these effects the rate of growth of real disposable income
was only 2.2 percent. Real income growth from the third quarter
of 1992 to the third quarter of 1993 was also 2.2 percent, a
slowdown of about 3/4 percentage point from the gain of the previous
year. However, growth in labor income at least appears to be off to
a good start in the current quarter, as a consequence of the October
6. Farm proprietors' income was reduced in July, August, and
September to reflect crop damage. Rental income was reduced in July
to reflect uninsured losses to nonfarm residential property, and
nonfarm proprietors' income was reduced in July to reflect uninsured
losses to business property. In total, these effects reduced
nominal disposable income in the third quarter by $12.8 billion at
an annual rate.

employment gain and the accompanying uptick in average hourly
earnings (discussed later).
Surveys of consumer sentiment indicate that the strength in
third-quarter spending did not coincide with any improvement in
consumers' underlying attitudes. Both the Michigan and the
Conference Board sentiment indexes remained flat over the course of
the summer, and the two surveys gave conflicting signals in
September and October. Unemployment expectations, which econometric
evidence suggests may be more highly correlated with consumption
growth than are the overall sentiment indexes, appear from both
surveys to have deteriorated recently.
The third-quarter surge in consumer spending, coupled with
modest income growth, resulted in a decline in the personal saving
rate to 3.7 percent from 4.4 percent in the second quarter; the
saving rate has averaged about 4 percent over the first three
quarters of 1993, down more than a percentage point from the 1992
average. The low saving rate observed so far this year does not
appear to be the result of a surge in household wealth. Although
stock markets have performed relatively well over the past year, the
increases in asset values have not been large enough to explain much
of the recent increase in spending. Furthermore, econometric
estimates of the effects of wealth on the saving rate typically find
that such effects occur quite gradually, with a mean lag of around
two years--too slowly to explain the sharp drop in the saving rate
this year. Another possibility, of course, is that errors could be
present in the reported saving rate for recent quarters, as
7. The unemployment expectations indexes are constructed as the
fraction of respondents who expect unemployment to increase minus
the fraction who expect it to decline. The time period of the
expectations is the next year for the Michigan survey and the next
six months for the Conference Board survey.

historical revisions often have resulted in sizable upward
adjustments (chart).8
Housing Markets
Housing activity strengthened in the third quarter. Starts
rose 5-1/4 percent, reflecting increases in single-family and
multifamily housing production, and permit issuance increased nearly
10 percent, corroborating the strengthening observed in starts.
Sales of new and existing homes moved up further in the third
quarter and were especially strong in September.
Starts of single-family homes in August and September were at
their highest levels in almost five years. The increase in starts
is consistent with indications of expanding demand for single-family
homes; sales of new homes rose sharply in September and were at the
highest level since late 1986, and sales of existing homes increased
to the second-highest level in fourteen years.
Several other housing market indicators suggest that the market
for single-family homes has continued to strengthen into the fourth
quarter (chart). Bolstered by low mortgage rates, consumer
attitudes regarding homebuying conditions improved further in
October--the Michigan Survey Research Center series on those
attitudes, which dates back to 1968. was at the highest level on
record. Similarly, the index of builders' ratings of new home sales
in October equaled the high for that series. The index of
applications filed at mortgage bankers for loans to purchase a new
or existing home has remained in an elevated range in recent weeks.
8. The BLS has reported that preliminary tabulations from
unemployment insurance tax records for the first quarter of 1993
suggest that in June 1994 the March 1993 level of payroll employment
will be revised up by 250,000; on a monthly basis, upward changes to
employment growth likely will be wedged back into the second half of
1992. In estimating income for 1992, the BEA used wage and salary
data from U.I. tax records through December 1992, which were, in
part, already consistent with higher levels of employment. However.
the potential remains large for revisions to the income data from
more complete information on nonwage sources of income.

In the multifamily sector, starts moved up in September to
210,000 units (annual rate), one of the best readings since late
1990 for this depressed sector. However, part of the increase
likely reflected the signing in early August of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93), which reinstated and made
permanent the tax credit for low-income rental housing that had
expired in mid-1992. According to the National Association of Home
Builders, housing development agencies in some states quickly
allocated these tax credits, contributing to the surge in starts.
Because of a requirement that at least 10 percent of the subsidized
investment in new housing be made by the end of the calendar year in
which the tax credit is granted, other states are likely to allocate
tax credits to builders in coming months, thus providing some
additional impetus to multifamily starts.
Apart from the effect of the tax credit, scattered signs of
improvement in the multifamily market have been evident in some
local markets in recent months, judging from the anecdotal reports
of rising rents and increased multifamily construction activity. In
addition, the national vacancy rate fell in the third quarter; it
remains at a high level, however, and real residential rent (CPI
measure) has continued to fall, suggesting that conditions are not
yet conducive to a widespread strengthening of unsubsidized
multifamily construction.
Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for business fixed investment increased at an
annual rate of 6-1/4 percent in the third quarter, considerably less
than their first-half pace. Spending for producers' durable
equipment was up 9 percent last quarter, about half the rate of
increase posted earlier this year; equipment outlays were held down
by declines in the aircraft and motor vehicle components, but

spending for computing equipment and for other capital goods (for
example, communications and industrial equipment) scored large
gains. Outlays for nonresidential structures, which turned up
during the first half of this year. dropped back a bit in the third
quarter.
The influence of the "accelerator effect" on investment has
waned, as growth of business output has leveled off since earlier in
the cyclical expansion. However, two other key determinants have
been more favorable of late. Cash flow has recorded strong gains in
the current expansion and, after decelerating late last year and
early this year, appears to have picked up recently. In addition,
the cost of capital has continued to drop, reflecting ongoing
reductions in computer prices, lower interest rates, and increases
in equity prices.
With regard to equipment spending, business purchases of motor
vehicles, which bounded up during the first half of this year. fell
back in the third quarter. Part of the decline apparently stemmed
from the supply disruption at General Motors. As noted previously,
businesses, especially rental companies, apparently bore the brunt
of the production shortfall for light vehicles over the summer
months; however, fleet sales apparently improved a bit in
October.10 Sales of heavy trucks were about unchanged last
quarter but have increased substantially since mid-1991; according
to industry sources, domestic producers are bumping up against
9. The September report on shipments of durable goods, which was
not incorporated into BEA's advance GDP estimate, suggests a small
upward revision (a bit less than $1 billion in 1987 dollars) to
third-quarter PDE. In addition, we received the September report on
construction put-in-place after the advance GDP estimate. For the
third quarter as a whole, these data were just a bit stronger than
BEA had assumed and suggest an upward revision to outlays for
nonresidential structures of about $1/2 billion.
10. Actual growth in PDE for motor vehicles is likely to be
overstated in the third quarter because leases by consumers are
included in PDE.

capacity, a factor that will likely constrain further increases in
production and sales, at least in the near term.
Domestic aircraft purchases dropped about $2 billion (1987
dollars) last quarter to a level at the low end of the range seen
during the past couple of years. These outlays have bounced around
a lot during the past year but have not shown a clear downtrend;
according to industry contacts, a sharp decline is expected during
the next year or two.
Elsewhere, spending for computing equipment surged more than
50 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter. These outlays
have been trending up at a 33 percent annual rate since the early
part of 1991 and have accounted for close to two-thirds of the gain
in total equipment outlays during this period. The computing sector
has been boosted by waves of innovations in both hardware and
software. Ongoing price wars among manufacturers also have boosted
sales. A number of new products recently have been introduced, for
example, machines based on Intel's Pentium processor, Digital
Equipment's Alpha chip, and the line of Power PCs from the IBM-
Apple-Motorola alliance. These machines are just starting to roll
off the assembly lines, and trade sources report that manufacturers
expect to ship large volumes next year.
Real outlays for other types of capital goods, for example,
communications equipment and industrial equipment, have been
trending up at about a 6-1/2 percent rate during the past year.
Spending in the current quarter should gain support from recent
increases in new orders for nondefense capital goods other than
aircraft and computers; those orders rose 3 percent (not at an
annual rate) in the third quarter.
After declining in 1991 and 1992, outlays for nonresidential
structures appear to have turned the corner this year. Cross-

currents still are present, however. In the office sector, vacancy
rates have come down only slightly during the past year or two, and
price declines for office space have not moderated. Nonetheless,
permits for new office buildings have flattened out, albeit at a
very low level, suggesting that this sector may be close to
bottoming out. Industrial construction, which includes warehouse
space, also has been trending down, consistent with high vacancy
rates in this sector and declining property values.

Note: Changes are from second quarter to second quarter.
Other components of the nonresidential structures sector have
been trending up. Institutional construction has been driven by
gains in hospitals (mainly for additions and modernization) and
nursing homes, which have more than offset weakness in educational
structures. "Other commercial" construction, which includes retail
stores, has been rising for about a year, and recent data on
contracts suggest that this trend will continue. Prices for retail
stores still are declining, according to the National Real Estate
Index, but at a much slower rate than previously. In addition, the
utilities sector has flattened out this year after a strong increase
in 1992. Outlays in the drilling and mining sector have been
boosted by increased exploration for natural gas.

came in well to the low side of assumptions that BEA had built into
its estimate. A sizable downward revision to the third quarter
inventory estimate thus appears likely, unless non-auto retail
stocks--for which data will be released early next week--posted a
large increase.
In current-cost terms, the September drop in manufacturers'
inventories amounted to $13.5 billion at an annual rate and followed
a string of modest changes from June to August. Many key industries
that reported large stock drawdowns in September--notably, primary
metals, machinery, and motor vehicles--also experienced sizable
increases in shipments that month. Inventory-shipment ratios thus
fell further in those sectors.
In the trade sector, wholesale inventory accumulation slowed in
September, after a substantial rise in August; even so, the ratio of
inventories to sales in this sector has remained flat for several
months. Among durable goods, the rate of inventory accumulation
picked up, led by increases in motor vehicles, electrical goods,
machinery, and miscellaneous durables. However, inventories of
nondurables were trimmed in September, owing primarily to a drawdown
in stocks of farm products. Outside of automotive products, data on
retail inventories are only available through August. As of that
date, nonauto stocks had changed only slightly, on net, over several
months, and the inventory-sales ratio for the sector had been
virtually unchanged since early spring.
Federal Sector
Declines in federal purchases continue to be a source of
restraint on the economy. Real defense purchases fell at an annual
rate of 8.3 percent in the third quarter, after a slight uptick in
the second quarter. Nondefense purchases, excluding CCC purchases,
were flat in the latest quarter.

The unified budget deficit for August and September, the last
two months of the fiscal year, dropped to $15 billion in FY1993 from
$19 billion in FY1992. Although outlays in those two months were
nearly 5 percent above the level of a year earlier, the rise was
more than offset by an increase in receipts.
For FY1993 as a whole, the deficit was $255 billion, about
$35 billion less than in FY1992. A drop in deposit insurance
outlays accounted for nearly all the decrease in the deficit. The
FY93 deficit was $30 billion lower than the Administration had
projected in September when it released the Mid-Session Review of
the Budget; about one-third of the error was due to an underestimate
of receipts, and about two-thirds was due to an overestimate of
outlays, particularly those for Medicare and Medicaid. The FY1993
deficit was also lower than the Congressional Budget Office's
September projection of $266 billion.
Receipts in FY1993 were 6 percent higher than in FY1992, about
the same as the increase in nominal GDP. Corporate tax receipts
rose 17 percent in FY1993, reflecting strong growth in the corporate
tax base and, more than likely, an increase in the effective
corporate tax rate. (The actual effective corporate tax rate will
not be known until third-quarter corporate profits are reported by
BEA.) A smaller rise, of about 5 percent, was posted for personal
income and social insurance taxes.
Outlays in FY1993, excluding deposit insurance, were
4.2 percent higher than in FY1992. Spending for Medicare and other
health programs was up markedly again last year, growing more than
10 percent, but this rise was only about half the rate of increase
posted in FY1992. Elsewhere, outlays were boosted by sharp
increases in the price support portion of agricultural spending and
in the financial assistance portion of educational spending. Net

and outlays for national defense fell about 4 percent in nominal
terms.
Turning to recent legislation, the Administration recently
submitted to Congress its proposal for health care reform and its
"October package" of budget savings measures. The Administration
now predicts that its health care proposals will result in
$58 billion of deficit reduction from FY1995 through FY2000. down
$33 billion from earlier estimates. The "October package" of
savings measures consists primarily of proposals made in Vice
President Gore's National Performance Review report. The package is
projected to yield $15 billion in savings over five years if acted
on this year. In continuing legislative activity, eleven of the
thirteen regular appropriation bills for the FY1994 budget have been
signed, and two are awaiting final passage. The appropriations
bills are expected to comply with the OBRA caps, but a final tally
will not be known until all the bills are passed. Finally, both the
Senate and the House have passed bills extending eligibility for
federal emergency unemployment benefits, which had expired
October 2; however, the bill's future remains in doubt because a
means-testing amendment in the Senate bill has been strongly opposed
in the House.
State and Local Government Sector
BEA's advance estimate of third-quarter GDP showed real
purchases of goods and services by state and local governments
increasing at a 2.1 percent annual rate, well below the pace of last
spring but about in line with the average rate of growth over the
past year. Small increases were apparent in several categories.
Real spending on construction was little changed in the third
quarter, but data for September, which became available since the

II-38
NIPA release, suggest that the figure will be revised up by around
$3 billion. In October, employment of state and local workers fell
10,000, following a large advance in September; these movements
appear to reflect seasonal adjustment problems related to
educational workers.
On the receipts side, state and local revenues from income
taxes and federal aid rose only a little in the quarter. As a
result, according to staff estimates, the deficit of operating and
capital accounts, excluding social insurance funds, widened a bit
further, to more than $60 billion at an annual rate.
The combined account of the state and local sector--i.e.,
including social insurance funds--has been hovering around the zero
mark in recent quarters. By comparison, this measure of fiscal
balance had been in surplus by an average of around $45 billion per
year during the expansion of the 1980s. The deterioration reflects
not only a worsening in the operating and capital accounts since the
mid-1980s but also a leveling out in recent years of the surplus
flowing into the state and local social insurance funds.1 The
flattening out of these surpluses has resulted primarily from a
slowing in interest and dividend earnings, especially in 1990 and
1991. and from continued steady growth in benefit payouts. At the
same time, growth in the governments' contributions to these funds
has slowed owing partly to concern about retaining funds for
operating accounts.
11. Retirement systems constitute approximately 90 percent of all
the social funds, which in some states also include workers'
compensation and temporary disability insurance. As of the middle
of 1993, public employee retirement systems alone controlled nearly
$1 trillion in assets, roughly one-third of all pension assets.
Inflows to the social insurance systems accrue from contributions by
employers and employees as well as from interest earnings and
dividends. Offsetting the revenues are transfer payments to
retirees and other annuitants.

II-39
Prices
The recent price reports hint at a continued trend of gradual
disinflation, with favorable monthly readings on core inflation
persisting into early autumn. The overall CPI was unchanged in
September but jumped 0.4 percent in October, when the new gas tax
was implemented. Over the past twelve months, consumer prices have
increased 2.7 percent--down from 3.2 percent during the year-earlier
period.
Food prices at the retail level increased little in September
but food jumped sharply in October. The CPI for fresh fruit rose
considerably in October for the fourth month in a row, and price
increases picked up in a number of other categories as well.
Despite the October jump, the twelve-month change in the CPI for
food has remained on the low side of the trend in core inflation, in
part because of a very favorable trend in labor costs in the food
sector: The twelve-month change in the ECI for hourly compensation
at retail food stores has decelerated a full percentage point over
the past year, and in the third quarter, that ECI measure actually
edged down a bit. Nonetheless, with further deterioration of farm
crop conditions reported by the USDA in both October and November--
and corn prices on the rise once again--the risk of acceleration in
the trend of food price inflation still appears to be present.
Energy prices rose nearly 2 percent in October, mainly
reflecting the influence of the 4.3 cents per gallon gasoline tax
that took effect on the first of the month. Private survey data
indicate weakness in gasoline prices in early November despite
environmental regulations that require the use of oxygenated fuel
(to reduce carbon monoxide emissions) in some areas after
November 1.

Excluding food and energy, the CPI moved up 0.3 percent in
October, after a 0.1 percent increase in September. For the twelve
months ending in October, the CPI excluding food and energy rose
3.0 percent--a half percentage point below its year-earlier pace.
Apart from a brief period in mid-1983, the last time the twelve-
month change in the CPI excluding food and energy was as low as
3 percent was the first half of 1973.12 In the PPI. the twelve-
month rate of change in the index for finished goods other than food
and energy was 0.1 percent in October, the lowest reading in the
history of the series (which goes back to 1973).
Among nonfood, non-energy goods, consumer prices have increased
only 1.6 percent in the past year, down from 2.7 percent for the
previous twelve-month period. Tobacco prices have declined
dramatically over the past year, owing to pass-through of the
25 percent price cut implemented by the major cigarette makers in
August. In addition, apparel prices have increased only 0.6 percent
over the past year; stable import prices have no doubt been an
important factor, as much apparel is purchased from abroad. The CPI
for new motor vehicles rose 0.2 percent in October, to a level
3.3 percent above that of a year earlier. New model year cars and
trucks began to be incorporated into the CPI in October, and phase-
in of the prices of those new models will continue for several
months.
Unlike goods prices, service prices have shown only slight
deceleration over the past year. Airline fares have increased about
15 percent in the past year, with the surviving carriers boosting
ticket prices to stem their losses. Rent of shelter has increased
at about the same rate in the past twelve months as in the previous
12. The official CPI excluding food and energy was held down in
1983 by sharp declines in mortgage interest rates and no doubt
understates the underlying rate of retail price inflation in that
year.

year. The twelve-month change in prices of medical care services
has decelerated by a full percentage point in the past year,
although it still is running double the core rate of inflation. One
"service" that has fallen in price is auto financing, as interest
rates have come down further in the past year.
Recent reports on consumers' expectations of inflation have
been mixed. The Michigan survey for October showed average
expectations of inflation for the next twelve months declining to
4.0 percent, from the 4.8 percent reading of September. However,
the latest reading from the Conference Board survey showed average
expectations moving up from 4.4 to 4.9 percent. Neither survey
provides a reason to think that expectations of inflation have been
much affected by the recent stretch of favorable news on actual
price developments.
A slowing of inflation in producer prices still is evident in
the recent data. The PPI for finished goods rose 0.2 percent in
September, but then fell by the same amount in October; its level in
October was only fractionally above that of a year earlier.
Excluding food and energy, the PPI was pulled down in October by
sharp declines in the (seasonally adjusted and quality-adjusted)
prices of cars and trucks. The index for passenger cars was up
1.9 percent from a year earlier: excluding the quality adjustments,
the rise in car prices was about twice that large. The October PPI
for light trucks was about 4-3/4 percent higher than a year-ago;
over the summer, the twelve-month change in truck prices had been
running in the 6 percent to 7 percent range.13 The prices of
intermediate materials excluding food and energy were unchanged
again in October. They have been essentially flat over the past six
months, after a moderate run-up in the first few months of the year.
13. In contrast to its treatment for cars, BLS does not publish
its calculation of quality changes for light trucks.

Scattered upward pressures have emerged in the commodity
markets in recent weeks, with the prices of steel scrap and lumber
up particularly sharply. The jump in steel prices seems to reflect
the recent pickup in orders for steel mill products, much of which
may be coming from the motor vehicle sector, while the rise in
lumber prices probably is related in large part to the recent
strength in homebuilding. In other industrial markets, commodity
price changes have been mixed in recent weeks--zinc and tin prices
have firmed a bit since September, while copper and aluminum prices
have fallen further, on net. Continued pressure from Russian
exports still appears to be an important influence on aluminum
prices. Precious metals prices have rebounded since the end of
September, reversing a portion of their third-quarter declines.
Farm commodity prices weakened into mid-October but have
strengthened appreciably since then. Of the various commodity
indexes, the CRB futures index, which gives heavy weight to
agricultural products, has been showing the most strength since mid-
September. The metals portion of the Journal of Commerce index has
also moved up since the last Greenbook. but the broader index of
commodity prices has declined somewhat.
Labor Productivity and Costs
Recent data indicate that the trend in labor compensation
increases has remained essentially flat. As measured by the
employment cost index (ECI), hourly compensation increased
3.4 percent at an annual rate over the June to September period,
about the same as the rise over the previous three months. Over the
twelve months ended in September, ECI hourly compensation increased
3.7 percent--slightly more than the rise during the previous year.
Breakdowns of the ECI data by industry and occupation generally
show only small changes in compensation trends in recent quarters.

Among the exceptions, the ECI for workers in finance, insurance, and
real estate jumped in the third quarter, owing largely to a pickup
of compensation gains in the real estate business. By contrast,
steady deceleration continued to be evident in health services, a
sector in which the twelve-month rate of compensation change has
fallen by about a percentage point over the past year.
According to the breakdown of ECI data by workers' bargaining
status, compensation has continued to rise more rapidly in the union
sector than in the nonunion sector this past year.14 However, the
difference between the two rates of increase is narrowing, with the
compensation of nonunion workers picking up slightly and the gains
of unionized workers continuing to slow. Wages and salaries in the
union sector rose less than 3 percent over the past year.
Further evidence of an easing of wage pressures in the union
sector was contained in the most recent quarterly report on major
collective bargaining agreements. In the major contracts ratified
in the third quarter, wage adjustments (excluding lump-sum payments
and COLAs) in the first-year and annually over the life. of the
contract averaged only 1 percent and 1.6 percent respectively.15
When these same parties negotiated two or three years ago, their
wage adjustments averaged 3.6 percent in the first year and
2.9 percent annually over the life of the contract. The effective
wage change for all workers covered by major settlements increased
2.6 percent over the latest year, down from 3.2 percent in the
14. Workers at a given establishment are classified as unionized
in the ECI if a majority of the workers in their occupation at
that establishment are covered by binding collective bargaining
agreements.
15. These data cover collective bargaining units with 1,000 or
more workers in private industry. The 430,000 workers who ratified
contracts in the third quarter represent about 29 percent of the
1.5 million workers under covered settlements reached during the
twelve months ended in September.

previous year; this result, which takes account of COLA adjustments
as well as current and previous wage settlements, is similar to the
slowing of union wages reported in the ECI.
The agreement between the United Auto Workers (UAW) union and
Ford was included in the third-quarter data on major settlements and
covered about 100,000 workers, or about one-quarter of workers who
ratified major agreements last quarter. Since then, an agreement
between the UAW and Chrysler has been ratified and a tentative
settlement has been reached with GM. The Chrysler and GM contracts
followed the pattern set by the UAW-Ford contract: Wages increase
3 percent in the first year followed by lump-sum payments of
2-1/2 or 3 percent in the second and third years--Ford and Chrysler
workers get a $600 Christmas bonus each year of the contract. The
new agreements maintain the COLA that essentially passes about
80 percent of increases in the CPI-W into wages. In addition, the
automakers will continue to pay the full cost of union members'
health insurance. The contracts also retain provisions related to
income protection, which provide workers laid off due to a plant
closing 95 percent of their regular earnings for up to two years.
The average monthly pension benefit will be increased about
13 percent over the life of the contract.16
16. In other provisions of the new agreements, auto makers will
be able to hire new workers at 75 percent of the standard wage
rather than the current 85 percent rate. In addition, new workers
will more slowly move to parity with more senior employees. This
clause benefits Ford, which is poised to expand employment over the
term of the new contract. However, it is of little benefit to GM,
which is seeking to cut its work force about 65,000 within the next
few years and reportedly has a $2,000 per car cost disadvantage with
Ford. GM had sought changes in the pattern agreement that would
have allowed it to achieve substantial reductions in its labor
costs; although the company was unsuccessful in obtaining major
changes, it did achieve some minor ones. Namely, laid-off workers
will now have to transfer to a job within 75 miles (rather than 50
miles) or accept lower supplemental unemployment benefits. Also,
union members will have to use one week of their vacation time
during the company's annual two week shutdown for model changeovers.
On the downside for GM are the pension enhancements in the new
settlement--these are expected to boost GM's unfunded pension
liability significantly.

Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector jumped nearly
4 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, reflecting a
4.1 percent increase in output and a 0.2 percent increase in hours.
Output per hour had fallen in both the first and second quarters of
this year, after surging in the second half of last year. Over the
four quarters ended in 1993:Q3, labor productivity rose almost
1-1/2 percent.
Nonfarm hourly compensation rose 3.5 percent in the third
quarter, and the four-quarter change was 3.2 percent. In contrast
with ECI hourly compensation, nonfarm compensation has decelerated
more than 2 percentage points over the past year. The two measures
of compensation growth diverged considerably in 1992 when the ECI
increased 3.5 percent and nonfarm compensation rose 5.2 percent.
However, more recently, nonfarm compensation has moved more closely
in line with the ECI. Of course, the two series have diverged
considerably before--and the recent discrepancy is not outside the
range of historical experience.
With the past year's rise in hourly compensation partly offset
by the growth of labor productivity, unit labor costs in the nonfarm
business sector increased only 1.8 percent over the four quarters
ended in 1993:Q3, the same as the rise during the previous year.
Pressures on prices thus have been damped.
The benefits of rising productivity also are mirrored in the
recent trends in real hourly compensation--measured by the
difference between the rise in nominal hourly compensation and the
rise in the price of business output (chart). Real hourly
compensation increased at an annual rate of 1.6 percent from 1990 to
1993, virtually the same as the rise in nonfarm labor productivity
over that same period and well above the average rate of rise for
the 1980s.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Bond markets have been volatile in recent weeks in response to
data first suggesting subdued inflationary pressures and then
stronger economic activity. The constant-maturity thirty-year
Treasury yield reached a record low of 5.78 percent on October 15,
but subsequently rose and is unchanged on balance since the
September FOMC meeting. Other Treasury coupon rates have risen
15 to 25 basis points. Private long-term rates have generally moved
up with Treasury rates.
Although federal funds have continued to trade near 3 percent,
other short-term interest rates have increased over the intermeeting
period. Rates on Treasury bills have risen 15 to 20 basis points as
the federal government covers its sizable fourth-quarter deficit
mainly through bill sales. In addition, yields on private three-
month instruments rose as maturities moved beyond the turn of the
year; current pricing suggests that borrowers are willing to pay a 6
or 7 percentage point premium at year-end to secure funding over
that three-day weekend.
Major stock price indexes have posted net gains of from 1
percent to 5 percent since the last FOMC meeting. Growth stocks led
the markets early in the intermeeting period, whereas cyclical
stocks showed strength more recently as the economic outlook
improved. Since the beginning of November, however, most indexes
have generally moved down, reflecting the increase in market
interest rates.
Businesses, households, and state and local governments have
continued to take advantage of reduced long-term interest rates by
refinancing existing debt, although the backup in rates after mid-
October appears to have slowed this activity somewhat. The broad

monetary aggregates and bank credit were held down in October by the
spinoff of a large bank's trading unit into a subsidiary.
Underlying monetary growth remained lackluster as well, however, as
flows to stock and bond mutual funds continued at a substantial
pace. Bank credit remained fundamentally weak, even though consumer
loans and, to a lesser extent, real estate loans have shown some
strength.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 stalled in October after advancing in September at the
fastest rate since May. Growth was depressed last month by a
slowdown in M1 growth and by a contraction in the nontransactions
component, as NationsBank spun off its primary dealer into a section
20 subsidiary, removing the dealer's RPs from M2 and M3.1 Even
abstracting from this temporary factor, however, the underlying
trend in M2 remained sluggish, damped by continued runoffs in small
time and savings deposits. Thus far this year, M2 has grown at a
1-1/2 percent annual rate, placing the aggregate a bit above the
lower bound of its target cone.
The continuing weakness in M2 likely reflects the efforts of
retail investors to stretch for yield, as inflows to bond and stock
funds, though dipping a bit, remained large in September, and they
reportedly picked up again in October. The slowdown in September
was most pronounced for bond funds, as inflows to tax-exempt funds
fell to half their rapid year-to-date pace and high-yield corporate
bond funds experienced a temporary outflow.
M3 growth weakened in October, reflecting the slowing in M2.
The non-M2 component picked up, however, boosted by substantial
inflows to institution-only money funds and an increase in large
1. Since NationsBank purchased the dealer in July, these
transactions have no net impact on monetary growth for the year as a
whole.

time deposits. Since the fourth quarter of last year, M3 has grown
at a 1/2 percent annual rate, placing the aggregate a bit above the
lower bound of its growth cone.
Bank credit was flat in October.2  Like the broad monetary
aggregates, it was affected by the NationsBank reconfiguration.
which depressed securities holdings and security loans. Adjusting
for this event, bank credit grew at an annual rate of 3-1/2 percent
in October, about the same rate as in the previous two months.
Business loans were about unchanged, after declining in September.
as increases at small banks offset runoffs at large banks and
foreign agencies and branches. Total real estate loan growth picked
up to a 4-3/4 percent annual rate in October. Consumer loans
accelerated sharply, extending the robust growth in this category
that began in the first quarter.
With only a couple of medium-sized banks following Morgan
Guaranty's unexpected 50 basis point prime rate cut, the spread
between the prevailing prime rate and the federal funds rate remains
at an elevated level. The stickiness of the prime rate has been
partially offset by some accommodations by banks in pricing prime-
based loans, but has also resulted in reduced demand for such loans.
Although rate spreads on small loans remain large, the average
spread over prime on all prime-based loans has been on a downward
course since 1989, declining nearly 90 basis points on balance
(chart). The share of gross extensions of floating-rate loans
priced off the prime rate has fallen about a third, from 75 percent
in 1988 to just over 50 percent this year. This decline likely
reflects the ability of many large and middle-market borrowers to
opt for lower-cost credit by selecting their base rate and spread
from a menu offered by the lender.

More generally, the high prime rate appears to be masking an
increased willingness of banks to make commercial and industrial
loans. Senior Loan Officer Surveys since May have shown that many
banks have eased terms on business loans and that some have eased
lending standards as well. Preliminary data from the most recent
survey, taken earlier this month, show a continuation of this trend.
The fraction of respondents reporting easier loan terms increased a
bit from the August survey: nearly half the respondents reported
that fees and spreads on credit lines provided to large and middle-
market customers had declined over the past three months, and nearly
a quarter of them indicated that these costs had fallen for small
borrowers. Standards for approving commercial and industrial loans
were eased by 10 percent to 20 percent of the respondents, with more
banks reporting easing standards for larger customers.3  These
survey results are consistent with recent press reports that banks
are pricing loans more aggressively. Despite recent evidence of
easing, however, banks still appear to be lending somewhat
cautiously compared with the late 1980s.
Business Finance
Other sources of short- and intermediate-term business credit
have been mixed in recent months. Finance company business loans
expanded at a 5-1/2 percent pace--the highest this year--in
September, the most recent month for which data are available.
Growth would have been higher still but for a large decline in
wholesale automobile loans, as lower inventories reduced dealers'
financing needs. In contrast, nonfinancial commercial paper
outstanding, which grew rapidly during the summer, slowed in
September and declined in October. The premium for year-end funds
is currently about 600 basis points in the commercial paper market,
3. A full analysis of the Bank Lending Practices Survey is
included in a Greenbook supplement.

III-10
while the quality spread on A2/P2 paper, at about 17 basis points.
remains near its historical low.
Gross issuance of stocks and bonds by nonfinancial corporations
in October was substantial, suggesting that firms continued to take
advantage of favorable financing costs in long-term markets to pay
down short-term debt. Partial data for early November suggest that
stock and bond issuance remains strong in spite of the recent backup
in interest rates. In October, gross public issuance of equity was
more than $5 billion, down only a bit from September's rapid pace.
The volume of initial public offerings totaled $1.6 billion in
September and continued at a robust pace in October. Gross bond
offerings picked up in October, reaching almost $17 billion, after
moderating during September. Junk bond issuance slowed sharply in
September, apparently in response to increased yield spreads, but
rebounded in October. Market participants report that inflows to
junk bond funds resumed over the past few weeks, leading to a
narrowing of spreads and the pickup in issuance.
The pace of merger activity has increased this year. In
contrast to the 1980s, however, nearly all the recent mergers could
be characterized as "strategic" in nature, that is, aimed at
increasing market power in an industry or at entering an industry
with business synergies. For example, both Bell Atlantic's friendly
takeover of TCI and the battle between Viacom and QVC for Paramount
fit this pattern. With the exception of the bidding for Paramount,
large mergers have generally been completed using stock swaps rather
than cash payments--a sharp contrast to the cash deals that
predominated in the 1980s.
Quality spreads measured relative to the thirty-year Treasury
bond have widened somewhat over the intermeeting period as the
premium commanded by the on-the-run thirty-year bond relative to the

III-ll
previous issue increased 5 to 10 basis points, to almost one-quarter
percentage point, since the last FOMC meeting. Indeed, market
participants report that the on-the-run bond has become relied upon
less as a benchmark for pricing long-term corporate issues.
For the first time in five years, Moody's reported more
upgrades than downgrades of U.S. firms last quarter. The broad
industrial pattern of the rating changes, however, was little
changed from recent quarters. Downgrades continued to outnumber
upgrades for nonfinancial firms, with computer companies--including
IBM, Apple. Tandy. Hewlett-Packard, and Tandem--taking the brunt of
the negative actions. In addition, both Moody's and Standard &
Poor's recently increased their assessments of the business risk
facing more than forty large electric utilities; principal factors
cited by the rating agencies were expectations of increased
competition as the industry is deregulated and generally slow growth
in demand. Financial institutions continued to show substantial
improvement, with nineteen firms receiving upgrades, including
several money center and large regional banks.
Major stock indexes rose over the intermeeting period, with
most touching record highs in mid-October. Growth stocks showed
large gains in late September and early October but cooled off late
in the month. In contrast, stocks of cyclical firms--especially
those in consumer-oriented industries--were weak early in the
intermeeting period but picked up at the end of October on strong
earnings reports and data suggesting more robust economic growth.
As a consequence, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved to a record
high in early November before backing off with the jump in bond
yields. In contrast, bank stocks declined over the intermeeting
period, despite strong growth in reported earnings and substantial
positive earnings surprises at some money center and regional banks.

III-12
Utility stocks fell sharply after the ratings agencies announced a
weaker outlook for the industry.
Municipal Securities
Gross issuance of long-term, tax-exempt securities slowed a bit
in October, to $19.5 billion, down from more than $21 billion in
August and September. Although the volume last month was the third
lowest this year, it was high by historical standards and brought
the total for 1993 to $226 billion, topping the record $216 billion
in 1992. Refunding volume weakened slightly in October and dropped
off appreciably in early November, as the backup in long-term rates
caused some issuers to postpone offerings.

p Preliminary.
During the third quarter, Standard & Poor's upgraded more local
issuers' credit ratings than it downgraded, marking the first time
since the fourth quarter of 1992 that upgrades outpaced downgrades.
Over the first three quarters of the year, downgrades exceeded
upgrades by about one quarter, roughly the same margin as in 1992,

III-13
but a large improvement over the roughly four-to-one ratio of
downgrades to upgrades posted in 1991. No states experienced a
rating change during the third quarter.
Local government finance in California continued to suffer from
that state's economic troubles. Moody's lowered the rating on the
City of Los Angeles, citing the prospect for continued weakness in
the city's economy resulting from the depressed real estate market
and the loss of defense industry jobs. Moody's also placed all of
California's county governments under review for possible downgrade,
reflecting a lowering of property tax revenues, offset only in part
by increased sales taxes. Moody's views the higher volatility of
sales tax revenues as a distinct negative.
In contrast, the rating on Massachusetts's general obligation
debt was raised from A to A+ in October by Standard & Poor's; the
agency based the upgrade on the strengthening of the state's economy
as well as its adoption of a conservative budget for 1994. This is
the second upgrade the state has received from Standard & Poor's
since September 1992, when its debt was the lowest rated of all
states (a distinction now held by Louisiana).
In the aftermath of numerous allegations and several federal
investigations of political influence peddling, seventeen of the
largest municipal bond underwriters have voluntarily agreed to curb
political contributions to state and local officials representing
governmental units with which the underwriters have business
relationships. The SEC is encouraging bond lawyers, regional
underwriters, and other market participants to join the voluntary
ban.4
4. In addition, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
proposed a rule in late August that would ban business-related
contributions by underwriters.

Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that the Treasury will finance the
projected $94 billion fourth-quarter fiscal deficit by borrowing $88
billion from the public and reducing its cash balance. With the
seven-year note dropped from the auction cycle and with no long-term
bond scheduled for the upcoming midquarter refunding, the Treasury
will rely on bills for two-thirds of its funds this quarter. Since
the beginning of the quarter, the Treasury has increased the gross
size of the weekly bill auctions from $23.6 billion to $27.6
billion. It also auctioned two cash management bills totaling $24
billion to help bridge upcoming seasonal financing needs. At the
November midquarter refunding, the Treasury increased the size of
the three- and ten-year note issues by $500 million and $1 billion,
respectively, and chose to reopen the on-the-run ten-year note,
which had been "on special" in the RP market and trading at an 8
basis point premium to the yield curve.
In the agency market, spreads remain on the narrow side,
despite brisk issuance that included a modest increase in callable
debt. Heavy third-quarter issuance by Fannie Mae and Feddie Mac
reflected, in part, the increase in their mortgage investment
portfolios. These investments have been funded with a mixture of
short-term securities and long-term callable securities. This
funding mix allows the agencies to securitize these mortgages rather
than hold them on their books if funding costs change.
Mortgage Markets
Responding to the recent sell-off in the Treasury market.
interest rates on conventional thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages
have risen sharply. The spread of thirty-year conventional
mortgages over the ten-year Treasury note is little changed on
balance since the September meeting. Secondary market yield spreads

on newly originated conventional loans remain about 10 basis points
wider than in late summer, owing in part to unexpectedly high
prepayment rates and increased uncertainty about future prepayments
(chart)--both of which have been affected by the now wide
availability of "no-point" mortgage loans. Rates on adjustable-rate
mortgages declined 14 basis points over the intermeeting period to
4.17 percent, another record low.
The Mortgage Bankers Association's indexes of mortgage
applications to purchase and to refinance homes remain in record
territory, although the latest survey data may not fully reflect the
effects of the recent jump in mortgage rates (chart). While the
refinancing index has declined from its record level at the time of
the last FOMC meeting, refinancing applications still account for
about 60 percent of the volume of mortgage originations. Actual
mortgage prepayment rate experience suggests that, barring further
declines in mortgage rates, refinancing applications will subside
as the remaining stock of high-rate loans that have not been
refinanced falls.
Data from Freddie Mac on refinancing transactions for which
Freddie Mac both owned the original loan and purchased the new loan
show that borrowers are choosing to refinance with longer-maturity
mortgages. In the third quarter, 47 percent of thirty-year
borrowers who refinanced selected shorter maturity loans, down from
about 59 percent in 1992 (chart). The share of thirty-year loans
being refinanced with twenty-year loans--which was negligible a year
ago--grew to 7 percent last quarter. In contrast, the proportion
choosing fifteen-year loans has declined from more than 40 percent
in 1992 to near 30 percent this year. This shift toward longer-
maturity loans may be, in part, the result of the flattening of the
Treasury yield curve since late last year.

Analysis of refinancing transactions by Fannie Mae indicates
that, with the shift toward longer maturities, the average monthly
mortgage payment for homeowners refinancing all types of fixed- and
adjustable-rate mortgages fell about 2 percent in the third quarter.
This decline contrasts with refinancings in 1991 and 1992 when
average monthly mortgage payments of households that refinanced
actually increased owing to higher amortization payments and to
shifts from adjustable-rate to fixed-rate mortgages.
Growth of mortgage credit appears to have strengthened a bit
recently from its sluggish first half pace. Net issuance of agency
pass-through securities bounced back from near zero in the second
quarter to above $25 billion in the third (chart). In addition,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac added $13 billion to their combined
mortgage investment portfolios in the third quarter, likely, in
part, to smooth out the high level of pass-through issuance. At
commercial banks, partial data indicate growth of total real estate
loans excluding home equity loans increased to a 5-3/4 percent
annual rate in October following a 4-1/4 percent pace in the third
quarter.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has finalized
1993 and 1994 lending goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie
Mae will be required to increase the share of dwelling units it
finances (including securitizations) that are low- and moderate-
income from 28 percent in 1992 to 30 percent in 1993 and 1994, while
Freddie Mac must increase its share from 24 percent in 1992 to 28
percent in 1993 and 30 percent in 1994. Similar increases have been
established for lending in central cities. To help achieve these
goals, Fannie Mae has introduced a program under which it will
package and issue securities backed by senior claims on multifamily
mortgages.

Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at a 10-1/2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in September, up from an 8
percent rate in August. Revolving credit (mainly credit cards)
remains the fastest growing component of consumer credit. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that some of the 1993 pickup in this component may
be the result of increasing "convenience" use--particularly of cards
with rebate features. Auto credit growth has also strengthened this
year, while "other" credit outstanding has run off a bit further.
Reflecting the pickup in consumer credit growth, the ratio of
outstanding consumer credit (installment plus noninstallment) to
disposable personal income has stabilized this year after declining
sharply over the previous three years (chart).
Through September, gross public issuance of securities backed
by consumer loans has continued at a pace near that of the past few
years. However, the volume of these instruments outstanding has
declined for the first time since this market developed in 1985.
Securities backed by automobile loans have been somewhat stronger
than other types of consumer asset-backed securities reflecting the
difficulties Chrysler and General Motors face in the commercial
paper market.
The overall decline in outstandings this year owes largely to a
substantial volume of credit card-backed securities entering paydown
status. When securities collateralized with credit card receivables
reach maturity, or reach the date at which they begin to pay back
principal to the investors, the underlying loan balances revert to
the books of the issuing institution. As a result, commercial
banks--by far the largest issuers--must either hold capital against
these loans or issue new securities to remove the loans from their
balance sheets again. It appears that much of the gross issuance of

credit card-backed securities this year is simply rolling over the
sizable volume of securities issued in 1989 and 1990 in preparation
for risk-based capital standards. A total of $3.7 billion of these
securities reached paydown status in 1992; such issues are expected
to total $14.7 billion this year and $6.7 billion in 1994.

Merchandise Trade
In August, the merchandise trade deficit was $9.7 billion
(seasonally adjusted, Census-basis), smaller than recorded in the
previous two months. For July-August combined the deficit at an
annual rate was about the same as recorded in the second quarter.
Data for September will be released on November 17.

Exports rose in August following two months of declines.
Aircraft and automotive products accounted for most of the increase
in August, just as they accounted for the decline in July. For
July-August combined exports were slightly lower than in the second
quarter, primarily reflecting temporarily lower shipments of
aircraft and automotive products. Deliveries of aircraft vary
sharply from month to month and exports in July were particularly
low. A decline in shipments of automotive products between U.S.
companies and their affiliates in Canada and Mexico in July, and a
return to more usual levels in August, affected both exports and
imports and reflected the effects of model change-over and labor
negotiations. On the other hand, increased exports were recorded in

July-August for computers, semiconductors, and consumer goods. By
area, most of the decline in July-August was to Canada and Western
Europe. Small increases were recorded in exports to Japan and
developing countries in Asia.
Imports in August rose less than 1 percent. A sharp increase
in imports of automotive products from Canada and consumer goods
(both reversing declines recorded in July) was partly offset by a
decline in imports of capital goods and oil. For July-August
combined imports were less than in the second quarter primarily
because of declines recorded in the value of imported oil and
automotive products. However, imported consumer goods grew at an 8
percent annual rate in July-August, similar to growth rates recorded
in the first and second quarters, and there were sizable increases
in imported computers and semiconductors. In addition, imported
machinery (excluding computers and semiconductors) continued at
relatively high levels having expanded strongly earlier this year.
Oil Imports. Both the price and the quantity of oil imports
fell in August, and declined as well in July-August compared to the
second quarter. Prices of oil imports have fallen for three
consecutive months, reflecting the slack demand and strong OPEC
production that characterized the oil market through most of the
summer. Preliminary data from the Department of Energy (DOE)
suggest that the declining volumes evident in July and August were

largely the result of a slowing in the robust rate of stockbuilding
in the second quarter. The DOE data show another decline in the
quantity of imported oil in September.
Since the last Greenbook, spot and futures oil prices have
moved in an uneven pattern, with little change on balance. The
agreement reached at the late September OPEC ministerial pushed the
near-term West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price up roughly $1.00 per
barrel to almost $19.00 per barrel. However, in the past several
weeks spot WTI has retreated about $1.50 per barrel on market
perceptions of weak demand. Currently, the near-term WTI contract
is trading near $16.75 per barrel. Given these movements in the
price of the near-term contract, the oil import unit value is likely
to remain near $15.15 per barrel through October.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports rose 0.2 percent in September
bringing the increase for the third quarter to 1.5 percent at an
annual rate on average; this was the second consecutive quarter in
which a price rise was recorded. In the third quarter, price
increases were recorded for imported capital goods, automotive
products, and foods; price declines occurred for non-oil industrial
supplies, apparel, footwear, and household goods.
Prices of nonagricultural products were unchanged on balance in
September, but declined 1.4 percent at an annual rate for the third
quarter on average; this was the first quarterly decline since the
fourth quarter of 1992. Decreases were recorded in all major trade
categories in the third quarter led by declines in prices of
exported building materials and automotive products. The decline in
prices of exported consumer goods was the first since the third
quarter of 1991. Prices of U.S. agricultural exports declined 0.7
percent in September, the first decline in three months.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Very large U.S. net purchases of foreign securities (line 2c of
the Summary of U.S. International Transactions Table) continued in
September, bringing the total for the third quarter to $46 billion.
Of this total, $25 billion were purchases of foreign stocks and $21
billion were purchases of foreign bonds.
About two-thirds of U.S. net purchases of foreign stocks in the
third quarter were from industrial countries, particularly the
United Kingdom. Other net purchases were scattered among Latin
American countries and Asian economies; the largest of these were
almost $2 billion from Hong Kong.
U.S. net purchases of foreign bonds in the third quarter were
even more concentrated. Purchases from the United Kingdom accounted
for the bulk of the total. However, since London is a Eurobond
center, it is likely that the borrowers were residents of a wider
range of countries. The volume of U.S. net purchases of foreign
bonds was swelled in September by large new issues of Yankee bonds
by the governments of Italy and Israel.
Net private foreign purchases of U.S. securities were also
strong in the third quarter. Private foreigners added $8 billion to
their holdings of U.S. government agency bonds and $7 billion to
their holdings of U.S. corporate debt (both included in line 2a).
The net increase in holdings of U.S. Treasury securities was more
modest (see line 3); however, the monthly movements were quite
volatile. Large foreign net purchases in August (coinciding with
the issue of long-term Treasury securities at the mid-quarter
refunding) were almost completely reversed in September. Almost
half the net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities in August were
recorded through Caribbean financial centers. Moreover, foreigners

were also substantial net purchasers of U.S. corporate stocks in
August and September.
Banks (line 1) reported very large net capital inflows in the
third quarter. Almost two-thirds of the net inflows occurred at
foreign agencies and branches and were associated with a shift from
U.S. to foreign sources of funding rather than asset growth. More
recent data on the net claims of U.S. banking offices on their own
foreign offices and IBFs suggest that inflows have continued on a
monthly average basis in October. (See line 1 of the International
Banking Data Table).
Foreigners also increased their claims on the United States in
the form of U.S. currency in recent months. Reports from selected
banks to the FRBNY indicate that net shipments to foreign countries
through September amounted to more than $15 billion this year, a
substantial unrecorded capital inflow in the U.S. international
transactions accounts.
Foreign official inflows were very substantial in the third
quarter. (See line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions Table.) Japan and Spain accounted for much of the net
increase in official holdings during the quarter. However, holdings
of Argentina and Mexico also increased by significant amounts.
Additional G-10 official inflows in October seem likely since
reported net intervention purchases of dollars were substantial.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dollar has
increased 2-1/2 percent since the September 21 FOMC meeting. The
dollar's strength in recent weeks has been due in large part to the
release of data which the market interpreted as indicating a
stronger U.S. economic expansion. This shift in market sentiment
toward a more optimistic outlook for U.S. growth also has been

reflected in the recent rise in U.S long-term interest rates. Since
September 21, the yield on the U.S. ten-year Treasury bond has
increased 20 basis points on balance. In contrast, the outlook for
growth in the major foreign industrial economies has deteriorated
recently, contributing to a 25 basis point decline in the weighted-
average of foreign long-term interest rates over this period.
The dollar has risen by 3-1/4 percent relative to the mark
since the last FOMC meeting. The dollar initially moved sharply
higher against the mark in reaction to the Russian political crisis
triggered by President Yeltsin's dissolution of the Russian
parliament on September 21. However, with the subsequent easing of
Russian political tensions, the safe haven premium on the dollar was
unwound. Almost all of the dollar's net rise against the mark has
taken place since the Bundesbank announced reductions in its
official interest rates on October 21. The discount and Lombard
rates were reduced 50 basis points, to 5-3/4 percent and 6-3/4
percent, respectively. The Bundesbank also lowered the rate at
which it supplies funds to the German money market through
repurchase operations by 30 basis points to 6.4 percent. In
subsequent days, interest rate reductions of a similar magnitude
were also announced by nearly all other European central banks.
Since the September 21 FOMC meeting, the German three-month
interest rate has declined by a little over 20 basis points to just
above 6.3 percent. Over this period, reductions in three-month
interest rates ranging from 10 to 60 basis points have been recorded
in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and
Switzerland.
The dollar has appreciated by 3/4 percent against the yen since
the September FOMC meeting. The yen has weakened in part due to
growing pessimism over the outlook for the Japanese economy.

IV-12
Reduced prospects for a near-term recovery have also fueled a sharp
drop in Japanese stock prices in recent weeks. The commonly cited
Nikkei 225 index has fallen by over 11 percent since the September
FOMC meeting, while the broader Topix index has declined by 7
percent. Japanese short-term interest rates have edged down only
slightly further since the September 21 announcement by the Bank of
Japan of a 75 basis point reduction in its discount rate to 1-3/4
percent. The Japanese three-month CD rate has declined 5 basis
points since September 21 to a record low level just over 2.3
percent.
The U.S. dollar has depreciated by 1 percent relative to the
Canadian dollar since the September 21 FOMC meeting. Political
developments related to the October 25 general election dominated
movements in the Canadian currency. The market appears on balance
to have been reassured that the new Liberal government has a stable
parliamentary majority and that the economic portfolios in the new
cabinet have gone to moderates.
The Mexican peso came under strong downward pressure last week
in response to growing concerns about the prospects for NAFTA.
Since late October, the peso has depreciated 3-1/2 percent against
the dollar; the Mexican stock market has remained about unchanged on
balance.
There was no intervention by U.S.
authorities.

IV-13
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Available data for the major foreign industrial countries give
a mixed picture of economic activity in recent months. In Japan,
recent indicators suggest that economic activity remained weak in
the third quarter following a decline in real GDP in the second
quarter. Real economic activity in western Germany appears to have
stagnated in the third quarter after increasing moderately in the
second quarter. Recent indicators suggest that the recessions in
France and Italy may have bottomed out. The United Kingdom's modest
recovery continued in the third quarter, while the pace of Canada's
recovery appears to have slowed.
Inflation in the foreign industrial countries continues to hold
steady. In Japan, small increases in the rate of inflation earlier
this year resulted primarily from special factors and have largely
been reversed. In western Germany, consumer price inflation has
started to slow as price pressures in services and housing have
begun to moderate.
The German constitutional court on October 12 ruled that the
Maastricht Treaty on European Union does not violate Germany's
constitution, and on November 1 the Maastricht Treaty went into
effect. Frankfurt was chosen as the site of the European Monetary
Institute, which will eventually be replaced by an EC central bank.
Alexandre Lamfalussy, currently General Manager of the BIS, was
nominated to be the first president of the European Monetary
Institute.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, data suggest that economic
activity remained weak in the third quarter following a 1.6 percent
(s.a.a.r.) decline in real GDP in the second quarter. Industrial
production (s.a.) was nearly unchanged in the July-September period
after declining 1.5 percent in the second quarter. Retail sales

(n.s.a.) declined 4.3 percent in the third quarter from their year-
earlier level, down marginally from the second quarter. The ratio
of job offers to applicants (s.a.) declined over the third quarter
to 0.69 in September, while the unemployment rate rose slightly to
2.6 percent. Among more positive indicators, new machinery orders
(s.a.) rose 2.3 percent in the third quarter after falling 9.5
percent in the second quarter. The index of leading indicators
returned to the boom/bust demarcation line of 50 in August, after a
low of 30.8 in June. Housing starts (s.a.) were 9.3 percent higher
in the third quarter than in the second, while new car registrations
(s.a.) were up 2.1 percent.

The growth of consumer prices in the Tokyo area (n.s.a.)
declined to 1.2 percent on a 12-month basis in October, reflecting a
reversal of the surge in fresh food prices that had boosted overall
consumer prices over the summer. Excluding perishables, Tokyo
consumer prices also rose 1.2 percent on a 12-month basis in
October, below the rate in the first half of 1993. In part
reflecting the cumulative appreciation of the yen, wholesale prices
continued to decline in September, falling 3.7 percent below their
year-earlier level.

IV-18
The trade surplus (customs basis, s.a.) moved up to $9.6
billion in September from $8.9 billion in August. The September
current account surplus (s.a.) rose to $11.2 billion from $9.5
billion in August; the cumulative surplus for the first nine months
of 1993 was $133 billion at an annual rate, up considerably from
last year.
The protracted slowdown in economic activity, as well as the
appreciation of the yen over the last year, led the Bank of Japan to
lower its discount rate on September 21 by 75 basis points to 1.75
percent; it was the seventh reduction since June 1991 and brought
the discount rate to its lowest level in the post-war period. This
move, which followed the September 16 announcement of a 6 trillion
yen (about 1.3 percent of GDP) stimulus package, has not sufficed to
reduce official concerns about the economic outlook. It is
anticipated that in a preliminary report scheduled for release on
November 16, the Government Tax Council, an advisory body to the
prime minister, will recommend a 5 to 6 trillion yen cut in personal
taxes, to be offset by an increase in the consumption tax rate one
or two years later.
In western Germany, real economic activity appears to have
stagnated in the third quarter after increasing moderately in the
second quarter. This reinforces the view that much of the gain in
real GDP in the second quarter may have resulted from unintended
accumulation of inventories. Industrial production (s.a.) remained
unchanged on average in the second and third quarters. After
increasing 2.2 percent in August, production fell back 2 percent in
September to a level 7.6 percent below its year-earlier level. In
the third quarter, capacity utilization slipped to a 10-year low.
In the first three quarters of the year, west German car production
plummeted, and new passenger car registrations dropped sharply. The

IV-19
volume of new orders for western German manufactured goods (s.a.)
has shown some signs of improvement recently, increasing 1.2 percent
in the third quarter from the second-quarter average. The
unemployment rate (s.a., as a percent of the dependent labor force)
rose to 8.8 percent in October. Rising unemployment has put
downward pressure on wage growth, which has moderated considerably
this year and should continue to slow in the upcoming wage
negotiations.

Consumer prices in western Germany increased 3.9 percent in
October from a year earlier. This is the first time inflation has
been below 4 percent since the increase in the value-added tax at
the beginning of this year. Wholesale, producer, and import prices
(n.s.a.) remained on a downward trend in September.
In September, M3 was 6.8 percent (s.a.a.r) higher than the
average of the fourth quarter of 1992. This is down somewhat from
growth rates recorded in July and August, but still slightly above
the 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent target range.
According to preliminary figures, the pan-German current
account deficit (n.s.a.) in the first eight months of 1993 was $18.8
billion, about the same as the deficit recorded in the corresponding
period last year, despite a large increase in the trade surplus over
this period.

IV-20
In France, real GDP was flat in the second quarter as a modest
increase in consumption offset negative contributions from
investment and inventories. In the third quarter, there were signs
of a recovery in economic activity. The July-August average of
industrial production (s.a.) was 1.1 percent above its second-
quarter average. In September, industrial production appeared to be
flat according to a Bank of France survey. In the third quarter,
consumption of manufactured products (s.a.), a third of total
consumption, was 2.1 percent above its second-quarter average.
However, the unemployment rate (s.a.) has continued to rise,
reaching 11.8 percent in September.
Recent increases in French inflation are likely to prove
transitory. Consumer prices (n.s.a.) in September were 2.3 percent
higher than a year earlier, up slightly from 2.2 percent in August.
Most of the rise in inflation from an average of roughly 2 percent
in the first half of the year can be attributed to increases in
excise taxes on tobacco and gasoline.
France's trade surplus (s.a.) increased to $1.8 billion in
July, up from a revised $774 million in June and down only slightly
from the record $2 billion registered in May. The cumulative
surplus for the first seven months of 1993 was $8.2 billion, double
the surplus registered over the same period last year. The
improvement is due to a large drop in imports associated in part
with the collapse of investment in the first half of the year.
France also registered a record bilateral trade surplus with Germany
of $278 million in July. (In the past, France has typically run a
trade deficit with Germany).
The French government privatised BNP, France's largest bank,
selling $4.8 billion worth of shares to 2.8 million shareholders. A
portion of BNP shares were reserved for a "hard core" of investors

IV-21
committed to holding their shares for a long period and to
overseeing management operations. This hard core includes foreign
as well as French firms. The initial subscription was
oversubscribed by 12 times, in part because the issue price was
significantly below the market price, leading the government to
reduce the portion of shares reserved for the hard core to
accommodate some of this demand. The government also intends to
privatise the chemical company Rhone-Poulenc this year and should be
able to reach its target level of revenues of $7-1/2 billion.
In the United Kingdom, real GDP increased 2.3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, up from 2.1 percent in the first
quarter. The U.K.'s modest recovery appears to have continued into
the third quarter. According to provisional estimates, real GDP
growth continued at 2.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter.
Robust growth in services and energy production offset declines in
manufacturing production. The unemployment rate (s.a.) edged down
slightly to 10.3 percent in September. Business sentiment (s.a.)
fell back somewhat in the third quarter from the strong second-
quarter average. In October, MO was 5.4 percent above its level a
year earlier; the increase, the largest in over three years, may
indicate continued recovery in domestic expenditure. The Purchasing
Managers' Index indicated a sharp increase in output and new orders
in October. In contrast, consumer confidence (s.a.) weakened
considerably further in October, after falling in the third quarter
from its strong second-quarter average.
In September, consumer prices (n.s.a.) increased 1.8 percent on
a 12-month basis. Excluding mortgage interest rates, consumer
prices were 3.3 percent above their level of September 1992. Cost
pressures associated with the depreciation of sterling continued to
ease. Producers' input prices stabilized in October after falling

IV-22
for the previous six months and stood 0.9 percent higher than their
level a year earlier (and 4.9 percent higher than in August 1992,
prior to sterling's devaluation). In addition, labor costs continue
to moderate. In August. the underlying rate of inflation in
earnings was 3.5 percent, down from 5.8 percent in August 1992.
In July, the trade deficit (s.a.) worsened to $2.4 billion from
an average monthly balance of $1.8 billion in the second quarter.
The cumulative deficit for the first seven months of 1993 was $13
billion, up slightly from the same period last year despite the
large depreciation of the pound. Domestic-currency prices of
exports have increased nearly in line with the effective
depreciation of the pound, giving little boost to the
competitiveness of U.K. goods. In August and September, the trade
deficit with non-EC trading partners (the only figures available)
continued to worsen due to rapid growth of imports.
In Italy, economic activity may be nearing its cyclical trough.
Following three consecutive quarters of negative change, real GDP
rose 3.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter. However, the
components suggest underlying weakness. Domestic demand climbed 2.2
percent only on the strength of inventory accumulation and stronger
government spending, which, given the government's desire to reduce
the budget deficit, is unlikely to persist. Private consumption and
fixed investment fell for the fourth and sixth consecutive quarter,
respectively. Net exports added 0.9 percentage points to GDP growth
as imports fell more than exports.
More recent indicators remain mixed. Industrial production
(s.a.) rose 0.9 percent in July but remains 0.3 percent below the
second-quarter average. The unemployment rate (n.s.a.) dipped
slightly to 13.6 percent in the third quarter. Consumer and

IV-23
business confidence remain depressed, and real retail sales are
flat.
Due largely to the 20 percent effective depreciation of the
lira since September 1992, wholesale and producer price inflation
rates have increased. In the year to August, wholesale and producer
price inflation (n.s.a.) averaged 5.2 percent and 3.7 percent,
respectively, up from rates registered in 1992. However, weakness
in economic activity has contributed to a slowing in consumer price
inflation. In the year to October, consumer price rises (n.s.a.)
averaged 4.3 percent, down from the average rate of 5.3 percent
recorded in 1992.
The falling lira and weak economic activity produced seven
consecutive monthly trade surpluses through July. Although Italy
incurred a trade deficit (s.a.) of $200 million in August, the
cumulative trade surplus for the year totaled $13 billion. During
the same period in 1992, Italy recorded an $8 billion trade deficit.
The current account deficit (n.s.a.) in the first half of 1993
totalled $100 million, down from $14.3 billion recorded in the first
half of 1992.
Economic indicators for Canada suggest that the pace of the
recovery slowed in the third quarter. The July-August average of
monthly GDP at factor cost (s.a.) rose only 0.3 percent above the
second-quarter level, a considerably slower rate than those in the
first and second quarters. In addition, the growth of industrial
production has slowed substantially from the rapid first-quarter
rate. After three successive quarterly increases, business
confidence dropped sharply in the third quarter from the previous
quarter, but is still up 6.4 percent from its level a year earlier.
Indicators of household demand show moderate growth, as retail trade
in July and August increased slightly from the second-quarter level,

IV-24
and consumer confidence grew marginally after large increases in the
first half of the year. The housing market remains sluggish.
Conditions in the labor market remain weak. Average total
civilian employment (s.a.) for the third quarter grew slightly over
the second-quarter level. However, employment growth was
accompanied by an increase in labor force participation, and the
average unemployment rate (s.a.) for the third quarter was unchanged
from the second quarter at 11.4 percent. Most of the gains in
employment have been for youths; adult employment has been little
changed since June.
Inflation remains moderate, despite some upward pressure on
prices from the decline in the Canadian dollar. The 12-month change
in the CPI excluding food and energy was 2.2 percent (n.s.a.) in
September, up from 1.8 percent in both July and August largely due
to special factors. Inflation remains below the Bank of Canada's
target of 2-1/2 percent for mid-1994.
Merchandise exports increased slightly on average in July and
August, well below the pace of the first quarter, while imports grew
strongly in August, and the trade surplus narrowed. An encouraging
note is that much of the August increase in imports was for
machinery and equipment.
Jean Chretien led the Liberal Party to a sweeping victory in
the October 25 general election, capturing a sizable majority of
Parliament seats. The Progressive Conservative party held on to
only two seats, while large gains were made by the Quebec separatist
party, the Bloc Quebecois, and another regional party, Reform.
Chretien appointed Paul Martin, a moderate within the Liberal Party,
as Finance Minister. Martin indicated on November 4 that
maintaining low inflation is an important concern of the Liberal
government.

IV-25
Economic Situation in Other Countries
Mexico announced an economic stimulus package to be implemented
in January 1994, amid indications that economic activity continued
to slow during the third quarter. Mexico's financial markets are
showing signs of nervousness as the U.S. Congress prepares to vote
on NAFTA.
Brazil's consumer prices increased 37 percent during September,
continuing the climb seen in recent months. Argentina, however, has
achieved its lowest inflation rate in two decades, with consumer
prices rising only 8.1 percent in the year ending October. In
China, the twelve-month urban inflation rate fell slightly in
August, but remained above 20 percent. Chinese officials appear to
be wavering in their commitment to the retrenchment program
announced in July. Inflation in Korea and Taiwan remains at low
levels.
During the first half of 1993, Taiwan experienced its weakest
current account performance in ten years. China's trade deficit
increased to $7 billion during the first nine months of this year, a
sharp reversal of last year's $5 billion surplus for the comparable
period.
Individual country notes. Mexico's real GDP growth in the
third quarter appears to have been weaker than the second-quarter
growth of 0.3 percent and may have been negative. Economic activity
this year has been slowed by tight monetary and fiscal policies
designed to control inflation and improve the balance of payments
position. Uncertainty about the fate of NAFTA in the U.S. Congress
has contributed to weaker growth by discouraging investment.
In response to the slowdown, the government has announced an
economic stimulus package to take effect January 1, 1994. The
package includes cuts in individual and corporate tax rates, larger

IV-26
exemptions and credits for low income taxpayers, and accelerated
depreciation for investments in anti-pollution equipment. How this
package fits into the total fiscal picture will not be known until
the 1994 budget is unveiled in mid-November. For 1993, a small
overall deficit appears likely. The fiscal balance, which was in
surplus in the first half of the year, went into deficit in the
third quarter.
On November 3, when the financial markets reopened after being
closed for holidays, the peso/dollar exchange rate, which had
changed little for about a year, came under strong pressure. On
November 10, the exchange rate was 3.3 percent below its October 29
level, and 2.6 percent above the lower limit of its fluctuation
band. Market participants have evidently become nervous about the
forthcoming U.S. Congress vote on NAFTA and have begun to sell
Mexican investments and to buy foreign exchange. On November 9, the
Mexican stock market closed 3.3 percent below its pre-holiday level.
Pressure has also been evident in the government securities
market. On November 10, the 28-day rate was 17.23 percent, 377
basis points higher than a week earlier. Since November 3, the Bank
of Mexico has purchased large amounts of peso-denominated Treasury
bills in the secondary market in an attempt to moderate this
increase. On November 9, the Bank's reported purchases included
1 billion pesos of one-day bills at a price yielding 23 percent.
Secondary market prices of Mexican long-term public sector
debt, expressed as a percentage of face value, fell by more than 4
percentage points between October 29 and November 9.
International reserves, including about $200 million in gold,
were $23 billion at the end of October, $400 million more than in
August, but an estimated $1.7 billion less than the April peak.

In October, the CPI increased 0.4 percent, the smallest monthly
increase in twenty years; this leaves consumer prices 9.1 percent
higher than a year earlier.
In Brazil, business surveys and anecdotal evidence suggest that
economic activity has stagnated in recent weeks. Additionally,
inflation continues to climb. The CPI rose by 37 percent during
September, compared with monthly increases of 33.5 percent in August
and 30 percent in July. Cumulative imports for the year through
September were 28.2 percent above a year earlier. Cumulative
exports through September were 10.6 percent higher than in 1992. As
a result, Brazil's cumulative trade surplus fell to $10 billion from
the $11.4 billion surplus registered during the same period in 1992.
In late October 1993, Brazil's Senate approved a resolution
outlining repayment options for the country's $35 billion Brady-
style commercial bank debt restructuring agreement. To conclude
this agreement, scheduled to be signed in late November. Brazil must
either obtain an IMF stand-by arrangement or purchase the collateral
(U.S. Treasury bonds) using its international reserves. In early
November, the deadline for implementation of the package was moved
from February 1994 to April 1994, due to Brazil's recurrent failure
to obtain an IMF stand-by arrangement and its unwillingness to
purchase the collateral (this is the third time the implementation
date has been postponed).
There continues to be a lack of political commitment to
implement needed fiscal and monetary reforms. A number of fiscal
reforms were to be considered during the review of the 1988
constitution, scheduled to last from early October to early December
1993. However, in recent weeks, Brazil's latest political scandal
(over 30 prominent politicians have been accused of corruption) has

IV-28
diverted the attention of the political elite from the country's
pressing economic problems.
In Argentina, consumer price inflation for the year ending
October 1993 fell to 8.1 percent, down significantly from the 18
percent rate registered a year earlier. The trade balance, however,
continued to deteriorate. During the first eight months of 1993,
the trade deficit reached $1.6 billion (including a $483 million
deficit in August alone), compared with a $1.2 billion deficit
during January-August 1992.
In late September, the Argentine congress gave final approval
to a package of social security reforms. This legislation
strengthens incentives to pay social security taxes by allowing
employees to direct their contributions to private pension funds and
by requiring each individual to make contributions for at least 30
years to qualify for retirement benefits. These reforms are
expected to raise the level of domestic saving and to facilitate the
enforcement of payroll tax compliance by employers. The package
also raises the retirement age and reduces the level of publicly
guaranteed benefits.
As part of Argentina's Brady-style agreement with commercial
bank creditors, about 85 percent of outstanding interest arrears
were settled in late October. At that time, $6.6 billion in 12-year
non-collateralized floating-rate bonds and a cash payment of $636
million were released from escrow. Remaining arrears should be
cleared by mid-December when final reconciliation is completed.
Chinese authorities appear to have backtracked from the tight
credit path announced in the July retrenchment program. Although M2
growth (year-on-year) fell in the third quarter to 22.1 percent from
25.9 percent in the second quarter, the central bank injected 100
billion yuan of base money (about 10 percent of the end-June

IV-29
monetary base) into the economy during August and September in an
attempt to alleviate credit shortages. Authorities also project an
increase of 200 billion yuan of new credit in the fourth quarter to
pay for agricultural harvests and year-end enterprise demand for
funds.
Despite the central bank's wavering, the retrenchment efforts
appear to have had some impact. Industrial production in September
was 19.1 percent higher than a year earlier, a slower rate of growth
than August's 23.4 percent increase and markedly slower than the
record-setting 30.2 percent rise registered in June. Urban
inflation was 22.2 percent for the year ending in August, a decline
from July's 23.3 percent increase. The retrenchment also seems to
have quashed speculative real estate bubbles that had developed in
several regions. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that the
credit slowdown has hurt a variety of state-owned and private firms
and has caused inter-enterprise arrears to reappear as a significant
economic problem (as during 1988-89).
Through September, the Chinese merchandise trade deficit stood
at $7 billion, compared with a $5 billion surplus for the same
period in 1992. This reversal has been due primarily to a 30
percent increase in imports. The exchange value of the yuan has
stabilized at around 8.7 yuan to the dollar in the country's swap
exchange markets.
In Taiwan, real GDP grew 6.1 percent in the first half of 1993,
continuing a modest slowdown reflecting relatively weak growth in
world demand for the country's exports. Taiwan's merchandise trade
surplus stood at $6.4 billion between January and October, as
exports grew 4.7 percent and imports grew 8.6 percent. The current
account surplus for the first six months of 1993 was $3 billion, the
smallest total since the first half of 1983. Notably, however,

IV-30
trade with China has grown robustly. During the first eight months
of 1993, Chinese-Taiwanese trade was 21.3 percent above its 1992
level. Inflation has continued at a moderate rate, with the CPI in
October only 1.2 percent higher than a year ago (a typhoon caused a
temporary increase in consumer prices during autumn 1992). On
November 5, the central bank reduced its discount rate by 12.5 basis
points to 5.5 percent, after lowering reserve requirements for
various deposits by about 1 percent in September. These measures,
however, appear too modest to have a significant effect on the
economy.
Although economic activity in Korea has remained weak relative
to historical standards, tight credit conditions resulting from the
mid-August "real-name" reform appear to have eased. The Bank of
Korea has attempted to cushion the impact of the reform by adopting
a less stringent monetary policy and has achieved a significant
reduction in interest rates in recent weeks. Despite the looser
monetary policy, inflation seems to have remained stable: the
consumer price index was 5.1 percent higher in October than a year
earlier.
In the first nine months of 1993, exports grew 7.3 percent and
imports increased only 1 percent from the same period a year
earlier. As a result, the current account deficit over the first
nine months of 1993 narrowed to $1 billion from $4.8 billion over
the same period in 1992.
On November 1, the Korean government implemented the second
stage of its four-step plan to deregulate interest rates. This
reform, at least in principle, allows financial institutions to set
interest rates on deposits with a maturity exceeding two years, on
corporate bonds with a maturity of less than two years, and on all
loans except for policy loans (policy loans account for about 40

IV-31
percent of total loans). The first stage of this deregulation plan,
implemented in November 1991, freed interest rates on most money
market instruments including bank overdrafts, large-scale repurchase
agreements, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds with a
maturity of more than two years.
Economic activity in Russia has declined sharply in recent
months. Measured real GDP in the third quarter of 1993 was 11
percent lower than a year earlier. Monthly industrial production,
which was roughly stable over the first seven months of the year.
has reportedly fallen by 22 percent between July and September.
This economic contraction partially reflects a tightening of
monetary policy. The Russian central bank gradually raised its
monthly refinance rate from 6.7 percent in January to 17.5 percent
in October. Average monthly growth of ruble M2 fell from 20 percent
for March-May to 11 percent for June-August. Monthly inflation
declined from 29 percent in August to 21 percent in September.
The ruble traded at 1,176 per dollar in the Moscow MICEX
auction of November 8. The currency plummeted during the early-
October confrontation between President Yeltsin and Russian
parliamentarians, but has now recovered about half of its losses
against the dollar. Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan. Tajikstan
and Uzbekistan agreed in principle last month to continue to use the
ruble as their currency. However, difficulties in completing this
agreement subsequently led Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to develop
plans to issue their own currencies by the end of 1993.
Russia's uneven macroeconomic performance over the last several
months has precluded the disbursement of another $1.5 billion under
the IMF's Structural Transformation Facility and has impeded efforts
to obtain an IMF stand-by arrangement. Yeltsin's recent political
successes may enable Russia to implement macroeconomic reform more

IV-32
consistently over the next several months, opening the way for
further IMF assistance.
In Poland, the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant
Party (PSL) have formed a coalition government led by Waldemar
Pawlak of the PSL. Despite its communist roots, the Pawlak
government has been cautious in its approach to economic policy.
Initial indications suggest that it will not deviate significantly
from the approach of its predecessor: the new government has
endorsed privatization and vowed to continue the fight against
inflation. The details of the government's economic plan, however,
will not be known until the 1994 budget is released on December 29.
After months of debate with the Ministry of Finance, the
National Bank of Poland (NBP) agreed on November 2 to finance an
additional $400 million of the government's budget deficit. The NBP
asserted that this action will not push 1993 inflation beyond 32-35
percent, the NBP's previously announced target. Money creation this
year has been less than planned, and several expected inflationary
impulses have not materialized.
