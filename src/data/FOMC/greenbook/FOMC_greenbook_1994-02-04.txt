DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Real gross domestic product advanced at a 6 percent annual rare
in the fourth quarter, with strong gains in outlays for consumer
durables, business fixed investment, and residential construction.
A number of leading indicators in these sectors ended the year
pointing upward, suggesting good momentum for activity in the
current quarter. Although the prices of some durable materials have
reflected increased pressures on supply, broader measures of wages
and prices show no signs of acceleration.
The Labor Market
The labor market continued to firm in December across a broad
front. The unemployment rate edged down to 6.4 percent, almost a
point less than the reading a year earlier. Nonfarm payroll
employment increased 183,000 in December and, for 1993 as a whole,
was up almost 2 million. Anecdotal reports indicate that the recent
severe weather and the Los Angeles earthquake caused some transitory
reductions in hours worked and in employment, but the recent levels
of unemployment insurance claims suggest that the underlying rate of
job growth has not changed greatly since the December labor market
survey.
The December gains in nonfarm payroll employment were
widespread, with the strongest increases in the private service-
producing sector. Retail trade added 32,000 jobs, as sizable gains
at eating and drinking establishments and at automobile dealerships
more than offset less-than-seasonal hiring at general merchandise
stores. Employment in services rose 68,000. The personnel supply
component of this group, which is dominated by temporary-help firms.
added 36,000 workers. Although personnel supply firms represent
only 2 percent of total payroll employment, these firms accounted

for nearly one-fifth of the overall gain in total payroll employment
last year.
Manufacturing employment was little changed in December, after
an increase of more than 35.000 over the previous two months. The
level of manufacturing employment at the end of last year was about
175,000 lower than a year earlier; however, this figure overstates
the decline, because an increasing share of the individuals hired by
temporary agencies (and thus counted as employees at personnel
supply firms) reportedly worked in the manufacturing sector. After
posting strong increases in the previous two months, construction
payrolls were little changed in December. Employment in this sector
rose 200,000 last year--its first annual gain since 1989.
The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers
stood at 34.6 hours in December, 1/2 hour above its cyclical trough.
Typically, the workweek increases during the first year or two of an
expansion and then recedes. In the current cycle, by contrast, the
uptrend in the workweek continued into the third year of the
expansion. Much of the overall increase has occurred in
manufacturing, for which the December reading, at 41.7 hours, is the
highest since World War II.
The employment measure from the household survey increased
330,000 in December: for 1993 as a whole this series showed an
increase of 2-1/2 million, compared with a rise of about 2 million
in the payroll series.1 However, the strength in employment does
not yet appear to have drawn a great many more workers into the
labor force. The labor force participation rate, although up

differences, a large increase in self-employed workers offset
declines in private household workers and unpaid absences. These
categories are included in the household series but not the payroll
series.

slightly during the last few months of 1993, has been essentially
flat during the current expansion.
Beginning with the data for January 1994, statistics from the
Current Population Survey (CPS) will be adjusted using population
controls from the 1990 decennial census. If these controls had been
applied to the 1993 statistics, the annual levels of employment and
unemployment would have been 934,000 and 203,000 higher
respectively, raising the unemployment rate 0.1 percentage point.
A more profound change will occur with the introduction of the
redesigned CPS in January. The new survey should produce more
accurate statistics on several aspects of labor market behavior,
most notably the unemployment rate. However, the changeover will
create a break in the official series beginning with the January
data.
From July 1992 to December 1993, a separate, parallel survey
was conducted using the redesigned questionnaire and procedures (but
a much smaller sample). During 1993, the unemployment rate measured
by the parallel survey was about 1/2 percentage point higher, on
average, than the currently published data (chart, upper panel).
One important reason for the difference is that, in the old survey,
the wording of the initial questions on labor force activity caused
some women to be misclassified as being "out of the labor force."
This so-called gender bias has been corrected in the new survey.
Other reasons for the difference include modified questions about
layoff status and job-search activities, which, compared with the
old survey, will probably result in an increase in workers
classified as being on layoff as well as in those actively seeking
jobs.
Because the new CPS will introduce a break in the civilian
unemployment rate, looking at other indicators that offer a

continuous picture of labor market conditions between last year and
this year will be useful. One approach is to identify subcategories
of the civilian unemployment rate that are not expected to be
materially affected by the survey redesign and that also show
cyclical patterns similar to those of the overall unemployment rate.
Until recently, data from the parallel survey indicated that the
rates for white males and for adult males met these criteria.
However, in recent months the movements of both series in the
current CPS survey have diverged from their counterparts in the
parallel survey, indicating that these unemployment rates may not be
so immune from the survey redesign as the early data had suggested
(middle and lower panels of the chart).
Two other indicators, neither of which is based on CPS data,
are the state-insured unemployment rate and the labor-market vacancy
rate. The state-insured unemployment rate (chart, upper panel) was
closely aligned with the civilian jobless rate in the 1970s, but a
tightening of state eligibility requirements in the early 1980s
lowered the insured unemployment rate relative to the civilian
series. Nonetheless, these series show broadly similar cyclical
movements. The vacancy rate (lower panel), which is based on the
Conference Board's help-wanted index, also moved in line with the
unemployment rate in the 1970s and early 1980s; however, the
relationship between the levels of these series has changed
dramatically in recent years.2 Still, as with the state
unemployment rate, the cyclical patterns in these series appear to
be quite similar.
2. The Conference Board's help-wanted index is adjusted using
factors, estimated by Katharine Abraham (the current BLS
Commissioner), that control for changes in advertising practices
over time and for consolidation in the newspaper industry. The
vacancy rate is equal to the adjusted help-wanted index divided by
nonfarm payroll employment.

Industrial Production
The industrial production index rose 0.7 percent in December
and, for the fourth quarter as a whole, posted a gain of
7-1/2 percent at an annual rate. Manufacturing output also grew
0.7 percent in December, led by motor vehicles and business
equipment. With the continued rise in industrial production, the
operating rate in manufacturing increased to 82.7 percent.3
In December, output of motor vehicles and parts directly
contributed 0.3 percentage point to the growth of industrial
production; total assemblies increased 1/2 million units at an
annual rate to 12.5 million units, the highest level since the first
quarter of 1979. Current schedules call for assemblies to move
higher in January and February and then to ease a bit. The severe

units relative to those that had been scheduled earlier in the
month. Domestic producers have said that they plan to make up most
of the lost output later this quarter.
Outside-of the motor vehicle industry, manufacturing production
grew 0.4 percent in December, after a 0.7 gain in November. Much of
this advance was in motor vehicle-related industries, such as tires,
steel, and metal stampings, and in business equipment other than
aircraft and parts. Production of office and computing equipment
posted another hefty increase, and output of other industrial and
business equipment posted solid gains. Aircraft production,
however, continued to shrink late last year; Boeing has scheduled
further cuts in aircraft assemblies during the first half of this
year.
Elsewhere, output growth was mixed in December. Production of
consumer goods, excluding autos and trucks, decreased because output
of nondurables remained sluggish and production of other durables
reversed some of the large increases in the previous two months.
For the year as a whole, output of consumer durables other than
motor vehicles grew more than 7 percent, whereas production of
nondurables declined a bit. Output of materials and of construction
supplies continued to advance last month. Finally, utilities output
increased 1 percent in December; part of the gain probably stemmed
from unseasonably cold weather late in the month.
The staff's series for orders of real adjusted durable goods
rose 1-3/4 percent in December and increased more than 6 percent for
the fourth quarter as a whole. In particular, new orders for
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft have been running ahead
of shipments; and, as a result, backlogs have risen.
However, in January, severe weather temporarily disrupted
output in some parts of the country. In addition to the effect on

motor vehicles (noted above), production of steel appears to have
been reduced considerably. Anecdotal information for other
industries suggests that the severe weather had scattered adverse
effects on January production. These negative effects were
offset, in part, by a surge in the output at utilities.
As production strengthened during the final three months of
1993, manufacturing capacity utilization jumped 1-3/4 percentage
points to a level of 82.7 percent, about 1-1/2 percentage points
above the average level during the previous 25 years. Utilization
in both primary-processing and advanced-processing industries
increased considerably last year.
Experience has shown that when manufacturing operating rates
move above their long-term averages, prices for related goods and
materials tend to accelerate. However, to date the pickup in these
prices has been rather muted overall. One possible explanation is
that ample worldwide capacity has limited the ability of U.S.
producers to raise prices. Indeed, detailed industry data show that

industries with the highest utilization rates--such as lumber and
wood products, cement, iron and steel, and nonferrous metals--have
experienced a rise in import penetration, thus boosting supply to
the U.S. market. The behavior of output prices for these industries
has varied widely, however. Prices of nonferrous metals have
declined dramatically. But producer prices for the other industries
noted above have risen considerably--and in the case of lumber,
quite considerably. For these industries, imports may have lessened
the price impact of increases in demand but did not fully alleviate
them.
Motor Vehicles
Light vehicle sales rose sharply in the fourth quarter to an
annual rate of 14-1/2 million units, raising sales for 1993 as a
whole to nearly 14 million units. At year-end, inventories of
domestic makes were generally fairly lean.
According to confidential data supplied by GM and Ford, fleet
sales were depressed last summer (chart, lower panel). In the face
of supply disruptions, the automakers lowered sales to their
business customers. When these problems were allayed last fall,
light vehicle sales to businesses rebounded. Nonetheless, because
the level of fleet sales at the end of last year was still at a
relatively low level, and some further pickup would appear to be
likely early this year. Indeed, according to sources at GM, the
company has a substantial backlog of unfilled orders from rental
companies that it intends to fill before the beginning of April.
Light truck sales rose to a pace of 5.6 million units last quarter.
one of the highest levels on record, as generous incentives
associated with the sales contest between Ford and Chevrolet
temporarily boosted deliveries.

Because automakers stopped releasing ten-day sales data at
year-end, no direct indicators of light vehicle demand are yet
available for January. However, the Michigan index on buying
conditions for cars rose again in January to its highest level since
1986, suggesting that demand may have continued strong early this
year.
Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending has continued to post solid gains: Real PCE
advanced at a 4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, boosted
by double-digit growth in spending on durable goods. Real outlays
on motor vehicles are estimated to have jumped more than 20 percent
at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. At the same time, real
outlays for other durable goods increased at an annual rate of
nearly 10 percent, led by further rapid gains in spending on
furniture, appliances, and other household equipment. Historical
correlations suggest that the strength in spending on these
household durable goods likely stems, in large part, from increases
in the volume of housing activity (chart).
In contrast to the robust gains for durables, spending on
nondurable goods and services rose only moderately in the fourth
quarter. Real spending on nondurables climbed 2.6 percent at an
annual rate, held back by lackluster holiday demand at apparel and
general merchandise outlets. Spending on services grew at a
2.2 percent annual rate. Energy services declined in the fourth
quarter after a weather-related surge in the third quarter, but
spending on non-energy services was also anemic.
5. Based on data for heating-degree days covering the January
cold snap, the frigid weather appears likely to have boosted
consumer spending on energy services $4 billion to $5 billion (at an
annual rate) in January. An increase of this size would likely
offset most, if not all, of the weather-related loss of retail sales
during the month.

Real disposable personal income rose at an annual rate of
5.2 percent in the fourth quarter. Much of the gain can be
attributed to a rebound in farm income, which had been depressed by
flood-related crop losses in the preceding quarter. Averaging the
third and fourth quarters to remove this effect, real DPI increased
at an annual rate of about 3-1/2 percent. This rate of income
growth over the second half of 1993. although quite healthy, lagged
somewhat behind the 4-1/4 percent rate of advance in real consumer
spending over the period. As a result, the personal saving rate
edged down somewhat further, to a level of 4.1 percent in the fourth
quarter.
The pickup in consumer confidence that began last September
continued early this year. Both the Conference Board and the
Michigan indexes of consumer sentiment moved up further in December
and January, reflecting improvements in consumers' expectations of
future conditions and in their assessments of current conditions.
The January level of the Conference Board index was the highest
since September 1990, whereas the Michigan index reached the highest
level since September 1989. In addition, the Michigan index of
future employment conditions, which deteriorated over much of 1993,
has revealed considerably less anxiety about job prospects in recent
months.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment advanced at an annual rate of
21 percent in the fourth quarter, as equipment spending moved up at
a double-digit annual rate for the seventh straight quarter, and
real outlays for nonresidential structures posted the largest
quarterly rise in six years. Over 1993 as a whole, real business
fixed investment increased nearly 15 percent, reflecting enormous

gains for computers, solid advances for most other equipment, and a
turnaround in nonresidential construction.
Recent data on new orders for nondefense capital goods have
been very strong and suggest further gains in shipments in early
1994. Bookings for office and computing equipment jumped more than
13 percent last quarter, and orders for other types of equipment
(excluding aircraft) were up 10-3/4 percent, reflecting gains in
most of the components.
In the transportation sector, as mentioned previously, business
purchases of light motor vehicles bounced back in the fourth
quarter. The demand for heavy trucks has also continued to be
strong. The three major domestic manufacturers of heavy trucks are
all operating at or near capacity, with backlogs stretching into
midyear.6 Elsewhere, spending on aircraft plunged in the fourth
quarter and will likely continue to trend lower at least through the
end of this year.
Real outlays in the fourth quarter for nonresidential
structures jumped nearly 11 percent at an annual rate. Expenditures
rose in a broad array of categories, with the largest increase for
"other commercial" buildings, which consists mainly of retail
stores. In contrast, office construction has yet to rebound from
the precipitous decline of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Looking
ahead, construction permits, which grew at a steady pace over the
first three quarters of 1993, continued to rise in November and
December, and are consistent with continued growth in structures
investment in the near term.
Rotary drilling rigs in use jumped significantly over the first
three quarters of last year but were about unchanged in the fourth
6. Before seasonal adjustment, sales have been flat since March;
consequently, the month-to-month swings in these sales on a
seasonally adjusted basis have been governed by movements in the
seasonal factors.

quarter. Despite the relatively low price for crude oil now
prevailing, most industry analysts expect increasing demand for
natural gas, both from consumers and utilities, to boost exploration
activity in 1994.
The Commerce Department's fall survey of capital spending
plans, taken in October and November, indicated that firms expect to
increase nominal outlays for plants and equipment 5-1/2 percent in
1994.7 If realized, this increase would be a deceleration from
the 7 percent rise now anticipated for 1993. However, spending
plans are often revised significantly over the course of the year:
for the fall survey, the mean absolute error between the predicted
and actual yearly change in plant and equipment spending is about
2-1/2 percentage points. The survey taken in the autumn of 1992,
for example, anticipated a 5-1/4 percent increase in 1993 plant and
equipment spending, almost 2 percentage points less than the latest
reading for that year.
Housing Markets
Housing activity strengthened substantially in the fourth
quarter. Total housing starts jumped 6-1/4 percent in December to
1.54 million units, their highest level since January 1990.
Issuance of building permits also recorded a strong gain late last
year. For 1993 as a whole, starts increased 7 percent to the
highest annual total in four years.
In the single-family sector, starts rose 3.5 percent in
December to 1.33 million units. The strength of single-family home
construction late last year was consistent with the improved demand
7. Although plans for plant and equipment (P&E) spending often
are used to forecast BFI, the two series are independent measures of
capital outlays. P&E spending is estimated from survey data on
capital spending plans; in contrast, BFI is estimated, in large
part, from monthly data on shipments of capital goods and
construction put in place. In addition, the two series differ in
the breadth of expenditures covered; for example, investment by the
farm sector is included in BFI but not in the P&E data.

for new homes, whose sales jumped more than 11 percent in November
to 807,000 units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Existing
home sales also rose during the fourth quarter, ending the year at
the highest level in the twenty-five-year history of this
8series.
The January readings from surveys of households and home
builders suggest that single-family housing activity is likely to be
maintained at the elevated December pace. Consumer attitudes toward
homebuying in January were only fractionally below the series high
recorded in December (chart, upper panel). Similarly, the home
builders' rating of new home sales edged down in January but was
still at a high level (middle panel). The index of applications for
mortgages to finance a home purchase spurted in late December but
dropped back in the first three weeks of January (lower panel).
Nonetheless, the severe weather in January likely disrupted
construction temporarily. Data for the first three weeks of the
month showed temperatures running well below normal in the Midwest
and the East; in addition, precipitation was above normal in these
areas. Empirical relationships indicate that deviations of this
sort from seasonal norms tend to have a negative, albeit transitory,
effect on home construction. Indeed, a number of anecdotal reports
indicate that construction activity was significantly reduced in
some parts of the country.
Reports from the National Association of Home Builders and the
Beige Book have cited price increases for some building materials
and shortages of skilled construction labor as factors that could
8. Some analysts have interpreted the further strengthening of
home sales in recent months as a temporary response by home buyers
to an uptick in mortgage rates in November and December. They argue
that some buyers accelerate their commitment to a home purchase when
they see mortgage rates rise for fear of losing the opportunity to
lock in a relatively low rate. However, an examination of the
response of new home sales to rate upturns since the early 1980s
provides little evidence that an upturn in rates spurs home sales.

exert upward pressure on home prices. Indeed, lumber prices rose
from a low of $218 per thousand board feet last July to $464 per
thousand in late December, before receding to $370 in the week ended
January 28 (c-hart, upper panel). The recent runup appears to
reflect growing demand for wood products both for construction and
for other uses, such as shipping containers and palettes.
Uncertainty about the amount of timber that will be permitted to be
harvested from federally owned land in the Northwest has also been a
factor. The increase in the mill priceof lumber from July to the
present, if sustained, could add as much as $2,400, or about
2 percent, to the average cost of a new home.9 This price
increase would have the same effect on monthly payments as an
increase of about 20 basis points in the interest rate on a thirty-
year, fixed-rate mortgage. Prices of some other building materials,
including gypsum products (mainly wallboard), also have been
trending higher, but these increases have been moderate relative to
those seen for lumber. On the other hand, the plywood price has
changed little, on net, during the past year.
Reports of shortages of construction workers have cropped up in
some locales where building has been especially strong. At the
national level, however, such shortages are difficult to confirm.
Employment of construction workers (excluding supervisors) by
residential contractors has not changed much during the past year,
and it is still low relative to the levels seen in the late 1980s
(chart, upper panel). Employment of skilled workers in special
trades has increased more noticeably, but it also remains low
compared with levels seen a few years ago.10 Regarding labor

Hourly wages for workers in special trades did accelerate last year,
but the rate of increase has remained moderate.
Inventories
For the most part, business inventories remained fairly well
aligned with sales through November, the most recent month for which
data have been published. However, some retail businesses, notably
general merchandise stores, experienced inventory runups amid weak
sales last fall.11
In manufacturing, inventories were little changed in November
after three months of drawdowns. With brisk gains in shipments, the
inventory-shipments ratio for most manufacturing industries fell
further in November, from levels already low by historical
standards.
In the trade sector, merchant wholesalers' inventories rose
moderately in November after little change in the preceding two
months. About half of the November stockbuilding was in farm
products, and the further runup in grain prices in that month likely
explains much of the accumulation (at current cost). On balance,
the inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale sector has been
virtually unchanged since May.
In contrast to the moderate accumulations in manufacturing and
wholesale stocks, retail inventories expanded substantially toward
the end of last year. Excluding auto dealers, retail inventory
investment in September, October, and November averaged $25 billion
at an annual rate, well above the increases of $4 billion to
$7 billion in the preceding four months. Retailers may have allowed
that buildup to occur in anticipation of robust holiday sales. At

outlets for furniture, appliances, and home furnishings, sales were
brisk through year-end. In contrast, the large runup of general
merchandise stocks in November accompanied a decline in sales; the
inventory-sales ratio rose sharply for the first time since March of
last year, when blizzards and extremely cold weather in many parts
of the country reduced store traffic. According to the advance
report, general merchandise sales fell a bit further in December,
and the inventory-sales ratio for stores in this category may have
remained relatively high at year-end.
Federal Government
Real federal purchases fell an an annual rate of 4-1/4 percent
in the fourth quarter, pushed down by declines in both defense and
nondefense outlays. Over the four quarters of 1993, total real
federal purchases dropped almost 6-1/2 percent, the largest annual
decline since the early 1970s.
Turning to the unified accounts, the federal budget deficit for
the October-December quarter of FY1994 was $92.1 billion, down from
the $120.5 billion deficit recorded during the same period in
FY1993. Excluding outlays for deposit insurance, the drop in the
deficit was even larger, from $128.3 billion in the fall quarter of
FY1993 to $92.3 billion in the same quarter of FY1994. However,
these comparisons exaggerate the decline in the underlying deficit.
In particular, Social Security payments of $24 billion were pushed
forward from January 1993 into December 1992 because the January
payment date fell on a holiday. This timing shift boosted the
deficit in the fall quarter of FY1993. No such timing shift
occurred this year.2
12. As discussed below, the quarterly pattern of tax receipts has
also been distorted since late 1992. However, these timing shifts
appear to have had a much smaller effect on the change in the
deficit between the first quarters of FY1993 and FY1994 than did the
shift of Social Security payments.

II-34
Excluding the shift in Social Security payment dates, as well
as expenditures for deposit insurance, unified outlays rose only
2.7 percent in nominal terms between the fall quarter of FY1993 and
the same quarter of FY1994. The small size of this increase
reflects spending restraint across most categories other than the
major transfer programs (Social Security, other income security, and
health-related programs). After accounting for the shift in payment
dates, Social Security outlays rose about 5 percent from a year
earlier, and other income security payments increased nearly 6
percent. The growth in health-related outlays picked up late last
year after several quarters of moderation, and the 15 percent
increase over the year ended in the fall quarter of FY1994 was not
appreciably below the growth rates experienced from 1990 through
1992.
Receipts for the fall quarter of FY1994 were strong, running
8.3 percent above the year-earlier level. Roughly 30 percent of
this increase represents a jump in corporate tax payments, which
have been boosted by robust corporate profits and by provisions in
the 1993 Budget Act that raised the effective corporate tax rate
13last year.13 Among other revenue sources, withholdings for
personal income and social insurance taxes rose 6 percent in the
fall quarter of FY1994 from the artificially high level of a year
earlier. At the end of 1992, withheld tax payments jumped because
individuals shifted taxable income into December in anticipation of
tax increases on 1993 income. The ceiling on the wage base for
Medicare taxes was removed at the beginning of 1994, providing an
incentive for high-income taxpayers to shift wages and salaries (but
not capital income) into late 1993. The substantial rise in
13. These provisions include the rise in the maximum corporate tax
rate from 34 percent to 35 percent and an acceleration in the
required payments on the corporation's tax liability for the year.

1. The projections assume that revenues and outlays for major benefit
programs evolve according to laws in effect at the time the projections are
made, and that appropriations through FY1998 for other programs are
consistent with the discretionary spending caps. The projections include
Social Security and the Postal Service, which are off-budget.

II-36
withholdings from the year-ago level suggests that such shifting may
have occurred again. Preliminary data on nonwithheld taxes in
January, which reflect mainly final estimated payments on 1993
14income, are also consistent with some degree of income shifting.1
In its recently released Budget Outlook, the CBO reduced its
estimate of the FY1994 deficit to $223 billion from last September's
estimate of $253 billion. This reduction stems from economic growth
slightly higher than expected earlier, as well as from changes in
some technical assumptions. Looking further ahead. CBO now projects
the deficit to be about $170 billion in both FY1995 and FY1996, a
figure about $25 billion below that projected last September.
Statements from the administration indicate that OMB's deficit
projections (to be released by February 7) will be similar to CBO's.
In response to the California earthquake, the administration
has proposed additional outlays of $7-1/2 billion, most of which
would be spent by the end of FY1995. About $1 billion would be
financed by already-enacted contingency funds. The remaining
$6-1/2 billion would be designated as emergency funds, which would
not require offsetting changes in outlays or revenues.
State and Local Governments
Real purchases by state and local governments rose at an annual
rate of 1-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, well below the average
5 percent rate of advance in the preceding two quarters. The
slowdown was concentrated in construction spending, which increased
at a 1-3/4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter after rising at
a double-digit pace in both of the preceding quarters. Highway
construction had been quite strong, reflecting in part a burst of
spending in the Midwest following the floods last summer; however,
14. However, BEA's estimate of personal income for the fourth
quarter did not incorporate an adjustment for income shifting.
Following their usual practice, BEA concluded that evidence from tax
receipts alone was not sufficient to warrant such an adjustment.

preliminary data and anecdotal reports indicate that the flood-
related highway repairs were largely completed by November.
Construction of educational facilities, which also rose rapidly in
the second and third quarters, appears to have decelerated in the
fourth quarter. Meanwhile, state and local purchases excluding
construction outlays increased at about a 1-1/2 percent annual rate
in the fourth quarter, similar to the pace at which these outlays
moved up over the preceding year.
According to a recent survey of FY1994 developments conducted
by the National Conference of State Legislatures, general fund
revenues in most states were at or above target for the fiscal year
so far, owing both to conservative revenue forecasts when budgets
were drawn up and to improving economic conditions. The survey also
indicated that many states expect expenditures to come in close to
budgeted levels. However, other states continued to report overruns
in spending on Medicaid, AFDC, and corrections, which could prompt
midyear actions to bolster their fiscal positions. At this point,
however, these actions appear likely to be less widespread than they
were last year, when a total of thirty-seven states either cut
spending or raised taxes or did both, after the start of the fiscal
year.
Prices
The GDP fixed-weight price index, the most comprehensive
measure of inflation for domestically produced goods and services,
rose at an annual rate of only 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter.
However, a few identifiable transitory factors held down the fourth-
quarter increase. First, declining energy prices directly reduced
the price indexes for personal consumption and government purchases.
In addition, the price index for defense purchases was reduced by
the smaller number of early-retirement buyouts accepted in the

fourth quarter by civilian employees. Finally, the indexes for
residential investment and government purchases were lowered by an
unusual drop in the CPI for home maintenance and repair, which is
used to measure price changes for renovation and repair activity in
both sectors. The fourth-quarter rise in the implicit price
deflator, only 1.4 percent at an annual rate, was held down by all
these factors and by a jump in purchases of computing equipment.
The resulting shift in the compositon of GDP toward computing
equipment, which has a particularly low deflator, reduces the
aggregate deflator for GDP but not the GDP fixed-weight index.
Consumer price increases picked up a little in the closing
months of 1993 after having been quite subdued during the summer.
The broad trends continued to point in a mildly disinflationary
direction. Over the twelve months of 1993, CPI increases--
2.7 percent for the overall index and 3.2 percent excluding food and
energy--were a shade below those in 1992. However, prices for some
industrial materials have firmed with the recent surge in activity.
At the retail level, food prices rose again in December, mainly
reflecting another very sharp increase in fruit and vegetable
prices. For the year as a whole, food prices were up 2.9 percent.
Because surges in fruit and vegetable prices are usually short
lived, the recent runup in these prices will likely be reversed in
coming months. However, upward pressures may emerge elsewhere. At
the commodity level, spot and futures prices of farm products have
moved up further in recent weeks in response to another round of
downward revisions to estimated 1993 production; these increases
probably will be filtering through to retail prices over the next
few months. In addition, stocks of several commodities--most
notably, corn--are unusually low, which may lead to more volatility
than usual in spot commodity markets in coming months.

Energy prices at the consumer level fell 1.1 percent in
December, reflecting mainly continued passthrough of last autumn's
decline in the world price of crude oil. However, oil prices began
to turn up in mid-December, and the cold weather in mid-January
pushed up spot prices of both heating oil and natural gas. This
firming in spot prices points to increases in energy prices at the
consumer level in the coming months.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI moved up 0.3 percent in
December, after a similar increase a month earlier. Among nonfood
nonenergy goods, consumer prices rose only 1.6 percent during 1993,
nearly a full percentage point less than the 1992 increase. Tobacco
prices--which declined 6 percent in 1993--fully accounted for this
deceleration. Apparel prices fell in December and rose less than
1 percent over the year; these prices have been held down, in part,
by the effect of the strong dollar on import prices.
Unlike goods prices, service price inflation picked up a bit
last year. Rent of shelter (which constitutes more than a third of
the CPI excluding food and energy) rose 3 percent over the year, a
bit above the 1992 increase. Airline fares increased 17 percent
last year, with the surviving carriers boosting ticket prices to
stem their losses. The sharp decline in auto finance charges also
slowed in 1993. Nevertheless, some service industries showed
significant decelerations from 1992. The twelve-month change in
prices of medical care services declined a full percentage point
last year, although it still is running at nearly double the core
rate of inflation. Tuition increases slowed more than a percentage
point.
Surveys of consumer price expectations have come down in recent
months. The Michigan survey's year-ahead inflation expectation,
which averaged 4-3/4 percent last summer, has declined substantially

of late, to an average of about 3-1/2 percent over the three months
ended in January. The Conference Board survey also showed
expectations declining, although less dramatically, from 4-3/4
percent last -summer to 4-1/4 percent over the three months ended in
January.
Turning to producer prices, recent data generally have
continued to show moderate increases, especially for finished goods,
despite strong gains in output. The PPI for finished goods edged
down in December to a level that was essentially unchanged from a
year earlier. Excluding food and energy, the PPI rose 0.2 percent
in December and was up 1/2 percent over the year. New light
vehicles accounted for more than half of this December increase,
rising 0.6 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis. Over the past
twelve months, new car prices increased 3.3 percent, and light truck
prices rose 4.2 percent. Producer prices of most capital goods
other than motor vehicles increased less than 2 percent last year.
At earlier stages of processing, the index for intermediate
goods excluding food and energy was up 0.2 percent in December,
bringing the increase over the year to 1-1/2 percent. The December
increase in this index was concentrated in materials for durable
manufacturing, especially metals, and for construction materials.
The index for crude materials other than food and energy was up
2.4 percent in December after a 1.7 percent increase in November;
the recent runup in metals prices also accounted for a good part of
this increase.
Commodity prices have increased, on balance, since the last
Greenbook. The Journal of Commerce index of industrial prices (in
which metals have a substantial weight) has increased in recent
weeks, though its current level is about 3 percent less than a year
earlier. As noted above, farm commodity prices have continued to

rise in recent weeks, with the largest increases for corn and
cotton. Crude oil prices turned up in mid-December after their
sizable declines last autumn, and spot prices of gasoline and fuel
oil have shot up during the past month. In contrast, lumber prices
have receded during the past few weeks after a substantial runup
during the second half of last year. In addition, precious metals
prices have edged off after their sizable gains in December.
Labor Costs
The rate of increase in labor costs held steady in late 1993.
As measured by the employment cost index, hourly compensation for
private industry workers increased at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 3.4 percent in the quarter ended December 1993, the same as
the previous quarter's pace. For the year ended in December, hourly
compensation increased 3.6 percent, virtually unchanged from the
rise in the preceding year. Wages and salaries rose 3.1 percent in
1993, up from the 2.6 percent increase recorded in 1992, while
benefit costs increased 5 percent, a bit below the 5.2 percent rise
in the preceding year.
By industry, compensation in manufacturing accelerated about
1/4 percentage point last year to 4.1 percent, as larger gains for
workers at producers of durable goods more than offset smaller
increases in nondurables. Compensation growth also slowed in
construction, with the 2.4 percent rise last year almost a full
percentage point below that in 1992. In the service-producing
sector, compensation growth picked up last year, largely reflecting
a jump in commissions for workers in finance, insurance, and real
estate. Elsewhere in the service-producing sector, compensation
growth generally held steady or slowed. Hourly compensation in the
state and local government sector increased 2.8 percent last year.

Among the components of benefit costs, employer expenditures
for health insurance continued to decelerate, posting a 6.9 percent
rise in 1993 after an 8.6 percent increase in 1992. Spending for
workers' compensation, which also reflects underlying health care
costs, decelerated even more sharply. For most other components of
benefit costs, the increases in 1993 differed relatively little from
those in 1992. However, employer contributions for state
unemployment insurance rose almost 16 percent in 1993, likely
because of higher experience ratings and further increases in state
UI tax rates.
According to the ECI, hourly compensation for workers in
unionized jobs held steady last year at 4.3 percent, compared with
the 3.4 percent rise for nonunion workers. The difference reflects
the more rapid growth in benefit costs for unionized workers: wages
for both groups increased about 3 percent last year. Separate data
on major collective bargaining settlements paint a similar picture
for union wages. The total effective wage change of unionized
workers was 3 percent in 1993. virtually the same as the rise in
1992.
The contribution of COLAs to the effective wage change dropped
in 1993 for the third straight year. Last year. only 24 percent of
the workers covered by major agreements had any form of COLA, down
from 28 percent in 1992 and a peak of 61 percent in 1977. For those
workers still covered by COLAs, the COLA-related wage increases were
considerably smaller, on average, in 1993 than in 1992; indeed, the
small rise in the CPI last year failed to trigger any COLA
adjustment for 25 percent of workers eligible to receive one, up
from 14 percent in 1992.
Although the effective wage change for union workers
decelerated only slightly last year, the first-year wage adjustment

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates on Treasury securities have declined since the
December FOMC meeting. Market participants have generally pushed
back the expected timing of an anticipated modest firming of Federal
Reserve policy, often citing a lack of clear signs of a pickup in
inflation and a view that it will take such indications to prompt
System action. Spreads on corporate bonds, especially high-yield
bonds, narrowed significantly; inflows to junk bond mutual funds
strengthened in December and January. A slowdown in refinancing
activity helped to tighten spreads on fixed-rate home loans in both
the primary and secondary markets.
Stock prices moved to higher ground in response to reports of
economic strength and, in some cases, better-than-expected fourth-
quarter earnings reports. All major indexes posted record highs,
but prices of cyclically sensitive stocks were especially strong, as
seen in the increase of more than 4-3/4 percent in the Dow Jones
Industrial index.
Growth in M2 and M3 moderated in December from the relatively
brisk November pace. In January, M2 growth remained near its
December rate. while that of M3 slowed still further. M2 and M3
finished 1993 somewhat above the lower bounds of their annual
ranges. (The monetary data reflect annual benchmark adjustments and
revised seasonal factors; these revised data are confidential until
publication, scheduled for early February.)
Net borrowing by the domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated
to have strengthened in the fourth quarter, partly in reflection of
a sharp jump in borrowing by the federal sector. In addition, debt
growth in the household sector continued strong, propelled in part
by a stronger housing market and robust auto sales. Businesses also

were more active borrowers, although the overall level of their
borrowing remained weak. Finally, state and local governments
raised a bit more funds in credit markets, but debt growth in this
sector should subside in coming quarters as the boom in advance
refundings has nearly run its course.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 growth declined to an average 2 percent in December and
January. December's slowdown in M2 was owing primarily to a
slackening in Ml growth as the expansion of demand deposits fell off
sharply. Despite a rebound in demand deposits in January, M1 growth
decelerated further, in part because introduced a
deposit product that sweeps excess funds from customers' NOW
accounts into MMDAs. While this product boosted savings deposits, a
heavier runoff of small time deposits left the nontransactions
component of M2 unchanged.
M2 increased 1-1/2 percent over 1993, and its velocity posted
sharp growth for the second consecutive year, rising about
3-3/4 percent over the year (chart). The velocity increase
coincided with a rise in the traditional measure of M2 opportunity
cost as banks continued to reduce deposit interest rates even as
money-market rates stabilized. Nevertheless, M2 remained weak
relative to historical relationships with income and opportunity
costs. The sluggish growth in M2 again was most apparent in
"household M2" (M2 excluding demand deposits and overnight RPs and
Eurodollars), which has been flat for almost three years (chart).
M3 growth moderated to a 3 percent pace in December, bringing
its increase to 1/2 percent over the year. The aggregate
decelerated further in January, despite an increase in large time
deposits, which expanded at the most rapid rate since last spring.
Sizable runoffs of other components served to slow M3 on balance.

Bank credit grew at a 5-3/4 percent rate in December, and
preliminary data suggest a somewhat slower expansion in January.
The securities component advanced strongly in December, as
acquisitions of Treasury and agency securities surged, but it slowed
in January even though the other securities component was boosted by
a change in accounting rules.1 The expansion of other securities
at large banks also reflected another increase in holdings of
municipal securities. Municipal securities began to expand at banks
nationwide in the second quarter of 1993. after six years of
contraction induced by the 1986 tax code revision that eliminated
the deduction of interest expense for all but small-sized tax-exempt
securities. According to responses to the January Senior Loan
Officer Opinion Survey, the new holdings of municipal securities
consist primarily of the small tax-favored issues, although some of
the growth also reflected standard tax-exempt instruments.
Loan growth was held down in December and January as security
loans contracted sharply, reversing some of their very rapid
2expansion over most of 1993. Growth of business loans surged in
January, with strength evident at large and small domestic banks and
especially at foreign banks. Responses to the Senior Loan Officer
Opinion Survey indicated a further pickup in business loan demand
among all sizes of customers. The strength was attributed to
increased inventory accumulation and capital expenditures. Surveyed
1. New accounting rules for off-balance-sheet items such as
swaps and options, the cash value of which must be reported on the
balance sheet, increased the other securities component of bank
credit in early January. Beginning this year, Financial Accounting
Standards Board rules limit the ability of banks to net off-balance-
sheet items for reporting purposes. One of the on-balance-sheet
items affected is other trading account assets, a component of
other securities.
2. According to respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion
Survey, the surge in security loans in 1993 was related primarily to
increased funding needs of dealers, although a few banks indicated
dealers had shifted their funding from other sources, in part owing
to an easing of terms on this type of credit.

banks also indicated they had further eased underwriting standards
and lending terms in the three months ending with January.
Real estate loans, which were boosted in December by a
substantial acquisition of thrift assets, were flat in January.
Consumer loans continued to expand briskly in both months. The
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated a significant increase
in the demand for consumer installment loans and more modest
increases in the demand for home equity loans and residential
mortgages for the purpose of purchasing a home. A number of banks
reported increased willingness to make consumer loans, and a few
banks eased standards for residential mortgages.
Bank profits continued strong in the fourth quarter of 1993,
according to a number of recently released earnings reports.
Although net interest margins appeared to have narrowed a bit, lower
loan-loss provisions boosted profits at many banks. A few large
banks also reported strong trading profits. At some banks, profits
were bolstered by a pickup in loan growth and higher fee income.
Bank stock prices are up nearly 2 percent since the December FOMC
meeting, and spreads on bank bonds narrowed 5 to 10 basis points in
January.
Corporate Securities Market
Available data suggest that short- and intermediate-term credit
raised by nonfinancial firms slowed toward the end of 1993, with
both business loans at banks and nonfinancial commercial paper
falling in December. In January, however, preliminary data suggest
that the runoff in commercial paper eased and that business loans
increased substantially. Finance company business loans rose at an
annual rate of more than 2-1/2 percent in November, the most recent
month for which data are available. Finance company lending has

been the most robust element of the short- and intermediate-term
credit aggregates since mid-summer, with the strength concentrated
primarily in leasing and equipment loans.
Pressures in the commercial paper market diminished
significantly as December 31 approached, with the premium for
funding into the new year falling to the unusually low range of 100
to 150 basis points (earlier in the quarter, the premium had been
between 300 and 400 basis points). Many -issuers apparently
shortened maturities in December to fund just through year-end, as
the average maturity of outstanding paper declined over the month
from forty days to thirty-one days. Since year-end, issuers have
begun to lengthen maturities, and the average by late January had
risen to thirty-eight days.
Gross public issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations
picked up in December and January but remained below the intense
pace seen earlier in 1993. Junk bond issuance has remained strong
at about $1 billion a week, on average, as quality spreads continued
to narrow throughout December and into January. Demand for below-
investment-grade issues has been driven primarily by strong flows
into junk bond mutual funds, which firmed some in December from an
already high level in November and reportedly picked up more steam
in January.3
Corporate bond ratings improved markedly in the fourth quarter,
based on Moody's ratings. Industrial corporations recorded more
upgrades than downgrades for the first time since Moody's began
tabulating quarterly figures by sector seven years ago. During the
past few years, most changes in ratings of investment-grade
industrial firms have been downward, but last quarter the positive
3. Inflows to bond and stock mutual funds soared in December to a
record $31 billion. However, after adjusting for reinvestment of
year-end dividend distributions, inflows were $20 billion, in line
with the average of previous months in 1993.

III-10
ratings actions for these firms were as numerous as the negative
actions, while the ratings of speculative-grade industrials also
improved. Downgrades of nonfinancial firms still outnumbered
upgrades, however, because of weakness in the utilities sector.
Moody's and S&P have expressed concern about recent unfavorable
actions by electric utility regulators, generally slow growth in
demand for services of electric and telephone utilities, and
increased competition facing the electric and telephone utilities as
their industries are deregulated.
Moody's also noted that positive dividend actions have been
occurring with greater frequency, and in November, the latest month
for which Moody's data are available, the number of dividend cuts
and omissions dropped sharply. November registered the highest
monthly ratio of positive to negative dividend actions since
September 1989.
Gross public issuance of equity by nonfinancial firms slowed in
January from the record pace in the final quarter of 1993. In
December, issuance totaled more than $5-1/2 billion, buoyed by
$3-1/2 billion of IPOs, the highest monthly volume for the year.
The slower start in the new year is unlikely to persist, as many
issues are reported in the wings. Despite record gross equity
issuance in the fourth quarter, net equity issuance fell $2 billion
from the $30 billion annual pace in the third quarter, the decline
reflecting retirements arising from Merck's acquisition of Medco.
Merger activity involving share retirements has been increasing
steadily over the last several quarters--for example, the proposed
acquisition of Paramount is expected to reduce net equity issuance
by more than $20 billion at an annual rate this quarter.

III-11
Several highly rated mutual life insurance companies increased
their capital levels by privately issuing surplus notes on the Rule-
144A market just before the end of the year. A surplus note is an
unsecured debt security that has principal and interest payments
linked to the insurer's reported capital surplus. The note is
subordinated to all present and future indebtedness, and the
insurance commissioner in the issuer's state of domicile must
approve all payments to bondholders. Thus, for these mutual
insurance companies, issuance of the notes essentially mimics a
public equity offering. The primary motivation for the recent batch
of issues has been a desire to boost ratios of risk-adjusted
capital, which insurers are required to report for the first time in
their 1993 statutory statements of financial condition.
Major stock indexes rose between 3 percent and 5 percent over
the intermeeting period, responding to incoming signs of greater
economic strength and generally favorable profit reports. Most of
the major indexes are at or just below record levels set in late
January. Utilities' stock prices, however, slumped 1-1/2 percent
over the intermeeting period. The S&P price-earnings ratio has
edged up to 23-1/4 since the last FOMC meeting, still somewhat below
its record high of 26.1 reached in May 1992.
Municipal Securities Market
Gross issuance of long-term, tax-exempt securities fell off in
January to an estimated $16-1/2 billion, down from a robust
$24-1/2 billion in December. December's issuance helped to make
1993 a record year: Gross offerings totaled $280 billion, a 30
percent increase over the volume in 1992, the previous high. The
surge in 1993 was attributable to refinancing activity, as state and
local governmental units took advantage of the lowest bond rates in
twenty years to issue a record volume of refunding bonds. In

III-12
contrast, bond issuance for raising new capital tumbled nearly 25
percent. For the third year running, New York City was the largest
single issuer, and California issuers topped the list for the
largest volume by state.

advance refundings.
Most analysts and market participants expect the volume of
long-term offerings to fall substantially in 1994 as a result of a
slowing of refinancing activity: Outstanding issues can be refunded
no more than twice in advance of their call; and, with the decline
in interest rates over the past three years, most issues that would
benefit from another refunding have already been advance-refunded to
their limit.
In 1993, for the first time since 1986, S&P upgraded more tax-
exempt issuers than it downgraded, albeit by a slim margin. During
the fourth quarter, upgrades outpaced downgrades by a five-to-one
margin. General obligation issues improved the most last year,

III-13
which S&P attributed to the favorable effects of the economic
expansion and to efforts by state and local governments to curb
spending. The municipal utility sector also showed improvement,
marking the third straight year in which upgrades exceeded
downgrades. S&P noted that electric utilities in this sector have
adjusted much better to competitive pressures than have their
counterparts in the private sector. Credit quality continued to
deteriorate among housing and health care issuers. Looking forward,
S&P officials feel that overall credit quality this year is more
likely to remain stable rather than to improve, as many governments
face pressure to boost spending on welfare and corrections while
others must contend with depressed revenues associated with cutbacks
in defense spending.
In the aftermath of the Los Angeles earthquake, the rating
agencies have begun to review the financial condition of issuers
located in the affected areas. Based on preliminary information,
rating agency officials do not expect widespread downgrades; they
point to the availability of disaster relief funds from federal,
state, and local agencies to help cushion the blow. In addition,
most issuers in the area appear to have adequate reserve funds to
withstand any adverse affects. Dealers report that trading in
securities of California issuers has been light since the earthquake
and that some yields have backed up about 5 to 15 basis points. In
addition, sales of several Los Angeles area issues scheduled for
January were postponed to allow time for damage assessment and
disclosure to potential investors.
4. The only source of concern appears to be certificates of
participation, which are debt obligations serviced by lease payments
from municipalities to the owners of private structures. The
municipalities have the right to terminate these leases and might
opt to do so if the leased facilities were to become unusable
because of structural damage caused by the earthquake.

On the regulatory front, a group of municipal market
participants, formed at the urging of the chairman of the SEC, has
recommended a number of steps to improve issuer disclosure.
Municipal bond issuers are exempt by law from the reporting
requirements imposed on corporations that issue publicly traded
securities. Although many large and frequent issuers of tax-exempt
securities currently provide ongoing information, the SEC has
indicated that it would like to expand disclosure more generally.
To this end, the group recommended that the SEC permit dealers to
underwrite the debt only of issuers that agree to provide in a
timely manner annual reports and information on significant
developments. The group also recommended that dealers be required
to inform investors in secondary market transactions about whether
the issuer has agreed to make ongoing disclosures and to report
credit ratings of issuers to investors.
Treasury Financing
The staff anticipates that the $80 billion fiscal deficit for
the first quarter will be financed by $46 billion of marketable
borrowing and a drawdown of the cash balance. The Treasury likely
will raise no cash in bills, and coupon auction sizes are expected
to be about unchanged.
With the upcoming midquarter refunding including a thirty-year
bond, the Treasury may choose to reopen the current on-the-run bond
rather than to issue an entirely new bond. The on-the-run and
currently trades about 12 basis points below the yield of the
previously issued bond, down from 27 basis points in early November,
and is close to par.
The Treasury announced in mid-January that it would call an
outstanding bond that has five years to maturity. By replacing the
security with a new five-year issue, the Treasury will be able to

save about 300 basis points on the roughly $960 million of the
security held by private investors. Possible future calls would
have little effect on Treasury borrowing costs because callable
issues represent only a tiny proportion of the par value of
outstanding bonds.
On December 17, the President signed the Government Securities
Reform Act of 1993, which permanently reauthorizes the Treasury's
rule-writing power for the government securities market. Under the
law, all government securities brokers and dealers must provide,
upon request by the SEC, transactions records needed to reconstitute
trading activity. The law also enables the Treasury to prescribe
rules requiring reporting of large positions in when-issued and
recently issued securities, although the Secretary of the Treasury
is directed to be mindful of the burden on the market when writing
these rules. The law mandates that an automated auction system be
in place by the end of 1995.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on conventional thirty-year, fixed-rate
mortgages have declined 20 basis points to 6.97 percent since the
December FOMC meeting. A tightening of secondary market yield
spreads accounted for most of the decline in the primary market
(chart). The narrower spreads reflected partly the slowing of
refinancing rates, which has increased investor confidence that the
most recent wave of refinancings has topped. Rates on adjustable-
rate mortgages declined 4 basis points to 4.16 percent over the
intermeeting period.
As mortgage rates declined last fall to their lowest levels in
twenty years and housing market activity picked up, gross
originations of residential mortgage loans in 1993 are estimated to
have reached a record of $1.04 trillion, surpassing the previous

year's record of $918 billion (table). Originations in 1994 are
expected to fall below 1993's pace, primarily reflecting a slowing
of refinancing activity. Most market estimates place 1994 gross
originations around $800 billion to $850 billion, still a high
level.
Fueled by the record level of loan originations and household
preferences for long-term fixed-rate mortgages, issuance of
mortgage-backed, pass-through securities also set a record in 1993.
Total volume was $666 billion, up 21 percent for the year. Issuance
by GNMA was exceptionally strong, owing to lower refinancing costs
and the elimination at the end of 1992 of higher downpayment
requirements on loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
Available data on mortgage credit for the fourth quarter
suggest that net residential mortgage debt outstanding continued to
expand sharply (chart). Total real estate loans at banks grew
5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, the fastest quarterly pace for
all of 1993. Mortgages held in portfolio by Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac also rose. The Mortgage Bankers Association's index of
applications for loans to purchase homes continued to trend up
through year-end, although it has dropped in recent weeks below its
late-year highs (chart).
In the commercial mortgage sector, interest rates on high-
quality loans with ten-year maturities remain around 7-1/2 to
7-3/4 percent. However, commercial mortgage investment bankers
report that lenders have returned to making these loans at loan-to-
value ratios of 75 percent, compared with more restrictive 65
percent LTVs only six months ago. These sources also report that
some commercial banks have re-entered the commercial mortgage

business and are beginning to offer seven- to ten-year fixed-rate
loans in direct competition with pension funds and insurance
companies.
Consumer Credit
With partial data for December indicating another robust
increase, consumer installment credit is expected to have grown at a
double-digit pace in the fourth quarter of 1993 for the first time
since the third quarter of 1986 (table). Data through November
suggest that installment credit likely grew 11-1/2 percent in the
fourth quarter and 6-1/4 percent for the year as a whole, which
contrasts with annual gains of 2 percent or less over the previous
three years.
Revolving credit was the fastest growing component last year,
but auto credit showed renewed vigor and even outstripped the growth
in revolving credit during the fourth quarter. The main factor
underlying the rise in auto credit last year was the revival of
automobile sales. Retail sales at auto dealers, which largely
reflect sales of new and used automobiles, increased about
12-3/4 percent in 1993, with much of the growth occurring in the
fourth quarter.
In addition, sharply lower interest rates on car loans in
recent quarters reduced the incentive for car buyers to use
alternative means of financing their purchases, and falling
delinquency rates on auto loans likely encouraged lenders to book
more auto loans. Rates on 48-month, new-car loans at banks were
reported down to 7-5/8 percent in November, narrowing the gap
between new-car loan rates and those on home equity lines of credit
(chart). In November 1991, the auto loan rate had exceeded the pre-
tax rate on home equity lines by about 150 basis points. Although
little current information is available on leasing terms, the

captive finance companies have reportedly cut back some on their
special lease promotions, so the drop in loan rates has probably
helped to restore some of the comparative appeal of auto loans.
Over the past several years, the use of leasing has increased
substantially as an alternative to auto credit. For example,
according to industry statistics, one in four new passenger cars
delivered to consumers in 1993 was on lease, about double the
proportion in 1986. Moreover, in most years since 1986, leasing
depressed auto credit growth by up to 2 percentage points (table),
except for last year when, with the auto market gaining strength and
with leasing gaining market share, leasing may have shaved about
4 percentage points off the growth rate of auto loans. Adjusted for
leasing, auto credit would have grown 12 percent last year rather
than 8 percent.
Auto credit also has been damped somewhat in recent years by
the use of home equity loans, which have increased in popularity
since the mid-1980s. Outstanding debt against home equity lines of
credit is estimated to have grown by as much as $100 billion between
1986 and the end of 1993, although only a small part of that amount
seems to have substituted for auto credit. In various surveys of
households, by far the largest uses cited for home equity loans have
been outlays for home improvements; automobile purchases have
generally been further down the list of uses, with about 5 to
20 percent of households with credit lines having purchased a car by
that means at any time. The use of home equity lines of credit
declined in the second half of 1993, reducing the negative effect on
the growth rate of auto credit.

Merchandise Trade
In November, the merchandise trade deficit was $10.2 billion
(seasonally adjusted, Census basis), about the same as in each of
the previous four months. Exports remained at the high level
recorded in October and imports declined somewhat. For October-
November combined, both exports and imports were well above
third-quarter levels. While the two-month deficit was not
significantly different from what was recorded in either the second
or third quarters, the deficit for 1993 (11 months at an annual
rate) was the largest recorded since 1987. Data for December will
be released on February 17.

Exports rose 5-1/2 percent in October-November from the third
quarter, but declines earlier in the year meant that the level of
exports was only 4 percent higher than a year earlier with most of
the increase going largely to Canada and developing countries in
Asia (especially Malaysia and Thailand). The increase in October-

November was largely in exported machinery, automotive products,
aircraft, and gold. Two-thirds of the rise in exported machinery
was in telecommunications equipment and semiconductors; since the
fourth quarter of the previous year, exports of these items expanded
20 percent. The value of exported computers was about the same in
October-November as in the third quarter (and also a year earlier).
Unusually strong quarter-to-quarter swings have characterized
exports (and imports) of automotive products since last spring, with
an unusually sharp increase recorded in October-November. While
aircraft exports jumped up in October-November, declines earlier in
the year meant that the level of shipments was about 15 percent less
than a year earlier.
Imports rose 4-1/2 percent from the third quarter to October-
November; when combined with increases recorded earlier in the year,
the level of imports was 10 percent higher than in the fourth
quarter a year earlier. Most of the rise in October-November, and
throughout the year, was in imported machinery, automotive products,
and consumer goods. The value of imported machinery jumped 7
percent between the third quarter and October-November: about half
of the increase was oil-field equipment and another 20 percent of
the rise was semiconductors. The value of imported computers
accounted for only about 15 percent of the increase in machinery in
October-November.
Oil Imports.
Most of the decline in the value of oil imports in November
resulted from a drop in price. For October-November relative to the
third quarter, there was little change in the value of oil imports,
as lower prices were offset by higher quantities, which boosted
domestic stocks. For December, preliminary data from the

IV-4
Department of Energy indicate that there was an easing in import
volume (perhaps to a rate below 8.5 mb/d) as stocks were worked off.

After falling for almost the entire second half of 1993, the
near term West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract has moved unevenly
in the $14-$15 range in January. Most recently, the near-term
contract price has moved near $15.50 per barrel as inventories have
fallen in the face of frigid weather. Prospects for an emergency
OPEC meeting in early February appear to have diminished, while
crude oil demand remains dormant and non-OPEC production continues
strong. Oil import prices have mirrored the decline in futures
prices. The price of oil imports in December is estimated to have
been near $12.75 per barrel, with January's price likely to fall
further to just above $12.00 per barrel.
Prices of Exports and Non-oil Imports
Prices of U.S. non-petroleum imports rose 0.1 percent in
December, as increases in prices of foods, automotive products, and
industrial supplies were about offset by declines in prices of
capital goods and consumer goods. For the fourth quarter on
average, prices of non-oil imports rose 2 percent at an annual rate,
the third consecutive quarterly price rise for non-oil imports: the
largest increases were for prices of passenger cars (a new model
year began in October) and foods.

Prices of U.S. agricultural exports in December rose sharply
for the second consecutive month, bringing the increase in the
fourth quarter to 8.2 percent at an annual rate: the largest
increase was reported for feedstuff. Nonagricultural export prices
held steady in December, as in November; for the fourth quarter on
average, nonagricultural export prices declined less than 1 percent
at an annual rate, about half the rate of decline recorded in the
third quarter.
U.S. International financial Transactions
Recorded capital flows for November were characterized by
large inflows from both official and private sources, the latter
through purchases of U.S. securities. Net inflows through banks
declined markedly in November. Outflows through the U.S. purchase
of foreign securities declined somewhat, but were still substantial.
Foreign official assets in the United States rose more than
$12 billion in November after declining slightly in October (line 1
of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions Table). Of the
$7-3/4 billion inflow from G-10 countries (line l.a), $3 billion is
attributable to Germany. German dollar reserves rose after French
authorities sold francs for dollars in the market and used the
proceeds to repay loans made during the ERM crisis. Other large
increases in November were recorded by the BIS and Singapore, the
latter a result of the partial privatization of Singapore Telecom.
Partially offsetting these inflows in November was a $3-1/2 billion
decline in Mexican reserves in the United States. Mexican
authorities intervened to support the peso in the early days of
November after prospects for the NAFTA took a temporary dip.
Partial data for December, from the FRBNY, record further official
inflows on the order of $6 billion. The BIS and Spain account for
much of this inflow.

In the first eleven months of 1993 foreign official reserves
in the United States increased by almost $60 billion. This increase
is roughly $20 billion larger than that recorded in all of 1992.
Japan's reserves in the United States increased by $23 billion in
1993. compared with a decrease of $2 billion in 1992. This increase
in Japan's reserves coincided in magnitude and timing with that
country's exchange market intervention in support of the yen.
Private capital inflows through securities transactions
increased sharply in November to $20 billion (line 4). The increase
was concentrated in foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities
(line 4.a). Over half of the Treasury purchases were attributed to
Japan and the Netherlands Antilles. These purchases may reflect the
normal activity of dealers in response to the large issuance in the
month rather than an increase in demand by their customers.
Singapore residents also acquired more than $1-1/4 billion in
Treasuries in November.
Net foreign purchases of other bonds, especially agency bonds,
remained strong in November (line 4.b), as Japan, the United
Kingdom, offshore financial centers, and Singapore recorded
significant net purchases. Foreign purchases of U.S. equities
remained brisk (line 4.c). The United Kingdom, Japan, and offshore
financial centers accounted for the net purchases.
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities slowed to $7 billion
in November. Although substantial, this was significantly less than
the $11 billion average monthly pace recorded earlier in the year.
Net bond purchases dropped to near zero in November as sales in
Japan and the offshore financial centers offset purchases in
Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Hong Kong. Net purchases
of stocks in November were slightly above their earlier pace with

flows to Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Japan accounting
for most of the net purchases.
Private inflows through banking slowed considerably in
November from nearly $17 billion in October (line 3). Most of the
inflow recorded for November reflects better reporting of loans made
by the offshore offices of foreign-based banks to U.S. non-banks
(from a new Call Report supplement), rather than a capital inflow.
Partial data on transactions with related-foreign offices for
December indicate a small inflow, on a monthly average basis (line 1
of the International Banking Data Table).
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average foreign exchange value of the dollar,
shown in the chart, was unchanged on balance during the intermeeting
period. The dollar rose 1-1/4 percent on balance against the mark,
but declined 1-3/4 percent on balance against the yen and 1-1/2
percent against the Canadian dollar.
The dollar rose against the mark during the first half of the
period on the release of favorable data on U.S. real economic
activity in December, and on hopes that the Bundesbank would allow
its two-week RP rates to decline below the fixed rate of 6.0 percent
that the Bundesbank has maintained since December 8. On January 20,
the Bundesbank disappointed market participants by announcing that
the RP rate will stay fixed at 6.0 percent for the next two weekly
tenders. This caused the market to revise upward the expected path
of future short-term German interest rates and contributed to the
mark's appreciation towards the end of the period. As shown in the
table, between December 21 and January 27. the expected path of
German three-month interest rates, as reflected in three-month Euro-
mark futures rates, rose approximately 10 to 35 basis points through
December 1994. Over the same period three-month spot Euro-mark

IV-11
rates declined 20 basis points and the bellwether bond yield rose 5
basis points.
The dollar's fluctuations against the yen were driven by
changing expectations for Bank of Japan easing, political
developments within Japan, and trade frictions between Japan and the
United States. In the last half of December, the dollar appreciated
against the yen in anticipation of an imminent cut in the Bank of
Japan's official discount rate. However, as it became apparent that
the Bank of Japan did not intend to cut rates immediately, the
dollar began to depreciate against the yen.
On Friday January 21 Japan's upper house of parliament
defeated Prime Minister Hosokawa's political reform package. If a
compromise political reform package is not passed by January 29,
Prime Minister Hosokawa has threatened to resign and call new
elections. The political uncertainty created by these events
boosted the dollar against the yen on January 21 and the following
Monday. The Nikkei 225 Index also responded to the political
uncertainty by declining sharply on Monday. A secondary factor
supporting the dollar at the time was the belief that the defeat of
political reform could substantially delay passage of additional
government fiscal stimulus, thus increasing the impetus for Bank of
Japan easing.
At the end of the period the yen rose on statements by U.S.
government officials that were interpreted to imply that if efforts
to reduce Japan's trade surplus fail, then reducing Japan's trade
surplus would require a strengthening of the yen. Shortly before
greenbook part II went to press, wire reports indicated that Prime
Minister Hosokawa and the Liberal Democratic Party had agreed on a
compromise political reform package for consideration by the

parliament. Market participants apparently interpreted this news as
providing Prime Minister Hosokawa with leeway to make concessions in
trade talks with the United States; this helped the dollar rebound
against the yen at the end of the period.
Interest rate developments in Japan are consistent with market
disappointment over the Bank of Japan's failure to cut the official
discount rate in January. Three-month Euro-yen futures rates, shown
in the table, have risen about 30 to 45 basis points through
December 1994. Three-month spot Euro-yen rates finished the period
about unchanged on balance while the bellwether bond yield rose 35
basis points.
The Canadian dollar's rise during the intermeeting period
occurred in part on reduced uncertainty over the course of Canadian
monetary policy. In the weeks prior to the beginning of the period,
the Canadian dollar had declined on worries that the new Prime
Minister would replace John Crow as governor of the Bank of Canada.
When it was announced that governor Crow would be replaced by Gordon
Thiessen, and that the new government would continue to pursue a
policy of low inflation, the Canadian dollar rebounded.
In Europe. most currencies appreciated against the mark during
the intermeeting period. For countries within the ERM. this
appreciation occurred as these countries refrained from utilizing
the scope to ease monetary policy provided by the widening of the
exchange rate bands in August. The three-month interest rate spread
between France and Germany was about unchanged during the period;
while the spread between Spain and Belgium vis-a-vis Germany
narrowed 5 and 40 basis points respectively. Sterling appreciated
against the mark on additional data suggesting that the economic
recovery in the United Kingdom is well established. The hesitance
of U.K. monetary authorities to ease rates further also contributed

IV-14
to sterling's rise. During the period, the differential between
U.K. and German three-month interest rates rose 20 basis points.
In equity markets during the intermeeting period, the Nikkei
Index appreciated 8 percent on balance. Stock prices rose in most
other major markets during the period with the exception of Germany,
where prices declined about 1.75 percent.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries
appears to have diverged further in the fourth quarter. In Japan,
most indicators are weaker, suggesting a slowdown or possible
downturn in the fourth quarter, after positive real GDP growth in
the third quarter. Data for western Germany and France suggest that
real economic activity was flat or declined in the fourth quarter,
after recording positive growth in the previous two quarters. In
Italy, real GDP fell in the third quarter, offsetting most of
second-quarter gains. In contrast, moderate economic growth
recorded recently in Canada and the United Kingdom appears to have
continued. Unemployment rates in most major foreign industrial
countries edged up in the fourth quarter, but they declined slightly
in the United Kingdom and Canada. Inflation was little changed in
the last months of the year.
On January 27, the new Monetary Policy Council of the Bank of
France, authorized by recent legislation granting independence to
the Bank of France, announced a new monetary target. In December,
the Bank of Canada announced that Senior Deputy Governor Gordon
Thiessen will become Governor when John Crow's term expires on
January 31.

IV-15
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, the economy appears to
have weakened on balance in the fourth quarter of 1993 following a
2.0 percent increase in real GDP (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter.
Moderate gains in industrial production, housing starts, machinery
orders, and new car registrations in November only partially offset
much larger declines in October, while industrial production and new
car registrations slid further in December. The index of leading
indicators edged up slightly in November, but remained well below
its boom/bust demarcation line of 50. Labor market conditions
deteriorated further, as the unemployment rate (s.a.) rose to 2.9
percent in December, the highest since June 1987.
Consumer price inflation in the Tokyo area (n.s.a.) increased
somewhat to 1.4 percent on a 12-month basis in January, reflecting
higher fresh food prices. Appreciation of the yen contributed to a
continued decline in wholesale prices, which in December were 3.3
percent below their year-earlier level.

October; the cumulative surplus for the first eleven months of 1993
was $130 billion (a.r.), up from $117 billion for 1992 as a whole.
On January 21, Prime Minister Hosokawa's political reform
package, which had been passed by the lower house of the Diet in
November, was defeated in the upper house, clouding prospects for
the Hosokawa government and its plans to implement economic stimulus
policies. On January 28, an apparent compromise on the reform
package was reached with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party,
improving prospects for the formulation of economic stimulus
measures -- including an income tax cut and a third supplemental
budget for the 1993 fiscal year -- that had been postponed, pending
passage of the political reforms. However, no firm timetable for
implementation of the stimulus measures has been set.
Real economic activity faltered in western Germany in the
fourth quarter after two quarters of positive growth. Industrial
production (s.a.) fell in both October and November. The average
level of industrial production in the two months was 1 percent below
the third-quarter average and 4.5 percent below the year-earlier
level. Bad weather in November reduced construction output, but
weakness was pervasive in most industrial sectors. The volume of
retail sales fell sharply in October and November, as did the volume
of new orders for west German manufactured goods. Preliminary
government estimates indicate that total German GDP contracted 1.3
percent in 1993. West German real GDP is estimated to have fallen
1.9 percent. In December, unemployment (s.a.) was unchanged from
November at 9 percent of the dependent labor force (excluding the
self-employed) in western Germany, while the unemployment rate
(n.s.a.) in eastern Germany rose to 15.4 percent.

In October, industrial production (n.s.a.. excluding
construction) surged in eastern Germany and was 11.2 percent above
its level in October 1992. while construction output was up 24.6
percent. Manufacturing output was up 10.1 percent (year/year) in
October, led by increases in capital and consumer goods. East
German real GDP is estimated to have expanded 6.3 percent in 1993.
Despite significant increases in administrative prices and
taxes at the beginning of the year, preliminary estimates indicate
that the 12-month increase in consumer prices (n.s.a.) was 3.4
percent in January, down from 3.7 percent in December. Moderation
of input prices has helped lower consumer price inflation.
Wholesale prices (n.s.a.) were up 0.1 percent on a year/year basis.
West German import prices (n.s.a.) edged down in December, and were
1.0 percent below their December 1992 level. The first agreements
in the 1994 wage round have been quite moderate. In January, the
roughly 700,000 employees in the chemical industry accepted a 2
percent pay increase, a freeze in bonus payments, and a flexible
work week.
Consumer prices (n.s.a.) in eastern Germany were unchanged in
December, and the 12-month rate of inflation was 8.7 percent, down
slightly from the rate registered for the previous five months, and
well below the average rate of 11.2 percent in 1992.

IV-21
In November, M3 registered growth of 7.2 percent (s.a.a.r) over
the average of the fourth quarter of 1992, somewhat above its target
range of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. On December 16, the Bundesbank set
the 1994 target for M3 growth at 4-6 percent.
According to preliminary figures, the pan-German current
account deficit (n.s.a.) in the first eleven months of 1993 was
$20.3 billion, down slightly from the $22.4 billion deficit recorded
in the same period of 1992, reflecting a large increase in the trade
surplus over this period.
French GDP rose 0.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter of
1993, with growth mostly due to continued strength in consumption.
Recent monthly indicators point to a weaker fourth quarter on
balance. On the expenditure side, consumption of manufactured
products (s.a.) was flat in December but fell 2.3 percent in the
fourth quarter. Industrial production (s.a.) rose 0.6 percent in
November, reversing an October decline. The unemployment rate
(s.a.) stabilized at 12 percent in November. A December survey by
INSEE. the French statistics institute, showed further improvement
in business confidence.
Inflationary pressures remain subdued. The consumer price
index in December was 2.1 percent (n.s.a.) above its year-earlier
level. Inflation is likely to rise slightly in January with
scheduled increases in excise taxes. This good inflation
performance has been supported by continued moderate wage growth.
The October wage survey showed that hourly wages in the third
quarter were 2.8 percent (n.s.a.) above their year-earlier level,
the same as the increase registered in the July survey.
The French trade balance continued to record large surpluses.
The cumulative surplus registered over the first 11 months of 1993

IV-22
was $14.0 billion, roughly triple the surplus for the same period a
year earlier.
On January 7, the Monetary Policy Council of the Bank of France
held its first meeting after its members were announced. The
Council will meet twice a month on the Thursdays when the Bundesbank
Council does not meet. The nine-member Monetary Policy Council is
composed of the Governor of the Bank of France, his two deputies,
and six independent members with diverse professional backgrounds.
Following a meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on January 27,
Governor Trichet announced that the Bank would target M3 growth of
around 5 percent over a four year period. Trichet explained that an
annual target range was not set because M3 growth is likely to
continue to be highly unstable. He also reaffirmed the Bank's goal
of keeping the French franc at a level close to its central ERM
parity.
The United Kingdom's modest recovery appears to have continued
into the fourth quarter. Preliminary estimates indicate real GDP
accelerated 2.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter on the
strength of oil production. Non-oil production increased at the
same rate as in the third quarter. The unemployment rate (s.a.)
edged down further to 9.8 percent in December, and the Purchasing
Managers' Index registered a sharp increase in new orders. In
January, indicators of consumer and business confidence picked up.
In December, consumer prices (n.s.a.) were 1.9 percent above
year-earlier levels; excluding mortgage interest rates, consumer
price inflation was 2.7 percent on a 12-month basis. Producers'
input prices in December were lower than a year earlier. Pressures
from labor costs have moderated further over the last year. In
November, the underlying rate of inflation in earnings remained at 3

IV-23
percent, the lowest rate in over 25 years, it was down from 5
percent in November 1992.
In October, the trade deficit (s.a.) improved considerably to
$868 million from $1.7 billion in September. The cumulative deficit
for the first ten months of 1993 was $15.4 billion, down from $18.5
billion in the same period last year.
Economic activity in Italy remains weak. Real GDP fell 1.9
percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, as domestic-demand dropped
3.3 percent. More recent indicators are mixed. Industrial
production in October edged up from September's level but remained
flat compared with the third-quarter average. The unemployment rate
(n.s.a.) rose sharply in the fourth quarter to 14.3 percent, its
highest level since unemployment statistics were first reported in
1959. Real retail sales remain flat. On the brighter side.
consumer and business confidence are strengthening from depressed
levels and the outlook for prospective orders is improving.
Despite depreciation of the lira that occurred in the wake of
Italy's exit from the ERM in September 1992, weakness in economic
activity has restrained inflation. The CPI inflation rate (Q4/Q4
basis) in 1993 was 4.1 percent, the lowest rate in 24 years.
The low lira and weak economic activity continue to contribute
to improvement in Italy's external accounts. Another trade surplus.
the ninth in 10 months, was registered in October, bringing the
trade surplus for the year to $17.6 billion (s.a.). During the same
period in 1992, Italy recorded a $8.9 billion trade deficit. The
current account has experienced a similar dramatic turnaround.
On December 22, Parliament approved the 1994 budget in which
fiscal consolidation will continue. If the target is met, the
deficit as a percent of GDP will drop 1 percentage point from its
expected 1993 outturn to 8.7 percent.

IV-24
On January 16, President Scalfaro dissolved Parliament but
rejected the resignation of Prime Minister Ciampi. who will continue
in office until new parliamentary elections are held March 27-28.
Recent economic indicators for Canada suggest continued
moderate economic growth in the fourth quarter. The index of
composite leading indicators strengthened in November and December.
Real GDP at factor cost (s.a.) rose 0.1 percent in October, as an
increase in service sector output offset a slight-decline in
industrial production. After a large increase in October, the
merchandise trade surplus narrowed in November. The unemployment
rate (s.a.) edged up in December to 11.2 percent, largely from an
increase in the labor force. The average unemployment rate for the
fourth quarter was 11.1 percent, down from 11.4 percent in the third
quarter and 11.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Continued slack in the labor market held down average wage
settlements for the first three quarters of the year to 0.6 percent,
well below the 2.1 percent average in 1992. Slower growth in labor
income combined with increases in productivity contributed to a 0.4
percent decline in unit labor costs for the 12 months ending in the
third quarter, the first year-over-year decline since 1962. This
also represented an improvement in unit labor costs relative to the
United States.
Inflation remains modest. The 12-month increase in the
consumer price index (n.s.a.) was 1.7 percent in December, below the
Bank of Canada's inflation target. The December 12-month increase in
the industrial product price index was 3.1 percent.
On December 23. the Bank of Canada announced that Senior Deputy
Governor Gordon Thiessen will take over as Governor when John Crow's
term expires on January 31. The Bank and the Minster of Finance
issued a joint statement on the objectives of monetary policy,

IV-25
including an extension of the inflation targets through 1998 with a
1 to 3 percent range.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
Civil unrest and political transitions have generated economic
uncertainty in several of the major developing countries. An armed
rebellion temporarily disturbed financial markets in Mexico, while
violent demonstrations generated pressure for higher social spending
in Argentina. New political scandals and the launch of election
campaigns diminished the near-term prospects for significant
monetary and fiscal reforms in Brazil. Several key market-oriented
ministers resigned from the Russian government, causing a plunge in
the ruble due to market expectations of rising inflation.
In China, retail sales and urban prices accelerated sharply in
December. On January 1. the Chinese authorities unified the
exchange rate system, thereby eliminating a large implicit subsidy
to state enterprises. In Taiwan, economic activity has been boosted
recently by higher exports to the United States. In Korea, capital
inflows and temporary liquidity injections by the central bank have
produced a small surge in inflation.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, the cumulative trade
deficit for the first eleven months of 1993 was $12.3 billion, about
$2 billion less than in the same period of 1992. Exports grew by 12
percent, while imports rose by 5.4 percent. Over the same period,
Mexico's bilateral trade deficit with the United States fell to $700
million (at annual rates), from $4.9 billion in 1992.
In the first three quarters of 1993, the current account
deficit narrowed by $1 billion relative to the same period of 1992.
while the capital account surplus widened by $3.6 billion. Falling
interest rates and rising stock prices indicate that capital inflows
have accelerated in the wake of ratification of NAFTA by the U.S.

IV-26
Congress. At the auction of January 26, the twenty-eight day
Treasury-bill rate was 10.48 percent, 236 basis points lower than in
late November. The Mexico City stock index rose steadily until
early January, when an armed uprising in the southern state of
Chiapas temporarily depressed the stock market. Stock prices
recovered after the government adopted a conciliatory stance toward
the rebels. On January 27, the stock index reached an all-time
high, more than 25 percent above -its level in late November.
Consumer prices in December were 8 percent higher than a year
earlier, the lowest annual increase in 22 years. The exchange rate
has remained steady since late November.
In Brazil, growth in industrial output slowed to 8 percent in
November (year-over-year), down from a recent peak of 17 percent in
March. Brazil recorded a trade surplus of $13.1 billion in 1993,
down from a surplus of $15.3 billion in 1992. Export growth of 8.1
percent was outpaced by import growth of 25 percent, due to strong
internal demand and a real appreciation of the cruzeiro.
In December, creditors holding over 95 percent of Brazil's
foreign bank debt agreed to the terms of the $35 billion
restructuring package. As a result, Brazil made a payment of $160
million on its interest arrears. Substantial uncertainty remains
about the prospects for an agreement with the IMF, which would
facilitate the implementation of the debt restructuring package by
the April 15 deadline. Congress is presently considering budgetary
cuts proposed by Finance Minister Cardoso in December. However, in
the wake of new political scandals and the launching of campaigns
for general elections in late 1994, the Brazilian government appears
unlikely to enact significant fiscal and monetary reforms this year.
Reflecting the current political impasse, Brazil continues to
experience high and rising inflation. Consumer prices rose 37.7

IV-27
percent in December, up from November's inflation rate of 36
percent. At the end of 1993, consumer prices were more than 2,500
percent higher than a year earlier.
In Argentina, the cumulative trade deficit through October was
$1.3 billion, up slightly from $1.1 billion over the same period of
1992. Exports grew by 7.2 percent over this period, spurred by
higher automobile and oil shipments to Brazil, while imports rose by
7.7 percent. The consumer price index was unchanged in December,
and stood 7.4 percent higher than a year earlier.
The semi-annual household survey reported unemployment at 9.3
percent in October, down from 9.9 percent in May, but still much
higher than the 6.6 percent rate of October 1992. Provincial
governments have been forced to slash payrolls in recent months
under a new fiscal arrangement with the federal government. These
payroll reductions, combined with a generally weak labor market.
contributed to the outbreak of violent demonstrations in two rural
provinces in mid-December.
In late December, the Menem administration announced a package
of payroll tax reductions to stimulate the labor market and enhance
Argentina's external competitiveness. The current payroll tax rate
of 33 percent (including pension, health, and unemployment
insurance) will be reduced to less than 10 percent in the poorest
rural provinces and to about 22 percent in the wealthiest urban
provinces. The recent civil unrest has also generated pressure to
improve the social safety net. However, under the final year of its
IMF program, the government has agreed to target the primary fiscal
surplus at 2 percent of GDP in 1994. up from 1.7 percent in 1993.
Thus, the authorities are working to increase the efficiency rather
than the volume of social welfare expenditures.

China's economy is estimated to have grown by 13 percent in
1993, almost the same pace as in 1992. Urban prices rose by 19.6
percent in 1993, up from 10.9 percent in 1992. Boosted by panic
buying, retail sales in December were up 30 percent from the
previous month, and were 35 percent higher than in December 1992.
The government has announced its intention to restrain growth to
less than 10 percent this year, with a tighter rein on inflation,
but such plans have routinely been contravened in the recent -past.
The Chinese authorities unified the official and swap market
exchange rates on January 1, thereby eliminating a 33 percent
implicit import subsidy. Since many state enterprises depend
heavily on imported inputs such as energy, the unified exchange
rates will intensify competitive pressures on these enterprises.
The spot market exchange rate has remained steady at about 8.7 yuan
per dollar since last autumn, despite the ongoing rise in inflation.
The Chinese government resolved a dispute with the United
States over textiles transshipment by agreeing to slow Chinese
deliveries under textile quotas. The government also released two
prominent Tibetan political prisoners and agreed to permit prison
inspections, as U.S. officials have publicly questioned whether lack
of Chinese progress on human rights issues will prevent President
Clinton from renewing China's MFN status in June. Secretary
Bentsen's recent visit to China focussed on encouraging the Chinese
authorities to pursue policies that will yield stable and
sustainable growth and to maintain open markets for goods and
services.
Taiwan's GNP grew by 6 percent in 1993, down slightly from 6.5
percent in 1992. Weak exports and lower infrastructure spending
contributed to the growth slowdown, but economic activity has been
boosted recently by higher exports to the United States. The

IV-29
merchandise trade surplus shrank to $7.9 billion in 1993, its lowest
level in ten years, as exports grew by 4 percent and imports grew by
7 percent. Consumer prices rose by 2.9 percent during 1993.
In Korea, strong capital inflows from abroad coupled with
large-scale injections of liquidity by the central bank have
rekindled fears of inflation. Consumer prices in December were 5.8
percent higher than a year earlier, up from 4.6 percent in
September. Meanwhile, the composite stock price index has risen by
more than 20 percent since June. The Seoul bourse received $5.7
billion in foreign funds in 1993, with most of the inflow occurring
in the last four months of the year.
Merchandise exports through the first 11 months of 1993 were
7.3 percent higher than in the same period of 1992, while imports
were only 1.6 percent higher. The current account deficit through
November 1993 narrowed to $330 million, down from $4.4 billion over
the same period of 1992.
Korea recently announced plans to privatize numerous state-
owned companies and banks over the next five years. The
privatization effort is expected to generate about $8.7 billion in
revenue, which will primarily be directed toward infrastructure
development.
In Russia. a run on the ruble was sparked by the resignations
of Economy Minister Yegor Gaidar, Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov.
and other market-oriented officials. Gaidar and Fyodorov expressed
concern that the government would reverse the economic stabilization
and reform measures enacted last year. The new Economy Minister,
Alexander Shokhin, has stated his support of tight monetary policy
but has also indicated support for higher import tariffs and

IV-30
restrictions to protect the domestic banking industry. Viktor
Gerashchenko is expected to continue as head of the Central Bank of
Russia.
In response to these developments, the ruble plunged from 1247
per dollar on January 1 to 1542 per dollar on January 27, reflecting
fears of market participants that the government would increase its
reliance on money finance. Over the three weeks ending on January
27, the Central Bank of Russia defended the ruble-by injecting about
$1 billion into the exchange market, comprising nearly 25 percent of
its foreign exchange reserves. Monthly inflation declined
significantly to 12 percent in December, but early reports indicate
that inflation has increased substantially in January.
