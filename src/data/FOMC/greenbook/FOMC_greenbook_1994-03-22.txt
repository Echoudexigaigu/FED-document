DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interpretation of the incoming economic data has been
complicated by the severe winter weather and the redesign of the
monthly household labor market survey. Nonetheless, the economy
seems to have retained appreciable forward momentum. The faster
pace of economic activity since last summer has put upward pressure
on prices of some industrial materials; however, productivity growth
has kept unit labor costs subdued, and consumer price inflation has
remained in check.
Labor Market Developments
Despite the negative effects of the severe weather, labor
demand appears to have grown moderately further in early 1994.
After posting sizable gains at the end of 1993, nonfarm payrolls
leveled off in January, with only part of the pause clearly
attributable to severe weather. But payrolls rebounded 217,000 in
February, and employment in the household survey also increased.
The unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage point to 6.5 percent.
Employment in the private service-producing sector, which
flattened out in January, increased 220.000 in February. Hiring in
retail trade rebounded, despite another noticeable drop in jobs at
eating and drinking places. Services employment was up smartly, led
by continued gains in the health industry and an increase in
business services. The transportation, wholesale trade, finance,
and insurance industries also posted sizable job gains.
Manufacturing payrolls increased 12,000 in February, bringing
the total gain since September to about 80,000. Much of the
increase over this five-month period has been in automobile- and
construction-related industries; machinery producers have also been
adding workers. In contrast, construction payrolls, which are

especially vulnerable to weather disruptions, have fallen 40,000
since December.
Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers
have been volatile this year: After jumping 0.3 hour in January,
they plummeted 0.5 hour to 34.3 hours in February. Some decrease in
the workweek last month was to be expected, given its
extraordinarily high level in January, but the drop clearly was
accentuated by the weather.1  Notably, the household survey
indicated a huge rise in the number of full-time workers who
reported part-time hours in February due to bad weather. As a
result of the drop in the workweek, aggregate hours of private
production workers fell 1-1/4 percent.2
After an unexpectedly low reading in January, the unemployment
rate fell 0.2 percentage point in February to 6.5 percent.3
However, the Commissioner of the BLS has stated that the official
figures may be exaggerating the decline in joblessness in early
1994. One reason is that the BLS is using seasonal factors based on
the old series to adjust the current unemployment rates; results
from last year's parallel survey suggest that seasonal movements in
1. The manufacturing workweek also plunged in February after
three months of readings that were among the highest of the post
World War II period. In this case, the drop appears to have been
entirely weather-induced. Indeed, the BLS reported that a number of
factories were forced to shut down temporarily during the survey
week.
2. It is important to note that weather disruptions were more
severe during the February reference week than during the January
reference week. However, looking at the months as a whole (the
observation period for the industrial production data), the
disruptions were more severe in January.
3. An important question is how to evaluate the January and
February readings on unemployment relative to the levels that were
reported late last year using the old CPS. With the introduction of
the new CPS, our working assumption was that the switch to the new
format would add 1/2 percentage point, the average difference in
1993 between the official data and the results of the parallel
survey, to the reported data. However, the 1/2 percentage point
adjustment reflects an average for the year as a whole, which
abstracts from seasonal adjustment difficulties and other factors
associated with the transition to the new survey format.

the old and new unemployment rate series may differ. Our rough
calculations indicate that the unemployment rate may have been
understated 0.1 percentage point in January and, perhaps, 0.2
percentage point in February; this difference will be reversed next
summer when the data for most months will be biased upward.
Other technical factors also may have held down the reported
unemployment rates for early 1994. Notably. most of the individuals
in the January and February samples had experience with the old CPS
format, which may have influenced their responses: A person who had
described herself as "out of the labor force" in the old survey
might still have a tendency to continue to answer the same way--
ignoring any changes in definition in the new survey. In addition,
the percentage of interviews conducted from centralized computer-
assisted telephone facilities so far has been smaller than BLS is
planning for the longer run; in last year's parallel survey,
respondents interviewed by phone from the centralized facilities
appeared to have higher unemployment rates than those interviewed in
the field--either by phone or in person. These factors all are
difficult to quantify, but they suggest that the current
unemployment rate may overstate the degree of labor market
tightness.
Alternative indicators of labor market conditions are
consistent with a moderate increase in employment. Although the
Conference Board's help-wanted index fell back a bit in January, the
reading, which followed a period of steady improvement, may have
been affected by the bad weather. As measured by the Manpower
Index, hiring plans for the second quarter strengthened, bringing
4. One factor that could be working to raise the unemployment
rate slightly in the near term is that BLS cannot immediately apply
composite estimation to the new survey data. This procedure, which
was used with the old CPS, tends to reduce the variance in the
monthly changes in unemployment and to control for rotation group
bias.

the index back up to its year-earlier level. Initial claims for
unemployment insurance, after turning up in January and most of
February, moved back down in recent weeks to levels comparable to
those of last October and early November. During the week ended
March 5, initial claims totaled 352,000.
Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers
rose 0.2 percent in February after surging 0.5 percent in January.
Over the past twelve months, hourly earnings have risen 2.6 percent,
about the same as the increase over the previous twelve-month
period, but in the upper part of the range since mid-1992.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector was revised upward to
show a gain of 6 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter,
bringing the increase over the four quarters of 1993 to nearly 2
percent.
Industrial Production
The index of industrial production rose 1/2 percent per month
in January and February; the index in February stood nearly
2 percent (not at an annual rate) above its fourth-quarter
average. Output of utilities surged in January as cold
temperatures put upward pressure on heating demand, but the less
severe conditions in February contributed to a retracing of about
one-third of the gain. By contrast, manufacturing output picked up
in February as the restraining effects of the bad weather
diminished.
Manufacturing output increased 0.6 percent in February, after a
rise of just 0.2 percent in January. The available evidence
suggests that adverse weather may have lowered the level of factory
5. In creating our estimate of industrial production for
February, we discounted heavily the 1-1/2 percent drop in production
work hours from the BLS payroll survey, mainly because the weather
during the reference week was significantly worse than during the
rest of the month.

output about 1/2 percentage point in January, but significantly less
in February. In particular, output of motor vehicles and steel,
which were clearly restrained by weather in January, increased
notably in February. Other industries, including furniture, stone,
clay, and glass, and apparel, apparently sustained output losses in
both months.
Assemblies of motor vehicles rose to a 13.9 million unit annual
rate in February--the highest level since the late 1970s; the
increase in the output of motor vehicles and parts accounted for
about two-thirds of the increase in total manufacturing output.
Looking ahead, manufacturers' schedules call for sizable reductions
in assemblies of both autos and trucks on a seasonally adjusted
basis in the second quarter. Auto producers raised output in the
first quarter partly to fill orders from rental car companies that
were deferred in the second half of last year and to replenish
dealer stocks: sales to rental fleets are expected to return to more
normal levels in the second quarter. In the case of trucks, the
anticipated reduction in assemblies is entirely a product of the
seasonal adjustment process; manufacturers currently are producing
near capacity and will continue to do so through the spring.

Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output has continued to
advance in recent months, but the gains have been smaller than those
of late 1993--even making allowance for the weather disruptions.
Output of nonauto consumer durable goods, which had risen markedly
in the fourth quarter, has softened considerably, while production
of consumer nondurables, including clothing and other staples, has
been essentially flat for several months. In the area of business
equipment, output of office and computing equipment has remained
very robust, but production of industrial equipment has slackened.
Output of defense and space equipment and of commercial aircraft
fell further in the first two months of 1994. Production of
construction supplies also turned down. likely because of the
weather-induced curtailments in construction, and output of durable
materials slowed after last year's burst.
Factory operating rates have risen to relatively high levels by
historical norms, especially for primary processing industries.
where utilization was at 86 percent in February, about 4 percentage
points above the average level during the previous twenty-five
years. Typically, when operating rates in primary processing
industries become high. prices for intermediate materials firm; in
addition, materials processors may ration deliveries through
nonprice means. So far, inflation in materials has not picked up as
much as the historical relationships would suggest, possibly
reflecting intense domestic and foreign competition, and there are
few reports of suppliers putting customers on allocation. Moreover,
although purchasing managers' reports for January and February
indicated a sharp deterioration in vendor performance, survey
respondents attributed it, in large part, to the severe weather.

II-12
Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending hit a lull in early 1994. This flattening
was attributable at least in part to the bad weather, but may also
reflect a tendency of spending to return to trend after a period of
exceptional increases. Nonetheless, with real disposable personal
income having posted solid gains since the middle of last year and
consumer sentiment holding at a relatively high level, the
underpinnings for consumption growth remain firm.
Retail sales are now estimated to have declined 1-1/2 percent
in nominal terms in January and to have only reversed that drop in
February. Spending at the retail control group, which excludes
sales at automotive dealers and building material and supply stores.
showed a similar pattern: It rose 1.2 percent in February, after
dropping 1.4 percent in the preceding month.6 Within this group,
sales at all types of stores increased in February.

most other types of stores is now estimated to have been
substantially lower.

II-13
By contrast, sales of new light vehicles have been
exceptionally brisk so far this year--averaging 15.4 million units
at an annual rate in January and February. As noted earlier, part
of the uptick in sales represented a surge in fleet purchases by
businesses, which had been restricted by supply difficulties during
the second half of last year (chart).7 But, underlying the high
pace of sales as well are continuing replacement demand by
households and positive car-buying attitudes, as measured by the
Michigan survey. Sales to retail customers, which reportedly were
depressed in January by the California earthquake and severe
weather, increased noticeably in February. bringing the average pace
of such sales for the two months to about the levels seen, on
balance, during the second half of last year.
Purchases of light trucks, which strengthened notably in the
fourth quarter, increased further in January and remained at that
high level in February. Sales of large pickups by the Big Three
domestic producers have been especially vigorous. In addition,
sales of Chrysler minivans, which are being heavily promoted in
anticipation of the introduction of Ford's new minivan, rose sharply
in February. The recent strength in sales has left days' supply of
light trucks at a low level, and although an increase of about
200,000 light trucks (annual rate) from a retooled Canadian plant
should help to ease pressures on supply, stocks almost certainly
will remain tight.
Consumer spending on services grew rapidly in January. Outlays
for energy soared, reflecting the unusually cold temperatures in
many parts of the country; the continuation of colder-than-average
temperatures in February suggests that spending for heating likely
remained high last month. Outlays for personal business services

also were very strong in January, in part because high trading
volumes in the stock and bond markets pushed up outlays for
brokerage and investment counseling services.
Total nominal personal income fell 0.3 percent in January.
However, substantial earthquake-related reductions in rental and
nonfarm proprietors' income and a decline in subsidy payments to
farmers more than accounted for the drop. Nominal wages and
salaries jumped 1.0 percent in January. after rising an average of
0.4 percent per month during the second half of 1993. The
implications of the February labor market data for personal income
are uncertain because BEA typically makes some allowance for
unusually severe weather during the reference week when it
translates the data on hours into wages and salaries.
Housing Markets
Most of the key indicators of housing market activity were down
in January from cyclical highs reached at the end of 1993, and
starts remained at a relatively low level in February. Housing
activity clearly was depressed by weather conditions in the early
months of 1994, but some retreat from the extraordinary levels of
9late 1993 was likely in any event.
Housing starts averaged 1.29 million units at an annual rate in
January and February, compared with a fourth-quarter level of
1.48 million units. The largest declines in January were in the
Northeast and Midwest--the two regions where the weather was most
abnormal. But the weather explanation is only partial: Starts
8. Uninsured losses to residential and business property from
the Northridge earthquake reduced rental income and nonfarm
proprietors' income by $40 billion and $2-1/2 billion, respectively.
9. The Los Angeles earthquake has probably had no significant
effect on housing activity thus far. In 1993, the LA/Long Beach
metropolitan area accounted for less than 1 percent of U.S. housing
starts. Industry sources in Southern California estimate that no
more than a few hundred of the closings scheduled for existing homes
in January were postponed or cancelled because of the earthquake.

rebounded in the Northeast in February despite continuing bad
weather, and permit issuance for the nation as a whole--which
typically is less sensitive than starts to the weather--fell
8 percent in February, after a similar drop in January. Sales of
new homes also plunged in January, while sales of existing homes
were only slightly below the high December level (chart, top panel).
First indications of housing activity in March come from
industry surveys of builders and lenders. Homebuilders' ratings of
current sales edged down for the fourth consecutive month, although
assessments remained nearly as positive as at their peaks in the
mid-1980s. Applications for home purchase loans at mortgage bankers
moved up a bit beginning in late February, but remain below the
volumes seen late last year. Mortgage interest rates have increased
about 50 basis points since mid-February and likely will have some
effect on activity this month.
Overall, house prices have been rising moderately. Constant-
quality price indexes for new and existing homes in the fourth
quarter indicate annual inflation rates in the range of 2 to
4 percent. Transactions prices of new and existing homes sold in
January posted somewhat larger increases, but these monthly measures
are sensitive to changes in the mix of homes sold.
Lumber costs continue to put upward pressure on house prices.
Costs of other materials, including plywood and gypsum products,
have also risen, but by less. Labor supply for construction remains
ample in all but a few booming markets; neither the unemployment
rate for these workers nor wages yet show significant tightening for
the nation overall.
Consumer attitudes toward homebuying. as measured by the
Michigan survey, remain very favorable. Affordability is the
driving force: Three-fourths of respondents cite low interest rates

as the reason that "now is a good time to buy." and "low prices"--
though noted less often than they were a year ago--are the second
most frequent response. In contrast, the investment motive to buy
homes apparently remains very weak.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment rose 22 percent at an annual
rate in the fourth quarter of 1993. the largest quarterly increase
in ten years. The very limited information available for the
current quarter points to a still healthy but noticeably smaller
gain.
On the equipment side, orders and shipments of nondefense
capital goods excluding aircraft retreated in January, after having
moved up sharply late last year. Orders dropped 7 percent, partly
reflecting the retracing of a spike in bookings for railroad
equipment, while shipments dropped 5 percent. Even so, these
declines reversed only part of the runup over the preceding two
months.
Business purchases of motor vehicles remained on a solid
uptrend in early 1994. As mentioned earlier, fleet sales of autos
surged in January and remained at a high level in February. Sales
of heavy trucks were also strong in January and the large backlog of
orders suggests that they will remain so for some time.
In contrast, the news in the aircraft sector is still downbeat.
Domestic outlays for aircraft declined nearly 40 percent in real
terms over the four quarters of 1993 and will likely remain very
weak in 1994. Not only has Boeing cut production substantially, but
a large share of the planes scheduled for completion this year are
slated for foreign deliveries.
On the whole, however, the fundamental determinants of outlays
for equipment other than aircraft are very favorable. Capacity

utilization rates have increased, cash flow remains high, and the
cost of capital continues to decline because of the falling relative
price of capital goods, particularly computers. Sales expectations,
which were likely boosted by the solid growth of business output at
the end of 1993, should continue to buoy equipment spending.
Turning to nonresidential investment, construction put-in-
place, which trended up for most of 1993. fell about 3 percent in
January. Declines were sharpest for office buildings, which had
posted big increases in the preceding two months, and public
utilities, where weather conditions appeared to be a factor. In
addition, permits for private nonresidential buildings fell
15 percent, with sizable decreases registered in all categories
except institutional buildings. Finally, rotary drilling rigs in
use remained roughly at their December level in January.
The news from several recent reports concerning real estate
markets is mixed. According to the Russell-NCREIF index, the
nominal appraised value of income-producing properties in the United
States fell 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993, bringing the
decline over the four quarters of 1993 to 7.4 percent.10 This
reduction, though sizable, actually is considerably smaller than
those reported in 1991 and 1992. As in previous years, office
properties suffered the largest declines in appraised values.
However, the FDIC's latest Survey of Real Estate trends, which
records the assessments of senior examiners and asset managers at
federal banking agencies, was far more positive than the Russell-
NCREIF index: in January, 40 percent of the respondents
characterized the market for commercial real estate as having
improved since last October. Finally. Coldwell Banker reported that
10. The properties covered by this index include apartment
buildings, retail stores, warehouses, office buildings, and mixed-
use buildings that combine office and R&D activities.

the national office vacancy rate was 17.0 percent in the fourth
quarter, down from 18.7 percent at the end of 1992.
Manufacturing and Trade Inventories
Business inventories fell a little, on balance, at the
beginning of 1994, and stocks generally were lean, especially at
manufacturing firms. Excluding auto dealers, manufacturing and
trade stocks declined at nearly a $6 billion annual rate in current-
cost terms in January, after rising less than $10 billion at an
annual rate in the fourth quarter.
Manufacturers' inventories rose at an annual rate of $15.5
billion in January after posting a net decline in the fourth
quarter. Much of the January increase was at producers of
machinery, whose shipments plunged--perhaps in part because of
weather disruptions. Demand for machinery had been very strong in
late 1993, especially for computers and office equipment and
machinery for the service industry, and inventory-shipments ratios
had fallen to extraordinarily low levels. Thus, even with an uptick
in January, the inventory-shipments ratios for these industries
remained low by historical norms.
In the trade sector, inventories posted sizable declines in
current-cost terms at both the wholesale and retail levels. The
decline in retail stocks was a bit surprising in light of the
weakness in sales in January. Stocks at general merchandisers,
which had been on the high side last autumn, dropped sharply between
November and January, and the inventory-sales ratio for these stores
fell to a very low level on a historical basis.
Federal Sector
The unified federal budget deficit for the first four months of
fiscal year 1994 was $76 billion, 16 percent less than for the same
period in fiscal 1993. The improvement was attributable to

of taxes. For the fiscal year to date, corporate income taxes
increased 23 percent over the comparable 1993 period, reflecting
both sizable gains in corporate profits and the speed-up of
corporate tax payments required by the Unemployment Compensation
Amendments of 1992.11 Individual and social insurance taxes were
7 percent higher, boosted in part by the increase in withholding
rates for high-income individuals in January. Excise taxes rose
14 percent, in part because of the hike in the tax on transportation
fuels in October.
The pattern of personal tax receipts around the turn of this
year was similar to that experienced a year earlier. As occurred in
late 1992, personal tax receipts were unusually high in December
1993, suggesting that some high-income taxpayers shifted wage and
salary income forward from January to avoid the higher Medicare
taxes that went into effect this year. January nonwithheld tax
receipts, which include the final quarterly estimated tax payment on
the prior year's tax liability, also were high for a second year.
As in 1993. payments this year were likely boosted by the rules
enacted in 1991, which increased the percentage of their expected
yearly tax liabilities that individuals must pay through withholding
or estimated tax payments. Some of the bulge in January 1993 was
also attributable to income shifting in anticipation of higher taxes
under the then-incoming Clinton Administration, but such shifting
likely was less of a factor this year.
Excluding deposit insurance, outlays have risen only about
2 percent so far this fiscal year. Restrained by the caps on
11. The speedup of tax payments was used to help finance the
extension of emergency unemployment benefits.

discretionary appropriations, defense spending has dropped about
5 percent in nominal terms. With regard to mandatory spending, the
growth in income security programs has continued to slow, in part
because of reductions in outlays for unemployment benefits.
However, health-related spending, up about 11 percent for the
current fiscal year to date, has shown no noticeable deceleration
since the unwinding of the 1990-92 Medicaid bulge. Net interest
payments have remained flat as rising debt levels have about offset
the effects of the downward trend in interest rates.
A supplemental appropriations bill was passed in February that
authorized $11 billion in spending and $1 billion of new loans
mainly for the California earthquake, Somalia peace keeping, and
Midwest floods. Because this spending has been given the emergency
designation, it is not subject to the discretionary spending caps.
The outlays authorized by this legislation will be disbursed over
the next several years with $4 billion and $3 billion allocated to
fiscal years 1994 and 1995 respectively.
On February 7, the Clinton Administration released its budget
for fiscal year 1995. The Administration projects that the unified
budget deficit will be $235 billion in fiscal 1994, drop to $165
billion in fiscal 1995, and then rise slightly through 1998. The
Administration's deficit projections, adjusted for the effects of
the health care reform package and the President's other
initiatives, are quite similar to CBO's.
Some of the projected improvement in the deficit reflects the
Administration's assumption that real GDP will grow at above-
potential rates over the next several years,and that the
unemployment rate will decline to 5.5 percent by 1998 (under the old
survey methodology). The brighter fiscal picture also reflects the
budget restrictions enacted in OBRA93. which set a discretionary

spending cap for each year through 1998 and reaffirmed the pay-as-
you-go (PAYGO) requirements governing mandatory spending and taxes.
The discretionary caps are roughly constant in nominal terms: thus,
real discretionary spending is required to fall at about the rate of
inflation. Under the PAYGO rules, new legislation affecting
mandatory spending and receipts may not increase the deficit in any
year.
The OBRA93 restrictions also appear to have constrained new
policy initiatives by the Administration. Proposed increases in
some training, education, and health programs were limited by the
need to find offsetting cuts in other programs. Although the
Administration has indicated that it will propose welfare reform
later in the year, it has not been included in the budget. The
budget does include the Administration's health reform package,
which is estimated to have little effect on the deficit through
fiscal year 1998 and to generate sizable deficit reduction
thereafter. In contrast. CBO estimates that the health plan would
add to the deficit over this period.
State and Local Government Sector
State and local government purchases appear to be slowing in
the first quarter following three large quarterly advances. Outlays
for construction, which posted a strong advance in the fourth
quarter, dropped sharply in January. At least part of that decline
probably reflected weather-related slowdowns in the East and
Midwest, offset a bit by some earthquake rebuilding in California.
State and local employment grew by 16,000 workers in February,
following a substantially smaller gain in January. The rise so far
this year has been somewhat weaker than the average seen last year.

two months reportedly have extended hours of existing employees and
contracted out to private workers.
While still large on a historical basis, the NIPA deficit of
operating and capital accounts, excluding social insurance funds,
narrowed a bit in the fourth quarter to an estimated $52 billion
(annual rate). This reduction in the deficit is broadly consistent
with survey and anecdotal reports from the states, which are also
suggesting budgetary improvement during the current fiscal year.
Prices
Inflation at the finished goods level has remained subdued
despite the acceleration in economic activity in recent quarters.
In January and February, consumer price increases (both overall and
excluding food and energy) averaged about 0.2 percent per month, a
bit below the average increase of about 0.25 percent per month over
1993. Price increases at the intermediate goods level have also
been small recently. By contrast, prices of crude materials
(excluding food and energy) have continued to rise rapidly, as they
did during much of 1993. Crude material costs represent a
relatively small part of the value of finished goods, however, and
such cost increases alone usually do not directly impart much upward
thrust to finished goods prices.
Retail food prices fell in the first two months of the year.
Prices of fresh fruit and vegetables accounted for the decline,
dropping about 6 percent over the two months following their sizable
runup towards the end of 1993. Excluding fruits and vegetables.
which are extremely volatile on a month-to-month basis, food prices
edged up. At the commodity level, spot and futures prices of major
crops have dropped back somewhat since the last Greenbook, but
stocks of several of these commodities remain unusually low, raising

the prospects for more price volatility than usual in agricultural
markets in coming months.
Energy prices at the consumer level moved up 1.6 percent in
February, reflecting the weather-induced increases in spot prices of
both heating oil and natural gas. Nevertheless, with crude oil
prices remaining low, these weather effects likely will prove to be
transitory. Indeed, by mid-March, the spot prices of gasoline and
fuel oil had moved back down to near their levels at the time of the
last Greenbook.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI increased 0.3 percent in
February. after a rise of only 0.1 percent in January: over the past
twelve months, these prices have increased 2.8 percent. Prices of
nonfood, nonenergy commodities have been especially tame so far this
year. Tobacco prices--which declined 6 percent in 1993--moved down
another 1/2 percentage point in the first two months of this year.
Apparel prices also were down in January and February, but this may
reflect a delay in the seasonal price increases that will be
associated with the introduction of spring and summer merchandise.
However, the CPI for new motor vehicles was up about 1/2 percent in
February, reflecting strong demand in that industry. Among
services, rent of shelter (which accounts for more than a third of
the CPI excluding food and energy) increased about 1/4 percent in
January--its average pace over the past year--but was up about
1/2 percent in February.
Consumers' inflation expectations have continued to edge lower
in the past two months, although they are still running above
inflation measured over the the past year. The Michigan survey
showed the average expected price change for the next twelve months
declining to near 3-1/2 percent in January and February from
3-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter. The median of expectations
from this survey also has moved lower. In the Conference Board

survey, expectations held about unchanged at 4-1/4 percent in
January and February.
The PPI for finished goods rose 0.5 percent in February, after
a 0.2 percent increase in January. However, much of the February
increase owed to a surge in energy prices, especially for gasoline
and heating oil. By contrast, the PPI for food was down in
February. reflecting a plunge in fresh vegetable prices. Excluding
food and energy, the PPI rose 0.1 percent and was up 0.4 percent
over the past twelve months.
Price pressures also remain subdued in the markets for
intermediate materials. The index for intermediate goods excluding
food and energy was unchanged in February. and the increase over the
past twelve months was 1.1 percent. However, the index for crude
materials other than food and energy was up another 2 percent in
February after rising 1-1/2 percent in January and nearly 12 percent
over 1993. The February increase reflected jumps in the price of
raw cotton and of several metals.
Spot commodity prices have increased on balance since the last
Greenbook,despite the easing of farm commodity prices noted above.
Lumber prices, while continuing to exhibit considerable volatility,
are up slightly on net since the week of the last Greenbook. Steel
scrap prices, which had surged in the second half of 1993, have been
unchanged over the past several weeks; however, prices of other
metals have generally increased, and the Journal of Commerce index
of industrial prices-(which is heavily weighted toward metals) is up
about 1-1/2 percent since the last Greenbook. The prices of gold
and other precious metals also have moved higher. In the energy
markets, fuel oil prices surged in early February but have since
fallen back; crude oil prices followed an opposite path, dropping
back somewhat through the first half of February, but rallying a bit
in recent days.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Since the System's action to tighten reserve conditions on
February 4. the federal funds rate has increased 25 basis points to
3-1/4 percent, but other rates have risen by considerably more.
Across the Treasury yield curve, for example, rates have jumped
40 to 60 basis points with the largest increases in the intermediate
maturities. Some of the rise reflects expectations that the Federal
Reserve will raise short-term rates faster than previously thought
and that further tightening is, in fact. imminent. Contributing to
that impression was surprisingly strong year-end 1993 economic data
and evidence of solid economic growth in early 1994 which were seen
as suggesting stronger credit demands and the need for higher
interest rates to contain inflation. Heightened trade tension and
unsettled conditions in financial markets abroad also may have
contributed to the rise in rates. In total, though, not all of the
increase can be explained by fundamentals, suggesting that some
portion may represent the effect of attempts by fund managers to
pare holdings of long-term bonds in the U.S. and abroad as
opportunities to profit from rate declines were seen as having run
their course.
The rise in interest rates contributed to weakness in stock
prices, which have declined on net since early February and are now
2 percent to 3 percent below the highs recorded just before the
February FOMC meeting. Shares of some banks thought to have been
exposed to global weakness in capital markets have fallen by more.
The monetary aggregates weakened in February. M2 contracted at
a 1 percent annual rate: Ml continued to expand at a moderate pace
but declines in the non-M1 components of M2 were widespread. M3
collapsed, falling at a 7-3/4 percent pace as institutional
investors reacted quickly to a widening spread between money market

mutual funds and higher-yielding short-term instruments. Data for
early March for the broad aggregates suggest some rebound at a time
when households appear to be pulling back from longer-term mutual
funds.
It is too soon to tell if the higher interest rates and
unsettled conditions in financial markets are significantly altering
borrowing by the nonfederal sectors. Business borrowing appears to
have tilted toward shorter maturity bonds and bank loans. Issuance
of municipal debt has slowed in response to the backup in interest
rates. Mortgage debt growth may have been affected by the recent
weather-related disruptions to housing activity, although underlying
debt growth of households appears firm.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 declined 1 percent at an annual rate in February, following
increases at about a 2-1/2 percent rate in both December and
January. The Ml component continued to grow moderately in February:
Currency posted another double-digit gain; growth of demand deposits
slowed, reflecting the continued decline in the volume of mortgage
refinancings; and the run-off in other checkable deposits
abated. Outside of Ml, money market funds recorded a
substantial outflow, despite indications that households have
reacted to weakness in capital markets by investing less in bond
funds. Moreover, inflows to saving deposits weakened in February,
perhaps in response to the increase in opportunity costs on such
accounts, while small time deposits continued to decline near the
pace of recent months.
1. The decline in other checkable deposits was accounted for by
the introduction of a product to sweep balances from
other checkable deposits to MMDAs. Because the arrangement was
introduced in mid-January, it affected month-average growth in
February.

M3 contracted at a 7-3/4 percent annual rate in February. In
addition to the weakness in its M2 components, the decline reflects
heavy redemptions of institution-only money funds, whose rates move
more slowly than rates on market instruments. Also, large time
deposits fell sharply, with most of the decline recorded at branches
and agencies of foreign banks; they apparently substituted funds
raised abroad for domestic CDs to support brisk credit growth.
Bank credit expanded at a 5-3/4 percent pace in February, a
little slower than in January but faster than in the fourth
quarter.2 A significant portion of the reported recent
growth--more than 3 percentage points in February--actually reflects
an accounting change, rather than any net additions to loans and
investments. That change, which limits the ability of banks to net
off-balance-sheet items, affected the securities component.3
Overall, holdings of U.S. government securities were little changed
over the month, and large banks actually divested short-term
securities. The unusual weakness in government securities may
reflect the portfolio decisions of managers expecting that interest
rates have hit bottom and that opportunities for additional capital
gains on fixed-income investments have passed. Moreover, since the
beginning of the year, banks have reported their securities "held
for sale" on a marked-to-market basis, and some of the weaker growth
may reflect a decline in security valuations.
2. Bank credit data have been benchmarked back to 1988 using
recent Call Reports. Also, seasonal factors have been reestimated.
and a new method for smoothing through breaks in series has been
implemented.
3. As indicated in the January Greenbook, banks must report the
net cash value of off-balance-sheet items such as swaps and options
on their balance sheets, as other trading account assets (a
component of other securities) or other liabilities. Previously,
banks were permitted to net across counterparties, but FASB has
determined that beginning this year, banks may net gains and losses
only for given customers.
4. FASB115, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1993, was implemented by most banks in January 1994.

Total loan growth at banks strengthened to a 4-3/4 percent pace
in February, owing to a pickup in consumer loans and to a partial
reversal of run-offs in the volatile security loan grouping.
Consumer loans expanded at a 10 percent annual rate in February
following an 8-1/4 percent pace in January. February's increase was
boosted in part by loans made in anticipation of tax refunds.
Moreover, banks recently have chosen to hold consumer loans on their
books rather than securitize them, probably because of more
comfortable capital positions. Real estate loans, in contrast,
declined at a 1-1/4 percent rate in February.
Business loans expanded at a 4-3/4 percent pace in February.
Although growth was off a bit from the 10-1/4 percent spurt in
January. the expansion in business lending thus far this year shows
a marked pickup from 1993 activity. Call Report data for C&I loans
indicate significant further improvement in commercial bank
delinquency and charge-off rates for the fourth quarter (chart):
Delinquency rates fell to yet another record low for the series that
began at the end of 1982. while charge-off rates again moved down
smartly. Delinquencies and charge-offs for real estate and consumer
loans were down to rates last recorded in the late 1980s.
Business Finance
The recent rise in interest rates has been associated with some
changes in corporate financing patterns. Gross issuance of bonds by
nonfinancial corporations, slackened a bit in February and early
March, with several offerings reportedly postponed or canceled, and
issuance activity has been largely confined to short- and
intermediate-term maturities. In February, only six investment-
grade offerings had maturities of thirty-years or longer, compared
with the average of twenty-one per month in 1993 and fourteen in
January.

III-9
Liquidity in the corporate debt markets has deteriorated, and
secondary market activity in all types of bonds has reportedly
dropped off noticeably. Speculative-grade mutual funds reported
outflows in late February and early March, partly reversing several
months of strong gains. Changes in yield spreads between
investment-grade bonds and Treasury securities have been uneven
among sectors. Spreads on most bank bonds widened 10 to 20 basis
points, reflecting concerns about losses on proprietary trading,
while spreads on bonds of regulated telephone companies and
utilities have remained stable or have narrowed slightly. In the
speculative-grade market, yield spreads on new offerings have
increased somewhat.
Increased uncertainty about future interest rates has resulted
in a falloff in the issuance of structured notes. A structured note
is a security that is customized to the specifications of the
investor and has features that reflect an investor's opinion about
the future path of interest rates. At the time of issuance, the
issuer of a structured note typically simultaneously enters into a
swap or other derivative transaction. In 1993, U.S. corporations
issued about $30 billion of these notes, and federal agencies issued
another $55 billion. Recently, as interest rates have become more
volatile, investors have decreased their demand for structured
notes, and dealers have become less willing to underwrite them.
Commercial paper issuance by nonfinancial and financial firms
also has edged off, and maturities have been shortened, in some
cases to overnight. As a result, the average maturity on
outstanding commercial paper declined from thirty-eight days in
early February to thirty-four days in mid-March. Quality spreads
between medium-grade and prime-grade paper have widened a few basis
points.

III-10
After moving to record highs in early February, major stock
price indexes have declined around 3 percent. On February 4, the
day of the tightening, share prices fell more than 2 percent, the
largest one-day decline since 1992. Share prices of utilities,
banks, and other financial firms have posted larger declines than
industrials owing to their greater sensitivity to changes in
interest rates. The price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 (on
trailing twelve-month earnings) continued drifting down, to 21.0 in
March from 23.6 in early February. The all-time high was 26.1 in
May of 1992.
Equity markets were also buffeted by the February 23
cancellation of the Bell Atlantic Corporation, Telecommunications
Inc. (TCI), and Liberty Media Corporation merger, which would have
been one of the largest in U.S. history. The firms cited concerns
about the FCC's decision to order a 7 percent cut in basic cable
rates. But, the steep drop in the price of Bell Atlantic's stock
after the merger was announced was no doubt an important factor.
The failure of the merger has increased the likelihood that
telephone companies will engage in joint ventures with media
companies, rather than acquiring them. In the week after the
cancellation, share prices of regional Bell operation companies rose
3 percent to 4 percent, while share prices of cable companies fell
5 percent to 10 percent. Yield spreads on Bell Atlantic's AA-rated
bonds narrowed 5 to 10 basis points, while spreads on TCI's
BBB-rated bonds widened 20 to 50 basis points. Yield spreads also
widened on bonds of below-investment-grade cable companies, as
investors now view their bonds as less likely to be upgraded as a
result of mergers.
The five-month takeover battle for Paramount Communications
Corporation apparently ended in early February with Viacom Inc.'s

III-11
$9-3/4 billion offer of cash and securities. The deal involved the
retirement of about $6-1/2 billion in equity, which reduced
aggregate net equity issuance in the first quarter. Paramount
shareholders will receive Viacom shares and contingent value rights
that obligate Viacom to guarantee the value of some of those shares.
Despite the decline in the stock market, many nonfinancial
corporations continued efforts to improve their balance sheets by
issuing equity. In February. nonfinancial firms raised $4.4 billion
in new equity, up from $3.4 billion in January but significantly
below the $6.1 billion raised in the fourth quarter of last year.
The volume of initial public offerings totaled nearly $1.5 billion
in February, double January's pace. Information for early March
indicates a further rise in equity issuance.
Nonbank financial intermediaries appear to be better positioned
to supply credit to businesses. The overall health and
profitability of finance companies improved markedly during 1993.
Recent earnings reports of several independent finance companies
have shown gains of 20 percent to 40 percent, and there have been a
number of rating upgrades, most notably for Household International
and Chrysler. The improvement is due to continued wide spreads
earned on credit products, further improvements in credit quality,
and a strengthening in the condition of captives' parent companies.
In January. business receivables of finance companies grew at a
7-3/4 percent annual rate, after running off in the fourth quarter
of last year.
In order to maintain an important conduit for funding and
liquidity, some finance companies have indicated that they will
continue to securitize a steady, though perhaps small, stream of
assets--both wholesale and retail credits. Along those lines, in

risk-based capital ratios evidently look fairly comfortable. A
survey of life insurance companies by the Mortgage Bankers
Association found that those companies seeking investment
opportunities in 1994 have increased their commercial mortgage
lending goals 40 percent over 1993 goals, while other respondents
plan to re-enter that market after an absence of three or four
years.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that the $67 billion first-quarter fiscal
deficit will be financed by $40 billion of marketable borrowing and
by a large drawdown of the Treasury's cash balance. The Treasury is
expected to pay down $8 billion in bills, as $16 billion of cash
management issues are scheduled to mature. The gross size of the
weekly bill auctions was cut from $25.2 billion to $24.4 billion in
the middle of the quarter, but recently the amount was reset to
$25.2 billion. Treasury coupon auctions are expected to raise $48
billion, with gross auction sizes generally little changed from the
previous quarter.
At the February mid-quarter refunding announcement, the
Treasury indicated that it was studying the possibility of issuing
floating-rate five- to seven-year notes indexed to three-month
Treasury bill rates, with rates reset quarterly. Such notes would

III-14
lessen the government's exposure to longer-term interest rates and
reduce the amount of bills that need to be rolled over.
Over the past few months, several dealers have created
synthetic Treasury bonds to meet demands for noncallable securities
having maturities of sixteen to twenty years. A scarcity has arisen
because the existing Treasury bonds maturing between years 2007 and
2014 are callable five years before maturity, and the large drop in
yields since these securities were issued makes it likely that they
will be called by 2009. Dealers have filled the potential void
between the years 2010 and 2014 by buying strips to replicate the
payments of sixteen- to twenty-year bonds and placing them in
custodial accounts as collateral for investors. Yields on these
synthetic securities have been well above those suggested by the
interpolated yield curve.
The market for federal agency debt has been relatively calm
over the past month. Narrow spreads relative to Treasury securities
have generally been maintained, with only a minor widening during
the recent upturn in interest rates.
Municipal Securities
Tax-exempt bond yields have increased relative to Treasury
yields over the intermeeting period, primarily reflecting
significant cutbacks in purchases by municipal bond funds. These
funds reportedly are attempting to build liquidity in anticipation
of any share redemptions that might be prompted by the backup in
interest rates. At the end of January. liquid assets held by
tax-exempt bond funds had dipped below 3 percent of total assets,
the low end of the range prevailing over the past ten years. Market
reports suggest that inflows to these funds slowed in February.
after being exceptionally heavy in January. and that outflows
occurred early in March.

III-15
Longer-term municipal yields have been under the greatest
pressure, as bond funds have been, on balance, net sellers.
Intermediate-term rates have fared somewhat better, partly because
property-casualty insurance companies have continued to buy
securities with maturities ranging from five to fifteen years. In
addition, dealers report that banks and individuals in recent days
have found tax-exempt yields in the shorter end of this range to be
attractive.

The backup in municipal yields contributed to a sharp decrease
in refunding volume in February, and overall gross issuance of
tax-exempt bonds fell to $13 billion last month, well below the
average monthly pace of $24 billion recorded last year. Gross
issuance was slow in the first week of March, and with the
thirty-day calendar remaining light, volume this month likely will
decline further.

III-16
Gross issuance of short-term debt jumped sharply in February.
boosted by a $3.2 billion sale of revenue anticipation warrants by
California. The warrants mature in the fiscal year beginning
July 1. The state's financial prospects have deteriorated further
in recent months, prompting Standard and Poor's to revise its
long-term credit outlook from stable to negative. Although an
action of this sort generally portends a rating downgrade, dealers
bid aggressively in the competitive offering of revenue anticipation
warrants, partly because of heightened investor demand for
liquidity. Yields on California's outstanding bonds were not
affected by S&P's action, as market participants had already built a
premium into interest rates on the state's bonds.
On March 9. the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
released for comment a proposal that would force many issuers of
municipal securities to provide up-to-date financial
information.5 The SEC has no legal authority over municipal
issuers, but it can achieve its disclosure objective by imposing
restrictions on the activities of brokers and dealers in municipal
securities. Thus, the proposal would restrict dealers to
underwriting only those securities of issuers agreeing to provide
periodic financial reports and would require dealers to review the
most recent information before recommending securities to investors
in secondary market transactions.
5. The SEC provided guidance on the appropriate information,
which includes annual financial statements and notices of material
events affecting the issuer's creditworthiness and the terms of the
securities. The proposal would not apply to small issuers, and it
would affect only securities sold after its adoption. Along with
the release of the proposal, the SEC also asked the Congress to
adopt legislation that would require certain issuers of private
activity bonds to register the securities with the SEC and be
subject to the reporting requirements of corporate issuers.

III-17
Mortgage Markers
The Freddie Mac survey of major mortgage lenders indicates that
the average contract rate on conventional fixed-rate mortgages has
increased 66 basis points since the February FOMC meeting, to
7.63 percent. The upward spurt about followed the rise in Treasury
bond rates, and mortgage yield spreads were little changed, on
balance, over the intermeeting period (chart, upper panel). The
rate on fixed-rate mortgages is now nearly 1 percentage point above
its recent low recorded during the week ended October 22 of last
year. The average initial rate on one-year. Treasury-indexed,
adjustable-rate mortgages rose nearly 40 basis points over the
intermeeting period, to 4.51 percent, after posting a record low of
4.12 percent during the week ended February 4 (chart, middle panel).
With higher rates on fixed-rate mortgages and a steeper yield
curve, the Federal Housing Finance Board reported that the
proportion of new loans for home purchases having adjustable
interest rates jumped to 24 percent in December and January from an
average of 18 percent during the five preceding months (chart, lower
panel). Market reports suggest that thrift institutions are eager
to originate ARMs for their portfolios: some thrifts have been
increasing discounts on first-year ARM rates to capture market share
from mortgage companies. The estimated discount on "teaser-rate"
ARMs has increased from about 200 basis points in mid-January to
about 250 basis points in the week ended March 11.
Available information for the fourth quarter shows that home
mortgage credit expanded at an 8-1/2 percent seasonally adjusted
annual rate that quarter, the fastest growth in three and
one-half years. Moreover, both multifamily and commercial mortgage
debt posted small increases, the first rise in about two years.
Limited data for mortgage credit in the current quarter suggest

growth about on par with the fourth quarter's rapid pace. likely in
part reflecting closings on the large volume of mortgage
applications late last year (chart). In the current quarter, the
Mortgage Bankers Association's index of applications for loans to
purchase new and existing homes, has moved down from peaks at the
end of last year, but remains relatively high (chart).
The increase in commercial mortgage debt likely reflects other
favorable developments in the commercial real estate market. For
example, the American Council of Life Insurance reports that
commercial mortgage delinquencies at life insurance companies
(including loans in process of foreclosure) declined to 4.54 percent
at the end of the year. Over the past three quarters, commercial
mortgage delinquencies have dropped more than 2-1/2 percentage
points. Part of the decline can be attributed to asset sales,
securitizations, and an increase in loans in good standing with
restructured terms (a majority of which are reported to have been
done at current market rates). However, participants in the
council's survey, which account for 85 percent of the life insurance
industry's total mortgage holdings, also attributed the sharply
improved credit performance in the fourth quarter to more of their
delinquent loans having been paid off or brought current, suggesting
improved cash flow from commercial properties and an increased
ability and willingness among borrowers to put more equity into
their properties.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit dropped off a bit in
January from its strong fourth-quarter pace. largely reflecting
weaker auto credit growth. In contrast, revolving credit
accelerated and the "other" installment category continued to grow
rapidly, although well below its December pace. Total credit

(installment plus noninstallment) advanced at an 8-3/4 percent rate
in January, following an 11-1/2 percent pace in December.
Interest rates on consumer loans at commercial banks edged down
further between surveys taken in the first week of November and the
first week of February. The average "most common" rate on credit
card plans declined another 1/4 percentage point, to just over
16 percent--the lowest level since this series began in early 1972.
Rates on forty-eight month new car loans edged down to a series low
of 7-1/2 percent. At finance companies, the average rate on loans
for new cars dropped almost 1-1/2 percentage points between November
and January, reflecting a sales campaign by GM that offered loans at
a 2.9 percent rate for some models.
Gross public issuance of securities backed by consumer loans
surged to a record $44 billion in 1993. far surpassing the previous
high of $37 billion in 1991. Industry sources expect 1994 to be
another strong year for new issues: in part. this reflects an
increase in the volume of outstanding credit card securities
scheduled to mature in 1994 and likely to be "rolled over" in the
form of new securitizations. Robust auto sales in 1994 also are
expected to generate substantial new issuance during the year.
Despite the larger volume of gross issuance of securitized consumer
credit, the ratio of securitized assets to total installment credit
outstanding has remained near 15 percent since late 1992.

Merchandise Trade
In December, the merchandise trade deficit was $7.4 billion
(seasonally adjusted, Census basis), the smallest deficit since
December 1992. Exports rose sharply (about half of which reflected
a bunching of deliveries of aircraft) and imports declined somewhat.
Decreases in imported oil, consumer goods, and vehicles from Canada
were not fully offset by increased imports of capital goods, other
industrial supplies, and automotive products from countries other
than Canada. Data for January will be released on March 22.

increases in exported machinery were in computers, telecommunica-
tions equipment, and semiconductors. Strong shipments of oilseeds
and meat and poultry accounted for most of the increase in
agricultural exports. Exports to Western Europe and developing
countries in Asia showed the largest increases from the third to
fourth quarters.
Imports rose 3 percent in the fourth quarter; the largest
increases were in capital equipment (computers, semiconductors, and
oil drilling equipment) and consumer goods. Cars and parts from
countries other than Canada and industrial supplies (particularly
building materials) also registered gains in the fourth quarter. By
area, non-oil imports from Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and Mexico
strengthened noticeably.
Oil Imports
Both the price and quantity of imported oil fell in December.
Prices of oil continued the slide begun in October, as slack demand
and strong production (especially by North Sea and OPEC producers)
continued to weigh on prices. The sharp drop in the quantity of oil
imported appears to reflect the desire to draw down large inven-
tories. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics suggest that
inventories were also drawn down in January, with imports likely to
average near 8.0 mb/d for the month, compared with the monthly
average of 9.3 mb/d for the fourth quarter of 1993.

Since early February, when frigid U.S. weather pushed the
near-term West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract price to almost
$16,00 per barrel, spot and future oil prices have fallen on
balance. Most recently, the near-term contract price has traded
near $14.75 per barrel as the March Gulf Cooperation Council meeting
ended with no indication of production restraint. OPEC ministers
are scheduled to meet on March 25 in Geneva. The price of oil
imports in January is estimated to have been near $12.30 per barrel,
with February's price likely to have remained near that level.
Prices of Exports and Non-oil Imports
Prices of U.S. nonagricultural exports (see table on following
page) rose 0.4 percent in January; this was the only notable
increase reported since last May. Contributing to the increase were
run-ups in prices of industrial supplies (building materials),
automotive products, and consumer goods. Prices of agricultural
exports jumped 2.6 percent in January, the third consecutive monthly
increase. The largest increases were reported for wheat and rice.
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports rose 0.3 percent in January,
sustaining the December increase. Aside from consumer goods.
increases were recorded in every major trade category. Most
notably, prices of imports of non-oil industrial supplies increased
as the result of price increases for imported unfinished metals and
electricity.
U.S. Current Account
In the fourth quarter, the deficit in the U.S. current account
widened by $13.8 billion (annual rate) as declines in net investment
income, net unilateral transfers, and net services more than offset
a narrowing in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit. Net investment
income fell as payments on direct investments in the United States
(no longer depressed by foreign losses in U.S. real estate markets)

surged. An increase in U.S. government grants accounted for the
decline in net unilateral transfers; as usual all of U.S. government
aid to Israel for the fiscal year was transferred in the fourth
quarter. Payments by U.S. residents for travel abroad (including
passenger fares) increased sharply.
For the year 1993, the current account balance fell by $42.8
billion, largely the result of a weakening in the trade balance.
Net services and transfers were little changed in 1993; almost all
categories of service receipts and payments recorded increases over
the year. Declines in receipts for U.S. portfolio investments
abroad (due to falling interest rates) more than offset a reduction
in payments to foreigners on portfolio investments in the United
States, reducing the balance on net investment income.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official holdings in the United States increased
substantially in January, continuing the pattern of large official
inflows that occurred in 1993 (line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table on the next page). The G-10
countries accounted for much of the increase. However, little of
this official inflow was directly associated with reported exchange
market intervention in January. There were also significant
increases in holdings of certain developing countries in Asia.
Partial information from the FRBNY indicates additional increases in
holdings by some G-10 countries in February.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities fell sharply
in January (line 4). There were substantial net private sales of
U.S. Treasury securities (line 4a); net sales by Japanese residents
($4 billion) almost completely reversed their substantial net
purchases recorded in the fourth quarter of 1993. In contrast,
private foreign net purchases of U.S. agency securities (included in
line 4b) remained strong. Net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds
also dropped sharply in January, probably reflecting the temporary
lull in the announcement of new issues of Eurobonds towards the end
of 1993. In contrast, net foreign purchases of U.S. corporate
stocks remained strong.
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities remained near record
levels in January (line 5). As in 1993, most U.S. purchases of
foreign securities were from Europe, Canada, and Japan. However,
U.S. residents also made additional investments in certain emerging
markets, particularly in Latin America. The volume of Yankee bond
issues was very large in the first two months of 1994. including
issues by the governments of China and Colombia. Yacimientos

Banks continued to bring in funds from their own foreign
offices and IBFs in the first two months of 1994 on a monthly
average basis. (See line 1 of the International Banking Data table
on next page.) Credit extended to U.S. nonbanks by the foreign
offices of U.S.-chartered banks has been flat recently (line 2a).
However, it should be noted that such loans booked at the Caribbean
offices of foreign-chartered banks are much larger (line 2b). The
Treasury International Capital (TIC) Reports in principle cover
offshore loans from both U.S. and foreign-chartered banks (line 4).
However, coverage is clearly inadequate and recent increases are
largely attributable to improved compliance and reporting made
possible by comparisons with the new FFIEC 002s, which provides
reports on Caribbean offices of foreign-chartered banks.
Data recently released by BEA indicate that U.S. direct
investment capital outflows (line 6 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table) rose to record levels in 1993.
swelled by increased reinvested earnings and new equity flows.
While the bulk of the increase in U.S. direct investment abroad went
to Europe, flows to South and Central America were also large; they
rose from $6 billion in 1992 to $10 billion in 1993. Foreign direct
investment in the United States (line 7) rebounded in 1993 from the
extremely depressed 1992 level, but remained far below the peak of
$68 billion reached in 1989. Direct investors from Western Europe
accounted for virtually all the inflows.
The statistical discrepancy in the U.S. international
transactions accounts rose to almost $27 billion in 1993. Increased
foreign holdings of U.S. currency, which are not currently covered
in the accounts, contributed to the positive discrepancy. BEA plans

currency in the accounts starting in June.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average foreign exchange value of the dollar
declined more than 1-1/4 percent on balance from immediately
preceding the February FOMC meeting. Concern over the breakdown of
trade negotiations between the United States and Japan,
disappointment with the pace of monetary easing in Germany, and,
late in the period, an increase in uncertainty about U.S. economic
policies generally in the wake of the Whitewater investigation have
contributed to the downward pressure on the dollar. On balance over
the period, the dollar depreciated 2-1/2 percent against the mark
and 2 percent against the yen. These declines came despite the
tightening of U.S. monetary policy announced on February 4, which
caught the market somewhat by surprise, and the subsequent flow of
data releases indicating that U.S. economic activity is generally
strong.
The failure of the United States and Japan to reach an
agreement on trade issues prompted a sharp decline in the value of
the dollar against the yen in mid-February. The Bank of Japan
responded to the decline with sizable intervention purchases of
dollars over the course of subsequent weeks.
On February 17. the Bundesbank announced a reduction in its
discount rate of 50 basis points to 5-1/4 percent, making room for
further declines in its RP rate, which had been fixed at 6 percent
since early December. However, since the cut in the discount rate,
the decline in the RP rate has been very gradual, cumulating to only
12 basis points. The slow pace of easing over the weeks following
the official rate move refuted once again market expectations that
the time for some significant easing by the Bundesbank had come.

The release of data showing M3 growth in Germany of more than 20
percent at an annual rate from its fourth-quarter average soured
expectations all the more, although recent favorable results in
major wage negotiations in Germany may have rekindled some expecta-
tions that more significant easing is not far off.
Despite the firm stance of the Bundesbank, stable ERM exchange
rates allowed other European authorities to ease somewhat. While
the three-month market interest rate in Germany was essentially
unchanged on balance during the period, the comparable rate in
France declined 15 basis points, as French authorities lowered their
money-market intervention rate 10 basis points to 6.10 percent.
Authorities in many other continental European countries also
lowered official rates, particularly after the Bundesbank cut its
discount rate. Declines in short-term market rates during the
period were as large as 40 to 45 basis points in Belgium and Spain.
In addition, the Bank of England announced on February 8--prior to
the move by the Bundesbank--a cut in its minimum lending rate of 25
basis points to 5-1/4 percent. The three-month rate in the United
Kingdom also declined 25 basis points during the period. Only in
the United States and Canada did short-term interest rates move
significantly higher during the period, with the three-month rate in
Canada up 30 basis points, relative to a rise of 50 basis points in
the comparable U.S. rate. Canadian authorities moved short-term
interest rates higher in part in reaction to the weakening of the
Canadian dollar, which depreciated 2-3/4 percent against the U.S.
dollar.
Bond yields in every major country moved higher in the period
following the February FOMC meeting, with the weighted average of
foreign long-term bond yields up about 60 basis points and the yield

IV-14
on the U.S. ten-year note up more than 65 basis points. It is
difficult to determine in full the cause or causes for such large
increases in yields. The most plausible common factor would appear
to be a coincidence of improved prospects for economic growth in the
major industrial countries and an associated actual or perceived
shift toward a less accommodative monetary policy stance in response
to these improved growth prospects. The rise in long-term rates may
also have been magnified by the actions of professional investors
seeking to limit their losses. The weakest part of this explanation
would seem to be that, while there has been clear evidence recently
of a pickup in activity in some of these countries--particularly in
the United States--the recent evidence of an upturn elsewhere--
notably, in Germany and Japan--is much less apparent.
Some of the increases can be attributed to country-specific
factors. Political uncertainties rose in many countries. The
Whitewater investigation in the United States, cabinet struggles in
Japan, the declining position of the Conservative Party in the
United Kingdom, and the rising popularity of the right-wing ahead of
March elections in Italy have called into question the prospects for
existing policies and policy plans. Concern over developments in
Russia and eastern Europe may have exerted some downward pressure on
the German bond market and on the bond markets of other European
countries whose currencies are linked tightly to the mark. The
sluggish pace of easing by the Bundesbank has also contributed to
higher yields in Germany and other ERM countries. The fiscal
stimulus package in Japan, although delayed, has helped push bond
yields higher there, as have concerns about U.S.-Japan trade
frictions. And inflation fears in the United Kingdom may have been
reignited following the cut in the minimum lending rate, which was
perceived to have been politically motivated, coming as it did in

IV-15
conjunction with a statement by the Bank of England that it
perceived inflation risks to be on the upside.
In
February, the Desk began a program to liquidate System holdings of
currencies other than marks and yen. During the intermeeting
period, the Desk sold less than $1 million equivalent of Belgian
francs and $416 million equivalent of Swiss francs.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries
appears to have picked up early this year. after a mixed performance
in the fourth quarter of 1993. In Japan, western Germany, and
Italy, economic activity contracted in the fourth quarter: in the
United Kingdom and Canada, economic recovery gained momentum, and in
France real GDP recorded its third consecutive quarter of modest
positive growth. In January, industrial production rose in Japan
and the United Kingdom. while in western Germany it leveled off at
somewhat above the fourth-quarter average. Japanese machinery
orders and housing starts. German manufacturing orders and retail
sales, and French consumption of manufactured goods also showed
increases in January.
In recent months, unemployment rates have receded in Canada.
the United Kingdom, and Japan, while remaining stubbornly high in
France and continuing to rise in Germany and Italy. Wage and
consumer price inflation has continued to moderate in most of the
major foreign industrial nations.
In 1993, all of the foreign G-7 countries registered
improvements in their external accounts: this improvement was the
counterpart of the $40 billion deterioration of the U.S. current

account. Japan racked up a record current account surplus of $129
billion, and France posted a record trade surplus of $16 billion.
Italy's current account swung from a large deficit in 1992 to a
moderate surplus in 1993. The U.K. trade deficit and current
account deficits in Germany and Canada were down somewhat from their
1992 levels.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, the economy appears to
have weakened in the fourth quarter but may have revived somewhat at
the start of 1994. Industrial production, housing starts, and new
car registrations declined strongly in the fourth quarter but
recovered somewhat in January. The ratio of job offers to
applicants remained flat in January, while the unemployment rate
(s.a.) fell to 2.7 percent in January from 2.8 percent in December.
In the Bank of Japan's most recent economic survey (Tankan),
the index of business sentiment for the first quarter was unchanged
from that in the fourth quarter. Firms predicted a 4.5 percent
decline in investment for FY 1994 (which begins April 1) following a
9.2 percent decline in FY 1993.

Consumer prices in the Tokyo area in February were unchanged
from January and were up 1.3 percent from February a year ago.

IV-20
Wholesale prices showed a 12-month decrease of 3 2 percent in
February, reflecting in large part appreciation of the yen.
The current account surplus (s.a.) widened to $129 billion in
1993, 10 percent higher than in 1992. In February, the trade
surplus (customs basis, s.a.) narrowed somewhat and was slightly
above its average monthly level in 1993.
On February 8, the government announced a 15.25 trillion
stimulus package (equivalent to 3-1/4 percent of GDP). More than a
third of the package was in the form of a temporary, one-year cut in
income taxes and other taxes and the rest was in public works
spending, loans, and land purchases. A committee will be formed to
design permanent tax reform legislation, to be passed within the
calendar year. The package is expected to boost the growth rate of
real GDP by somewhat less than one percentage point in both 1994 and
1995.
Real GDP in Germany declined 1.3 percent (annual average) in
1993, reflecting a downturn of 1.9 percent in western Germany and
moderate real growth in the five eastern states. Real GDP in
western Germany decreased 2.7 percent (s.a.a.r) in the fourth
quarter of 1993, following a substantial increase in the third
quarter. A sharp decline in total domestic demand in the fourth
quarter was partly offset by a substantial increase in net exports;
real exports of goods and services expanded at an annual rate of
12.6 percent, while real imports declined almost 7 percent.
During the first quarter of this year. economic activity
appears to have leveled off in western Germany, at least in the
manufacturing sector. Industrial production was unchanged in
January from its December level, but was up 0.4 percent from the
fourth-quarter average. Total manufacturing orders increased in

IV-21
January from December, and were 0.6 percent above their average
level in the fourth quarter.

Real GDP in eastern Germany increased 6.3 percent last year,
following a rise of 9.7 percent in 1992. For the year ending in
November, industrial production was 12.3 percent above its year-ago
level, led by strong increases in both manufacturing and
construction.
The West German unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent (s.a.) in
February, while that in eastern Germany was 17.1 percent (n.s.a.).
Negotiations between the IG Metall union that represents 3-1/2 to 4
million engineering workers and the engineering employers associa-
tion Gesamtmetall reached a conclusion on March 5, averting a strike
of 10,000 engineering workers that was scheduled to begin two days
later. The agreement calls for a 2 percent increase in wages
beginning in June, and cuts in some benefits, leaving overall
compensation about unchanged this year. The agreement allows for
reductions in the work week from the current 36 hours to as few as
30 hours. A wage compromise was reached for 3-1/2 million public
sector workers as well, with overall compensation about unchanged
from 1993 levels.
Twelve-month consumer price inflation in western Germany fell
to 3.3 percent in February. Inflation has moderated in recent

IV-22
months despite increases in a variety of administrative prices and
taxes at the beginning of 1994 (particularly the "mineral oil" tax
on petroleum) that had been widely expected to boost inflation
temporarily. Moderating wage inflation and declines in import
prices may have contributed to easing of inflation. Consumer price
inflation in eastern Germany has slowed substantially, to 3.5
percent for the 12 months ending in February.
The German current account deficit narrowed to $21 billion in
1993, owing to an increase in the trade surplus. In December,
exports were 5-1/2 percent lower than their year-earlier level.
while imports were down more than 19 percent because of weak
domestic demand.
Growth of the targeted monetary aggregate M3 picked up toward
the end of last year and was sharply higher in January. German M3
increased 21.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in January relative to the fourth
quarter of 1993. Part of the explanation for the high January
figure is that the year-end level of M3 (which is included in the
January average M3 figure) was substantially above the average
fourth-quarter level.
Preliminary indicators for the first quarter of 1994 point to a
recovery of economic activity in France. In January, consumption of
manufactured products (s.a.) rose 0.9 percent while INSEE survey
data showed that French industrialists expect business conditions to
improve further. The unemployment rate (s.a.) remained stable at
12.2 percent in January.
Real GDP rose 0.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter
after rising 1.6 percent in the third quarter. The growth in real
GDP was entirely due to positive contributions from net exports and
investment. Net exports expanded as imports dropped sharply and
exports rose slightly. Consumption spending was unchanged after

IV-23
rising 2.9 percent in the third quarter. Inventories made a large
negative contribution to growth. For 1993 as a whole, GDP fell 0.1
percent (Q4/Q4) as positive contributions from consumption and net
exports were more than offset by a large decline in investment and a
large drop in inventories. France registered a record trade surplus
of $16 billion in 1993. Imports declined slightly during 1993 while
exports rose steadily.
The consumer price index rose in February to stand 1.8 percent
above its year-earlier level, down from 2.1 percent in December,
The easing of the 12-month rate of inflation was due to large
declines in fresh food and apparel prices that more than offset
increases in excise taxes on gasoline and tobacco. Further slowing
of wage inflation also contributed.
In the United Kingdom. economic activity continued to recover
at a modest pace. Real GDP (s.a.a.r.) is estimated to have
increased 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, with higher oil
production accounting for one fourth of the increase. In January,
industrial production (s.a.) rose 0.3 percent above the fourth-
quarter average. The unemployment rate (s.a.) in February was 9.8
percent, a bit below the fourth-quarter average. In January and
February, indicators of business confidence picked up considerably.
while consumer confidence and retail sales increased on average.
In January, 12-month consumer price inflation rose to 2.5
percent due to mortgage-interest effects. Excluding mortgage
interest payments, consumer price inflation was 2.8 percent, about
the same as in December. Producers' input prices in February were
lower than a year earlier but were more than 7 percent higher than
in August 1992, just prior to sterling's devaluation. In January,
the underlying rate of increase of earnings remained at 3-1/4
percent.

IV-24
In the first change since November, the government set a
minimum lending rate of 5.25 percent on February 8 that resulted in
a 25 basis point cut in base lending rates. Later on the same day,
the Bank of England released its Inflation Report that forecast
inflation in 1994-95 in the top half of the targeted band of 1-4
percent, at just over 3 percent, and stated that the forecast had
upside risk.
Economic activity in Italy remained weak. The average level of
industrial production (s.a.) in the fourth quarter retreated from
the level recorded in the third quarter. The unemployment rate
(n.s.a.), which stood at 10.3 percent in the third quarter.
mushroomed to 11.3 percent in the fourth quarter. Real retail sales
remained flat. On the positive side, consumer confidence rebounded
as did orders.
Inflation has been held in check by weak economic activity. In
the year through February, CPI inflation was 4.2 percent, about the
same as the rate recorded in 1993, which was the lowest rate in 24
years. Absent an increase in excise taxes on a variety of goods
that took effect at the beginning of the year, the rate would have
been 0.2 percentage points lower.
The weak lira and declining domestic demand have produced a
significant improvement in Italy's external accounts. Although
exports (in dollar terms) dropped in 1993 from levels recorded in
1992, a dramatic reduction in imports yielded a trade surplus of
nearly $20 billion and a current account surplus of about $5
billion. In 1992, both accounts registered large deficits.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for March 27 and 28. In
a poll conducted on March 10. 35 percent of the respondents favored
the leftist alliance, 19 percent backed the center alliance, and 43
percent supported the parties of the right.

IV-25
Economic activity in Canada strengthened in the fourth quarter
of 1993. Real GDP grew 3.8 percent (s.a.a.r.), following a revised
1.9 percent increase in the third quarter. Total fixed investment
increased strongly, with business machinery and equipment investment
rising 21 percent (s.a.a.r.) and both residential and nonresidential
investment expanding. Consumption expenditures rose 1.8 percent
(s.a.a.r), and an increase in exports was offset by equally strong
growth in imports. For 1993 as a whole, real GDP grew 3 percent
(Q4/Q4). The current account deficit narrowed slightly in the
fourth quarter, and for the year totalled $19.6 billion, following a
$23 billion deficit in 1992.
The composite indicator index grew strongly in both December
and January. However, shipments and new orders fell in January to
levels below their fourth-quarter averages. Conditions in the labor
market remain weak, although employment rose and the unemployment
rate (s.a.) fell in February to 11.1 percent. Continued slack in
labor markets contributed to a record low increase in wage
settlements for 1993 of only 0.7 percent. Consumer price inflation
remains low. The consumer price index excluding food and energy
fell 0.1 percent in January, and rose only 1.7 percent over the
level one year earlier. Consumer price inflation is expected to
remain low through 1994, largely as a result of sharp declines in
cigarette taxes in February.
On February 22, Minister of Finance Paul Martin presented the
Chretien government's first budget for 1994-95. The budget calls
for the federal deficit to fall to C$39.7 billion (5.4 percent of
GDP) in the current fiscal year. The budget reduces defense
spending and unemployment benefits, and broadens the tax base
somewhat. The deficit is projected to decline to 4.2 percent of GDP

IV-26
by 1995-96. while the net public debt is projected to rise to 75
percent of GDP over the same period.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
Prices of Brady bonds have declined considerably in recent
weeks, continuing their fall since the beginning of the year.
Between end-December 1993 and mid-March. Brady bond prices declined
by almost 15 percent for Mexico, over 15 percent for Argentina, and
by nearly 20 percent for Venezuela. These declines reflect country
developments, the rise in dollar interest rates, and investor
skittishness in emerging markets.
In Mexico, economic performance has been disappointing, and
there is uncertainty about the political and economic ramifications
of the recent civil unrest. In Venezuela, the new administration
faces serious challenges with respect to fiscal deficit reduction
and banking stability. Brazil's real GDP grew by 5 percent in 1993,
but inflation has remained very high. Economic activity in China,
and to a lesser extent, in Korea, has been strong. In Russia,
economic activity has continued to plummet. On March 10, Poland
reached agreement with commercial bank creditors on a Brady-style
debt restructuring package.
Individual country notes. Mexico's real GDP grew only 0.4
percent in 1993. down from 2.6 percent in 1992. After a 1.2 percent
contraction in the third quarter from the year-earlier level, the
economy showed virtually no change in the fourth quarter compared
with the same period of 1992. In February, the announcement of weak
growth performance, disappointing company earnings reports, and
concerns about the political and economic ramifications of the
rebellion in the state of Chiapas prompted a downward revision of
market sentiment about the attractiveness of investments in Mexico.
Stock prices, which had reached an all-time peak on February 8,

IV-27
closed 18 percent lower on March 15. Over the February 22-24
period, the peso depreciated nearly 4 percent; the Bank of Mexico
reportedly chose not to support it. The exchange rate was 3.21
pesos per dollar on March 15, having depreciated by 6.2 percent
since February 21. The exchange rate depreciation in late February
occurred as interest rates reached new lows, but rates then turned
up. At the auction of March 16, the 28-day Treasury-bill rate was
93.9 percent. 58 basis points above the February 23 low.
The CPI rose 0.5 percent in February. bringing the year-over-
year increase to 7.2 percent, down from an increase of 10.9 percent
for the twelve months through February 1993.
President Salinas has nominated Bank of Mexico Director General
Miguel Mancera to continue as governor of the Bank of Mexico after
it becomes an autonomous entity on April 1. Mancera will serve a
term of 3 years and 9 months. After that, the term will be six
years. The terms of the four deputy governors, which will be
staggered, will be eight years.
Brazil's real GDP rose by 5 percent in 1993, compared with a
decline of 0.9 percent in 1992. Growth was spurred by expansionary
fiscal policies, mainly in the first quarter of 1993. However,
Brazil has yet to move aggressively to reduce persistent fiscal
deficits and high inflation. Monthly inflation was over 40 percent
in January and February. In early March, Brazil introduced the Real
Unitary Value (URV), a unit of account that the government hopes
will serve as a transition to the introduction of a new and stable
currency in two to three months. The URV is pegged one for one with
the dollar and is adjusted against the cruzeiro daily. Although the
government has hoped that all wages, prices, and financial contracts
will be denominated in URVs, there has been no indication that use
of the URV has been widespread.

IV-28
It remains unclear whether Brazil will secure an IMF program
soon, which would facilitate the implementation of the $35 billion
Brady-style commercial bank debt rescheduling package. Brazilian
officials maintain that Brazil will secure an IMF stand-by arrange-
ment in time for the bank debt agreement to be implemented by the
April 15 deadline.
In Argentina, the merchandise trade deficit reached an
estimated $2.3 billion in 1993, up from $1.3 billion a year earlier.
Imports were up 12.4 percent, while exports rose by 5.6 percent.
Consumer prices in Argentina were unchanged in February, and
stood 5.8 percent higher than a year earlier.
In Venezuela, the new administration of President Rafael
Caldera. inaugurated on February 2, faces serious challenges with
respect to fiscal deficit reduction and banking stability. The
fiscal deficit reached an estimated 10 percent of GDP in 1993, up
from 6 percent of GDP a year earlier. The Caldera administration
has proposed budgetary measures to Congress that are aimed at
meeting a fiscal deficit target of 2 percent of GDP in 1994.
However, especially because lower oil prices will reduce oil revenue
by an estimated 2.5 percent of GDP in 1994, substantial further
fiscal tightening will be needed to meet the deficit target.
Weak economic activity, rising real interest rates, poor bank
management, and increasing uncertainty about future inflation have
created serious problems in the banking system. In mid-January,
Venezuela's second largest bank, Banco Latino, was taken over by
government regulators. Banco Latino's problems weakened the
public's already shaky confidence in the banking system, resulting
in heavy withdrawals of bank deposits and substitution into dollars
in recent weeks.

IV-29
Monetary authorities have estimated that $900 million (1.5
percent of GDP) will be required to repay depositors and
recapitalize Banco Latino, so that it can resume normal operations
within a few months. The public deposit insurance agency has
extended aid to Banco Latino and to six other financial
institutions, while the central bank has cut reserve requirements by
3 percentage points and has intervened to stabilize the bolivar. As
of early March, the central bank's net foreign reserves had fallen
to $6.9 billion, about $1.5 billion lower than in early January.
Taiwan recorded a trade surplus of $150 million for the first
two months of 1994, down from a surplus of $255 million for the same
period of 1993. Exports were up 3.8 percent, while imports were up
6.7 percent. Inflation has remained low; consumer prices in
February were 3.9 percent higher than a year earlier. In early
March. Taiwan increased the ceiling on investment by foreign
institutions in the stock market from $5 billion to $7.5 billion.
In China, real GDP grew a revised 13.4 percent in 1993.
Anecdotal evidence indicates that the economy had continued its
strong growth in the first quarter of 1994. Industrial production
was 20 percent higher in January than a year earlier, after
adjusting for the Lunar New Year falling in January last year and in
February this year. Urban prices in January were 23.3 percent
higher than a year earlier. In an effort to meet the official goal
of slowing growth to 9 percent in 1994, central government officials
announced restrictions on new fixed investments in late January.
There have been no indications, however, that restrictions are
having any effect. The high rate of fixed investment last year,
which rose by 58 percent, is widely seen as a major reason for the
overheating of the economy in 1993.

IV-30
Imports in January 1994 were 78 percent higher than in January
1993, while exports were 43 percent higher, leading to a January
1994 trade deficit of $900 million, down from a surplus of $150
million in January 1993.
In early March. China arrested or detained several prominent
pro-democracy dissidents, prompting criticism from U.S. officials.
To renew China's most-favored nation (MFN) trade status, President
Clinton must declare that China has made progress on human rights by
early June. If the United States revokes MFN, Chinese exports to
the United States would be disrupted and China may retaliate against
U.S. firms.
In Korea, economic activity remains robust, in part because
demand for exports from China and other Asian countries has been
strong and because monetary policy has been accommodative since
early 1993. Manufacturing production was 9 percent higher in
1993-Q4 than a year earlier, and also exhibited strong growth in
January. Inflation has increased significantly in the past few
months after having remained stable at an annual rate of about 4-3/4
percent during the first three quarters of 1993. The consumer price
index was 6.8 percent higher in February 1994 than a year earlier.
Concern about inflation has led authorities to tighten liquidity in
the past few weeks and to adopt informal price controls.
Korea's merchandise exports increased by 7.8 percent in 1993.
Merchandise imports increased by only 2.1 percent in 1993, as weak
investment demand in 1993-H1 limited demand for imported capital
goods. The substantial improvement in the merchandise trade balance
contributed to a shift in the current account balance from a deficit
of $4.5 billion in 1992 to a surplus of $450 million in 1993 --
Korea's first current account surplus since 1989.

IV-31
In Russia, real GDP dropped an estimated 12 percent during
1993, and industrial production fell 16 percent. The contraction in
economic activity continued in early 1994; industrial production in
January was 26 percent below its January 1993 level. Monthly
inflation climbed to 22 percent in January from 12 percent in
December. This increase reflected large rate hikes for services and
strong aggregate demand fueled by high money growth. Preliminary
reports suggest, however, that February inflation fell to 9.9
percent, an 18-month low.
In a March 3 Cabinet meeting, government ministers approved a
draft budget that limits the 1994 fiscal deficit to about 62
trillion rubles, an estimated 10.2 percent of GDP. Reformers
maintain that projected revenues are too optimistic and predict that
the actual deficit will be around 100 trillion rubles.
After falling almost 24 percent during the first three weeks in
January, the ruble remained stable until late February, when it
depreciated further, leaving the exchange rate at 1716 rubles per
dollar on March 15. The latest depreciation followed the
government's release of arrears payments to the agriculture and
mining sectors.
On March 10, Poland and commercial bankers agreed to conditions
to reduce the country's commercial bank debt. Poland's medium and
long-term debt of $8.1 billion will be swapped for one of several
options, including a collateralized discount bond, a collateralized
par bond at below market interest rates, and new money. In
addition, $3.8 billion in interest arrears will be converted into
20-year bonds including a 7-year grace period, and $1.1 billion in
trade credits will be bought back by Poland. Early indications are
that Poland has satisfied the performance criteria of its IMF stand-
by arrangement.
