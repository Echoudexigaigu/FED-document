text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The indications from the labor market are that the economy has
maintained a strong forward momentum this year, interrupted only
briefly by severe winter weather. Average monthly gains in payroll
employment during the first four months of the year exceeded the
improved fourth-quarter pace, workweeks lengthened, and the
unemployment rate continued to move lower. Figures on expenditures
have not exhibited comparable strength; subsequent data may
eliminate this seeming discrepancy, but it is certainly
conceivable that productivity growth slowed markedly after surging
in the latter half of 1993. To date, higher interest rates and
lower share prices have left little clear imprint on the recovery
with the possible exception of a modest effect in the housing
market. Wage and price trends have thus far remained favorable
despite the tightening of markets--with the exception of industrial
and construction materials prices.
Employment and Unemployment
Labor demand has displayed substantial strength this year.
After adjustment for Teamsters and other workers on strike, nonfarm
payroll employment advanced 341,000 in April, raising the average
monthly increase in 1994 to more than 260,000--up from about 200.000
at the end of 1993. The official unemployment rate edged down
further last month, to 6.4 percent, and other indicators usually
associated with weak labor demand--the number of persons working
part time for economic reasons and the proportion of the unemployed
who had lost jobs--also fell.
Gains in payroll employment in April were concentrated in three
sectors. In two cases--construction and retail eating and drinking
places--the sizable increases likely represented rebounds from
weather-related weakness earlier in the year. In addition, the

redesign of the CPS in January 1994.

services industry added 146,000 jobs; more than a third were at
personnel supply services firms. In manufacturing, a rise in the
number of production workers narrowly exceeded a decline in the
number of supervisory workers. Apart from the striking Teamsters,
the employment increase in transportation and public utilities also
was small.
The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers
remained at an unusually high level in April, suggesting that the
March surge in hours reflected more than a temporary rebound from
the weather-depressed level of February. The overall manufacturing
workweek and the level of factory overtime were at postwar highs in
March and April.
As noted above, the unemployment rate continued its descent in
April. Adjusting for the possible bias in seasonal adjustment, the
jobless rate in April likely was 6.6 percent compared with a rate of
about 7 percent, as estimated by the parallel survey in the fourth
quarter. The BLS projection of the old unemployment rate, based on
payroll employment and insured unemployment, moved similarly; that
projection places the current rate at about 6.1 percent--down from
6-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector currently is
estimated to have risen 0.5 percent, at an annual rate, in the first
quarter of 1994, after surging at a 6.4 percent rate in the previous
quarter.1 Over the past four quarters, nonfarm business output
per hour rose 2-1/2 percent--down from the 3-1/2 percent pace
1. The data used to calculate labor productivity include the
hours of supervisory as well as production workers, unpaid family
workers, and self-employed persons in the nonfarm business sector.
The hours of unpaid family and self-employed workers are derived
from the household survey. Rather than allow a break in the hours
series as a result of the CPS redesign, the BLS made judgmental
estimates of growth in the hours of the self-employed and of unpaid
family workers.

earlier in the recovery but still well above our estimate of the
cyclically adjusted trend growth rate.
Industrial Production
The index of industrial production evidently rose appreciably
in April but probably less than the average pace of around
1/2 percent per month in the first quarter. On a quarterly average
basis, output grew at a 7.7 percent annual rate in the January-March
period, boosted, in large part, by another spurt in assemblies of
motor vehicles and by a weather-related boost to electricity
generation. Output of other consumer goods and business equipment
excluding office and computing equipment grew slowly during the
first quarter, as weather-related stoppages early in the year were
only partly offset by a strong rebound in March.

e Staff estimate.
In April, a sizable increase in manufacturing output excluding
motor vehicles and parts was partly offset by a 500,000-unit decline
in motor vehicle assemblies and a slowing of electricity generation.
Because automakers stepped up production sharply at the beginning of
the year and are operating close to capacity, second-quarter
production schedules are substantially lower than first-quarter
output on a seasonally adjusted basis. (The number of vehicles

has been fairly constant so far this year and is not scheduled to
change significantly for the remainder of the current quarter.)
Recent indicators of industrial activity remain very favorable.
Production worker hours edged up 0.1 percent in April and factory
labor productivity has been trending upward sharply. The available
weekly production data for April show further growth in mining as
well as improvements in lumber and appliances. The staff's series
on real adjusted durable goods orders spiked 3.7 percent in March,
after leveling off earlier in the year. Purchasing managers'
reports on orders and production in April remained firmly in
positive territory.
Capacity utilization rates have increased rapidly in recent
months and are now very high in motor vehicles, petroleum refining,
lumber, and primary metals industries. The Commerce Department's
winter survey of capital spending plans indicates that these
industries have revised their planned investment rates up
substantially. The Federal Reserve's estimate of manufacturing
capacity growth for 1994 was revised up to 3.2 percent from
2.7 percent in the March release because of changes in these and
other source data.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of cars and light trucks remained robust in April. The
officially reported numbers show that sales of new light vehicles,
which had risen sharply through March, declined more than
1/2 million units in April, to a 15.3 million unit annual rate.
However, industry sources indicate that the reporting period for
March sales was extended, owing to the timing of the Easter holiday,
perhaps shifting some reported sales from April to March. The

average sales pace for the two months still represents a high-water
mark thus far in this economic upswing.2
According to confidential data, fleet purchases of new cars.
which were boosted by a rebound in sales to rental companies earlier
this year, have eased recently. This pattern of sales suggests that
the shortfall in purchases that occurred during the second half of
last year owing to limited supplies has been recouped (chart). The
need to satisfy pent-up demand for fleet cars explains part of the
surge in auto assemblies at the turn of the year.

Motor vehicle producers have recently expanded U.S. production
capacity for both parts and assemblies. Light truck capacity has
been increased by about 50,000 units for the current model year, and
plans have been announced to substantially boost production
capability for the 1995 model year. For both years, this increased
capacity will be achieved mainly by adding shifts. In addition,
Ford and Chrysler have begun assembling new light truck models in
Canada and Mexico this quarter, which will add about 0.3 million

units to annual North American production capacity.3 Most of
these vehicles will likely be exported to the United States.
Personal Income and Consumption
According to BEA's advance estimate, real PCE rose 3.8 percent,
at an annual rate, in the first quarter. As noted above, sales of
cars and light trucks grew substantially throughout the quarter.
Spending on goods other than motor vehicles was erratic from month
to month and posted a comparatively small increase for the quarter
as a whole. The deceleration occurred because outlays for durable
goods such as furniture, appliances, and other household equipment
were little changed in the first quarter after soaring in the second
half of last year.
Outlays for services were boosted during the first quarter by
unseasonably strong demand for energy services in January and
February. Because of the high volume of activity in financial
markets, brokerage and investment counseling services were up
sharply in January and remained near that elevated level in February
and March. A number of other major categories of service spending,
such as housing, transportation, and medical services, posted more
moderate gains.
Real disposable personal income is estimated to have increased
2-3/4 percent, at an annual rate. during the first quarter after
rising 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Excluding the
estimated effects of the Northridge earthquake, however, real DPI

about 100,000 units, which will also be available for sale this
quarter.
4. We would not be surprised if this July's annual revisions to
the national income and product accounts include significant changes
to the estimates of personal income growth to take account of shifts
in income from the first quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of
1993 in response to the removal of the category on wages subject to
Medicare taxes that was part of OBRA-93.

growth was about 4-1/2 percent (annual rate) in the first quarter.
bringing the four-quarter increase, with adjustments for natural
disasters and income shifting, to 2-3/4 percent.5 Moreover,
increases in nominal wage and salary income averaged $16 billion per
month in the first quarter, a shade better than in the fourth
quarter of 1993; based upon the increases in employment and earnings
in April, moderate gains in pretax income continued early in the
second quarter. The saving rate fell 1/4 percentage point to 3.7
percent in the first quarter; assuming the quake affected income but
not consumption, the saving rate would have risen about 1/4
percentage point in its absence.
The recent runups in interest rates have affected household
cash flows and balance sheets through a number of channels. On the
negative side, higher mortgage rates have sharply reduced
refinancing activity and some adjustable rate mortgages already have
repriced at higher rates. Household wealth also has suffered from
the declines in stock and bond prices; by the beginning of May, the
Wilshire 5000, a broad-based index of common stock prices, had
fallen 6-1/4 percent from its peak in late January, while a Merrill-
Lynch index of nearly 4,000 investment-grade corporate bond prices
was down 10-1/2 percent from its peak in October. On the positive
side, higher interest rates have begun to boost asset income.
Indeed, personal interest income has edged up in the past few months
after changing little, on balance, through most of 1992 and 1993.
Despite the declines in stock and bond prices--and the
publicity they have received--consumer confidence has remained
5. BEA estimates that the Northridge earthquake reduced nominal
rental and nonfarm proprietors' income nearly $22 billion (annual
rate) during the quarter. This figure is $7-3/4 billion larger than
the preliminary estimate released last month. The adjusted income
calculation cited above also takes out the estimated after-tax
effects of income shifting between 1992:Q4 and 1993:Q1. the San
Francisco earthquake, last year's flood, and hurricanes Hugo,
Andrew, and Iniki.

relatively upbeat. The Michigan index of consumer sentiment rose
considerably around the turn of the year and has maintained that
elevated level in recent months. Households' assessments of current
economic conditions have edged up a bit since January, and, even
though a record proportion of respondents last month reported that
they expected interest rates to rise over the next year. the
deterioration in expected business conditions has been modest.
Housing Markets
Housing starts and home sales rose in March from their weather-
depressed levels of January and February, but the size of the
rebounds suggests that higher mortgage rates may have begun to
constrain demand.
Single-family starts rose 11 percent in March yet remained
significantly below the pace of late last year. The regional
pattern of starts in March hints that the weather explains at least
part of the gain. Starts rose 30 percent in the Midwest, where the
weather in January and February had been severe and the falloff in
starts had been particularly large. Permit issuance, however,
increased less in March than did starts, and the level of issuance
suggests slightly less construction than does the starts estimate.
Sales of new and existing homes also posted significant gains
in March but remained below their fourth-quarter averages. Interest
rates on fixed rate mortgages rose about 50 basis points in March to
a level 130 basis points above the low recorded in October,
impinging on cash-flow affordability.
House prices firmed a bit in the first quarter. The Census
Bureau's "constant-quality" price index for new homes rose
4.2 percent from a year earlier, and Freddie Mac's "repeat sales"
index for existing homes was up 2.6 percent. These figures are near
the tops of the ranges of the past couple of years. Increases in

materials costs apparently have been applying some pressure to tne
prices of new homes (chart). In the first quarter, softwood lumber
prices--although quite volatile--averaged 11 percent above a year
earlier, and gypsum prices were 18 percent higher. Costs of other
materials have increased less dramatically.
Direct measures of housing activity in April and May are not
yet available, and surveys of consumers, builders, and mortgage
lenders are sending mixed signals (chart). The proportion of
consumers reporting favorable homebuying attitudes declined again in
April, and the percentage of builders reporting current sales as
"good" continued to move down in early May. But applications for
home purchase loans at mortgage bankers turned up late last month.
(The brief history of this series, however, makes seasonal
adjustment problematic.)
Mobile home shipments are a small component of total
residential investment spending, but one that has been growing
rapidly of late and, as measured by real expenditures, is now nearly
as large as multifamily construction. The number of mobile homes
shipped last year exceeded the number of multifamily starts by an
unprecedented 50 percent (chart). The recent strength in economic
conditions in Texas and other southwestern states (important markets
for mobile homes), together with expanded financing opportunities
for buyers, appears to be behind the surge.
Multifamily housing starts in February and March averaged a bit
above the level that has held for the past few years, and a
substantial recovery still appears unlikely despite tightening in
some local markets. For the nation overall, vacancy rates remained
high through the first quarter (chart), holding down rent increases.
Moreover, demand in this market is unlikely to grow fast enough to
whittle away many vacancies in the near term.

Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment continued to increase rapidly in
the first quarter, although at a less robust pace than in the fourth
quarter of 1993. Outlays for equipment posted another hefty
advance, while spending for nonresidential structures, which had
been on an uptrend for about a year, retraced almost all of its 1993
gain. A good part of this decline in construction outlays probably
was caused by severe weather.
Among fundamental determinants of capital spending, the recent
increases in long-term interest rates have had a noticeable effect
on the cost of capital for equipment excluding computers (chart).
The cost of capital for these goods was about unchanged in the first
quarter compared with a year earlier; it had been trending down
since early 1991. In contrast, the cost of capital for computing
equipment continued to decline rapidly, as the influence of higher
interest rates was more than offset by the downtrend in the relative
price of these goods. The "accelerator effect." as proxied by the
four-quarter change in output growth, continues to have a positive
effect on investment, albeit less so than earlier in the expansion.
Finally, corporate cash flow has picked up impressively in recent
quarters, so that the need for external finance has remained modest.
On balance, these factors suggest that the climate for investment
remains favorable, if not quite so favorable as during the previous
couple of years.
The increase in equipment spending last quarter was widespread.
Business purchases of light motor vehicles increased further to a
level nearly 20 percent above a year ago, with strength in outlays
for both autos and light trucks. Business demand for heavy trucks
remained strong, and the major domestic makers were producing at
capacity with large backlogs. Elsewhere, real spending for

computing equipment advanced at an 18-1/2 percent pace last quarter.
the primary areas of strength reportedly continued to be PCs and
workstations. Spending for most other types of equipment has
continued to trend up, including industrial machinery,
communications equipment, and capital goods for the service
industries.
Looking ahead, the recent data on orders received by domestic
manufacturers point to further advances in equipment spending in the
near term. In particular, new orders for nondefense capital goods,
excluding computing equipment and aircraft, rose close to 2 percent
in the first quarter after a 10-1/2 percent increase in the fourth
quarter. Orders for these goods have outpaced shipments, and, as a
result, unfilled orders expanded almost 10 percent over the past six
months.
Turning to nonresidential structures, the advance estimates
indicate that nominal construction put-in-place rose only
2.9 percent in March after falling 8.8 percent over the severe-
weather months of January and February. However, construction
employment growth was strong in March and April, and some upward
revision to the construction put-in-place data would not be
surprising.
Among sectors, office construction in March was estimated to
have returned to a level similar to its fourth-quarter average. On
the other hand, the more modest rebound in the industrial and other
commercial sectors (which includes retail stores) left the level of
construction in March noticeably lower than that in the fourth
quarter of last year. Permits issued for these structures point to
continued near-term spending increases.
Construction outlays by utilities dropped sharply in the first
quarter after a small decline last year. In the latest plant and

equipment survey, utilities planned a 3-1/2 percent increase in
nominal spending for plant this year, considerably weaker than the
plans in last fall's survey. The downward revision to spending
plans by electric utilities more than accounted for the overall
cutback in plans for utilities. According to industry contacts,
electric utilities have pared back anticipated capacity expansion,
in part, because they perceive a more hostile regulatory
environment. Nonetheless, according to analysts at the Edison
Electric Institute, investment in this sector is likely to be
sustained by spending to meet the provisions of the Clean Air Act.
Manufacturing and Trade Inventories
On balance, business inventories apparently were comfortable to
lean in most sectors at the end of the first quarter. For
manufacturing and wholesale trade, sharp accumulations in February
were partially reversed in March; the current-cost data thus far
show that the first-quarter accumulation was about $14 billion
(annual rate) below BEA's advance estimate.
Excluding aircraft, manufacturers' inventories expanded further
in March at a $9.7 billion annual rate, after buildups averaging
$18.6 billion in January and February. The accumulation in the
first quarter retraced a string of drawdowns in previous months and
appears to have been motivated by the relatively robust factory
orders. A substantial part of the manufacturers' inventory buildup
during the first quarter was in the stocks of machinery producers,
especially in the computing and office equipment industry, where
orders generally have been firm in recent months. In contrast,
inventories held by aircraft producers continued to decline last
quarter. Inventory-shipments ratios in manufacturing have declined
further; although delivery times have lengthened and materials

prices have been rising, companies apparently have continued to keep
a tight rein on stocks.
In the trade sector, wholesale inventories declined sharply in
March, more than retracing the buildups reported earlier in the
first quarter. More than half of the March drawdown in wholesale
inventories was in the motor vehicle sector and may reflect the
robust sales of imported autos and light trucks during the first
quarter. At retailers, inventories expanded substantially in
February, while sales posted robust gains. The largest buildup was
in stocks at general merchandise stores, where sales also advanced
strongly. On the whole, inventories in the trade sector, at both
retail and wholesale establishments, appear to be at satisfactory
levels.
Federal Sector
Real federal government purchases dropped at an annual rate of
12 percent in the first quarter of 1994. The decline was greater
than the trend implied by recent legislation and reflects the large
quarter-to-quarter volatility of federal purchases.
The continuing reduction in military spending was responsible
for $9 billion of the $11 billion decrease in real federal
purchases. About half of this decline was for durable goods and
storable nondurable goods, notably aircraft, ships, and ammunition.
Normally, volatility in these purchases does not translate entirely
to fluctuations in production (purchases are not recorded until the
military takes delivery); however, there was no direct evidence of a
buildup in the inventories of defense-related manufacturers during
the first quarter.
The unified federal budget deficit for the first half of fiscal
year 1994 was $151 billion, 18 percent less than for the same period
in fiscal 1993. This deficit reduction reflects robust

growth in receipts and a subdued increase in outlays excluding
deposit insurance. All major categories of tax receipts are up over
last year. In particular, individual income and social insurance
taxes combined are 7 percent higher, and corporate income taxes are
up 24 percent. Outlays this fiscal year have been held down by
faster-than-expected declines in defense spending. Indeed, much of
the anticipated decline for all of FY1994 already has occurred,
suggesting relatively flat defense spending for the remainder of the
fiscal year. In addition, strong income growth has reduced income
security outlays; continued declines in average interest rates paid
on federal debt have held interest outlays about flat in spite of
increasing debt levels: higher crop prices have reduced farm subsidy
payments; and accelerated repayments of Federal Financing Bank loans
by the Student Loan Marketing Association have offset education
spending.6 The primary stimulus to federal outlays still comes
from spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and other health programs.
Health-related outlays are up about 12 percent for the current
fiscal year to date--a rise consistent with the growth last year but
much less than increases in 1990, 1991, and 1992.
Daily Treasury Statement data indicate that nonwithheld tax
collections from April 1 through May 6 totaled $66 billion,
$7 billion more than during the same period in 1993.
Nonwithheld taxes in 1994 include final payments on income tax
liabilities from 1993 and prior years, estimated tax payments on
6. The Sallie Mae repayments are scored on a cash basis because
the loans were extended prior to the effective date of the Federal
Credit Reform Act of 1990. For federal loans extended after FY1992,
only the subsidy value of federal loans is scored as an outlay, and
loan repayments are scored as a negative outlay only to the extent
that repayments exceed expectations.
7. Estimated payment rules were tightened for 1992 and 1993 tax
liabilities, which increased estimated tax payments during CY1992
and CY1993 and decreased final payments in the springs of 1993 and
1994. Starting this year, OBRA-93 partly reverses some of this
tightening.

II-34
1994 tax liabilities, and social security taxes from the self-
employed; the breakdown among these categories will not be known
until later this year. Last year, about half of nonwithheld
collections in April and May were final payments on 1992's tax
liabilities.
These data on nonwithheld tax payments do not, by themselves,
provide much information about total personal income tax liabilities
in 1993 because they account for such a small and variable share of
total payments. Nonetheless, when combined with the $24 billion
increase in withholdings in 1993, our estimate of a $2 billion rise
in estimated payments for 1993 over 1992, and essentially flat
refunds, they suggest that liabilities increased about 6 percent
between 1992 and 1993. By comparison, the NIPA proxy for taxable
income increased about 4 percent.
The currently available data provide little insight on the
accuracy of our ex ante estimate that OBRA-93 would add about
$15 billion to 1993 liabilities. Because individuals were allowed
to spread their incremental tax liabilities for 1993 evenly over
three years, any amounts that showed up in either final payments or
refunds this filing season would have been small in what are noisy
series in any event. Reliable evidence on this issue will not be
available until final data on 1993 personal income tax liabilities
by income class are released by the IRS in about two years.
The Fiscal 1995 Budget Resolution was reported out by Senate
and House conferees, and was passed by the House on May 5. The
resolution calls for discretionary spending to fall $13 billion
below the spending caps over the next five years. This was a
compromise between the original Senate bill, which called for
$26 billion of additional cuts, and the original House bill, which
called for no additional cuts.

II-35
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local
governments are estimated to have fallen at a 2.6 percent annual
rate in the first quarter, the first decline in three years and the
largest in more than a decade. Construction spending accounted for
all of the drop: increases in outlays for other goods and services
were in line with recent increases. The sharp drop in construction
spending occurred in spite of quake-related construction in
California and is presumably attributable to disruptions caused by
the severe winter weather in January and February. The advance
estimates for March--which are subject to considerable revision and
are seemingly at odds with data on construction employment--indicate
that construction spending continued to edge down despite better-
than-normal weather.
The deficit of operating and capital accounts, excluding social
insurance funds, appears to have widened considerably in the first
quarter as a sharp drop in federal grants more than offset the
decline in purchases. The drop-off in federal grants was primarily
for Medicaid and reflected quarterly volatility rather than an
underlying trend.
Although aggregate NIPA data indicate continuing state and
local budgetary erosion, the fiscal picture for the states' general
fund accounts--which represent roughly a quarter of the sector's
total spending--has improved overall. All but five states find that
revenues are at or above target, and hence fewer states than in 1992
and 1993 are having to make mid-year budget adjustments this year.
This improvement has enabled many governors to propose tax cuts for
fiscal year 1995, primarily for personal income taxes.
In the spring legislative sessions, crime-fighting
initiatives--such as building more prison boot camps and imposing

Labor Costs
Growth in labor costs continued to moderate in early 1994. The
Employment Cost Index for private industry workers increased at an
annual rate of 2.7 percent in the quarter ending in March 1994. In
the twelve months ending in March, hourly compensation rose
3.3 percent, down from 3.5 percent during the preceding twelve-month
period. The slowing reflected more moderate growth in benefit
costs, while the rise in the wage and salary component remained
below 3 percent. Costs for health insurance continued to increase
at a faster rate than benefit costs on average, but these and most
other benefit costs categories decelerated.
By industry, total hourly compensation during the first
quarter, measured at an annual rate, increased 2.7 percent in the
goods-producing sector. Such compensation increased only
1.3 percent in manufacturing, but it rose 7.0 percent in
construction. Although there have been anecdotal reports of
shortages of construction workers, unpublished data from the ECI did
not show any upward pressure on wages of skilled, blue-collar
construction workers; rather, the acceleration was primarily among
professional workers in the construction industry (for example,
engineers and architects). The acceleration in construction labor
costs was concentrated in the benefits component and reflected a
sharp increase in nonproduction bonuses such as profit sharing and
lump-sum payments. In the service-producing sector, total hourly

compensation rose at a 4.5 percent annual rate in the first
quarter--the same pace as in the second half of 1993.
ECI hourly compensation for union workers increased 3.5 percent
in the twelve months ended March 1994, down from a 4.2 percent
increase over the previous year. This deceleration reflected
moderation in the benefits component of compensation; the twelve-
month change in wages and salaries for union workers was unchanged
at 3.0 percent. Restraint in union wages is also apparent in the
data on major collective bargaining agreements: the effective wage
increase for new and existing contracts was 2.9 percent in the first
quarter, essentially the same as in 1993.
The Teamsters' new Master Freight Agreement seems likely to
continue this moderate trend. If approved by the rank and file, the
contract with Trucking Management, Inc., would raise base wages
about 8 percent over four years. It also increases pension
benefits, allows the trucking companies to ship more freight by
rail, and permits greater use of part-time workers. The
ratification vote is expected to take place in late May.
In contrast to the first-quarter ECI data, nonfarm compensation
per hour increased at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the first
quarter, well above the increase of 2.8 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1993. However, there are several reasons why this
measure of hourly compensation growth in the first quarter is
overstated. First, the income estimates made by BEA allowed for the
fact that the labor market indicators for the February survey week
were not representative of the month as a whole; however, the hours
estimate was not modified, and this discrepancy probably caused the
growth in nonfarm compensation per hour for the quarter to be
overstated by more than a full percentage point. Second, the NIPA
convention puts all of the increase in 1994 payroll tax bases

stemming from OBRA-93, as well as the normal increase in the social
security tax base, into the first-quarter estimate while the ECI
measures these increases as they become effective. This difference
in treatment perhaps accounts for another 1/2 percentage point of
the gap between the two measures. Third, increases in the number of
overtime hours worked boost average nonfarm compensation per hour,
whereas the ECI increases only when overtime pay rates rise.
Finally, the ECI is fixed-weighted, while nonfarm compensation is
not. This means that changes in the industrial and occupational
distribution of employment and hours affect nonfarm compensation but
do not affect the ECI. BLS estimates of the proportion of recent
monthly changes in average hourly earnings attributable to mix
shifts suggest that such shifts were considerable in the first
quarter.
Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers
on nonfarm payrolls, the only data on labor costs currently
available for the second quarter, increased 0.3 percent in April.
Over the twelve months ending in April, hourly earnings increased
2.6 percent, up slightly from the rate of increase one year earlier.
Earnings increases over this past year were within a tenth or two of
the gains posted over the same period of a year earlier in most
major sectors. The exception was in finance, insurance, and real
estate, where increased commissions produced a significant boost to
hourly earnings.
Prices
Price data for April will be released in the next two days.
Through March, however, inflation remained subdued. Consumer price
increases were modest in March, as were producer price increases at
the final and intermediate stages of processing. By contrast, crude
materials prices have continued to rise rapidly, as they did during

much of 1993. Crude material costs constitute a relatively small
part of the value of finished goods, however, and such cost
increases usually do not impart much thrust to finished goods prices
in the absence of more general cost pressures.
Consumer prices--both overall and excluding food and energy
prices--rose 0.3 percent in March. Over the twelve months ended in
March, the CPI was up 2.5 percent, while the CPI excluding food and
energy advanced 2.9 percent; both of these increases were about
1/2 percentage point less than over the preceding twelve months.
Consumer food prices were little changed, on balance, in March.
Prices of fruits and vegetables--which had risen 9 percent during
the second half of 1993 but then retraced much of that increase in
January and February--moved up 0.6 percent. But other food items
posted small price increases. At the commodity level, spot and
futures prices of most farm products have dropped substantially
since the last Greenbook. Livestock prices have been depressed by
high levels of marketings, and, with spring planting off to a rapid
start, futures prices for corn and soybeans have fallen sharply.
Because stocks of several crops remain unusually low, futures prices
will likely remain quite sensitive to changes in weather over the
next few months. Meanwhile, a recent surge in the price of raw
coffee likely will be percolating through to consumers in coming
months.
Energy prices at the consumer level rose moderately in March.
The increase owed almost entirely to a 1.9 percent rise in natural
gas prices, while the other major energy components were little
changed on a seasonally adjusted basis in March. However, crude oil
prices moved up sharply in April, pointing to more sizable increases
in energy prices in coming months.

Excluding food and energy, the CPI increased 0.3 percent in
March after a similar rise in February. Prices of new motor
vehicles were up 0.5 percent, about the same as in February,
reflecting strong demand in that industry as well as an expensive
yen. However, prices of many other durable goods declined in
March. Among nondurable goods, apparel prices increased 0.5 percent
in March after declining about the same amount over the previous two
months. The slower-than-normal introduction of spring merchandise
likely caused seasonal adjustment problems during the first quarter,
exaggerating the size of the January and February declines and the
March increase. The prices of non-energy services rose 0.4 percent
in March; shelter costs were up the same amount. The volatile
airfares category moved up 1.4 percent in March, but auto finance
costs were unchanged after rising sharply in February.

Surveys of consumer price expectations have given mixed signals
over the past two months. The Michigan survey showed average
expectations of inflation for the next twelve months rising to
almost 4-1/2 percent in March and April. In addition, this survey's

stood at 5 percent in April. 1/4 point above its level in January
and February. However, the median of expectations from the Michigan
survey--which is considerably less volatile than the mean--was
little changed over this period, both for the one-year and for the
five- to ten-year expectations. Finally, in the Conference Board
survey, expectations for prices over the next year held about
unchanged at 4-1/4 percent in March and April.
The PPI for finished goods rose 0.2 percent in March. Energy
prices were unchanged after their weather-related jump in February,
but food prices were up notably after declining in the preceding two
months. Excluding food and energy items, the PPI also increased
0.2 percent in March. Capital equipment prices posted the largest
increases: the prices of heavy trucks jumped more than 2 percent
after posting no increase in February. Over the twelve months ended
in March, the overall PPI increased only 0.2 percent, while the PPI
excluding food and energy was up 0.4 percent.
Spot prices of industrial commodities have increased further,
on balance, in the period since the last Greenbook. Among the
metals, steel scrap prices have turned down since mid-March, but
prices of most other industrial metals have moved up. In addition,
prices of other industrial materials, such as cotton and hides, have
increased notably. Indexes of industrial commodity prices hesitated
a bit in early April but have since resumed their upward trends.
The Journal of Commerce index has moved up another 3 percent, on
net, since the last Greenbook, and the Knight-Ridder CRB spot price
index has increased by roughly the same amount. Precious metals
prices declined moderately from mid-March to mid-April but have
since turned up.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Against a backdrop of two additional quarter-point increases in
the federal funds rate, release of data interpreted as showing
considerable strength in the economy, and weakness in the foreign
exchange value of the dollar, market interest rates rose across the
maturity spectrum during the intermeeting period. Money market
rates are up 75 to 100 basis points. Major commercial banks
followed the System tightening actions with hikes in the prime rate,
first of 25 and then of 50 basis points, bringing the rate to
6-3/4 percent and restoring the previous wide difference between the
prime rate and overnight funding costs.
Longer-term interest rates are up 50 to 100 basis points since
the last FOMC meeting, with the sharpest gains occurring at
intermediate maturities. Since the first move toward restraint,
announced on February 4, the yield on the three-year Treasury note
has risen 2 percentage points, while that on the thirty-year bond
has increased 1-1/4 percentage points. Major equity price indexes
are down 5 percent to 9 percent since the March meeting.
As mutual fund investors responded to the erosion of securities
prices, net inflows to stock funds have shrunk while bond funds have
suffered net redemptions. At times, bond fund managers have sold
securities in anticipation of redemptions, thereby contributing to
rate pressures, especially in the markets for junk bonds, tax-exempt
bonds, and mortgage securities. Bond funds stabilized in late
April, but renewed market turbulence in early May may have caused
further skittishness on the part of bond investors. The weakening
of stock and bond fund inflows gave a boost to M2 as money moved
into retail money market mutual funds. Although its deposit
components were weak, M2 grew moderately during the intermeeting

period, bringing it closer to the middle of its 1 percent to
5 percent growth cone. This relative strength showed through to M3,
which was lifted above the bottom of its 0 percent to 4 percent
growth cone.
Gross public issuance of stocks and bonds by nonfinancial firms
has dropped substantially in response to deteriorating market
conditions. Business borrowing has continued to tilt toward bank
and finance company loans and shorter-maturity notes. Higher yields
also have contributed to a marked slowing in gross bond issuance by
state and local governments, while a drop in the federal deficit has
curbed Treasury borrowing. In the household sector, consumer credit
has grown robustly, boosted by brisk sales of cars and mobile homes.
Data on home mortgage borrowing are sketchy, but available
indicators suggest some slackening of demand recently.
Mutual Funds
As net asset values of mutual fund shares declined, investors
reduced their purchases of bond and stock funds in March and April
(table). This in turn exacerbated the decline in securities prices,
particularly in market segments heavily dependent on mutual fund
investment. Bond funds accounted for most of the slowdown,
experiencing hefty net redemptions in each month. Stock funds, in
contrast, had net inflows despite a substantial decline in major
share price indexes.
Among stock funds, net sales of international funds were down
in March and April from the pace of recent quarters. Press reports
attributed much of the slowdown to funds that invest in the emerging
markets of the Pacific Rim and Latin America, areas that suffered
major market corrections. Net sales of domestic equity funds were
little changed from the pace of recent quarters, reportedly on the
strength of inflows from IRA investors.

III-3
GNMA funds--which began to experience outflows last fall--
posted the largest net outflows in March and April. Redemptions of
shares from high-yield bond funds led to a liquidity shortfall for
some funds, forcing them to sell junk bonds; with this additional
pressure on the market, spreads on junk bonds have widened 40 to
50 basis points since the beginning of April. Outflows from tax-
exempt bond funds over the March-April period exerted upward
pressure on municipal yields, but this pressure appears to have been
offset recently by a step-up in individuals' direct purchases in the
market.

Money and Bank Credit
In April, M2 grew at a 3 percent annual rate, down somewhat
from the 5-1/4 percent pace recorded in March, placing this
aggregate near the midpoint of its growth cone. MI contracted in
April, with NOW accounts falling at an 8 percent annual rate after

III-4
growing modestly the previous month. The weakness in NOW accounts
probably reflected the slow adjustment of deposit rates to higher
market interest rates and some contribution from lower-than-expected
tax payments. Rising opportunity costs and the fall-off of mortgage
refinancing activity contributed to a decline in demand deposits in
April. Currency growth slowed noticeably in April, to 9 percent
from its double-digit pace of recent months.
The non-M1 part of M2 grew at a 5 percent annual rate in April,
principally on the strength of retail money market mutual funds as
many investors shied away from longer-term mutual funds. Savings
and MMDAs, held down by sluggish upward adjustment in deposit rates
and the slowdown in mortgage refinancings, posted a small runoff in
April. Small time deposits declined at only a 2 percent annual rate
in April, compared with rates of decline of 5 percent in March and
8 percent for the first quarter as a whole. The slower runoffs in
this component reflected the faster adjustment of rates on retail
CDs, compared with rates on liquid deposits, to increases in market
rates. In addition, the diminished appeal of bond and stock funds
lent some support to small time deposits. M2 plus bond and stock
mutual funds was about flat over the March-April period, reflecting
capital losses on the mutual fund portion.
The growth of M2 carried over to M3, which expanded at a
3 percent annual rate in April following a 2-1/2 percent rate of
growth in March. Despite declines in large time deposits and
institution-only money market mutual funds, increases in the term RP
and term Eurodollar components supported the non-M2 part of M3.
The rapid expansion of bank credit--10-1/2 percent in March and
11 percent in April--was largely attributable to exceptional growth
of securities holdings. The growth of other securities was
primarily the result of an accounting change that limited banks'

ability to net off-balance-sheet items, such as swaps, options, and
futures, when reporting the fair value of these contracts on the
balance sheet. This change accounted for virtually all of the
$25 billion increase in other securities since the beginning of the
year and accounted for about 2 percentage points of total bank
credit growth in both March and April.1 During March and April,
growth of U.S. government securities averaged more than 20 percent
at an annual rate. According to the May Senior Loan Officer Survey
and informal contacts with bankers, some banks view intermediate
Treasuries as good buys that offer a sizable margin over the cost of
short-term borrowed funds.
Loan growth in March and April was led by the business and
consumer categories. Business loan growth was boosted significantly
by the Paramount-VIACOM merger. In addition, according to the May
Senior Loan Officer Survey, business loans, which resumed growing
this year, have been strong because of a pickup in external
financing needs. Moreover, as long rates have risen and share
prices have fallen, some companies may have substituted bank credit
for bond and equity funding. The survey also indicated a continued
easing of terms and standards on business loans for all sizes of
firms.
Consumer lending was robust in March and April. Banks noted
the increase in demand for consumer loans while also reporting
increased willingness to extend such credit. Real estate loans,
which have been quite weak since the beginning of the year,
accelerated only slightly in April. Given the rise in mortgage
rates in the first quarter, some slowdown from the exceptionally

strong fourth-quarter growth would have been expected. Senior bank
loan officers attributed some of the deceleration to the slowdown in
mortgage refinancing, as the refinanced loans originated late last
year moved to mortgage pools.
Business Finance
With yields on corporate bonds up 70 basis points since the
last FOMC meeting, the opportunities to refinance outstanding debt
have diminished further. As a result, gross issuance of public
bonds by nonfinancial corporations dropped to an estimated
$6-3/4 billion in April, compared with the $11 billion monthly
average in the first quarter of 1994. Very little of the recent
issuance has been in maturities of thirty years or longer, and some
bonds were issued with put features designed to address investor
concerns about further increases in yields. The volume of floating-
rate offerings by nonfinancial corporations picked up in the past
two months, as spreads on these instruments tightened. In contrast,
spreads on fixed rate bonds widened a bit in the investment-grade
sector and quite sharply in the speculative-grade sector.
Several junk bond offerings were postponed because of adverse
market conditions. Market reports suggested that the private
placement market was an alternative for some high-yield issuers, as
the improved financial condition of life insurance companies made
them more willing to invest in this sector.
Rising interest rates have been a major factor in the decline
of stock prices generally since the last FOMC meeting. But not
surprisingly, some "interest-sensitive" industrial groups have been
especially hard hit. The Dow Jones utility average has now fallen
more than 20 percent since the beginning of the year. Stock prices
of securities firms also are sharply lower, partly reflecting
expectations of a loss in profits with the prospective end of the

underwriting boom. Evidence of reduced trading profits helped push
prices of money center banks down in recent weeks. In early April,
prices of regional bank stocks rallied strongly on speculation about
potential mergers under prospective interstate branching
legislation, but then they fell back a bit.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations fell to an
estimated $3.6 billion in April from nearly $6 billion in March.
Issuance last month was buoyed by RJR Nabisco's $1.6 billion
offering of hybrid preferred stock (PERCS) having a dividend yield
of 9-1/4 percent, an offering that had been reworked to address
investor distaste for the tobacco industry. Initial public
offerings were off substantially in April in response to lower stock
prices and increased market uncertainty. Because of a resurgence in
mergers and acquisitions, the first quarter of 1994 likely was the
first since 1991 in which net equity issuance was negative.
In the first quarter, Moody's Investors Service upgraded
twenty-seven domestic nonfinancial firms and downgraded thirty-nine,
reflecting continued weakness among investment-grade industrial
credits. Several bank holding companies were upgraded, and none
were downgraded, leaving Bank of Boston Corporation as the only one
of the top twenty without at least an A rating.
State and Local Finance
Municipal bond yields, on balance, are up about 50 basis points
since the March FOMC meeting. This increase is less than the rise
in yields on comparable Treasuries, resulting in a slight drop in
the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields.
An abatement of bond sales by tax-exempt mutual funds has
helped to reduce pressures on bond rates in recent weeks. These
funds continued to face sizable share redemptions in April, but most
had raised enough cash through earlier sales to accommodate the

III-11
outflows without further liquidations. The improved condition of
the market also reflected increased direct purchases by individuals.

Last year, individuals generally preferred to invest through mutual
funds and ran off their direct holdings of municipal securities.
Mutual funds provided a convenient means of reinvesting interest and
any principal payments, and they were the preferred approach for
first-time investors. With the decline in net asset values of tax-
exempt mutual funds this year, many individuals, who tend to be buy-
and-hold investors, saw direct purchases as the more attractive
alternative.
The net rise in bond rates significantly slowed the gross
issuance of tax-exempt securities. In April, the volume of new
long-term offerings fell to an estimated $10 billion, the lowest
monthly total since October 1990. Through the first four months of
this year, gross issuance was down nearly 35 percent from that in
the same period in 1993. Refunding volume was a paltry $2 billion

III-12
last month. Offerings to raise new capital declined to $8 billion
in April, from $10 billion in March, as several prospective
borrowers chose to postpone issues in light of the backup in
interest rates. Even with the postponements, the thirty-day
calendar remains relatively small.
According to Standard and Poor's, the favorable trend in credit
quality that began last year extended into 1994. In the first
quarter, upgrades outpaced downgrades by more than two to one. No
state ratings were changed, but ratings were raised on general
obligation issues of numerous county and local governmental units in
response to improvements in their economies. Several housing-
related issuers were upgraded, reflecting the better performance of
their mortgage portfolios. Hospital-related issuers, in contrast,
posted more downgrades than upgrades. In early May, the opening of
Denver's new international airport was postponed a fourth time. The
delayed opening is costing about $1 million a day in lost revenue,
suggesting that additional borrowing will be required to service
outstanding debt. As a result, Moody's lowered its rating on the
$3 billion of construction bonds that have been issued to one notch
above junk, and Standard and Poor's is reviewing its rating.
Federal Finance
The seasonal inflow of federal tax receipts is projected to
result in a budget deficit of only $9 billion in the second quarter.
The staff anticipates that marketable borrowing will total
$2-1/2 billion, as the Treasury runs off $27 billion in bills while
raising $29 billion with coupon issues. Weekly bill offerings were
cut from $25.2 billion to $22.8 billion in April but have since been
increased to $24 billion. Sizes of coupon auctions are expected to
be little changed. The mid-quarter refunding, conducted earlier
this week, consisted of $17 billion of three-year notes and

$12 billion of ten-year notes; raising a little less than $1 billion
in new cash.
The Treasury also announced that it will continue to study its
experiment with uniform-price auctions of two-year and five-year
notes. In the first twenty rounds of the experiment, the markups of
the average issuing rates over the when-issued rates at the time of
the auction have been little different from an earlier sample of
discriminating-price auctions, indicating unchanged underwriting
premiums. However, a full examination of the success of this
experiment in lowering Treasury borrowing costs would have to
control for other factors, including changes in the relationship
between when-issued rates and other comparable rates.
During the first quarter, government-sponsored agencies
continued to issue debt at a brisk pace. The rise in interest rates
raised concerns that short- and intermediate-term rates were headed
higher and inclined some agencies toward fixed-rate issues instead
of floating-rate debt. Spreads over Treasuries on all issues have
widened 5 to 20 basis points, although they remain low by historical
standards.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on home mortgages have moved sharply higher over
the intermeeting period. The average contract rate on conventional
fixed-rate loans was up about 3/4 percentage point, to 8-1/2 percent,
in the first few days of May. As rates on fixed-rate loans moved
higher, lenders reported an increase in the share of originations
accounted for by adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). First-year rates
on ARMs rose about 2/3 percentage point, to 5-1/4 percent, although
the rate on benchmark one-year Treasury securities increased a full
percentage point. The narrowing of the ARM-to-Treasury spread
suggested that some portfolio lenders were holding first-year ARM

rates low to capture a larger share of the overall home mortgage
market.
On balance, the rise in fixed mortgage rates since last
October's low has paralleled changes in Treasury yields, but the
yield spread has varied, first narrowing and then widening by about
20 basis points (chart). Increased rate volatility was one reason
for the recent widening, but reduced demand by institutional
investors also played a role. One source of this reduced demand was
a decline in first-quarter issuance of real estate mortgage
investment conduits (REMICs) by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac following
the record volume of the fourth quarter (table). So far in the
second quarter, REMIC issuance is reported to have slowed further.
Issuance of new REMICs depends on the ability of Wall Street dealers
to sell the higher-risk classes of bonds designed to absorb much of
the prepayment risk of the underlying collateral.2 The recent
forced liquidation of such high-risk REMIC bonds held by certain
hedge funds, market fears about additional liquidations from other
funds or dealer inventories, and the uncertainty about how to price
such bonds in a volatile market all reduced investor demand for
these high-risk securities and slowed the overall issuance of
REMICs.
A second source of reduced investor demand was mutual fund
sales of mortgage-backed securities to meet shareholder redemptions.
Net sales of Ginnie Mae funds turned negative last fall (chart), but
outflows have accelerated in recent months. A third source of
reduced demand was the steadily declining purchases of new mortgages
by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for their own portfolios. The
agencies had been large buyers through the end of last year,
2. REMIC issuance tends to bid up the prices for newly originated
mortgage collateral in the secondary market and to lower the
mortgage rates offered to households.

financing these investments primarily with callable debentures.
Since the beginning of 1994. however, the two agencies have reduced
their combined net portfolio purchases in response to declines in
the spread they can earn over their cost of funds.
The effect on mortgage spreads of weaker demand from
institutional investors was partly offset by a decline in the supply
of agency pass-through securities (chart). Although net issuance in
the first quarter exceeded that in the fourth quarter, net issuance
has been declining since the beginning of the year, reflecting both
the sharp decline in refinancing volume and the slowdown in housing
activity.
Consumer Credit
Interest rates on consumer loans have not risen as much as
comparable market interest rates since February. The latest
observations of the Board's series on consumer loan rates at banks
are for February (the May survey is in process), but weekly data
from the Bank Rate Monitor (BRM) showed little movement over the
past three months. Average rates on forty-eight-month new-car
loans, which typically track broad rate movements fairly closely,
were only 1/3 percentage point higher in early May than they were in
early February. Yields on Treasury securities of like maturity rose
more than 150 basis points over this period. As improvements in
loan quality have bolstered earnings and reduced the perceived risk
of auto loans, banks have waged vigorous price competition in this
market over the past several quarters. Although many banks in the
BRM survey nudged auto rates up 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point during
April, reports of low-rate promotions continued to crop up in the
financial press.

quarter of 1994, though off a bit from the previous quarter's pace.
A sharp rebound in March saw installment credit increase at an
11 percent annual rate, resulting in a 9 percent rate of increase
for the quarter as a whole. Revolving credit slowed in March but
still advanced at a 10-1/4 percent rate in the first quarter,
continuing a pattern evident since last summer. Automobile credit
advanced strongly in March, reflecting vigorous sales of new cars.

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services.
In February, the U.S. deficit in international trade in goods
and services increased to $9.7 billion, seasonally adjusted. The
merchandise trade deficit widened in February, as exports declined
and imports increased. Net service receipts also declined from the
level recorded in January. For January-February combined, the

deficit widened to over $98 billion (SAAR), substantially larger
than in any recent quarter. A large decline in exports swamped a
smaller drop in imports.
Exports of goods and services in January-February dropped
nearly 4 percent from the unusually strong level recorded in the
fourth quarter of 1993, but still averaged slightly above the levels
recorded in the first three quarters of last year. Exports fell in
virtually all major trade categories, with the largest declines
recorded in exports of machinery and industrial supplies. One
exception was exports of semiconductors, which have risen steadily
since 1992. Exports of services rose 1 percent.

Imports of goods and services fell by 1 percent in January-
February. Nearly all of the decline in imports for these two months
was in oil imports, as both the price and quantity of imported oil
fell substantially in January. Despite a large drawdown of domestic
stocks, the quantity of imported oil increased in February, as cold
weather in North America kept consumption at relatively high rates.
Preliminary Department of Energy statistics suggest that inventories
were drawn down again in March. Along with a small decline in
consumption, this implies that oil imports fell in March.
Offsetting the decline in oil imports in January-February was a
continued steady increase in imports of machinery and non-oil
industrial supplies (other than building materials). Imports of
services were little changed from the previous quarter.
Prices of U.S. Imports and Exports
Prices of oil imports decreased 3.3 percent in March, following
a sharp increase in February. The jump in February was the first
increase in 9 months, as frigid weather pushed up energy demands in
North America. For the first quarter as a whole, prices of oil
imports declined 31.5 percent at an annual rate; this was the third
consecutive quarter in which import prices fell. Most recently,
spot and futures oil prices have increased, with the near-term West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract currently trading near $17.60 per
barrel. As a result, import prices should have increased in April
to around $13.50 per barrel.
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports rose slightly in March following
a small decline in February. For the first quarter as a whole, non-
oil import prices rose by 1.2 percent at an annual rate, the fourth
consecutive quarter of moderate increases. The largest increases in
the first quarter were for prices of non-oil industrial supplies and
automotive products.

Prices of U.S. agricultural exports in March resumed their
recent upward trend, bringing the total increase for the first
quarter to nearly 20 percent at an annual rate. Large increases
were recorded in the prices of a variety of agricultural products,
particularly wheat, soybeans, and feedstuffs, the planting seasons
for which were affected by severe weather in the midwest this winter
and spring.
Non-agricultural export prices rose in both February and
March. For the entire first quarter, prices of non-agricultural
exports rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent, the first increase
since the second quarter of 1993. Increased prices were recorded in
all major trade categories except capital goods.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Banks reported sizable net capital inflows in February and
March, leading to a net inflow for the first quarter of $28 billion
(line 3 of the Summary of International Transactions Table). The
total for the quarter was divided about equally between domestic-
and foreign-chartered banks; both substituted foreign-source funds
for domestic deposits. Monthly average data reported on the
International Banking Data Table indicate a continuation in April of
inflows to banks from their own foreign offices and IBFs (line 1).
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities were strong
in February and March, finishing at over $30 billion for the quarter
(line 4 of the Summary table). Purchases of Treasury securities
rebounded in February and March (line 4a): over $6 billion of the
net in the first quarter was purchased by financial institutions
located in the Netherlands Antilles. Purchases of corporate and
agency bonds were moderate throughout the quarter (line 4b); about
$6.8 billion of the $13.7 billion total represented net purchases of

At close to $29 billion, net purchases of foreign securities

After January, total foreign official reserve assets in the
United States changed only marginally, increasing approximately $10

UnitedStates fell sharply in March, after substantial increases
earlier in the quarter.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average foreign exchange value of the dollar
declined nearly 1 percent on balance since the March 22 FOMC
meeting. The dollar depreciated 1-1/2 percent against the yen.
Concern that the political disarray in Japan would so preoccupy the
Japanese government as to make it impossible for the authorities to
negotiate more open trading relationships or to implement a more
stimulative fiscal policy prompted market speculation that U.S.
authorities would seek a stronger yen to help redress the bilateral
trade imbalance. These perceptions by market participants seemed to
persist even after Treasury Secretary Bentsen indicated that the
United States was not seeking to devalue the dollar against the yen.
Against the mark, the dollar declined about 1/2 percent on balance,
despite the shift toward a tighter monetary policy stance in the
United States and a modest pickup in the pace of easing in Germany.
The two 1/4-point increases in the federal funds rate and a sequence
of reductions in the Bundesbank's RP rate totaling more than 50
basis points pushed three-month interbank rates up 80 basis points

in the United States and down 70 basis points in Germany. The
three-month CD rate in Japan edged 10 basis points lower over the
period. Long-term interest rates also moved in favor of dollar
assets--with the U.S.-German differential up about 60 basis points
and the U.S.-Japanese differential up 120 basis points.
The seemingly unwarranted decline in the dollar during the
intermeeting period prompted U.S. intervention operations on April
29 and May 4. Operations on both days were accompanied by
statements from Secretary Bentsen acknowledging the intervention and
explaining the rationale. On April 29, the Desk purchased $500
million against marks and $200 million against yen. The Bank of
Japan also purchased dollars against yen on that day. Secretary
Bentsen explained that the operations were to counter disorderly
market conditions, citing the previously articulated Administration
policy that recognizes that excessive volatility is
counterproductive to growth and announcing that the U.S. monetary
authorities stand ready to cooperate in foreign exchange markets.
On May 4, the Desk purchased $750 million against marks and $500
million against yen. In his statement, the Secretary stated that
recent movements in exchange markets had gone beyond what is
justified by economic fundamentals and announced that the U.S.
operations were conducted in concert with operations by other major
countries.
In addition to the intervention on those two days, the Desk
purchased $213 million against a variety of currencies during the
Greenbook period, liquidating holdings of all foreign currencies
other than marks and yen in the System and Treasury accounts.

facilities also appear to have contributed to the peso's rebound.
North of the border, the Canadian dollar declined another 3/4
percent against the U.S. dollar. Canadian authorities moved to
offset the stimulative effects of the depreciation by pushing up
short-term interest rates in Canada even more than comparable U.S.
rates rose. The differential between three-month interest rates in
Canada and the United States increased about 100 basis points during
the intermeeting period. The long-term interest rate differential
was little changed.
On April 14 and again on May 11. the Bundesbank announced
reductions in its discount and Lombard rates. The cumulative
decline in both rates was 3/4 percentage point, bringing the

IV-13
discount rate to 4-1/2 percent and the Lombard rate to 6 percent
Similar announcements of reductions in official interest rates in
many other major European countries followed the Bundesbank's moves.
In addition, short-term market interest rates in Europe generally
declined in the wake of the easing of monetary conditions in
Germany. In particular, three-month interest rates in France and
Belgium declined 50 basis points or more during the period. Long-
term interest rates in Europe were generally higher--with the 10-
year bond yield in the United Kingdom up more than 90 basis points
during the period and the comparable bond yield in France up nearly
60 basis points. Political concerns in the United Kingdom,
especially after the local election results in May in which the
Conservative Party made a particularly poor showing, are in part
responsible for the rise in the yield there.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Monthly indicators point to some recovery in economic activity
in the first quarter in all the major foreign industrial countries.
In Japan, signs of recovery have been tentative, with the rebound in
industrial production from its low fourth-quarter level partially
overshadowed by declines in other indicators. In continental
Europe, signs of recovery have been more apparent in forward-looking
indicators such as orders and business and consumer confidence.
Indicators of first quarter output, especially in Germany, have been
weaker. In Canada and the United Kingdom, where recovery is more
firmly established, indicators continue to be positive.
Inflationary pressures remain subdued in the major foreign
industrial countries as wage and price inflation has continued to
slow in response to persistent economic slack. In Japan, price
measures also have been depressed by yen appreciation.

New prime ministers were selected in Japan and Italy. The new
Japanese prime minister. Tsutomu Hata, replaced Morihiro Hosokawa
who resigned in the wake of charges that he accepted improper loans.
In Italy, the new prime-minister is Silvio Berlusconi head of one of
the three parties that make up the Freedom Alliance. The Freedom
Alliance won a major victory in elections on March 27 displacing the
Christian Democratic party which had ruled Italy since World War II
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, data for the first quarter
point to some recovery in economic activity following a decline in
real GDP in the fourth-quarter. GDP data released since last
Greenbook show that real GDP (s.a.a.r.) decreased 2.2 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1993 as the result of a large negative
contribution from net exports. Domestic demand remained nearly
unchanged, as increases in household and government expenditures
offset a sharp decline in private non-residential investment.
In the first quarter, industrial production (s.a.) rose 1.7
percent from its low point in the fourth quarter, while capacity
utilization recovered from an historical low in the fourth quarter.
Other indicators were mixed, with new car registrations and housing
starts up and new machine orders down. The unemployment rate (s.a.)
in the first quarter edged up to 2.8 percent.
Consumer prices (n.s.a.) in the Tokyo area in April were up 0.8
percent from a year ago. The decline in the wholesale price index
(n.s.a.) in March to 2.9 percent below its year-earlier level
largely reflects recent appreciation of the yen.
In the first quarter, the trade surplus (s.a.a.r.) registered
$125 billion compared with $120 billion in 1993 as a whole, and the
bilateral surplus with the United States (a.r.) registered $50
billion compared with $51 billion in 1993.

On April 8, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned, taking
responsibility for political turmoil associated with charges that he
received improper personal loans. On April 25, Deputy Premier and
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata became prime minister. Immediately
thereafter, the Socialists pulled out of the coalition government in
response to the formation of a new parliamentary bloc by
conservatives in the coalition. Hata, who previously has served
both as farm minister and finance minister, is expected to continue
the policies of the Hosokawa Administration. However, he presides
over a weakened minority government that will face serious
difficulties implementing economic stimulus and reform measures.
In western Germany, monthly indicators for the first quarter
were mixed with more forward-looking indicators pointing towards
recovery but output measures remaining weak. Industrial production
(s.a.) in the first quarter dropped 0.5 percent; however, commentary
accompanying the March data release indicated that it would be
revised upward. In April, unemployment (s.a.) edged up to 9.4
percent. Signs of recovery were apparent in retail sales (s.a.),
which rose 1.5 percent in the first quarter from their fourth-
quarter level, and stronger manufacturing orders (largely from
abroad). Survey data show that business confidence has improved and

IV-19
that inventories have returned to levels considered close to normal
In eastern Germany, industrial production (n.s.a.) in February was
16.4 percent above its year-earlier level, due to strong increases
in the manufacturing and construction sectors.

*Percent of mining and manufacturing firms that expect to increase

Consumer prices in western Germany (n.s.a.) in April rose 3.1
percent from their year-earlier level, down slightly from the
previous month. The slowing of consumer price inflation is partly
due to relatively flat input prices. In March, producer prices
(n.s.a.) increased 0.3 percent from their year-earlier level, while
import prices (n.s.a.) were 0.6 percent below their year-earlier
level. Wage inflation (n.s.a.) slowed to 5 percent (year-over-year)
in January, compared with 9 percent one year ago.
The current account deficit (n.s.a.) widened in February to
$2.8 billion; exports have been about flat over the past year, while
imports have fallen more than 11 percent since February 1993.
German M3 increased 15.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) through March
relative to the fourth quarter of last year. The magnitude of this
increase means that it is unlikely that M3 will drop back into its
target range of 4 to 6 percent before late in the year. The
Bundesbank identified several special economic and statistical
factors that have inflated M3 growth: a sizable reflow of investment
funds from Luxembourg to Germany due to changes in the tax treatment

IV-20
of interest income; uncertainty about the outlook for bond and stock
markets; a change in the tax treatment of mortgages on older homes
that has generated an increased demand for mortgages: and the
Bundesbank's method of calculating M3 growth that tends to
exaggerate the effect of a large change early in the calendar year.
These special factors explain why rapid M3 growth has not prevented
the Bundesbank from lowering official rates. On May 11. it cut the
discount and Lombard rates by 50 basis points, its second cut in
official rates in a month, citing improved prospects for lower
inflation as the reason.
In France, indicators for the first quarter point to continued
recovery in economic activity. Industrial production (s.a.) rose
0.6 in February after registering a weather-related decline of 0.2
percent in January. Consumption of manufactured products (s.a.),
roughly one-third of total consumption, rose 0.6 percent in the
first quarter. These increases in production and consumption were
partly due to a subsidy of $1.000 equivalent for the purchase of new
cars that replace those 10 years old or older. The unemployment
rate (s.a.) in March remained stable at 12.2 percent for the fourth
consecutive month. Survey data for April show continued improvement
in business and consumer confidence and that investors expect to
increase investment this year. Data for March show that domestic
and foreign orders increased and that inventories returned to normal
levels.
The consumer price index (n.s.a.) in April was 1.7 percent
above its year-earlier level, about unchanged from the increase in
the first-quarter average. A slowing of wage inflation has helped
keep inflation low. The January wage survey showed that hourly
wages (n.s.a.) in the fourth quarter were 2.4 percent above their
year-earlier level, down from 2.8 percent in the third quarter.

IV-21
The trade surplus (s.a.) increased in February to $0.9 billion
from $0.5 billion in January due largely to lower energy imports.
In the United Kingdom, economic recovery appears to be
continuing at a modest pace. Preliminary real GDP data (s.a.a.r.)
for the first quarter show an increase of 2.8 percent. However,
recently released March industrial production (s.a.) data that show
a decline of 0.6 percent suggest that this GDP estimate may be
revised down, The average unemployment rate (s.a.) in the first
quarter edged down to 9.8 percent. Indicators of business and
consumer confidence worsened in April after improving in the first
quarter.
In March, retail prices (n.s.a.) were 2.3 percent above year-
earlier levels. Excluding mortgage interest rates, the increase was
2.4 percent. Producers' input prices (n.s.a.) in March were below
their year-earlier level but remained 7.6 percent above their level
just prior to sterling's devaluation in August 1992. Annual
earnings inflation (s.a.) slowed in February to 3.5 percent, up from
the low of 3 percent recorded late last year, but significantly
below the 5.8 percent increase registered in August 1992.
In January, the trade deficit (s.a.) was $1.4 billion, down
from $2.3 billion in December. Exports rose 4.7 percent on the
strength of exports to the EC, while imports fell 1.6 percent.
On April 13, Chancellor Clarke published the minutes of the
monthly monetary meetings between the Chancellor and the Governor of
the Bank of England for the first three months of this year. Clarke
stated that in the future minutes would be published with a six-week
lag. Previously, minutes were released with a 30-year lag. This
policy change occurred in response to the House of Commons' Treasury
and Civil Service Committee report on the role of the Bank of
England that recommended a more timely publication of these minutes.

IV-22
On May 5, the Conservative Party suffered its worst defeat this
century in local council elections. It received only 27 percent of
the vote compared with 41 percent received by the Labor Party.
In Italy, available indicators for the first quarter suggest
that the recovery apparent in recently released fourth quarter GDP
data continued. Real GDP (s.a.a.r.) rose 3.2 percent. In the first
quarter, consumer confidence orders for machine tools rose sharply.
Unemployment remained constant at 11.3 percent.
Inflationary pressures remain subdued. Consumer prices in
April were 4.1 percent above year-earlier levels, down slightly from
4.2 percent in March.
In the general elections held in late March, the Freedom
Alliance, a coalition of three right-wing parties, claimed an
absolute majority in the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies, the lower
house of Parliament. In the Senate, the Freedom Alliance fell 3
seats short of an absolute majority. On April 28, President
Scalfaro asked Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of Forza Italia (one of
the parties in the Freedom Alliance) to form the next government.
On May 10, Lamberto Dini, Director General of the Bank of Italy, was
chosen to be Finance Minister. This appointment suggests that the
new government is likely to maintain the budget deficit reduction
policies of the outgoing Ciampi government. Italy's large budget
deficit will make it difficult for the Freedom Alliance to fulfill
its promise to reduce taxes.
In Canada, indicators suggest that growth continued at a
moderate pace in the first quarter. In January and February,
industrial production (s.a.) was virtually unchanged on balance
while the two-month average of GDP at factor cost (s.a.) was 0.6
percent above its fourth-quarter average. Retail sales (s.a.)

IV-23
through February increased 2.1 percent relative to their fourth-
quarter average. Indexes of business and consumer confidence surged
in the first quarter. Data from the manufacturing survey has been
less encouraging: shipments and new orders both declined on average
in January and February. The unemployment rate (s.a.) rose to 11
percent in April from 10.6 percent in March. This increase was
mostly due to a sharp increase in labor force participation. Total
employment was little changed in April after rising in the first
quarter to its highest level since 1990.
A large cut in cigarette taxes in February was responsible for
a 0.8 percent decline in the consumer price index (n.s.a.) in
February, and is expected to keep measured inflation below 1 percent
for 1994. Excluding cigarette prices, the index for the first
quarter was 1.4 percent above its year-earlier level.
Economic Situation in Other Countries
The assassination of the government party's presidential
candidate on March 23 led to increased political uncertainty in
Mexico and severely disrupted financial markets. The peso fell to
the lower limit of its intervention band,
The Bank also increased its offerings of
dollar-denominated securities, and lowered its offerings of peso-
denominated securities, at its weekly auctions. By May 10, there
was a modest rebound in the peso. The Mexico City stock market
index, which had fallen sharply in the aftermath of the
assassination, has also staged a partial recovery.
In Brazil, economic activity appears to have moderated in the
first quarter of 1994, while inflation continues to be very high.
The first stage of Brazil's commercial bank debt restructuring was

IV-24
executed in April. Cuts in payroll taxes and capital goods duties
buoyed industrial production in Argentina.
The prospects for monetary and fiscal reform in Russia appear
to have improved somewhat with the release of the second tranche of
IMF financing. Economic growth remained strong in Korea and Taiwan.
but China's very rapid growth slowed slightly.
Individual country notes. In Mexico a financial crisis erupted
following the assassination on March 23 of the government party
presidential candidate. For four weeks thereafter, the peso
hugged the lower limit of its fluctuation band against the dollar.
Interest rates on
peso-denominated securities, which ranged between 9.3 percent for
28-day bills and 11.3 percent for 364-day bills on March 23, surged
at three of the four ensuing weekly auctions. At the April 20
auction, the yield curve had become inverted, and rates ranged
between 18 percent for 28-day bills and 16.8 percent for 364-day
bills. The Mexico City stock market index was about 23 percent
lower on April 20 than on March 23.
On April 22, the Bank of Mexico announced that, at the April 27
auction, it would offer nearly seven times the amount of dollar-
denominated securities offered in previous auctions and less than
half the amount of peso-denominated securities offered in recent
auctions. The markets greeted these changes favorably. The Mexican
markets were further buoyed by news that talks with the Chiapas
rebels, suspended in March, would resume soon and by the joint
statement of April 26 by the Finance Ministers and Central Bank
Governors of Canada, Mexico, and the United States announcing the
establishment of a permanent trilateral foreign exchange swap

IV-25
facility in the framework of the newly created North American
Financial Group. In late April, the peso appreciated by 3 percent
against the dollar, the Mexico City stock market index rose 19
percent, and interest rates on peso-denominated securities eased.
However, these movements were partially reversed in early May,
leading the Bank of Mexico to increase further its offer of dollar-
denominated securities at the May 10 auction and to reduce its offer
of peso-denominated securities even more. At this auction the Bank
sold $1 billion of dollar-denominated securities at rates ranging
from 8.17 percent for 91-day paper to 8.42 percent for 364-day
paper, compared with a range of 6.6 to 6.7 percent on April 20. The
Bank also sold 500 million pesos ($150 million) of peso-denominated
bills in only one maturity (28 days) at a rate of 16 percent, 198
basis points lower than on April 20. On May 10, the peso was 1.7
percent above the lower limit of its fluctuation band and the Mexico
City stock market index was 13 percent above its April 20 low.
In Brazil, the trade surplus for the first quarter of 1994 was
$2.7 billion, compared with a trade surplus of $4.1 billion in the
first quarter of 1993. Exports declined by 4 percent, while imports
grew by 18 percent. The fall in the trade surplus is attributed to
continued real appreciation of the cruzeiro and to continued strong
internal demand. However, anecdotal evidence indicates that
economic growth has slowed slightly in the first quarter of the year
from the 5 percent growth rate recorded in 1993.
Monthly inflation continues to be in the 40-45 percent range in
recent months. The government has been maintaining that it will
enact a currency reform that would include new rules limiting the
central bank's ability to finance the deficits of the treasury.
Nevertheless, Congress's failure in early May to muster the two-
thirds majority needed to open the economy to foreign capital

IV-26
indicates that the political will needed to enact economic reforms
is still lacking.
In mid-April, Brazil and creditor banks executed the first
stage of Brazil's $35 billion commercial bank debt restructuring
agreement. Because Brazil did not qualify for an IMF program, it
purchased the 30-year zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds needed for
collateral from its own reserves. According to official estimates,
official reserves were $35.6 billion at end-February.
In Argentina, cuts in payroll taxes and capital goods duties
have stimulated higher investment and productivity in manufacturing.
Industrial production in 1993 was about 6 percent higher than a year
earlier, and industrial exports during the first two months of 1994
were up 28 percent compared with the year-earlier period. However,
total merchandise exports grew at a more moderate rate of 4.4
percent during January and February from year-earlier periods,
mainly due to weak primary commodity prices and a poor grain
harvest. Meanwhile, strong demand for capital goods and automobile
parts generated a 55 percent increase in merchandise imports,
resulting in a trade deficit of nearly $900 million during the first
two months of 1994. compared with a small trade surplus during the
year-earlier period. The consumer price index rose by 4 percent
during the twelve months ending in April.
Economic activity in China appears to have slowed slightly in
the first quarter of 1994 amid tight restrictions on new credit.
Real GDP was 12.7 percent higher than the same period a year ago,
after growth of 13.4 percent in 1993. Industrial production was
18.6 percent higher, compared with 24 percent growth in 1993. Much
of the apparent slowdown was in state-enterprise output, which grew
only 2.2 percent in the first quarter of 1994. Half of the state
enterprises reported losses in the first quarter. Inflation remains

high. Retail prices were 20 percent higher than in the first
quarter of last year; urban prices in March were 25 percent higher
than a year earlier. China's first-quarter trade deficit was $1.3
billion. Exports rose 19 percent, while imports rose 18 percent.
In early April, the authorities established a national
interbank foreign exchange market. The new regulations appear,
however, to segment the foreign exchange market into separate
markets for domestic enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises.
Foreign-funded enterprises are excluded from the new interbank
market, and must buy foreign exchange in the existing swap centers.
U.S. bankers in China have argued that the purpose of the new system
is to force foreign-invested enterprises to balance their foreign
exchange receipts and expenditures. Both the IMF and the U.S.
Treasury have expressed concern that the new system lacks
transparency.
In mid-April, the State Development Bank, the first of three
planned policy-lending banks, began operations. In early May. China
announced the establishment of a second policy-lending bank. the
Export and Import Bank of China. The third bank, the Agricultural
Development Bank, has not yet been established. The three banks are
to take over the quasi-fiscal policy lending currently done by the
banking system.
Taiwan recorded a trade surplus of $590 million in the first
four months of 1994, as exports grew strongly in April. Overall,
exports were 2.3 percent higher than in the first four months of
last year, while imports were 7.2 percent higher. Industrial
production in March was 6.3 percent higher than a year earlier, and
consumer prices in April were 3.2 percent higher. In early March,
Taiwan raised the ceiling on foreign investment by foreign
institutions in the stock market from $5 billion to $7.5 billion.

This has led to a flood of applications by foreign institutions;
approved and pending applications by foreign institutions already
exceed the new limit. Effective April 1, Taiwan abolished reserve
requirements for foreign currency deposits at commercial banks, in
an effort to reduce pressure for appreciation of the Taiwanese
dollar.
In Korea economic activity remains very robust. The industrial
production index for manufacturing increased by 10.2 percent in
1994-Q1 from a year earlier, with particularly rapid growth in
electronics and automobile production. However, concern about
inflation has led to a somewhat less accommodating monetary policy
since mid-February. The consumer price index rose by 5.9 percent in
April from a year earlier. A strong increase in investment demand
has induced a substantial rise in imports, especially of capital
goods. Merchandise imports rose by 13.6 percent in 1994-Ql from a
year earlier, while exports grew only 6.8 percent. This contributed
to a widening of the first-quarter current account deficit to $2.5
billion from $700 million a year earlier.
In Russia, the prospects for monetary and fiscal reform appear
to have improved somewhat. On April 20, the IMF Executive Board
approved the release of the second $1.5 billion tranche of Russia's
Systemic Transformation Facility (STF). In the supporting
agreement, the Russian government committed to reduce monthly
inflation to 7 percent by the end of the year, and limit the 1994
budget deficit to about 7 percent of GDP.
Industrial production during the first quarter of 1994 was 25
percent lower than in the first quarter of 1993, and real GDP
reportedly fell 17 percent below its year-earlier level. The
increased cost of fuel and other raw materials, as well as mounting
inter-enterprise arrears, has restricted economic activity and led

to plant closings. Monthly inflation during February, March, and
April averaged only 9.4 percent, compared with over 20 percent a
month in 1993.
During the last two months, the ruble has depreciated against
the dollar at a steady rate of about 1 percent per week. On May 11,
the ruble-dollar exchange stood at 1865.
