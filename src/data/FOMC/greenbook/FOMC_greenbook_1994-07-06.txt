DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Although conflicting signals in the flow of economic data are
not unusual, the degree of tension in the second-quarter figures is
exceptional. Spending indicators, in the aggregate, seemingly point
to only a moderate increase in output, but labor market indicators
are indicative of a large gain. In balancing these conflicting
signals, our assessment is that the economy probably has registered
another quarter of growth at least somewhat in excess of potential.
The remaining slack in labor markets appears to have been taken up,
and the prices of industrial commodities seemingly are reflecting
the pressures on manufacturing capacity. However, wages and prices
of final goods and services have not exhibited any notable
acceleration; at worst, one can point only to a lack of further
slowing in recent months.
Labor Market Developments
Labor demand has continued to strengthen. Although the growth
of payroll employment slowed in May, it was still substantial.
Moreover, the average workweek of production and nonsupervisory
workers rose to 34.9 hours, the longest since 1987. All told,
aggregate hours increased 0.9 percent and were 2.1 percent above the
first-quarter average. Initial claims for unemployment insurance
have averaged about 360,000 since the May survey week, a level that
has been associated with payroll increases of roughly 200,000 per
month during the past year. Looking forward, Manpower, Inc.'s
Employment Outlook Survey for the third quarter of 1994 is the most
positive reading in the series since the summer of 1989.
In the payroll survey, the service-producing sector once again
dominated hiring in May, accounting for 183,000 of the 191.000

increment in total nonfarm jobs. The services industry added 80,000
jobs, even though employment in personnel supply services edged down
and business services as a whole added only a few jobs. Elsewhere,
transportation employment rose 84.000, as striking Teamsters
returned to work. Retail and wholesale trade also grew, but more
slowly than in recent months. Finance, insurance, and real estate
lost 15.000 jobs, partly owing to the slower pace of home sales and
refinancing. Net hiring in the construction industry slowed from
its rapid pace of the preceding two months, and employment in
manufacturing was about unchanged.
The May labor market report also contained the annual revisions
to payroll employment. The payroll data were benchmarked to a March
1993 job count derived primarily from unemployment insurance tax
records, and the bias adjustment factors used to capture employment
growth in small or newly created firms were updated. All told.
employment growth since April 1992 was adjusted upward by about
25,000 per month, with a cumulative increment to nonfarm employment
of more than 550,000 by February 1994.
In the May household report, the civilian unemployment rate
fell 0.4 percentage point to 6.0 percent. Employment rose 534,000.
while the number of unemployed dropped 506,000 in May; this left the
size of the labor force about unchanged last month.
Determining the significance of movements in the unemployment
rate has been especially difficult this year, owing to the
introduction of the new Current Population Survey. Based on
comparisons of the old CPS and the 1992-93 parallel survey, the BLS
earlier this year estimated that the unemployment rate from the
redesigned household survey would be comparable to rates about
1/2 percentage point lower under the old survey. Using this
standard, the May unemployment rate of 6.0 percent would have been

equivalent to a rate of 5.5 percent on the old basis, nearly a full
percentage point below the reading for December 1993.
However, the actual decline in unemployment over this period
likely is several tenths smaller. First, BLS analysts now believe
that the difference between rates as measured by the old and new CPS
may be less than 1/2 percentage point. BLS analysts also think
that seasonal adjustment problems may have overstated the May
decline in the rate and biased the May unemployment rate down
slightly. Nevertheless, even after correcting for these factors,
the unemployment rate has exhibited a sharp decline since late 1993,
seemingly moving from the high end of the range of estimates of the
"natural" rate to a point in the middle portion of the range of
estimates.
Relatively little additional information on wages and
compensation has become available since the last Greenbook.
Although average hourly earnings were reported to have increased
0.5 percent in May, after a 0.3 percent increase in April, their
rise over the twelve months ended in May--2.7 percent--was about the
same as the increase during the previous twelve-month period. Nor
has there been any perceptible pickup in wage pressures in the
incoming data on collective bargaining agreements. According to
data from the Bureau of National Affairs, the median first-year wage
increase negotiated between January 1 and June 23, 1994. was
3 percent, the same as the rise during the same period last year.
1. For one thing, unemployment rates among women early this year
were considerably lower than was suggested by the parallel survey,
even accounting for the continued improvement in labor market
conditions. Moreover, the small "follow-on" survey that the BLS hoped
would aid in linking the new survey to the old actually produced
higher unemployment rates than those from the new CPS. suggesting the
possibility that the higher unemployment rate shown in last year's
parallel survey owed to sampling variation rather than to the re-
designed questionnaire.

Factoring in lump-sum bonuses also yields the same median increase
this year as last.2

Industrial Production
Total industrial production slowed early in the second quarter,
after strong first-quarter gains. Much of the recent slowing
reflects a dropback in motor vehicle production from the rapid
first-quarter pace. Output in manufacturing excluding motor vehicle
and parts has continued to expand briskly.
Motor vehicle assemblies moved down in May to 11-1/2 million
units at an annual rate, compared with an average of nearly 13
million units in the first quarter. Weekly data and preliminary
industry estimates of actual production through the week ended
June 25 suggest a further slight decline to 11.4 million units at an
annual rate in June, a shortfall of about 300,000 units from the
scheduled rate.
2. As reported in the last Greenbook, increases in ECI wages and
salaries and in the total ECI including fringe benefits for the twelve
months ended in March 1994 showed little change from the increases of
a year earlier.

s Scheduled.
Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output
increased at an average monthly pace of 0.4 percent in April and
May, similar to the rapid rate of growth in 1993 and only a bit less
than the robust first-quarter pace. Ongoing strength in production
of business equipment and construction supplies was moderated early
in the second quarter by a slowing in the output of consumer goods.
Indicators of industrial production point to substantial near-
term strength. The staff's series on real adjusted durable goods
orders held at a high level in April and May, after climbing nearly
5 percent in March. Although new orders for nondefense capital
goods except aircraft have retraced most of the March jump, the
level of unfilled orders for these goods remains high, suggesting
that strength in business equipment output will continue through
June. Moreover, among other durable goods industries, orders for
materials and consumer goods appear to have firmed recently. Weekly
physical product data through mid-June show a surge in electricity
generation, likely owing to unusually hot weather.

The rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing in May was

rate of 81.2 percent and the 1988-89 high of 85 percent. Operating
rates for most major industry groups generally remain several
percentage points below their 1988-89 highs; the most noticeable
exceptions are petroleum products and nonelectrical machinery, where
earlier weakness in investment limited capacity. For some
individual product lines--such as cellular phones, popular sport
utility vehicles, and environmentally acceptable refrigerators--
industry contacts report that capacity constraints are restricting
output growth.

Motor Vehicles
Sales of new light vehicles, which had turned down in April
after two quarters of strong advances, eased further in May to an
annual rate of 14.6 million units. So far this quarter, purchases
of light vehicles have averaged about 1/2 million units below the
robust pace of the first quarter, with nearly all the decline
occurring among vehicles produced by the Big Three. The recent
decline in sales reflects, in part, the constraining effects of
limited supplies of some popular models and a return to a more

II-11
normal rate of fleet sales. However, some of the dropoff in sales
may signal softening in the underlying strength of demand.
Short supplies of some models, particularly of light trucks,
have existed for several months and likely continued to impede sales
of these vehicles in June. Producers have been unable to boost
output to match strong demand, owing to capacity constraints at
either the assembly line or at plants that produce parts.
Further additions to capacity (primarily by adding shifts) are
scheduled for the second half of this year, and supplies should
increase a bit.4 However, overall production schedules for the
third quarter are the same as in the second quarter.5
Fleet sales, mainly those to rental car companies, returned to
a more normal level in the second quarter, after surging in the
first quarter. The first-quarter spurt in purchases by rental car
companies reflected a catch-up for sales that had been delayed from
the second half of 1993 because of supply shortages. According to
Ford, the uptick in fleet sales in May may reflect some purchases
that were moved forward from June.6
With regard to the underlying strength of demand for light
motor vehicles, the highly favorable market fundamentals evident
earlier this year have eroded somewhat. Prices have risen
noticeably since the beginning of the year, and finance rates have
3. Auto sales by General Motors also have been limited somewhat by
model-changeover problems at a key Canadian plant. Operations at the
plant were scheduled to be back to normal in April, but still appear
to be short of expected levels.
4. See the May Greenbook for a detailed discussion of capacity.
Since then, we have learned that stepped-up production at a Chrysler
light truck plant in Mexico, which was scheduled to begin during the
current quarter, has not yet materialized. In addition, we have heard
that an anticipated shortage of engines may limit production later
this year, even after assembly capacity has been raised.
5. Four domestic auto plants are undergoing lengthy model
changeovers this summer. These unusually lengthy downtimes will
reduce the level of output in both the second and third quarters by
about 2 percent (0.3 million units at an annual rate).
6. The information on fleet and retail sales from Ford and General
Motors is confidential.

also moved up. The Conference Board series on car buying plans fell
sharply in June, and the series on buying conditions in the Michigan
survey was up in June but remained a bit below the levels seen
earlier this year. All told, we believe that the recent changes in
these market indicators are consistent with a slight easing in the
strength of demand in the near term.
Personal Income and Consumption
Available data seem to indicate that growth in personal
consumption expenditures slowed this spring, after a strong
first-quarter advance. Whether a sustained slowdown in spending is
under way is not yet clear. A large part of the recent slowdown in
spending reflects declines in outlays for motor vehicles, where, as
noted, supply constraints apparently have limited sales. Another
part of the slowdown, at least early in the second quarter, was in
energy services and was related primarily to swings in weather
conditions. Moreover, although the weakness in stock and bond
markets this year may have put a dent in the spending plans of at
least some households, the underlying pace of income growth has been
well maintained, and consumer confidence is holding at a high level.
Willingness to borrow also seems high, as evidenced by the rapid
growth of consumer credit in recent months and by early responses
to the June Michigan SRC survey.
Total nominal personal income rose 0.4 percent in April, but
nominal disposable personal income fell 0.2 percent. Wage and
salary income, which continued to advance in April, likely posted
another solid gain in May, given the large increases in production
7. The April decline in disposable personal income reflects
provisions of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993: Under the Act,
high income individuals have the option of paying retroactive taxes in
three annual installments, the first of which was due April 15. BEA
estimates that these tax payments reduced disposable personal income
about 0.6 percentage point in April. The effect of these taxes on
spending, however, is likely to be spread out over a considerable
period of time.

worker hours and average hourly earnings reported in last month's
labor market report. The year-to-year increase in real disposable
personal income in the first half of 1994 appears to have been well
above 3 percent.
In contrast to the recent downturn in consumer expenditures on
motor vehicles, outlays on other goods are likely to post another
solid gain in the second quarter. However, the increase largely
reflects developments around the end of the first quarter. Nominal
retail sales at stores other than auto dealers and building supply
outlets (the "retail control" group) rose only 0.3 percent in May,
after a 0.7 percent decline in April and a 1.0 percent increase in
March. Combining these data with information on consumer prices,
the staff estimates that real outlays for goods other than motor
vehicles were little changed in May, and that the average level of
real spending on these items in April and May was about 3 percent
higher, at an annual rate, than in the first quarter.
Within the retail control group in May, nominal sales were
brisk at furniture and appliance stores and at establishments in the
"other durable goods" category. In contrast, sales at stores in the
nondurable goods category have fallen 3/4 percent over the past two
months. The decline brought spending for that category back
closer to trend after outsized gains in February and March.
According to preliminary data, real consumer spending on
services fell 0.2 percent in April after registering little change
in March. Spending on energy services returned to normal levels in
March after a weather-related surge earlier in the winter and then
8. Final estimates for the first quarter of 1994 show a rise in
real outlays for goods excluding motor vehicles of 3-3/4 percent at an
annual rate, an upward revision of about 1/4 percentage point from the
preliminary estimate.
9. Nominal sales at gasoline stations fell 1 percent last month,
but separate physical product data from the Department of Energy
indicate that gasoline sales were up in real terms.

fell further during mild weather in April. With temperatures close
to normal in May but unseasonably hot in June, outlays for energy
services likely increased in each of those months. The currently
available data indicate that outlays for non-energy services rose
less than 0.1 percent in April. However, today's release on GDP
includes a sharp upward revision in first-quarter outlays on non-
energy services to an annual rate of 4.4 percent, and an updated
assessment of the recent trend in these outlays awaits tomorrow's
release on personal income.
Housing Markets
Housing activity has rebounded since the winter disruptions,
but, apparently in response to higher interest rates, it has
remained below the late 1993 pace.
In the single-family sector, starts edged down in May after
declining substantially in April. Interest rates on fixed-rate
mortgages in May averaged nearly 2 percentage points above the low
reached last October. As a result, cash-flow affordability of new
homes has deteriorated, although it remains better than it was
during most of the past twenty years. Similarly, starts, even at
their reduced May level, exceeded the annual average of every year
since 1978.
Home sales, though down from their levels of late last year,
also remain quite high by historical standards. Sales of new homes
in April and May averaged about 6 percent below the fourth-quarter
level. Existing home sales have fallen by less, but because most of
these transactions are recorded at the "closing" and reflect loan
commitments made earlier, this series is slower to respond to
changes in mortgage interest rates. Prices of new and existing
homes sold in April and May averaged 2 to 3 percent above their
levels of a year earlier, roughly in line with the increases posted

in the first quarter by "constant quality" price indexes for these
two markets
The most recent data on single-family housing activity come
from consumer and industry surveys fielded early in June. These
surveys also indicate some softening in the market. Consumers
homebuying attitudes have been progressively less favorable in each
of the past four months. Similarly, homebuilders' assessments of
their current sales have been declining for some time. Applications
for home purchase loans have been a bit more erratic, but this
indicator too has been lower, on average, in recent weeks.
In the multifamily sector, the May increase in starts, to their
highest level in 3-1/2 years, is supported by recent anecdotal
reports of market tightening in some localities. Nevertheless, the
national indicators of market conditions remain fairly negative.
The vacancy rate for multifamily rental housing has stayed in the
historically high range that has prevailed for the past several
years. With vacancy rates still high, rent increases in the CPI
have remained relatively low. Most of the gain in multifamily
construction has occurred in the South, where vacancy rates have
come down significantly. One stimulative influence for multifamily
housing has been financing, which, by all accounts, has become more
available in the past year. Investors once again have an appetite
for multifamily projects, and depository institutions appear more
willing to extend construction credit than at any other time since
the mid-1980s.
Business Fixed Investment
The available monthly indicators point to a further rise in
equipment spending in the second quarter, although the gain probably
will be somewhat less strong than the very rapid rate of increase
seen during the past year or so. Spending for nonresidential

structures appears to be headed for a substantial rebound this
quarter, after a weather-related slump earlier in the year.
Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft---an
indicator of near-term equipment spending---posted a solid gain in
May. The average level of these shipments during the first two
months of the current quarter was 3-3/4 percent above the
first-quarter average. Nominal shipments of computing equipment
increased in May, partially retracing their April decline. The
growth trend for these shipments appears to have moderated in recent
months from about 2 percent, on average, per month in 1993, to a bit
more than 1/2 percent per month so far this year. In addition, the
rate of decline in the producer price index for computing
equipment--a series that is designed to capture quality improvements
as well as changes in nominal prices--has slowed. After dropping
sharply last year, this index showed a comparatively small decline
over the first five months of 1994.10 Trade reports, by contrast,
seem to suggest that rapid decreases in performance-adjusted prices
are ongoing.
Excluding computing equipment and aircraft, shipments of
nondefense capital goods have continued to trend up in recent
months, and the average level of shipments in April and May was
4-1/4 percent above the first-quarter average. Looking ahead,
orders for these goods dropped about 3-1/2 percent in May,
reflecting fairly widespread declines. After bounding up late last
year, orders have cooled off noticeably: The first-quarter gain was
10. This producer price index is the main source used by BEA in
constructing the deflator for business purchases of computing
equipment. The deflator for business purchases of computers fell
13-1/2 percent last year, but only 4 percent (annual rate) in the
first quarter. The level of the PPI for computers in May was less
than 1 percent (not at an annual rate) below the first-quarter
average, suggesting that the deflator for business purchases of
computing equipment will show another relatively modest decline in the
current quarter.

about 2 percent, and the level of these orders in April and May was
only 1/2 percent above the first-quarter average. Nonetheless.
backlogs have risen impressively since the middle of last year,
suggesting further gains in shipments for at least the next few
months.
Spending for motor vehicles by businesses jumped in the first
quarter to a record level, bolstered by the increased popularity of
leasing and a surge in fleet sales. This quarter, however,
business purchases of vehicles may be headed for a decline. Overall
sales of light vehicles so far this quarter are lower than the
first-quarter average, and the business share of auto purchases
likely will recede from its unusually high reading earlier this
year. Partially offsetting the decline, sales of heavy trucks
during the first two months of the current quarter were up about 3
percent from the first-quarter average. Industry contacts report
that demand for heavy trucks remains strong and that assemblies are
at or near capacity. Business purchases of aircraft dropped further
in the first quarter, and available monthly data suggest continued
weakness in the current quarter. The problems that have been
besetting domestic carriers do not appear to have abated to any
significant degree, suggesting that domestic demand for new aircraft
will remain languid for some time.
Turning to nonresidential structures, data on construction put-
in-place rebounded in March and April after dipping sharply during
the first two months of the year. Construction in April stood at a
level slightly above the fourth-quarter average. Looking ahead,
permits for these structures, which tend to lead construction by a

by businesses and leased to consumers are included in outlays for
producers' durable equipment.

few months, softened in the first quarter but have turned back more
recently..
Recent data on prices for nonresidential structures indicate
that the excess supply that had plagued this sector in previous
years is slowly being worked off. The National Real Estate Index
(NREI), which measures transactions prices, shows increases over the
past year for retail structures and essentially no change over the
year in the prices of offices and warehouses.. The Russell-NCREIF
index (NCREIF), which is based on appraised values that tend to lag
transactions prices, still shows declines but of a smaller magnitude
than before, especially for retail structures.
Roughly consistent with the pattern of property prices, the
strongest component of construction activity during the past couple
of years has been "other commercial" structures, which includes
retail centers and warehouses. Within this category, the strength
has been concentrated in the retail sector and includes both the
construction of new stores and the modernization of existing space.
Real estate investment trusts, which have grown substantially in
recent years, have been important in providing the financing for
mall construction.
Manufacturing and Trade Inventories
The pace of business inventory accumulation picked up slightly
in early spring, with buildups largely concentrated in segments of
the economy where market demand was robust. For all manufacturing
and trade, inventories rose in April at an annual rate of
$19.7 billion (current-cost), $2-1/2 billion above the first-quarter
average. The pace remains quite moderate, however, and the
inventory-sales ratio for manufacturing and trade was among the
lowest in recent years.

In manufacturing, producers of industrial machinery and
electrical and electronic equipment expanded their stocks further in
April; in particular, inventories at computer and office equipment
makers posted a substantial $2.3 billion increase, extending a long
string of monthly buildups over the past year. In addition, stocks
of metal fabricating companies, which produce many housing-related
items and some consumer durables, also showed a sizable
accumulation By and large, these are industries that have received
strong orders in recent months. Elsewhere in manufacturing,
inventories have shown little net change so far this year. The
inventory-sales ratio in manufacturing still appears to be on a
downward trend.
In the trade sector, inventory changes have been moderate
lately. Although stocks held by wholesale distributors of motor
vehicles rose at a $5.8 billion annual rate in April, the increase
retraced only part of the declines in the first quarter, when strong
motor vehicle sales drew down stocks. For most other wholesale
categories, inventory changes generally were small. In retail
trade, inventories rose markedly at outlets selling furniture,
appliances, and home furnishings, after a large drawdown in March.
In contrast, stocks at general merchandise and apparel stores were
little changed in April. Indeed, non-auto retail inventories as a
whole posted only small net increases in March and April. The
conservative stockbuilding has left most types of retail
establishments unencumbered with excess inventories; at the end of
April, inventory-sales ratios for most retail categories were well
within the ranges observed over the past year.
Federal Sector
The incoming news on the federal budget for fiscal 1994 has
been favorable. The unified deficit for the fiscal year through May

II-33
was only $165 billion, $46 billion less than for the same period in
fiscal 1993; the improvement reflected both strength in receipts and
restraint on outlays. Moreover, officials from OMB and CBO have
indicated that the estimates of the fiscal 1994 deficit that will be
reported later this summer will be considerably smaller than those
from last winter.
Receipts have risen about 10 percent so far this fiscal year.
with sizable increases in all major categories. Corporate taxes
have been especially robust, rising more than 20 percent between the
first eight months of fiscal 1993 and the first eight months of
fiscal 1994. Moreover, Daily Treasury Statements for June suggest
that corporate estimated tax payments were strong relative both to
June 1993 and, after allowing for normal seasonal patterns, to the
first quarterly payment that was due on April 15. Meanwhile, both
personal and social insurance taxes were about 8 percent higher than
during the comparable period of fiscal 1993.
We have received little information since the May Greenbook
that would allow us to refine our estimate of the effect of OBRA-93
on individual income tax liabilities for 1993. Taken together, the
data from the Monthly Treasury Statements for April and May are
identical to the daily data we reported last month.12  Daily data
for June suggest that payments of estimated personal taxes were
appreciably higher than in June 1993, despite the relaxation of safe
harbor provisions; the increase likely reflected a combination of
solid growth in taxable incomes and the higher tax rates this year.
Excluding deposit insurance, federal outlays during April and
May were essentially the same as a year earlier; for the 1994 fiscal
12. In preparing its estimate of disposable personal income for
April. BEA assumed that payments of the first installment of the
increased 1993 tax liabilities added only about $30 billion (SAAR) to
personal tax payments that month. However, that estimate is based on
little hard information, and BEA has indicated that it may be revised
as additional data become available.

year to date, they are up only about 1 percent. Spending on
Medicare and other health programs, which had shown signs of
accelerating earlier this fiscal year, has slowed significantly over
the past several months; on balance, these outlays seem to be
trending up about 10 percent per year. Defense outlays, after
plunging in the first quarter, dropped further in April and May. In
the aggregate, spending on other programs has shown a small increase
in fiscal 1994.13
Various congressional committees continue to debate health
reform, with details of the proposals changing daily. The Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee and the House Education and
Labor Committee have reported out bills similar to that of the
Clinton Administration. The House Ways and Means Committee is
marking up a bill that contains employer mandates and small business
subsidies; the committee is expected to vote on the bill by the end
of this week. The Senate Finance Committee is focusing on plans
that emphasize insurance reforms and subsidies for low-income
groups: however, consensus remains elusive, with the employer
mandate the main sticking point.
State and Local Government Sector
Indicators of state and local spending in the second quarter
are mixed. Employment of state and local government workers edged
up in May after a sizable rise the month before; most of the
increase during the second quarter has been at local governments.
Employment has been trending up at a fairly steady rate of about
1-1/2 percent per year for the past two years. State and local
13. The revised NIPA data released today continue to show that real
nondefense purchases rose at an annual rate of about 18-1/2 percent in
the first quarter. The surge in outlays, which more than retraced the
decline in the fourth quarter, reflected increases in many programs,
including the IRS. NASA, NIH, and FEMA. Large quarterly changes in
nondefense purchases are not unprecedented, but the OBRA caps on
discretionary spending should limit further increases in these outlays
in the quarters ahead.

construction spending fell sharply in real terms in April, to a
level 2.4 percent below the first-quarter average, which already was
down appreciably from the level of late 1993. Much of the weakness
this year has been in outlays for educational facilities and
highways: for both of these categories, which together account for
nearly 60 percent of state and local building, construction had
trended up through 1993 but has since moved back substantially.
Despite continuing large budget deficits for the state and
local sector as a whole, news about the fiscal situation of the
states' general fund budgets, which represent 25 percent of the
sector's spending, has been quite good of late. Indeed, just ten
states were forced to make midyear adjustments to meet their
balanced budget requirements during fiscal 1994, which ends June 30
in all but four states. This performance compares quite favorably
with that of recent years: Twenty-three states made midyear changes
in fiscal 1993, and thirty-five states made adjustments in fiscal
1992. Tax receipts, which have been coming in at or above target in
most states, have been boosted by growth in tax bases owing to the
economic expansion. State revenue in real terms, adjusted to
exclude legislated actions, rose 3.5 percent, on average, during the
first three quarters of fiscal 1994, compared with a 1.6 percent
increase during fiscal 1993 and a small decline during the prior
fiscal year.
Prices
The major price indexes suggest that the pace of inflation has
remained relatively subdued in recent months. At the same time,
however, the warning signs of inflation would seem to be flashing a
bit more strongly, given the apparent exhaustion of labor market
slack, the persistent increases in the prices of a broad range of
industrial commodities, recent increases in crude oil prices, and

the potentially less favorable outlook for import prices in view of
recent depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the U.S.
dollar.
Consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in May, and the index
excluding food and energy was up 0.3 percent after similar increases
in the preceding three months. The increases since February in the
index excluding food and energy have been large enough to forestall
further deceleration in the twelve-month rate of change. Among
durable goods, prices of new cars rose 0.3 percent last month, and
light truck prices were up 0.8 percent. Among nondurable goods,
apparel prices increased 0.5 percent in May after an equivalent
decline in April. In addition, tobacco prices were up 1.3 percent
in May; more than half of that increase reflected the one-time
effect of higher taxes on tobacco products in Michigan. The prices
of non-energy services rose 0.2 percent in May. Owners' equivalent
rent and residential rent both posted small increases for a second
month. The volatile airfares category dropped more than 5 percent,
but auto finance costs surged nearly 4 percent, a second month of
large increases.
The CPI for food moved up 0.3 percent in May, the first monthly
rise of any consequence since December. Most of the May increase
resulted from a 2.4 percent jump in fruit and vegetable prices,
which had fallen sharply, on net, over the first four months of the
year. Prices of other food items only edged up in May, and have
increased at a 2.2 percent annual rate since December. Consumer
energy prices dropped 1 percent in May, as motor fuel, heating oil,
and natural gas all posted sizable declines. Over the past twelve
months, energy prices have fallen nearly 1-1/2 percent. However,
crude oil prices have moved up sharply since April, pointing to more
sizable increases in coming months.

Consumer price expectations had shown signs of turning up
earlier .in the spring, but those signs now seem to have dissipated
The Michigan survey showed average expectations of inflation for the
next twelve months rising to near 4-1/2 percent in March and April,
but then falling back below 4 percent in May and June (preliminary)
In addition, this survey's measure of inflation expectations over
the next five to ten years rose above 5 percent in March and April,
but then dropped back to the 4-1/2 percent range in May and June.
In the Conference Board survey, expectations held about unchanged at
around 4-1/4 percent throughout this period. That price
expectations are so high after several years of substantially slower
inflation remains a bit of a puzzle.
The PPI for finished goods declined 0.1 percent in May. Food
prices fell 0.9 percent--the fourth decline in the last five
months--and energy prices moved down 1 percent after holding
essentially flat in March and April. Excluding food and energy
items, the PPI rose 0.4 percent in May. Advances were led by the
motor vehicle sector: New car prices rose 0.8 percent last month,
and light truck prices were up 2 percent. Tobacco prices shot up
nearly 2 percent last month on a seasonally adjusted basis. In
addition, computer prices were down only 0.2 percent in May; price
declines in that component of the PPI have slowed dramatically in
the past several months. Over the twelve months ended in May, the
overall PPI declined 0.4 percent, while the PPI excluding food and
energy was up 0.4 percent. Over the three months ended in May, the
rate of rise in the PPI excluding food and energy picked up to a
2.8 percent annual rate, but this upturn may not be very meaningful
given the short-run volatility of the series.
At earlier stages of processing, the index for intermediate
materials excluding food and energy posted a rise of 0.3 percent in

May. The increase in this index over the twelve months ended in May
was a modest 1-1/2 percent. The index for crude materials other
than food and energy moved down 1.1 percent in May, after a small
decline in April that followed six months of sizable increases
Prices of logs and timber fell off slightly in May from a very high
level. By contrast, prices of copper scrap, cotton, and waste paper
rose appreciably last month.
Prices of industrial commodities generally have moved higher
since the last Greenbook, with especially large increases for
nonferrous metals such as copper and aluminum. Prices of steel
scrap and lumber have declined, on net, since mid-May but remain at
relatively high levels. The Journal of Commerce index of industrial
prices has moved up about 1-3/4 percent since the last Greenbook,
and the KR-CRB index for spot industrials has increased about
2 percent
In the markets for food commodities, some unusually strong
cross-currents have been evident in the recent price data, with the
balance seemingly pointed toward increases in food prices over the
near term and perhaps sharp increases in the PPI. Pass-through of a
recent steep decline in cattle prices likely will be a restraining
influence on retail prices for at least the next couple of months.
However, retail coffee prices seem likely to climb as the effects of
a surge in raw coffee prices begin to show up at grocery stores.
Fresh vegetable prices may also exhibit a strong upward move over
the very near term. After a stretch of several months in which the
(not seasonally adjusted) wholesale prices of vegetables had
remained in a low range, they recently have jumped sharply higher--
at a time when seasonal factors in the CPI, and especially in the
PPI, want to see further sharp declines.

1. The composites, which are constructed by the Federal Reserve staff, are
weighted averages of the percentages reported by the USDA. We have used the
following weights: excellent -1.00; good -.75; fair = .50; poor = .25; very
poor = 0. As indicated in the right-hand column, an additional index point on
the composite rating for corn appears to translate into a yield increment of
about 1-3/4 bushels per acre. Similarly, an index point for soybeans translates
into an increment in average yields of a bit more than 1/2 bushel per acre.
2. Yields are in bushels. Data for 1994 are the USDA's trend projections;
those for June 1993 are the trend projections that were available as of that
date. Other observations on yields represent the final outcomes for the years
indicated.

More important for the longer-term food price outlook is the
progress of this year's grain and oilseed crops. Production of these
crops was hurt last year by the Midwest floods and other lesser
disasters, and stocks are now at unusually low levels Planting of
this year's crops proceeded fairly smoothly during the spring, and
the condition of the crops as of late June generally was good, with
some improvement showing up as the month progressed. However,
because July and August usually are the critical months for these
crops, uncertainty about the potential size of the harvest could
persist for several more weeks despite the favorable developments to
date.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Short-term interest rates rose slightly in the wake of the
half-point increases of the federal funds and discount rates on the
day of the May FOMC meeting, while intermediate- and long-term rates
fell appreciably. Most observers interpreted the size of the action
and the accompanying press release as implying that further
tightening was unlikely soon. Major commercial banks followed the
firming moves by boosting the prime rate 50 basis points, bringing
the rate to 7-1/4 percent, and preserving its wide spread over the
federal funds rate.
Since that initial response, market interest rates generally
have been buffeted by cross-currents in economic news and weakness
in the exchange value of the dollar. In recent days, persistent
downward pressure on the dollar has prompted a backup in long-term
rates on renewed concerns about potential inflation and speculation
about System tightening. The yield on the thirty-year Treasury
bond, for example, has retraced its initial drop and now stands
slightly above the level prevailing prior to the May FOMC meeting.
Major equity price indexes are little changed to down 1-1/2 percent.
Net inflows to stock mutual funds slowed a bit in May but
appear to have increased in early June; flows to bond funds have
turned positive in recent weeks, after three consecutive monthly
declines. Retail money market funds have begun to run off,
reversing the pattern of the past couple of months when investors
moved from long-term funds into money market accounts. With the
impetus from money funds gone and opportunity costs of holding
deposits much higher, M2 growth was flat in May and appears likely

to decline in June. The weakness in M2 has shown through to M3,
which declined over the two months.
Business borrowing seems to have slowed slightly in the second
quarter and a greater portion has been concentrated in shorter-
maturity securities and in bank and finance company loans. With
long-term interest rates more than 1-1/2 percentage points above
their October lows, gross public issuance of bonds by nonfinancial
corporations has continued at a reduced pace. Bond offerings by
state and local governments also remain subdued, with few new
refundings coming to market. Treasury borrowing has declined a bit
more than seasonally in the second quarter, owing to stronger tax
receipts and continued weakness in growth of outlays. In the
household sector, available data suggest some slowing in home
mortgage borrowing, while consumer credit growth continued at a
brisk pace in April despite a substantial slowdown in auto-related
credit.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 was flat in May and is estimated to have declined at nearly
a 3 percent rate in June. The boost to M2 growth earlier in the
year that likely resulted from net redemptions of bond mutual funds
appears to have largely disappeared in recent weeks. Bond mutual
funds again began experiencing net cash inflows in late May, and
retail money funds have begun to run off. The falloff in money
growth also owes to rising opportunity costs resulting from the
increase in short-term interest rates since early this year and the
usual sluggish response of liquid deposit rates. Some household
balances have been diverted from liquid deposits to small time
deposits and thus remain within M2, while a portion has left the
monetary aggregates, as evidenced by a significant pickup in
noncompetitive tenders at Treasury auctions (chart). While retail

III-4
time deposits at banks posted increases in May and June, the first
growth in more than three years, their acceleration falls well short
of historical patterns, as depositories have not increased offering
rates on them as quickly as in past episodes of increasing market
rates. Demand deposits, and to a lesser extent money market deposit
accounts, have been weakened not only by higher opportunity costs,
but also by the continued slowing in mortgage prepayments associated
with the backup in long-term rates over the past half year. Thus,
despite sustained strong growth of currency. M1 grew at only a
2 percent rate in May and about a 4 percent rate in June, well below
its rate of growth over the past three years.

The weakness in M2 has shown through to M3, which declined at a
2-3/4 percent rate in May and appears to have been flat in June.
Institution-only money market mutual funds, whose rates have lagged
the rise in market rates, have dropped sharply, but some of the
weakness in the non-M2 part of M3 has been offset by increases in
large time deposits at banks. Banks have resumed raising funds
through issuance of large CDs, while use of nondeposit sources,
which had grown quite rapidly earlier in the year, has slowed.
Total bank credit is expected to expand at about a 4 percent
rate in June, up a bit from the very weak May pace but well below
growth registered earlier in the year. The weakness in bank credit
in May and June mainly reflected runoffs of U.S. government
securities at large domestic banks and foreign banks, after two
months of substantial acquisitions. Securities sales at two
domestic banks and one foreign bank in May accounted for a large
fraction of the decline. Reported holdings of securities in May
likely were also depressed by the revaluation of available-for-sale
and trading account securities, as bond interest rates rose on
balance over the month. Growth of other securities, meanwhile,
remained strong in May, with all of the strength recorded at
branches and agencies of foreign banks, several of which bought
large amounts of foreign government securities. In June, holdings
of government and other securities rose only slightly.
Loan growth averaged 4 percent in the May-June period.
Business loans slowed in May from a robust April pace and are
expected to expand at only a 1 percent rate in June. The slowdown
from earlier in the year mainly occurred at large domestic and

government securities considered available for sale as well as those
in trading accounts. According to the March 1994 Call Report,
60 percent of Treasury securities and 55 percent of agency pass-
throughs were classified as "available for sale," and about
4 percent of government securities were held in trading accounts.

foreign banks, which apparently had benefited from business credit
demands deflected from capital markets. Preliminary evidence from
the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending suggests that loan pricing for
some very large loans continues to be aggressive, but loan spreads
overall are little changed from a year ago. Consumer lending slowed
in both May and June, largely reflecting a strong pickup in
securitizations. Adjusted for securitizations, consumer loans
expanded at a double-digit pace in both months.
Growth of real estate loans slowed in May to near a 2 percent
rate but are expected to rise in June at about a 6 percent pace.
This would bring growth in the second quarter to about 3 percent at
an annual rate, following a flat first quarter. The March Call
Report shows that the weakness in real estate lending in the first
quarter was attributable mainly to its residential mortgage
component, although commercial lending edged down over the period.
Part of the increase in real estate loans at banks since the end of
the first quarter may owe to increased consumer demand for
adjustable-rate mortgages, which banks and savings institutions
prefer to hold in portfolio rather than to sell off. In addition,
now that opportunities for cashing out home equity provided by last
year's mortgage refinancing activity have come to an end, growth of
home equity loans has picked up to the fastest pace since April of
last year.
Mutual Funds
The weakness in mutual funds continued through mid-May, but
inflows appear to have since picked up. Data for May and for early
June show a substantial increase in net sales of equity funds, with
bond funds posting inflows for the first time since March.
Among equity funds, net sales of international funds stabilized
in May, after declining in each of the preceding two months. Trade

III-8
reports attributed the change to renewed interest in funds that
invest primarily in the Japanese market. Net sales of domestic
equity funds slowed in May, but appear to have edged up in early
June and on average remain near the healthy pace of recent quarters.

Bond funds continued to contract in May, as further outflows
from mortgage and government bond funds offset a modest turnaround
at high-yield bond funds. Weekly data for late May and early June
show small net inflows to total bond funds, the first since February
of this year. The turnaround in net sales owes mostly to income and
tax-exempt funds, as mortgage and government funds again experienced
outflows. Outflows from the latter are associated in part with
losses on investments in derivative securities. In some instances,
the funds' advisors have been forced to compensate shareholders for
derivative losses and have had to buy derivative securities from the

III-9
funds to prevent further losses. SEC staff suggest that the
published incidents are not isolated cases.
Losses requiring assistance from advisors also were recorded
for some money market mutual funds, including a few advised by
banks. Most notably, BankAmerica disclosed in June that it had
injected $17.4 million into its institutional money fund, after the
fund had to sell assets at a loss to meet heavy redemptions.
Without this injection, the net asset value of the money fund would
have dropped below the one dollar per share mark.2
Business Finance
Yields on corporate bonds have risen slightly on net over the
intermeeting period and are now about 1-1/2 percentage points above
their lows last October. As a result, issuance in the bond market
generally remained subdued, and offerings of nonfinancial firms were
concentrated in short to intermediate maturities, with greater
reliance on floating-rate issues. Gross public issuance of bonds by
nonfinancial corporations picked up a bit in May and June, but at
$7-1/2 billion, is about $3 billion short of the first-quarter pace
and less than half the average monthly pace of last year (table).
Offerings in the investment-grade sector have tended to come back
somewhat, but with issuers returning to the sidelines during
intermittent periods of market volatility. Junk bond issuance
2. Representatives at the SEC indicate that certain types of
variable-rate notes have been especially troublesome for money
funds. During periods of high interest rate volatility, structured
products such as "range notes" or "range accruals" and "index
amortizing notes," for which the note holders may receive zero
interest if rates move past a certain level in effect, can turn into
principal-only instruments and expose a fund to high levels of
market risk. There is a concern that investments in such derivative
securities could possibly lock a mutual fund into a liquidity
spiral; that is, as investors redeem shares, the fund is forced to
sell liquid securities, leaving a greater proportion of the fund's
assets in these risky securities. The SEC may deem these securities
to be unsuitable investments for money funds.

rebounded slightly in May and strengthened further in early June, as
inflows into junk bond funds resumed, bringing yield spreads in a
bit. Junk issuance, however, still remains low relative to last
year's monthly volumes.
Bond offerings by utilities have slowed markedly of late, as
negative indications regarding utility sector prospects continue to
trickle out. Moody's issued a report that suggested that the
current cost of generating electricity varies across utilities much
more than previously believed, suggesting that many of them will be
hard-pressed in a more competitive environment. Separately, Moody's
downgraded about $5.3 billion of Long Island Lighting Company's
debt, citing high costs and economic difficulties in the company's
service area, as well as concerns about the company's overall
financial flexibility. Several major California utilities remain on
Standard and Poor's CreditWatch with negative implications;
electricity prices in California are expected to come under downward
pressure owing to the state utility commission's plan to spur
competition by allowing customers to choose among suppliers.
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations
dropped sharply in May, to $2.5 billion, about half the pace of the
first four months of the year. There were no large issues, and
while the number of initial public offerings remained sizable, all
were very small. Prices and volumes of IPOs have generally come in
well below issuers' expectations. Equity issuance appears to have
edged up somewhat in June, but offerings remain sporadic. Issuance
by financial firms in June is expected to be lifted a tad over the
May pace by some large REIT offerings.
Stock prices were quite volatile over the intermeeting period,
but, on balance, most major indexes are little changed from mid-May
levels. The NASDAQ index, however, has lost ground since mid-May.

III-12
reflecting weakness in prices of small cap and high-tech businesses.
Small bank stocks have held up well, spurred in part by the
anticipation of further consolidation within the industry. Among
the industrials, the basic materials group--which includes producers
of steel, aluminum, and paper--registered the only gains since mid-
May.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term tax-exempt debt was $12.4 billion
in May, slightly above April's sluggish pace of about $10 billion.
The volume of new offerings thus far in June suggests issuance for
the month as a whole will total roughly $12 billion. As a
consequence, the second quarter will likely post the lowest level of
gross issuance since the first quarter of 1991. The slowdown
reflects a sharp drop in advance refundings. The volume of
offerings to raise new capital appears to be up slightly in the
second quarter from the reduced level recorded in 1993.
In line with past seasonal patterns, short-term volume is
estimated to have jumped in June to about $6-3/4 billion from less
than $1 billion in May. Short-term issuance will likely continue to
be heavy throughout the summer months before declining sharply over
the remainder of the year. This pattern largely reflects the
adoption of budgets at this time of the year by many state and local
government units that, in turn, authorize these entities to borrow
to cover working capital needs in the new fiscal year.
3. Attracting considerable attention in June was an offering of
100-year revenue bonds by the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey. The bonds are noncallable for thirty years and reportedly
were sold to a handful of institutional investors. The issue is
thought by market observers to be the first 100-year bond during
this century, although it is not the longest on record. In the late
1860s and early 1870s, a small municipality outside New York City,
in anticipation of being annexed by the city, sold noncallable bonds
maturing in 2147 to finance road construction.

p Preliminary.
From the last FOMC meeting through early June, yields on tax-
exempt bonds generally declined relative to those on taxable bonds.
Investors began to focus on the implication of an estimated $29
billion of bond retirements in July. Retirements of this magnitude
would represent nearly 2-1/2 percent of the outstanding stock of
tax-exempt bonds and would be more than double the level of
4retirements experienced during July in the past two years. A
4. These retirements largely represent bonds reaching their first
call date that were issued in the mid 1980s, a period of
exceptionally heavy issuance. Most of these bonds have been pre-
refunded and thus are scheduled to be redeemed. Those that have not
been pre-refunded are likely to be called and refinanced with
current offerings, as bond yields now are well below those
prevailing during the mid 1980s. January and July are the most
common anniversary months for tax-exempt bonds, and thus the level
of retirements swells during these two months relative to those in
other months.

reduction in the pace of selling by tax-exempt bond funds also
contributed to the better performance of municipal bonds. More
recently, however, renewed selling pressure from bond funds, which
apparently has come despite modest inflows of new cash, has caused
tax-exempt yields to back up more than long-term Treasury rates.
Moody's Investor Service has placed its Aa rating of
California's bonds under review for a possible downgrade. The
rating agency has expressed concern that the proposed budget for
fiscal year 1995 does not include satisfactory remedies for the
$3 billion shortfall accumulated from the past two years and a
projected $1 billion deficit in the upcoming fiscal year. The
governor's budget plan calls for the deficit to be covered with
short-term borrowing that would not be paid off fully until the 1996
fiscal year. However, the state's attorney general has stated that
this would constitute deficit financing and therefore is illegal.
Yields on outstanding California bonds were not affected by Moody's
announcement, as the bonds already trade as if they carry a lower
rating. Standard and Poor's rates California's bonds as A+.
Federal Finance
The federal budget is projected to run a small surplus in the
second quarter, reflecting the seasonal inflow of federal tax
receipts. Nonetheless, the Treasury added to its cash balance by
borrowing about $7-1/2 billion in the market, raising $31 billion in
coupon auctions while paying down $23 billion in bills. The
Treasury had pared weekly bill offerings in mid-June to $22 billion,
but more recently increased auction sizes again to $24 billion,
ahead of a sizable deficit projected for the third quarter. The
staff currently projects a third-quarter budget deficit of roughly
$57 billion, which the Treasury is expected to finance through

III-16
$50 billion of marketable borrowing, once again concentrated in
coupon offerings; bills are expected to raise only $12 billion.
During the intermeeting period, yield spreads on government-
sponsored agency securities have stabilized, but they remain above
levels prevailing before the System's tightening actions. Spreads
on ten-year issues are now about 30 basis points above Treasuries,
roughly 10 basis points greater than the fourth-quarter average.
while spreads on one-year to two-year securities have more than
doubled to near 15 basis points. Debt issuance by government-
sponsored agencies has slowed recently from the rapid first-quarter
pace, primarily because of a drop in offerings by FNMA and FHLMC.
However, gross issuance by the two housing agencies is expected to
be boosted in coming months by sales of global debentures. FNMA
sold $1.5 billion of global debentures in late June, the first ever
by a government-sponsored agency. FHLMC recently announced plans to
offer $1.5 billion of five-year global notes in July.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on conventional, thirty-year, fixed-rate
mortgages have declined roughly 30 basis points on net since the
last FOMC meeting. Initial rates on one-year, adjustable-rate
mortgages, meanwhile, have declined about 15 basis points. The
initial rate advantage of ARMs when compared to FRMs now favors ARMs
by more than 3 percentage points. Thus, with long-term interest
rates remaining well above their lows of last year, the ARM share of
loan originations at most major institutional lenders has surged.
According to the Federal Housing Finance Board, 36 percent of
conventional mortgage loans closed in May carried adjustable rates,
up from 31 percent in April and 23 percent in March. The May ARM
share is the highest proportion since June 1989.

III-17
A sign that higher mortgage interest rates may have discouraged
some homebuyers is evident in the Mortgage Bankers Association's
index of applications for loans to purchase new and existing homes,
which has continued to edge lower in recent weeks. Growth of total
real estate loans at banks slowed in May but appears to have
strengthened in June, boosting the average for the second quarter to
about a 3 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate.
In the secondary mortgage market, spreads on thirty-year
conventional, mortgage-backed pass-through securities have
fluctuated in recent weeks but have changed little, on net, despite
high volatility (chart), a flatter yield curve, and the lack of
significant demand for REMIC collateral. These factors, which
typically would be expected to exert upward pressure on mortgage-to-
Treasury yield spreads, have been offset for the most part by a
dwindling supply of new pass-through issues. Gross issuance of
agency pass-throughs slowed again in May (chart), as refinancing
volume declined further and single-family housing activity continued
to ease. Net issuance edged up in April and May but remains well
below the first quarter's record pace.
The pickup in net issuance owes in part to the slowdown in
early repayments on existing mortgage securities. With the rise in
mortgage interest rates since late last year, prepayments on agency
mortgage-backed securities have slowed sharply in recent months
(chart). The Mortgage Bankers Association's refinancing index,
meanwhile, has continued to trend downward, suggesting that
prepayments will probably slow a bit further in coming months.
In the multiclass sector, GNMA brought to market in late May
its first ever REMIC issue, backed by $500 million of 8 percent GNMA
coupons. The issue was priced at spreads 5 to 10 basis points
tighter than on REMICs backed by GNMA collateral issued by either

FNMA or FHLMC. Zero-risk weighting for risk-based capital
reportedly enhanced the willingness of insurance companies, pension
funds, and banks to pay a premium for the GNMA-issued REMIC, while
the full faith and credit guarantee attracted retail interest.
Nonetheless, FNMA, not GNMA, was the largest issuer of REMICs backed
by GNMA collateral. Out of a reported $2.6 billion in GNMA-backed
REMICs priced in May. an estimated $2 billion were brought to market
by Fannie. However, since that time, GNMA has brought four
additional issues to market.
Consumer Credit
Growth of consumer installment credit slowed in April from the
rapid advance recorded in March, but at 12-1/2 percent it remained
close to its first-quarter pace.5 Revolving credit again grew
rapidly, while growth of auto and "other" credit slowed.
Noninstallment credit contracted at a 15-3/4 percent annual rate in
April.
Interest rates on consumer loans at commercial banks edged up
between February and May. The average "most common" rate on a
forty-eight-month new car loan rose about 1/4 percentage point, to
7.8 percent--still quite low by historical standards. Rates on
personal loans and credit cards also inched up over the period to
5. The consumer installment credit data, scheduled for
publication on July 8, have been revised from 1989 forward to
incorporate annual benchmark revisions and new seasonal factor
estimates (table, bottom panel). Changes in consumer indebtedness
in earlier years were little affected by the annual benchmark
revisions; however, growth in 1992 now is estimated to have been a
bit less than estimated previously, while that for 1993 and the
first quarter of 1994 is significantly more robust. Revised
estimates for the more recent periods owe to the annual benchmarking
of some series to Call Report data and to revisions in other series
that reflect new data sources, including more complete information
on pools of securitized assets held by institutions outside of
current reporting panels. The largest overall revisions occurred in
the "other" category; securitizations data have been weakest in this
area and have benefited from the additional information received for
pools of securitized assets.

levels just above their historic lows. However, spreads between
consumer loan rates and yields on comparable Treasury securities
narrowed further (chart), as banks continued to price loans
aggressively. Reports from survey respondents in recent months
indicate that banks have been actively seeking to recapture some of
the auto lending business lost in recent years to the "captive" auto
finance companies. Competition for credit card accounts also is
reported to have increased.
Most indicators of household financial distress have remained
relatively favorable. In the first quarter, personal bankruptcy
filings continued to decline, falling more than 9 percent at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate after having dropped at a
17-1/2 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 1993. In addition, the
share of closed-end consumer loans at banks that were thirty days or
more past due was about unchanged in the first quarter, with
delinquencies on auto loans declining slightly. Revolving credit
delinquencies also were about unchanged.
First-quarter delinquency data for residential mortgages
presented a slightly mixed picture. Call Report data show a
continued decline in delinquency rates for loans at banks (chart).
In contrast, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported small
increases in thirty-day delinquency rates for both conventional and
government-backed mortgage loans at all lenders. However, both
ratios remained close to the lowest levels of the past decade. In
addition, the American Council of Life Insurance reported a small
increase in first-quarter delinquencies in residential mortgage loan
portfolios at life insurance companies.

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
In April, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was $8.4
billion, seasonally adjusted, larger than in March but smaller than
in February. For the first four months of 1994, the deficit was $98
billion at an annual rate, significantly larger than that recorded
in the fourth quarter of last year.

Exports of goods and services were 3 percent less in April than
in March; declines were recorded in most trade categories (especially
capital goods and gold) and partly reversed the sharp runup in
March. For the first four months of the year, exports (SAAR) were
only slightly lower than in the fourth quarter, and were well above
the level reported in any other previous quarter. The growth in
exports since last fall has been led by shipments of machinery
especially to expanding markets in Asia.
Imports of goods and services were about the same in April as
in March; increases in imported consumer goods, machinery, and oil
were offset by declines in other categories. All of the increase in
the value of oil was in price. For the first four months of the
year, imports (SAAR) were about 2 percent higher than in the fourth

quarter: the growth of imports was led by capital goods (particularly
machinery other than computers) and non-oil industrial supplies
(especially metals) reflecting the strength of U.S. expenditures on
business equipment and construction supplies.
The quantity of imported oil fell only slightly in April from
the strong March rate. For the first quarter, imports averaged
almost 9.0 mb/d (one half of consumption) despite a larger than
seasonal drawdown in stocks. Preliminary Department of Energy
statistics for May suggest that consumption remained strong and that
inventories were partially rebuilt, with imports remaining above 9.0
mb/d.
Prices of U.S. Imports and Exports
Prices of imported oil rose almost $1 per barrel in April and
rose further in May, consistent with the pick-up in spot and futures
prices that began in late March. In the last four months, the spot
price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) has increased almost $5 per
barrel, with roughly $1.25 of the increase coming since the May
Greenbook. Currently, the spot price for WTI is $19.15 per barrel.
The increase in oil prices appears to be the result of a pick-up in
economic activity in Europe and Japan coupled with OPEC production
restraint, as well as some near-term supply difficulties in the
North Sea and Yemen. Prices of imported oil should continue to move
with spot and futures prices, reaching about $16 per barrel in June.
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports in May rose slightly for the
third consecutive month. For April-May combined, prices rose
slightly more than in the first quarter but well within the 1-1/2 to
2-1/2 percent range recorded for the past four quarters. In April-
May, the largest increases were in foods. Prices of non-oil
industrial supplies also moved up in April and May, continuing a
pattern of increases begun in February.

Nonagricultural export prices increased slightly in May. For
April-May combined prices rose 2.2 percent at an annual rate, the
same as in the first quarter; most of the increase during both
periods was in industrial supplies.
Prices of agricultural exports continued to fluctuate, rising
in May after falling in two of the prior three months.
U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit widened by $5 billion SAAR
from 1993-Q4 to 1994-Q1. An increase in the deficit on goods and
services was partly offset by lower unilateral transfers and a small
reduction in the deficit on investment income.
Merchandise exports declined 1 percent in the first quarter
from a strong fourth-quarter level; merchandise imports rose 1
percent (primarily capital goods and industrial supplies) despite a
sharp drop in the value of imported oil. Most of the weakening in
net services derived from reduced receipts from foreigners traveling
in the United States. Unilateral transfers dropped back in Q1 from

Q4 levels that were elevated by the annual payment of grants to
Israel at the beginning of the U.S. fiscal year. Income receipts on
U.S. assets abroad rose more than income payments on assets in the
United States. Receipts on U.S. portfolio investments abroad rose
with the general level of interest rates and large outflows from the
United States of portfolio capital; payments to foreigners on
portfolio investments in the the United States fell slightly as
coupon-timing effects more than offset the impact of large capital
inflows. Net direct investment income receipts continued strong at
nearly $50 billion (SAAR) mainly reflecting strong gross receipts
from U.S. businesses operating abroad.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Banks and securities dealers again recorded large net capital
inflows in April (line 3 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table). Part of the inflow was to fund a general
expansion of bank credit during the month. In addition, about $6
billion of the inflow was attributable to increased borrowing by
securities dealers under repurchase agreements. Finally, another $5
billion of the inflow reflected a reduction of U.S. bank claims on
own foreign offices associated with the restructuring of Brazilian
debt. The restructuring replaced loans booked at the offshore
offices of U.S. banks with bonds now held by the parent banks in the
United States.
The swap of debt for bonds with Brazil accounts for nearly all
of the net purchases of foreign bonds shown on line 5a. Apart from
this transaction, and net sales of $1 billion in Mexican bonds, U.S.
activity in foreign bonds was relatively small in April. This
contrasts with the first quarter when large sales in the United
Kingdom were more than offset by purchases in continental Europe,
Canada, Mexico, and Japan. U.S. net purchases of foreign stocks

also slowed in April (line 5b). The most notable decline was in
Japan where net purchases were less than $1/2 billion after
averaging more than $3 billion per month in the first quarter.
Private foreign transactions in U.S. securities swung from
large net purchases in the first quarter to large net sales in April
(line 4). The largest swing was in U.S. treasury securities which
registered net sales of $11 billion. The swing was concentrated in
the United Kingdom and offshore financial centers. Japanese
residents purchased $1 billion in Treasuries in April, compared with
net sales of $3 billion in the first quarter. Foreign purchases of
corporate bonds slowed in April and the pace of net equity sales
increased.
Foreign official reserves in the United States declined sharply
in April, more than reversing the $11 billion increase in the first
quarter (line 1). About half of the decline in April is attribut-
able to Mexico, reflecting exchange market intervention to support
the peso after the assassination of presidential candidate Colosio
in March. Significant declines were also recorded for Singapore,
Taiwan, Spain, and Switzerland. Japanese official reserves in the
United States rose in April, although by an amount less than their
reported exchange market intervention. Partial data for May from
the FRBNY record official inflows of about $7 billion. Increases in
Japanese reserves account for about one-third of this inflow.
Recently released data for the first quarter continue to show
near-record U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6). However, a
large part of this outflow was not related to the accumulation of
plant and equipment. A few U.S. securities firms lent large amounts
to their U.K. affiliates. Since a few U.S. securities firms also
account for nearly all of the previously mentioned sales of foreign
securities to the United Kingdom, it seems likely that a large part

IV-11
of the direct investment lending went to finance U.K. affiliates'
purchases of securities from their U.S. parents. Foreign direct
investment inflows to the United States also remained high in the
first quarter (line 7), although considerably less than the record
levels reached in the late 1980s.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dollar has
declined about 4 percent on balance since the May 17 FOMC meeting.
The dollar's weighted-average value showed little net change over
the latter half of May and the first two weeks of June, but has
declined sharply since then. Perceptions that recovery in several
major foreign industrial countries is more firmly taking hold have
contributed to a rise in foreign relative to U.S. long-term interest
rates over this period. Since the May FOMC meeting, the weighted-
average of long-term interest rates in the foreign industrial
countries has increased about 55 basis points while the comparable
U.S. long-term rate has risen only about 25 basis points on balance.
The dollar's recent weakness also may have reflected in part
concerns about possible increasing inflationary pressures in the
United States, related to tightening U.S. labor market conditions.
On June 21, the dollar briefly fell below 100 yen per dollar, a
new post-war low. In response, the Bank of Japan made large-scale
intervention purchases of dollars and Treasury Secretary Bentsen
issued a public statement expressing concern about exchange market
developments. The dollar remained weak against the yen and mark
over the remainder of the week and, when the dollar began to fall
further on June 24, the Desk joined other central banks in
concerted intervention .The Desk
purchased a total of $1,560 million--$950 million against marks and
$610 against yen,

Shortly after the concerted intervention began,
Treasury Secretary Bentsen issued a statement noting the cooperation
between the United States and its G-7 partners in the day's actions,
and saying that the operations "reflect a shared concern about
recent developments in financial markets." The intervention opera-
tion appeared to have little impact on exchange rates, and the
dollar actually declined a bit further against the mark over the
course of the day.
The dollar has declined about 5-1/4 percent relative to the yen
over the intermeeting period. Earlier in the period, the dollar was
given some support against the yen when U.S. Trade Representative
Mickey Kantor announced that the United States and Japan had reached
understandings that would allow a resumption of the framework trade
talks that had been broken off in February. However, the perception
of somewhat improved U.S.-Japan trade relations was reversed and the
dollar came under strong downward pressure against the yen following
the June 7 statement by Mr. Kantor indicating that U.S. goals in
terms of access to the Japanese market had not changed, and that the
United States would open Japanese markets either through the frame-
work talks or through U.S. trade laws. The political turmoil in
Japan may also have contributed to the dollar's weakness against the
yen by raising doubts about the government's ability to take
measures to counter the yen's rise. Short-term interest rates in
Japan have shown little net change over the period.
The dollar has depreciated about 5 percent relative to the mark
since the May FOMC meeting. The mark's strength appears to have
reflected in part a growing market perception that the Bundesbank is
unlikely to make additional cuts in official interest rates in the
near-term or to reduce short-term market rates much further. A
plethora of statements by Bundesbank officials over the period have

IV-14
generally been seen as confirming this view, particularly a
statement by Bundesbank President Tietmeyer interpreted as
indicating that the May 11 lowering of the discount rate would be
the last reduction in German official rates for the time being.
Reinforcing the view that the Bundesbank will be unlikely to ease
further has been the rapid growth of the targeted M3 monetary
aggregate. As of May, M3 had grown at a 13.7 percent rate from its
fourth-quarter base, well above its 4 to 6 percent target range.
Reflecting the diminishing market assessment of the likelihood
of further Bundesbank easing, the German three-month interest rate
has eased only about 15 basis points on balance since the May FOMC
meeting, despite continued weekly reductions in the Bundesbank's
repo rate that have totaled 39 basis points over this period.
Short-term interest rates in most other European countries have
shown little net change over this period. The major exception has
been Italy, where the three-month rate has increased about 75 basis
points as the Italian lira has come under downward pressure relative
to its EMS partner currencies.
The only major foreign currency to decline against the U.S.
dollar over the intermeeting period has been the Canadian dollar,
which has depreciated about 1/2 percent on balance, apparently
reflecting continued market concerns over the upcoming Quebec
election and large government budget deficits. In response to the
downward pressure on the Canadian dollar, Canadian authorities moved
to raise the three-month interest rate about 30 basis points over
the period.
Long-term interest rates in all major foreign industrial
countries have continued to move higher since the May FOMC meeting.
The increases have ranged from about 40 basis points in Japan and
Germany to about 125 basis points in Italy. In both Japan and

IV-15
Germany, incoming data appear to have been generally interpreted by
the market as signaling increased prospects of economic recovery,
thus putting upward pressure on long-term rates. The especially
sharp rise in the Italian long-term rate followed a ruling by the
Italian Constitutional Court overturning legislation capping
increases in second pensions, potentially substantially increasing
the public sector budget deficit.
With long-term interest rates rising sharply, equity prices
have dropped in nearly all of the major foreign industrial countries
since the May FOMC meeting. The declines have varied from about 7
percent in Canada to about 13 percent the Italy; German stock
prices have fallen about 9 percent on balance over the period. The
only exception to this general decline in equity prices has been
Japan, where the Nikkei index has risen about 2 percent.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
After following divergent paths in 1993, economic activity
expanded in all the major foreign industrial countries in the first
quarter of 1994. First-quarter data suggest that each of the
countries is now past its trough. In Japan, western Germany, and
France growth resumed, after contracting or remaining flat in the
fourth quarter of last year. In Italy, monthly indicators suggest
the moderate pace of recovery evident late last year continued,
while growth in the United Kingdom and Canada remained at a healthy
pace.

IV-16
Despite the upturn in economic activity, considerable economic
slack persists. Unemployment rates remain high even in countries
where recovery is firmly established, although they have begun to
come down in the United Kingdom and Canada. Slow wage growth and
slack economic conditions have contributed to low or declining
consumer price inflation.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, GDP data released since
the May Greenbook show that real GDP rose 3.9 percent (SAAR) in the
first quarter of 1994. Most of the increase came from domestic
demand as strength in household and government expenditures more
than offset a sharp decline in private investment. Net exports also
rose, reflecting high export growth in excess of a strong increase
in imports. Because high GDP growth in the first quarter of 1993,
stimulated by government fiscal packages, was followed by a
resumption of weakening, the performance of GDP in the second
quarter of this year should provide key information on whether the
recovery is established.

Monthly data for the second quarter are mixed, but on balance
are consistent with continued, albeit slower, growth. The Bank of
Japan's May (Tankan) survey of business sentiment showed its first
increase since 1989, and firms predicted a smaller decline in
investment for FY 1994 than in the February survey. Industrial

production fell in April and May, but less than anticipated, the
unemployment rate has remained essentially flat in recent months,
and the job offers-to-applicants ratio declined slightly in May.

On June 23, the upper house of the Diet approved the budget for
FY 1994, allowing it to be enacted into law. Since the start of the
fiscal year on April 1, the government has been running on two
successive stop-gap budgets. The passage of the formal FY 1994
budget reduces uncertainties concerning the government's ability to
maintain its recent pace of fiscal stimulus, and also opens the door
to additional stimulus packages, if necessary.
On June 29, Socialist Party chairman Tomiichi Murayama was
elected prime minister by the lower house of the Diet with the
support of both Socialist Party and Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
members. Murayama succeeds Tsutomu Hata, who resigned on June 25
after only two months in office rather than risk a likely defeat in
a vote of no confidence introduced by the LDP. Since Hata assumed
the leadership of the minority government on April 25, the various
opposition parties had pledged not to attempt to replace the
government until after the budget was enacted.
Real GDP in western Germany rose 2.2 percent (SAAR) in the
first quarter, led by a surge in construction during the mild

adjusted using west German seasonal factors show a decline of 5.8
percent (AR) from fourth-quarter levels. Accordingly, for total
Germany, real GDP advanced 1.6 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter.

volume of retail sales (SA) in western Germany slumped in April,
declining more than 7 percent relative to the average level in the
first quarter. In eastern Germany, industrial production (NSA) has
continued to show strong gains, advancing 17.8 percent over the year
ending in April.

Growth of the targeted monetary aggregate M3 has moderated
since the early months of this year but remains high. In May,
German M3 increased 13.7 percent (SAAR) relative to the fourth
quarter of 1993, down from 15.4 percent in April. It appears highly
unlikely that M3 will fall within its official target range of 4 to
6 percent this year. In its mid-year review on July 21, the
Bundesbank Council is expected to evaluate this year's target range
for M3 growth.
In France, GDP growth recovered in the first quarter after
registering zero growth in the fourth quarter. The rise was largely
the result of a positive contribution from inventories as
consumption was flat and investment fell while net exports made a
large negative contribution. Although consumption of manufactured
goods registered moderate growth, it was offset by a large drop in

retail sales have slowed less than expected. After falling in
April, consumer and business confidence picked up considerably in
May. Underlying inflation continues subdued, and labor costs, after
accelerating in the first quarter, edged back somewhat in April.
In elections for the European parliament in June, the

Despite the weak showing, the Conservatives did better than expected
by retaining 19 of their current 45 seats.
Following a strong performance in the fourth quarter, growth in
Italy appears to have remained positive in the first quarter as
industrial production continued to rise and capacity utilization and
unemployment held steady. Available indicators for the second
quarter suggest that economic activity likely has continued its
gradual recovery. Industrial production on a year-over-year basis
edged down in April, but there were two fewer working days this year
compared with April 1993. Although the second quarter unemployment
rate rose, business sentiment has continued to show strength, and
consumer confidence recently has soared.

Since coming to power in May, the Berlusconi government has
implemented a series of measures to boost employment. The
government has reduced taxes for companies that create net new
employment and initiated an investment tax credit. On the spending

IV-22
side, the government plans to resume public works projects that were
suspended by corruption investigations. Because project funds
already were allocated, resumption will have no effect on this
year's deficit. The government is negotiating with labor unions
over proposals to make the labor market more flexible, such as more
freedom for employers to hire and fire workers and less stringent
rules on part-time and temporary employment. On June 14, Italy's
highest court ruled that the government must make payments that may
amount to nearly 2 percent of GDP for back years on second pensions.
The government is considering options for compliance with the court
ruling.
In Canada, economic activity expanded at a vigorous pace in the
first quarter of 1994, with consumption expenditure especially
strong. A decline in construction offset a modest increase in
machinery and equipment investment. Recent data suggest economic
activity remains robust, although retail sales fell in April after
five consecutive monthly increases. Employment continues to grow at
a steady pace, with full-time jobs more than accounting for the
increase so far this year. In 1993, full-time jobs accounted for
only 30 percent of increased employment. The unemployment rate is
still high as increased labor force participation has accompanied
employment growth.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Mexican real GDP rebounded somewhat during the first quarter of
1994, and Mexican imports and exports have expanded significantly,
due mainly to trade liberalization resulting from NAFTA. In other
developing countries, economic activity has been generally robust.
During the first quarter of 1994, real GDP grew (year/year) by 5.7
percent in Brazil, by 5.5 percent in Taiwan, and by 9.1 percent in
Korea. Chinese industrial production during May was 17 percent
above its year-earlier level. Argentina continues to experience an
investment boom: construction expenditure and capital goods imports
have increased sharply.
Brazil will introduce a new currency on July 1, as part of a
program to tame its 40 percent monthly inflation rate. Russian
consumer prices increased by 8.1 percent during May, the smallest
increase since October 1991. Venezuela, in the midst of a banking
and financial crisis, implemented foreign exchange and price
controls on June 27.
Individual country notes. Mexico's real GDP was 0.5 percent
higher in the first quarter of 1994 than in the same period last
year. This is the first quarter of positive year-over-year growth
following two quarters of contraction. Imports in January-April
1994 were 17.5 percent higher than in the same four months of 1993,
reflecting in part the lowering of trade barriers as NAFTA went into
effect. Exports in January-April were 15.7 percent higher than a
year earlier (even though petroleum exports were 17.3 percent
lower), as non-oil exports increased by 21.8 percent. As a result,
the cumulative four-month trade deficit was $1 billion higher than a
year earlier.

IV-27
The monthly inflation rate was 0.5 percent in May, unchanged
since February, leaving the May CPI 6.9 percent higher than a year
earlier.
The financial crisis that gripped Mexico after the leading
presidential candidate was assassinated on March 23 abated in May.
However, nervousness returned in June when the Chiapas rebels
rejected the tentative peace agreement negotiated in February.
Further volatility ensued when the chief government peace negotiator
resigned June 16, complaining that his effectiveness had been
undermined by critical comments from government party presidential
candidate Ernesto Zedillo.
As shown on the following table, which charts the behavior of
Mexican financial markets, on June 28 the peso was only 0.3 percent
above the lower limit of its fluctuation band against the dollar,
having depreciated by 8.4 percent since mid-February. Also on June
28, the Mexico City stock market closed 22.5 percent below its
February all-time high and 14 percent above its 1994 low. The rate
on 3-month peso-denominated Treasury bills at the June 29 auction
was 16.5 percent, up sharply from 9.1 percent in mid-February.
In Brazil, economic activity remains robust. Real GDP rose by
5.7 percent in the first quarter of 1994 over a year earlier, led by
strong performance in agriculture. Monthly inflation in May,
however, was 42 percent, continuing the high level seen in recent
months. The cumulative trade surplus for the year through April
1994 was $4.2 billion, down from a surplus of $4.9 billion over the
same period in 1993. Imports grew by 13 percent, while exports
stagnated. The deterioration in the trade balance reflects strong
internal demand, trade liberalization, and a 12.5 percent
appreciation of the real exchange rate between Q1 1993 and Q1 1994.

On July 1, Brazil will introduce a new currency, the "real," as
part of its current anti-inflation program. The government
announced in mid-June that the real will be temporarily pegged to
the dollar and will be backed "in part" by international reserves.
Finance Minister Ricupero recently stated that the government is
willing to commit as much as $10 billion in reserves to support the
new currency. (Total international reserves were $38 billion at the
end of April.) Nevertheless, in a recent survey of Brazilians, over
half the respondents did not believe that the anti-inflation program
would succeed.
In Argentina, the ongoing investment boom is contributing to
higher industrial output and a larger trade deficit. During the
first quarter of 1994, gross fixed investment was over 30 percent
higher than a year earlier, reflecting large construction
expenditures and an increase of 110 percent in capital goods
imports. Industrial production during January-April was about 7
percent higher than a year earlier, surpassing the previous cyclical
peak reached in 1987. Consumer prices in May were 3.3 percent
higher than a year earlier.
According to preliminary estimates, exports during January-May
were up about 9 percent (year/year), as strong manufactured exports
swamped the influence of a poor wheat harvest. Soaring capital
goods imports, however, generated a 46 percent increase in total
imports during January-April, causing the trade deficit to widen to
$1.85 billion from $186 million over the same period last year.
Faced with weak grain exports and a burgeoning trade deficit, the
Menem administration has announced tax measures to encourage the
agricultural sector to increase exports.
On June 14, authorities in Venezuela intervened and closed
eight financial institutions holding more than 20 percent of the

IV-30
public's deposits in the banking system. These institutions had
received about $3 billion in credit from the deposit insurance
agency and the central bank since January. Despite government
assurances that all eight institutions would resume operations by
June 20, only three banks had been reopened by the end of June.
Continued large monetary emissions to the financial system
stimulated a jump in monthly consumer price inflation to 5 percent
in May and an estimated 5.5 percent in June, up from 3 percent per
month a year earlier. Rising inflation and falling confidence in
the banking system contributed to a renewed surge in capital flight
and currency depreciation. The central bank spent an estimated $1
billion in foreign exchange in June (about 20 percent of its
international reserves, excluding gold) to support the bolivar.
Nevertheless, the bolivar lost 21 percent of its value over nine
days, and closed at about 200 bolivars per dollar on June 23, down
from 106 bolivars per dollar at the beginning of the year.
On June 27, President Caldera announced the immediate adoption
of foreign exchange and price controls and the suspension of various
constitutional guarantees concerning civil and economic rights. The
central bank suspended foreign exchange trading until currency
control measures are implemented on July 6. Price controls were
imposed on about 100 basic goods and services. In a nationally
televised speech, Caldera also promised to provide public subsidies
to reduce the cost of food and transport to low-income households.
Since Caldera received strong support for the emergency measures
from opposition party leaders, the Venezuelan congress is likely to
expedite its approval of the decree.
Growth and inflation in China remain high, while the trade
deficit appears to be narrowing. Industrial production rose 17
percent in May over a year earlier, after an 18 percent increase in

IV-31
April. Consumer prices were up 21 percent in May (year/year): in 35
major cities, prices increased by 23 percent. During the first five
months of 1994, the trade deficit was $1.8 billion, down from $3.1
billion in the same period last year. Exports rose 24 percent, and
imports rose 18 percent.
Official reports indicate that China eased credit controls in
May and June, largely in response to the number of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) that were unable to meet their payrolls. In
June, Chinese authorities ordered most of the country's 40-odd
futures exchanges to cease trading, and prohibited brokerages from
placing orders on international markets. Many SOEs have been active
traders on international futures markets, reportedly losing large
amounts of money.
Real GNP growth in Taiwan was 5.5 percent in the first quarter
of 1994 (year/year), compared with 6.3 percent growth in the same
period last year. Exports, through May, were up 3.7 percent over
the same period a year earlier, while imports were up 7.2 percent.
Consumer prices were 4.3 percent higher in May than a year earlier.
In recent months, Taiwan has taken steps to liberalize its
financial sector. It is opening the insurance market to all foreign
insurers, and it has lifted its ban on foreigners establishing new
commercial banks. The authorities also agreed to raise the ceiling
on foreign investment in Taiwan's stock market to 10 percent of
total capitalization, an increase of about 35 percent over the
previous fixed-dollar limit.
Economic recovery in Korea is firmly established. Real GDP
increased by 9.1 percent in the first quarter of 1994 from a year
earlier. Strong growth has been fueled, in part, by a recovery in
fixed capital investment from the depressed levels recorded in the
first half of 1993; capital investment during the first quarter of

IV-32
1994 increased by 13.5 percent, compared with the same period last
year. Despite strong growth, inflation has slowed somewhat.
Consumer prices were 5.7 percent higher in May 1994 than a year
earlier.
Merchandise imports increased by 14.1 percent in the first four
months of 1994 from a year earlier, while exports grew by 8 percent.
This contributed to a widening of the current account deficit for
the first four months of 1994 to $2.8 billion from $700 million a
year earlier.
In Russia, consumer prices increased by only 8.1 percent in
May, a 30-month low. Industrial production, however, continued to
contract. According to official statistics, industrial production
during April and May was 28 percent lower than during the same
period a year ago; the accuracy of these figures, however, is
increasingly questioned, since they do not appear to capture the
burgeoning growth of the private sector.
Since late-February, the ruble has depreciated against the
dollar at a steady rate of 1 percent a week. On June 29, the MICEX
ruble-dollar exchange rate was 1992. During the last two months,
the Central Bank of Russia has progressively lowered its monthly
refinance rate from 17.5 percent to 14.2 percent, still well above
the monthly inflation rate.
In mid-June, the Russian government reversed a November 1993
decree prohibiting foreign banks from serving Russian customers.
This reversal, however, applies only to banks from countries that
have allowed Russian banks to enter. Since Russian banks have not
satisfied regulatory requirements to enter the United States
(indeed, only one Russian bank has made formal application for
entry), U.S. banks are still banned from serving Russian customers.

IV-33
On June 24, the Russian parliament approved the 1994 budget.
The final version outlines a deficit estimated at 9.5 percent of
1994 GDP. (Russia's fiscal accounting procedures deviate from IMF
conventions; the deficit falls to slightly below 9 percent of GDP
when IMF conventions are used.) Russia's Systemic Transformation
Facility with the IMF authorizes a deficit of only 7.2 percent of
GDP. Nonetheless, the IMF has not criticized the budget, perhaps
because the government showed significant commitment to fiscal
discipline by rejecting the military's demands for large funding
increases.
